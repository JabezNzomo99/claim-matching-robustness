This time, a tweeter shared a photo of a groom being held up by his four groomsmen as he kissed his bride.\u201dHe\u2019s paralyzed, but his friends held him up to get married ?? Those are real friends ???,\u201d @EllaBandzzz tweeted, as she posted the moving photo \u2026 posted on 11th December, is so touching that it\u2019s been retweeted nearly 1.5 thousand times, and has over 1,000 Likes.\n\nCosmopolitan eventually ceded that the picture\u2019s backstory was most likely not as described, but only following multiple emoji-laden paragraphs that created the opposite impression. At best, it seemed odd to leap to the conclusion that the groom was being \u201cheld up\u201d by several groomsmen in a pose that made no sense for its intended purpose; at worst, it seemed social media hucksters decided to use a random couple\u2019s wedding photographs to hawk a made-up story for pageviews.\n\nThe Reddit thread responsible for the image\u2019s viral spread was full of impossible-to-ignore comments at the top, in which users disputed the claim because they recognized the pose in the photograph immediately:\n\nAlthough blogs and viral picture sites were quite likely sourcing the image from Reddit, none of them appeared to note the large consensus that the photograph depicted a common \u201cfraternity pose.\u201d The web site Diply responsibly covered the claims, identifying Instagram user Rita Shaw and new husband Jared as the image\u2019s subjects:\n\nWhen Rita Shaw posted this lovely moment from her wedding on Instagram three weeks ago, she probably wasn\u2019t surprised with the number of likes it received. After all, it\u2019s a stunning photo that obviously captured an extremely meaningful moment for her and her husband. However, I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t expect someone to then post the image on reddit with the caption: \u201cGroomsman hold up paralyzed groom for his wedding.\u201d Take the beautiful wedding photo of Rita and Jared Shaw as a perfect example of just how quickly and easily a fake story can come to life. All it took was a misinformed reddit post to cause this couple\u2019s special photo to go viral, but not for a reason they would have ever expected \u2026 I set out to find the truth behind this inspiring image, and eventually, I found the original, which, as I said before, was posted on Instagram by the bride, Rita Shaw \u2026 Along with her image was the caption: \u201cHappy Founders day to the good Bruhz #RQQ.\u201d After looking up #RQQ, I found out that it represented Omega Psi Phi, an international fraternity that was founded in 1911 by Howard University students.\n\nAlso included were several images of Jared Shaw, standing and dancing without the assistance of his groomsmen:\n\nThe viral image and its fabricated backstory were considered by many viewers to be harmless and inspiring, but the newly-married Shaws likely had no desire for memories of their special day to be marred by a viral lie. The false backstory was an example of the particularly unsavory practice of reducing disabled people to objects of motivational sentiment (\u201cinspiration porn\u201c), eliding the difficulties they face and reducing them to one-dimensional plot devices in syrupy yarns.\n\nWe contacted Rita Shaw via Instagram for comment but have not yet received a response. (Her account has since been set to \u201cprivate.\u201d)", "lang": "en"}
