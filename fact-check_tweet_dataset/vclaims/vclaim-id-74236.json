No, that's not true. There is no record of the 40th president of the United States ever making that statement, which has erroneously been attributed to him. Two officials from his presidential library confirmed that those words were not said by President Reagan.\n\nThe claim appeared as a meme in a post (archived here) shared on Facebook on July 17, 2020. The text at the bottom of a photo of Reagan meme read \"It's 2020. Does what President Reagan said in 1987. Look familiar to you today?\" Above that, was a purported quote by President Reagan:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nA glaring error is Reagan is misspelled in the post as \"Regan.\"\n\nThere is no evidence that Reagan ever said those words.\n\nMelissa Giller, the chief marketing officer at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute since 2001, told USA TODAY:\n\nI have access to a database where I can search all of President Reagan's quotes. I searched the quote multiple ways using phrases from the post, and there is absolutely zero records of him saying this. This is not a true quote.\"\n\nMichael Pinckeny, an archivist at the Reagan Library, told Snopes.com that it's not a real quote from Reagan:\n\nThis quote states President Reagan said this in 1987. We have all his official speeches and I could not find this quote for that year or any other between 1981-89.\"", "lang": "en"}
