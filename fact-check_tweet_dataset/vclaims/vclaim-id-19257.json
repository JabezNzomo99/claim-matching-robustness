{"title": "Did Rick Perry Fall For A Years-Old Social Media Privacy Hoax?", "subtitle": "Posting a \"legal notice\" to a social media account has no real effect on the social platform, either.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2019-08-21T11:29:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-19257", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rick-perry-instagram-hoax/", "vclaim": "On Aug. 20, 2019, U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry posted a notice on Instagram informing that company that \u201cit is strictly forbidden to disclose, copy, distribute, or take any other action against me based on this profile and/or its contents.\u201d Though he later deleted it, the shared text falsely claimed that posting such a notice would legally prevent the company from using the material he posted to the platform:\n\nPerry was not alone in sharing this purported legal advice. Several celebrities including Judd Apatow, Debra Messing, Taraji P. Henson, Julia Roberts, Julianne Moore, and Usher also shared the same picture.\n\nNothing contained in this viral text is true. A spokesperson for Facebook, which owns Instagram, told BuzzFeed News that \u201cthere\u2019s no truth to this post.\u201d In fact, the text contained within it is merely a re-purposed version of one of the most pervasive viral hoaxes of the social media era, as we recently noted in a post on Snopes\u2019 Instagram account:\n\nSince at least 2012, people have littered Facebook with some variation of a legal notice intended to prevent the social media company from making users\u2019 posts public. The current iteration merely replaces the word \u201cFacebook\u201d with \u201cInstagram.\u201d Snopes\u2019 debunking of the Facebook claim remains one of the most heavily trafficked fact checks in our database to this day.\n\nAfter being informed of the error, Perry deleted the post. Poking fun at himself, he later posted this \u201cnotice\u201d to Instagram:\n\nThe Department of Energy is responsible, in part, for safeguarding America\u2019s nuclear energy secrets.", "lang": "en"}
