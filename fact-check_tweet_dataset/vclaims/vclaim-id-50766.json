In a Sept. 13 letter to the committee, the general counsel of the director of national intelligence said that \u201ccomplaint involves confidential and potentially privileged communications by persons outside the Intelligence Community.\u201d In his own letter that day, Schiff wrote that because of that language, and because the DNI refused to affirm or deny that White House officials were involved in the decision not to forward the complaint, the committee can conclude only that \u201cthe serious misconduct involves the president of the United States and/or other senior White House or administration officials.\u201d\n\nCooper: \u201cJust to be clear, you don\u2019t know who this alleged whistleblower is or what they are alleging?\u201d Schiff: \u201cI don\u2019t know the identity of the whistleblower.\u201d Cooper: \u201cAnd they haven\u2019t contacted you or their legal representation hasn\u2019t contacted you?\u201d Schiff: \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into any particulars. I want to make sure that there\u2019s nothing that I do that jeopardizes the whistleblower in any way.\u201d\n\nThis is a classic dodge \u2014 \u201cdon\u2019t want to get into any particulars\u201d \u2014 and Cooper failed to follow up. Notice how Schiff quickly answered whether he knew the identity of the whistleblower \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d \u2014 but then sidestepped the questions about whether the committee had been contacted. But in doing so, he managed not to mislead; he just simply did not answer the question.\n\nSam Stein: \u201cHave you heard from the whistleblower? Do you want to hear from the whistleblower? What protections could you provide to the whistleblower?\u201d \u2026 Schiff: \u201cWe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower. We would like to. But I am sure the whistleblower has concerns that he has not been advised, as the law requires, by the inspector general or the director of national Intelligence just how he is supposed to communicate with Congress, and so the risk to the whistleblower is retaliation.\u201d\n\n\u201cRegarding Chairman Schiff\u2019s comments on \u2018Morning Joe,\u2019 in the context, he intended to answer the question of whether the Committee had heard testimony from the whistleblower, which they had not,\u201d a committee spokesman told The Fact Checker. \u201cAs he said in his answer, the whistleblower was then awaiting instructions from the Acting DNI as to how the whistleblower could contact the Committee. Nonetheless he acknowledges that his statement should have been more carefully phrased to make that distinction clear.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman pointed to an interview with Schiff by the Daily Beast, in which he said that he \u201cdid not know definitively at the time if the complaint had been authored by the same whistleblower who had approached his staff.\u201d But he added that he \u201cshould have been much more clear.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s some more dissembling. Schiff says that if not for the IG, the committee might never have known about the complaint. But his committee knew that something explosive was going to be filed with the IG. As the New York Times put it, the initial inquiry received by the committee \u201calso explains how Mr. Schiff knew to press for the complaint when the Trump administration initially blocked lawmakers from seeing it.\u201d\n\nSchiff, however, does qualify that this was a complaint alleging \u201can urgent concern,\u201d and it\u2019s not clear whether the initial inquiry had tipped off the committee staff that it would rise to that level. Still, Schiff\u2019s phrasing was misleading because he gives no hint that the committee was aware a potentially significant (\u201cprivileged\u201d) complaint might have been filed.\n\n\u201cAs Chairman Schiff has made clear, he does not know the identity of the whistleblower, has had no communication with them or their attorney, and did not view the whistleblower\u2019s complaint until the day prior to the hearing with the DNI when the ODNI finally provided it to the Committee,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cWhistleblowers frequently come to the committee. Some whistleblowers approach the IG without notice to the Committee, and some who do go to the IG do not necessarily file a complaint. However, this was the first whistleblower complaint provided to the Committee this year that the IC IG determined to be of \u2018urgent concern\u2019 and \u2018credible,\u2019 and Chairman Schiff would have raised the alarm regardless when it was illegally withheld.\u201d\n\nBut Schiff on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d clearly made a statement that was false. He now says he was answering the wrong question, but if that was the case, he should have quickly corrected the record. He compounded his falsehood by telling reporters a few days later that if not for the IG\u2019s office, the committee would not have known about the complaint. That again suggested there had been no prior communication.", "lang": "en"}
