Looking at the latest data for 2014/15, this figure has not changed. For non-grammar schools in the same area, the Sutton Trust found that 18% of pupils were eligible for free school meals.\n\nThat isn\u2019t just down to differences in ability. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has found that \u201camongst high achievers, those who are eligible for free school meals or who live in poorer neighbourhoods are significantly less likely to go to a grammar school\u201d.\n\nIt said the question remains whether this is because poorer children are less likely to apply or less likely to get in once they apply.\n\nGrammar school pupils are much less likely to be from deprived areas. Ofsted rank schools based on the average level of deprivation found at the postcodes of pupils from the school: 1 means the pupils are from the least deprived postcodes and 5 means they are on average from the most deprived.\n\n40% of grammar schools achieved a 1 rating, compared to 20% of non-selective secondary schools. In contrast, less than 1% of grammar schools achieved a 5 rating, compared to 21% of non-selective secondary schools.\n\nPupils with the same level of maths at key stage two, or between the age of seven and eleven, were more likely to go to a grammar school if they did not receive free school meals according to a study of students between 2009/10 and 2011/12 by the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\n\nThe government has acknowledged that pupils eligible for free school meals are less likely to go to grammar schools. It says it wants to find out more about the impact of selective education on pupils from low income backgrounds who aren\u2019t eligible for free school meals.\n\nEvidence suggests pupils who get into grammar schools perform better than they would under comprehensive education, and pupils who don\u2019t perform worse.", "lang": "en"}
