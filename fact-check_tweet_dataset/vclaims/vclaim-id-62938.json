Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of people standing on Ram Setu (near Dhanushkodi, Tamil Nadu) in the middle of Indian Ocean. Fact: The video is shot at Ponnani beach in Kerala. It shows people walking on the newly-formed sandbed post the floods in Kerala in 2018. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nIf we look at the video in the post carefully, at the bottom left, a watermark \u2018Abhilash Viswa Photography\u2019 can be seen. So, when we searched on Facebook to know if there is any photographer with that name, a profile \u2018Abhilash Viswa\u2019 was found. The same video was posted by him on his Facebook account in September 2018. But the description accompanying the video mentions that the video was shot at Ponnani Beach.\n\nAlso, after the video he shot went viral, as the one shot at Ram Setu, Abhilash Viswa clarified in another Facebook pos that it was taken at Ponnani beach in Kerala and not at Ram Setu.\n\nVarious news agencies had also published articles that a sandbed was formed across the sea at Ponnani beach post the floods in Kerala in 2018.\n\nTo sum it up, a video shot in 2018 at Ponnani beach in Kerala is being shared as \u2018People standing on Ram Setu in Tamilnadu\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
