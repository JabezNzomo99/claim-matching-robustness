We were interviewing replacements at the FBI. Did you know Mueller was one of the people that was being interviewed? \u2026 So, now what happens is, he leaves the office. . . . The next day, he is appointed special counsel. I said, what the hell is this all about? Talk about conflicts? But he was interviewing for the job.\u201d\n\nThe Mueller report documented that Trump\u2019s complaint of conflicts was false. The president\u2019s advisers \u2014 including then-White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, then-White House counsel Donald McGahn and then-aide Stephen K. Bannon \u2014 \u201cpushed back on his assertion of conflicts, telling the President they did not count as true conflicts,\u201d the report said. Bannon told investigators that he \u201crecalled telling the President that the purported conflicts were \u2018ridiculous\u2019 and that none of them was real or could come close to justifying precluding Mueller from serving as Special Counsel.\u201d The report said that Mueller was not interviewed to be FBI director and did not express interest in the position, as he had already served in the job for 12 years.\n\n\u201cAlthough the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities,\u201d the special counsel's report says. Mueller declined to reach a decision on whether to bring charges against Trump for obstructing justice. The special counsel also did not make an explicit recommendation to Congress on impeachment.\n\nBut Mueller spent nearly half of the report laying out a sustained effort by Trump to derail the investigation, including an effort by the president to have Mueller removed. \u201cIf we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,\u201d the report says. \u201cBased on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment. The evidence we obtained about the President\u2019s actions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he is a total conflicted person. I think Mueller is a true Never Trumper. He\u2019s somebody that dislikes Donald Trump. He\u2019s somebody that didn\u2019t get a job that he requested that he wanted very badly, and then he was appointed. And despite that \u2014 and despite $40 million, 18 Trump haters, including people that worked for Hillary Clinton and some of the worst human beings on Earth \u2014 they got nothing.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
