It\u2019s false.\n\nThis bogus story and versions of it have been circulating on the internet for more than a year. It dates to at least Feb. 25, 2016, when it appeared on CannaSOS, a self-described \u201csocial platform for the cannabis world.\u201d The website says it provides \u201clittle to no restrictions on the content of your posts.\u201d The story was posted by Dr. Weed and labeled as \u201chumor.\u201d\n\n\u201cNASA is currently looking for volunteers to participate in their \u2018Rest Studies\u2019, in which participants will have to spend 70 straight days in bed and smoke different types of cannabis, receiving $18,000 for the period of aggressive bodily atrophy,\u201d Dr. Weed\u2019s post says.\n\nDr. Weed\u2019s post is a mix of truth and fiction. NASA does conduct what it calls \u201cbed-rest studies\u201d for up to 70 days \u201cto see how the body adapts to weightlessness.\u201d The space agency has been conducting such studies for years.\n\nRob Hoffman, a writer for the Plaid Zebra, which describes itself as the \u201cunconventional lifestyle magazine,\u201d wrote a story about the NASA studies in 2014 and the purpose of the experiments.\n\nA month earlier, Andrew Iwanicki wrote a first-person account of his experience as a NASA test subject from his bed at the NASA Flight Analog Research Unit, which is located at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas. His story, which appeared Nov. 3, 2014, on Vice, included photos and carried the headline: \u201cNASA Is Paying Me $18,000 to Lie in Bed for Three Months.\u201d\n\nDr. Weed\u2019s post took all of Hoffman\u2019s story and some photos of Iwanicki in his NASA bed to create every pothead\u2019s fantasy by adding some bogus information about endless days of smoking weed.\n\nFor example, Dr. Weed\u2019s post takes Hoffman\u2019s explanation about how \u201cbed rest is a good way of simulating travel through zero gravity space,\u201d as excerpted above, and then adds this line at the end: \u201cThey also want to understand how marijuana will influence on the body.\u201d\n\nThere was nothing in Hoffman\u2019s story about study participants smoking marijuana. In fact, Iwanicki said in a 2015 interview, \u201cYou have to be completely clean of any drugs; they test for alcohol, nicotine and caffeine. You can\u2019t even be taking applied vitamin pills.\u201d\n\nNASA\u2019s guidelines for bed-rest studies say that \u201ctest subjects shall be screened for the use of drugs, alcohol, and nicotine during the selection procedure.\u201d The space agency rejects applicants who are found to be abusing drugs or alcohol, the guidelines say.\n\nIn a statement, NASA told us that it is currently not conducting any bed-rest studies, but participants in past studies were not allowed to consume drugs or alcohol.\n\n\u201cWe are no longer conducting bed rest studies at UTMB in Galveston. That facility is closed,\u201d the NASA statement said. \u201cParticipants in past bed rest studies at UTMB were not allowed to smoke marijuana or drink alcohol.\u201d\n\nSo why is this 15-month-old story circulating on Facebook? We find that viral stories that are too good to be true never die. They just get reposted again and again and again.\n\nIn fact, Dr. Weed\u2019s post was reposted on the same website \u2014 CannaSOS \u2014 only four months later by \u201cAnna\u201d on June 22, 2016. It was also labeled \u201chumor.\u201d\n\nMore recently, the NASA pot story was posted Dec. 24, 2016, on the website Mysterious Earth and then two days later on another website called Reflection of Mind. It was also posted Jan. 2 on thesolexchange.com \u2014 a website dedicated to sneakers that describes itself as the \u201cstock market of sneakers\u201d on its Facebook page. There were no notations indicating that those posts were meant as a joke.\n\nThe thesolexchange.com post was the one that was brought to our attention by Facebook users. But little has changed since Dr. Weed posted his humor piece last year. Some wording is different and the photos are comical. One photo is a screen grab of humans sleeping in pods from the 1979 movie \u201cAlien.\u201d The headline and the bulk of the story, however, are virtually the same. And it is as false now as it was 15 months ago.\n\nWe suspect that \u2014 despite our best efforts \u2014 this bogus claim will not only resurface, but go international. NASA told us that it plans to do future bed-rest studies at :envihab in Cologne, Germany. The :envihab facility is operated by the Institute for Aerospace Medicine at the German Space Agency (DLR).\n\n\u201cWe have future studies planned at :envihab in Cologne,\u201d the NASA statement read. \u201cNASA\u2019s Human Research Program is working with DLR\u2019s :envihab to investigate possible changes in astronaut health and performance on future space missions. The selected proposals will focus on resolving the largest risks to astronaut health, including vision impairment, behavioral health, bone loss, cardiovascular alterations and immunological function during missions beyond low Earth orbit. These studies are yet to begin.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201cLying Around: Earlier this year Heather Archuletta experienced what it\u2019s like to be in space \u2014 well, sort of.\u201d NASA. 23 Sep 2008.\n\nIwanicki, Andrew. \u201cNASA Is Paying Me $18,000 to Lie in Bed for Three Months.\u201d 3 Nov 2014.\n\nHoffman, Rob. \u201cNASA will pay you $18,000 to stay in bed for 70 straight days.\u201d Plaid Zebra. 29 Dec 2014.\n\nLuo, Benny. \u201cMeet the Man NASA Paid $18,000 to Lie in Bed For 70 Days Straight.\u201d 9 Sep 2015.\n\n\u201cNASA will pay you 18000 USD to stay in bed and smoke weed for 70 straight days.\u201d Dr. Weed.
