The claim is false, the image has been doctored from an original photo of Uno on a plane.\n\nThis Facebook post, published March 28, 2019, and shared more than 9,400 times since, contains an image purporting to show Erdogan making a two-fingered pointing gesture, which in Indonesia is seen as a sign of support for Subianto and Uno.\n\nSubianto is the sole challenger of incumbent President Joko Widodo in Indonesia\u2019s April 17, 2019 election and Uno is his running mate. Here is the list of candidates on the website of the country\u2019s General Elections Commission.\n\nTranslated to English, the post\u2019s caption says in capital letters: \u201cThe world awaits Prabowo and Sandi!\u201d, referring to the opposition candidates\u2019 first names.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe mostly black-and-white image contains a logo in the top-right-hand corner with the names \u201cPrabowo\u201d and \u201cSandi\u201d and a red bird \u2013 a symbol which also appears on the pair\u2019s campaign website here.\n\nThere is also the word \u201cErdogan\u201d and writing purporting to be the Turkish president\u2019s signature in the top-left-hand corner of the image.\n\nThis January 17, 2019 report by Indonesian news outlet Bisnis.com is about the two-fingered pointing gesture made by Subianto and Uno during their campaign.\n\nThe image has been doctored; a Google reverse image search and further keyword searches led to this Instagram post published February 2, 2019 by Teuku Riefky Harsya, a member of the Indonesian house of representatives.\n\nThe post, embedded below, contains a colour photograph of Uno and Harsya sitting next to each other on a plane and both making the two-finger pointing gesture with their right hand.\n\nIn the misleading image shared on Facebook, Erdogan\u2019s face has been pasted on Uno\u2019s body and the whole picture has been made black and white.\n\nBelow is a comparison between screenshots of the doctored Facebook image (top) and Harsya\u2019s Instagram post (below).\n\nCorresponding features include Uno\u2019s right hand with a white bangle on it, the distinctive light collar of his dark shirt with the number \u201c02\u201d on the shoulder, and the plane\u2019s window.\n\n\u201c02\u201d refers to Subianto and Uno\u2019s candidate number, also listed on the General Elections Commission site.\n\nIn the bottom-right-hand corner of the misleading image are the words \u201cPhotoGrid\u201d. A Google search reveals that this is a photo-editing app.\n\nThe PhotoGrid app\u2019s description here on Google Play says: \u201cCreate fun, one-of-a-kind layouts by remixing your own photos and sharing them on social platform!\u201d\n\nA Google Images keyword search for \u201cErdogan\u201d found the original picture of his face used in the misleading Facebook post. It appears in this profile of him published by Forbes magazine.\n\nThe picture of Erdogan has been cropped, rotated and made black-and-white, as can be seen in the image below comparing screenshots of the misleading post (L) and the Forbes article (R):\n\nSome small tufts of Uno's hair can still be seen poking out behind Erdogan's head in the doctored image.\n\nIndonesian news organisations have also published their own fact-checks on the misleading post, for example this Tempo report and this Liputan6 report.", "lang": "en"}
