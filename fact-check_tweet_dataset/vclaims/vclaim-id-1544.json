But the sample contained more people leaning towards Remain, and we don\u2019t know how many went on to vote Leave.\n\nA poll for ORB just after the referendum showed that the public broke 48% to 37% in favour of staying in the single market over limiting EU immigration (unlikely to be possible in the single market). Similar preferences were recorded in some of the other polls in June and July.\n\nBut others say the opposite. In a poll this month, YouGov found a clear preference for leaving the single market in order to limit immigration.\n\nPolling expert John Curtice suggests this shows that \u201cmany voters do not have very firm views about which is the more important objective\u201d.\n\nPeople seem to have different priorities when the question is put a different way., When asked how much of their personal income they would sacrifice to reduce immigration, less than 40% were prepared to pay anything.\n\nIn all these cases, Leave voters were much more prepared to trade economic benefits for lower immigration than voters generally.", "lang": "en"}
