The clip shows policemen, their mouths covered with masks, apprehending a man walking down a street. A medical officer takes the man\u2019s temperature while another puts a mask on his face. The cops lift the man, put him in an ambulance and take him away. Facebook user Saheed Baba Jivan Singh Ji posted the viral video and wrote, \u201cCoronavirus patients arrested by Punjab police and a team of doctors from all over the world. Note- Please check this out in Ludhiana.\u201d This video has been viewed over 6,000 times.\n\nAnother Facebook user shared the viral video and wrote in Hindi, \u201cWhen Punjab government learnt that this person returned from abroad and he showed symptoms of coronavirus they made him come outside his home and took him to hospital. See how they took him to hospital.\u201d\n\nAlt News has received several requests to fact-check the viral video on WhatsApp (+91 76000 11160) and on our official Android application. This claim was massively shared on Facebook.\n\nAt 1:16 mark, the ambulance\u2019s number plate \u2013 PB31 H 9195 \u2013 is revealed in the viral video.\n\nAlt News searched the number plate and found that the ambulance is registered at the District Transport Office Mansa. Coverfox, an insurance company, also states that PB31 code is for Mansa. Keeping this information in mind, Alt News performed a keyword search on Twitter and found a fact-check report of Vishwas News.\n\nVishwas News report has cited a Punjabi Jagran report from March 13 which states that Rapid Response Team, comprising doctors and police, conducted a mock drill to tackle a coronavirus patient in Buladha village, 26 km from Mansa.\n\nAlt News compared the people in the viral video with the image in Punjabi Jagran (rightmost image) and identified three people who appear in both the clips.\n\nAt the 26-second mark, we notice a doctor recording the drill on his phone and the man in the yellow shirt without a mask can be seen smiling. Thus, further suggesting that the video does not represent a real incident.\n\nOn March 14, Facebook page District Public Relations Office Mansa addressed the viral misinformation and clarified that the video doing the rounds represents a mock drill.\n\nTherefore, a mock drill video of Punjab police apprehending a suspected COVID-19 patient has been shared as a true event.", "lang": "en"}
