Since then, several media outlets have reported that Bhagwat said, \u201cAvoid using the word \u2018nationalism\u2019, as it is derived from Hitler or Nazi.\u201d\n\nThe report was first published by ANI (archive link) which was later picked up by The Quint (archive link), NDTV (archive link) and Economic Times (archive link). Times of India (archive link) attributes the report to Press Trust of India (PTI), while The Hindu (archive link) sourced the report from PTI and IANS.\n\nNDTV also covered Bhagwat\u2019s speech on TV claiming that he said nationalism implies nazism.\n\nSimilarly, several Twitter accounts also shared the viral claim.\n\nAlt News performed a keyword search on YouTube and found Bhagwat\u2019s full speech uploaded by VSK JHARKHAND in two parts (part 1, part 2) on February 19. At 4:00 in the first part, Bhagwat begins to speak about nationalism. Prior to this segment, he spoke about the policies by RSS and how they are linked with India\u2019s growth.\n\nAt 4:30 mark, Bhagwat shared his experience from his trip to the United Kingdom. He said, \u201cSome years back, I visited the UK because of RSS\u2019s work and spoke to intellectuals there. I had a discussion with 40-50 people from the city about the RSS. One of our workers from the UK told me to be cautious while using English words since it is not our mother tongue.\u201d In the next part, Bhagwat quotes the worker in direct speech \u2013 \u201cYou will use the word as per the books you have read. But while speaking, the meaning is often lost. That\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t use the word nationalism.\u201d\n\nAt 5:17 mark, Bhagwat continues to directly quote the worker, \u201cIf you say nation, it\u2019s fine. If you say national, it is fine. Even nationality is fine. But don\u2019t use the word nationalism because nationalism has roots in Hitler, nazism, and fascism. The word has got a bad reputation there. But we know that as a nation whenever India has grown, the world has benefited.\u201d\n\nRajiv Tuli, state executive member RSS-Delhi, spoke with Alt News and said, \u201cMohan Bhagwat ji was sharing an anecdote from this trip to the UK. Media organisations have misquoted him.\u201d\n\nRSS chief Mohan Bhagwat was, therefore, quoting an RSS worker he claimed to have met in the UK. The words were not his but stated by the worker.", "lang": "en"}
