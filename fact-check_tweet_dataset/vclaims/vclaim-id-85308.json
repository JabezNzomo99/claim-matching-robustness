Mantri used the hashtag #PositiveNews.\n\nHad the ones who shared the Inshorts link bothered to open it, this is what they\u2019d have read, \u201cThe US has classified India as a developed nation, eliminating the preferential treatment it received in countervailing duty investigations. This makes it easier for the US to penalise India if it harms US industries with unfairly subsidised exports.\u201d\n\nThe title of the report (or whatever is the acceptable term for 60-word \u2018crisp\u2019 news) was undoubtedly misleading, taking away the nuance from news. Inshorts sourced its piece from The Print where the headline doesn\u2019t distort the context of the news. For the sake of brevity, not only did Inshorts remove China\u2019s reference but also the phrase \u2018trade benefits\u2019.\n\nClassification as a \u2018developed nation\u2019 by the US is not an indicator of progress\n\nThe revocation of India\u2019s developing country status does not mean we have moved up the development ladder but it defines India\u2019s future trade relationship with the US. The reclassification does not indicate a rise in Gross National Income (GNI) or other social development indicators such as healthcare and education.\n\nWhat does the classification mean?\n\nThe United States used to group India in the category of developing nations. However, at the behest of president Donald Trump, the member countries were shuffled. Trump \u2018explained\u2019 why in a tweet last year: \u201c\u2026so that countries stop CHEATING the system at the expense of the USA!\u201d\n\nTrump wrote that the World Trade Organisation (WTO) is broken thus allowing some of the \u2018richest\u2019 countries in the world that claim to be developing nations to get special treatment. India, as per Trump, was one such country.\n\nThe WTO allows countries to self-declare as developing nations (or developed/ least-developed countries). India is one of the WTO\u2019s Asian developing members. The self-declaration however can be challenged by member states. The developing country status gives members certain benefits such as the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) followed by the US. According to the United States Trade Representatives (USTR), \u201cGSP provides opportunities for many of the world\u2019s poorest countries to use trade to grow their economies and climb out of poverty.\u201d\n\nUnder the GSP, Indian exporters received tariff-free access to the US until June 2019, when all benefits were suspended. Trump had signed an executive order in November 2018 that ended duty-free status for 50 items. Finance minister Piyush Goyal had sought for complete restoration of GSP benefits. As per Business Standard, \u201cIndia was the largest beneficiary nation under the GSP, with total benefits from tariff exemptions amounting to $260 million in 2018, according to the data from the USTR\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nIndia was eligible for the 2% de minimus standard under the WTO rules which required countervailing duty (CVD) investigators to \u201cterminate duty investigation if the amount of subsidy is less than 2% ad valorem (proportion to the estimated value of goods),\u201d according to Bloomberg.\n\nCVDs are trade import duties imposed under the WTO rules to counter the negative impact of subsidies. As duty investigations for India will now be conducted, it would be easier for the US to penalise the country if it harms US industries with \u2018unfairly\u2019 subsidised exports.\n\nNew Delhi and Washington, DC are reportedly negotiating a trade deal which is likely to be signed during Trump\u2019s visit to India later this month.\n\nThe USTR, for the purpose of reclassification, has not considered countries that did not declare themselves as developing nations at the time of accession to the WTO. It has also not taken into account \u201csocial development indicators such as infant mortality rates, adult illiteracy rates, and life expectancy at birth, as a basis for changing a designation.\u201d\n\nThe US said that the following countries should forgo special treatment:\n\n1. WTO members with a per capita GNI above $12,375 as per World Bank data.\n\n2. WTO members that account for no less than 0.5% of the global trade share.\n\n3. Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) membership or application for membership, European Union (EU) membership, and Group of Twenty (G20) membership.\n\nThe Trump administration ended the differential treatment for so-called developing nations, including India, giving the following reason: \u201cFor purposes of U.S. CVD law, the USTR considers countries with a share of 0.5% or more of world trade to be developed countries. Thus, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Viet Nam are ineligible for the 2% de minimis standard, notwithstanding that, based on the most recent World Bank data, each country has a per capita GNI below $12,375.\u201d The USTR also stated that India\u2019s membership to the G20 bloc makes it ineligible for benefits.\n\n\u201cAs of 2017, India\u2019s share in global trade was 2.1% for exports and 2.6% for imports,\u201d reports Business Standard.\n\nIn short, the US has revoked India\u2019s developing nation status, notwithstanding that India\u2019s per capita GNI is below $12,375, because the country\u2019s world trade share is more than 0.5% and it is a member of G20 bloc. India is classified as a lower-middle-income economy by the World Bank.\n\nHow does the revocation of developing nation status impact India?\n\nThe removal of India from the US\u2019s internal list of developing nations can negatively impact Indian trade. In a conversation with Alt News, Dr Biswajit Dhar explained the implications. Dhar is a professor at Centre for Economic Studies and Planning at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). He was formerly the head of Centre for WTO Studies at Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT).\n\n\u201cThis [the classification of India as a developing nation] is important in the larger context of our membership with the WTO. Because unlike in the World Bank which uses income criteria, the WTO follows self-declaration. So as long as India calls itself as a developing country, it is going to be treated as a developing country and as a developing country, there are lots of additional benefits that accrue to a country. For example, they can maintain higher import tariffs. Many developed countries give us the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) under which the tariffs imposed on us, or other developing countries, are lower than those on developed countries. Last year the US took us off the list which means that our products will attract the same amount of tariffs as other developed countries. Given our problems, market access in the US becomes a little more difficult now. If we are recognised as a developed country, the leeway that we have to use or impose tariffs will lessen in the years to come,\u201d said Dr Dhar.\n\n\u201cIndia is a unique economy. A part of the country seems like a developed country, but a large part of the nation looks less developed. As a country with one of the largest numbers of poor and undernourished in the world, this part will fall in the category of least developed countries. My view is that there are significant development deficits in India and given those deficits, we need to have flexibility in terms of trade policies,\u201d he furthered.\n\n\u201cAt our stage of development, any attack on our status as a developing country will have a serious impact on our development,\u201d said Dr Dhar, elaborating how the reclassification will impact Indian agriculture: \u201cBecause of the WTO, we get more subsidies than developed countries, and this includes agricultural subsidies. If tomorrow, we are designated as a developed country, immediately our subsidies will be halved, if not more. So there will be serious implications on farmers. There is some discussion going on that these subsidies should be cut and there should be direct transfer but the ability of the government to give subsidies to farmers will be severely restricted.\u201d\n\nIt may be reiterated that the classification of India as a developed nation, from the earlier developing country status, is not a result of achieving a milestone in development. As a matter of fact, the revocation is likely to have a negative effect on Indian trade in terms of subsidies and access to the US market. It is noteworthy that the revocation is not limited to India, but a plethora of other countries.", "lang": "en"}
