He then goes on to blame seculars and intellectuals for illegal Rohingya Muslim infiltration. He wrote, \u201c\u2026.Myanmar to India- 1769 kms \u2026.Myanmar to China.- 2km But, Why the Rohingyas want to come to India? and not China? Because Unlike India, there are no seculars no Intellectuals no anti nationals no in China, who support refugees Rohingyas.\u201d This post was retweeted close to 12,000 times and liked over 35,000 times.\n\nSimilarly, on December 17, founder of fake news platform Postcard News Mahesh Vikram Hegde who is \u2018blessed to be followed by PM Narendra Modi,\u2019 posted the same message along with an infographic that takes West Bengal as the point of entry from Myanmar to India. Several other users have posted the same claim on Twitter and Facebook.\n\n\n\nJust like how Myanmar shares a border with China, it also shares its border with four Indian states \u2013 Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Mizoram, and Manipur. In fact, all three nations share borders.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Home Affairs, the total length of the international border between Myanmar and India is 1,643 kilometres (km).\n\nA press release by Press Information Bureau from January 3, 2018, reported an agreement signed between India and Myanmar on Land Border Crossing. The objective of the agreement was to facilitate regulation and harmonization of already existing free movement rights for people ordinarily residing in the border areas of both countries, along with the basis of valid passports and visas.\n\nThe claim made by Paresh Rawal and others that distance between Myanmar to China is 2 km and Myanmar to India is 1769 km is irrational and false. The former BJP MP has been featured on Alt News fact-checks several times in the past \u2013 for tweeting a fake newspaper clipping targetting Rahul Gandhi and for putting out false statistics to portray Modi government better at combating terror in J&K.", "lang": "en"}
