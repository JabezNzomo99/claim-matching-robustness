In an oddity created by the new boundaries, two of the primary candidates are incumbents now fighting for the same seat.\n\nThroughout the debate, Rep. George Holding attempted to paint himself as a staunch conservative who won\u2019t budge on controversial issues. Rep. Renee Ellmers attempted to paint herself as a more pragmatic conservative who would rather get things done.\n\nThat fight was perhaps most apparent in a back-and-forth on immigration policy. Holding accused Ellmers of being too liberal in a 2015 vote.\n\n\"We had an amendment to prioritize the deportation of sexual criminals who are illegal immigrants,\" Holding said. \"Mrs. Ellmers was the only Republican to vote against that amendment.\"\n\nIt\u2019s true that Ellmers was the only Republican to vote no on that particular amendment, which was tacked onto a bill regarding Department of Homeland Security funding. She was also one of 10 Republicans who voted against the bill as a whole .\n\nHowever, the amendment in question did more than just prioritize the deportation of dangerous sexual criminals. It also would\u2019ve prioritized people convicted of domestic violence or less serious, misdemeanor sexual crimes.\n\nAnd it was because of fears over unintended consequences of those extra provisions \u2013 which Holding neglected to mention \u2013 that Ellmers has long said she voted no.\n\nImmediately after the 2015 vote, Ellmers said in an interview with McClatchy\u2019s D.C. bureau that she opposed it because it \"may remove protections for victims of sexual assault or domestic abuse.\"\n\nThat was the same stance taken by the and the .\n\nBoth groups urged a \u2018No\u2019 vote, saying the amendment would lead to domestic and sexual violence going unreported.\n\n\"Victims of domestic violence often do not seek help when they know that the consequences to the perpetrator (for example, a spouse or parent, or perhaps other family member) may result in the perpetrator\u2019s deportation,\" the task force wrote to members of Congress. \"This often takes place due to their financial dependence, and even close relationship to the perpetrator.\"\n\nThe bishops agreed, writing: \"While presented as a measure that helps domestic violence victims, we fear that it actually would discourage many such victims from reporting abuse.\"\n\nThe amendment and the bill as a whole passed the House despite that opposition. But the amendment in question was removed by the Senate, which passed the bill and sent the new version back to the House, which approved it even though it didn\u2019t include the amendment. President Obama then signed the bill into law.\n\nThat chain of events led Ellmers, during the recent debate, to shoot back at Holding.\n\n\"That amendment was completely meaningless, and you know it was,\" she said.\n\nAnd even though Holding brought up sexual criminals, the amendment would have changed nothing for the most egregious offenders. Undocumented immigrants who commit felonies \u2013 including serious sexual crimes like rape \u2013 were already given top priority for deportation.\n\nEllmers referenced that in the debate: \"As far as deporting those who are the worst offenders \u2013 those illegal immigrants who are pedophiles \u2013 my goodness, are we not doing that now?\"\n\nIt was a rhetorical question. But according to the government, we are indeed doing just that.\n\nIn 2014, the Department of Homeland Security listed its highest priorities for deportation: convicted of a felony, convicted of gang-related crimes, caught at the border or suspected of being a terrorist or spy.\n\nAn Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) report on the 2015 fiscal year said 98 percent of the 235,413 people deported that year met one of its criteria or were otherwise considered a threat to public safety.\n\nAt the debate, Ellmers also said she voted no because she thought Republicans should have worked with Democrats to find a compromise instead of letting President Obama set the country\u2019s immigration policy while Congress remains in a boondoggle.\n\n\"I find it interesting that we are still in a place where we are having this conversation about what we are not getting done,\" Ellmers said.\n\nHolding said Ellmers was the only Republican to vote against \"an amendment to prioritize the deportation of sexual criminals who are illegal immigrants.\"\n\nHolding was correct about Ellmers\u2019 conspicuous break from party ranks. But his description of the amendment was a bit misleading, since anyone convicted of a felony for a sex crime was already prioritized for deportation.\n\nEllmers has also long said she voted against the bill due to fears that it would lead to less reporting of domestic violence. That\u2019s a key piece of context that was missing from Holding\u2019s assessment of her record.", "lang": "en"}
