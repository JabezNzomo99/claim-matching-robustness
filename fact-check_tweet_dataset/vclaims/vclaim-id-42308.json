Using the snipping tool \u2013 you can use any screen capture app \u2013 Africa Check cut the image in three and uploaded them separately to\n\nto see if there was an original photo for each.\n\nAs it turns out, all three have been photoshopped into one image.\n\n, the base photograph for the montage is an image of Morrison, taken by Gloria Stavers, then editor-in-chief of 16 magazine, in the late 1960s.\n\nThe image of Lee was snapped in 1972 as part of\n\n, Hong Kong\u2019s first US-style mall.
