Churchill died in 1965.\n\nChurchill experts also cast doubt on the veracity of the attribution.\n\n\u201cThis \u2018quote\u2019 is widely found online but there is no documented evidence that Churchill ever said it,\u201d Lee Pollock, trustee and adviser to the board of the International Churchill Society, told us in an email. \u201cIt does not appear in any of his many books, articles or speeches nor is there any attribution from a witness that he/she heard him say that.\u201d\n\nLikewise, a senior fellow at Hillsdale College\u2019s Churchill Project, Richard M. Langworth, includes the quotation in a post titled \u201cAll the \u2018Quotes\u2019 Winston Churchill Never Said.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
