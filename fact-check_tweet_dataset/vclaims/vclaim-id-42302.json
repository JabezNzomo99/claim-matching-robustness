This article is a fact check of these claims.\n\nWhat is the PMKSY?\n\n The first claim is that \u2018PMKSY launched to modernize supply chain infrastructure.\u2019\n\nPMKSY stands for the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana. The website of the scheme states that \u2018Government of India (GOI) has approved a new Central Sector Scheme \u2013 Pradhan Mantri Kisan SAMPADA Yojana (Scheme for Agro-Marine Processing and Development of Agro-Processing Clusters) with an allocation of Rs.. 6,000 crore for the period 2016-20 coterminous with the 14th Finance Commission cycle. The scheme will be implemented by Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI). The scheme was approved in May 2017. The following schemes will be implemented under PM Kisan SAMPADA Yojana:\n\nAnother response in the Lok Sabha in January 2019 predicts that \u2018PMKSY is expected to leverage investment of Rs.31,400 crore, handling of 334 lakh MT of agro-produce valuing Rs. 1.04 lakh crore, will benefit 20 lakh farmers and generate 5.3 lakh direct/ indirect employment in the country by the year 2019-20\u2019. The progress up to March 2018 is as follows:\n\nWhile the scheme itself is new and has been launched under the BJP government, it is of interest to note that under the UPA government also, \u2018Ministry of Food Processing Industries provided assistance for development of integrated cold chain and preservation of infrastructure facilities from farm gate to the consumer.\u2019 Most of the components under the PMKSY were already under implementation and have received grants and funding much before the BJP government (2006 in some cases).\n\nDid budget allocation for food processing industry double?\n\n The second claim is that \u2018budget allocation doubled to push food processing industry\u2019.\n\nThe claim does not specify the years of comparison. Hence it is difficult to verify the claim. However, the actual expenditure under the Ministry of Food Processing Industries has not followed a particular trend. It has increased & decreased both during the UPA as well as the NDA. If the actual expenditure in 2014-15 is taken as the base, then the revised estimate for 2018-19 is about 70% more than the 2014-15 figure, but not exactly double.\n\nFact: The claim does not specify the years of comparison. Hence it is difficult to verify the claim. However, the actual expenditure under the Ministry of Food Processing Industries has not followed a particular trend. It has increased & decreased both during the UPA as well as the NDA. If the actual expenditure in 2014-15 is taken as the base, then the revised estimate for 2018-19 is about 70% more than the 2014-15 figure, but not exactly double. Hence the claim remains UNVERIFIED.\n\nWhat are GrAMs?\n\n The third claim is that \u2018GrAMs, electronically linked to e-NAM, to make direct sale to consumers and bulk purchasers\u2019.\n\nA response in Lok Sabha in February 2019 stated that \u2018in the Union Budget 2018-19, Government has announced upgradation and development of existing 22,000 village haats to Gramin Agriculture Market (GrAMs) through convergence of various schemes such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) and others. The GrAMs are to be exempted from Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) regulations and linked to e-NAM. These GrAMs are intended to facilitate farmers in selling their produce to direct buyers\u2019.\n\nIt has to be noted that the village haats were in existence from long before the BJP government came into power but their up-gradation and linking to the electronic market is an innovation.\n\nWhat is Operation Greens?\n\n The fourth claim is that \u2018Operation Greens to address price volatility of perishable commodities like tomato, onion and potato\u2019.\n\nPress Information bureau published in February 2018 that \u2018taking Government\u2019s vision ahead, the Finance Minister, in Budget 2018-19, announced the launching of \u2018Operation Greens\u2019 to address price volatility of perishable commodities like potatoes, tomatoes and onions, at an outlay of Rs. 500 crores. \u2018Operation Greens\u2019, on the lines of \u2018Operation Flood\u2019, shall promote Farmer Producers Organizations (FPOs), agri-logistics, processing facilities and professional management in the sector\u2019.\n\nThe scheme has since been launched for Tomato, Onion and Potato (TOP) value chain with a budgetary allocation of Rs. 500 crores spread over 2018-19 and 2019-20 with allocation of Rs. 200 crores and Rs. 300 crores respectively.\n\nAre 22,000 rural haats being developed into GrAMs?\n\n The fifth claim is that \u2018existing 22,000 rural haats are being developed into Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs), helping 86% small farmers\u2019.\n\nAccording to a response in the Lok Sabha, the total number of rural haats in the country is 22711, majority of which are under local institutions of Panchayati Raj of States. Details about how many small farmers are going to benefit from this scheme are not available in the public domain.\n\nThis story is part of a larger series on the 4-years of the Modi government.
