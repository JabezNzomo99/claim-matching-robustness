(Media reports often get around this uncomfortable fact by often calling it \u201cthe latest data.\u201d) The number is derived from data collected between 1997 and 1999, mainly from a telephone survey in 1999 of 16,111 adult caregivers and 5,015 youths. The results were then weighted based on U.S. Census data.\n\nIn other words, these numbers come from an era that predates the wide use of mobile phones, which allow parents to keep much closer track of their children, or the creation of the Amber alerts (which are also on phones, in Facebook news feeds and so forth). There is an update in the works, but the results will not be released until sometime later this year.\n\nSo, first off, you see this is an estimate, based on a survey, not based on actual incidents. NBC News claimed this was FBI data, which makes it sound like real crimes, but instead this was simply derived from a study conducted by academicians for the Justice Department.\n\nDavid Finkelhor, a University of New Hampshire professor who is director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center and a key author of the study, readily said that the media frequently misunderstand and misreport this figure. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is a reliable estimate, and I don\u2019t use it very much,\u201d he said. \u201cI am really not crazy about any of these numbers.\u201d\n\nThe DOJ reports provide ample warning that the data should be handled with care, though sometimes you have to look hard at the footnotes. Two key components of the 58,000 figure are children who are reported missing by their caretakers or children who were missed by the caretaker for at least an hour but no report was filed. (Note: The \u201creporting missing\u201d number is a subset of the \u201ccaretaker missing\u201d figure.)\n\nBut the report warns that \u201cboth of these numerical estimates are quite imprecise and could actually be quite a bit smaller or larger because they are based on very small numbers of cases.\u201d One of the footnotes is emphatic: \u201cEstimate is based on an extremely small sample of cases; therefore, its precision and confidence interval are unreliable.\u201d\n\nAs an example, the number of children reported missing is estimated at 12,100 \u2014 but the possible range (within a 95 percent confidence interval) is between less than 100 and 31,000. Similarly, the number of children whom a caretaker missed at some point is estimated at 33,000, with a possible range of 2,000 to 64,000.\n\nFinally, the overall figure of 58,000 also includes children whom the caretaker did not miss at all. The report gives numerous examples: a 17-year-old girl on a date who was detained by force and sexually assaulted; a 15-year-old lured into a school bathroom and assaulted; a 17-year-old detained and assaulted in a parking lot at a high school football game. Either the children did not tell their caregivers, or they did and the caregivers never filed a report, sometimes because they saw no injury or did not believe the child.\n\nHere, the range is 24,100 to 92,400. The difference from the two earlier ranges is mostly a function of the sample size, Finkelhor said. \u201cThere is not much we can say about these figures with precision,\u201d he said.\n\nThese incidents may meet a legal definition of \u201cabduction\u201d but generally do not conform to the public\u2019s understanding of an abduction, as many also might be considered assault. In news reports, the number is often cited in conjunction with a very distinct crime of kidnapping. (The ABC News report, for instance, was pegged to the case of an 8-year-old who was killed by a stranger after getting lost on the way home from camp.)\n\nIn an effort to highlight the distinction, Finelhor said the report included an estimate for the number of \u201cstereotypical kidnapping victims\u201d in a year. (Such crimes are \u201cabductions perpetrated by a stranger or slight acquaintance and involving a child who was transported 50 or more miles, detained overnight, held for ransom or with the intent to keep the child permanently, or killed.\u201d)\n\nThe DOJ studies, as written, are fairly clear about the limitations of the data, though perhaps the update, when it is released in 2015, could more clearly highlight the caveats in bold type. Sometimes reporters need to be hit over the head with a two-by-four.", "lang": "en"}
