The claim is false; the women are singing a Hindu song, but they are at an ashram in southern India, not a Dubai mosque.\n\nMultiple Facebook posts including this one, which has been viewed more than 160,000 times and shared more than 11,000 times since it was published on November 9, 2018, contain a 4 min 13 sec video.\n\nThe clip shows a group of women in black headscarves playing instruments and singing a religious song whose words mention the Hindu god Ram.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption says, in Hindi: \u201cMuslim women in Dubai sang Hindu religious songs inside a mosque and their sheikh husbands clapped their efforts and participated with them.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe video with the same caption has been shared elsewhere on Facebook, for example here and here, on Twitter here and on YouTube here.\n\nA reverse image search found that the original video was shot on July 10, 2012 in the southern Indian village of Puttaparthi, at the ashram of an influential Hindu guru called Sathya Sai Baba, who died in 2011.\n\nHere is the spiritual leader\u2019s website and here is an AFP report on his death.\n\nThe clip in the misleading post appears from 43:58 in a longer YouTube video published here on Radiosai.org, the website of Sathya Sai Baba\u2019s official media channel.\n\nBelow is the full video of the performance:\n\nThe original video contains a title that says, in English: \u201cSarva Dharma Swarupa Sai. Music concert by the pilgrims from MIDDLE EAST & GULF. 10 July 2012\u201d.\n\nBoth the misleading clip and the original video have a white watermark in the bottom-left corner which says: \u201cradiosai.org\u201d.\n\nBelow is an image comparing screenshots of the misleading Facebook post (L) with the original video (R):\n\nThe original video\u2019s caption on Radio Sai\u2019s YouTube channel says, in part: \u201cDevotees from Bahrain, Iran, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey and United Arab Emirates, provided an Arabic flavour in Prasanthi Nilayam\u201d.\n\nPrasanthi Nilayam refers to the ashram in Puttaparthi, located here on Google Maps.\n\nAFP published images from the same ashram in Puttaparthi at Sathya Sai Baba\u2019s funeral in April 2011, for example here and here on AFP\u2019s image forum site.\n\nBy analysing multiple AFP images from different angles, architectural features can be identified that match the misleading video.\n\nExamples of these features include the golden chandeliers, a square pattern on the ceiling, the pink decorative top of the columns and the translucent awning on the side of the hall.\n\nThese similarities are highlighted in the image below, which compares screenshots from the misleading video (L) with AFP images (R):\n\nA news website run by Sathya Sai Baba\u2019s ashram also reported here that a group from the Middle East and Gulf visited the site and played a concert on July 10, 2012.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the report:", "lang": "en"}
