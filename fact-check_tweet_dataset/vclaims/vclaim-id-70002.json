His sweeping assertion assumes at least three things to be true.\n\u2022 Kenosha was on a trajectory for destruction.\n\u2022 No other changes happened that would have improved the Kenosha situation.\n\u2022 He alone is responsible for activating the National Guard.\n\nEach of these is wrong. Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nThis is the most obvious hyperbole in Trump\u2019s tweet. (It's also a claim he repeated even more strongly the next day, saying during a Sept. 1 roundtable with Kenosha leaders, \"I come into an area like this and I see the town is burned down.\")\n\nThe events in Kenosha have been tragic and shocking. But there\u2019s a big difference between protests damaging a limited area and destroying or altering a large portion of a city of 100,000 people.\n\nThe protests, even at the peak of the unrest Aug. 25, were largely concentrated in the 1-acre Civic Park and a nearby area a few blocks wide. Though people spilled into nearby neighborhoods after the largest groups were dispersed.\n\nThat drastically exaggerates the scope of the situation in Kenosha, a city of 28.4 square miles, even at its worst.\n\nMany factors in reduction of violence\n\nTrump\u2019s attempt to claim credit assumes the National Guard presence was the only factor in the lack of violence after the Rittenhouse shooting. There are many reasons that\u2019s wrong.\n\nThe simple makeup of the crowd changed.\n\nA group described by Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth as \"a militia\" and \"vigilante group\" had been patrolling the streets of Kenosha and even standing watch on roofs with long guns the first couple nights after the Blake shooting. On Tuesday, in the hours before the shooting, the \"Kenosha Guard\" issued a call on Facebook for \"patriots willing to take up arms and defend out (sic) City tonight from the evil thugs.\"\n\nThat page was removed by Facebook after the Rittenhouse shooting, and the presence of people wearing military gear and openly carrying weapons dropped drastically after the night of chaos that included the shooting, according to Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporters who have been on the ground in Kenosha \u2014 though citizens with handguns were observed as late as the weekend.\n\nDuring the height of the protests, the vigilante groups and Black Lives Matter protesters were regularly clashing with each other, by hurling insults or worse. Removing half of that equation \u2014 for whatever reason that occurred \u2014 changed the situation dramatically.\n\nThere have also been calls for peace from all corners, including Blake\u2019s family, at marches and rallies, and \u2014 to varying degrees \u2014 from Gov. Tony Evers and local officials.\n\nIn addition, Evers has declared a state of emergency, and local officials have taken steps such as closing off freeway access to better control the area \u2014 beyond simply increasing the number of troops (which has also happened).\n\n\"The last five days have been closer to normal for Kenosha,\" Beth said at an Aug. 31 news conference. \"And really if you go outside a few block area in Kenosha, life has been just like it has been all the time.\"\n\nAll of which brings us to the most fundamental claim here \u2014 that Trump dispatched the National Guard.\n\nAnd even that isn\u2019t true.\n\nThe White House described itself as authorizing 2,000 National Guard troops to go to Kenosha. But Maj. Gen. Paul Knapp, who commands the Wisconsin National Guard, said that\u2019s not really how that system operates.\n\nHe described it this way when asked Aug. 31 what role the White House has played in the Kenosha response.\n\n\"What I want to re-emphasize is the process is actually a governor-to-governor compact,\" Knapp said. \"Through the (Emergency Management Assistance Compact) process we had already started talking to other states (when the White House got involved), it\u2019s one of the things we do right away during something like this.\"\n\nThe White House press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment early on Sept. 1.\n\nEach state has its own National Guard \u2014 as provided for in the Constitution \u2014 and the guard has a role at both the state and federal level, according to its website. Governors can call the National Guard into action during local or statewide emergencies, and the president can activate the guard for federal missions.\n\nExamples of federal missions given on the website included deployments to Kosovo or the anti-terrorism efforts in the Middle East.\n\nBut all National Guard members working in Kenosha have been mobilized by Evers or governors in Michigan, Arizona and Alaska as part of the inter-state agreements. They are commanded by Knapp and remain under state control.\n\nThe Kenosha effort has not been federalized, said Evers spokeswoman Britt Cudaback.\n\nIn other words, none of the National Guard troops now in Wisconsin have been dispatched or authorized by Trump. And the state-run efforts to bring troops were underway a full day before Trump first had contact with Wisconsin officials.\n\n\"The governor had already activated the Wisconsin National Guard to respond in Kenosha and doubled their presence before Trump or his Administration offered federal support,\" Cudaback said.\n\nThe timeline of events in Kenosha makes this crystal clear.\n\nHere are key moments in the Kenosha unrest and the law enforcement response, as detailed by Evers\u2019 office and media reports. Times of key events are provided where relevant.\n\u2022 3:05 a.m. \u2014 Kenosha County requests a National Guard Quick Reaction Force, a team trained to deploy anywhere in the state within 12 hours. Evers then formally endorses that request.\n\u2022 The National Guard provides 125 troops \u2014 the full number who are part of that team.\n\u2022 2:33 p.m. \u2014 Evers\u2019 office sends a bulletin declaring a state of emergency and increasing the National Guard support from 125 to 250.\n\u2022 2:45 p.m. \u2014 The Trump administration speaks to Evers (first Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, then Trump himself). Evers ultimately declines offers of federal help.\n\u2022 7:16 p.m. \u2014 Trump tweets implying the National Guard was not in Wisconsin \u2014 \"Governor should call in the National Guard in Wisconsin. \u2026 End problem FAST!\" \u2014 though the guard at this point had already been on the ground for more than a day.\n\u2022 11:45 p.m. \u2014 Police say Rittenhouse opens fire on protesters, killing two and injuring a third.\n\u2022 Wisconsin began coordinating with other states about obtaining additional National Guard resources and support.\n\u2022 The Wisconsin State Patrol provides more than 70 officers.\n\u2022 Neighboring jurisdictions are still providing more than 100 law enforcement officers.\n\u2022 11 a.m. \u2014 Meadows talks to Evers again, with federal authorities ultimately sending FBI and U.S. Marshal support to the area later in the day. Cudaback said as of Aug. 31 this remained the only federal government assistance provided.\n\u2022 The Wisconsin National Guard is now providing 500 troops.\n\u2022 Neighboring jurisdictions are still providing more than 100 law enforcement officers.\n\u2022 The Wisconsin State Patrol is now providing 80 officers.\n\u2022 1:30 p.m. \u2014 Evers enters an agreement with other states to provide National Guard help as part of the Emergency Management Assistance Compact.\n\u2022 The Wisconsin National Guard is now providing 750 troops.\n\u2022 12:01 p.m. \u2014 Trump tweets, \"Success: Since the National Guard moved into Kenosha, Wisconsin, two days ago, there has been NO FURTHER VIOLENCE, not even a small problem.\" The National Guard had actually been deployed in Wisconsin for four days at this point, not two.\n\u2022 The Wisconsin National Guard is now providing 1,000 troops.\n\u2022 Arizona, Alabama and Michigan National Guard troops arrive, accounting for at least 500 more guardsman (total of 1,500). All of these troops are under Knapp\u2019s command.\n\nKnapp said Aug. 31 that those 1,500 National Guard troops remained deployed in Kenosha. The guard members do not make arrests, but \"fulfill roles that allows those (local) law enforcement officers to be freed up\" to more active work in the streets, he said.\n\nWe should also note Trump was taking steps before and after this claim that served more to increase division than limit it. On Aug. 30, Sunday night, he liked a tweet that said \"Rittenhouse is a good example of why I decided to vote for Trump.\" Rittenhouse is a Trump supporter.\n\nThe next day, at a White house briefing, Trump asserted Rittenhouse was \"trying to get away\" and was \"violently attacked\" before opening fire \u2014 a description that ignores the fact Rittenhouse had already allegedly shot and killed a man prior to that point.\n\nTrump made a similar claim while visiting Kenosha Sept. 1, saying, \"Violence has stopped since the time the National Guard came \u2014 literally when they set their foot on this location it stopped.\"\n\nThe timeline shows this is clearly wrong. The National Guard had been in Kenosha for more than a day when the Rittenhouse shooting occured.\n\nTrump said on Twitter, \"If I didn\u2019t INSIST on having the National Guard activate and go into Kenosha, Wisconsin, there would be no Kenosha right now.\"\n\nIt\u2019s a vast exaggeration to say the situation in Kenosha was so dire as to threaten its very existence. And many other factors played a role in the reduced violence in the days before Trump\u2019s tweet.\n\nBut the most fundamental element of this claim is also completely wrong. National Guard troops were en route and even on the ground well before the Trump administration got involved.\n\nThe National Guard troops ultimately sent were deployed in Wisconsin by Evers and Knapp or sent from other states as part of agreements entered into by the states\u2019 governors.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
