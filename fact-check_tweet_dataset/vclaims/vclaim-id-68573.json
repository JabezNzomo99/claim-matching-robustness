Soon, it turned into a meme when text was overlaid across it with the words \"Clemson QB speaks out to defend America.\"\n\nA quote attributed to Lawrence follows: \"President Trump got all our favorite foods, it was the best meal we ever had. Then we go and see the coastal elite media trashing it for not being organic vegan. We\u2019re football players not bloggers. This was a perfect blue collar party.\"\n\nWe can\u2019t determine where the meme originated from but it has been shared widely on social media.\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nNo, the 19-year-old college quarterback did not say the party was trashed by \"the coastal elite media for not being organic vegan.\" Nor did he say it was \"a perfect blue collar party.\"\n\nThe entire quote was fabricated.\n\nAfter the post started to gain traction, Lawrence came out and denounced the quote, tweeting, \"I never said this by the way \u2026 I don\u2019t know where it came from. However the trip to the White House was awesome!\"\n\nLawrence\u2019s tweet shared the fake quote from @CloydRivers, an account with 1.8 million followers that routinely shares misinformation. That tweet has since been removed from the platform.\n\nRoss Taylor, assistant athletic director for Clemson football communications, told the Associated Press that Lawrence was shown the false quote on Tuesday.\n\n\"Everything that is presented in the meme is fabricated,\" Taylor said.\n\nThis quote is Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
