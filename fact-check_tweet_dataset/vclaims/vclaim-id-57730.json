WTH??\u201d\n\nThe post has been shared more than 500 times, received more than 170 comments and had more than 80 interactions.\n\nInfluenza is most common in Australia between April and October \u2013 the so-called \u201cflu season\u201d \u2013 and health authorities recommend an annual vaccination against the viral disease.\n\nFlu shots are made available for free under the National Immunisation Program to people classified as more vulnerable to suffering severe illness as a result of the flu.\n\nWhile people are encouraged to have flu shots, they are not mandatory for the general public.\n\nIn the current COVID-19 pandemic, flu shots have been made mandatory for workers and visitors to Australian aged care facilities. The federal Minister for Aged Care stated the requirement was put in place to protect the aged care workforce and aged care residents who, being older people are particularly at risk of serious illness from the flu.\n\nThe post claims that \u201ca lady who works for Woolworths\u201d informed the person posting that all Woolworths employees must have a flu shot before May 1 \u201cor they will no longer be employed there!!!\u201d.\n\nWoolworths is a supermarket group with 995 stores in Australia.\n\nA Woolworths spokesperson told AAP FactCheck in an email that while Woolworths employees have access to an annual flu vaccination through the company, having the shot is not mandatory and a person\u2019s employment at the company is not affected by whether they have been vaccinated.\n\n\u201cWoolworths offers its employees free access to an annual flu vaccination through our internal health and wellbeing programs,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cWhile we encourage employees to take up this offer, it is in no way compulsory and would never result in termination of employment or any punitive measures against a team member.\u201d\n\nA union representing retail workers, the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA) said there was no evidence of Woolworths employees being required to have a vaccine.\n\n\u201cAs far as the SDA is able to ascertain it has no evidence of mandatory flu vaccinations being required in Woolworths establishments,\u201d a spokesman for the union told AAP FactCheck.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claims in the Facebook post to be false. Woolworths employees are not required to get vaccinated against the flu in order to work at or for the supermarket chain.
