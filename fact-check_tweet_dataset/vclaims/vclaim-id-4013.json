It\u2019s as fictional as it sounds.\n\nThe story, rightfully flagged by Facebook users as potentially false, appeared on americanewsupdates.me on April 12 and on newsfeedusa.us on April 14.\n\nThe dubious story, which has no named author, claims the former president\u2019s security outfit is called \u201cNOS United\u201d and that \u201c\u2018NOS\u2019 stands for \u2018Novus Ordo Seclorum,\u2019 or New World Order.\u201d That Latin phrase, which can be translated as \u201cnew order of the ages,\u201d actually appears on the reverse side of the Great Seal of the United States that is printed on the back of the dollar bill. (We previously debunked claims that Obama had called for a \u201cnew world order.\u201d)\n\nWe also did a search of business records in Washington, D.C., New York and California and could find no record of an \u201cNOS United.\u201d The story claimed that \u201calong with two small islands due east of Virginia just in international waters, Obama\u2019s \u2018team\u2019 has now set up massive complexes with billions in equipment and spying technology outside of Washington DC, New York and Los Angeles.\u201d\n\nWe also found no matches for that company when searching Illinois Secretary of State business records. The Obamas currently live in D.C., but still have a house in Chicago.\n\nIn fact, the closest we came to finding anything by the name of \u201cNOS United\u201d is an electronic \u201ctube\u201d called the \u201cNOS United 845.\u201d\n\nThe story goes on to present wild claims, such as the idea of a \u201cpopulation reduction plan,\u201d in which \u201cTrump supporters will be the first ones buried in mass graves.\u201d But it doesn\u2019t cite any sources for that information.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201cNYS Divisions of Corporations, State Records and UCC.\u201d New York State.
