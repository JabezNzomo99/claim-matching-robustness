He said COVID-19 really means \u201ccertification of vaccination identity,\u201d and questioned why many people recover from the disease despite having no vaccine yet.\n\nWhile there is an existing video of Gates talking about virus outbreaks in a TED Talk in 2015, he never mentioned COVID-19 in his speech. Instead, he was urging the people to prepare for the next possible epidemic and suggested putting resources into scenario planning, health worker training, and vaccine research. He cited the approach used during the Ebola outbreak in 2014 as an example.\n\nIn June, Rappler already debunked a claim that said Gates is developing COVID-19 vaccines with microchips. Gates said he has \"never been involved in any sort of microchip-type thing.\" There are also no official reports on studies being done on a COVID-19 vaccine that will inject people with a microchip.\n\nReuters and Associated Press have previously debunked the claim that COVID-19 is an acronym for \u201ccertification of vaccination identity\u201d back in April and May. Both organizations said that the claim is baseless.\n\nCOVID-19 was named by WHO back in February. \"Co\" stood for \"corona,\" \"vi\" for \"virus\" and \"d\" for \"disease.\" WHO said it was named as such to avoid stigmatization and association of the disease with a specific geographical location, animal species, or group of people. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also acknowledges this name.\n\nAs for recoveries, scientists have explained that human bodies have the capability to fight off viruses that enter the body by producing antibodies that can kill the viruses. But some factors such as age and underlying conditions such as obesity and diabetes can affect the body\u2019s capability to do so.", "lang": "en"}
