A bystander video of the incident appeared to show a white police officer grabbing Blake by the back of his shirt as Blake tried to enter the vehicle, then shooting him from behind several times at close range.\n\nThe shooting touched off violent protests in Kenosha in the days following Blake\u2019s shooting, and on the evening of Aug. 25, two people were shot and killed, and a third wounded, at one of those protests. Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old \u201cmilitia supporter,\u201d was arrested and charged with the Aug. 25 shootings.\n\nA week later, social media users began circulating a purported tweet from a conservative political figure who supposedly declared that, \u201cWe need more young people like Kyle Rittenhouse and less like Greta Thunberg\u201d (the latter being a 17-year-old Swedish environmental activist):\n\nThe alleged author of the tweet, DeAnna Lorraine, is a political commentator who in 2020 (unsuccessfully) ran as a Republican candidate for the U.S. House representing California\u2019s 12th Congressional District (a seat famously held by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi).\n\nAlthough the tweet was eventually deleted, either by Lorraine or by Twitter, she did in fact post it, as documented by captures from archiving services and Google\u2019s web search cache:", "lang": "en"}
