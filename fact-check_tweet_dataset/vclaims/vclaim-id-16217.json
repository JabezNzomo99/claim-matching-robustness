In response, his colleague from the Netherlands has said that that option \u2018doesn\u2019t exist\u2019 and is impossible. Both of these things cannot be correct.\u201d\n\n\u201cPravd\u011bpodobn\u011b budeme muset opustit celn\u00ed unii\u201d, Boris Johnson told Czech newspaper Hospod\u00e1\u0159sk\u00e9 Noviny the other day\u2014or so it was translated. Rendered back to English, it reads:\n\nIt\u2019s correct that Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem responded negatively to those remarks. He told Newsnight that:\n\nMr Johnson didn\u2019t quite say that he wants to be in the single market but out of the customs union.\n\nHe spoke of \u201cmaintaining free trade\u201d and \u201caccess to\u201d the single market outside the customs union. It\u2019s possible to imagine a fairly free trade arrangement with the EU that doesn\u2019t require single market or customs union membership.\n\nBeing a member of the EU customs union means charging the same taxes on imports from outside the EU as all other members\u2014the \u201ccommon external tariff\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s different to being part of the EU single market. Turkey is an example of a country that\u2019s in a customs union with the EU for non-agricultural goods, but isn\u2019t an EU member and isn\u2019t part of the single market. Customs union membership limits its freedom in negotiating trade agreements with other countries. So on that basis, it does look like there\u2019s quite a \u201cbinary decision\u201d: \u201cin\u201d or \u201cout\u201d.\n\nDaniel Thornton, a Programme Director at the Institute for Government who has written about the customs union, agrees. He points out, as does EU law professor Steve Peers, that under World Trade Organisation rules customs unions are supposed to cover \u201csubstantially all the trade\u201d between participating countries.\n\nSo the UK would have limited room to pick and choose which products were subject to customs union, and which weren\u2019t.\n\nThe Department for Exiting the European Union referred us to comments made by Mrs May\u2019s spokesperson to journalists recently. These were to the effect that there are various aspects to the customs union, including tariffs, customs paperwork and rules of origin. It\u2019s fair to say that with a trade agreement, some of these barriers to trade could be reduced without being in a full-on customs union.", "lang": "en"}
