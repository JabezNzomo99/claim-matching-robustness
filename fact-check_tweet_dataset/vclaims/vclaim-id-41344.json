Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through Yandex Reverse Image Search, some articles with the same video were found in the search results. According to those articles, the video was from an incident in Morocco in 2015. The \u2018Morocco World News\u2019 website in October-2015 wrote, \u2018A young Moroccan woman was attacked by a large crowd of teenage boys with water, eggs and flour in Casablanca last week.\u2019\n\nAt that time, the incident gained a lot of attention as it was portrayed as an attack related to \u2018Islamophobia\u2019. In a fact-check article by \u2018The Observers\u2019 in 2015, it was reported that the incident was not related to \u2018Islamophobia\u2019. The article also included a transcript in which the girl says that the boys in the video are like her brothers and they are just having fun. But, \u2018The Observers\u2019 was not sure about the willingness of the girl in giving the above statement.\n\nTo sum it up, the incident in the video took place in Morocco, not in India.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
