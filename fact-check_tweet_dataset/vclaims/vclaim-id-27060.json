It was posted on January 24 from a Facebook page Kashmir Headlines and received over 80,000 views. The video includes an inflammatory audio commentary in the background where a man can be heard asking Muslim youth to unite against the torture.\n\nThe video was also shared by a few other pages on Facebook.\n\nFrom what it seems, it was viral in Kashmir last month.\n\nThe video had also been shared on Twitter with the identical narrative of brutality by India armed forces on a Kashmiri woman.\n\nAlt News broke the video into multiple frames using InVid software. Upon reverse-searching individual frames on Yandex, we found a website \u2013 doamuslims.org \u2013 which carried a still from the same video in 2015. The website described the atrocity as \u2013 \u201cSyrian army officer torturing an old man and his wife.\u201d\n\nAlt News used Yandex once again to reverse-search the still and landed on multiple reports from 2015 which ascribed the incident to Syria.\n\nMiddle-eastern news channel Al Jazeerawas among the media organisations that reported the incident. Its August 6, 2015 article, published in Arabic, also contains a longer version of the video. The original video does not contain any audio commentary but the man and the woman can be heard screaming. The screenshot below shows the report\u2019s headline translated to English by Google translate.\n\nAccording to the article, activists circulated the video to reveal atrocities of the Syrian army on the country\u2019s women. The man using a whip was described as a member of the Syrian government\u2019s National Defense Forces (NDF).\n\nIt is, thus, clear that an old video from Syria was viral in India as the Indian army\u2019s atrocities on Kashmiri women. Last year, another piece of misinformation was used to target the Indian army in a similar manner. The images of injured Pashto actress Neelam Gul were circulated as Indian army\u2019s brutality on Kashmiri women.", "lang": "en"}
