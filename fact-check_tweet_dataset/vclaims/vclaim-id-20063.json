And experts say it\u2019s not evidence of a resurgence in coal mining.\n\nThe U.S. has added about 1,000 new coal mining jobs since Trump became president, part of a modest 5 percent increase since a modern low of 48,300 jobs in October. But the current number of coal mining jobs, 51,000, is 43 percent lower than in January 2012. Industry experts do not anticipate a return to that level, even with Trump\u2019s efforts to roll back regulations.\n\nTrump has twice referenced the new mine in Pennsylvania as emblematic of a new trend. The first came during the president\u2019s June 1 speech announcing the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\n\nTrump again referenced the mine opening a week later during a speech in Cincinnati.\n\nTrump did not name the Pennsylvania mine, and the White House did not respond to us. But these kinds of events are rare enough that it is clear he is referring to the June 8 grand opening of the Corsa Coal Company\u2019s Acosta Deep Mine more than 60 miles southeast of Pittsburgh.\n\nWhat did Trump\u2019s presidency have to do with its opening? Nothing. Development of the Acosta mine began in September, two months before the presidential election.\n\n\u201cSome of the things this current administration are working on should accrue to the incremental benefit of coal mining,\u201d said Matthew Preston, an analyst at the consultancy group Wood Mackenzie. But he said it was hard to believe any actions of the Trump administration had anything to do with the Acosta mine.\n\n\u201cIt takes years of planning to put a new coal mine on line,\u201d he told us.\n\nAlso of note, the Acosta mine is for metallurgical coal, which is used to create iron and steel, as opposed to thermal coal, which is used to generate electricity. Only about 10 percent of coal production in the U.S. is metallurgical, Preston said.\n\nDemand for metallurgical coal has spiked recently, as Corsa explained in a November financial report, due to \u201cproduction difficulties in China and Australia, and signs of improvement in global steel pricing.\u201d\n\n\u201cExtreme global shortages of metallurgical coal have caused prices to increase 250% since earlier in the year [2016],\u201d Corsa CEO George Dethlefsen said in the report.\n\nHence the decision to develop the new Acosta mine, which is expected to create as many as 100 jobs. At the opening of the Acosta mine, Dethlefsen praised Trump\u2019s agenda to lower regulation and taxes, calling it an end of the \u201cwar on coal.\u201d And he said the company planned to open two more metallurgical coal mines in the next two years.\n\n\u201cThe opening of the Acosta mine has nothing to do with U.S. federal policy,\u201d Trevor Houser, a partner with the economic research company Rhodium Group, told us via email. \u201cThe mine produces metallurgical coal used for steel making. Chinese and Australian mining supply cuts have pushed up the price of metallurgical coal around the world, making US production economical.\u201d\n\nThe longer-term forecast for metallurgical coal is not as rosy. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that while metallurgical coal exports from the U.S. are expected to rise for several years, the long-term trend through 2050 is relatively flat.\n\nAnd as we noted earlier, the bulk of U.S. coal production \u2014 about 90 percent \u2014 is thermal coal, used to generate electricity. And it has not been doing well at all in recent years. According to the Energy Information Administration, coal consumption by the electric power sector declined by nearly 18 percent between 2012 and 2016.\n\nOverall, the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 tracking shows a precipitous decline in coal mining jobs since 2012, with a small increase since October. (On June 5, we wrote about a bogus claim by Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, that the \u201ccoal sector\u201d added 7,000 jobs in May and \u201calmost 50,000 jobs\u201d since the fourth quarter of last year. But he was counting all mining jobs, including oil and gas. As we noted then, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports an increase of just 400 coal mining jobs in May and 1,300 since December.) Here is a graph of the number of coal mining jobs, according to BLS:\n\nAn April report from Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy documents the massive job losses in the coal industry over the last six years. By the end of 2015, the report states, \u201cthe industry had collapsed, with three of the four largest US miners filing for bankruptcy along with many other smaller companies.\u201d\n\nThe authors said the main culprit was the surge in cheaper natural gas production driven by the shale revolution and competition from renewable energy. Environmental regulations \u2014 which Trump has targeted \u2014 also hurt coal mining, but were a \u201csignificantly smaller factor.\u201d\n\nAt best, the report concludes, Trump\u2019s efforts to roll back regulations on coal production would only \u201cstem the recent decline in US coal consumption,\u201d and even then only if natural gas prices increase in the future. The report concludes: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s efforts to roll back environmental regulations will not materially improve economic conditions in America\u2019s coal communities.\u201d\n\nAn April report from the nonprofit Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis also forecast tough times ahead for the coal industry.\n\nIEEFA report, \u201cResearch Brief: U.S. Coal Phase-Out Blow by Blow,\u201d April 2017: At least 46 coal-fired generating units at 25 electricity plants in 16 states will likely close, convert to natural gas, or be intentionally curtailed in 2017 and 2018 as the U.S. electricity sector moves increasingly away from coal and toward other sources of power. These changes will have an adverse impact on the coal-mining industry\u2014and on certain mines and companies in particular\u2014eliminating about 28.2 million tons of annual demand by the end of 2018, an amount of coal worth nearly $1.1 billion, delivered, at 2016 prices. \u2026 While generation at some coal-fired plants around the U.S. has increased during the first quarter of 2017, there is little reason to believe that this represents a long-term trend or anything resembling a recovery for coal. Indeed, the transformative shift in electricity generation across the U.S. is likely to continue as intense cost competition from renewables and natural gas continues a trend toward more coal-fired plant closures and has even led to some nuclear plant retirements over the past few years.\n\nAnd even if demand for coal rises and more mines are developed, that won\u2019t necessarily translate to more jobs.\n\n\u201cIf Trump brings back the coal, it\u2019s not going to bring back the jobs,\u201d Jay Apt, an energy policy professor at Carnegie Mellon University, told the Washington Post. \u201cThose jobs are gone, automation has seen to that.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the Acosta mine is not a good bellwether for the coal industry as a whole, or the prospects for coal mining jobs.", "lang": "en"}
