Scott Turner, R-Frisco, speaking Jan. 8, 2014, at a Texas Public Policy Foundation conference in Austin, said he made it to the NFL despite being sidelined through his first three seasons as a student-athlete at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nTurner, lately an aspirant for speaker of the Texas House, said he thrived as a player only after agreeing to switch from offensive positions to defensive back. Referring to his senior season, Turner said: \"I started the whole year, led the team in interceptions and tackles from defensive back.\"\n\nThat\u2019s quite an accomplishment in that many defenders can pile up tackles and interceptions. We were curious.\n\nThe online 2013 Illinois from the university does not show Turner leading the Fighting Illini in tackles or interceptions in any seasons.\n\nAt our request, Derek Neal, a University of Illinois spokesman, checked the football program\u2019s \"archive book\" for the 1994 season.\n\nBy phone, Neal confirmed that Turner started each of that season\u2019s games at cornerback but said other players led the team in tackles and interceptions.\n\nTurner had 48 tackles, Neal said. Seven players had more: three linebackers, two safeties, a defensive end and defensive tackle. Dana Howard, a linebacker, led with 150 tackles, he said.\n\nTurner had two interceptions that season, Neal said, as did three other players. Another cornerback, Robert Crumpton, led the team with four interceptions, Neal said.\n\nAfter we obtained these figures, Turner told us he\u2019d intended to indicate that he led players at his position--cornerback--in tackles and interceptions; he said by phone that he\u2019d forgotten he trailed a fellow cornerback in interceptions.\n\n\"I know that defensive backs never lead the team in tackles. If you do, that\u2019s a horrible team... If I misspoke, obviously, I apologize for that,\" Turner said. \"I don\u2019t need to embellish the truth. I played.\"\n\nTurner said he started every game of his senior season, leading the team in tackles and interceptions from defensive back.\n\nTurner indeed started every game. But he finished eighth in tackles and tied for second in interceptions with several players. He also did not lead defensive backs in either category.\n\nWe rate this claim as Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE \u2013 The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\n\nClick here for on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
