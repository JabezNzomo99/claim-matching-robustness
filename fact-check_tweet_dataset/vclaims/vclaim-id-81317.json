But the legal requirement to immediately preserve e-mails from nongovernment e-mail accounts was not made mandatory until nearly two years after she stepped down. (We welcome suggestions from readers to expand and update this timeline.)\n\nBefore Clinton becomes secretary of state\n\nOct. 30, 1995: The State Department Foreign Affairs manual is updated to reflect the emergence of something called \u201celectronic mail.\u201d The manual notes: \u201cAll employees must be aware that some of the variety of the messages being exchanged on E-mail are important to the Department and must be preserved; such messages are considered Federal records under the law.\u201d\n\nThe manual then described how to determine which e-mails are such federal records, giving as examples: \u201cRecords that document the formulation and execution of basic policies and decisions and the taking of necessary actions; records that document important meetings; records that facilitate action by agency officials and their successors in office.\u201d\n\nThe manual says that it is up to officials themselves to determine which e-mails should be considered federal records: \u201cE-mail message creators and recipients must decide whether a particular message is appropriate for preservation.\u201d\n\nNov. 4, 2005: The State Department updates the Foreign Affairs manual to state that \u201csensitive but unclassified\u201d information should not be transmitted through personal e-mail accounts. \u201cIt is the Department\u2019s general policy that normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an authorized AIS [Automated Information System], which has the proper level of security control to provide nonrepudiation, authentication and encryption, to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the resident information,\u201d the manual says.\n\nOct. 2, 2009: The U.S. Code of federal regulations on handling electronic records is updated: \u201cAgencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system.\u201d The responsibility for making and preserving the records is assigned to \u201cthe head of each federal agency.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Ambassador\u2019s requirements for use of commercial e-mail in the office and his flouting of direct instructions to adhere to Department policy have placed the information management staff in a conundrum: balancing the desire to be responsive to their mission leader and the need to adhere to Department regulations and government information security standards,\u201d the IG report said.\n\nMarch 15, 2013: Clinton\u2019s private e-mail account is first exposed after a hacker named \u201cGuccifer\u201d accessed the account of former Bill Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal. The hack shows that Clinton communicated with Blumenthal using the private e-mail account of hdr22@clintonemail.com, and Guccifer published a screen grab of their exchanges showing that the two discussed a number of sensitive foreign policy issues.\n\nThe leak attracted little attention at the time, though an article in Gawker asked, \u201cWhy was Clinton apparently receiving emails at a non-governmental e-mail account?\u201d John Cook, the author, added: \u201cNeither the State Department nor the White House would immediately comment on whether the White House knew that Blumenthal was digitally whispering in Clinton\u2019s ear, or if the e-mails were preserved as the law requires.\u201d (Cook later said that Gawker filed a Freedom of Information request for copies of the emails, citing the specific e-mail address, but was told by State no records existed.)\n\nSept. 9, 2013: The National Archives updates regulations on the handling of e-mails and federal records: \u201cWhile agency employees should not generally use personal email accounts to conduct official agency business, there may be times when agencies authorize the use of personal email accounts, such as in emergency situations when Federal accounts are not accessible or when an employee is initially contacted through a personal account.\u201d\n\nNov. 14, 2014: President Obama signs an update of the 1950 Presidential and Federal Records Act. The law expanded the definition of \u201cfederal records\u201d to specifically include electronic communications. The law also clarified the responsibilities of federal government officials when they use nongovernment email systems, which includes copying an official record or forwarding a complete copy of the e-mail within 20 days of transmission.\n\nMarch 10, 2015: Clinton tells reporters that she set up the system because she did not want to carry two devices\u2013one for work email and one for personal e-mail. She says she turned over 30,490 work-related e-mails to the State Department and deleted 31,830 e-mails that she deemed to be personal.", "lang": "en"}
