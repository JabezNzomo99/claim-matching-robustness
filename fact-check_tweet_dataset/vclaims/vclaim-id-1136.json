It also makes further secondary claims beyond the scope of this check.\n\nThe article includes video from a 2007 NBC special report predicting what technological advancements would be made in the next 10 years, visible youtu.be/1YJsxMcAJoA . Anchor Brian Williams can be heard saying: \u201cLife in the U.S. in 10 years\u2019 time. By that time, there may be all kinds of new ways to safeguard and identify all those things that make each of us unique. Our faces, even our fingerprints, even our eyes.\u201d\n\nJournalist Tom Costello continues the report on \u201cthe future of technology\u201d.
