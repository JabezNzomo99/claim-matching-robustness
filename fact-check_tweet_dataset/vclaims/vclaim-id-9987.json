It depends on whom you ask.\n\nOn Oct. 30, court papers revealed that Papadopoulos had pled guilty to lying to the FBI earlier that month. The case involved efforts by Papadopoulos, in his capacity as a Trump campaign staffer, to allegedly connect other campaign staff with officials representing Russia, including the possibility of securing \"thousands of emails\" about Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders took issue with any notion that Papadopoulos was a key member of the campaign team hours after the guilty plea made headlines.\n\nAsked at the daily news briefing to explain Papadopoulos\u2019 role with the campaign, Sanders said, \"It was extremely limited. It was a volunteer position. And again, no activity was ever done in an official capacity on behalf of the campaign.\"\n\nDetermining how important Papadopoulos was on the Trump team is open to interpretation, so we won\u2019t put this argument to the Truth-O-Meter. But we thought it would be worthwhile to lay out the evidence, so that readers can make a more informed judgment.\n\nThe fact that Papadopoulos was working for the campaign became widely known on March 21, 2016, when the campaign, for the first time, released the names of its foreign policy advisers.\n\nTrump revealed the list of five advisers -- Keith Kellogg, Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, Walid Phares and Joseph Schmitz -- in a meeting with editors and reporters at the Washington Post.\n\nIn that meeting, he called Papadopoulos an \"excellent guy.\"\n\nThe Post followed up with an article that framed the announcement this way: \"Republican presidential contender Donald Trump on Monday provided five names on his foreign policy team after months of speculation over who could be advising the businessman front-runner.\"\n\nThe Post noted that Papadopoulos had previously advised one of Trump\u2019s Republican primary rivals, Ben Carson, and had worked for the conservative Hudson Institute. Perhaps the tidbit that garnered the most attention at the time was that on his LinkedIn page, he listed among his awards and honors \"that he was U.S. Representative at the 2012 Geneva International Model United Nations.\"\n\nThe Post reported that Papadopoulos \"confirmed \u2026 that he was an adviser to Trump but declined further comment.\"\n\nA few weeks later, the Los Angeles Times included Papadopoulos in its own list of Trump foreign policy advisers, which also listed the other four officials from the Post article along with three additional names -- Gary Harrell, Chuck Kubic and Bert Mizusawa.\n\nMeanwhile, even hours after his guilty plea was announced, Papadopoulos was still touting the support of Trump from the Post editorial board meeting on his LinkedIn page. The first line was: \"President Trump recommendation about me: \u2018George is an oil and gas consultant; excellent guy.\"\n\nOn March 31, Trump tweeted out a photograph of himself leading a meeting of his foreign policy team. The photograph -- labeled \"National Security Meeting\" and with the hashtag \"#MakeAmericaGreatAgain\" -- features future Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Trump at opposite ends of the table, apparently joined by other officials cited in the Post and Los Angeles Times stories, including Papadopoulos, the second person away from Sessions on the far side of the table.\n\nWe didn\u2019t find any substance from the meeting released the day it happened, but according to materials released by special counsel Robert Mueller's office, when Papadopoulos \"introduced himself to the group, he stated, in sum and substance, that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and President Putin.\"\n\nIn the White House briefing, Sanders dismissed the significance of the March 31 meeting.\n\n\"It was a brief meeting that took place quite some time ago,\" Sanders said. \"It was the one time that group ever met.\"\n\nLater activities alleged in the Special Counsel\u2019s documents\n\nThe special counsel's documents say that in early April 2016, Papadopoulos \"sent multiple emails to other members of the campaign's foreign policy team regarding his contacts with 'the Russians' and his 'outreach to Russia.\u2019\"\n\nAfter pursuing this on the Russian side, the documents say, Papadopoulos continued his push on April 25, emailing a \"senior policy advisor\" for the campaign and reiterating the offer. He sent similar emails to at least one other high-ranking campaign official over the next few days.\n\nEmail inquiries continued with these and other senior campaign officials through the summer and as late as August, according to the documents.\n\nIn the White House briefing, Sanders acknowledged that Papadopoulos had \"reached out\" with the Russia offer, but she emphasized that \"nothing happened beyond that.\"\n\nThis, she said, \"shows, one, his level of importance in the campaign, and two, shows what little role he had within coordinating anything officially for the campaign.\"\n\nThere is some evidence to support the argument that Papadopoulos was freelancing by pushing the Russia connection.\n\nThe most compelling case for this was made in an Aug. 14 Washington Post article. The report said it was based on \"more than 20,000 pages of documents the Trump campaign turned over to congressional committees\" and \"read to the Post by a person with access to them.\"\n\nThis raw material provides more context about how other Trump campaign officials responded to Papadopoulos\u2019 offer than the Special Counsel\u2019s documents do -- and the picture they paint is one of an effort ultimately stymied by senior campaign officials.\n\nWe can\u2019t independently confirm the Post\u2019s reporting, but its report suggests that several senior campaign officials urged caution about meeting with Russians, so that the campaign didn\u2019t embarrass itself or run afoul of legal restrictions.\n\nFor instance, the Post reported that when Papadopoulos sent an an email about meeting with Russia to Paul Manafort, the new campaign chair, \"Manafort reacted coolly, forwarding the email to his associate Rick Gates, with a note, \u2018We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips.\u2019\"", "lang": "en"}
