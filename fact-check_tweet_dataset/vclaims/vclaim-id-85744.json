In his tweet, Trump demanded a \u201clook at the facts,\u201d so let\u2019s see whether he has a case for toughness. The answer is not necessarily clear. It depends on whether one looks at presidential tone or the administration\u2019s actions.\n\nObama, much like Trump, entered office seeking to improve relations with Russia, even to the point that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton presented the Russian foreign minister with a button marked with what was meant to be the word \u201creset\u201d (with the word misspelled in Russian). Vladimir Putin, because of term limits, was forced to step down as president, and Obama thought he had forged a connection with Dmitry Medvedev, who filled the one-term gap before Putin returned to the presidency. The United States and Russia completed a nuclear-weapons agreement, and Obama paved the way for Russia to join the World Trade Organization.\n\nDuring the 2012 campaign, Obama famously knocked GOP nominee Mitt Romney for calling Russia the \u201cNo. 1 geopolitical foe\u201d of the United States. In a zinger that now looks foolish in retrospect, Obama chided Romney during the third presidential debate: \u201cThe 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War\u2019s been over for 20 years.\u201d\n\nBut Russia\u2019s military intervention in Ukraine and swift annexation of Crimea in 2014 stunned the Obama administration and led to a much tougher stance. Within months, the administration announced the European Reassurance Initiative, designed to bolster forces in Europe and enhance deterrence. The administration also imposed sanctions on Russia over the incursion, building on the Magnitsky Act.\n\nDuring the 2016 election campaign, the Obama administration raised alarms over possible interference by Moscow. Just weeks before the election, the administration announced that Russia was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee. On Dec. 29, 2016, Obama imposed sanctions, including the expulsion of some three dozen Russian diplomats and intelligence officials and the closure of diplomatic compounds.\n\nTrump came into office also seeking to improve relations with Russia. During the campaign, he often complimented Putin, and he raved about how Putin had called him a \u201cgenius,\u201d even if that was not correct. When Obama imposed sanctions. Trump\u2019s incoming national security adviser, Michael Flynn, told the Russians not to immediately respond in kind. (Flynn has since pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about those conversations.)\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, defending the president\u2019s tweets, cited a number of actions that she said showed Trump had been \u201cextremely tough\u201d on Russia. The list included bolstering annual defense spending to $700 billion by eliminating the defense sequester, exporting energy to Eastern Europe, and arming Ukraine with lethal weapons such as antitank missiles. The State Department also closed three Russian diplomatic posts in San Francisco, Washington and New York after Russia finally retaliated against Obama\u2019s election-related sanctions.\n\nThere is merit in this argument. (One could also add the proposed bolstering of nuclear forces in the recently released Nuclear Posture Review.) It is possible that a Hillary Clinton administration might have taken somewhat similar steps, since these resemble a continuation of Obama administration policies. But, nevertheless, these actions represent a toughening of the U.S. stance and certainly do not make Russia happy.\n\nTrump, for unexplained reasons, personally has been weak in responding to the actions attributed to Russia during the election. Congress, with veto-proof majorities, in 2017 passed the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which imposed sanctions on Russia. Trump only grudgingly signed it, calling it \u201cseriously flawed\u201d because he said it limited his flexibility. \u201cThis bill makes it harder for the United States to strike good deals for the American people,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nMoreover, the administration then refused to implement the sanctions as scheduled, on the grounds that the mere passage of the law had already served as a deterrent. Trump has also highlighted Putin\u2019s denial of any involvement, even though intelligence officials say such an operation could only have been undertaken with Putin\u2019s approval.\n\nOne often has a sense that Trump operates independently of the vast government he oversees. The administration certainly has taken steps that represent a toughening of the Obama administration\u2019s policies, such as the supply of lethal weapons to Ukraine. But Trump himself has continued with rhetoric and tone that suggests he still wants to be Putin\u2019s friend. He cannot bring himself to fault Russia for its actions, instead accusing Obama of not doing enough to thwart Russia.\n\nIt certainly took Obama many years to become a Russia skeptic. But when it comes to being tough on Russia for its election activities, Trump falls short of the actions taken by Obama, especially when he frames it as: \u201cI have been much tougher.\u201d We wavered between Two and Three Pinocchios, but Trump\u2019s use of the personal pronoun tips us to Three.", "lang": "en"}
