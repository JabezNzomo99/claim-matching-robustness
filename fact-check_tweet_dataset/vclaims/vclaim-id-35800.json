The results of the election will be out on Tuesday (February 11, 2020)\n\n\n\nThe fake tweet reads, \"We are losing Delhi assembly elections because our Delhi Leadership like Pravesh Verma , Harshavardhan & Ramesh Bidhuri are working against party . Inki dushmani mujhse hai (They have enmity with me)\"\n\nClick here to view, and here for an archive.\n\n\n\nThe viral image was shared by a Facebook page named FekuExpress with the caption, \"Tweet deleted later\". The post had around 182 shares and one thousand reactions while writing the article.\n\nA Twitter handle \"Aggressive Aam Aadmi\" had shared the fake screenshot on Twitter on February 8, 2020, with the caption, \"Why was this tweet deleted? @ManojTiwariMP\"\n\nClick here to view, and here for an archive.\n\nAlso Read: No, The BJP Is Not Distributing Blankets To People Faking Disabilties\n\nBOOM found that the viral screenshot of Tiwari's tweet is fake and was created using an app named 'Fake Tweeter'.\n\nBOOM checked Tiwari's Twitter timeline and did not find any such tweet. We also performed a advanced Twitter search using @ManojTiwariMP and we did not find any replies to any deleted tweet by Tiwari on the date mentioned in the screenshot. We also looked for archives of the tweet but did not find any.\n\n\n\nWe installed the 'Fake Tweeter' app and created our own fake tweet using Tiwari's Twitter handle name (@ManojTiwariMP) and his profile picture. The fake tweet generated using the app showed that the profile pictures of the accounts that liked the tweet shown in the viral image and our fake tweet match.\n\nOne can spot in the BOOM created tweet that the accounts that have liked the tweet are same in the viral screenshot which shows that it was created using the app.\n\nThe app lets a user create a screenshot of a fake tweet with any handle name with the desired text, and one can also select the number of retweets, comments and likes that can be displayed.", "lang": "en"}
