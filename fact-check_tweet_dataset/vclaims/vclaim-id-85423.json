We also catalogued the president\u2019s many flip-flops, since those earn Upside-Down Pinocchios if a politician shifts position on an issue without acknowledging he or she did so.\n\nWhile the president is known to make outrageous claims on Twitter \u2014 and that was certainly a major source of his falsehoods \u2014 he made most of his false statements in unscripted remarks before reporters. (Interviews were another major source of false claims.) That\u2019s because the president would rely on talking points or assertions that he had made in the past \u2014 and continued to make, even though they had been fact-checked as wrong.\n\nHe gave himself credit for the January jobs report \u2014 216,000 jobs \u2014 even though the data was collected the week of Jan. 12, before he became president. (In other words, the gain in jobs took place from Dec. 12 to Jan. 12.)\n\nAmong other deals, Trump took credit for $1 billion investment by Fiat Chrysler (which the company said was due to talks with unions in 2015), $1 billion General Motors investment (also in the works for some time), 10,000 jobs added by Walmart (announced in October), 10,000 jobs created by Intel (announced originally in 2011), 1 million planned jobs by Chinese e-company Alibaba (a plan outlined in 2015), and a $25 billion investment by Charter Communications (in the works since 2015). Trump also touted a big investment by Japanese company SoftBank \u2014 which announced its investment fund three weeks before the U.S. elections, when Trump faced a narrow path to victory.\n\nOn at least 15 occasions, Trump boasted that he had personally negotiated a cut between $600 million and $725 million off an order for Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. But Lockheed had already planned the cost reductions, saying in December that the next batch of 90 planes would cost six to seven percent less per plane than the previous order. (This was well before any meeting that Trump had with the company\u2019s chief executive.) The Air Force\u2019s budget had already accounted for the cut in price \u2014 and the price is expected to keep dropping.\n\nAnother Trump favorite was claiming \u2014 seven times \u2014 that the United States had spent $6 trillion on wars in \u201cthe Middle East.\u201d He usually utters this figure to note the money would have been better spent in the United States. But Trump is lumping together the wars in Iraq (in the Middle East) and Afghanistan (in South Asia), which together cost about $1.6 trillion from 2001 to 2014. He is also adding in estimates of future spending, such as interest on the debt and veterans\u2019 care for the next three decades.\n\nTrump has also repeatedly asserted (17 times) that the Affordable Care Act was failing or on the edge of disaster or in serious trouble. But the Congressional Budget Office has said that the Obamacare exchanges, despite well-documented issues, is not imploding and is expected to remain stable for the foreseeable future. Trump, as he did during the campaign, also cherry-picked numbers about premium increases to make the increases sound worse than reality.\n\nTrump repeatedly also blamed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)\u2014\u201cthe worst trade deal ever made by any country\u201d\u2013 for resulting in the loss of one-third of U.S. manufacturing jobs. He also claimed that the entry of China into the World Trade Organization led to the closure of as many as 70,000 factories.\n\nBut the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service in 2017 concluded the \u201cnet overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP.\u201d Meanwhile, manufacturing jobs in the United States have been adversely affected by many factors, especially changing consumer tastes and technology. Drawing a connection between China\u2019s entry in the WTO and factory losses is a stretch, especially because the Great Recession played a big role in factory closings.\n\nJudging from Trump\u2019s repeated false claims, one would think that he is not a regular reader. But on March 21, Trump remarked that the news media was too judgmental about his statements. \u201cIf it\u2019s off by 100th of a percent, it\u2019s like I end up getting Pinocchios,\u201d he said.", "lang": "en"}
