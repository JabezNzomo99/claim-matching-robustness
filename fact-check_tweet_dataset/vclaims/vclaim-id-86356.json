Trump held eight campaign rallies between Jan. 21 (when covid-19 was confirmed in the United States) and March 2. His speeches focused on just about everything else \u2014 at one point referring to concerns about the coronavirus as the Democrats\u2019 \u201cnew hoax,\u201d akin to the Russia investigation and the Ukraine-related impeachment probe.\n\nThe Fact Checker collected data of social media posts from Brandwatch, a digital consumer intelligence company, Crowdtangle, a social media analytics tool owned by Facebook, and Nick Monaco at the at the Institute for the Future\u2019s Digital Intelligence Lab. The data shows that Trump\u2019s conversation about the coronavirus online was minimal in late January and February, even though Trump in late January announced that he would impose some travel restrictions on non-U. S. citizens traveling from China. His campaign and surrogates echoed the same trend.\n\n\u201cWhen he was getting the intelligence on this back in \u2026 January, (if he) took the same level of seriousness about it that other nations were starting to do, had utilized the Defense Production Act fully, which still has not to this day been fully implemented relative to the things that we need and that the businesses in particular could do and have offered to do,\u201d said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee. \u201cIf all of those early pieces had been put in place, you\u2019d have a very different narrative today.\u201d\n\nThe refocus on coronavirus was reflected in the Trump campaign\u2019s online rhetoric, too. However, the ways in which he and his campaign talked about covid-19 online were often not based in facts or misrepresented the reality of the situation. For instance his most talked about topics at this time included the terms \u201cChinese virus\u201d and \u201cFake News.\u201d\n\nThe campaign apparatus promoted videos online that tried to rewrite the narrative. For example, this video, which bashed the media\u2019s response, skipped over February, trying to erase a period of slow intervention by the administration. (Trump in February also kept saying that the virus would soon go away and praised China for its handling of the crisis.) The campaign also shared cherry-picked video clips on social media, highlighting Trump\u2019s comments at news conferences that were inaccurate. Other videos clipped politicians and governor\u2019s statements or used the wrong context for their quotes. The ads inaccurately made it sound as if these people were praising Trump\u2019s response. Lastly, video ads deflected blame to China and used this talking point to attack political rivals such as Biden, Trump\u2019s likely opponent in this year\u2019s presidential contest.\n\n\u201cOne of my biggest concerns about the way that the pandemic is already shifting and will continue to shift online political campaigning is that it will drive the discourse to be even more uncivil, to be even more provocative, to be ultimately potentially hateful,\u201d said Rebekah Tromble, professor of media, politics, digital research and ethics at George Washington University.\n\n\u201cIf some areas, cities, states or what have you, jump over those various checkpoints and prematurely open up without having the capability of being able to respond effectively and efficiently, my concern is that we will start to see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks,\u201d said Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \u201cI have been very clear in my message \u2014 to try, to the best extent possible, to go by the guidelines, which have been very well thought out and very well delineated.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the businessman. He\u2019s the person there to lead the economy,\u201d Tromble said. \u201cWe\u2019re now in a situation where we\u2019re looking at Great Depression levels of unemployment, and we can\u2019t deny that the economy is in a free fall. And so that particular message is lost unless the Trump administration reshifts to trying to reopen the economy. And that\u2019s very clearly what they\u2019re doing now.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the economy, Trump and his team have moved on to discussing new topics online. Their posts and ads have often focused on controversial and inflammatory topics, such as charges against former national security adviser Michael Flynn and attacks directed at the news media or House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). The campaign has also launched ads targeting Biden that include age-related attacks and conspiracy theories about his ties to China.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether this messaging is effective with voters and will affect the way in which Americans remember the pandemic. A Washington Post-Ipsos poll from April 27 to May 4 showed 43 percent of Americans approved of Trump\u2019s handling of the outbreak. While Trump pushes to reopen, some Republican governors are facing pushback for moving into that phase too quickly.\n\n\u201cWe expect our presidents to be optimistic about the future,\u201d Steele said. \u201cBut there\u2019s also a level of realism in that optimism. Because we know real, we see that and we still see people getting sick and dying around us. And so I think perspective is really what people are looking for.\"", "lang": "en"}
