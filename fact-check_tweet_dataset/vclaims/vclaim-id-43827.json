The articles were posted to Facebook and Instagram, where they have been shared hundreds of times.\n\nHowever, this claim is not true; Marin informally proposed the idea during a panel in August 2019 when she was Minister of Transport.\n\nOn the panel, which was part of the 120th-anniversary celebrations of the Social Democratic Party she said: \u201cA four-day work week, a six-hour workday. Why couldn\u2019t it be the next step? Is eight hours really the ultimate truth? I believe people deserve to spend more time with their families, loved ones, hobbies and other aspects of life, such as culture. This could be the next step for us in working life.\u201d\n\nThe Finnish government rebutted the claim this was now government policy in a Twitter post last week. The post read: \u201cIn the Finnish Government\u00b4s program there is no mention about 4-day week. Issue is not on the Finnish Government\u2019s agenda. PM @marinsanna envisioned idea briefly in a panel discussion last August while she was the Minister of Transport, and there hasn\u2019t been any recent activity.\u201d\n\nFollowing the response from the Finnish government, many publications corrected their story.", "lang": "en"}
