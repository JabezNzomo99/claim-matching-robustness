In practice, it has been more complicated. First came the backlash this winter over her suggestion that the Israel lobby was using its resources to buy off supporters \u2014 \u2018it\u2019s all about the Benjamins,\u2019 she tweeted. Omar apologized for the remark, but she also blamed her colleagues for overreacting.\u201d Associating Jews with money in this way echoes long-standing anti-Semitic slurs and tropes.\n\nOmar said the Muslim community at large should not be held accountable for the actions of Islamic terrorists. \u201cI think the general population needs to understand that there is a difference between the people that are carrying on the evil acts \u2014 because it is an evil act, and we do have evil people in this world \u2014 and then the normal people who carry on, the normal people, regular citizens who carry on their life,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said there\u2019s a double standard in the way Western societies respond to mass murder. \u201cWhen you have an individual \u2026 in a Western society that goes on and does commit like a mass murder \u2014 we have mass shootings that happen constantly here \u2014 we investigate that person and what has driven them to commit that act,\u201d Omar said. \u201cWhen an act is committed by these Muslim, you know, terrorists, what we investigate is that whole community, we investigate that whole faith, we investigate that whole society, and everyone is supposed to have some answer to why these people are doing this.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t say \u2018America\u2019 with an intensity. You don\u2019t say \u2018England\u2019 with an intensity. You don\u2019t say \u2018the Army\u2019 with an intensity. But you say these names because you want that word to carry weight. You want it to leave something with the person that\u2019s hearing. It\u2019s said with a deeper voice.\u201d\n\nA longer look at what she said: \u201cFor far too long, we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and, frankly, I\u2019m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it. CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
