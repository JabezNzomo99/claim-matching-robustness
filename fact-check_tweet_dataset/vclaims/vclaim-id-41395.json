No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to educate gullible Trump supporters and Republicans about the need to actually click and read links before sharing or liking them in order to avoid being embarrassed by fans of the site later. All the events described in the article are not real and meant as humor and social commentary but we are sure the story will soon be copied by various fake news sites being run out of places like Macedonia and Pakistan who wil then peddle it as real news.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Taters Gonna Tate on July 3, 2019 titled \"President Trump: \"I Will Pay For July 4 Parade Out Of My Own Pocket\"\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe liberal press hasn't been able to stop talking about the price tag of the July 4 extravaganza that will be hosted by President Trump in and around the National Mall tomorrow. All that's been heard from them is \"Boo hoo! $90 million. Taxpayers on the hook. Blah blah blah\". Not once have they taken the time to marvel at and thank our President for putting together the greatest celebration of our nation's independence ever seen. But now they can stop their crying. In an announcement that came as a surprise only to the democrats, the White House tells us that President Trump will pay the full price tag for the event out of his own pocket.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nIt was literally published in the category \"Satire and/or Conservative Fan Fiction\". The stock image used with the story shows a parade in New York from 2009:\n\nThe site is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run byself-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other fact checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction to this he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry extremely visible disclaimers everywhere.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nBlair and his operation were profiled by the Washington Post on November 17, 2018 by Eli Saslow:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes tatersgonnatate.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
