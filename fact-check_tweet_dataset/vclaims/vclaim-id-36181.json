The maps the claims are based on are not satellite images, and they do not show real, observed data on current levels of sulphur dioxide. NASA, which provided the data in the first place, told Full Fact that they are simply forecasts based on weather patterns and historical information about SO2 emissions.\n\nWhere the claim comes from\n\nThe claims originated on social media, including one particularly viral Twitter thread. They suggest that an apparent surge in SO2 levels above Wuhan and Chongqing, both cities affected by the outbreak of the new Covid-19 coronavirus, could be evidence of mass cremations, on the grounds that SO2 is released when a corpse is burned.\n\nThey are based on screenshots from a weather forecast site called Windy.com. In addition to standard weather forecast features, Windy offers options to display predictions for levels of various pollutants, such as particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and sulphur dioxide. The screenshots are of the sulphur dioxide three day forecasts for the Wuhan area from the weekend beginning Saturday, 8 February (you can see the equivalent current forecast here).\n\nBut (as was pointed out in a thread on Reddit) that\u2019s all they are: forecasts. They don\u2019t show what actually happened.\n\nWindy.com says that the SO2 forecast uses data from NASA\u2019s GEOS-5 atmospheric modelling system. Dr. Arlindo M da Silva, a research meteorologist from NASA\u2019s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office, told Full Fact that the GEOS-5 sulphur dioxide models do not \u201cassimilate real satellite data\u201d into their forecasts, but instead are based on past evidence of emission levels.\n\n\u201cOur forecasts are based on fixed emission inventories,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cAlthough satellite data has been used in the construction of the emission inventories, these emissions do not account for the day-to-day variations in SO2 emissions and as such cannot account for sudden changes in human activity. In GEOS-5, day-to-day variations in SO2 are due to variations in the meteorological conditions, in particular winds.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the maps in question are not based on any real-time observations; instead they are simply predictions based on weather patterns. As such they could not possibly show an unexpected event such as a mass cremation.", "lang": "en"}
