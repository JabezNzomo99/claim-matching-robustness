It claims the blue or coloured side facing out means the wearer is sick and doesn\u2019t want to spread their illness, whereas the white side facing out means they\u2019re healthy and don\u2019t want to catch anything.\n\nThe conversation has been sparked by the recent outbreak of a new coronavirus (now known as Covid-19) and the increased demand for protective masks. However, the post is incorrect. Generally, if a mask has a coloured side, it is advised that this is pointed outwards. The co-director of the World Health Organisation Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, Dr Seto Wing Hong, can be seen demonstrating how to wear a mask. As he says, the two sides have particular functions, which would be impeded if worn the wrong way.\n\nNevertheless, you should always read the manufacturer\u2019s instructions on your chosen mask.\n\nFace coverings, which can include masks, are currently mandatory in England in a range of indoor settings, such as public transport and shops for people over the age of 11 who are not exempt for either professional or health reasons. Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales have their own guidance", "lang": "en"}
