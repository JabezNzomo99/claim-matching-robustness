To anger a liberal, tell him the truth.\"\n\nThe quote was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThere is no date or source provided with the quote and we could not find any official record of Roosevelt ever saying this. The quote has been floating around online in the form of memes and a discussion board topic for years, and has been debunked as a faux quote before.\n\nWe checked with the Theodore Roosevelt Association, a historical and cultural organization dedicated to honoring the life and work of the 26th president, and nothing close to those words turned up in an archive of Roosevelt\u2019s speeches and letters.\n\nBarry Popik, an etymologist and consulting editor for the Oxford English Dictionary, also researched the quote in 2013 and found no evidence Roosevelt said it. Popik discovered the phrase first appeared in print sometime around 2007, well after Roosevelt\u2019s lifetime. On online message boards and blogs dating back to 2002, the quote was simply attributed to no one, appearing in signatures or in the middle of bodies of text with no source.\n\nThe quote also isn\u2019t included on the Theodore Roosevelt Center\u2019s list of verified and unverified Roosevelt quotes.\n\nWe rate this false Roosevelt quote Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
