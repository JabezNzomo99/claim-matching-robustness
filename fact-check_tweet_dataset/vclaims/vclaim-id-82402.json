The supposed quote does not actually appear in the movie.\n\nThe claim that Trump allegedly plagiarized the \u201cBee Movie\u201d during his 2017 inaugural address has circulated online since January 2017. This particular Facebook post juxtaposes photos of Trump and Barry B. Benson, the character voiced by actor Jerry Seinfeld in the \u201cBee Movie,\u201d along with two purportedly similar quotes.\n\n\u201cWe are one colony \u2013 and their pain is our pain,\u201d the post allegedly quotes from the animated film. \u201cTheir dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one hive, and one glorious destiny.\u201d (RELATED: Did Donald Trump Say, \u2018If You Elect Joe Biden, There Will Be No Hand Sanitizer\u2019?)\n\nWhile Trump did say the quote the post attributes to him in his inaugural address, per the transcript from the White House, it was not plagiarized from the \u201cBee Movie.\u201d Searching through online transcripts of the \u201cBee Movie\u201d turned up no instances of the alleged quote from Barry B. Benson. Had Trump actually lifted the lines from the animated movie, it almost certainly would have been reported by major U.S. news outlets, yet none appear to have done so.\n\nA similar claim about Trump plagiarizing words from \u201cAvatar\u201d also circulated after his inauguration in 2017, though Snopes found no record of the words attributed to \u201cAvatar\u201d in transcripts of the movie available online.", "lang": "en"}
