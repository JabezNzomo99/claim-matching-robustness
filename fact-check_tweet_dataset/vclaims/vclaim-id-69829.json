The prime minister\u2019s office said the notification was fake and misleading. A lawyer told AFP such a decision would be in breach of the law. A check of the Press Information Department announcements and the Pakistan Gazette shows no such decision has been made.\n\nThe report on the Times of Islamabad website was titled: Federal Cabinet takes important decision about all government employees in Pakistan.\n\n\u201cFederal Cabinet under chairmanship of PM Imran Khan has decided not to dismiss government employees,\" the report said.\n\n\u201cAt the Prime Minister office, an official notification was issued that read 'no government employee will be sacked from his job',\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cEmployees can not be dismissed, even if they violate the discipline,\u201d the report claims the notification says.\n\nA copy of the fake circular sent to AFP by the prime minister's office said: \"it is hereby advised not to terminate the services of any employee, serving in subordinate staff/junior cadre on regular/contract/adhoc basis, on any grounds including disciplinary action till further order.\"\n\nThe prime minister's office issued a denial on September 7 saying the purported circular was fake.\n\n\u201cIt is clarified for public information that a circular bearing number 'F.P.M(Cir)/2134/DS(G)/2018 dated 28 August 2018' purportedly originating from the Prime Minister\u2019s Office regarding termination/retention of employees is fake and misleading.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe general public is also requested not to lend credence to such fictitious and misleading communications,\u201d it said.\n\nBarrister Syed Masroor Shah, a lawyer who deals with employment cases, told AFP that the government has hiring and firing powers over all employees.\n\nBut the government, by law, cannot prevent an employee found guilty on disciplinary grounds from being fired, he said.\n\n\"The government has the powers to sack or hire any employee, but those getting sacked after an inquiry and disciplinary action cannot be retained,\" Shah told AFP.\n\nThe Times of Islamabad posted a photo purportedly of the cabinet meeting at which the decision was made. But it is an old photograph which was widely used in August.\n\nThe Federal Government\u2019s Press and Information Department (PID) issued a different photo of the actual cabinet meeting on September 5 on their Facebook page.\n\nThe report was shared by the Times of Islamabad on its social media accounts which have more than half a million followers.\n\nThe report was not removed or amended after the government issued its denial.\n\nOfficial Pakistan government circulars are routinely sent to the Press Information Department for distribution. A circular concerning the firing of staff has not been circulated through official channels.\n\nNew government decisions and laws are published in the Gazette of Pakistan, but no mention of the alleged staffing decision has appeared in the two weeks since the fake and misleading circular first surfaced online.", "lang": "en"}
