Scott Fitzgerald once stated, \u201cIt\u2019s never too late to be whoever you want to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope you live a life you\u2019re proud of, and if you find that you\u2019re not, I hope you have the strength to start over,\u201d the quote continues.\n\nThere is no evidence that Fitzgerald ever said or wrote this quote. It appears to have originated with the 2008 movie \u201cThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button,\u201d a film based on Fitzgerald\u2019s short story of the same name.\n\nFitzgerald, one of the most influential American writers of the 20th century, is best known for his portrayals of the Jazz Age in America, having written acclaimed books like \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d\n\nHowever, nowhere in this book, or any of his other writings, did The Daily Caller News Foundation find the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post.\n\nSeveral Fitzgerald scholars, including Kirk Curnutt, David S. Brown and Thomas Birch, said in emails to TheDCNF that they did not recognize the quotation. Brown, author of \u201cParadise Lost: A Life of F. Scott Fitzgerald,\u201d believes the quote originated with the 2008 movie \u201cThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button,\u201d a film loosely based on Fitzgerald\u2019s short story of the same name.\n\nAt one point in the movie, actor Brad Pitt, playing the title character, goes into a short monologue:\n\n\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth: it\u2019s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. There\u2019s no time limit, start whenever you want. You can change or stay the same, there are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it. I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you never felt before. I hope you meet people with a different point of view. I hope you live a life you\u2019re proud of. And if you find that you\u2019re not, I hope you have the strength to start all over again.\u201d\n\nThe quote featured in the Facebook post roughly combines the beginning and end of this monologue, which appears to be a creation of the film\u2019s screenwriter, Eric Roth, as it is not found in Fitzgerald\u2019s short story.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
