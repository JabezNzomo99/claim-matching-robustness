His figure of 60 million is way more than the 80 million quoted by the Agency. Also, the NBS\u2019s figure of illiterate Nigerians of 70 million is more than Prinzo\u2019s reported figure. In fact, the number of out-of-school children isn\u2019t 11 million as he said; it is 13.2 million according to UNICEF.\n\nWith an estimated population of 180 million, Mr Prinzo\u2019s estimate of 60 million illiterate youths and adults mean one-third of people who call Nigeria home are illiterate, the report read.\n\nMr Prinzo also said that of this figure, females account for nearly 60% of the population, with 11 million children out-of-school.\n\nCould it be true that 60 million Nigerians are illiterate, of which 60% are female, and 11 million are out-of-school? Dubawa findings show that the figures are off the track!\n\nMr Prinzo made reference to \u201cyouths and adults\u201d. Therefore, the age bracket he was referring to is not clear-cut. For instance, on one hand, the definition of adult as defined by the Consolidated Antiretroviral (ARV) Guidelines of June 2013 of the WHO is: \u201ca person older than 19 years of age unless national law defines a person as being an adult at an earlier age\u201d. This implies that, the term \u201cadult\u201d, as used by Prinzo, would include anyone of age 19 and above. Meaning the age bracket under consideration is limitless. The least age limit that can then be considered is Nigeria\u2019s life expectancy \u2013 59.3 years. defines a youth as persons of ages 18-35 years. Hence, when used together, youths and adults would include anyone of age 18 and above \u2014 the likeliest limit being 59 years. On another hand is the term \u2018youth\u2019. The Nigerian National Youth Policy (2009) defines a youth as persons of ages 18-35 years. Linking the definitions to available facts\n\nWith that in mind, the closest backing to Mr Prinzo\u2019s figure (with reference to his youths and adults clause) is contained in the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) World Factbook estimate of 2015. It puts Nigeria\u2019s literacy rate at 59.6% with reference to ages \u201c15 and above\u201d. This means that approximately 26 million of ages 15-24 are literate. Since this age bracket is populated by approximately 40 million people, it, therefore, means an approximate of 14 million are illiterate \u2014 in this case, the Deputy Director\u2019s value is still low according to available facts.\n\nThat is: approximately 118 million Nigerians are literate. Thereby, leaving the remaining 80 million illiterate. This is way more than the 60 million asserted by the Deputy Director.\n\nOut-of-school children not 11 million\n\nOut-of-school children, according to the UN, are children aged between 6-11, who are yet to enroll in any formal education \u2014 excluding pre-primary education. Although, some of these children might have had pre-primary education but dropped out, or might enroll in the future or never enroll at all.\n\n\n\nSo it is these children Mr Prinzo puts their number at 11 million. But then, his figure, once again, isn\u2019t right. There is no available and verifiable source that suggests that Prinzo\u2019s claim is nearly true.\n\n\n\nIf he is wrong, what then what would have been the correct figure to quote? 13.2 million? No.\n\n\n\nThis figure (13.2 million) has been well reported in the media, and it has been a misconception ever since. This figure had been attributed to Ahmed Boboyi, the Executive Secretary of Universal Board of Education Commission (UBEC) who was represented by the Director of Social Mobilisation, Bello Kaigara, at the Northern Nigerian Traditional Rulers Conference on Out-of-School Children pre-conference briefing in Abuja last year October.\n\n\n\nKaigara referenced his figure on the Demographic Health Survey (DHS) which he claimed was conducted in 2015 by the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) and the Nigerian government. However, UNICEF has dissociated itself from ever conducting such survey.\n\n\n\nSo, even if Prinzo had quoted what is almost becoming common knowledge, he would still have been wrong. Nevertheless, here\u2019s what is right:\n\n\n\nThe Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS5) of 2016/2017 conducted by the NBS and UNICEF and published in 2018 shows that 9.1 million children are out-of-school. Unlike the UN definition of out-of-school children which doesn\u2019t include those in pre-school, this NBS survey defines out-of-school children as those out-of-school and those attending pre-school.\n\n\n\nIf this figure is to be reviewed to suit the UN definition of out-of-school children, it simply means Nigeria\u2019s out-of-school children would stand at 7.2 million. Hence, depending on the definition used, 9.1 million or 7.2 million would be correct, and what is even alarming is that it is still the highest anywhere in the world!\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the definition of \u201cyouths and adults\u201d as stated by Mr Prinzo is not clearcut, his figure contradicts reports from the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Bureau of Statistics; same as his out-of-school children figure of 11 million which cannot be accrued to any verifiable source.\n\n\n\nThe CIA figure for illiterate Nigerians aged 15 and above is 80 million. Likewise, the 2018 publication of the National Bureau of Statistics titled \u201cStatistical Report on Women and Men in Nigeria\u201d puts illiterate Nigerians within ages 15-24 at 14 million.\n\n\n\nEither ways, Prinzo\u2019s 60 million figure is in sharp contrast with the above figures.\n\n\n\nAlso, while Prinzo\u2019s 11 million claim of out-of-school children has no verifiable source, the widely reported 13.2 million said to have been made by UNICEF has been denied by the organization. Rather, according to NBS, the nation\u2019s out-of-school children are 9.1 million.\n\n\n\nMr James Prinzo\u2019s claims are therefore rated false.", "lang": "en"}
