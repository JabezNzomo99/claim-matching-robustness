Some users speculated that the plane had either crashed or been forced to make an emergency landing. The aircraft was, however, just being transported to its planned destination, where it will be converted into a hotel.\n\nOne Facebook post, which we\u2019ve archived here, has garnered more than 5,200 shares. The caption reads: \u201cHow does a plane crash in Limpopo Polokwane and it's not even breaking news?\u201d\n\nSocial media users had a bit of fun with the situation, with some joking that the pilot had to make an emergency landing after getting lost like this tweet, or that the pilot stopped because he was hungry.\n\nIn fact, the plane was where it was supposed to be -- en route to Hoedspruit, Limpopo.\n\nIf you look closely at posts about a plane \u201ccrashing\u201d on the highway, you can see that the plane is marked \u201cAerotel Hoedspruit Limpopo\u201d -- the name of a company that is converting a retired Boeing 737-200 into a 12-bed boutique hotel.\n\nAerotel Hoedspruit Limpopo\u2019s official Facebook page shows the aircraft, with its wings temporarily removed, had been on a slow journey to Hoedspruit, ready for the renovation.\n\nThe plane left Kempton Park, Gauteng on May 6, according to posts on the the company's Facebook page, and was sighted along the way as it was transported to Hoedspruit. In Boksburg...\n\nAnd in Polokwane ten days later, as claimed by the misleading posts\u2026\n\nAnd finally on arrival in Hoedspruit.\n\nAerotel spokeswoman Tracy Den Dunnen told AFP the plane being spotted in Polokwane was not a publicity stunt or intended to lead people to believe the plane had crash-landed -- but company staff did enjoy the humour of people thinking it was.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t really publicize the whole event,\u201d she said, although the company did brand \u201cthe fuselage (main body of the aircraft) for the exposure\u201d.\n\n\u201cInitially we thought it was going to be five days on the national road but it ended up being nine days,\u201d she added.\n\nAerotel says the plane-hotel is the first of its kind in South Africa and possibly the continent. The team aims to be up and running in September/October 2019.", "lang": "en"}
