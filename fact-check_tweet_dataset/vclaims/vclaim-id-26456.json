(Army has taken three petrol pumps into custody after they failed to provide petrol to the army.)\u201d \u2013 has been shared by many on social media. When Alt News searched for news reports on the alleged refusal by petrol pumps in Sulthan Bathery, Wayanad, we found none. This was the first hint at the claim\u2019s ingenuity. We contacted Bharat Petroleum, Sulthan Bathery and were told that the news is false and has been circulating on WhatsApp since the past few days. \u201cNo petrol pumps in Sulthan Bathery have refused to provide petrol to any vehicles of the army. The rescue operations are being conducted in Neppadi and not here,\u201d informed the supervisor. \u201cMoreover, army men don\u2019t suddenly show up to fill their vehicles with petrol. The information comes to us through the district collector so that we are prepared to provide the needed quantities. This is the protocol during disaster/ relief operations. Petrol pumps are directed to set aside reserves for government vehicles,\u201d he furthered, adding that the Wayanad District Petrol Dealers Association has filed a complaint with the Kerala government and the district police regarding the misinformation. A copy of the complaint was shared with Alt News. We also spoke to the supervisor at Geethanjali petrol pump in Sulthan Bathery and were given the same information as Bharat Petroleum. This was corroborated with the Secretary of the Wayanad District Petroleum Dealers Association Hijas Mohammed. Speaking with Alt News he said, \u201cWe have submitted written complaints to the police, the district administration, district collector and the district SP. The misinformation is quite viral. We enquired about rescue operations with our friends in the army who informed that they do not come to petrol pumps directly. The district administration is informed about the quantity, which is then shared with the petrol pumps for them to keep reserves ready. This is the procedure.\u201d A piece of misinformation was given credibility on social media after a few local media outlets published a false story. That the army seized petrol pumps after they were refused petrol and diesel in Suthan Bathery, Wayanad is fake news.", "lang": "en"}
