But official data shows it has increased in Scotland over the last year.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-33559", "url": "https://fullfact.org/election-2019/scottish-youth-unemployment/", "vclaim": "A Scottish government account has tweeted that Scotland\u2019s youth unemployment rate \u201cfell by 0.3 percentage points over the year\u201d.\n\nThis is looking at a dataset which is less reliable than the usual statistics on youth unemployment, which actually show the reverse happening.\n\nThe UK Statistics Authority has today asked the Scottish government to make it clear that the data it used is not considered reliable.\n\nThe data that the Scottish government refers to comes from an experimental release from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) which does not have the status of a \u201cNational Statistic\u201d. National Statistics are considered fully compliant with the Code of Practice for Statistics, whereas experimental statistics are still being assessed for their suitability and quality.\n\nThe experimental statistics say that youth unemployment (among those aged 16-24) in Scotland fell from 10% in July-September 2018, to 9.6% in the same period in 2019. That\u2019s what the Scottish government reports on.\n\nBut the ONS publishes another release, based on the Annual Population Survey of the UK, which does have National Statistics status. It\u2019s based on a larger sample size, which is a key reason why it\u2019s considered more reliable.\n\nThis data shows that the rate of youth unemployment in Scotland increased from 8.9% to 9.8% in the year to July 2019, compared to the year before.\n\nThe Scottish government told us it used the experimental data for its tweet because \u201cthose figures were more timely as they cover the period up until September 2019 and are published on a monthly basis\u201d, whereas the other figures \u201ccover the year up to June 2019 and were last published last month as a quarterly publication.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
