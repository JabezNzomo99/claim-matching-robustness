The younger Giuliani, according to the disclosure, earns $95,000 annually as special assistant to the president and associate director of the Office of Public Liaison. He was hired in 2017.\n\nThe meme, posted by the liberal social media network Occupy Democrats, likely gained traction in December 2019 because concurrent impeachment proceedings against Trump in the U.S. House of Representatives focused heavily on accusations of nepotism.\n\nTrump is facing impeachment over a whistleblower allegation that he attempted to extort the Ukrainian president by holding hostage crucial military aid while that country is embroiled in a war with Russia, in exchange for Ukraine producing damaging information on Trump\u2019s potential 2020 electoral rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe elder Giuliani has been accused of acting on Trump\u2019s behalf in the effort to pressure Ukrainian officials into producing an investigation against Biden and his son, Hunter. Neither Biden has been formally accused of criminal wrongdoing.\n\nTrump and his political allies have attempted to shift focus away from accusations against Trump by focusing instead on the fact that Hunter Biden gained a lucrative position on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company \u2014 a position they say he wouldn\u2019t have held without the influence of his father.\n\nRudy Giuliani addressed his son\u2019s employment in the Trump White House in a November 2019 interview with The Atlantic, saying it wasn\u2019t a typical \u201chire-my-kid\u201d situation, stating, \u201c[Andrew has] known the president since he was a baby. Now, did he know him in the first place because he was the mayor\u2019s son? Sure, but they also had a relationship independent of me.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
