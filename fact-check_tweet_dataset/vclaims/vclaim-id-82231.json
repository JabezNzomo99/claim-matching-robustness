But they need to get their facts straight when they do so. So how does Bush fare with four of the factoid he tossed out in a speech to voters in Iowa, as he tried to make the case that the District is the \u2018most prosperous place\u2019 in the United States?\n\nThis claim struck us as a little odd, given that a number of metro areas generally are often ranked higher than the Washington, D.C., area. The Bureau of Economic Analysis, a unit of the Commerce Department, says the Washington D.C., metro area ranks 10th, with a per capita personal income of $73,461 in 2013.\n\nBy contrast, Midland, Tex. ranks the highest, with income of $129,193, followed by cities such as San Jose, ($100,115), Bridgeport ($93,404), San Francisco (78,844), Seattle ($74,701) and Boston ($74,701). So the D.C. area is certainly near the top \u2014 the per capita figure for all 381 metro areas is $52,093 \u2014 but not the \u201chighest,\u201d as Bush claimed.\n\nThe Bush campaign, however, pointed to other BEA data at the state level, which at first glance appears to show the \u201cDistrict of Columbia\u201d with a 2014 per capita income of $76,532, higher than the state of Connecticut, with $62,467. But the District is not a state, and BEA officials note that this table includes the District but does not rank it. Connecticut is ranked as number 1. So it\u2019s incorrect for the Bush campaign to claim that this table shows that Washington, D.C., has the highest per capita income in the United States.\n\nThe key word here is \u201caverage.\u201d The Bush campaign pointed to a 2014 article quoting the D.C. chief financial officer as saying the average price will hit $813,600 in 2015. But a more recent 2015 forecast shows that the average price was $736,400 in 2014 and is projected to be $771,200 in 2015.\n\nThis is a strange quote when talking about a city with a 7.5 percent unemployment rate (compared to Iowa\u2019s 3.8 percent.) A Bush spokesman explained that \u201cthe point the Governor is trying to make is that D.C. is a boomtown where many more people are moving to find jobs off of Government largess.\u201d He noted from December 2007 (when the Great Recession started) to today, the District has had a 9 percent increase in the number of nonfarm employees, compared to 2 percent for the entire United States, according to the Bureau of labor Statistics.\n\nOkay, so Bush misspoke. We don\u2019t try to play gotcha here at The Fact Checker. But if Bush is talking about people with jobs in the federal government, then he\u2019s looking at the wrong set of data. The growth of federal jobs in this period was just about 8,000, or 4 percent, the BLS says. The real growth in jobs \u2013 about 63,000, or nearly 14 percent \u2013 came in private industry.\n\nThis is where Bush is on the strongest ground. His campaign cites a 2012 Congressional Budget Office report that estimated that \u201con average for workers at all levels of education, the cost of hourly benefits was 48 percent higher for federal civilian employees than for private-sector employees with certain similar observable characteristics.\u201d\n\nIf benefits are included, \u201coverall, the federal government paid 16 percent more in total compensation than it would have if average compensation had been comparable with that in the private sector, after accounting for certain observable characteristics of workers.\u201d\n\nWorkers with professional degrees tend to earn about 23 percent less than their private-sector counterparts, but they make up only 7 percent of federal workers, CBO said. Workers with bachelor\u2019s degrees tended to earn about the same as private sector workers, but workers with no more than a high school degree tended to earn about 21 percent more, on average.\n\nBush would have done better if he had not gotten off-track with some of his specifics. The Washington area does have one of the highest per capita income levels, but not the highest. Meanwhile, the District has a relatively high unemployment rate, while the growth in jobs has been in the private sector, not in the federal government. He\u2019s right that home prices are high, if not quite $800,000. And the CBO confirms that federal salaries are much higher, on average, compared to private-sector workers.", "lang": "en"}
