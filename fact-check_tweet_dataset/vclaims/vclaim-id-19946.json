What happened? We were one of the fastest growing nations in the G7 in that time.\u201d \u201cDavid... just this week it\u2019s been revealed that we have plummeted as a country from the fastest-growing economy amongst developed economies to the slowest in a three-month period\u201d\n\nMr Davis\u2019s basic point is correct. The Treasury\u2019s forecasts for the impact of a vote to leave didn\u2019t reflect how the economy performed after the vote to leave the EU. He\u2019s not correct on the specific timings, although he may have just mis-spoken.\n\nHM Treasury, the department which oversees government spending, forecast last year that a vote to leave the EU would result in a year-long recession, beginning in the third quarter of 2016.\n\nBut in the third quarter of 2016 the UK was the third fastest-growing economy in the in the G7, a group of \u2018major advanced economies\u2019. In the fourth quarter it grew the fastest. That ran counter to the expectations of most economic forecasts made before the referendum.\n\nThen, as Mr Clegg points out, in the first three months of this year the UK dropped in the rankings. It joined Italy and the USA as one of the three slowest-growing economies in the same group\u2014not the single slowest as Nick Clegg says. The Office for National Statistics hasn\u2019t published estimates for months after that yet.\n\nSo the debate now isn\u2019t about whether the Treasury\u2019s forecasts were a bad guide to what happened immediately after the vote (they were) but whether it was mainly the timing they got wrong.\n\nA survey of professional economists run by the Financial Times in January 2017 found that the majority weren\u2019t reassured by the apparently solid performance of the UK economy since the vote to leave the EU. Some took this view despite conceding that many of the short-term forecasts had been overly pessimistic.", "lang": "en"}
