This was a curious editorial decision, as the 15-year-old in question was 22 in 2019, and the more sensational claims he had made years ago had been significantly tempered \u2014 facts Andraka himself has acknowledged but that did not make their way into the Epoch Times story.\n\nFirst, here\u2019s what the story gets right. As a 15-year-old, Jack Andraka gained fame for prototyping a potential test for pancreatic cancer that was purportedly quicker and cheaper than existing methods, for which he was awarded the grand prize at the 2012 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. In 2014, then-Forbes healthcare reporter (and current medical reporter at STAT) Matthew Herper described the concept this way:\n\nHerper, in his capacity as the author of that year\u2019s Forbes 30 under 30 list of promising young scientists, had reviewed a draft of a paper Andraka had written about his test along with six other expert reviewers. In a piece titled \u201cWhy Biotech Whiz Kid Jack Andraka Is Not On The Forbes 30 Under 30 List,\u201d he relayed the concerns of five anonymous reviewers and one non-anonymous reviewer: Harvard DNA sequencing pioneer George Church. Church concluded that many of the claims \u201cmay not hold up, or at least require more work to be proven.\u201d\n\nOthers, like the pancreatic cancer researcher who discovered mesothelin in the first place, Ira Paston, had gone further. In a 2015 Sydney Morning Herald piece, Paston stated that the method Andraka proposed \u201cmakes no scientific sense,\u201d and that Paston didn\u2019t \u201cknow anybody in the scientific community who believes his findings.\u201d\n\nAndraka, for his part, has also recognized that the problem is more complex than his earlier statements might have suggested. In an email to Herper in 2014, Andraka wrote:\n\nHere we get into the weeds of the claims made (most recently) by The Epoch Times, but which form the basis of other continually recurring clickbait stories.\n\n\u201c168 times faster, 26,000 times less expensive, and 400 times more sensitive\u201d\n\nIn a 2012 TEDx Talk, among other places, Andraka stated that his test was \u201c168 times faster, 26,000 times less expensive, and 400 times more sensitive.\u201d Any reporting citing these numbers is merely repeating, uncritically, claims which misrepresent the time and cost of existing technology. One of the few existing methods for pancreatic cancer detection is via ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) tests. Specifically, ELISA tests that identify the presence of a chemical known as CA 19-9 can be evidence of tumors in some cases of pancreatic cancer.\n\nAccording to Church, Andraka\u2019s time comparison overstates the amount of time such ELISA tests take. The comparison Andraka used was 14 hours. ELISA, however, is fairly quick these days. A modern CA 19-9 ELISA panel, for example, takes 1.5 hours to run. Suggesting it takes 14 hours inflates significantly the speed comparison in favor of Andraka\u2019s test.\n\nChurch also stated that the cost comparison employed by Andraka was flawed because it compared only the manufacturing costs on his invention\u2019s side but included profit and overhead on the ELISA test side:\n\nAs for sensitivity, Church argued that the results presented by Andraka varied too much to say anything about sensitivity (a measure that gets at potential false positives).\n\nAndraka was able to spend six months in the lab of a Johns Hopkins Medical Center researcher where he tested his test using blood from mice who had pancreatic cancer compared to those who didn\u2019t. Such tests, even if they produced promising results, would not be the same as demonstrating efficacy as a diagnostic tool for pancreatic cancer in humans.\n\nOutside of accuracy \u2014 i.e., the ability to correctly identify humans with pancreatic cancer \u2014 the early detection of the disease was also central to the project, something Andraka would not have been able to test directly for his work at Hopkins. Ira Pastan, the National Cancer Institutes researcher who discovered mesothelin, the biomarker used in Andraka\u2019s test, told The Sydney Morning Herald that the protein is not actually elevated in the blood in early pancreatic cancer patients and thus could not be indicative of the early stages of the disease. Other scientific studies support Pastan\u2019s objection.\n\nA 2013 study into the diagnostic efficacy of mesothelin on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (a form of pancreatic cancer) concluded that the biomarker was \u201ca weak diagnostic classifier on its own\u201d but may be of use as part of a larger panel test. Mesothelin is also present in cases of other cancers as well, including \u201cmalignant mesothelioma and \u2026 ovarian, and lung adenocarcinomas. In a 2015 statement provided to Sydney Morning Herald reporter Nick Bryant by John Hopkins University, the institution made clear the results were far too preliminary to declare such accuracy or to speculate on its future success:\n\n\u201c[Andraka] currently also holds the international patent on the device\u201d\n\nAndraka does not hold an international patent on his device. Although he applied for one in 2012, that application was ultimately denied based on lacking an \u201cinventive step.\u201d\n\nAll told, media outlets like The Epoch Times continue to run with an out-of-date and highly clickable fairytale that has not been accurate since at least 2014. Andraka himself acknowledges the shortcomings of his earlier scientific pronouncements and is thankful for the criticism he has received, telling (for example) The Sydney Morning Herald in 2015 that \u201cI really appreciate their concerns because their concerns made my project better. It was definitely a learning curve.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
