Through his Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, he gave away $4.78 billion in 2017 and $138 million in 2018, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy.\n\nBut the founder of Microsoft won\u2019t just send you $500,000 just for reaching out to him on social media, as a post now circulating on Facebook says.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe post purports to come from \"Bill Gate Foundation\" (yes, the post misspelled his name) and features a photograph of Gates helping provide health care to a family that appears to be from Africa, a longtime mission of Gates\u2019 (real) foundation.\n\nThe post repeats the misspelling in the text:\n\n\"MY NAME IS BILL GATE, I AM THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD\n\n\"Tell me one thing you need from me, and i will do it for you\n\n\"Use the (SEND MESSAGE) button below and send me a message today, and I will surprise you..\n\nOne tipoff that the post is fake is that it does not come from the genuine Gates Foundation Facebook page, which has a blue-checkmark verification. Social media experts will remind users to always be skeptical with posts claiming to be from celebrities but lack a verified status.\n\nWe also checked with a representative of the real foundation, and they confirmed to us via email that the post did not come from them. The foundation has struggled with scammers trading on their name for years.\n\nThe post does not come from Bill Gates\u2019 foundation, so don\u2019t expect any gifts to follow. We rate the post Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
