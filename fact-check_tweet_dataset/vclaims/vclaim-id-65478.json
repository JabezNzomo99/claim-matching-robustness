A spokeswoman for Walmart confirmed \u201ccash is welcome\u201d at all stores.\n\nThe Federal Reserve states on its website that \u201cbusiness and bank closures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly disrupted the supply chain and normal circulation patterns for U.S. coins.\u201d That slowed pace of circulation has resulted in an ongoing nationwide coin shortage, according to USA Today.\n\nBusinesses across the country have adjusted their operations to deal with the national coin shortage. A viral Facebook post alleges that Walmart stopped accepting cash payments entirely starting July 13.\n\n\u201cJust so you guys know,\u201d the July 12 post reads. \u201cStarting tomorrow Walmart is card only. No cash at all.\u201d (RELATED: Did Walmart Tweet, \u2018We Won\u2019t Be Rebuilding Walmarts In Cities Without Police\u2019?)\n\nBut, as multiple Facebook users pointed out in the comments, the claim doesn\u2019t hold up. The Daily Caller News Foundation didn\u2019t find any media reports about Walmart banning cash payments. Tricia Moriarty, a Walmart spokeswoman, told the DCNF that cash is \u201cwelcome at all of our stores.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike most retailers, we\u2019re experiencing the effects of the nationwide coin shortage,\u201d Moriarty said in an email to the DCNF. \u201cWe\u2019re asking customers to pay with card or use correct change when possible if they need to pay with cash. Cash is welcome at all of our stores.\u201d\n\nMoriarty said that some self-checkout registers at Walmarts have been converted to only accept cards and that customers can also \u201cdonate their change to charity.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the nationwide coin shortage has sparked an unfounded claim on social media. On July 24, The Associated Press debunked a viral conspiracy theory that the coin shortage was a hoax created by the federal government to usher the U.S. into a cashless society.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
