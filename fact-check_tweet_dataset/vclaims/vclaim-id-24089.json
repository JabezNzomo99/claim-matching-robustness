The images are being used in a misleading context; they have been taken from old reports about unrelated protests in India and Pakistan, not Kashmir.\n\nThe photo collage was published in this Facebook post on June 17, 2016, where it has been shared more than 22,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe Hindi-language caption translates to English as: \u201cIn Kashmir, a cow is slaughtered on the top of the Indian tricolour. Now the Indian leaders will express their sorrow only. Brothers, if you have had the milk of holy cow mother, then swear on that cow milk, you have to spread this photo everywhere in India to pay the debt of that cow milk. And yes only a fundamentalist Hindu will share this.\u201d\n\nThe same photo collage was shared on Facebook here and Twitter here with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false: all four images in the photo collage have been taken from separate incidents of clashes between activists and policemen in India and Pakistan.\n\nA reverse image search on Google for the top left image in the photo collage found the photo in this report published on the website of People\u2019s Daily, a newspaper in China, on July 13, 2011.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the image in the misleading post highlighted in red (L) and the image on the People\u2019s Daily website (R):\n\nThe photo is credited to a stringer for Chinese state media Xinhua, and the caption says it was taken in Agartala, capital of Tripura, a northeast Indian state.\n\nThe caption states; \u201cAn injured Indian policeman gesturing after he was attacked by activists of India's ruling Congress party in Agartala, on July 11, 2011. One person was killed and 30 others including 11 security personnel were injured in a clash between activists of Congress party and police on Monday in Agartala, according to local news reports. (Xinhua/Stringer)\u201d.\n\nThe same incident was reported in this article published by Indian newspaper the Shillong Times on July 12, 2011.\n\nAnother reverse image search on Google for the bottom left picture of the photo collage found the same image published here on June 16, 2014 in the photo gallery for Amar Ujala\u2019s website, a Hindi-language newspaper in India.\n\nThe caption translates to English as: \"Police DIG VS Meena injured badly in stone pelting protest by an angry mob.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the image in the misleading post highlighted in red (L) and original image published on Amar Ujala\u2019s website (R):\n\nThis report states the photo was taken in protests in Firozabad in Uttar Pradesh, India in June 2014.\n\nThis is another report about the incident by the Press Trust of India news agency, published on the English-language newspaper The Times of India\u2019s website on June 16, 2014.\n\nThe report states: \"Violent protests broke out on Monday in which several persons, including a DIG of police, were injured following the killing of two police constables by unidentified assailants.\"\n\nAnother reverse image search on Google for the image on the top right in the misleading post found a corresponding image published here on the AFP Forum.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the image in the misleading post (L) with the AFP photo (R):\n\nThe caption states in part: \u201cPakistani activists from the banned charity organisation Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) burn an Indian flag during a protest in Quetta on March 23, 2015.\u201d\n\nHowever, the slaughtered cow cannot be seen in the AFP picture. AFP photographer Banaras Khan, based in Quetta, told AFP that it had been cropped out of the original edit.\n\nHe told AFP by WhatsApp message on July 4, 2019: \"Yes a cow was slaughtered during the protest, I clearly remember that. It got cropped out somehow when the photo was finally published.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading post (L) with the AFP photo (R) with corresponding features circled in red:\n\nThe same image was published by Getty Images here on March 23, 2015.\n\nAnother Google reverse image search for the fourth picture on the bottom right of the collage found a corresponding photo of the same police officers published here on Indian news site \u2018Prahar News Portal\u2019, on June 4, 2015.\n\nThe report\u2019s first line states: \u201cAngry Sikh protesters during a clash with police after they removed a poster of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale at Rani Bagh (sic) near the airport in Jammu on Thursday.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the fourth image in the misleading post (L) and the photo published by Prahar News Portal (R):\n\nThis article published on June 15, 2015, by Hindi-language newspaper Amar Ujala reports on the same incident on June 4, 2015.\n\nIt states clashes erupted between cops and a group of about 2,000 Sikh youth in Jammu city in India. It states the demonstrators were protesting against the removal of posters of slain Khalistani leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale.", "lang": "en"}
