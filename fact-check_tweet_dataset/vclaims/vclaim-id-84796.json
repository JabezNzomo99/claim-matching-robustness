We\u2019re not trying to kick a former candidate when he\u2019s down (Rubio dropped out of the presidential race after a poor showing in the March 15 Florida primary), but he is still a sitting senator who was involved in crafting legislation to overhaul immigration laws.\n\nEmployers trying to temporarily hire non-immigrant workers have to file a Labor Condition Application with the Department of Labor. In the application, the employers have to attest that they met or will meet several requirements (including wages and working conditions). These requirements are designed to protect U.S. workers.\n\nThere is a \u201cno displacement\u201d requirement and a recruiting requirement, as Rubio said. But these requirements apply to \u201cH-1B dependent\u201d employers that have a large number of H-1B workers (for example, a company of 51 or more full-time employees is considered H-1B-dependent if 15 percent or more of its workforce are H-1B workers). Employers that are not deemed H-1B-dependent are not subject to this requirement.\n\nThe majority of H-1B workers are in computer-related occupations. The median salary H-1B recipients in fiscal 2014 was $75,000 and 55 percent of them had degrees higher than a bachelor\u2019s. Nearly 72 percent of all workers who were granted continuing or initial employment with H-1B visas in fiscal 2014 were 25 to 34 years old.\n\nHere\u2019s an overarching caveat: Employers have to attest \u2014 not prove \u2014 that they met the displacement and recruitment requirements. The law only requires the labor secretary to review the application for \u201ccompleteness and obvious inaccuracies,\u201d rather than to make sure the employer actually met the requirements. Critics call this attestation process a loophole widely abused by dependent employers.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly how many H-1B employers are deemed H-1B-dependent. Neither the Labor Department nor Citizenship and Immigration Services had a figure readily available. Several immigration and employment law experts said H-1B-dependent companies comprise a small percentage of all employers in the country \u2014 but comprise a large portion of all employers that hire H-1B workers. These generally are information technology services firms.\n\nThe additional requirements for H-1B-dependent employers were created to prevent abuse by those who use the program the most, but it is neither protecting American workers nor the H-1B workers, according to Ron Hira, an associate professor at Howard University and an expert on the H-1B program.\n\nPrevious attempts to test the law have shown that it is, indeed, legal to replace American workers, experts said. For example, in 2015, 10 senators requested the Department of Labor, Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security to investigate the hiring of large number of H-1B workers to replace American workers by a California company. But the agencies declined or ended their investigation with no charges.\n\nThe Labor Department investigated HCL America, Inc., the contractor for Disney, and found that the company is H-1B-dependent, a department spokesperson said. They were found to have only hired H-1B- exempt workers, earning more than $60,000 a year or having a master\u2019s degree. So the displacement and recruitment provisions do not apply to any of those workers, and no violations were found, the spokesperson said.\n\nRubio makes a blanket statement that makes it seem like a no-displacement and a recruiting requirement are the law and practice of the H-1B program. Technically, those requirements exist. But they only apply to companies that hire a large number of H-1B workers and are deemed \u201cdependent\u201d on the program. And even then, the companies can pay the workers more than $60,000 or hire people who have master\u2019s or higher degrees to get around the requirements.\n\nRubio inaccurately portrays these requirements in law. As a former member of the Gang of Eight, Rubio really should know better than to make a sloppy statement like this. We bid him farewell from the presidential campaign with Three Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
