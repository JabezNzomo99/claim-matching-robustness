The story opened:\n\nNews reports have confirmed that actor Kirk Douglas died of natural causes late this afternoon, Los Angeles coroners office reported. This was just 4 days before he would have turned 101 years old. Family released a statement saying he \"went comfortably and was in no pain\" and \"lived a long and prosperous life that people only dream of.\"\n\nThe rest of the article is mostly cribbed together from the Wikipedia page of Kirk Douglas, with the occasional \"is\" replaced by a \"was\".\n\nNo reliable news outlets have confirmed the \"news\", not even two days after his supposed death on December 5th. On those grounds alone it is safe to say this is fake news.\n\nIn addition to that ActionNews3 is a know fake news website that is part of a network of similar sites posting false stories all hosted on the same IP address (67.227.229.104). Notorious other sites in the network seem to include:\n\nEarlier the site ran death hoaxes about Morgan Freeman, Rob Kardashian and Hugh Heffner (before he really died).\n\nSo don't fall for this one either and report it when you see it online (and warn your friends if you see them sharing it).", "lang": "en"}
