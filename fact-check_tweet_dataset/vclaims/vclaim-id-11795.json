{"title": "HOAX: Kenyan gov't 'erects Duterte statue'", "subtitle": "The image of the supposed statue used in the claim is actually that of former president Ferdinand Marcos in Ilocos Norte", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "Dec 14, 2018 4:55 PM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-11795", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/hoax-kenyan-government-builds-duterte-statue", "vclaim": "Kenya President Uhuru Kenyatta reportedly said, \u201cToday I am launching this monument, it will be an encouragement to me, I will be looking at it and direct my focus on this drug barons the way Duterte did, I will win this war.\u201d\n\nThe claim was posted on afrikan-daily.com and kenya-times.com on December 12. The first website has had more engagement on Facebook, as it was shared to a pro-Duterte page and a pro-Marcos group. Combined, the two articles have a total of at least 1,000 interactions and 75,800 followers.\n\nThe photo used in the claim features the statue of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos located in Sarrat, Ilocos Norte. It was grabbed from an article by the Philippine Daily Inquirer in November 2016.\n\nAs for the launch of the anti-drug campaign where Kenyatta supposedly made the statement, there are no additional details included in the article about where the said event was held.\n\nAn international conference on drug demand reduction organized by the National Authority for the Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse (Nacada) is happening in Kenya from December 10 to 14. However, President Kenyatta is not among the keynote speakers in the event.\n\nKenyatta recently made a speech during their Jamhuri Day celebration on December 12, but there was no mention of Duterte nor the statue. Also, a search for the term \"Duterte\" on the Kenya presidency's official website does not yield any result.\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
