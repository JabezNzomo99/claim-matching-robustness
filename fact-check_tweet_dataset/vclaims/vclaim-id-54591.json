The two agreed on the need to maintain a ceasefire in Libya and avoid escalation between the forces fighting for control over the North African country, reports said.\n\n\u201cPresident El-Sisi confirmed Egypt's unwavering strategic position on Libya, which aimed at restoring stability in the country, preserving its national institutions, and preventing further deterioration in Libya\u2019s security situation via curbing illegal foreign interference in the Libyan issue,\u201d a readout published on the Egyptian president\u2019s website said.\n\nAs al-Sisi spoke with Trump, Egypt\u2019s parliament voted \u2013 secretly, according to local media \u2013 to authorize the president to send the nation\u2019s military into Libya.\n\nAl-Sisi had requested the parliamentary approval less than week earlier after meeting with the leaders of Libya\u2019s eastern tribes and declaring that Egypt might intervene in that country militarily \u201cto face terrorism\u201d and \u201cprotect national security.\u201d\n\nSuch a military move by Egypt would have major implications - not only for Libya, but for countries backing the warring sides there.\n\nIn western Libya, the Government of National Accord (GNA), which is recognized by the United Nations, controls Libya\u2019s capital, Tripoli; most of the nation\u2019s financial institutions, including the Central Bank; and the National Oil Corporation (NOC). Turkey and Qatar are among GNA\u2019s main supporters.\n\nIn eastern Libya, along Egypt\u2019s western border, the House of Representatives (HOR) and the Libyan National Army (LNA), led by warlord Khalifa Haftar, control critical oil infrastructure and logistic hubs. Among Haftar\u2019s supporters are Egypt, France, Russia and Saudi Arabia.\n\nGiven the context, what constitutes \u201cillegal foreign interference\u201d is open to wide interpretation.\n\nTurkey\u2019s heavy military presence in Libya makes Egypt\u2019s intervention more likely. According to some analysts, such an escalation would make Libya \u201cthe next global flash point.\u201d\n\nTurkey has said its next target is the city of Sirte, which is the site of Libya\u2019s largest oil deposits and is now controlled by the LNA, unless Haftar agrees to negotiate and eventually step down.\n\nEgypt has responded by calling Sirte a \u201cred line,\u201d the crossing of which will prompt military intervention.\n\nU.S. diplomats and officials have for years called for a political solution to the conflict in Libya. According to a recent report by the U.S. Congressional Research, the top U.S. priority in Libya is counterterrorism.", "lang": "en"}
