This article is a fact check of these claims.\n\nWhat is PAHAL?\n\n The annual report (2017-18) of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG) states that \u2018Government of India has launched Direct Benefit Transfer for LPG consumer (DBTL) scheme namely, PAHAL, in 54 districts of the country in November 2014 and as of January 2018, 19.43 Crore LPG consumers have joined the scheme. The scheme aims to rationalise subsidies based on approach to cut subsidy leakages, but not subsidies themselves. LPG consumers who join the PAHAL scheme, will get the LPG cylinders at non-subsidised price and receive LPG subsidy (as per their entitlement) directly into their bank accounts\u2019.\n\nIn a previous annual report (2014-15) of the MoPNG, it is stated that \u2018in compliance with the vision 2015 and to spread LPG distribution network in rural areas and uncovered areas, Rajiv Gandhi Gramin LPG Vitaran Yojana (RGGLVY) for establishing small size LPG distribution agencies was launched in October 2009. As on 31st December 2014, 4058 Nos. of RGGLVs have been commissioned by OMCs\u2019.\n\nGoing back even further, the annual report (2013-14) of the MoPNG states that, \u2018effective April 2002, the Government decided to provide subsidy on sale of PDS kerosene and domestic LPG at specified flat rates under the Budget. To administer these budgetary subsidies, the Government formulated two schemes viz. \u2018PDS Kerosene and Domestic LPG Subsidy Scheme 2002\u2019 and \u2018Freight Subsidy (For Far Flung Areas) Scheme 2002\u2019. Under these schemes it was decided that subsidy on PDS Kerosene and Domestic LPG will be phased out in 3-5 years\u2019.\n\nAccording to the PAHAL website, \u2018the PAHAL (DBTL) scheme was earlier launched in June 2013 and finally covered 291 districts. It required the consumer to mandatorily have an Aadhaar number for availing LPG Subsidy. The government has comprehensively reviewed the scheme and after examining the difficulties faced by the consumer substantively modified the scheme prior to launch in 2014. The modified scheme has been re-launched in 54 districts in November 2014 in the 1st Phase and rest of the country in January 2015\u2019.\n\nIt is thus, important to note that the scheme in its present form was launched in 2014 but LPG subsidy has existed long before that. It can also be understood that the DBT for LPG consumers (DBTL) was conceived and the pilot launched during the UPA-2.\n\nIs PAHAL the world\u2019s largest cash transfer program? \n\n The first claim is that \u2018PAHAL is the world\u2019s largest cash transfer program with over 20.14 crore beneficiaries receiving 69,815 crore rupees\u2019.\n\nAn answer in Lok Sabha in December 2018 states that \u2018after implementation of PAHAL Scheme, the LPG consumers, who have joined the Scheme, purchase the LPG cylinders at non-subsidised price and receive LPG subsidy (as per their entitlement) directly in their registered bank account. As of December 2018, a total of 23.11 crore consumers have joined the Scheme in the country\u2019.\n\nThe annual report (2017-18) of the MoPNG states that, \u2018as of December 2017, more than 19.43 crore LPG consumers have joined the PAHAL Scheme. So far, more than Rs. 62,630 crore have been transferred into the bank accounts of consumers\u2019. As per a recent answer in the Lok Sabha in February 2019, a total of Rs. 1.03 lakh crore have been transferred under PAHAL to a total of 23.81 crore registered LPG consumers.\n\nThe annual report also states that, \u2018PAHAL has entered into Guinness book of World record being largest Direct Benefit Transfer scheme\u2019. The website of Guinness World Records also confirms this.\n\nHave more than 3 crore rupees directly transferred to beneficiaries?\n\n The second claim is that \u20183,65,996 crore rupees directly transferred into bank account of beneficiaries of 431 schemes\u2019.\n\nA response in Lok Sabha stated that \u2018as of 26th December 2018, 434 schemes of 56 Ministries/Departments have been on boarded on the DBT portal. DBT schemes are not limited to the subsidy but also includes others benefits such as scholarships, pension, wages and other social benefits under various Centrally Sponsored Schemes and Central Sector Schemes\u2019.\n\nThe same response also shows that a total of 5,63,896.8 crore rupees have been transferred to beneficiaries, out of which 4,88,680.2 crore rupees have been in cash (the rest of the amount has been in kind). Since the response was given after the claim was made, the numbers are higher. Addition of schemes could have also increased the amounts. On the other hand, the DBT portal, states that 6,30,689 Crore rupees have been transferred under the DBT scheme as on 01st March 2019.\n\nAnother response in Lok Sabha in April 2013 states that \u2018the amount of funds transfer to beneficiaries for the identified schemes under DBT from 1st January to 31st March 2013 through APB was Rs. 22.9 crore and through non-APB was Rs. 57.1 crore\u2019. This only shows that DBT for other schemes was also conceived and piloted during the UPA-2.\n\nThis story is part of a larger series on the 4-years of the Modi government.
