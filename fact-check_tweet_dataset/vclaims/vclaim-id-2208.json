Terrible situation for the citizens and society. Hope they can recover fast!\" wrote another Twitter user with the handle @lauslahti.\n\nNone of the users identified whether the image was supposed to show Houston\u2019s George Bush Intercontinental Airport or the smaller William P. Hobby Airport, but it\u2019s neither. The image is a fake.\n\nWhile it does show an airport \u2014 New York\u2019s LaGuardia Airport in Queens \u2014 it\u2019s actually a digitally manipulated photo that was used to show the effects of sea-level rise. A 2013 article on ClimateCentral.org credited the image to an artist named Nickolay Lamm, saying it was made to illustrate what a 25-foot increase in sea level would look like at LaGuardia. (There are other images showing the change at 5 feet and 12 feet.)\n\nBoth of Houston\u2019s major airports were shut down by the storm, canceling thousands of flights over several days. Bush and Hobby airports were both expected to resume flights by Aug. 29.\n\nAn Aug. 27 tweet from Houston\u2019s ABC affiliate said, \"[email protected] says about 500 people are trapped. A friend shared these pics of a flooded runway and street with @FotiABC13 #HoustonFlood\" and included photos.\n\nOther tweets, including this one from the local CBS affiliate on Aug. 26, showed flooding near Bush.\n\nBut the photograph popping up across the Internet isn\u2019t a true representation of the disaster.
