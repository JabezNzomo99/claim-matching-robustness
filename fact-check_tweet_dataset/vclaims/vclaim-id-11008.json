It is the most-watched television program in Russia and the former Soviet countries.\n\nOn Saturday, October 26, much of the program\u2019s airtime was dedicated to the United States, as is usually the case with Vremya.\n\nKleimyonov first informed his viewers of the \u201cmail bomb\u201d incident, suggesting that if one party in the U.S. is \u201ctotally eliminated\u201d only one political party will remain. \u201cWe already have a name and a mascot for it,\u201d Kleimyonov said, pointing to the screen behind him, where there was a doctored picture with \u201cUnited America\u201d written over the two symbols of the main U.S. political parties, the donkey and the elephant, photo-shopped as one monstrous hybrid.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get it wrong, it\u2019s not a donkey suffering from constipation. It's a donkelephant, or whatever the American people decide to call it in a free democratic vote without any of our interference,\u201d Kleimyonov said before switching to the next topic \u2013 also concerning the United States.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been announced that Megyn Kelly\u2019s program, our favorite American TV anchor, is being taken off the air,\u201d he said. The NBC action followed an outcry over Kelly\u2019s racially insensitive comments on her program. After speculating about the insignificance of the race issue, he proposed a \u201chealing recipe\u201d for Kelly.\n\n\u201cDear, dear Megyn, spit on your bosses, just spit and come to us, to Russia, to the hero-city of Moscow,\u201d Kleimyonov proposed, looking at an image of Megyn Kelly doctored into the studio interior sitting next to him.\n\nAddressing the American journalist, Kleimyonov used the informal \u201cty\u201d for \u201cyou,\u201d which in Russia, is used only with friends and family, instead of the formal \u201cvy.\u201d The choice between \u201cty\u201d and \u201cvy\u201d is also a way of showing people their position compared to yours \u2013 younger or less important.\n\nKleimyonov suggested that Kelly co-host his program, promising her \u201cthe love of millions of our men and the envy of millions of women.\u201d\n\nThe offer was followed with a report headlined \u201cExtinguishing a star,\u201d in which Channel One\u2019s correspondent in the U.S., Zhanna Agalakova, commented on Megyn Kelly and the race issue in the U.S.\n\n\u201cSmart and beautiful, she now is an outcast and a white crow \u2013 or, as Americans say a black sheep,\u201d Agalakova said at the start of her report.\n\nAfter a brief review of the scandal that cost Kelly her job with NBC, Agalakova then switched to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom Kelly interviewed in 2017. Archived video footage showed Kelly speaking with Agalakova about Putin, with Kelly stating: \u201cI think he likes to be challenged. He is a very smart man. I couldn\u2019t ask him any questions to which he did not know the answers.\u201d That was followed by footage of the Russian president and Kelly chatting and smiling at each other.\n\nThe footage was seemingly structured in way designed to convince Russians that \u201cthe true reason\u201d behind NBC\u2019s decision to terminate a contract with Kelly was, as Vremya host Kleimyonov put it, \u201cour love for her.\u201d\n\nThat claim is false: NBC said the anchor would no longer host the \u201cMegyn Kelly Today\u201d after she made racially insensitive comments during the October 25 edition of her show.\n\nKelly is widely quoted as questioning, with a panel, what actions would be considered racist: \"Truly, you do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on blackface for Halloween, or a black person who put on whiteface for Halloween. When I was a kid, it was OK as long as you were dressing up as, like, a character,\u201d Kelly is quoted as saying on October 23.\n\nWhile Kelly's remarks caused outrage, neither her critics nor NBC mentioned her stance toward Russia. Kelly has since apologized for the racially-tinged comments.\n\nVremya is Russia\u2019s flagship news show. Its name and prime-time slot at 9 p.m. daily have remained unchanged since it first went on the air in the Soviet Union in 1958.\n\nWhen Vremya celebrated its 50-year anniversary On January 1, 2018, President Putin came to the studio for a special interview with Kleimyonov. Putin said Vremya\u2019s anniversary was a national holiday and called the program a \u201cleader of information programs\u201d in Russia and abroad.", "lang": "en"}
