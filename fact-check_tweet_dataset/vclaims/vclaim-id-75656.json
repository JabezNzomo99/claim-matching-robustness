Ajmer Sharif Dargah is a shrine of sufi saint, Moinuddin Chishti located at Ajmer, Rajasthan\n\nIn the video, Modi can be seen meeting with Sayed Fakhar Kazmi Chisty who ties a 'safa' or 'pagri' (headgear) for the prime minister and presents him with mementos including what appears to be a religious text.\n\nHowever, some Twitter users decided to give it a nefarious spin linking it to the upcoming election in Gujarat.\n\nAam Aadmi Party (AAP) spokesperson Sanjay Singh quoted the above tweet and in a sarcastic dig thanked the prime minister for letting Muslim religious leaders tie him a pagri but claimed that the meeting took place behind closed doors, implying the meeting was secret. At the time of writing this story Singh's tweet received over 1200 Likes and over 570 retweets.\n\nThe meeting with the delegation from Ajmer Sharif took place on May 2nd, 2016 and was not a secret meeting. In fact both the prime minister and PIB (Press Information Bureau) tweeted about it in 2016.\n\nPictures from the meeting have also been shared by pmindia.gov.in a website that is run by the prime minister's office.", "lang": "en"}
