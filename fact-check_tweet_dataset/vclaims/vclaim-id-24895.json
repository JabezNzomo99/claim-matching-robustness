But the photographer\u2019s husband, the singer Timi Dakolo, has rejected that claim and others as false. The couple are continuing to pursue legal action against Fatoyinbo.\n\nIn a July 9 report which we\u2019ve archived here, Exclusive103.com -- a website with a history of sharing false information -- claims that Busola Dakolo said she was paid by two churches to accuse Fatoyinbo, the senior pastor of the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA), of rape.\n\nThe report has been shared nearly 2,000 times on Facebook, according to social media analysis tool CrowdTangle.\n\nThe headline reads: \u201cI was paid by two churches to accuse Biodun Fatoyinbo of rape, he didn\u2019t rape me \u2013 Busola Dakolo breaks down in tears and apologized\u201d.\n\nThe body of the report does not actually provide any further information to support the attention-grabbing claim made in the headline. It contains just two paragraphs of text -- both of them linking to a September 2018 CNN article about a completely separate case, that of the sexual assault allegations against US Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. The second paragraph actually uses quotes from Kavanaugh\u2019s accuser Christine Blasey Ford as if they were words from Dakolo.\n\nDakolo made the explosive allegation against Fatoyinbo in this interview in June 2019, alleging that the pastor had raped her two decades earlier. Following her testimony, at least one other woman has come forward accusing the pastor of rape. Fatoyinbo has since stepped aside from the pulpit -- and has denied all allegations levelled against him by Dakolo.\n\nSome sections of social media in Nigeria have criticised her for speaking up. Many others have expressed support, however, and there have been protests against Fatoyinbo at COZA churches in Lagos and Abuja.\n\nThe rape accusation has fuelled other claims about the Dakolos\n\nThe Exclusive103.com report is not the only unsubstantiated claim that has appeared online since Dakolo\u2019s accusation against the pastor went viral.\n\nOther reports and Facebook posts, some of which we\u2019ve archived here, here, here, say that Timi Dakolo had previously said his wife was a virgin when they got married in 2012 -- undermining the claim that she had been raped as a teenager.\n\nSome of the posts say Timi Dakolo made these comments in an interview with Hip TV.\n\nWhile the singer has often appeared on the TV station over the years -- including this interview where he talked about his wife -- we were unable to find any Hip TV video where he made the supposed comments about her virginity.\n\nPosts criticising the Dakolos have also claimed that they got married in a COZA church.\n\nThe Dakolos appeared at a press conference in Lagos on July 20, where Timi Dakolo dismissed the various claims circulating about the couple as \u201cdistractions\u201d from the seriousness of his wife\u2019s rape allegation.\n\nBusola Dakolo did not speak at the press conference. Her husband said he was not giving her the microphone because he did not want people to see her cry.\n\nTimi Dakolo, however, rejected as false the idea that his wife had apologised to the pastor or admitted she was paid to make the accusation.\n\n\u201cI even saw one that they said my wife collected money and paid two other people to come and talk, and that she is saying sorry,\u201d he said of the rumours, describing them as \u201cdistractions\u201d.\n\nIn fact, the couple have filed a petition to the police over the case, although Dakolo said the force had not yet acted upon it.\n\nThe singer complained on social media of \u201cinstitutionalized intimidation\u201d following the appearance of armed police at the family home over the weekend. The police say they were merely delivering an invitation letter for the couple to speak to them.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear in what capacity the Dakolos were invited to speak to police, although this series of tweets confirmed that the case is the subject of an ongoing police investigation.\n\nAs for reports that Timi Dakolo had discussed his wife\u2019s virginity in a TV interview, the singer said he had never made any such comments, and he challenged journalists to unearth the footage if it really existed.\n\n\u201cLet us look at it, what will I and the reporter be talking about that we will be discussing me and my wife\u2019s sexuality? What will I be discussing in an interview that it will get to \u2018my wife is a virgin\u2019. It is not possible; there is no time, I can never.\u201d\n\nAnd as for the suggestion that the couple married in a COZA church, he said: \u201cI have never been to COZA in my life.\u201d\n\nThe couple have begun a campaign against sexual abuse in the church since Busola Dakolo went public with her allegations.\n\nAisha Buhari, wife of President Muhammadu Buhari, has also called on the inspector general of police to get justice for rape survivors in the country.", "lang": "en"}
