It is being claimed that the boy was beaten up for hoisting a saffron flag atop his house.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is from 2018, and the incident is not from West Bengal but Uttar Pradesh's Deoria. The actual incident happened over a money dispute.\n\nAmong many, the post is shared by Twitter user Chowkidar Jagdish Sethi who later deleted his tweet.\n\nThe video is doing the rounds on Facebook as well. The message with the video reads: \"This is the position of Hindus in West Bengal. This Hindu boy hoisted saffron flag atop his house. Forwarded by LT Col Dilip Kumar Havanur. The day is not too far every Hindu crucified like this boy. Share it maximum to reach every Hindu.\"\n\nWith the help of In-Vid tool, we found a news report of The Indian Express, according to which the incident took place in UP's Deoria in March 2018.\n\nAs per the report, the victim was identified as Shamshad who had lent Rs 1,500 to one Nasir. Both of them had quarrelled over money matter and Nasir with his friends assaulted Shamshad at an isolated place. Later, police arrested six accused in the case. News agency ANI also reported this issue.\n\nThe video with the same claim went viral last year too. At that time, Boomlive debunked this fake news.\n\nDisclaimer: The video shows violence which some people may find disturbing.", "lang": "en"}
