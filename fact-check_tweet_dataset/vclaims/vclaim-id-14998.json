Leftist Jignesh Mevani was slapped by a Begusarai nationalist.)\u201d The message is being circulated with a picture that shows Mevani in a scuffle with a crowd of people. The claim comes in the backdrop of the Gujarat MLA\u2019s recent visit to the constituency to campaign for the candidature of CPI\u2019s Kanhaiya Kumar.\n\nA similar message and the image have been shared by several Twitter users.\n\nFake news website Dainik Bharatpiblished an article on the alleged incident.\n\nThe photograph of Mevani in a tussle with a crowd of people is an old image that was shared by the MLA himself in 2018.\n\nThe same image was also published by Oneindia on February 18, 2018.\n\nLast year in February, Mevani was part of a Dalit protest triggered by the suicide of prominent Dalit activist Bhanubhai Vankar. The protest over land rights led to the detention of the independent legislator\u2019s by the state police. The viral image pertains to this incident.\n\nSocial media claims asserting that Jignesh Mevani was beaten during his visit to Begusarai are, thus, baseless. The lack of media reports on the alleged incident was suggestive of the same.", "lang": "en"}
