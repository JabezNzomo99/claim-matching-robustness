They emit frequencies that do everything from unlocking doors to logging onto computers, removing the need to turn a key or flip a switch.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true some people have voluntarily been implanted, there\u2019s not a shred of evidence to support the absurd notion that the procedure is mandatory in Australia, as this story claims.\n\nThe fake item appears to be a gross distortion of a puff piece from an actual Australian media outlet about an entrepreneur from Sydney who runs a business implanting microchips in customers\u2019 skin.\n\nBut there\u2019s no evidence that the tech entrepreneur or her chip-implanting business are acting on behalf of the government of Australia, or that customers sought her service because a government policy requires them to do so.\n\nThis bogus item follows a familiar fake news formula, wending its way from a shocking, clickbait-y headline, through muddled reasoning that attempts to support an ultimately untenable central premise.\n\nWe rate this statement Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
