The video is shared in the context of the ongoing clashes at the border between India and China along the LAC (Line of Actual Control). But FACTLY found the video to be of an old incident and not related to the ongoing border clashes. In March 2019, during an encounter between the Indian army and militants in Kupwara, four security force personnel (two CRPF personnel and two J&K Police personnel) had lost their lives. The video shows CRPF Troops bid an emotional farewell to the soldiers killed in that encounter in Kupwara (Jammu and Kashmir). So, the video is not related to the border dispute with China.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
