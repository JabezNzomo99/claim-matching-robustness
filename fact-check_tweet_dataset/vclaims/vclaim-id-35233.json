The latest addition to this list is an article(archive) by the website ab-tc.com. The report\u2019s headline reads, \u201cChina seek for court\u2019s approval to kill the over 20,000 coronavirus patients to avoid further spread of the virus.\u201d\n\nAlt News noticed this article is also being circulated on Twitter. We have also received several requests on WhatsApp (+91 76000 11160).\n\nNo reports by the mainstream media\n\nAlt News did a keyword search and found that no mainstream media has reported on the viral claim that \u201cChina seek for court\u2019s approval to kill the over 20,000 coronavirus patients to avoid further spread of the virus.\u201d However, Alt News found that multiple media outlets including TIME, BNO News, WIREDandRThave reported that over 20,000 confirmed cases have been reported world worldwide.\n\nAfter analysing the article and website, Alt News noticed that the home page of ab-tc.com showed several signs of being an inauthentic source of information.\n\nFor starters, the homepage, from February 7 edition of the website, had a story from August 17, 2019.\n\nThe most striking anomaly was that the viral article doesn\u2019t have a dateline but only the byline \u2018local correspondent\u2019. The screenshot below highlights four articles with the same byline. Moreover, the article doesn\u2019t cite any sources.\n\nAlt News did a keyword search on Google and found a statement by the Singapore government. According to the statement, \u201cOn 30 Jan 2020, a website called \u2018City News\u2019 published an article titled \u201cBREAKING NEWS: Singapore records six more coronavirus case, total of 16 now\u201d (https://ab-tc.com/singapore-coronavirus-cases/) claiming that five Singaporeans have contracted the Wuhan coronavirus without going to China.\u201d\n\nIn response, the Singapore government said, \u201cAs of 9pm on 30 Jan 2020, there is no local transmission of the Wuhan virus in Singapore. All confirmed cases in Singapore to date are Chinese nationals who travelled from Wuhan.\u201d\n\nPerforming another keyword search, Alt News found a report by Snopes, a US-based fact-checking website, on the viral article on February 6. Snopes stated that the \u201cwebsite (ab-tc.com) is full of junk news stories\u201d and cited multiped false reports published by the website in the past.\n\nThe report added, \u201cFor instance, a July 2010 article (still featured on the homepage) carries the headline, \u201cBREAKING: New York Giants coach Pat Shurmur has died.\u201d But Shurmur didn\u2019t die in 2010. In fact, he is still alive as of this writing and was hired as the offensive coordinator for the Denver Broncos in January 2020. The website has also published hoax articles about \u201ccannibal restaurants\u201d (debunked here), death hoaxes about celebrity couples (debunked here), doctored tweets from U.S. President Donald Trump, and a junk news article that falsely claimed Prince Andrew had committed suicide.\u201d\n\nAlt News also found that Lead Stories, another US-based fact-checking website, has published multiple reports on ab-tc.com. \n\n\n\nAlexa, a US-based web traffic analysis company, has ranked the website 504,468 in global internet engagement.\n\nAlt News also searchedab-tc.com on DomainBigData, domain name investigation tools. The website is registered to Alim Zaidi from Muscut. The email id associated with the domain is ali.syedzada@yahoo.com.\n\nAccording to the DomainBigData, this id is associated with two more domains \u2013 almuqeem.net (not functional any more) and globalpillars.com. Alt News noticed that globalpillars.com recognises itself as DomainNameSales. According to the website, it has been featured in Bloomberg Businessweek, The Boston Globe, MarketWatch, Reuters and Yahoo Finance.\n\nAlt News did keyword research and noticed that no reports were published by the following media outlets. This shows the owner of ab-tc.com domain has multiple websites which mislead people.\n\nTherefore, the viral article published by ab-tc.com is fabricated and the website should not be considered as a reliable source of information. The claim that China has not sought the court\u2019s approval to take the life of 20,000 coronavirus patients is false", "lang": "en"}
