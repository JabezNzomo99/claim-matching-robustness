The site dubiously passed it off as breaking news, bearing the headline, \u201cJUST IN! JOMA SISON HINILING KAY PANGULONG DUTERTE NA ISUKO ANG PWESTO KAY ROBREDO! (Just in! Joma Sison asks President Duterte to yield his position to Robredo).\u201d\n\nInquirer.net\u2019s original report was published after Sison, in a Nov. 11, 2019 post on his personal Facebook (FB) account, called on Duterte to yield his position to Vice President Leni Robredo following the Palace\u2019s announcement that the chief executive will take a three-day rest from his \u201cpunishing schedule.\u201d\n\nPhilTrends\u2019 misleading report surfaced six days after Duterte\u2019s April 27 Talk to the People address, where he said there will be \u201cno more peace talks\u201d with the CPP because the group and its militant arm, the New People\u2019s Army, have \u201cno respect either for their spoken words or in their deeds of killing soldiers.\u201d\n\nA look at PhilTrends\u2019 website also raises red flags on its legitimacy and credibility. It lacks an About page and Contact Us page, while its social media buttons only lead to the home page of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Google, and the story, when opened, is filled with advertisements.\n\nFB pages ATTY.
