Let\u2019s check the authenticity of that claim.\n\n\n\nThe post was originally shared in 2018 but it is being shared again and has attracted more than 29k shares till the time of writing this article.\n\nWhen the image in the post was subjected to Google reverse image search technique, an article of a news agency \u2018Independent\u2019 was obtained in the search results. In that article, published in November 2016, the same image was found in the gallery titled \u2018The Destruction of Nimrud\u2019. From the description of the photo, it was found that it shows an Iraqi man and woman crying in 2003 when they visited the Assyrian gallery during a brief reopening of the Baghdad Museum to display the ancient Nimrud treasure. The image had the photo credits to \u2018Reuters\u2019. So, when searched with relevant keywords in \u2018Reuters pictures\u2019, the same photo was found in its library. The information corroborated with the above finding that the image was taken at the Baghdad Museum. So, the photo wasn\u2019t clicked at the British Museum as said in the post.\n\n\n\nIn the comments section of the post, a user Amal Al-Jabouri has written that it\u2019s her picture and is being shared on social media with incorrect information. Amal Al-Jabouri has commented that the person seen along with her in the photo is Muwaffaq Tikriti and it was taken at Iraqi Museum in Baghdad and not at the British Museum. Amal (the website given in her comment describes her as a poet) has said that she and her colleagues started crying at the museum for the loss of Iraqi heritage and Iraqis.\n\nTo conclude, the image was taken at the Baghdad Museum in Iraq, not at the British Museum. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
