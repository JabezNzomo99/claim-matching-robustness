Obviously, we are not getting engaged in the Syrian civil war.\u201d\n\nU.S. military officials said the coalition was in contact with Russia before, during and after the February 7-8 attack and had alerted Russia to the presence of SDF (Syrian Democratic Forces) personnel in that area.\n\nMattis said the Russians had told the American military that they did not have any forces there.\n\n\u201cVia the administration of the president of Russia and the Defense Ministry, explanations were quickly given concerning the absence of Russian troops near the American air strike,\u201d Zakharova told reporters.\n\nZakharova\u2019s claims about the number of people killed in the incident and their citizenship contradict Western and the Russian media reports.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to imagine that it would take such a long time\u201d for the Russian Foreign Ministry to establish the citizenship of those wounded, Navalny said, especially given that \u201cthe injured had been transported back to Russia.\u201d\n\nRussia has its own military bases in various locations in Syria, and the Russian military and government are closely cooperating with Bashar Assad and his armed forces.\n\nVarious media have identified at least eight Russian citizens whose relatives and friends confirmed that they were killed in Syria's Deir el-Zour on the night of February 7- 8.\n\nHere is the list, compiled from several outlets, including Novayagazeta.ru, Fontanka.ru, Rferl.org and others:\n\nAlexey Shikhov, from the city of Nizhny Novgorod\n\nRuslan Gavrilov, from the village of Kedrovka, Sverdlov region\n\nStanislav Matveyev, from the town of Asbest, Sverdlov region\n\nIgor Kosoturov, from the town of Asbest, Sverdlov region\n\nAlexey Ladygin, from the city of Ryazan\n\nAnother prominent Russian opposition figure, Grigory Yavlinsky, who is running against Vladimir Putin in the March 2018 presidential elections, sent an open letter to the Kremlin and the military demanding the truth about what happened in Syria on the night of February 7-8.\n\n\u201cI demand an explanation of why Russian citizens are taking part in ground military operations in Syria, despite the statements made by the president and the defense minister about the withdrawal of Russian military forces from that country, and that the civil war in Syria was over,\u201d Yavlinsky wrote.\n\nThe Russian independent news outlet Znak.com reported that \u201c217 Russian mercenaries\u201d were killed in the incident, while Bloomberg.com, citing Russian military sources, said about 300 Russians were killed.\n\nOn February 11, Polygraph.info acquired three separate audio recordings from a source close to Kremlin, who claimed the people speaking on the recordings are personnel from \u201cCHVK Wagner,\u201d and the audio-clips are recorded phone conversations. CHVK is the Russian abbreviation for \u201cPrivate Military Company.\u201d\n\nThe man on the longest audio clip, speaking Russian with a Moscow accent, detailed what he said was \u201cour failed attack\u201d against a U.S.-held oil refinery in Deir el-Zour on the night of February 7-8.\n\n\u200bAlthough, private military groups are illegal in Russia, multiple intelligence reports and experts say CHVK Wagner is a Russian government shadow paramilitary group that is used in conflicts around the world, including Ukraine, Georgia and Syria.\n\nCHVK Wagner is known to hire paramilitary personnel from Russia and, more recently, from other places, such as eastern Ukraine. It is unclear how many of the scores said to have been killed in the incident were citizens of countries other than Russia.\n\nEvelyn Farkas, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia during the Obama administration, told Bloomberg.com: \"Any Russian mercenaries, whether they are in Ukraine or Syria, work for the Russian government.\"\n\nBelow is an English transcript of the audio recordings and the actual audio clips in Russian with English captions:\n\n\u201cThe reports that are on TV about \u2026 well, you know, about Syria and the 25 people that are wounded there from the Syrian f*** Army and -- well ... to make it short, we\u2019ve had our asses f*** kicked. So, one squadron f**** lost 200 people \u2026right away, another one lost 10 people\u2026 and I don\u2019t know about the third squadron but it got torn up pretty badly, too... So three squadrons took a beating\u2026 The Yankees attacked\u2026 first they blasted the f*** out of us by artillery and then they took four helicopters up and pushed us in a f*** merry-go-round with heavy caliber machine guns\u2026.They were all shelling the holy f*** out of it and our guys didn\u2019t have anything besides the assault rifles\u2026 nothing at all, not even mentioning shoulder-fired SAMs or anything like that\u2026So they tore us to pieces for sure, put us through hell, and the Yankees knew for sure that the Russians were coming, that it was us, f*** Russians\u2026 Our guys were going to commandeer an oil refinery and the Yankees were holding it\u2026 We got our f**** asses beat rough, my men called me... They\u2019re there drinking now\u2026 many have gone missing\u2026 it\u2019s a total f***-up, it sucks, another takedown\u2026.Everybody, you know, treats us like pieces of sh*** ... They beat our asses like we were little pieces of sh***... but our f*** government will go in reverse now and nobody will respond or anything and nobody will punish anyone for this... So these are our casualties\u2026\n\n\u201cOut of all vehicles only one tank survived and one BRDM (Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle) after the attack, all other BRDMs and tanks were destroyed in the first minutes of the fight, right away.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust had a call with a guy; so they basically formed a convoy, but did not get to their f*** positions by some three hundred meters. One unit moved forward, the convoy remained in place, about 300 meters from the others. The others raised the American f*** flag and their artillery started f*** ours really hard. Then their f*** choppers flew in and starter f*** everybody. Ours just running around. Just got a call from a pal, so there are about 215 f*** killed. They simply rolled ours out f*** hard. Made their point. What the f*** ours were hoping for in there?! That they will f*** run away themselves? Hoped to f*** scare them away? Lots of people f*** so bad [they] can\u2019t be f*** ID-d. There was no foot soldiers [on the American side]; they simply f*** our convoy with artillery.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
