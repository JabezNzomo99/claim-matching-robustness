No, that's not true: some joker posted a prank to a prank generator website with a misleading domain name that confuses readers into thinking it is CBS News (it is not). The story is not real, just like many other \"brand X is shutting down\" stories that often get posted to such sites.\n\nThe story originated from an article published to cbsnews.us (not cbsnews.com) on September 13, 2018 titled \"Raising Cane's to closing all restaurants by end of 2019 \" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail, spelling errors and all, yet many still though it was real.\n\nHowever the news section of the restaurant chain's own website makes no mention of this \"news\" and is currently even announcing the opening of a new location:\n\nThe prank site pushing the hoax is part of a network of prank websites centered around thefakenewsgenerator.com that allow anyone to create a realistic looking fake news article. The network offers a selection of misleading domain names that can be used to make it look like an article came from real news websites such as CBS News, Associated Press or The New York Times. Each hoax article comes with following disclaimer at the top of the page:\n\nWe wrote about cbsnews.us before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Chris Brown NOT Found Unconscious In His Los Angeles Home\n\u2022 Fake News: San Antonio NOT To Become First City In Texas To Legalize Marijuana\n\u2022 Fake News: Rapper \"Post Malone\" NOT Shot Outside of Californian Music Venue\n\u2022 Fake News: Rapper Kendrick Lamar NOT Shot Outside Los Angeles Studio & Is NOT In Critical Condition\n\u2022 Fake News: Cardi B NOT Dead, Nicki Minaj Did NOT Shoot Her Outside LA Cafe", "lang": "en"}
