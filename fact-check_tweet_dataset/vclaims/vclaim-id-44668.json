The viral posts claim that the video was shot in the Guwahati-Shillong Road recently.\n\n\n\nThe posts started being circulated amid reports of floods in Assam and similar incidents of Landslides in Meghalaya. According to an NDTV report, around three lakh people in 300 villages across Assam have been affected by flash floods. The death toll as of May 29 is three. Video of landslide is from a recent incident in north-east India. A reverse image search of the video was done by breaking the video into individual frames using InVid. This led to a video on Youtube from which the 30 second viral video clip has been taken. The video was uploaded on April 9, 2020. \"Landslide in Sukanagara-Cianjur South on April 9, 2020 (Translated To English),\" reads the caption of the video.\n\nA keyword search based on the caption led to a report by Indonesian media outlet Tribun Jateng. It was published on April 9 2020.\n\n The report titled, 'Video of Bukit Landslide Seconds in Cianjur, Sadly Residents Are Busy Recording Without Reminding Riders (Translated to English)' talks about a landslide in a suburb in the Indonesian province of West Java.\n\nFurther, Meghalaya Police took to Twitter to confirm that the video is not from a national highway in Meghalaya. \"A video clip of a Landslide which is being circulated on social media is from settlements of Chiangjur & Sukanagara in Indonesia, NOT from National Highway of Meghalaya. We request citizens not to share or circulate the video clip with false content or caption,\" reads the tweet.\n\nTherefore, the viral video clip is from a landslide in Indonesia which occurred earlier last month.\n\n If you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343 Also Read: Fact Check: Old Photos Of Forest Fire Shared As Recent Incident From Uttarakhand", "lang": "en"}
