You once told a contestant on The Celebrity Apprentice it would be a \u2018pretty picture\u2019 to see her on her knees. Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president? And how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton, who was likely to be the Democratic nominee, that you are part of the 'war on women'?\"\n\nTrump, who owned up only to insulting comedian Rosie O\u2019Donnell, Kelly after the debate \u2014 saying that she \"behaved very badly,\" that \"she had blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever,\" and sharing a Twitter post that referred to her as a \" only inflaming debate about whether he is a misogynistic .\n\nNBC host Chuck Todd tried to get Trump to understand why his comments are perceived as sexist, bringing up New York Times columnist Gail Collins and singer Bette Midler as two more examples of times he went after a woman\u2019s \"looks.\"\n\n\"Well, some of the things that she said, I didn't say, okay?\" Trump said of Kelly. \"And she went through a whole list. And this is a hell of a first question, by the way. But I will say this, I was attacked by the people that you talk about.\"\n\nWe decided to fact-check whether Kelly said things that Trump didn\u2019t say and look at the context of some of his other arguments with high-profile women.\n\nA spokesperson for Trump\u2019s campaign could not be reached for comment.\n\nKelly said Trump had referred to women as \"fat pigs\" and \"slobs.\"\n\nAs he admitted during the debate, Trump has leveled both invectives at O\u2019Donnell, the comedian and former panelist on The View.\n\nHe rattled off the first in a Dec. 29, 2006, interview with Fox News while imagining how O\u2019Donnell\u2019s ex-wife Kelli might have explained the couple\u2019s relationship to her parents.\n\n\"Can you imagine the parents of Kelli ... when she said, 'Mom, Dad, I just fell in love with a big, fat pig named Rosie?\u2019 \" he said.\n\nTrump also referred to O\u2019Donnell as an \" \" and a \" \" in 2006.\n\nSo the insults clearly happened, apparently spurred by comments O\u2019Donnell made on the Dec. 20, 2006, episode of The View. After Trump announced he would a Miss USA winner who had been accused of drug use, underage drinking and \"sexual indiscretions,\" O\u2019Donnell criticized Trump\u2019s personal and professional dealings, pointing out that a few of Trump\u2019s companies had gone bankrupt in the past and calling him a \"snake-oil salesman.\"\n\nO\u2019Donnell also lamented Trump\u2019s appearance as the \"moral authority\" in the scandal, pointing to his two divorces as evidence that he should not be considered \"a model for the nation\u2019s 20-year-olds.\"\n\nOne incident, as Todd brought up, refers to an insult he allegedly directed at Gail Collins, a liberal op-ed columnist for the New York Times who had interviewed Trump during his early years as a developer. In a 2011 Times , Collins wrote, \"He is extremely sensitive to any gibes about his business record, which has been up and down over the years. During one down period, I referred to him in print as a \u2018financially embattled thousandaire,\u2019 and he sent me a copy of the column with my picture circled and \u2018The Face of a Dog!\u2019 written over it.\"\n\nWe could not independently verify Collins\u2019 claim, or dig up her original story from a \"down period\" for Trump.\n\nBut Trump directed at Arianna Huffington on Twitter in April.\n\nKelly also referenced Trump\u2019s during a lawsuit involving one of his Florida developments.\n\nIn a 2011 lawsuit, Elizabeth Beck, a lawyer representing Trump\u2019s opponents, asked for a medical break, saying she had to pump breast milk for her 3-month-old daughter. But Trump objected, calling Beck \"disgusting\" when she took out the pump. Trump left the deposition, halting the day\u2019s proceedings.\n\nTrump once traded barbs with the singer and actress Bette Midler, as Todd pointed out on Meet the Press. In 2012, Midler tweeted about Trump: \"The man who has ruined New York seeks to ruin the nation.\" Midler deleted the tweet, but later referred to him as \"stupid\" and called his hairstyle a \" terrible dye job someone talked him into .\"\n\nTrump replied by calling Midler \" ,\" as well as \" ,\" \" ,\" and .\n\nWe could not find documentation of an exact time he said \"disgusting animal,\" but he has certainly used both words.\n\nAnother remark came in 2013 during an episode of Trump\u2019s reality show, The Celebrity Apprentice. During a judging session with Trump, former rocker Bret Michaels described a female contestant, Playboy playmate Brande Roderick, as \"falling to her knees\" and begging not to be fired.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" Trump said. \"You dropped to your knees?\"\n\n\"It must be a pretty picture, you dropping to your knees,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump said that \"he didn\u2019t say\" some of the things about women that Kelly talked about.\n\nThe record, however, shows the opposite is true. He has said exactly what Kelly mentioned in the debate.", "lang": "en"}
