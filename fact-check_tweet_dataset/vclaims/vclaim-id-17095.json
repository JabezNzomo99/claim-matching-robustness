But because of how the Monarchy is funded, that doesn\u2019t mean the renovation cost the taxpayer any extra money.\n\nThe Crown Estate (the Monarch\u2019s property portfolio) makes a profit each year, which adds to the total pot of money the government has to spend. The government gives some of that pot in a grant to the Queen each year, with the grant amount usually a fixed percentage of the profit the Estate has made. Part of that grant is what paid for these renovations.\n\nTaxpayers (and equivalently the government) are not directly worse off financially because these renovations are happening, and would be no better off this year if no renovations had been made.\n\nHow the renovations were paid for\n\nThe renovations were paid for out of something called the Sovereign Grant. As the name suggests, this is a grant paid to the Sovereign (the Queen) by the government.\n\nIt can only be spent on official expenditure such as staff costs, official travel and property maintenance. As Frogmore Cottage is an official royal residence, renovations were paid for out of the Sovereign Grant. In 2019/20 the Queen will receive \u00a382 million from the Grant.\n\nSo where does this money come from?\n\nIn her role as Head of State, the Queen owns a big property portfolio called the Crown Estate. This is public money, and all the profits from the Estate go to the Treasury. (The Queen also has other sources of income we\u2019ve discussed before).\n\nThe Treasury collects all that money together with the income it gets from general taxation and other sources, and puts it all into one pot: the \u201cConsolidated Fund\u201d. We\u2019ll refer to this pot as \u201cpublic money\u201d; most of it comes from general taxation, but some of it is from non-tax sources (such as the Crown Estate profits).\n\nThe Treasury then pays the Sovereign Grant to the Queen, which is currently calculated as the equivalent of 25% of the Crown Estate\u2019s profits two years previously. The amount of the grant isn\u2019t determined by how much the royal family plans to spend.\n\nIn any year, the Treasury always pays at least as much as it paid in Sovereign Grant the previous year, so if the Crown Estate\u2019s profits were to go down then the Grant would not (and so would end up being more than 25%). This hasn\u2019t happened yet; since the Sovereign Grant replaced the old system of funding the monarchy in 2011, the estate\u2019s profits have increased each year.\n\nSo to frame this as \u201ctaxpayers\u2019 money\u201d doesn\u2019t quite give the whole picture. It is certainly public money, but that\u2019s not quite the same thing as taxpayers\u2019 money. The Crown Estate makes more in profits for the Treasury than the Queen takes from the Treasury through the Grant. If the Grant were not paid at all then there would be more public money available, but under the current system this money would have been paid out anyway at the same level with or without the renovations to Frogmore Cottage.\n\nTo understand why the Queen gets a grant it\u2019s important to look at how the Sovereign\u2019s role has changed over time.\n\nHistorically, the Sovereign was responsible for lots of government expenses and used income from their lands to help pay for this.\n\nAs public taxes became more important than Crown lands income as the Government\u2019s primary source of revenue, King George III agreed to give the income from some Crown holdings to the Treasury in exchange for an annual payment.\n\nThese holdings are collectively known as the Crown Estate. The estate includes lots of properties which generate income from things like rent.\n\nOver time, more and more income from Crown lands was handed over to government, and as such the Sovereign was directly responsible for less and less government expense.", "lang": "en"}
