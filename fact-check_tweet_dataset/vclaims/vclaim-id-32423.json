Upping the nerd meter, she issued two lengthy letters from two groups of well-respected experts, which explained (with lots of footnotes) exactly how much her plan would cost \u2014 and how she would pay for it.\n\nWarren\u2019s biggest challenge was figuring out how to pay for Medicare-for-all, which generally has been estimated to mean $32 trillion to $34 trillion in additional federal spending over 10 years. Even Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the main sponsor in the Senate for such a system, has shied away from explaining how he would make up the difference during this campaign, instead issuing a list of illustrative examples.\n\n-$6.1 trillion: Grabbing current state and local funding on health care. Warren would redirect existing state and local government spending on health care to federal coffers for use in Medicare-for-all. States might object but the Warren team believes this passes constitutional muster because states would only be required to maintain what they have already been doing. In other words, new costs would not be imposed. (Here\u2019s a letter from a University of Michigan professor to Warren making that case.)\n\n-$2.9 trillion: Comprehensive payment overhaul. Warren would pay physicians at Medicare rates, while hospitals would be paid at 110 percent of Medicare rates, in effect reductions from what they receive from private insurance. She would also impose a series of other payment changes that the campaign says would mitigate the blow, but other analysts suggest would mean deeper cuts than just paying at Medicare rates. Such payment reductions would be controversial, especially because Congress has a long record of balking at imposing cuts in provider payments in the past.\n\n-$1.1 trillion: Slowing growth in medical costs. Warren argues that a new health-care system would mean that health-care costs would grow at the projected rate of U.S. gross domestic product, or about 3.9 percent. That would be in sharp contrast to the huge increases in the past, as health spending has grown from 6.9 percent of GDP in 1970 to 17.9 percent of GDP in 2017. The expert letter points to international examples to say this is possible, but other experts may not find it credible. Simon Johnson, an MIT professor who signed both expert letters, says such savings are only possible with a single-payer system.\n\n+$8.8 trillion: Employer Medicare contribution. Employers currently are projected to spend nearly $9 trillion paying for their employee health care between 2020 and 2029. Instead of employers continuing to give that money to insurance companies, Warren proposes that businesses direct 98 percent to the federal government and keep 2 percent for themselves, for a minor tax cut. Basic economic theory holds that such payments are essentially a tax on employees because it comes out of compensation. (\u201cWarren\u2019s indirect levy is effectively a flat tax on all workers at the same firm,\u201d wrote Howard Gleckman of the Tax Policy Center. \u201cBy contrast, a straightforward income tax or well-designed payroll tax would be much more progressive.\u201d) But Warren argues it\u2019s an existing tax, not a new tax.\n\n+3.0 trillion: Taxes on the top 1 percent. Warren would make the very wealthy finance health insurance for the rest of the country. She had previously proposed a 1 percent surtax on net worth above $1 billion to fund other proposals, but she generates $1 trillion by adding an additional three percentage points to the billionaire surtax. Then she collects $2 trillion by eliminating preferential tax rates on capital gains and dividends \u2014 which affects anyone owning stocks or bonds \u2014 and making the top 1 percent pay tax on capital gains on an annual basis, not simply when an asset is sold. This kind of proposal excites tax wonks, but Wall Street would scream. (The Warren campaign notes that compared with other industrialized countries the United States is an outlier in terms of tax revenue as a percentage of GDP.)\n\n+$2.3 trillion: Improvements in tax enforcement. This is a large number for an iffy prospect. Lawmakers have talked endlessly about improving tax enforcement, and this number is larger than many estimates of the potential gain. Warren cites a 15 percent \u201ctax gap\u201d \u2014 the gap between what is owed and what is collected \u2014 and says it could be reduced to 10 percent. The experts\u2019 letter notes the United Kingdom has a gap of only 5.6 percent, but this revenue number could be challenged as unrealistic.\n\n+$1.4 trillion: Revenue from additional take-home pay. While employers would still keep paying for health insurance, workers would no longer have to contribute to premiums. Since that\u2019s now collected pretax, workers would have additional income subject to taxation, amounting to $1.15 trillion in new revenue. The Warren plan would also eliminate the need for health savings accounts, medical savings accounts and deductions for medical expenses, yielding another $250 billion in previously lost revenue. (Johnson says there was some debate as to whether the $1.4 trillion should have been included as a cost reduction, but ultimately the experts determined it was best listed as a revenue raiser. It could go in either category.)\n\nBut the whole thing starts to fall apart if these numbers do not survive extensive scrutiny. If one believes the provider cuts are too steep or the administrative savings are unrealistic, then the cost side of the equation is higher than estimated. And if the revenue raisers are suspect, such as the money obtained from better tax enforcement, then the expected revenue falls short.", "lang": "en"}
