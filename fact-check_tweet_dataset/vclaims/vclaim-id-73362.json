The claim is false; the video shows a tsunami that hit Japan\u2019s Miyagi prefecture in 2011.\n\nThe three-minute 47-second clip was published here on Facebook on August 26, 2020. It has been viewed more than 15,000 times.\n\nThe video was also shared alongside a similar claim on Facebook here and here.\n\nHowever, the claim is false.\n\nReverse image and keyword searches on Google found that the footage in fact shows a tsunami that hit Japan\u2019s Miyagi prefecture in 2011. A longer version of the video was published here on YouTube on December 18, 2011.\n\nThe Japanese caption translates to English as: \u201cIshinomaki city Tsunami TSUNAMI JAPAN 3.11/2011\u201d.\n\nThe video\u2019s English caption reads: \u201c\u2018Ishinomaki-shi Tidal wave\u2019 eastern Japan great earthquake A picture in Ishinomaki-shi, Miyagi. I suggest you be rubbed by such tidal wave, it can't be done. I take a picture from a roof of Ishinomaki gas. 2-3-48, Myojincho, Ishinomaki-shi, Miyagi\u201d.\n\nThe tsunami swept through much of Japan\u2019s northeastern shoreline after a powerful earthquake struck the seabed off Miyagi on March 11, 2011. The disaster killed almost 16,000 people with more than 2,500 still missing, AFP reported here.\n\nBelow is a side-by-side screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading post (L) and the YouTube video (R):\n\nAFP also covered the 2011 devastation in Ishinomaki in a video report here.\n\nOther false claims about the video shared in the misleading posts have previously been debunked by AFP. Those claims wrongly stated that the footage showed the collapse of a hydropower dam in Laos in 2020; flooding during Typhoon Hagibis in 2019; and a tsunami in Indonesia in 2018.", "lang": "en"}
