In this case, we are going to look at the overall economic picture depicted by Trump \u2014 a world in which the United States never wins at trade and is flooded by imports because China and Japan keep their currencies artificially low, a world in which high tariffs would bring manufacturing back to Michigan and other states.\n\nTrump frequently suggests the United States is \u201closing money\u201d when there is a trade deficit, but that reflects a fundamental misunderstanding. Americans want to buy these products from overseas, either because of quality or price. If Trump sparked a trade war and tariffs were increased on Chinese goods, then it would raise the cost of those products to Americans. Perhaps that would reduce the purchases of those goods, and thus reduce the trade deficit, but that would not mean the United States would \u201cgain\u201d money that had been lost.\n\nWe urge all readers to view such claims with deep skepticism. (Here\u2019s our take on one such study concerning the Korea Free Trade Agreement.) The job-loss figures often rely on simplistic formulas that are disputed by other economists. It is often difficult to separate out the impact of trade agreements on jobs, compared to other, broader economic trends. (Readers should also be wary of claims of job gains from trade deals, as we noted in this column on the Trans Pacific Partnership.)\n\nAs a result of NAFTA, the United States, Canada and Mexico constitute an economically integrated market, especially for the auto industry. Auto parts and vehicles produced in each country freely flow over the borders, without tariffs or other restrictions, as thousands of part suppliers serve the automakers that build the vehicles. This is known as the \u201cmotor vehicle supply chain.\u201d In fact, the prospective Ford plant that Trump complains about appears to be intended to produce cars for export from Mexico \u2014 and thus would free up production to produce more trucks in the United States.\n\nMexico has signed nearly 50 free-trade agreements, and so much of the new auto production there is coming from Asia and Europe, not the United States, said Guido Vildozo, Latin America sales forecaster for IHS Automotive. \u201cWhen Asian and European OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] were looking at growing in the Americas to hedge against their own currencies, they decided Mexico was the way to go given the free-trade agreements the country has and the know-how they have on building smaller vehicles \u2014 whereas the U.S. has always focused more on higher added value vehicles and trucks,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Japanese (and European) auto manufacturers also have opened factories across the United States, hiring Americans. Most have settled in the South, in right-to-work states, and that in turn has led to supplier parks beings established nearby. Trump\u2019s promise that he was going to bring car companies back to Michigan ignores the fact that Michigan has been losing the auto industry to other states, not countries, because of its union traditions. \u201cMichigan would have to pull up its socks in a big way,\u201d said Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cYou might be able to bring some auto production back to the United States but not necessarily to Michigan.\u201d\n\nAuto production by Japanese brands in the United States topped a record 3.8 million in 2014, according to Japan Automobile Manufacturers Assn. Japanese automakers also made more than 4.3 million engines and purchased a high of $66 billion in U.S. automotive parts. Honda, in fact, for the first time exported more U.S.-made models than it imported from Japan. However, about one-fourth of all auto parts used in the United States \u2014 especially electronics, which are lighter and more easily shipped\u2014continue to be imported from Asia or Europe, according to CRS.\n\nDean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, notes that Japanese manufacturers first located in the United States to get around the \u201cvoluntary\u201d export restraints put in place under President Ronald Reagan. He said that because the U.S. car market is so large, \u201cif you imposed barriers that made it more expensive for them to import parts rather than produce them here, they will produce more of their car parts in the United States.\u201d But he says this was would not necessarily be a good thing to do \u2014 and the 35 percent tariffs suggested by Trump would violate trade agreements, leading to penalties and retaliation.\n\n\u201cIn real terms, U.S. factories produced more output (looking at straight output or value added) last year than ever before in history,\u201d said Dan Ikenson, director of trade policy studies at the Cato Institute. \u201cYear after year (with the exception of during recessions), the sector breaks new records with respect to output, revenues, exports, imports, return on investment.\u201d Yet at the same time, the number of manufacturing workers (12.3 million) is about the same level as in 1945, when the U.S. population was nearly 60 percent smaller.\n\nChina has not manipulated its currency for at least two years and in recent months has been selling dollars and running down its reserves in an effort to keep the currency from weakening during an economic slowdown. Japan has not sought to lower its currency for at least a decade, with the exception of an intervention in March 2011 \u2014 a move that was supported by other leading economic powers because the yen had appreciated sharply in the wake of the devastating tsunami and earthquake.", "lang": "en"}
