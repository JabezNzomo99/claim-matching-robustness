Wages have risen each year but prices have risen faster.\n\nWhen prices rise it\u2019s called inflation. If you adjust wages for price inflation then you can see their \u2018real\u2019 value.\n\nThe real value of the median weekly wage for full time employees fell every year between 2008 and 2014.\n\nIt has grown again since 2014, although more recent published data suggests that the pace might have slowed over the past year.\n\nThere are lots of different ways you could slice and dice the jobs market to see how earnings have changed. We\u2019ve quoted median gross weekly earnings for full-time employees since that\u2019s the preferred headline measure used by Office for National Statistics.\n\nThe median wage is the wage of the middle-earning person. Among other things, focusing on median rather than mean average wage means that the picture isn\u2019t disproportionately affected by top earners.\n\nMore recent data is available for mean average wages. Broadly, the picture is much the same.\n\nBut it\u2019s still the national average across the UK as a whole. It might not match the view from specific regions, industries or age groups (for example) as the chief economist at the Bank of England discussed last June.\n\nIn theory, average wages could fall without any one person getting a pay cut, because new entrants might be getting less than before while older higher earners continue to retire. So these figures don't necessarily show what's happened to most people individually, but they do give a sense of what's happened overall.", "lang": "en"}
