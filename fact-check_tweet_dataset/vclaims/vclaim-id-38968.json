This is misleading; Biden used the word \u201cembarrassing\u201d while criticizing President Donald Trump \u2019s immigration policy, not the country as a whole.\n\n\u201cJOE BIDEN CALLS AMERICA AN EMBARRASSMENT,\u201d says text that appears under the video in Facebook posts here, here and here.\n\n\u201cThe only time Biden can say a coherent sentence is when he \u2019s ripping America!\u201d the posts say.\n\nBut it is clear from the video that Biden was not taking aim at America in general.\n\n\"The America I see values basic human decency, not snatching children from their parents, or turning our back on refugees at our border. Americans know that's not right. The American people understand please, because it makes us embarrassing,\u201d Biden says.\n\n\u201cThe American people know overwhelmingly that that's not right, that's not who we are,\u201d he says.\n\nHe was referring to the Trump administration\u2019s stance on immigration, which included a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy launched in 2018 that saw thousands of children separated from their parents at the border before the government backed down amid a torrent of criticism.\n\nThe clip in the Facebook posts shows Biden speaking at the Munich Security Conference in February 2019.\n\nOther posts making the same misleading claim feature a tweet originally sent just days after Biden\u2019s Munich remarks.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden just went to Europe telling people that America is \u201can embarrassment.\u201d No Joe Biden, YOU are the embarrassment. Who else Agrees?\u201d says the tweet, which has been shared as a screenshot on Facebook here and here.\n\n\n\n Biden has moved into the lead in the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination after racking up a series of primary victories in Super Tuesday voting on March 3, 2020.", "lang": "en"}
