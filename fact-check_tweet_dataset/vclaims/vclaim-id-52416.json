It is being claimed that the video shows the aftermath of the recent face-off with China in Ladakh.\n\nReplying to journalist Rana Ayyub, one Mandeep Singh Brar posted the video and wrote, \u201cOur blood is boiling for what Chinese did to our soldiers in Galwan valley.\u201d\n\nAnother Twitter user shared the video with the same claim.\n\nAlt News performed a keyword search on YouTube and found that last year a channel named HIILU ALL IN ONE published a longer three-minute version of the video currently being shared as the plight of Indian soldiers in Ladakh. As per the video description, a civil bus carrying 93 Border Security Force (BSF) troops met with a road accident while on the way to Silchar on October 30, 2019.\n\nUsing this as a clue, we performed a keyword search on Google restricting the results between October 30, 2019 to October 31, 2019 and found that Northeast Now published a news report that matches the above-mentioned context. As per the report, one person died and 22 others, including 20 BSF jawans and two civilians, were injured as a bus fell down in a gorge at Umtyrra in East Jaintia Hills on October 30, 2019.\n\nThe report added that the BSF team was heading back to their base in two civil buses, three heavy vehicles and one Bolero. One of the buses met with a mishap as it skidded off the National Highway 6 at Umtyrra.\n\nThe video was shared with false narratives last year as well. For instance, BSF officers killed in an accident or Indian soldiers killed in Pakistan. These were debunked by Factly and Times Fact Check.\n\nIn November 2019, Factly wrote an email to BSF Meghalaya for clarification. Randhir Ranjan (2IC \u2013 Operations, Ftr HQ BSF Meghalaya) responded, \u201cThere was no casualty of any BSF jawan in the bus accident. However, 01 helper of the civil bus, which was carrying the BSF jawan, died in that accident. All jawans who sustained injuries during the accident are safe and undergoing treatment at various hospitals.\u201d\n\nThe video therefore shows BSF jawans who were injured in a road accident in Meghalaya last year. The claim that they died in the recent India-China skirmish is false. The dispute has given rise to a lot of misinformation on social media with old images and videos being liked to the border tensions.", "lang": "en"}
