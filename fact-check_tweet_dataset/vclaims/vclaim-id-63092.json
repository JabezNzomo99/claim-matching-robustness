The claim originated on a parody news website.\n\nThe post features a screen grab of a tweet that links to an article published by the website News.enewsun.com. That article, which puts up the headline \u201cPope Francis: \u2018God will abandon America if Trump is re-elected,'\u201d claims the pope urged Americans not to vote for Trump in the 2020 presidential election during Mass.\n\n\u201cI am fearful that the least among them will fall victim again to the evil and morally decrepit creature Trump,\u201d the article quotes the pope as saying. \u201cI believe that should he be re-elected, God will abandon all of his blessings upon American, and may see fit to raze it down, as Sodom, as Gomorrah.\u201d\n\nHad the pope made such a statement, it would have been picked up by major media outlets, yet none have reported on it. (RELATED: Image Claims Pope Francis Made A Satanic Hand Gesture)\n\nThe article lifts nearly word-for-word from a story published on Bustatroll.org, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes \u201cparody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d Bustatroll.org also states that \u201ceverything on this website is fiction.\u201d\n\nThe claim made by both the Facebook post and the News.enewsun.com article originated on Bustatroll.org and should not be taken as fact.", "lang": "en"}
