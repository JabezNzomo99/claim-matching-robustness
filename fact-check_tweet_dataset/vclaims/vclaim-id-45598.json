The confusion arose after the company temporarily suspended some marketing efforts \u2014 not sales \u2014 amid the U.S. protests following the death of George Floyd.\n\nThe LEGO Group moved this week to temporarily stop marketing more than 30 products relating to law enforcement, but it hasn\u2019t stopped selling the products altogether, as some social media users have wrongly claimed.\n\nOn June 2, a trade publication called the Toy Book obtained and published an email in which a third-party asked affiliate partners on LEGO\u2019s behalf to remove more than 30 products from websites \u201cand any marketing ASAP.\u201d The email cited \u201crecent events.\u201d On its website, LEGO describes its affiliates as \u201chelping to drive traffic and sales through your website to LEGO.com.\u201d\n\nThe move arrived amid the protests across the U.S. against police brutality and racial injustice that have followed the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. Among the products cited in the email were the LEGO City Police Station, LEGO City Fire Station and other similar products \u2014 including an adult White House set.\n\nBut the news sparked confusion that the company would be, as one post said, \u201cpulling their Lego City Police playsets from stores indefinitely.\u201d Another tweet, which earned more than 1 million likes, said, \u201cTHEY PULLED ALL LEGO POLICE SETS FROM THE SHELVES.\u201d\n\nThe erroneous claim further drew attention on Twitter when President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, wrote on June 4: \u201cThis is nuts. @LEGO_Group is removing playsets featuring police, firefighters & emergency vehicles. Even ditching an adult White House kit. We ought to stress the good in law enforcement for kids. What does @JoeBiden think about LEGO erasing cops?\u201d\n\nResponding to Parscale, the company said: \u201cWe are not removing any LEGO sets from sale. Reports otherwise are false.\u201d\n\nThe company also addressed the claims in another June 4 tweet, saying that the \u201cintention was to temporarily pause digital advertising in response to events in the US\u201d \u2014 not end sales.\n\nLEGO\u2019s website shows the products in question still available.\n\nMichael McNally, senior director of brand relations for the LEGO Group, told us in an email: \u201cGenerations of children have loved playing with \u2026 our LEGO Police and Firefighter sets which can often be found in our LEGO CITY line and is a constant in our collection. These were available last week, are available now, and will always be available to our fans.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven the tragic events in the US over the past 10 days, we did pause all digital marketing, including content that could be perceived insensitive if promoted at this time,\u201d McNally said. \u201cWe intend to resume digital marketing next Monday.\u201d\n\nMcNally, saying the company stands \u201cwith the black community against racism and inequality,\u201d said LEGO intends to donate \u201c$4 million to organizations in the United States dedicated to non-profits that support black children and others that educate all children and families about tolerance and racial equality.\u201d He said details about that donation are not yet finalized.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media. Our previous stories can be found here.\n\nLEGO (@LEGO_Group). \u201cWe\u2019ve seen incorrect reports saying we\u2019ve removed some LEGO sets from sale. To be clear, that is not the case and reports otherwise are false. Our intention was to temporarily pause digital advertising in response to events in the US. We hope this clears things up.\u201d Twitter. 4 Jun 2020.\n\nMcNally, Michael. Senior director of brand relations, the LEGO Group. Email to FactCheck.org. 5 Jun 2020.", "lang": "en"}
