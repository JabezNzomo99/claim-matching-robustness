But it\u2019s current law right now that that person cannot walk in and do that. The FBI is notified as soon as they are, and there\u2019s this long wait protection put into process before they could actually purchase that weapon.\u201d Is he correct?\n\nFollowing the Orlando mass shooting during which the gunman claimed allegiance to the Islamic State, the Senate revived the debate over whether a suspected terrorist should be able to buy a gun. On Monday evening, the Senate voted on four gun control proposals that were doomed to fail before voting even began. Versions of the bills proposed in the Senate already failed in December 2015, following the shooting by Islamic State sympathizers in San Bernardino, Calif.\n\nLankford\u2019s staff said he was referring to existing FBI involvement in gun purchases, through which the FBI is flagged if someone on the Terrorist Watchlist is notified. Indeed, the FBI is notified if a person on a watch list tries to buy a gun, if the person\u2019s name is listed on a list called the Known or Appropriately Suspected Terrorist file (a subset of the larger consolidated list, according to the FBI).\n\nWith instant background checks, a person with a clean record in theory could walk into a gun store and be approved within minutes. However, if the person is on the suspected terrorist file, the FBI can delay the purchase for up to three days. According to a May 2013 Congressional Research Service report, the FBI has 72 hours to respond to the federally licensed dealer as to whether they can proceed with the sale.\n\nAfter a hold is placed on the sale, there has to be another qualifier under the law for the FBI to be able to ban the sale, Comey said. If the purchase is made at a gun show or through an Internet sale, the FBI is not alerted, Comey said. See this exchange:\n\nSen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.): If someone on the no-fly list walks into is a licensed firearms dealer in the United States, that in and of itself is not a prohibition against that person buying a firearm? Durbin: So even if that person is suspected to be a terrorist, they could purchase the firearm and leave with it, though your agents may then follow them or investigate them or keep an eye on them because of that purchase. Comey: That is correct. We have three days to review the background. And so a hit \u2014 if someone walks in and they\u2019re on the no-fly list, we\u2019ll immediately be notified. We\u2019ll have three days to figure out whether there is some prohibition under the law that allows us to stop the transaction. If not, they will walk out with the gun if the dealer transfers it. Durbin: Absent some other disqualifier, the fact that they\u2019re on the no-fly list is not enough \u2014 sufficient basis to deny the sale, is that correct?\n\nThus people on the Terrorist Watchlist still successfully purchase firearms. A March 2016 Government Accountability Office analysis looked at 2,477 times that people on the Terrorist Watchlist who were involved in firearm or explosives background checks in 2004 to 2015. Of the 2,477 times, 91 percent (2,265) of the transactions were allowed to proceed, and 212 were denied. Some sales may have been processed and approved within 24 hours; the FBI purges records if the sale was approved within 24 hours. So when Lankford says the person \u201cwaits a long time,\u201d he\u2019s referring to a hold of up to 72 hours\u2013but it could be less than 24 hours.\n\n\u201cIt is a fact that if someone is a known or suspected terrorist, they cannot walk into a store, buy a firearm and immediately walk out with that gun. It may take several days for the process to play out, because the FBI has the flexibility to run additional checks that might turn up a reason to deny the purchase,\u201d Lankford spokesman DJ Jordan said. \u201cBut they cannot walk in and walk out with a purchase immediately that day. This is the point Senator Lankford was making.\u201d\n\nLankford is correct that the FBI can get involved if someone on the Terrorist Watchlist tries to buy a gun, and that there is a waiting period during which the FBI can investigate and prevent the sale. But Lankford exaggerates the FBI\u2019s authority to take action after the agency is notified, and the time it takes for the FBI to approve the sale.\n\nUnder current law, membership in a terrorist organization or being on one of the watch lists does not stop someone from buying a gun. There has to be another factor that disqualifies the person from buying a gun under federal or state law, such as a felony conviction or illegal immigration status. The FBI can delay the sale up to three days \u2014 not necessarily a \u201clong\u201d time, especially when some sales may be approved within 24 hours. But without a second qualifier, the FBI can\u2019t ban the sale or transfer of the firearm.", "lang": "en"}
