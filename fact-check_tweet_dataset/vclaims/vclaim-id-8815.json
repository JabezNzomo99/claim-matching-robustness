He pleaded guilty to a lesser offense. She laughed when recalling unusual aspects of the case.\n\n\n\nDid Hillary Clinton volunteer to defend a child rapist in 1975, accuse the 12-year-old victim of fantasizing about older men, later state that she knew he was guilty but got the charges dropped and laugh?\n\nIn 1975, Hillary Clinton \u2014 then known as Hillary Rodham \u2014 taught at the University of Arkansas School of Law, where she founded the University of Arkansas School Legal Aid Clinic. It was during this time that she defended Thomas Alfred Taylor, a 41-year-old man accused of raping a 12-year-old girl.\n\nIn her book \u201cLiving History,\u201d Clinton recalls that Mahlon Gibson, a Washington County prosecutor, told her that the accused rapist \u201cwanted a woman lawyer\u201d to defend him, and that Gibson had recommended Clinton to Judge Maupin Cummings. \u201cI told Mahlon I really didn\u2019t feel comfortable taking on such a client, but Mahlon gently reminded me that I couldn\u2019t very well refuse the judge\u2019s request.\u201d\n\nCNN, June 25, 2014: Gibson said Clinton called him shortly after the judge assigned her to the case and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to represent this guy. I just can\u2019t stand this. I don\u2019t want to get involved. Can you get me off?\u201d \u201cI told her, \u2018Well contact the judge and see what he says about it,\u2019 but I also said don\u2019t jump on him and make him mad,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cShe contacted the judge and the judge didn\u2019t remove her and she stayed on the case.\u201d\n\nIn a separate 2014 interview, Clinton said she had an \u201cobligation\u201d to represent Taylor. \u201cI had a professional duty to represent my client to the best of my ability, which I did,\u201d she said.\n\nIn her book, Clinton writes that she visited Taylor in the county jail and he \u201cdenied the charges against him and insisted that the girl, a distant relative, had made up her story.\u201d Clinton filed a motion to order the 12-year-old girl to get a psychiatric examination. \u201cI have been informed that the complainant is emotionally unstable with a tendency to seek out older men and engage in fantasizing \u2026 [and] that she has in the past made false accusations about persons, claiming they had attacked her body,\u201d according to an affidavit filed by Clinton in support of her motion.\n\nClinton also cited an expert in child psychology who said that \u201cchildren in early adolescence tend to exaggerate or romanticize sexual experiences and that adolescents with disorganized families, such as the complainant\u2019s, are even more prone to such behavior,\u201d Clinton wrote in her affidavit.\n\nUpdate, Oct. 19: Clinton\u2019s motion was denied, according to court documents obtained in September by a Pennsylvania lawyer who took an interest in the case.\n\nUltimately, expert testimony from a scientist \u201ccast doubt on the evidentiary value of the blood and semen the prosecutor claimed proved the defendant\u2019s guilt in the rape,\u201d Clinton writes in her book. Clinton negotiated a plea deal and Taylor was charged with \u201cUnlawful Fondling of a Child Under the Age of Fourteen\u201d and was sentenced to one year in a county jail and four years of probation, according to a final judgment signed by Cummings.\n\nIn 2014, the Washington Free Beacon published the audio of an interview that Arkansas reporter Roy Reed conducted with Clinton in the 1980s. In the interview, Clinton recalls some unusual details of the rape case, and she can be heard laughing in three instances, beginning with a joke she makes about the accuracy of polygraphs.\n\nAt another point, Clinton said the prosecutor balked at turning over evidence, forcing her to go to the judge to obtain it.\n\nClinton then said that the evidence she obtained was a pair of the accused\u2019s underwear with a hole in it. Clinton told Reed that investigators had cut out a piece of the underwear and sent the sample to a crime lab to be tested, and the only evidence that remained was the underwear with a hole in it.\n\nClinton took the remaining evidence to a forensic expert in Brooklyn, New York, and the expert told her that the material on the underwear wasn\u2019t enough to test. \u201cHe said, you know, \u2018You can\u2019t prove anything,'\u201d Clinton recalled the expert telling her.\n\nThe emails we have received about this case contain some misinformation. Some have claimed, for example, that Clinton volunteered for the case and the accused rapist was found not guilty. That\u2019s not accurate, as we just explained. But Clinton did laugh in the retelling of some unusual aspects of the rape case, and we leave it to others to decide whether her laughter was appropriate or not.\n\nSchool of Law Legal Clinics.
