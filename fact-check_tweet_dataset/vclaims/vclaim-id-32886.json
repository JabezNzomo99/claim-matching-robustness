It was shot on December 19, 2019. \u201cPolice throw stones at protesters during demonstrations against India\u2019s new citizenship law in Lucknow on December 19,\u201d reads the caption attached with the image published in an article by Scroll. It has been credited to international news agency AFP.\n\nThe photograph was also carried by British media outlet Sky News on December 19, 2019, along with a report on protests against the Citizenship Act across the country.\n\nA two-month-old photograph showing a UP policeman throwing stones during-CAA protests was falsely shared with the claim that it depicts a Delhi cop stone-pelting in the ongoing riots.", "lang": "en"}
