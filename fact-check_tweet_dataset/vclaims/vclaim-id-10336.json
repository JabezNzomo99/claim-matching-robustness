No, that's just a fake story from a satire website that uses this false narrative to comment on current events.\n\nIt was published by the Rochdale Herald on April 13, 2018 under the headline \"Council demolish victim's home to erect memorial garden for dead burglar - The Rochdale Herald\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nIn a surprise move today London councillors have confirmed plans to demolish the home of 78 year old Mr Osborn-Brooks and in its place start construction of a memorial garden to the dead burglar, Henry Vincent. The initial plans feature a statue of Mr Vincent complete with 'swag bag' over his shoulder, a screwdriver clasped in his right hand along with a small water feature, fairy lights and a bench. Whilst local residents are up in arms over the plans, friends of the career burglar say it's what he would have wanted and will be a fitting way to remember a man who died doing what he loved, stealing from vulnerable pensioners.\n\nThe story vaguely resembled a real news article when viewed on social media:\n\nOnly yesterday the Rochdale Herald pubished a different story satirizing the same events:\n\nThe Rochdale Herald is a satirical website with following disclaimer on its about page:\n\nDaily news, satire and comment from the world's worst local newspaper. The Rochdale Herald is a satirical, spoof, parody commentary on current affairs, and stuff that annoys and amuses us. We make it up and it's not intended, in any way whatsoever, to be considered factual. If you read a story on The Rochdale Herald, please take a deep breath before going off the deep end as we probably made it up, apart from the horoscopes, they're all completely legit (no they aren't, we make those up too). We don't spend much time checking facts or corroborating sources because, and we can't stress this enough, we're not actually journalists and are making most of it up. This is an entertainment site that may occasionally confuse some fact with fiction and vice-versa but ultimately we're writing about the news to make you laugh. We also might talk about sex and swear a bit from time to time so if you're under 18 please don't read it. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental, seriously. If we've written about something that's offended you, please accept our apologies. Unless you are just being a big sissy and have forgotten how the internet works.\n\nWe wrote about rochdaleherald.co.uk before, here's another article that mention the site: Fake News: Season 9 of The Walking Dead NOT To Be Filmed in Burnley Asda", "lang": "en"}
