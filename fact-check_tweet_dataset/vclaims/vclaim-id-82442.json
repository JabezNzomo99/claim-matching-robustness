Pelosi does not sit on the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nPelosi is a popular target for misinformation on social media. This particular post claims that Pelosi, purportedly sitting on the House Appropriations Committee, passed a bill awarding her husband\u2019s San Francisco-based investment firm a contract to sell $9 billion worth of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) properties.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi\u2019s husband Paul owns Financial Leasing Services LLC a San Francisco-based Real estate and venture capitalist firm,\u201d the post reads. \u201cHis net worth is $120 million. Why is this important? His wife \u2018Nancy\u2019 sits on the \u2018House Appropriations\u2019 committee. This committee appropriates funds to the the United States Postal Service (and others). Why is this important? Easy. She passed a bill to sell off 9 billion dollars ( yes billion) worth of Federally owned post office property and awarded the contract to none other than Financial Leasing Services LLC. Her husband\u2019s firm.\u201d\n\nWhile it is true that Pelosi\u2019s husband, Paul, owns and operates Financial Leasing Services LLC, there is no evidence that Pelosi passed such a bill. Searching the congressional record and the Library of Congress database of legislation turned up instances mentioning his firm. (RELATED: Did Nancy Pelosi Say She Would Resign If Donald Trump Gets Re-elected?)\n\nThe House Appropriations Committee does not list Pelosi among its members on the committee\u2019s website, further adding to the post\u2019s dubiousness. As House speaker, she does not sit on any committees. Pelosi hasn\u2019t served on the House Appropriations Committee since the early 2000s, according to a document from the U.S. Government Printing Office.\n\nThe post may stem from an older claim about Democratic California Sen. Dianne Feinstein\u2019s husband, Richard Blum, receiving a contract in 2011 to market USPS facilities. Snopes reported in 2013 that \u201cno evidence supports the claim that Richard Blum\u2019s company obtained the contract due to his wife\u2019s influence.\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.", "lang": "en"}
