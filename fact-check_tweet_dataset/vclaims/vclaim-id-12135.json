No, that's not true: the story of his death was made up by a website with a history of publishing death hoaxes.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by chanteur-news-fr.info on January 27, 2019 titled \"\u00ab Jean-Claude Van Damme est mort \u00bb : l'acteur victime d'une crise cardiaque ...\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nJean-Claude Van Damme died today in hospital because of a heart attack. I called the ambulance at 7:15. The ambulance took the actor to hospital but it was too late. He died of a heart attack at 8:20.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nMost real news stories list an author and this one was published anonymously. This is important since the author claims to be the one who called the ambulance making it much harder to verify.\n\nBut no reliable news outlets made any mention of the story and Van Damme's official website and Twitter account make no mention of his death.\n\nWe wrote about chanteur-news-fr.info before: the site has a habbit of publishing death hoaxes:\n\u2022 Fake News: Singer Ma\u00eetre Gims NOT Dead After Road Accident In Paris\n\nAccording to WHOIS information the site appears to be Russian in origin so it is probably not the best source of information about Franco-Belgo-American pop culture:", "lang": "en"}
