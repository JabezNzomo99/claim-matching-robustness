Google Reverse Image search for the video was done by breaking the video into individual frames using InVid.\n\nThis indicated that the video has been on the internet since 2015, therefore the incident is definitely not recent.\n\n\n\nIn the video, the man is asked about transporting cows for slaughter purpose, and the name of the buyer. The Logical Indian could not verify the source of the video. However, it is not recent and shows an incident of cow vigilantism.\n\n\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343.
