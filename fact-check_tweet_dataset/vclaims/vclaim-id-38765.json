Ms Dion then winds up her window.\n\nThis video has been edited. Perhaps the biggest giveaway that this is fake is not Ms Dion winding up the window, but the glimpse of her apparently sticking her middle finger up through the tinted glass.\n\nIn the original unedited video Ms Dion actually tells her driver to stay put so she can listen to the song, and then fist bumps the singer once she\u2019s finished.", "lang": "en"}
