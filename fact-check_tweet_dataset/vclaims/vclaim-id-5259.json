The estimated household cost increase following a \u201chard Brexit\u201d was \u00a3961, not \u00a31,961, and was calculated by consultancy Oliver Wyman, not think tank The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR).\n\nOliver Wyman estimated that a \u201chard Brexit\u201d scenario with World Trade Organisation tariffs would add 4%, or \u00a3961, onto average annual household costs. The Brexit scenario with the lowest impact on bills (a \u201cmoderate amount of red tape\u201d scenario\u201d) would increase annual household costs by 1% or \u00a3245, as the graphic correctly states.\n\nThe \u00a31,961 figure originates from a typo in an article by the Guardian which has since been corrected.\n\nThat article discussed both the Oliver Wyman report and a separate report by the IPPR looking at the possible effects of Brexit on income inequality, which may be the source of confusion.\n\nThe claims about the impact on lower-income and non-Londoners are a bit confused\n\nThe claim that IPPR said Brexit will have a disproportionately adverse impact on lower-income groups and regions outside London isn\u2019t quite right.\n\nIn fact the IPPR said that \u201cprice impacts have a broadly neutral effect on income inequality\u201d, adding that \u201cwhile Brexit is unlikely to worsen income inequality, all income groups \u2013 including the poorest - will face negative impacts.\u201d They do however note that lower income households have \u201cless of a \u2018buffer\u2019 to protect them from increased prices\u201d.\n\nThe Oliver Wyman report said a \u201chard Brexit\u201d scenario could increase costs for low-income households by 3% more than high income-households. They also said a different scenario, with increased labour costs, could flip that situation \u2013 with household costs for higher earners increasing by 4% more than for lower earners.\n\nAs for geographical inequality, the IPPR said the regional effects of Brexit on jobs are hard to determine with certainty but that \u201cmost studies suggest that in the long run it is areas outside London and the South East that are most likely to suffer from a downturn.\u201d\n\nWith regards to household costs, it estimated that regions outside London would be most affected saying: \u201cLondon is least affected because a greater proportion of households\u2019 expenditure goes on housing costs, which are not expected to be significantly impacted by Brexit.\u201d\n\nNevertheless it acknowledged dissenting views such as analysis from the London School of Economics which, on jobs, said that service sectors would be more negatively affected by Brexit than other sectors, and that because London and the South East have the highest concentration of services industries, those regions will be hit the hardest by Brexit.\n\nThe IPPR concluded by saying: \u201cOur analysis suggests that claims that Brexit will benefit the worst off or entrench inequalities further as too simplistic. The available research suggests that exiting the EU \u2013 in particular a hard Brexit \u2013 will have a negative GVA and price impact across different income groups, regions, genders and ethnicities, but it will not necessarily increase inequalities.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
