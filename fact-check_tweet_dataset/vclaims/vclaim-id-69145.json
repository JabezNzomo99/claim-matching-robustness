According to a UK-based website, a Harvard University research team came to those findings, but no study about this specific TV show was ever conducted.\n\nParents, be warned. \u201cA group of experts at Harvard University did a study revealing that Peppa Pig is one of the main causes of autism among children,\u201d according to a widely and persistently shared article originally published in June 2016.\n\nThe false Newsely article claims children who watch \u201cPeppa Pig\u201d are more likely to engage in \u201cadversarial, snide, questioning, confrontation, and disrespectful behavior.\u201d The reason for this, according to the fake study: the insubordinate attitude of the little girl pig and her brother George in the many episodes of the show, which supposedly influences children\u2019s psychological development.\n\nEarlier articles in the same vein wrote that the Harvard Study in question was conducted by researcher Marc Wildemberg. A quick search through Harvard University\u2019s department directories shows that no Marc Wildemberg worked at the Ivy League institution.\n\nAs for a potential study linking \u201cPeppa Pig\u201d to autism, JSTOR, a leading search engine for peer-reviewed scholarly articles, can only find one study mentioning \u201cPeppa Pig\u201d, which had no connection to autism, out of 2,400 academic journals worldwide.\n\nA similar Google Scholar search result shows no trace of studies linking autism and Peppa Pig.\n\nThe article, akin to other misleading media content that draw from prestigious research institutions to legitimize their claims, does not cite the name of the study. This is often the case when a cited study does not actually exist.", "lang": "en"}
