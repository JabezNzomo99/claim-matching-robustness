This information is especially important now that it is being contended that the spy ring was \u2018cultivated\u2019 in Dubai.\n\nThe three men who have been arrested from Bhopal are namely Dhruv Saxena, Mohit Agrawal and Manish Gandhi and have been accused of facilitating ISI by providing crucial information about Indian army deployments. While we have shown in our previous articles as to how Dhruv Saxena was the District Coordinator of BJYM Bhopal IT Cell, in this article we will further establish the close relationship between the above three people. We\u2019ll also establish as to how at least Dhruv Saxena and Mohit Agrawal have been associates of BJYM Bhopal President Anshul Tiwari for long.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s start with the relationship between Dhruv Saxena and Mohit Agarwal. According to their Facebook profile, Dhruv and Mohit have been friends since at least 2013.\n\nIt can be clearly seen that the two of them have been friends on Facebook since June 2013. They have multiple pictures together to further establish their closeness. In the picture below, Dhruv Saxena is on the left while Mohit Agrawal is in the centre.\n\nFurther, the following picture of Dhruv Saxena and Mohit Agrawal establishes their closeness with Anshul Tiwari who is the BJYM Bhopal President with Anshul Tiwari being close to all the top BJP leaders of Madhya Pradesh including the CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan.\n\nBJYM Bhopal President Anshul Tiwari\u2019s Facebook profile shows that he\u2019s friends with both Dhruv Saxena and Mohit Agrawal.\n\nIn fact, Anshul Tiwari has known both Dhruv Saxena and Mohit Agrawal for over 3 years based on their Facebook friendships.\n\nThe third accused Manish Gandhi is also close friends with BJYM Bhopal IT District Coordinator Dhruv Saxena based on their pictures to Dubai together. The following picture is Dhruv and Manish together in Dubai in \u201cOne and only Royal Mirage Arabian Court\u201d.\n\nHere\u2019s another picture of them in the same hotel with Dhruv on the left and Manish on the right.\n\nA quick search on Agoda shows that the above hotel is a really high-end hotel with rooms starting at Rs 30,000+.\n\nYet another picture of Manish Gandhi during the the above Dubai trip.\n\nThe above information should conclusively prove that the three accused Manish Gandhi, Mohit Agrawal and Dhruv Saxena are friends with each other and that Mohit Agrawal and Dhruv Saxena are linked to BJYM Bhopal President Anshul Tiwari with Dhruv Saxena himself being the District Coordinator of their IT Cell.", "lang": "en"}
