It is claimed that Amazon has become India\u2019s number one shopping website and is giving an opportunity to win prizes in its spin and win the contest of Great India Sale. A link is also being shared with the message. Vishwas News also received this claim for fact check on its fact-checking WhatsApp chatbot. Vishvas News investigated and found the post to be fake.\n\nThe viral message on social media shared in Hindi roughly translates to: Thank you for making Amazon India\u2019s number one shopping website. Amazon is now giving an opportunity to win prizes in its spin and win contest of Great India Sale. Click here to win: https://bit.ly/free-gift4-you . \u2018The screenshot of the message received on Whatsapp can be seen here:\n\nWe received a similar message on Facebook. A Facebook user named Aysha Khan shared the same claim with a different link. The archived version of his post can be viewed by clicking here.\n\nVishvas News started its investigation by clicking on the link shared in the posts. The link did not take us to Amazon\u2019s website. The link found on Facebook redirected to http://mrspin.in which is a gaming website whereas the link we received on WhatsApp message redirected us to another website.\n\nWe performed a Google Search using appropriate keywords (Amazon, Spin and win, Great India Sale etc.). We did not find any information related to Great India Sale. When Amazon organizes such an event, it is widely covered in media.\n\nWe contacted Amazon regarding the viral message on Twitter. Amazon replied from its official Twitter handle stating that the link is incorrect. Not only this, Amazon also warned to avoid clicking any such link or sharing your personal information. The response from Amazon on Twitter can be seen here:\n\nOne should beware of the clickbait links. In this regard, we spoke to Abhishek Pandey, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Uttar Pradesh. He said: \u201cUnverified and such clickbait links steal users\u2019 personal information and this can lead to financial fraud.\u201d\n\nWe performed the social scanning of the Facebook user Aysha Khan who shared the message on Facebook. According to the information given on her profile, the user is based out of Muzaffarnagar.\n\nVishvas News investigated and found that this message viral in the name of Amazon\u2019s Great Indian Sale is fake. It has nothing to do with Amazon. Clicking on such unverified and clickbait links can steal personal information.\n\nConclusion: Vishvas News investigated and found that this message viral in the name of Amazon\u2019s Great Indian Sale is fake. It has nothing to do with Amazon. Clicking on such unverified and clickbait links can steal personal information.", "lang": "en"}
