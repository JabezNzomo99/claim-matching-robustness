It publishes an annual review of the boards of the largest 150 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nMr Chisti\u2019s office told us that he was referring to Spencer Stuart\u2019s 2015 report, which also estimated about 5% representation across company boards. Business Insider reports that it drops to 4% if you exclude companies based in \u201cemerging market nations\u201d, although we didn't find this figure in the report itself.", "lang": "en"}
