Let\u2019s analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Congress President\u2019s approval is required to use funds from PMNRF. Fact: No such approval is required. On the PMNRF website, it can be read that the disbursement out of the fund is made at the discretion of the Prime Minister. Previously, the fund was managed by a committee (in which Congress President was a member), but in 1985, all the powers were transferred to the Prime Minister. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn the PMNRF website, it can be found that the fund was established in 1948. During its inception, a committee was formed to manage the fund. \u2018The President of the Indian National Congress\u2019 was one of the members of the managing committee. \n\n\n\nBut, currently, on the PMNRF website, it can read that \u2018the disbursement out of the fund is made at the discretion of the Prime Minister, and in accordance with the Prime Minister\u2019s directions\u2019. So, no approval is required from the Congress President.\n\nIn a Delhi Hight Court Judgement, it can be read that \u2018in 1985, the Managing Committee of PMNRF entrusted the entire management of the said fund to the Prime minister who was given the discretion to appoint a secretary of the fund to manage it\u2019.\n\nFACTLY has written a detailed explainer article on \u2018PMNRF Vs PM CARES\u2019. It can be read here.\n\nTo sum it up, Congress President\u2019s approval is not required to disburse funds from PMNRF.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
