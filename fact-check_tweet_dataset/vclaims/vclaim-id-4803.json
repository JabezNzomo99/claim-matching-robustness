Bonuses were also off the table. (\n\nThe infographic has been\n\n, but it is not clear who produced it.\n\nEskom\u2019s 2003 annual report states that as of 31 December 2003 it had\n\n, however. Its 2016/17 annual report states that it is \u201ctargeting a reduction in the Eskom company workforce to 36,746\u201d by the 2021/22 financial year.\n\nHow many employees should Eskom have?\n\nlooked at the financial viability of electricity sectors in 39 sub-Saharan African countries.\n\nIt found that in 2014, South Africa\u2019s power utility had the largest workforce out of the 39 countries - at 41,787. It also had the largest number of customers: just over 5.4 million.\n\nThe World Bank\u2019s analysis of staffing levels estimated that Eskom only needed a workforce of 14,244 people. One assumption in the calculation was that in developing countries, there should be one employee for every 413 electricity customers.\n\nThe World Bank did point out that these exercises have limitations.\n\n\u201cThis benchmarking analysis is necessarily simplified to be able to cover dozens of countries for cross-country comparison,\u201d it explained. \u201cResults for any individual country should not be used as a substitute for an indepth country-level analysis.\u201d\n\nWhat does Eskom do?\n\nBenchmarking needs to be conducted and interpreted with care, cautioned Prof Anton Eberhard from the\n\n. He has done research on the restructuring and regulation of the electricity sector and was part of a\n\n\u201cA lot of the utilities that the World Bank benchmarked Eskom against do everything. They generate electricity, they transmit it and they sell electricity to the end users,\u201d he explained.\n\nEskom, however, does not distribute all its electricity. Half of it is sold to municipalities who manage the distribution.\n\n\u201cWhat that would suggest is that Eskom is over-employing. The fact that it doesn't even have a full distribution business means that it is definitely over-staffed.\u201d\n\nThis showed that Eskom was able to produce 239,109 gigawatt hours (GWh) with 32,954 employees in 2007/08, or 7.26 GWh per employee. The power utility has said that it plans to produce 216,771 GWh with 39,186 employees in 2018/19, which works out to 5.3 GWh per employee.\n\n\u201cThis means that Eskom is producing less GWh with more employees and higher employee costs,\u201d Nersa said.\n\nBased on these figures, Nersa suggested that Eskom was employing 6,232 more people than it needed to.\n\n, Eskom said it was arbitrary to benchmark its output by GWh produced per employee and to choose 2007/08 as a base year. The power utility argued that, in that year, demand outstripped supply to such an extent that load shedding had to be introduced.\n\n\u201cPower stations were required to operate at output levels well above their design parameters or industry norms, thus artificially reducing the ratio of staff to electricity output,\u201d Eskom explained.\n\nThough staff benchmarking figures may differ, Eberhard said the estimates provided insight into the efficiency of a utility.\n\nBoth the infographic and other sources have recently made claims about the \u201caverage salary\u201d at Eskom.\n\nThe National Union of Mineworkers \u2013 which represents mine, construction and energy workers \u2013\n\nthese numbers, saying that their \u201cmembers do not earn that kind of money\u201d.\n\n. This number divided by 31,972 employees equals R241,993 per employee, more than the R220,000 stated in the infographic.\n\nBy 2017, Eskom\u2019s staff costs had increased to\n\n. Divided equally between 47,658 employees, this comes to R772,861 per employee, slightly less than the R780,000 stated in the infographic.\n\nThe infographic suggests the \u201caverage salary\u201d at Eskom increased by R560,000 between 2003 and 2017. This is an exaggeration, as the the actual increase was R530,868.\n\nLooking at the pay scale\n\nOf course, staff costs are not split equally between all employees. But energy analyst Chris Yelland said the average was worth considering.\n\nEskom\u2019s financial statements do not, however, provide a breakdown of pay levels.\n\nthe salaries of the power utility\u2019s bargaining unit employees. These are the\n\nwhose salaries are negotiated between unions and Eskom management.\n\nThe documents show that employees on the unit\u2019s lowest salary scale earn R135,390 per year and those on the highest R595,410 per year.\n\nThe infographic claimed that Eskom\u2019s electricity production remained at 1.8 terawatt hours (TWh) from 2003 to 2017. This is equal to 1,800 GWh.\n\nthat year. This is equal to 210 TWh. By 2017, Eskom\u2019s production stood only slightly higher at\n\nThe infographic\u2019s output numbers are therefore incorrect. It suggests that Eskom produces 122 times less than it actually does. It also doesn\u2019t show that there has been a small increase in production between 2003 and 2017.\n\nBut electricity production in more recent years has decreased - rather than staying flat. Production peaked as high as\n\nWhile production is down from 10 years ago, Yelland told Africa Check that Eskom is meeting demand levels.\n\n\u201cThe reduction in demand each year is related to the high price of electricity, which has been driving customers to use electricity more sparingly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has also put some energy-intensive companies out of business.\u201d\n\nEskom has become less efficient at generating electricity, however. \u201cStaff costs have been going up like a rocket while production volumes are going down,\u201d Yelland said.", "lang": "en"}
