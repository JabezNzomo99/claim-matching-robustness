Because the report is silent on the question of whether the election was swayed, Trump officials falsely state there is \u201cno evidence\u201d that the Russian efforts succeeded.\n\nGiven Trump\u2019s narrow election victory \u2014 just a switch of 40,000 votes in three states would have altered the outcome \u2014 analysts can point to any number of factors. Clinton\u2019s email controversy \u2014 and the FBI investigation that resulted \u2013 was certainly a major drag on her electoral prospects. But at the same time, during the campaign Trump repeatedly seized on revelations made by WikiLeaks (which U.S. intelligence says came via Russia) to attack Clinton.\n\nAn FBI special agent tried to contact the DNC in September 2015, but he was transferred to a tech-support contractor on the help desk. But after an initial conversation \u2014 indicating that the FBI had information there was at least one compromised computer on the DNC\u2019s network \u2014 the contractor did not return repeated phone calls, thinking he had been the subject of a prank call, the New York Times reported.\n\nSecond, emails leaked by WikiLeaks indicate that Podesta\u2019s Windows 8 login was \u201cp@ssword.\u201d Perhaps that is why Preibus was careful to use the word \u201csystem,\u201d although from the context of his remarks he seemed to be referring to Podesta\u2019s Gmail account \u2014 because that was what the Russians are said to have hacked. Just before he mentioned Podesta\u2019s email, he asserted that \u201cthe reason this particular hack was so large wasn\u2019t necessarily because the effort was so great by the Russians. It was that it was so easy.\u201d\n\nThey may have a point, but the two situations are not directly comparable. The Russian campaign, as described by U.S. intelligence, involved more than just hacking, with the aim of disrupting and possibly influencing the political process. The Chinese hack had a more isolated goal \u2014 espionage. China appears to have wanted the material in order to engage in possible blackmail.\n\nU.S. officials also say that China responded to U.S. pressure after the hack was discovered, and there are signs its espionage activities have been reduced. Timing is often important in diplomacy: China may have been receptive to U.S. pressure at the time because President Xi Jinping was about to visit the United States, and he did not want the hack to mar the visit. China even announced it had arrested the alleged hackers. (Obama had signed an executive order that could have been used to issue sanctions against China for the attack.)\n\n\u201cWe did not retaliate against an act of espionage any more than other countries necessarily retaliate against us for when we conduct espionage,\u201d Clapper told lawmakers. \u201cPeople who live in glass houses need to think about throwing rocks. Because this was an act of espionage and, you know, we and other nations conduct similar acts of espionage. So if we\u2019re going to punish each other for acts of espionage, that\u2019s a different policy issue.\u201d\n\nWhen the United States exposed a Russian spy ring in 2010, discovering agents who had embedded themselves in U.S. society, the spies were arrested and eventually became part of a spy swap between the two countries. No sanctions were imposed \u2013 though that was also during the period when Obama was trying to \u201creset\u201d relations with Russia.", "lang": "en"}
