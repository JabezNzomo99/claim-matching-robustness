(Short answer from Slobodien: The administration is still trying to roll back the Clean Air Act.) We also did not understand why several statutory actions, such as reducing the individual mandate to zero, were included. More than one-tenth of the claimed savings stemmed from rolling back the individual mandate. (Short answer: Major deregulatory steps often come from statutes, not rulemaking.)\n\nBut market competition may have also been a factor. A major price war broke out among wireless carriers after Verizon announced it would join in offering unlimited data plans first advanced by T-Mobile. Numerous articles at the time attributed the drop in prices to the price war; none mentioned the repeal of the opt-in rule. The Wall Street Journal quoted an analyst as saying the steep drop in the cost of wireless service was because of \u201cthe price war that has broken out among cell-phone service providers, with all the big providers now offering unlimited data plans at cheaper rates.\u201d\n\nThe price war has continued, but the CEA says that is the result of deregulation. \u201cThe data show that U.S. consumers enjoy a lasting price reduction, which suggests that something has occurred to permanently enhance competition or reduce costs,\u201d Slobodien said. \u201cEconomic theory predicts and economic history has shown the deregulation can do exactly that. As you know, a price war, or at least a price cut that lasts permanently, does not happen just on a whim of one of the companies. It is the result of deregulation.\u201d\n\nEven if one accepted all of CEA\u2019s numbers, the report does not look at the other side of the ledger \u2014 actions taken by the administration that have reduced household income. For instance, Federal Reserve Bank of New York officials peg Trump\u2019s tariffs as already costing the typical U.S. household $831 a year. David Henderson of the Hoover Institution, who otherwise praised the report, made this observation: \u201cI wonder, though, what the numbers would look like if they included the negative effects on real income of increased restrictions on immigration and increased restrictions on trade with Iran.\u201d (He did not count the tariffs because he considers them to be taxes, not regulation.)", "lang": "en"}
