No, that's not true: It is a completely made-up story that first appeared online on a now-defunct website in 2006, but copied and shared over the past dozen years. The people named in the story do not exist and the sheriff in the county where it purportedly happened confirmed it was a hoax.\n\nRecent incarnations include a post (archived here) shared on Facebook September 21, 2019 under the title \"11 YEAR-OLD WHO SHOT ILLEGALS\".

In fact, FOX News has never reported the story for the same reason no others did: It is a hoax.", "lang": "en"}
