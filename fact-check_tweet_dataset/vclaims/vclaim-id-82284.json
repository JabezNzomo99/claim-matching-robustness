Dowd, who still lives in Santa Clara County, confirmed this account to The Fact Checker. George Marcus and Bill Millichap said in a statement that they encouraged her \u201cto pursue a career as an investment real estate agent with our company. She ultimately went back to school and her career took a different path. Our experience with her was very positive.\u201d\n\nShe returned to the U.S., went to see the school\u2019s dean, asked him to accept her and wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. The dean recalled her asking: \u201cSo, can a liberal arts student from Stanford compete with the analytical jocks you have around here?\u201d according to \u201cBackfire: Carly Fiorina\u2019s High-Stakes Battle for the Soul of Hewlett-Packard,\u201d a 2003 book by journalist Peter Burrows. The dean was impressed, and accepted her. He recommended her to join the management track at AT&T upon graduation.\n\nFiorina got the job, and started as a sales representative in 1980. She was promoted to her first management position two years later. She moved to AT&T\u2019s federal systems procurement arm, where she met Lou Golm, the vice president of federal systems. Golm recommended Fiorina to one of the most prestigious and elite mid-career management fellowships in the world, at the Sloan School of Management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Golm also had graduated from the program, whose alumni network includes former U.N. secretary general Kofi Annan and Ford Motors Chief Executive Bill Ford.\n\nAt Sloan, she was introduced to the world of senior managers, meeting with and learning from chief executives of various companies. She described the year as a \u201cgreat luxury \u2014 a sudden intermission in our lives when we could change the pace, tempo and nature of how we spent our days,\u201d learning with other \u201cvery driven, type A overachievers who were focused on goals and accomplishments.\u201d She realized she could become a chief executive herself one day. Through her fellowship, Fiorina earned her second master\u2019s degree in business administration, and she was placed on a senior management track at AT&T.\n\nBut the description glosses over important details. Her father was dean of Duke Law School when she was at Stanford, meaning Duke would have paid for most of her college tuition. She graduated from Stanford, and her elite degree played a role in the stories of her at Marcus & Millichap (she was the \u201cStanford student\u201d) and her convincing the business school dean to accept her into the MBA program (\u201cSo, can a liberal arts student from Stanford compete with the analytical jocks you have around here?\u201d).", "lang": "en"}
