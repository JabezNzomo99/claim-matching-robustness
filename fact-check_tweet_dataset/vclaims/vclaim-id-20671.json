No, that's not true: an old internet hoax story was recently resurrected by a website that specializes in \"fauxtire\" (i.e. faux satire), it did not happen for real.\n\nThe story reappeared in an article published by 8Shit on June 5, 2018 titled \"76-year Old Mom Kicked Out Of KFC For Breastfeeding Her 42-year Old Son\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nA 76 year old woman has created much controversy last week, by breast-feeding her 42-year-old son in the middle of a KFC restaurant. Many customers in the restaurant complained about the incident to management. Linda Berrety and her son Michael, were finally escorted out by the restaurant management. But not before he fed on her for nearly 15 minutes. The unusual episode has sparked strong reactions on social media and provoked a huge debate on the limits of breast-feeding in public places.\n\nThe original story came from Daily Buzz Live, where it was published in April of 2015 (and from where it has been frequently copied by other sites since then):\n\nThe people in the picture weren't even mother and son, they were lovers featured in a show about couples with massive age gaps:\n\nShe's 79, He's 39: New Show About (Massive) Age Gaps Proves Love Can Flourish Anywhere From Channel 5, which brought us the unforgettable Guys And Dolls documentary, it is easy to take a cynical approach to the love stories told in the show Age Gap Love. But for 79-year-old Edna, who met husband 39-year-old Simon nine years ago, both say it was love at first sight, when they bonded over a passion for organ music.\n\nFurthermore, 8shit.net carries a disclaimer on its about page that reads:\n\nAnd an additional disclaimer in the footer of every page:\n\n8Shit is a satire news and humor website.
