While multiple reasons could be at play for this, a theory that has come up is that a more \u2018virulent\u2019 or deadlier strain of the novel coronavirus may be responsible for the difference in severity.\n\nA PTI report quoted doctors in Indore as saying, \u201cWe have a feeling the strain is definitely more virulent in Indore belt. We have discussed this with the NIV and will be sending samples for them to compare by extraction of virus genome.\u201d\n\nSimilar reports were published for Gujarat\u2019s high number of cases and to explain India\u2019s death rates - where the low mortality in the country was attributed to a \u2018less virulent\u2019 strain of the virus.\n\nBut do such variations in the virus\u2019 virulence exist? FIT spoke to two leading virologists who said that there is no basis to show that a particular mutation of the virus is deadlier than the other. Let\u2019s evaluate the evidence.", "lang": "en"}
