The claim is false; the video shows an incident on a different bridge in the Chinese city of Humen in Guangdong province.\n\nThe video has been shared more than 1,000 times after it was posted on Facebook on May 7, 2020.\n\nThe 14-second video shows the surface of a bridge appearing to ripple like waves.\n\nThe post\u2019s Javanese-language caption translates to English as: \u201cSister, is this true? it is said that this is the Macau-Hongkong bridge. It is on TV this morning...the bridge looks like it is breathing.\u201d\n\nThe video was also shared on Facebook alongside a similar claim in Javanese here and here; and here in Indonesian.\n\nThe claim is false; the video shows a bridge in the Chinese city of Humen in Guangdong province.\n\nA Google reverse image search for a screenshot of the video found a longer version of the clip was embedded in this report published by Hong Kong newspaper The Standard on May 5, 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the The Standard\u2019s report:\n\nThe report reads in part: \u201cPeople were getting the shakes along a stretch of the Pearl River yesterday.\n\n\u201cThat came as Guangzhou authorities suspended traffic on the 3,618-meter Humen Pearl River Bridge, which connects the Nansha district and Humen town in Dongguan city. For it shook so much it set off ripples along the river. Some bridge-crossers said it felt like they were on a small boat. Such reports alarmed the city's transport department to the extent that the bridge was closed at 3.32pm.\u201d\n\nThe 43-second video was posted on YouTube on May 5, 2020. The video's simplified Chinese-language title translates to English as: \u201cHumen bridge\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison between the clip in the misleading post (L) and the YouTube video (R):\n\nNansha district is located in Guangzhou, a city in Guangdong province, China.\n\nThe bridge can be seen in this image tagged to Google Maps.\n\nThe same incident was also covered by China\u2019s state-run broadcaster China Global Television Network (CGTN) here and Hong Kong-based news outlet the South China Morning Post here.\n\nThis is the location of the Humen Pearl River Bridge on Google Maps.\n\nAnother bridge, the 55-km-long Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, connects Hong Kong and Macau.\n\nThis is the location of the bridge at one end in Hong Kong on Google Maps.", "lang": "en"}
