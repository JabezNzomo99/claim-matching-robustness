In all of His teachings about multiple things \u2026 [Jesus] never said that gay people should be condemned.\u201d\n\nThese words are correctly attributed to former president Carter. They originated with an interview of Carter by HuffPost editor Paul Brandeis Raushenbush in March 2012, while the former was promoting the publication of his book \u201cNIV Lessons from Life Bible: Personal Reflections with Jimmy Carter.\u201d\n\nIn response to a question about people citing the Bible as a reason for declining to accept gays, Carter responded by noting that Jesus \u201cnever said that gay people should be condemned.\u201d Carter added that he felt \u201cgay people [should be able to] be married in civil ceremonies\u201d:\n\nQ: A lot of people point to the Bible for reasons why gay people should not be in the church, or accepted in any way. A: Homosexuality was well known in the ancient world, well before Christ was born and Jesus never said a word about homosexuality. In all of his teachings about multiple things \u2014 he never said that gay people should be condemned. I personally think it is very fine for gay people to be married in civil ceremonies. I draw the line, maybe arbitrarily, in requiring by law that churches must marry people. I\u2019m a Baptist, and I believe that each congregation is autonomous and can govern its own affairs. So if a local Baptist church wants to accept gay members on an equal basis, which my church does by the way, then that is fine. If a church decides not to, then government laws shouldn\u2019t require them to.", "lang": "en"}
