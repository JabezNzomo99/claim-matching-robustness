Dont know how many are going to commit suicide after seeing this.\u201d\n\nThe above message claims that a mosque in Bengaluru has been named after Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It has been tweeted by a user @mahesh10816, who is followed on the platform by PM Modi himself.\n\nThe above tweet has been retweeted over 400 times. Two photographs have been posted along with it. In the photo on the left, the words \u2018Modi Masjid\u2019 can be seen written at the entrance of what appears to be a mosque. In the photo on the right, a poster of PM Modi can be seen in the background. The aforementioned claim has gone viral on WhatsApp as well.\n\nAlt News found that there is indeed a Modi masjid in Bengaluru, but it has NOT been named after Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It has been named after a samaritan named Modi Abdul Gafoor, and was established more than 175 years back. The mosque was recently renovated, which is why it was in the news. It is in the Shivaji Nagar area of the city.\n\nInsofar as the two photographs in the above tweet are concerned, while the photo on the left is indeed of the Modi mosque in Bengaluru (NOT named after PM Modi), the photo on the right could not be conclusively established. However, it is not of the Modi mosque. The poster in the background shows PM Modi visit to the Ashara Mubaraka event at Indore in 2018.\n\nThe claim that a mosque in Bengaluru has been named after PM Narendra Modi, is false.", "lang": "en"}
