But they\u2019re not helpful if you don\u2019t understand how to read polls, or if you rely on unreliable polls. A good poll that actually represents a diverse nation tends to be from a random sample and needs to have a rigorous methodology.\n\nWe checked with Scott Clement, polling manager at The Washington Post. He cited four polls that have been completed on the debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton at Washington University in St. Louis on Oct. 9.\n\nClement said that the best-quality post-debate poll so far was CNN\u2019s immediate post-debate survey, which was conducted by calling back respondents to its previous national telephone survey who said they would watch the debate. That survey was conducted among a national random sample of cellular and landline phones, so it has the best claim of representativeness.\n\nClement noted that the sample was more Democratic, as this group was more likely to have watched the debate, but the partisan balance was not so far different from the general public.\n\nAnother debate-night survey was done by YouGov, which relies on opt-in Internet panels to recruit respondents and is not based on a random sample of the public. This kind of poll is viewed with suspicion by many in the polling community, but YouGov\u2019s method has produced reasonably accurate pre-election surveys in the past.\n\nThere was also a Morning Consult-Politico poll, which also uses an opt-in panel that weights the sample by demographics, though it is a newcomer and does not have a track record of pre-election estimates like YouGov.\n\nSo four polls, of varying quality but certainly respectable, all show that Clinton won. So what is Trump talking about? This tweet gives the answer.\n\nThese polls are all \u201cgarbage polls,\u201d as our colleague Philip Bump calls them. These are Internet polls that did not attempt to recruit a representative sample of the country and are open to anyone, even people in Russia. All you need is an Internet connection. So they are representative of nothing, not even enthusiasm.\n\nTrump claims \u201cevery poll\u201d shows that he won the second debate \u201cin a landslide.\u201d In reality, not a single quality poll shows he won the debate, though one indicated a near-tie.
