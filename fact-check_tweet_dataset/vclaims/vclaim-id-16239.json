Over the last decade, there\u2019s been stagnation, but \u201ccollapse\u201d is a stretch if that\u2019s what\u2019s being referred to.\n\nDisposable income is what households bring in after deducting certain taxes, like income tax.\n\nOfficial figures tell you a lot about the \u2018average\u2019 household over time and give some breakdowns, for example splitting everyone into groups from richest to poorest. But there\u2019s no handy definition for \u2018ordinary working people\u2019.\n\nIn general, disposable incomes in the UK rose from the mid 1990s till the mid-2000s, and have broadly stagnated since.\n\nAs the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist put it a few months ago: \u201cHalf of all UK households have seen no material recovery in their real disposable incomes since around 2005.\u201d\n\nThe Bank\u2019s own calculations show the trend since the recession in the late noughties. Disposable incomes are not far from where they were for the highest and lowest earning households now compared to before the downturn. In fact, the poorest fifth of households fared better than the richest during the downturn, on this measure.\n\nStagnating incomes arguably mean years of lost earnings for a lot of people, compared to what \u2018could have been\u2019 if the trends in the early noughties had held. But if that is the argument, 15 years looks like the wrong timeframe to be using.", "lang": "en"}
