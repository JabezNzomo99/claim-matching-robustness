That\u2019s correct for the UK, according to data from the Department of Health and Social Care. He was also correct to say that is the lowest since lockdown began on 24 March.\n\nTechnically this is the number of deaths that were reported in the 24 hours to 5pm on 31 May.\n\nMr Hancock also said 39,045 people had died overall, and his presentation slides at the time showed the same. But as the post we\u2019re checking claims, in the briefing the day before, the cumulative total was reported at the time as 38,489. The difference between these figures is 556, and not 111.\n\nThe reason for this discrepancy is that the total figure was updated between these two briefings, to include additional deaths from late April and May.\n\n445 lab-confirmed Covid-19 case deaths were added to the total by 1 June\n\nIn the notes section of its coronavirus cases guidance, the government said: \u201cThe cumulative totals for deaths have been revised to include an additional 445 deaths.\n\n\u201cThese additional deaths are from the period 26 April to 31 May. The daily total today is unaffected.\n\n\u201cOur published daily series has been revised to show when these deaths were reported.\u201d\n\nIn the small print in the data release for the 1 June press briefing, it says that the additional 445 deaths were just in England, and from the period 24 April to 31 May. We checked with the Department for Health and Social Care, and it said that the small print should have said 26 April to 31 May.\n\nIt goes on to say:\n\n\u201cFigures still relate to those who have died, in any setting, having had a positive lab confirmed test. As the testing programme expands, work has been conducted to integrate individual level data on laboratory confirmed cases for Pillar 2 (commercial partner testing) into the central repository of laboratory results that [Public Health England] uses. This additional data flow has enabled PHE to incorporate the matching of additional laboratory confirmed cases, from Pillar 2, into their process, thereby increasing the number of deaths for which a positive, confirmed test exists. PHE have revised their daily series to show when these deaths were reported.)\u201d\n\nSo the extra deaths come from fatal cases confirmed to have Covid-19 by labs not operated by the NHS or Public Health England. We asked the Department for Health and Social Care whether any more of this data will continue to be updated with backlogged fatalities and a spokesperson told us: \"All deaths before 24 May 2020 of people who tested positive through 'pillar 2' testing are included in the reported daily figure for 24 May 2020.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
