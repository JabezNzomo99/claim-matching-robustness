But in recent years, some countries have consolidated their operations in single locations, but with separate buildings, primarily for security reasons.\n\nIsrael, for instance, locates its embassy to the Holy See right next to its embassy to Italy; one building is at Via Michele Mercati 12 and the other building is at Via Michele Mercati 14. After a 2003 terrorist attack on its consulate in Istanbul, Britain also decided to move its embassy to the Holy See to the same address \u2014 Via XX Settembre 80A \u2014 as its Rome embassy. But the British ambassador to the Vatican works out of a separate building on the property with its own entrance.\n\nIn March, Undersecretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy signed an action memo that would move the embassy to the same diplomatic compound as the embassy to Italy, which is slightly closer to the Vatican. The transfer would follow the British model: The U.S. ambassador to the Holy See and the embassy staff would be housed in a separate building, with a different entrance and address: Via Sallustiana 49. (The embassy to Italy, around the corner, is at Vittorio Veneto 121.) The U.S. Mission to the United Nations in Rome is already on the same property, with its own building, entrance and address (Via Boncompagni 2), having moved there last year.\n\nState Department officials say Kennedy made a routine notice to the White House about his decision, but this was strictly an internal State Department matter. Kennedy was following the recommendations of a 2008 IG report, released during the Bush administration, which urged moving the embassy for both cost and security reasons \u2014 as well as practicality. The report said the Vatican embassy structure (known as a chancery), which at the time cost nearly $1 million a year to lease and provide security, was poorly designed to work as an office building.\n\n\u201cThe main meeting room is open to the lobby, the only staircase is spiral and narrow, and the office space for most of the American officers is small and affords no privacy,\u201d the report said. It called on State to \u201cdevelop and implement a plan to relocate to the Embassy Rome compound, as soon as possible, with an eye towards cost savings, improved security, and maintaining as much as possible its separate identity to include a separate street address.\u201d\n\nIt all started with a Nov. 20 report by John L. Allen Jr., the well-sourced Rome correspondent of the National Catholic Reporter, who wrote that the move was \u201cdrawing fire from five former American envoys despite the tacit consent of the Vatican itself.\u201d Allen\u2019s account is thorough and balanced, quoting a number of former U.S. ambassadors, Republican and Democrat, who said they feared that being perceived as an adjunct of the Rome embassy threatened to degrade the importance of the Vatican embassy.\n\nThat argument still might have resonance if other countries, such as the United Kingdom, had not since consolidated facilities, passing muster with the Vatican by maintaining different entrances. CNN quoted Vatican officials as saying that they understood the security concerns and had accepted the shift, as long as the address and entrance remain different. (One unidentified official was quoted as saying the move was \u201can exception, not the ideal, but not the end of the world.\u201d)\n\n\u201cThe United States is a global superpower with an obligation to ensure we have a strong relationship with the Vatican. The fact remains that five former U.S. representatives to the Vatican (from both parties) are deeply concerned about the move, as are tens of thousands of Catholics,\u201d Dayspring said. As for the claim that the administration had an anti-religion agenda, he added: \u201cWe don\u2019t expect everyone to agree with the statement, but it is something that people believe and feel. It is a commentary on administration policy, not a statement of fact.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
