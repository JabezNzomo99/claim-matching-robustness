With it was the claim that city officials in Tokyo, where the 2020 Olympics were scheduled to be held before being delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, had decided to set off the decorative explosives because they could no longer store them:\n\nThis is not a genuine video from Tokyo of a fireworks display meant for the 2020 Olympics. In fact, this isn\u2019t a genuine video of fireworks at all. These fireworks are actually the result of a piece of fireworks-simulation software, and this video is several years old.\n\nThe video was created circa 2015 with a computer program called FWsim. This program allows users to generate custom (and digital) fireworks displays. A description from the FWsim website reads:\n\nThe footage in the \u201cTokyo Olympic Fireworks\u201d video has been online since at least 2015 when it was posted to YouTube under the title \u201cFWsim Mount Fuji Synchronized Fireworks Show2.\u201d The original video has been viewed more than 3 million times:\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time a simulated fireworks show made with FWsin has fooled unsuspecting internet users. In 2015, we covered a similar video that supposedly showed fireworks from China\u2019s New Year celebrations.", "lang": "en"}
