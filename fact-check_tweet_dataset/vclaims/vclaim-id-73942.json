Kamala Harris, a Democrat from California, as his choice for running mate in the upcoming U.S. presidential election.\n\nIn Russia, the overall reaction to Harris has been negative. But it goes further. Even the most neutral comments by politicians and media commentators about Harris have included some racist and sexist language.\n\nAleksei Pushkov, chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the Federation Council, the upper chamber of Russia\u2019s parliament, wrote on Telegram that Harris \u201cis nothing special\u201d and that Biden\u2019s choice was motivated by three reasons only: her gender, her skin color and her mixed Black-Hindu heritage.\n\nWhat stands out is the language the Russian state media use in describing Harris and, in particular, the way English-language commentaries are translated into Russian for the domestic audience.\n\nIn its breaking news report on Aug. 12, Russian state-owned TV - Channel 1 described Kamala Harris as a politician who \u201csupported the anti-Russian hysteria about so-called Russian interference in the American elections.\u201d\n\nThe anchor reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had \u201calready reacted in his usual manner, calling her even more disgusting [\u2018omerzitel\u2019noi\u2019] than the previous candidate for the position, Elizabeth Warren, who he degradingly called Pocahontas.\u201d\n\nDuring an Aug. 11 press briefing, Trump repeatedly called Harris \u201cnasty\u201d and \u201cextraordinarily nasty\u201d and \u201cprobably even nastier than Pocahontas.\u201d\n\nHowever, in translating the word \u201cnasty,\u201d Channel 1 misleadingly used the much more negative Russian word \u201comerzitel\u2019ny.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor \u2018nasty\u2019, people usually say \u2018protivny\u2019, it\u2019s almost like a bound phrase,\u201d veteran Russia watcher and professional interpreter Catherine Ann Fitzpatrick, who has translated over 50 books from Russian into English and vice versa, told Polygraph.info. \u201cAnd \u2018omerzitel\u2019ny\u2019 is already \u2018disgusting\u2019 or \u2018repulsive\u2019 \u2013 that much stronger.\u201d\n\nNone of the academic dictionaries Polygraph.info checked translates \u201cnasty\u201d as \u201comerzitel\u2019ny.\u201d That includes the Cambridge dictionary, the professional linguistic source Lingue, and the online dictionary Reverso.\n\nNeither does the popular Google Translate.\n\nThe only two online translation services that list \u201comerzitel\u2019ny\u201d as one of the possible translations of \u201cnasty\u201d are Russia\u2019s popular search engine Yandex.ru and a Russian version of the website Multitran. The latter is a sort of a linguistic Wikipedia for translators, to which anybody can add their translations of any word.\n\n\u201cOmersitel\u2019ny\u201d seems to be one of the latest additions to Multitran\u2019s Russian translations of \u201cnasty.\u201d It was submitted by a user identified as \u201cOlga P.\u201d A freelance translator using that same profile name offers services via several professional platforms, including the website Upwork.com. The person did not respond to an inquiry from Polygraph.info about the authorship of the Multitran entry, so we were unable to confirm whether the two user profiles are the same person.\n\nWhen asked why Channel 1 translators would choose such an inappropriate word for \u201cnasty\u201d, Fitzpatrick said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if this proves intent, but it does seem like they are upping the ante.\u201d\n\nWhile Russian media outlets all reported Trump\u2019s comments about Harris, only state-owned media seemed to have original reports with the word \u201cnasty\u201d translated as \u201comerzitel\u2019ny.\u201d That includes the two main state news agencies - RIA Novosti and TASS.\n\nThe translations of Trump\u2019s comment about Harris used by RIA Novosti and TASS are identical, as if they were copy-pasted from the same source.\n\nBy way of context, the 2015 Hollywood blockbuster \u201cThe Hateful 8\u201d was released in Russia under the name \u201cOmerzitel\u2019naya vos\u2019merka.\u201d\n\nRIA Novosti\u2019s front page report about Kamala Harris was headlined: \u201cThe Washington swamp puts forward its own Putin against Trump.\u201d\n\nThe commentary is full of minor inaccuracies. In addition, Harris\u2019 husband, Douglas Emhoff, is described as a \u201ca lawyer of Jewish origin.\u201d The report portrays Harris as \u201cnot too decent, not too trustworthy,\u201d with \u201cextravagant views on foreign policy,\u201d and an \u201calmost-doppelganger\u201d of Putin with the ability to \u201chypnotize Trump, just like the Russian does.\u201d\n\nWriting in the Russian website Business FM, Anton Korobkov, a political studies professor at the University of Tennessee and a member of the Russian International Affairs Council, described Harris as Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdangerous choice\u201d for vice president whose main attributes are \u201cuntrustworthiness\u201d and a \u201cnear-insane hunger for power.\u201d\n\nThe Russian international Sputnik featured a commentary that described Biden as \u201cscum\u201d and Harris as \u201cObama in a skirt,\u201d who \u201cwill always be on top of grandpa Biden.\u201d A long, mocking reflection on how Harris\u2019 skin color served to her advantage, the commentary referred to the Black Lives Matter movement, concluding that, in today\u2019s America, \u201cthose are the only lives that matter.\u201d\n\nNezavisimaya Gazeta, one of Russia\u2019s most openly pro-Putin newspapers, featured an article headlined: \u201cBiden decided to preserve his advantage over Trump with the help of a leftist negress.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
