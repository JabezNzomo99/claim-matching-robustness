Readers emailed it to Rappler for verification.\n\nA quick reverse image search revealed that the aircraft carrier in the meme is actually the USS Gerald R. Ford, a $13-billion US Navy warship which was commissioned in Norfolk, Virginia, in July 2017.\n\nAs of April 2018, there are only 20 active aircraft carriers operating around the world, according to Business Insider. These carriers are from Brazil, China, France, India, Italy, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the US, and Russia.\n\nTwitter user Boom Buencamino, which has around 5,000 followers, claims his account is a satire. He also seems to be supporting the Liberal Party. From his responses to his tweet, it appears that he indeed meant the post to be satirical.\n\nBuencamino's post also included a manipulated version of the Philippine Navy's actual logo which features a sea lion holding a sword atop an anchor. Instead of the sea lion, it featured a man riding on a jet ski, an apparent allusion to President Duterte's unfulfillled campaign promise that he would ride a jet ski to assert the Philippines' rights over the West Philippine Sea.\n\nComments in response to the Facebook post are a mix: while some said the post is fake, others praised the President for good performance. Some even prayed that God will always love and guide him. \u2013 Addie Pobre/ Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
