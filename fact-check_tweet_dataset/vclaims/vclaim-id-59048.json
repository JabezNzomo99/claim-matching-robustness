As of writing, the post has gained at least 1,000 reactions, 96 comments, and 1,100 shares.\n\nThe article published on June 7, 2017 attributes this quote to a certain CHED Assistant Commissioner Dr Fausta Salcedo: \u201cEngineering board exams mostly deal with solving problems and numbers, doctor\u2019s exam deals only with the human body, BAR deals primarily with the Philippine Constitution. Teachers deal with everything from what a child has learned when he started going to school at Grade 1 until he finished college.\"\n\nHowever, according to CHED chairman Prospero de Vera III, in 2017, there was no CHED Commissioner by the name of Fausta Salcedo. In addition, CHED has no \"assistant commissioner\" position and there was no one with that name who served the agency. De Vera also labeled the article as \"fake.\"\n\nIn October 2017, then CHED chairperson Patricia Licuanan said the poor performance of schools for teachers in the LET was due to several factors like the need to upgrade the curriculum, schools' admission standards, and difficulty in monitoring teacher education programs.\n\nIn the past, the website has been fact-checked by Rappler and Vera Files. Some of its false articles include one that claimed the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) condemned the killing of two terrorist leaders in Marawi and another that claimed former president Benigno \"Ninoy\" Aquino III jeered at President Rodrigo Duterte over the time it took to kill those terrorists. The CBCP also flagged OKD2.com as a website that carries \"fake or unverified contents.\" \u2013 Loreben Tuquero/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
