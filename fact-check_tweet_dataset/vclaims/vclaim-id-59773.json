However, the box is referring to the wearer of the mask when it says it offers no protection against Covid-19.\n\nSurgical masks like the one in the image may have some (limited) protective effect for the wearer but they are more useful in preventing the spread of Covid-19 from the wearer to other people.\n\nConcrete evidence on this is limited, but there is some evidence that in healthcare settings wearing a mask like this can help protect you. Outside of hospitals, the science is limited and doesn\u2019t give a clear picture, but suggests that masks don't significantly reduce your own chance of catching the virus. Social distancing and regularly washing your hands is the best way to protect yourself.\n\nThe evidence does suggest that a mask is likely to benefit other people if you wear one. You should still wear a mask or face covering because even if you don\u2019t have symptoms, as you could have Covid-19 and be infectious. Some people may be infected but not be showing symptoms yet, and there is some evidence that this may be when people are most infectious. So even if you feel fine, you may be able to spread the virus. As it\u2019s spread by respiratory droplets and close contact between people, in places where social distancing is difficult such as shops, masks may slow the spread.\n\nMasks for hospital staff and in schools\n\nThe post claims that the masks pictured are given to \u201chospital staff and schools\u201d. From 15 June, NHS hospital staff in England have been required to wear type one or type two surgical masks. These are like the masks in the Facebook post, and only offer limited protection for the wearer from Covid-19, but can stop them spreading it. Depending on what the staff are doing, they may be required to wear respirators, such as an FFP2, that can protect the wearer from Covid-19.\n\nThe government says that \u201cwearing a face covering or face mask in schools or other education settings is not recommended\u201d and that schools and other childcare or education settings should not require staff, children and learners to wear face coverings. There are only some circumstances where masks and other PPE is needed, for example if a child becomes unwell with Covid-19 symptoms in one of these settings and needs to be looked after by an adult and a two metre distance cannot be maintained.\n\nFace coverings became mandatory in shops in England from 24 July, and are also mandatory in Scotland. They\u2019re also mandatory on public transport across the UK, and in hospitals in England and Scotland.", "lang": "en"}
