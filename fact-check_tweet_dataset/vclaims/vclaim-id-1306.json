This is a rise on the estimate of 747,000 for the same time last year.\n\nWe don\u2019t know how much of the rise over time is genuine. Increases in the numbers are likely to include at least some people who were already on the contracts but only recently became aware of this, possibly due to increased media coverage of the issue.\n\nThe only reliable data that we can use to compare over time, from surveys of businesses in 2014 and 2015, suggests there was little change in the number of contracts overall during that period.\n\nThere were 1.7 million people in temporary jobs in May to July 2016\u2014about 6.2% of all those in work. This is about the same level it was early 2010, though it did rise to 6.6% in 2012. The highest level ever recorded was almost 8% in 1997.\n\nIn terms of whether people in these jobs would rather be working more hours, 31% of people on zero hours contracts say they want more hours, mostly in their current job. 32% of the 1.7 million people in temporary jobs say they are doing so because they can\u2019t find a permanent job.", "lang": "en"}
