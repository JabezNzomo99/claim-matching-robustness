Kirsten Gillibrand no longer supports a bill she originally co-sponsored that would punish people for boycotting Israel.\n\n\"I am going to urge the authors of the bill to change the bill, and I will not support it in its current form,\" Gillibrand said at a town hall meeting in Queens.\n\nThe bill targets individuals and companies who participate in the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions movement, a Palestinian-led effort to remove international support for Israel by asking global leaders and businesses to cut ties with the country. Offenders could face heavy fines and even jail time under the bill.\n\nThe American Israel Public Affairs Committee sent an email to its supporters about Gillibrand\u2019s flip a few days after the event.\n\n\"New York\u2019s junior Senator, Kirsten Gillibrand, has withdrawn her co-sponsorship of the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S.720), sending a powerful message to her constituents that she no longer supports the fight to combat the international delegitimization of Israel,\" the email said.\n\nAIPAC is one of the most influential lobbying groups for pro-Israel interests in the U.S. Each major party candidate for president spoke at its conference last year.\n\nGillibrand has taken a lot of flack since the email blast, including from Jewish leaders and online publications. A letter to the editor published in the New York Daily News claims Gillibrand now supports the BDS movement. Pro-Palestinian groups have even thanked Gillibrand for opposing the bill.\n\nDoes her new stance on the bill mean she supports the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions movement?\n\nGillibrand said she changed her position after meeting with the American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes the bill.\n\n\"We went through their reading of the bill and why they believe it says \u2014 it chills free speech, which means the bill is ambiguous,\" Gillibrand said at the town hall.\n\nThe bill would fine individuals or companies anywhere from $250,000 to $1 million for engaging in any activity that supports the BDS movement, according to the ACLU. Violators could also face up to 20 years in prison.\n\nGillibrand changed her position because, in her view, individuals should not face that kind of punishment for expressing their opinion.\n\n\"I\u2019m against BDS but I think anybody who\u2019s in favor should feel very comfortable speaking on any stage, anywhere in America, saying exactly why,\" Gillibrand said. \"That is what free speech is about, and I fully support it.\"\n\nGillibrand said she does support penalizing companies that participate in BDS.\n\nGillibrand responded to her critics more than a week later in an opinion piece on Forward, a Jewish news website.\n\n\"Some have suggested that I suddenly began supporting the BDS movement when I took my name off the bill. This accusation has popped up on the Internet in recent days \u2013 both from Israel\u2019s supporters and from Israel\u2019s detractors. This is just plain false,\" Gillibrand wrote. \"I cannot state this more clearly: I vehemently oppose the BDS movement.\"\n\nAIPAC told its supporters Gillibrand \"no longer supports the fight to combat the international delegitimization of Israel.\"\n\nAIPAC did not respond to a request to clarify its statement.\n\nGillibrand has made it clear, both during the town hall and after, that she still opposes the BDS movement. She does not support the Israel Anti-Boycott Act in its current form because she believes it violates individual liberties.\n\nThe claim misleads readers who may now believe Gillibrand supports the BDS movement. We rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
