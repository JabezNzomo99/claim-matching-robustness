Cruz makes his claim about the polls at the 24 minute mark in the above YouTube video.\n\nHere\u2019s the Mostly False claim PolitiFact examined, based on comments Cruz made on April 7.\n\n\"My focus is on beating Hillary Clinton, and poll after poll after poll shows Donald losing badly to Hillary. And poll after poll after poll shows me beating Hillary.\"\n\nThe claims are substantially the same. When rating the statement Cruz made in Irvine, PolitiFact California will apply the same research used by national fact-checking website PolitiFact when it examined Cruz\u2019 claim on CNN.\n\nWhy PolitiFact rated this claim Mostly False\n\nPolitiFact found Cruz was right about polls showing GOP frontrunner Donald Trump losing to Clinton in a November matchup. It rated that statement True earlier this week.\n\nBut PolitiFact found Cruz wasn\u2019t accurate when portraying his own standing against Clinton in the surveys.\n\nPolitiFact examined recent national polls archived on and found that the Texas senator is off.\n\nIt found: \"Of the nine surveys released in the last month, Cruz beats Clinton in only one \u2014 a Fox News poll where Cruz scores 3 percentage points higher than Clinton. The two were tied in the latest McClatchy/Marist poll and in a CNN/ORC poll. The margins of error were +/- 3 percentage points.\n\nIn the other six polls, Clinton beat Cruz. In four of those surveys, Clinton's advantage exceeded the margin of error.\n\nCruz was looking stronger against Clinton in February, where he tied or beat Clinton in five of six surveys. But in only one of those polls was Cruz's edge greater than the margin of error.\n\nIf you use the most recent results from the various polling organizations since Feb. 4, Cruz wins in two, ties in two and loses in seven.\"\n\nPolitiFact contacted Cruz' spokeswoman last week to ask about the results but didn't hear back.\n\nIt concluded: \"So when Cruz says he beats Clinton in poll after poll after poll, he's short a poll or two.\"\n\nPolitiFact rated Cruz\u2019 claim on CNN as Mostly False. That rating means it has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\n\nLikewise, PolitiFact California rates Cruz\u2019 claim at the Irvine rally as Mostly False.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
