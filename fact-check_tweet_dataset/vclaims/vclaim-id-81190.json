Some countries have made provisions for arrests, while others have imposed hefty fines to help contain the spread of misinformation.\n\nHowever, human right activists and researchers argue that these measures stifle freedom of expression and might not help in solving the problem of dis/misinformation. Rather, they believe that the government should create an inducive environment, which can help create awareness about fake news.\n\nVarious research papers published in reputed journals have showed how misinformation related to COVID-19 has had serious health implications. One such study, published in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, shows that at least 800 people died globally due to COVID-related misinformation.\n\nAnother study shows an exponential increase in fact-checks around the coronavirus.", "lang": "en"}
