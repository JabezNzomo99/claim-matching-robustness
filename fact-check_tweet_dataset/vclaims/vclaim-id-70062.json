As snoring can be heard in the background, the anchor attempts to get the attention of her guest before giving up.\n\nIn recent days, the video has been widely shared on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. For instance, Dan Scavino, the White House director of social media, posted the video on Twitter, where it has garnered over 2 million views despite being labeled \u201cmanipulated media.\u201d (RELATED: Video Claims To Show Joe Biden Making A Racist Remark)\n\nThe altered video deceptively combines two separate clips. The portion with the local news anchor comes from a 2011 clip published by CBS affiliate KBAK-TV, while the other featuring Biden comes from a town hall Biden did with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton this April.\n\nIn the 2011 clip, the KBAK-TV anchor attempted to interview Belafonte. Ken Sunshine, Belafonte\u2019s spokesperson at the time, said that the singer\u2019s earpiece wasn\u2019t working due to a technical glitch and that he was taking a moment to meditate, CBS News reported.\n\nThe video of Biden comes from an April town hall event. In the original town hall clip, the Democratic presidential nominee appears to look down for roughly 15 seconds before lifting his gaze. Clinton was discussing COVID-19\u2019s impact on women at the time.\n\nNo snoring can be heard in either of the clips. It appears to have been added to the altered video, along with a chyron that reads, \u201cOn Air: Joe Biden | The Importance Of This Election.\u201d (RELATED: Viral Video Claims To Show Joe Biden Endorsing Donald Trump)\n\nJohn Dabkovich, a current anchor for CBS Sacramento, called out the version that Scavino tweeted as \u201cfake\u201d on Twitter. He co-anchored the program at the time of Belafonte\u2019s interview.\n\n\u201cThis is fake,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cYou know how I know? I was the coanchor in studio. We were interviewing Harry Belafonte.\u201d\n\nThe Biden campaign did not respond to a request for comment.", "lang": "en"}
