But Republicans have an advantage because they have an edge in small, rural states, which in the electoral college system require fewer votes per elector. In Wyoming, for instance, there are 143,000 people for each electoral vote, compared to 500,000 in a state such as California. Since Democrats tend to be concentrated in large cities, the impact of those votes is dissipated. This is one reason that in two recent elections \u2014 2000 and 2016 \u2014 the Democrat won the popular vote but lost the electoral college to the Republican.\n\nTrump\u2019s attack on NAFTA is over the top. It is often difficult to separate out the impact of trade agreements on jobs, compared to other, broader economic trends. But the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service in 2015 concluded that the \u201cnet overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP,\u201d though it noted \u201cthere were worker and firm adjustment costs as the three countries adjusted to more open trade and investment among their economies.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
