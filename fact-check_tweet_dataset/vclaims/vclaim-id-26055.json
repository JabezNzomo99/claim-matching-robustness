Several members received state awards in Russia,\u201d said Kiska in a statement. \u201cThe founder of the Night Wolves is on the sanction list for participation in the annexation of the Crimea and must not travel to any of the EU member states. So to be clear, they are no harmless motorcycle lovers.\u201d\n\nThe President \u201curged\u201d the Slovak government to provide security forces \u201cwith all the necessary conditions for effective action against the dubious societies that are spreading throughout our country.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Alexander Zaldostanov, aka \u201cthe Surgeon\u201d \u2013 the leader of the Night Wolves \u2013 unfolded an end of the world conspiracy theory in response to Kiska, accusing the Slovak President of using \u201cdemocracy and Soros\u201d to \u201cshape the world mentality\u201d for \u201cultimate control over the world.\u201d Soros is a frequent target of Russian nationalists and their Web sites.\n\n\u201cBut we are not a flock, following Soros to the abyss. We do not want to fit into their end of the world,\u201d said Surgeon, claiming his European base was not the \u201cinitiative of Moscow.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Surgeon\u2019s\u201d claim is false. For the the sorts of \u201cinitiatives\u201d that alerted the Slovakian president to the biker club, the \u201cNight Wolves\u201d has enjoyed privileged treatment by the Russian government -- funding verified in tens of millions of rubles and possibly much more in direct financing and presidential grants.\n\nIn the Russian government entrepreneur\u2019s registry, Alexander Zaldostanov is listed as the owner or manager of more than 11 currently active firms in Russia and a founder or a co-founder of about 60.\n\nAccording to Russian government open sources, groups and companies owned in full or in part by Alexander Zaldostanov, including the Night Wolves have received from the federal and regional government budgets in Russia approximately 60 million rubles between 2011 and 2018.\n\nExact sums are difficult to track due to the lack of transparency in Russia, especially in Chechnya and other rural regions, where the Night Wolves\u2019 leader enjoys the same privileged treatment as in Moscow.\n\nThe projects, for which the Surgeon is getting financial support from the Russian government, include, for instance, delivery of the gift of a giant bell from the Russian Orthodox Church to the Ukrainian city of Sevastopol in 2013 \u2013 one year before Putin was to move to annex the city along with the entire Crimean peninsula. The symbolism of the bell was apparent only to those familiar with a long time struggle of the Russian Orthodox Church in trying to take the independent Kyiv Church under its control.\n\nA year later, the Night Wolves took part in the annexation of Crimea, and in the war in eastern Ukraine, fighting as mercenaries against Kyiv.\n\nThere were also notorious motorcycle rallies through major EU cities from Russia to Berlin \u201cpromoting Russian patriotism and highlighting the glory of the Russian military\u201d \u2013 supposedly to celebrate and honor the \u201cliberating role of the Soviet Army\u201d in Europe at the end of World War II.\n\nIn Synchrony with the Kremlin\n\nThe statements and the actions of the Night Wolves often appear to be synchronized with Kremlin and Russian Defense Ministry narratives. For instance, the Wolves\u2019 establishment of a network of new \u201cheadquarters\u201d in the Balkans coincides with the plans of the Russian defense ministry to establish new military bases in Serbia and Bosnia, and the use of the existing \u201ccivilian bases\" for spying.\n\nThe Night Wolves base in Slovakia that triggered concern over national security, in fact, is not a mere \u201cheadquarters\u201d as \u201cthe Surgeon\u201d claims it is. Drone footage shows it to resemble a military fortress equipped with artillery, heavy armored vehicles and even tanks.\n\nThe base is located near where the borders of three European countries come together \u2013 the Czech Republic, Austria and Slovakia -- in a small town called Dolna Krupa. EU borders are open and so movement in the region is unrestricted.\n\nAccording to the newspaper Hospodarske Noviny, the local branch of the Night Wolves is headed by Jozef Hambalek, who the newspaper says owns the property and is close to former Slovak Interior Minister Robert Kalinak. Neither has commented publicly on the base, Radio Free Europe reported in July.\n\nThis July, a group of more than two hundred Slovak intellectuals sent an open letter to their government urging it take action against the Night Wolves. The letter called Hambalek a \u201cSlovak paramilitary fanatic\u201d and \u201can umbrella\u201d for Russia\u2019s covert operations.\n\nJozef Hambalek is the official founder and owner of the Slovak Night Wolves Club.\n\nIn 2016, the Montenegrin prosecutor indicted the leader of the Serbian Night Wolves club, and a veteran of Russia\u2019s war in eastern Ukraine, Aleksandr Sindjelic. He is accused of an attempted coup, including the assassination of Montenegro\u2019s then-Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, who Moscow perceived as rival due to his pro-Western views.\n\n\u201cIn the months leading up to the parliamentary elections of October 16, 2016, Russian agents, Serbian extremists, and leaders of the Montenegrin opposition alliance (the Democratic Front) prepared to oust the government violently on election night,\u201d said the report by the Foreign Policy Research Institute, based on testimony and physical evidence reviewed by researchers.", "lang": "en"}
