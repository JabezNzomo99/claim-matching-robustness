(We checked a few of those claims.)\n\nBut Democrats also made some clear call-outs to Trump-weary Republicans. Colin Powell, secretary of state under President George W. Bush, made an unannounced address in which he called Biden \"a president we will all be proud to salute.\" Another video detailed Biden\u2019s \"friendship that shouldn\u2019t have worked\" with the late Republican Sen. John McCain.\n\nJill Biden ended the night drawing a parallel between the Biden family\u2019s healing in the wake of tragedy and the country\u2019s need for \"honest leadership to bring us back together.\"\n\nHere\u2019s our rundown of fact-checked statements from night two of the DNC.\n\nICYMI: Fact-checking night one of the DNC\n\n\"Donald Trump says we\u2019re leading the world. Well, we are the only major industrial economy to have its unemployment rate triple.\" \u2014 Former President Bill Clinton\n\nMostly True. Using the most clear-cut multi-nation comparison from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Clinton is right.\n\nWe compared January to June, because only two of the 20 countries in this analysis reported data for July. Over those six months, the United States saw its unemployment rate increase from 3.6% to 11.1%. That works out to a little under 3.1 times higher in June than January.\n\nNo other country saw such a big increase. Only Canada came close, with the unemployment rate 2.2 times higher over that period. It started with a higher unemployment rate than the U.S.\n\nClinton\u2019s statement does not quite hold for the most recent U.S. unemployment rate. Extending the U.S. data to July showed that the increase fell slightly below three times.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton speaks during the second night of the Democratic National Convention. (DNC via AP)\n\n\"We have just 4% of the world\u2019s population \u2014 25% of the world\u2019s cases.\" \u2014 Former President Bill Clinton\n\nThis statistic is correct. The Johns Hopkins database of COVID-19 cases shows about 22 million global cases as of Aug. 18, including almost 5.5 million cases in the U.S. That works out to about 25% of the world\u2019s cases. The U.S. represents about 4% of the world\u2019s population.\n\nAs we explained in a fact-check of President Donald Trump\u2019s false statement that \"our numbers are better than almost all countries,\" there are other ways to compare cases globally. Those measures include case fatality rate, death rate per 100,000, per-capita cases and the positivity rate.\n\nMeasured against the size of the population, the United States has the 10th-highest death rate in the world. It\u2019s doing better than the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Sweden and Chile, but worse than France, Canada and Germany, to pick a few examples.\n\nFactoring in population size, the United States has one of the highest rates globally of people who have tested positive \u2014 16,430 per million residents, which is lower than Chile, but higher than any other large country.\n\nWith a positivity rate of about 7%, the United States ranks in the middle of the pack, doing better than countries such as Mexico and Argentina, but worse than just about every country in Europe, as well as Canada and Australia.\n\nFormer Acting Attorney General Sally Yates speaks during the second night of the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday, Aug. 18, 2020. (DNC via AP)\n\nSays Trump\u2019s January 2017 travel ban was \"unlawful.\" \u2014 Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates\n\nThis statement by Yates, who was fired for refusing to defend Trump\u2019s first order, needs more context. Lower courts blocked Trump\u2019s three different versions of a travel ban. Then in 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the third version to stand.\n\nThe court said Trump had \"lawfully exercised the broad discretion\" granted to him under federal law to suspend the entry of people from several Muslim-majority nations into the United States. The Trump administration said Trump\u2019s proclamation was issued on national security grounds.\n\nThe Supreme Court said in a 5-4 decision that the president need only determine that the entry of certain individuals would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and Trump fulfilled that requirement. Critics of the travel ban labeled it as a Muslim ban.\n\nWhile the court found that Trump's proclamation squared with his presidential authority under immigration law, the decision was limited to the facts of that case and did not have broad impacts on immigration law, experts have told us.\n\nTrump\u2019s travel ban still faces other lawsuits challenging its constitutionality, including one brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and other organizations, arguing that Trump violated federal laws and the Constitution\u2019s First and Fifth amendments.\n\nFormer Secretary of State John Kerryspeaks during the second night of the Democratic National Convention. (DNC via AP)\n\nSays President Donald Trump \"does nothing about Russia putting a bounty on our troops.\" \u2014 Former Secretary of State John Kerry\n\nTrump has not publicly condemned or warned Russia over reports that it offered Taliban-linked militants bounties to kill American troops in Afghanistan. He said he doesn\u2019t believe the intelligence.\n\nTrump dismissed New York Times reporting about the bounties as \"just another hoax.\" Trump also has said he wasn\u2019t briefed about the issue, although multiple news reports said warnings about the bounties were included in the President\u2019s Daily Brief.\n\nThe matter \"never reached my desk. You know why? Because they didn't think\u2014 intelligence, they didn't think it was real. \u2026 If it reached my desk, I would have done something about it,\" Trump told Axios\u2019 Jonathan Swan in an interview aired on HBO Aug. 3.\n\nTrump in the interview said he didn\u2019t bring it up either in a July phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"Now, it's unthinkable that Donald Trump is trying to take that health care away. In the middle of a pandemic, he is still trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.\" \u2014 Narrator of a health care video segment\n\nWe checked a similar statement by former President Barack Obama and found it True.\n\nThe attack line refers to Texas v. Azar, a court case pending before the Supreme Court in which the Trump Administration has joined with a group of Republican governors in an effort to overturn the Affordable Care Act, or ACA. The ACA is Obama\u2019s signature health care law that expanded access to health insurance to millions of Americans and went into effect in 2010.\n\nIt is estimated that 27 million Americans could become uninsured during the COVID-19 pandemic due to job losses and other factors. But the Trump administration has continued its legal challenge.\n\nWhen Biden was talking to Laura Packard, who had stage IV Hodgkins Lymphoma, she said, \"Ever since I was diagnosed, every night I would go to bed concerned about what news I would get in the morning. And even still, even today, they're still trying to take away our health care, even during a pandemic.\"\n\nAnother woman later said in a video segment focused on health care that, \"I chose to become a Joe Biden delegate as I watched with our nation as President Donald Trump sought to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nFor Trump\u2019s part, he ran for president in 2016 on the promise that he would repeal and replace the ACA. He supported a 2017 congressional effort that narrowly failed to pass repealing the bill. And since then Trump has continuously promised to produce a Republican health care bill, which would replace the ACA and protect people with preexisting conditions. He has so far failed to deliver.", "lang": "en"}
