To refresh the American offer, which has been on the table for more than two years, senior officials from the White House, the Pentagon, the State Department and other agencies decided within the past month to allow the simultaneous release of all five men. Taliban representatives had objected to the previous plan to release the prisoners by ones or twos as a test of Taliban and Qatari intermediaries\u2019 ability to make sure the men did not return to militancy.\n\nCOOPER: New efforts being made tonight to bring home the only American soldier in captivity. Bowe Bergdahl is his name. The Army sergeant was seized in Afghanistan back in 2009. He\u2019s been held this long. He\u2019s believed to be held by the Taliban-aligned Haqqani network inside Pakistan. Over the years, several proof-of-life videos of Bergdahl have been released. CNN is unable to independently confirm their authenticity. But just weeks ago the U.S. military obtained a new video that\u2019s never been publicly released. It\u2019s raised concerns, though, about Bergdahl\u2019s health. The Taliban has long demanded the release of five Taliban prisoners from Guantanamo in exchange for his release. Well, today a U.S. official confirmed that new discussions led by diplomats and the Pentagon are underway. As you know the United States has long policy saying they don\u2019t negotiate with terrorists. That\u2019s the official policy. But time may be running out. With U.S. troops set to leave Afghanistan by the end of the year, there\u2019s the prospect of leaving a man behind. Senator John McCain, a former Vietnam prisoner of war, of course, has been a vocal opponent of negotiating with the Taliban in years past. Tonight only on 360 he has a new position. I spoke to him earlier. COOPER: Would you oppose the idea of some form of negotiations or prisoner exchange? I know back in 2012 you called the idea of even negotiating with the Taliban bizarre, highly questionable. McCAIN: Well, at that time the proposal was that they would release Taliban, some of them really hard-core, particularly five really hard-core Taliban leaders, as a confidence-building measure. Now this idea is for an exchange of prisoners for our American fighting man. I would be inclined to support such a thing depending on a lot of the details. COOPER: Of anybody on Capitol Hill, you know better than anybody what this young man must be going through. Obviously it\u2019s a very different time. How do you get through something like this? I mean, for somebody in this situation? McCAIN: Well, I was fortunate in where he is not that I had fellow POWs that even though I was a long time in solitary confinement we would tap on the wall to each other and stay in communication. If it wasn\u2019t for that, it would have been a very different story for most of us. And this is why I feel especially sympathetic for Mr. Bergdahl because he is all there by himself. COOPER: So if there was the possibility of some sort of exchange, that\u2019s something you would support? McCAIN: I would support \u2014 obviously I\u2019d have to know the details \u2014 but I would support ways of bringing him home, and if exchange was one of them I think that would be something I think we should seriously consider.", "lang": "en"}
