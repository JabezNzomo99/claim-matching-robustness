This is false; photographs clearly show space between mourners, and a spokesperson for the church said it reached only a fraction of capacity as people stayed six feet apart, except for members of Lewis\u2019s grieving family.\n\n\u201cHow come famous people like Congressman John Lewis and \u2018Saint\u2019 George Floyd are allowed to have funerals that violate social distancing policies, but regular folks can't?\u201d said a July 31, 2020 Facebook post on the page of Mark Dice, who describes himself as a media analyst and author who exposes \u201cthe liberal lunatics and their manipulation of mainstream media.\u201d\n\nThe post was accompanied by a photograph from the July 30 funeral of the Democratic congressman showing a middle section of the church where people did sit close together.\n\nOther Facebook posts claimed the church was \u201cfull of people\u201d and \u201cthousands\u201d were allowed inside.\n\nBut it is false to claim that social distancing was not followed, or that the service at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia was packed.\n\nA church spokesperson told AFP by phone that those in the middle were Lewis\u2019s relatives.\n\n\u201cAs you can imagine, a family that is grieving and trying to console each other, they chose, because they're related and they're family, they chose to sit a little closer together,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIn all other areas of the church they were socially distanced,\u201d following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, she added.\n\n\u201cThe floors were marked. The seats were marked. They came in six feet apart. They walked six feet apart. Everything was six feet apart. Temperatures were taken. Nurses were there,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nEbenezer Baptist has a capacity of 2,000, but \u201cless than 10 percent of the seating capacity of the church\u201d was occupied, she said, adding: \u201cYou can't say \u2018full\u2019, you can't say \u2018thousands\u2019\u201d were there.\n\nThe church\u2019s senior pastor, Raphael Warnock, referred to social distancing at the 39:32 mark of the livestreamed service when he spoke of \u201cthese difficult days that have even made grieving more challenging. At a time when we would find comfort in embracing one another, love compels us to socially distance.\u201d\n\nAhead of the funeral, the Lewis family said that because of \u201cprecautions necessary during the pandemic, the church will only accommodate 240 people in total, due to social distancing precautions.\u201d Half of those seats were allocated for his family and relatives, they said in a statement carried on the Facebook page of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity\u2019s Nu Alpha Sigma Chapter.\n\nLewis was a brother in the fraternity.\n\nPhotographs taken by a pool photographer clearly show empty space between those in the pews. Mourners are also wearing face masks, which are another CDC recommendation for protecting against viral spread during the pandemic.\n\nGeorgia is one of the US states worst-affected by cases of the coronavirus. In April it controversially became the first large state to reopen its economy after a coronavirus lockdown, even as it grappled with substantial numbers of coronavirus cases and a rising number of infections and deaths.\n\nRepublican Governor Brian Kemp has since banned gatherings of more than 50 people unless there are six feet between them.\n\nFormer presidents Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama all paid homage to Lewis during the service, as did House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She attended with a delegation of about 50 other members of Congress, among them Republican Representatives Barry Loudermilk of Georgia and Kevin Brady of Texas.\n\nLewis\u2019s body had earlier lain in state at the US Capitol, a rarely-bestowed honor. Lewis was a proponent of non-violence whose skull was fractured by a state trooper during a 1965 march for voting rights that he helped lead in the struggle for racial equality.\n\nHe represented a Georgia district in the House of Representatives for 33 years until his death from cancer on July 17.\n\nThe funeral took place in a new church building across from the historic site where Martin Luther King, Jr served as co-pastor until his assassination in 1968.\n\nAFP previously debunked misleading claims that the mayor of Washington, DC granted members of congress who attended Lewis\u2019s funeral a special exemption from COVID-19 quarantine rules.", "lang": "en"}
