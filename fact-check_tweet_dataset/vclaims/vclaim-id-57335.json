This particular Facebook post claims Harris \u201cwants to eliminate\u201d beef. (RELATED: Was Kamala Harris The Alameda County District Attorney When Oscar Grant Was Killed?)\n\n\u201cKamala Harris wants to eliminate this right here,\u201d the post, which is accompanied by a photo of cooked beef, reads. \u201cIf you raise beef or eat beef, you can\u2019t vote the democratic party this election. She has worked with Cory Booker on eliminating animal agriculture and is on record starting that meat is killing the planet. That shows her ignorance.\u201d\n\nWhile Harris did state that she supports changing dietary guidelines to reduce the consumption of red meat during a CNN climate change town hall last year, she does not appear to have called for banning it altogether. During the town hall, she suggested that Americans need to be \u201ceducated about the effect of our eating habits on our environment,\u201d but also stated, \u201cI love cheeseburgers from time to time.\u201d\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency states that the agricultural sector contributed about 10 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2018. Cattle and other livestock produce methane during their digestive processes, and those emissions account for over a quarter those produced by the agricultural sector, according to the agency. The management of livestock manure can also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nHarris has previously worked with Democratic New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker on agricultural issues. Last month, Booker introduced a bill, which Harris co-sponsors, that seeks to temporarily suspend current and future USDA waivers allowing meatpacking plants to increase production line speed during the pandemic. However, it doesn\u2019t eliminate production at such facilities altogether.\n\nBooker last year introduced the Farm System Reform Act, a bill that, among other things, proposes the phasing out of industrial-scale livestock farms by 2040, according to Politico. Harris is not listed as a co-sponsor of the bill.\n\nHarris\u2019 office did not return a request for comment.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
