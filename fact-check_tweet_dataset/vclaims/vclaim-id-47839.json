It is being claimed that a member of the Muslim community had thrown Rs 100, Rs 200 and Rs 500 notes to spread coronavirus.\n\nTwitter handle @SortedEagle posted this video with the message, \u201cThey\u2019ve found a new way to spread the virus now. A resident of this area in Indore saw a Muslim chap scatter currency notes of 100, 200 & 500 in the locality for people to pick up & get infected. Police was called & they collected them with protection. 10 grand scattered around.\u201d It has been retweeted more than 1,200 times so far.\n\nThis video has also been shared on Facebook with a similar narrative. It is also getting shared with a message in Tamil. The message claims that Muslims in West Bengal are throwing notes on road to spread the virus.\n\nThe video has been shared with a message in Hindi as well. However, the Hindi text doesn\u2019t give any communal angle to the incident. Alt News has received several requests on its Android application to fact-check this video.\n\nWith a Google search, Alt News found a report published by Dainik Jagran on April 17, 2020. According to the report, the incident took place at Indore\u2019s Khatipura-Gori Nagar road on Thursday. People informed the police after seeing some notes scattered on the road after which they sanitised the notes and ceased them. Furthermore, the police went through the footage of near-by CCTV camera but they couldn\u2019t find a suspected vehicle or a person. The report nowhere identified the person suspected of having thrown the notes as a Muslim.\n\nWe then reached out to Hira Nagar police station regarding this matter. In conversation with Alt News, station in-charge Rajiv Bhaduria said, \u201cIt is clear that any person or a Muslim didn\u2019t deliberate scatter the notes. Actually, the notes fell from the pocket of an Indane gas delivery guy. The person\u2019s name is Narendra Yadav and he is a resident of Indore\u2019s Gauri Nagar. Yadav had come to us to know about the notes. After listening to his story, we checked the CCTV footage and it became clear that these were his notes.\u201d\n\nThus, it is certain that these notes in Khatipura area of Indore were not deliberately thrown on the roadside by a member of the Muslim community to spread the coronavirus. A similar incident took place in Delhi with a man who had borrowed money from an ATM. A video of that incident was also shared with an anti-Muslim angle on social media.\n\nNote: The number of positive cases of the novel coronavirus in India exceeds 17,000 and over to 500 deaths have so far been reported. The government has imposed a complete restriction on movement apart from essential services to tackle the pandemic. Globally, more than 24 lakh confirmed cases and close to 1.6 lakh deaths have been reported. There is a sense of panic among citizens, causing them to fall for a variety of online misinformation \u2013 misleading images and videos rousing fear or medical misinformation promoting pseudoscience and invalid treatments.
