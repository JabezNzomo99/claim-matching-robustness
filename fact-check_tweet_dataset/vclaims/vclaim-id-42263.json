Donald Trump has said he thinks so.\n\n\"If I had not been elected president of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed,\" Trump said during his State of the Union address.\n\nHe repeated the claim recently when announcing an emergency declaration on the U.S.-Mexico border wall, saying that Obama was particularly out to get North Korea.\n\n\"I said, \u2018What\u2019s the biggest problem?\u2019 (Obama) said, \u2018By far, North Korea.\u2019 And I don\u2019t want to speak for him, but I believe he would have gone to war with North Korea. I think he was ready to go to war,\" Trump said. \"In fact, he told me he was so close to starting a big war with North Korea.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s comments are hypothetical, so we won\u2019t put his remarks to the Truth-O-Meter. (We reached out to both the White House and Obama\u2019s post-presidential office for their take on the conversation, but we didn\u2019t hear back.)\n\nBut the claim struck us as strange. We could recall no serious discussion of imminent war with North Korea during the Obama administration.\n\nWe asked a range of North Korea and foreign-policy experts whether they thought it was likely, or even plausible, that the United States was on the precipice of war with North Korea during Obama\u2019s tenure.\n\nUniversally, the experts we contacted said no.\n\n\"There was no crisis brewing or heightened tension at the end of the Obama presidency,\" said Robert S. Ross, an Asia specialist with appointments at Boston College and Harvard University.\n\n\"Absolutely not,\" agreed Evans J.R. Revere, a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institution and a senior director with the Albright Stonebridge Group.\n\n\"No. Point blank, no,\" said Joseph DeThomas, a professor at the Penn State School of International Affairs and a former foreign service officer who worked on North Korea issues.\n\nFormer Obama officials, including former CIA director John Brennan, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes, and former White House communications director Jen Psaki have rejected the notion that the two countries were on imminent war footing.\n\nExperts told PolitiFact that they believe one part of Trump\u2019s claim, that Obama told Trump that North Korea was the thorniest foreign-policy challenge facing the United States. That\u2019s a widely held view in foreign policy circles. But that\u2019s the extent of their agreement with what Trump said.\n\nThe overall policy toward North Korea during Obama\u2019s tenure was \"strategic patience\" \u2014 the notion that \"if we ignore them, they will go away and eventually implode,\" said John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org.\n\nThere\u2019s room for disagreement about how effective \"strategic patience\" was. As we now know, North Korea and its leader Kim Jong Un used the pause to further refine the country\u2019s weapons and missile systems.\n\nStill, the strategic patience policy wasn\u2019t compatible with imminent war, experts said.\n\nIt was \"not the same thing as preparing for war, or planning a war, or even intending to conduct a war,\" DeThomas said. \"Obama was doing none of those. He was upgrading military deployments in order to deter North Korea and to reassure allies.\"\n\nOn two occasions, the United States has been closer to war with North Korea than under Obama, DeThomas said.\n\n\"The worst time was just before the negotiation of the Agreed Framework in 1994, when the Clinton administration was contemplating a strike on North Korean nuclear facilities and was about to give the order to evacuate U.S. dependents from Korea in advance of that action,\" he said.\n\nThe second, DeThomas said, was in 2017, when Trump himself \"was pushing the Pentagon to evacuate dependents and threatening in front of the United Nations General Assembly to destroy North Korea.\"\n\nSpecifically, Trump threatened North Korea with \"fire and fury\" in August 2017 and then, a month later, said in a speech to the UN General Assembly that he would \"totally destroy North Korea\" if threatened. He also tweeted in January 2018 that \"I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!\"\n\nRevere of Brookings dismisses Trump\u2019s line about being close to war under Obama as a distraction.\n\n\"In pointing the finger of blame at Obama, Trump is seeking to distract us from the fact that he was playing both the arsonist and the fireman in stoking the flames of war and then riding to the \u2018rescue\u2019 in the form of his bromance with Kim,\" Revere said. \"It has made for great theater, even if it has done nothing to rid us of the North Korean nuclear and missile threat.\"", "lang": "en"}
