In the video, the policeman seeks help in locating the kid's family. It is being claimed that the baby was spotted in Nagpur railway station and can only speak Tamil.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the incident is from Pakistan and months old.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nFacebook user \"Srinivasa Pragasam\" posted the video with the caption, \"This baby in Nagpur station she can speak only Tamil. Just forward to best of your known people. It may reach an appropriate person.\"\n\nTill the filing of this story, this post was shared more than 5,700 times.\n\nTo verify the claim, we listened carefully to the viral video and found some important clues. First of all, the uniform of the cop resembles that of Pakistan police. One can see the similarities in the comparison below.\n\nAt 40 seconds into the video, the policeman appeals to collect the kid from \"Khawaja Ajmer Nagri\" police station. A Google search showed that the said police station is in Karachi, Pakistan. The policeman also confirms that the kid is so young that she can't speak or say her name.\n\nWe also found the same video on YouTube which was uploaded on December 4, 2018. This means that the video is quite old.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that the viral video is not from Nagpur but Pakistan.", "lang": "en"}
