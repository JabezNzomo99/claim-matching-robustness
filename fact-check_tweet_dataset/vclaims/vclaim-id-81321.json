Tom Cotton, Republican freshman senator from Arkansas. He has been making headlines thanks to his open letter to the leaders of the Iranian regime warning against negotiating a nuclear deal with President Obama that Congress would not approve \u2014 an action that earned him the label \u201ctraitor\u201d in a provocative Daily News front page image.\n\nGiven the whirlwind of media coverage Cotton has received lately, it is not surprising that a reader e-mailed us with the above image, found on Facebook. \u201cCan this be true?\u201d the reader asked. \u201cSenator Cotton does seem like a bit of a loose cannon but this quote seem so unlikely.\u201d\n\nA quick search on social media outlets showed this same meme circulating among several left-leaning groups and accounts on Facebook and Twitter. There are at least two versions of the same \u201cquote\u201d being circulated.\n\nThis meme seems to be inspired by his maiden speech this week, during which he spoke about defense spending. After all, the \u201csource\u201d of the \u201cquote\u201d is cited as his floor speech. We tried to track down where it originated, but the trail through the abyss of social media memes ran cold.\n\nCotton was critical of current defense spending levels. He began his speech on that point: \u201cThe world is growing ever more dangerous and our defense spending is wholly inadequate to confront the danger.\u201d He spoke on national security threats from Iran, North Korea and Russia. He described cuts made to each military branch, and urged Congress to restore the military budget to \u201creflect the threats we face\u201d rather than voting on a budget that would define those threats.\n\nThere is no reference to prisons, or any specific government assistance programs \u2014 including \u201cfood stamps\u201d \u2014 in his particular speech. But a popular news article that has been republished on left-leaning Web sites leading up to his speech were critical of his previous statements on food stamps (now formally known as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP) and for calling Guantanamo Bay \u201cone of our most effective counterterrorism tools.\u201d\n\nAs for Medicare spending, Cotton did call for reducing spending in retirement and health care programs, which he called \u201cthe genuine driver of our long-term debt crisis.\u201d Many budget experts have warned the the retirement of the Baby Boom generation will put budgetary pressure on Medicare and Social Security.\n\nCotton criticized the last major deficit-reduction deal, the Budget Control Act of 2011, for failing to confront the challenges faced by those programs and instead putting the burden of deficit reduction on annual discretionary spending, such as the defense budget. (Medicare and Social Security operate on automatic pilot, unless Congress takes the politically difficult step of altering benefits and fees.) Such a stance is catnip for liberal critics \u2014 witness this DailyKos article \u2014 but he certainly did not question the need for Medicare or suggest the program \u201cnurtures the most dangerous elements of our society.\u201d\n\nBe careful what you see online. It takes seconds to make a meme. The more bizarre the quote, the quicker it gets retweeted, reblogged or reposted. While it contains elements of Cotton\u2019s policy stances that his critics are not happy with, it is clear he never said this fake quote \u2014 certainly not in the particular speech cited in the image. The irresponsible image earns Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
