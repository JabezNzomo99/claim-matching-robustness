It also alleged that she used P1.7 million of illegal funds to finance her 2016 campaign.\n\nHontiveros was part of the PhilHealth board of directors from November 2014 to October 2015. She quit to file her certificate of candidacy for the senatorial elections in 2016.\n\nRappler, GMA News, and Inquirer.net all reported on August 3 that the COA affirmed its earlier decision to disallow the P163.86 million in bonuses that PhilHealth granted their employees in 2009, 2010, and 2014. (READ: COA to PhilHealth: Return P164-M illegal perks)\n\nThe COA said then that only the PhilHealth board and its certifying members will be held liable for the total P80.79 million in incentives, Christmas bonuses, and anniversary gifts that the board approved in 2011.\n\nPhilHealth\u2019s good faith defense in the case of the P83.062 million in education assistance and birthday cash gifts given in 2015 does not hold, according to the COA, because there are existing rules prohibiting those.\n\nThe COA reports did not name any PhilHealth board member as being responsible for the illegal benefits and allowances, or for previous orders to PhilHealth regarding the illegal perks.", "lang": "en"}
