Researchers and writers of the report confirmed that there is no way to use its findings to calculate such a percentage.\n\nHuman Rights Watch, an international non-governmental organization that tracks human rights abuses, released a Feb. 5 report, titled \u201cDeported to Danger: United States Deportation Policies Expose Salvadorans to Death and Abuse,\u201d that outlines some of the dangers faced by Salvadorans who are deported from the U.S. back to El Salvador, which has one of the highest homicide rates in the world.\n\nNumerous media outlets, including NBC News, The Associated Press and the Daily Beast, reported on Human Rights Watch\u2019s findings. (RELATED: Did Trump Terminate Temporary Protected Status For 98 Percent Of Its Recipients?)\n\n\u201cA huge percentage of migrants and asylum seekers from El Salvador who were deported by the United States have been killed, raped or tortured after returning home,\u201d wrote the Daily Beast, citing the Human Rights Watch study.\n\nBut that statement from the Daily Beast misrepresents what the study actually found. Human Rights Watch confirmed through court records, media reports and interviews with family members that 138 Salvadoran deportees had been murdered and more than 70 others had been sexually assaulted or tortured since 2013. A majority of the documented deaths occurred less than a year after the deportees were sent back to El Salvador, according to the report.\n\nThe U.S. deported 111,000 Salvadorans back to their home country between 2014 and 2018, Human Rights Watch reported. The number of Salvadorans seeking asylum increased by nearly 1,000 percent from 2012 to 2017, with many citing the gang violence prevalent in El Salvador, according to The Associated Press.\n\nWhile the report does underscore the risks faced by Salvadorans forced to return to their home country, it at no point attempts to calculate the percentage of all Salvadoran deportees harmed, as the Daily Beast appears to suggest.\n\nElizabeth Kennedy, the primary researcher of the Human Rights Watch report, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that such a percentage \u201ccannot be calculated\u201d from the report. (RELATED: Are There 2,000 MS-13 Gang Members On Long Island?)\n\n\u201cThe only way an accurate percentage could be calculated is for one of the two governments involved to either follow up with all persons returned or with a representative sample of all persons returned for at least several months,\u201d Kennedy explained in an email. \u201cNeither the U.S., El Salvador, nor any of the other 20+ nations who have deported Salvadorans have done this, as our report makes clear in several places.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did not purport to provide a percentage of deportees harmed,\u201d said Clara Long, a Human Rights Watch senior researcher who contributed to the writing and editing of the report, in a Twitter direct message to the DCNF.\n\nWe rate this claim from the Daily Beast false.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
