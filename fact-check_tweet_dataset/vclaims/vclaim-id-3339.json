(See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: When did the anti-drugs campaign under Duterte officially begin?)\n\n\u201cReal Numbers PH,\u201d the government\u2019s figures on the drug war released monthly by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA), has a much lower tally: 86, as of Nov. 27.\n\nThe total includes members of PDEA, the Philippine National Police, National Bureau of Investigation and Armed Forces of the Philippines killed \u201cin anti-drug operations.\u201d . (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Duterte says 2-3 cops killed daily in war on drugs)\n\nIt is unclear what Duterte meant by law enforcers killed \u201cin Mindanao.\u201d\n\nYet tally at the end of the Marawi crisis, 165 soldiers and cops killed, also does not support Duterte\u2019s claim:\n\nDuterte, in a speech Sept. 26, claimed the Marawi crisis broke out when security forces served a warrant of arrest on a local drug lord.\n\n\u201cReal Numbers PH\u201d shows no law enforcer was killed between Oct. 25 to Nov. 27, around the same period Duterte transferred to PDEA leadership in anti- drug operations.\n\n\n\nOn Dec. 5, he directed the PNP and other agencies to \u201cresume providing active support\u201d to PDEA.\n\nOfficial Gazette, Memorandum from the President, Oct. 10, 2017\n\nRTVM, Speech of President Rodrigo Duterte during the 56th Anniversary of the Philippine Constitution Association, Sept. 26, 2017\n\n(Guided by the code of principles of the International Fact-Checking Network at Poynter, VERA Files tracks the false claims, flip-flops, misleading statements of public officials and figures, and debunks them with factual evidence.
