With this directive what it means is that we are not supposed to follow up at the community level,\u201d Central regional secretary of the group Alfred Addy told GhanaFact.\n\nThe Ghana Medical Association (GMA) has also raised red flags about the new directive, warning that \u201chalting mass testing will not help in successfully containing the virus\u201d and \u201cpreventing significant community spread,\u201d the General Secretary of GMA, Dr Justice Yankson said in an interview.\n\nGhana\u2019s total confirmed coronavirus cases stand at 14,568 with 10,907 recoveries and 95 deaths as at June 24.\n\nThe Central region ranks fourth in terms of the number of confirmed cases recorded across the 16 regions of Ghana.", "lang": "en"}
