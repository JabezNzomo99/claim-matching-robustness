Babu was martyred during a face-off with Chinese soldiers in the Galwan valley near patrolling point 14, reported The Economic Times.\n\nAround June 16, a photograph of a child paying homage to Babu\u2019s portrait was widely circulated on social media including on Facebook and Twitter. As per the claims, the girl in the image is the daughter of Babu. Even mainstream media outlets like Deccan Chronicle (archive link) and Assam-based TV channel DY365 (archive link) made the same claim in their news reports.\n\nIPS Madhur Verma (archive link) and AS Sonal Goel (archive link) also made the same claim. Their tweets got over 1000 likes each. Navika Kumar, group editor of Times Group, tweeted the viral image without making an explicit claim. It was retweeted over 4,700 times (archive link).\n\n\n\nThe child in the viral image is a sister of an ABVP Karnataka member. On June 17, the Twitter handle of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) posted multiple tweets and clarified, \u201cWe understand their sentiments, but deem it necessary to clarify that the girl is younger sister of an @ABVPKarnataka karyakarta.\u201d\n\nTheir Facebook page also shared multiple pictures from the private homage ceremony along with the caption, \u201cKaryakarta of ABVP in Nelamangala Taluk of Karnataka, along with his little sister, paid homage to Col. Santhosh Babu who was martyred during the scuffle between India and China at LAC in Galwan Valley, Ladakh.\u201d\n\nThe Times of India had earlier fact-checked the image.\n\nThus the social media claim associated with the viral image is false. The girl is not late Col Santosh Babu\u2019s daughter.", "lang": "en"}
