No, that's not true: pranksters from online message board 4chan have started a campaign to spread that message but it is all a big joke aimed at undermining media credibility.\n\nIn a 4chan thread (archived here) an anonymous user by the handle \"Bash the Hash\" made following proposal on May 25, 2019:\n\nAlright faggots I'm reigniting this thread because I believe that this will be the greatest thing to ever happen to modern social media. We must start using # to represent the swastika on memes and social media. It will be a perfect win - win situation, either Twitter will have to accept blatant nazism on its forum's or it will effectively have to find a way to get rid of the sites core mechanics. Not only will this fuck twitter up but it will also force corporations to stop putting hashtags on every fucking ad ever. \n\nI'm cou ting on you /pol/ #honkhonkler# and #bashthehash#\n\nThis led to several memes and posts being spread online that claim the hashtag sign is a hidden hate symbol, here are some examples:\n\nOne reddit user by the handel u/ReynardBeauregard posted a thread (archived here) claiming CNN reported on it:\n\nBut the image used in the Reddit post was manipulated:\n\nIt was based on a real screenshot of a broadcast by CNN's S.E. Cupp to which a new caption and image were added:\n\nYou can watch the full broadcast here at Mediaite, the screenshot is from about 24 seconds into the video:", "lang": "en"}
