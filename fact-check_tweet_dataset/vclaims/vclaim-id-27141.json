{"title": "FALSE: Littering runners in photo are 'university students'", "subtitle": "This is an old photo of runners, called Eco Warriors, participating in the National Geographic Earth Day Run 2012", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "Feb 8, 2019 4:56 PM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-27141", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/false-littering-runners-in-photo-are-university-students", "vclaim": "On February 3, 2019, the Metro Manila News Facebook page posted a photo of supposed students running along a street littered with disposable paper cups and plastic bottles. One of the runners was shown tossing a paper cup into the pavement.\n\nThe caption on the photo initially described the runners as UP students who were LP supporters protesting in a rally. It then decried the lack of discipline on the part of the supposed rally-goers.\n\nThree days later, after several Facebook users called out the page in the comments section, it changed the caption of the photo to say those in the photo were students of different universities participating in a fun run.\n\nThe post of the claim was pinned on the page and has drawn at least 22,228 engagements since the day it was posted.\n\nIn his post, he said he was dismayed to see people littering the street with used paper cups and bottled water as these contradicted the purpose of the event.\n\nThis is not the first time that the Facebook page Metro Manila News has published hoax content. In September 2018, it was among the sites that posted false information about the late President Corazon Aquino and former Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno wearing a necklace that had supposedly gone missing from the collection of the Presidential Commission on Good Government. \u2013 Glenda Marie Castro/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
