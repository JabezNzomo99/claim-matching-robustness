It puts the UK\u2019s aid at just under $2 billion compared to Germany\u2019s $2.4 billion and the United States\u2019 $5.9 billion.\n\nBased on the average exchange rate for 2015/2016, the UK has contributed roughly \u00a31.3 billion. This tallies with what the Department for International Development says it has allocated as of August 2016.\n\nDfID told us that the UK is still the second largest bilateral donor of humanitarian aid, which is what the Prime Minister was talking about. It said that much of the aid Germany provides is for longer term development rather than basic necessities such as food, water and sanitation.\n\nIt may be that this is one of those situations where it all depends on exactly what you measure. We\u2019ll look into it further.", "lang": "en"}
