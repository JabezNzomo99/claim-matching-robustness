But is that already happening, or are prices still climbing? The two parties disagree, and it depends on how they\u2019re measuring drug prices.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has claimed, \u201cLast year, for the first time in over 50 years, drug prices went down,\u201d while Sen. Kamala Harris says on her website that pharmaceutical companies \u201cincreased drug prices by 10.5 percent over the past six months alone.\u201d\n\nThe president is referring to a measure of what consumers and insurers pay at retail pharmacies (though it hasn\u2019t been 50 years since that index dropped), and Harris is referring to list prices for a basket of drugs, according to their campaigns.\n\nThe problem with drug prices is that they can be measured in different ways, and there\u2019s not one comprehensive measure of all prices, or alternatively, of what people, insurers and the government ultimately pay. There are rebates and discounts and behind-the-scenes negotiations, as well as common retail drugs, specialty drugs and physician-administered medications. The introduction of generics and how prescribing patterns change also impact what is spent.\n\n\u201cThere is no measure that actually does what we\u2019re talking about,\u201d Joseph Antos, a health policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute, told us. There\u2019s \u201cno good measure of drug pricing trends.\u201d\n\nRichard Evans, founder and general manager of SSR Health, an investment research firm, told us the answer to whether prices have gone up or down depends on which drugs we\u2019re talking about and at which point in the supply chain. \u201cList prices are rising for brands, but the net prices are falling,\u201d he said, with \u201cnet\u201d meaning after rebates, discounts, coupons and fees are deducted.\n\nSSR Health\u2019s analysis captures 90% of brand sales and measures price-per-unit trends. In inflation-adjusted terms, list prices have gone up by 3.3% in the first quarter of this year, while net prices declined by 4.1%, the company found.\n\nThe Trump administration is relying on the consumer price index for prescription drugs, a measure of drug price inflation that aims to capture what consumers, along with their insurance companies or other payers, are paying for a basket of retail prescriptions. The Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 most recent figures show the CPI for prescriptions dropped by 2% from June 2018 to June 2019.\n\nThe CPI has its shortcomings. Experts point out that it doesn\u2019t include specialty drugs, which tend to be expensive, and its ability to accurately measure what insurers pay is hindered by what pharmacies can report. But Barry Bosworth a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told us the CPI for prescription drugs is \u201cthe best that is available.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that Democrats don\u2019t have support for some of their claims, but their measures of drug prices have limitations, too, usually pertaining to a subset of drugs, only brand-name drugs or only drug list prices that have increased.\n\nThe list price affects consumers\u2019 copays, coinsurance or deductibles. Evans said insurance beneficiaries at the prescription counter are \u201cexperiencing the list price inflation,\u201d because their out-of-pocket amounts are based on the list prices.\n\nBut the net price paid for a drug can vary considerably from its list price. Evans said the average difference between list and net for brand-name drugs is 47%, as of the end of the first quarter of the year.\n\nWe\u2019ll take a closer look at these measures and what politicians have claimed.\n\nOver the past several months, Trump has repeatedly made some version of the claim, \u201cDrug prices are coming down, first time in 51 years because of my administration.\u201d Last week, in a July 17 campaign rally in North Carolina, he said it again, claiming drug prices went down \u201cfor the first time in over 50 years.\u201d Five days later, on July 22, he upped that to \u201c53 years.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign pointed to the CPI when we inquired about the president\u2019s claim. But it hasn\u2019t been that long since the year-over-year change in the CPI for drugs dipped below zero. Before the recent decline, the CPI had dropped in July 2013, from the year prior.\n\nThe president has used the December 2017 to December 2018 decline of 0.6% as the first \u201ccalendar year\u201d drop since December 1971 to December 1972, which is 46 years prior, not 50. But looking at each month\u2019s 12-month change, which fluctuates, the December decrease was the first in about five-and-half years.\n\nHowever, the CPI now has decreased year-over-year in six of the past seven months, a string of declines that hasn\u2019t occurred since the early 1970s.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the 12-month change in the CPI for prescription drugs since BLS began tracking this measure:\n\nThe measure showed a 2% decrease in June, the largest on record, as Alex Azar, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, noted on July 16 in a cabinet meeting.\n\n\u201cSo, new data in for June that shows that, again, prescription drug prices are going down,\u201d Azar said. \u201cThe Department of Labor\u2019s inflation measure for prescription drug prices, it continues to go down. \u2026 The biggest decrease in over 50 years.\u201d (It\u2019s technically 49 years.)\n\nThe CPI for prescription drugs, as BLS explains, \u201cmeasures price change of drugs purchased with a prescription at a retail, mail order, or internet pharmacy.\u201d The price in this case is \u201cthe total reimbursement to the retailer from the patient and all eligible payers for a single prescription.\u201d That means it includes payments to the pharmacy from consumers, insurance companies or other payers, such as Medicare Part D.\n\nLike other inflation indexes, the measure is based on a sample. It\u2019s a sample of retail pharmacies, and the drug prices measured are a sample drawn from the last 20 prescriptions dispensed at each pharmacy. It makes adjustments for the introduction of generics six months after brand-name drugs\u2019 patents expire.\n\nIt\u2019s a broad measure of transactions at retail pharmacies, but that means it doesn\u2019t measure everything.\n\nWalid Gellad, director of the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh, told us that to answer whether drug prices have gone up or down \u201creally depends on what drug prices you\u2019re talking about.\u201d The CPI, he pointed out, excludes some types of high-price drugs.\n\n\u201cIs it important that the CPI shows drug prices went down? Yes,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cBut it\u2019s misleading to rely solely on the CPI, because it excludes physician and hospital administered drugs, and does not sample specialty pharmacies. \u2026 It also doesn\u2019t adequately account for new drugs that enter the market at [a] very high price.\u201d\n\nGellad mentioned the 2018 Express Scripts Drug Trend Report, which found that spending for traditional drugs went down by 5.8% from 2017 to 2018, while spending on specialty drugs went up 9.4%. Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefit management company, said that those specialty drugs \u201caccount for 44.7 percent of total drug spending, up 3.9 percent from 2017.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo clear it up for your readers, some drugs went up, some went down!\u201d Gellad said.\n\nThe CPI also doesn\u2019t capture rebates that drug manufacturers pay to pharmacy benefit managers or insurers, of course, since those payments occur outside of the retail transaction. Rebates are used as incentives by the manufacturers to get their drugs on insurers\u2019 formularies, or in a preferred placement on those formularies. (For more on rebates, see this explainer video from the Kaiser Family Foundation.)\n\nAntos said it\u2019s difficult to precisely measure what insurers are paying.\n\nBLS is \u201ctrying to do the impossible,\u201d Antos told us in a phone interview, \u201cwhich is isolate the amount that is paid in total on behalf of consumers plus by consumers directly for a drug that they buy at the pharmacy. And as you know, there\u2019s enough complication in the way drug pricing is set, the way formularies are determined,\u201d including rebates and other fees, \u201cthat muddy the water.\u201d\n\nA 2018 report published by the Brookings Institution and National Bureau of Economic Research said the CPI relies \u201cdisproportionately\u201d on cash transactions, which only make up about 7% of the retail drug market, because pharmacies are limited in sharing information from electronic transactions from third-party payers. And it raised questions about how well the CPI was able to capture the transitions to generic medications.\n\nDespite the concerns about the CPI\u2019s limitations, when we contacted the lead author of that report, Brookings\u2019 Bosworth, he said the Trump administration is \u201cright to rely on the CPI,\u201d calling it \u201cthe best that is available.\u201d\n\nBosworth wrote in an email to FactCheck.org that there\u2019s \u201cenormous variability in drug price changes and there is no means of incorporating the initial cost of new drugs\u201d in the CPI. \u201cStill the methods used to calculate the CPI average are superior to the alternatives,\u201d he said, noting that it\u2019s a broad index \u201cthat makes a major effort to be representative of all retail sales of prescription drugs\u201d and factors in the introduction of generics.\n\nBut does the CPI tell us that drug prices have declined? Bosworth said he would \u201caccept [the recent change] as indicative of a sustained change.\u201d\n\nEvans, of SSR Health, said, \u201cIt is factually correct to say drug prices are coming down,\u201d provided that the speaker means \u201cdrug prices at the point of sale.\u201d He added that it\u2019s possible consumers have seen price growth or a decline; there\u2019s no index that calculates only what the consumer pays out of pocket.\n\nSimilarly, Antos said politicians should stick more closely to the technically correct statement \u2014 that the CPI prescription drug price component went down. But what the president and other politicians tend to say \u201cis something that\u2019s looser and therefore has an element of correctness to it but can be misleading.\u201d\n\nOur fact-checking colleagues at the Washington Post and PolitiFact also have looked into these claims, finding concerns from experts over what the CPI can show and that there\u2019s no one, perfect measure on drug prices.\n\nWhat Other Measures Say\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates, meanwhile, have pointed to other reports, but those, too, have their limitations.\n\nFor instance, Harris, in her plan to lower drug prices, said that \u201cfamilies have been slapped with double-digit price increases on 2,500 drugs since Trump took office.\u201d\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar also used the 2,500 figure in the first Democratic debate.\n\n\u201cThe president literally went on TV, on Fox, and said that people\u2019s heads would spin when they see how much he would bring down pharmaceutical prices. \u2026 Instead, 2,500 drugs have gone up in double-digits since he came into office,\u201d Klobuchar said. That refers to a list of drug prices from Pharmacy Benefit Consultants, promoted in a tweet in March 2018 by Andy Slavitt, a former acting administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nBut those figures are from more than a year ago and the claims refer only to those drugs, not drug prices overall.\n\nLast month, CNBC found there had been nearly 1,600 \u2014 not 2,500 \u2014 drug price increases of 10% or more since Trump took office, according to Michael Rea, founder of Rx Savings Solutions. Rea\u2019s figure came from public disclosures of price increases.\n\nHarris also says in her plan that pharmaceutical companies \u201cincreased drug prices by 10.5 percent over the past six months alone,\u201d referring to a Politico story on other figures from Rx Savings Solutions that the company confirmed to FactCheck.org.\n\n\u201cIn the first six months of the year, prices for 3,443 medicines rose, compared to 2,919 last year \u2014 yet the overall size of the price hikes was lower than in the previous period \u2014 10.5 percent compared to 15 percent,\u201d Politico reported.\n\nNote that the 10.5% increase refers to those 3,443 drugs \u2014 not drug prices overall.\n\nThe Harris campaign argues that these measures of list prices, before rebates or other discounts are applied, are the more relevant measures. The CPI, a campaign spokesperson, told us \u201cdoesn\u2019t reflect what consumers are actually paying overall because it doesn\u2019t take rebates into account,\u201d and the index is \u201crepresentative of popular drugs, making it less likely to include newer or less-prescribed drugs, which are more expensive.\u201d\n\nAs we said, the list prices, before rebates, do matter to consumers because their out-of-pocket copays and coinsurance amounts are based on the list prices.\n\nSSR Health has found that the increase in brand-name list prices has slowed. List prices went up 3.3% in real terms in the first quarter of this year but 6.3% in the first quarter of 2018. The company said this was due to a decrease in the number of price hikes of more than 10%, and it said political pressure, dating back to a 2015 tweet about drug pricing from then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, had had an impact.\n\nThe Harris campaign pointed to another measure showing thousands of brand-name drug price hikes. An Associated Press analysis found 2,712 price increases among branded drugs in early January, with a median increase of 5%. Those numbers are down from 3,327 increases in January 2018, with a median hike of nearly 9%, the AP reported, based on data from Elsevier, a health data firm.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s campaign also pointed the Washington Post Fact Checker to such analyses after she claimed in a CNN interview this month that Trump \u201cpromised to lower prescription drug prices and failed.\u201d\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics also provides a producer price index, which measures the price drug manufacturers receive. Richard G. Frank, a professor of health economics at Harvard Medical School, told the Washington Post that he tends to look at that measure, \u201cbecause it is closer to what manufacturers are selling drugs for.\u201d It has been flat in recent months but hasn\u2019t shown year-over-year declines like the CPI. Pointing to that and other market measures, Frank said, \u201cI think the evidence points to slowed growth not negative growth.\u201d\n\nTrump has claimed that drug prices are coming down \u201cbecause of my administration,\u201d but experts questioned that.\n\nWhile Trump has focused on lowering drug prices, Antos told us any administration\u2019s policies wouldn\u2019t have had an impact on the CPI this soon. \u201cIt is fair to say that three years into a presidential administration\u201d \u2014 meaning any administration, he said \u2014 \u201cone should not jump to the conclusion that anything they may have done would have been the primary reason for that particular result.\u201d\n\nIt would take a while, more than three years, to have an impact in either direction \u2014 causing prices to go up or down, he said.\n\nEvans gave one reason for the drop in the CPI, but it didn\u2019t have anything to do with the Trump administration\u2019s policies: a decrease in markups by retail pharmacies. He said there are more pharmacies than needed in the country, so the pharmacy benefit managers have leverage in their negotiations with retail outlets, causing pharmacies to lower their markup amounts.\n\nExpress Scripts credits its \u201cclinical innovations\u201d for a decrease in actual drug costs paid by its insurance plans from 2017 to 2018 while list prices went up.\n\nA Trump campaign spokesperson pointed to the administration\u2019s efforts to more quickly approve generic drugs. Generic applications faced a backlog during the Obama administration, which began to take steps to expedite the approval process, as a 2017 Brookings Institution paper explains. The Food and Drug Administration has continued to prioritize generics.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers noted that generic approvals have been \u201csteadily on the rise\u201d since fiscal year 2014. In fiscal 2018, 781 generics were approved, up significantly from the 409 approved in 2014.\n\nBut it\u2019s unclear how much of an impact this would have had on overall drug prices. Antos said the increase in the introduction of generics \u201cwould\u2019ve had an impact but it wouldn\u2019t have had a huge impact,\u201d and Evans said he didn\u2019t think the decline in the CPI could be explained by a shift to generics, as there weren\u2019t any \u201cbig blockbuster\u201d generic approvals.\n\nIn 2016, the percentage of prescriptions filled with generics was already at 89% (but just 27% of total drug costs), according to a study from the QuintilesIMS Institute, conducted for the Generic Pharmaceutical Association. Update, Aug. 1: In 2018, generics made up 90% of prescriptions filled and 22% of total drug spending, according to the Association for Accessible Medicines (formerly the Generic Pharmaceutical Association), citing IQVIA data.\n\nThe Trump campaign also pointed to some drug companies announcing price freezes in 2018 in response to Trump revealing a plan to lower drug prices (though some companies then planned to raise them in 2019). Other actions by the Trump administration either haven\u2019t been implemented for long or haven\u2019t yet gone into effect, while others don\u2019t pertain to retail drugs measured by the CPI or have been blocked by the courts. For instance, the Trump administration issued a new policy for Medicare Advantage plans, allowing them to use \u201cstep therapy,\u201d which requires enrollees to use lower-cost alternatives to more expensive physician-administered drugs for new prescriptions. But the policy didn\u2019t take effect until Jan. 1, and experts told us last year it was unclear how much impact the policy could have on spending or price.\n\nThe administration has pushed price transparency policies, but a court recently blocked its proposed rule to force drug companies to list prices in TV ads for pharmaceuticals.\n\nDemocratic proposals include setting caps on drug prices based on what other countries pay (Harris), punishing companies for unjustified price hikes and importing drugs from Canada (Gillibrand), and ending pay-for-delay deals that keep generics off the market and allowing the government to negotiate Medicare Part D prices (Klobuchar).\n\nIn touting their plans, politicians have their pick of statistics on drug prices. We\u2019d caution voters to question what exactly those statistics are measuring.", "lang": "en"}
