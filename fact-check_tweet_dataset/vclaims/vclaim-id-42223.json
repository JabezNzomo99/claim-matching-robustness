This video will bring tears to your eyes -translated)\u201d reads the caption of a video, where a woman is supposedly speaking to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over a phone call. The video has gone viral on social media in the backdrop of the Pulwama terror attack. A post by a Facebook pageSwadeshi Lehar has been shared close to 2800 times so far.\n\nMany other individual users on Facebook and Twitter have shared the video with an identical narrative.\n\nOld video, not the wife of army martyr\n\nAlt News found that the video is more than five years old and dates back to the time when Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat. We found a video, uploaded by Zee News\u2018 official YouTube channel on November 2, 2013. \u201cNarendra Modi called on the wife of Patna blast victim from Gopal Ganj, Munna Shrivastav, to offer his condolences. He was unable to visit the village due to bad weather.\u201d, reads the caption attested with the video. Narendra Modi\u2019s website had also published a post along with the same video, now circulating on social media, on November 2, 2013.\n\nThe woman, whom Modi was consoling over a telephonic conversation, seen in the video is Munna Srivastava\u2019s wife, Priya Srivastava. Munna Srivastava was one of five people who were killed in a serial blast that reportedly took place before BJP\u2019s Hunkar rally in October, 2013. An article published by The Indian Express on October 28, 2013, stated, \u201cIn the first such attack in Patna, five people were killed and over 70 injured when serial blasts targeted Narendra Modi\u2019s rally in the state capital\u2019s Gandhi Maidan.\u201d As the weather conditions were unfavourable for Modi\u2019s chopper to land in Srivastava\u2019s town, he was unable to visit the family.\n\nIn conclusion, an old video of a woman, whose husband had died in a serial blasts in Patna in 2013 was circulated widely as PM Modi consoling the wife of a martyr, in the backdrop of the recent terror attack on CRPF personnel in Jammu and Kashmir.", "lang": "en"}
