(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared more than 17,000 times, and we found similar versions shared by other QAnon-related accounts.\n\nThe footage in the video comes from news coverage of a recent FBI raid in downtown Cleveland. But what does that have to do with Ukraine? And how are American politicians involved?\n\nIn short: They aren\u2019t. Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nOn Aug. 4, agents with the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service raided offices in Miami and Cleveland that belong to Optima Management Group LLC. Optima is a Miami investment company that has properties across the country.\n\nThe raid was part of a money laundering investigation that\u2019s been going on for more than a year.\n\n\"The affidavit is under seal so I cannot provide any specifics regarding the investigation,\" FBI Special Agent Vicki Anderson said in an email. \"I can say no one was taken into custody. This continues to be an ongoing investigation.\"\n\nThe Cleveland Plain Dealer reports that Optima is partially owned by principals of the Privat Group, a large business group based in Ukraine. One of those principals is Ukrainian oligarch Igor Kolomoisky\n\nIn the early 1990s, Kolomoisky founded PrivatBank. It became a key banking institution in the country, serving about half of Ukraine\u2019s population.\n\nIn 2016, the government nationalized the company, claiming that it did not have enough capital to support its loan portfolio. The Financial Times reported that PrivatBank lent billions of dollars to Kolomoisky associates.\n\nIn April 2019, the Daily Beast reported that the FBI was investigating Kolomoisky \u2014 who no longer owns PrivatBank and reportedly lives in Israel \u2014 for potential financial crimes, including money laundering. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in the Northern District of Ohio was also part of the investigation since Kolomoisky has investments there.\n\nIn early August, the Justice Department accused Kolomoisky of stealing billions of dollars from PrivatBank and using an array of companies around the world, including some in the United States, to launder the money. Kolomoisky\u2019s lawyer has denied the allegations.\n\nBut how is all that related to Ukraine more broadly?\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky is a former comic, and Kolomoisky owns the TV station that used to air his show. Kolomoisky is considered to be a Zelensky ally.\n\nWhich brings us to the third part of the Facebook post: the connection \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 to American politicians.\n\nIn 2019, a phone call with Zelensky was the subject of President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment. The investigation was prompted by a whistleblower\u2019s complaint about the July 2019 call, during which Trump asked Zelensky to investigate the Biden family\u2019s dealings in Ukraine.\n\nHunter Biden served as a board member for Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, from 2014 until the spring of 2019. He did so when his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, was representing U.S. policy on the country.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence to suggest that the sons of Kerry and Romney ever held similar positions. We rated a similar claim False in October 2019.\n\nRELATED: Pelosi, Romney and Kerry don\u2019t have sons working for companies linked to Ukraine\n\nPelosi\u2019s son, Paul, once served on the board of an American energy company, Viscoil, that dissolved and re-formed in Singapore under a different name. It\u2019s unclear to what extent the company has done business in Ukraine, but Paul Pelosi had no part in the new entity.\n\nIt\u2019s correct to say that a company linked to Ukraine was recently raided by the FBI. But there is no evidence that the sons of Biden, Pelosi, Kerry and Romney got \"tens of millions of dollars from no-show jobs in Ukraine.\" They are all unrelated to the ongoing investigation of Kolomoisky\u2019s alleged money laundering.\n\nThe post is inaccurate. We rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
