Girl is Fatally Shot, Allegedly by Man Who Was Released From Jail Hours Earlier.\u201d The article reported that:\n\n\u201cA 7-year-old North Carolina girl was fatally shot in the head while sitting in a car eating ice cream. \u2018We just lost a 7-year-old innocent child in our family for no reason,\u2019 Kenneth Woods, a relative of Aaliyah Norris told WLOS at a memorial for the girl Thursday night. Aaliyah was sitting in a car in Forest City when she was shot in the head. She was taken to a local hospital, where she remained on life support until succumbing to her injuries two days later, according to a Forest City police news release obtained by PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cOn Wednesday, Shaquille Marshon Francis, 26, was arrested and charged with murder. Francis was arrested earlier on Tuesday for assault by pointing a gun, according to arrest records obtained by WLOS. However, he bonded himself out and three hours later, he allegedly shot Aaliyah.\u201d\n\nDaily Mail and New York Post also published articles that similarly claimed Francis had been arrested and released on bail just three hours before the fatal shooting of Norris.\n\n\u201cForest City Police Chief Chris LeRoy confirmed that 26-year-old Shaquille Francis was released from jail on unrelated charges three hours before he is accused of shooting 7-year-old Aaliyah Norris in the head. \u2018He was arrested at some point, I don\u2019t know if it was yesterday or not. He was released from custody after noon for some unrelated charges,\u2019 LeRoy said.\n\n\u201cRutherford County arrest records show Francis had been arrested the day of the shooting for assault by pointing a gun. Records also indicated he was given no bond. LeRoy said at some point the bond decision changed, and Francis was able to bond himself out.\u201d\n\nThere appears to have been some confusion over the timing of Francis\u2019s initial arrest, and the circumstances surrounding his release. However, all the articles mentioned above accurately reported the following key claim: that Francis, who has been charged with shooting Norris dead, was released from jail, on bail, just three hours before her fatal shooting took place.\n\nAccording to an arrest report obtained by Snopes, a patrol officer from the Rutherford County Sheriff\u2019s Office executed an arrest warrant for Francis at 8:18 p.m. on June 22, on a charge of \u201cassault by pointing a gun.\u201d The details of that charge were not included in the arrest report. A media report published by the Rutherford County Sheriff\u2019s office mistakenly stated that Francis had initially been arrested on June 23 \u2014 in fact, he was arrested the evening before, and spent that night in the Rutherford County Jail.\n\nAn officer at Rutherford County Jail told Snopes that Francis was also arrested on charges of driving on a revoked license and driving without a motorcycle endorsement. A bondsman paid his $5,000 bail bond, and he was released at 2:23 p.m. on June 23.\n\nAt 6:09 p.m. that evening, Forest City Police Department (PD) issued a statement saying it was investigating a shooting that took place around 5 p.m., at the intersection of Oak and Harmon streets in Forest City. According to that initial statement, \u201cthe suspects fled the scene in a black SUV\u201d and \u201cone victim was flown to Spartanburg [Regional Medical Center, South Carolina].\u201d\n\nThat victim was 7-year-old Aaliyah Norris, who had suffered a single gunshot wound to the head, and remained in critical condition on June 23 and 24. According to Forest City Police Department, Francis was arrested without incident on the morning of June 24, and charged with \u201cassault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury with intent to kill, discharging a weapon into occupied property inflicting serious bodily injury, and discharging a firearm within the city limits.\u201d\n\nAn officer at the county jail told Snopes that Francis was booked in at 9:46 a.m. that morning.\n\nNorris died on June 25. At that time, Francis was additionally charged with felony murder, with a bond of $10 million. As of July 8, he remained in the Rutherford County Jail, charged with: assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury with intent to kill; discharging a weapon into occupied property inflicting serious bodily injury; discharging a firearm within the city limits; murder; and four related probation violations.\n\nHe is due in court on July 15 to answer the charge of murder, and on July 13, to answer the other charges against him.\n\nAlthough Francis has not been tried or convicted on any of the aforementioned charges as of this writing, the news articles mentioned above did accurately report the fact that he has been charged with fatally shooting Norris, and that, less than three hours before the shooting, Francis was released on bail.\n\nAs of July 8, a potential motive for the shooting has not been publicly discussed by police or prosecutors, although Forest City Police Chief Chris LeRoy told WLOS that Norris and Francis did know each other.", "lang": "en"}
