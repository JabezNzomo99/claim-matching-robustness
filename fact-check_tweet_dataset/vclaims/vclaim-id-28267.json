In 1983, Nancy Reagan, who had recently launched her \u201cJust Say No (To Drugs)\u201d campaign, invited Mr. T (born Lawrence Tureaud) to the White House for a Christmas event.\n\nMr. T, who wore a sleeveless Santa suit and entertained guests as the first lady gave reporters a tour of the holiday decorations, described the invitation as the most \u201csurprising\u201d thing to happen to him in a 2008 interview:\n\nWhen I got invited to the White House to meet Ronald Reagan in 1983. Nancy Reagan was campaigning to get kids to say no to drugs, and they heard about me going round schools telling kids to stay away from drugs. It was a real honour for a black kid from the ghetto who grew up on welfare.\n\nA contemporary news report from UPI noted that at one point the \u201cFirst Lady took her turn perching on Santa\u2019s lap,\u201d which prompted Mr. T. to joke \u201cBurt Reynolds, eat your heart out.\u201d\n\nAn archived video from ABC News also shows her sitting on Santa Claus\u2019 (a.k.a. Mr. T\u2019s) lap:\n\nThe viral photograph at the center of this article was reportedly taken by Mary Anne Fackelman, a photojournalist who eventually was assigned to cover the first lady. We have been unable to find an official copy of this photograph. However a postcard version on Card Now exists.\n\nNancy Reagan once again invites a popular hero to preside at the White House Christmas festivities for children. Youngsters adore Mr. T and instinctively know he\u2019s a nice guy. Mrs. Reagan appreciates his support in fighting drugs, his interest in young people, and his indefatigable entertaining for her Christmas children. With his usual attire of pounds and pounds of glittering gold, Mr. T gets in the Christmas spirit by donning the red and white Santa suit to pass out goodies and treat children to his uplifting presence. December 12, 1984.\n\nA number of other photographs of the former first lady and Mr. T in his Santa suit are available via Getty Images.
