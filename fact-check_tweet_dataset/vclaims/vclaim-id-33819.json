Vishvas News investigated and found that neither the image has been created by a Japanese neurologist nor it checks a person\u2019s level of stress. The viral claim is false.\n\nAn image shared on Facebook by a user named Naveen Jain reads: \u201cThis is a still image created by a Japanese Neurologist, Yamamoto. As per the Neurologist, if you find it as a still image, you are healthy, if the image appears to be shaky, you are a little stressed or you have not got a sound sleep during night, if you find the image circulating, then you are stressed and you need some rest, if you find the image moving fast, you are highly stressed and you need treatment.\u201d\n\nVishvas News started its investigation by searching about the viral claim on social media. The post has been shared by many users on Facebook.\n\nNot only on Facebook, but the post is also widely circulated on Twitter as well.\n\nWe performed Google reverse image search of the viral photo and found the same photo on Shutterstock, a stock photography company.\n\nThe image in the Shutterstock was posted under the account named \u201cGuten Tag Vector\u201d.\n\nVishvas News checked the profile of the account and found the twitter profile of the user who posted the image.\n\nUsing Twitter Advanced Search, we found the name of the user and his background. The user was Yurii Perepadia.\n\nWe also found the same image on his Twitter account with a time-stamp of September 27, 2016:\n\nVishvas News searched his profile on Facebook as well.\n\nThrough Facebook Messenger, we contacted him and asked about the viral image. He said he is the creator of the image shown in the viral post. He created the image in 2016.\n\nSo, it was clear that the viral image of illusion was created by Yurii Perepadia, who is a graphic designer from Ukraine and not by any Japanese Neurologist.\n\nThe viral post also claimed that the illusion shown in the viral image determines the state of mind.\n\nVishvas News spoke to Dr. Esha Mehta, who is a Psychologist. She said: \u201cIllusions are meant to trick people. This image has nothing to do with the state of mind or to determine the stress levels. The claim is completely false.\u201d\n\nThe post claiming that the image created by a Japanese neurologist checks a person\u2019s level of stress is fake. The post is actually created by Yurii Perepadia, who is a graphic designer from Ukraine. And, it does not determine the state of mind or levels of stress.", "lang": "en"}
