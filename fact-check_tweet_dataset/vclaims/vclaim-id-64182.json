{"title": "FALSE: Sister Mary John Mananzan quote on serving Joma Sison", "subtitle": "Sister Mary John Mananzan did not say this quote", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "Aug 21, 2020 8:17 PM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-64182", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/sister-mary-john-mananzan-quote-serving-joma-sison", "vclaim": "Facebook page Lamrag Sinirangan posted a graphic with Mananzan's photo, attributing to her the following quote: \"I am a Nun serving Lord Joma Sison. Only a fool will believe that I am innocent; sensible people know that I am part of the CPP-NPA-NDF (New People's Army-National Democratic Front).\"\n\nThe graphic also contained the text: \"Si Sister Mananzan ay Chairman Emeritus ng Gabriela Women's Party, na isang prenteng organisasyon ng teroristang CPP-NPA-NDF.\" (Sister Mananzan is Chairman Emeritus of the Gabriela Women's Party, which is a front organization of the terrorist CPP-NPA-NDF.)\n\nThe post had the caption: \"BABALA!!! Mapagkunwaring madre. Akala mo Diyos ang pinagsisilbihan. Si Teroristang JOMA SISON pala.\" (WARNING! Pretending to be a nun. You would think she serves the Lord, but in truth she serves the terrorist Joma Sison.)\n\nIn an email to Rappler, Mananzan denied saying this. Moreover, Rappler did not find any reports, video or audio recordings, interview transcripts, or statements that contain the supposed quote.\n\nRappler also reached out to Lamrag Sinirangan to ask for proof that Mananzan said this quote, but received no response as of writing.\n\nThis is not the first time Mananzan was red-tagged. Presidential Communications Undersecretary Lorraine Badoy earlier accused her of being \"given a place of honor in a communist terrorist organization.\" Gabriela and the Movement Against Tyranny spoke out then against Badoy.\n\nIn the past, Rappler fact-checked another false quote attributed to Mananzan, wherein she supposedly called for the ouster of President Rodrigo Duterte and his replacement with Vice President Leni Robredo. \u2013 Loreben Tuquero/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
