People in the video are showing aggression and chanting \u201cyou have to say Allah Hu Akbar if you want to stay in India\u201d in Hindi. According to the description written with the video, this procession was held in Agra in support of Tabrez Ansari. In our investigation we found that this video was shot at Muharram event in Gopalganj in the year 2014, and not at the protest against Tabrez Ansari\u2019s lynching.\n\nA large number of people in the video can be seen with swords. The description is: \u201cThe biggest procession in Agra in support of Tabaraz Ansari, you have to say Allah Hu Akbar if you want to stay in India, Dalit Muslims come together for the procession.\u201d\n\nWe looked at the viral video properly and checked its audio too. No one can be seen lip syncing the slogan that can be heard in the video. This viral video is 1 minute 48 seconds, in which there is a sound of slogans for 1 minute and 38 seconds and rest 10 seconds are blank.\n\nTo start your investigation, we read the comments of this video and found that a person wrote in the comment that this video was not of any protest but was shot at the time of Muharram in Gopalganj. We based our investigation on this comment and performed Google reverse image search. We searched with the words of \u2018Gopalganj Muharram\u2019 on YouTube and we found a video of 2014 with description \u201cGopalganj Muharram 2014.\u201d In this video, only drum sound could be heard, no chanting. The video is otherwise similar to the viral video.\n\nFor more confirmation in this matter, we spoke to Agra SSP Babloo Kumar who told us that this video is not from Agra.\n\nNow we had to find out the source of the chants that could be heard in the viral video. When we searched, we found a video in which the exact audio of the viral video could be heard. This video was shot on December 8, 2017 in the Chetak circle of Udaipur city when a rally was organized by the Muslim community in Udaipur against Shambhulal Ragar. The audio of the same video has been superimposed on the viral video to give it fake pretext.\n\nThis video was shared by a page called Dhaka New imim Club on July 4, 2019, and this video has been shared 19000 times until this story is published. The page has 42,993 members.\n\nConclusion: In our investigation we found that this video was shot at Muharram event in Gopalganj in the year 2014, and not at the protest against Tabrez Ansari\u2019s lynching.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right.
