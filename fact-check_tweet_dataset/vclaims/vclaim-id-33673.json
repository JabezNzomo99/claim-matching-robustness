No, that's not true: A video posted on YouTube and widely shared across social platforms is a concept created by a company not affiliated with Apple. It is only speculation and there is no evidence that Apple has revealed specifications and design features to the video producer. The producer acknowledged that it is not even based on rumors, but just on their ideas of what would be \"the perfectly designed iPhone.\" Unfortunately, that admission is not seen by most people sharing the video.\n\nThe claim originated from a video (archived here) posted on the ConceptsiPhone YouTube channel in October 2019 under the title \"iPhone 12 Pro Official Trailer, Apple 2020\".
