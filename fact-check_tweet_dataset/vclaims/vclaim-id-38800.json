No, that's not true: There is no proof that such a claim, which has been debunked before, came from the Muslim commmunity in Manchester. Yet the rumor has continued to circulate on social media since at least 2016.\n\nThe claim resurfaced in an article published by KLA News on February 26, 2020, titled \"Muslims Demand Locals Don't Walk Dogs In Public - Violation Of Sharia And \"Disrespects\" Them - KLA News\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media saw this:\n\nThe claim is a hoax dating back to at least 2016, when, on July 11, the Facebook group calling itself For Public Purity posted:\n\nThat same group name was listed on the flyer posted in Manchester, England, the same year as the Facebook post - 2016 - that asked residents to \"limit the presence of dogs in the public sphere\" out of respect for the area's \"large Muslim community.\" But the group's authenticity has been called out by The Telegraph, BuzzfeedNews.com and Snopes.com. As Buzzfeed.com and the Toronto Star jointly reported, similar signs, allegedly posted by the same group, appeared in Pitt Meadows, British Columbia, in 2017.\n\nIn both instances, Muslim leaders, as well as government officials, denied posting the flyers - raising the possibility that an anti-Islam hoax was at play. Local Muslim groups in Manchester, for example, said that they had never heard of For Public Purity and believed the flyers were an attempt to increase anti-Muslim sentiment.\n\nBuzzfeedNews.com reported there was evidence that the flyer was \"either started, or helped along, by 4chan trolls.\" The site noted users were posting about the public outrage and warned others to leave the full name of \"the P-blicP-rity website\" out so that their archives would not be searched and outed.\n\nThe For Public Purity Facebook page has not put up anything since the July 11, 2016, post.\n\nSome commenters on the post were outraged:\n\nHowever, others called out the post for the outrageous claims:\n\nHere is a snapshot of some of the back-and-forth on the For Public Purity page:\n\n\n\nOn April 4, 2018, the story circulated again on the Black Sphere Facebook page, a conservative website in the United States that shared the story with their followers - who were outraged.\n\nWith 6,000 likes and 4,000 shares on the Blake Sphere Facebook post, comments flowed in with anti-Muslim sentiment.", "lang": "en"}
