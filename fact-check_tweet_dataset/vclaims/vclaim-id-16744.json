What the DWP is planning to do to Glasgow is to cut it by 50%. Why is this government planning to disproportionately cut vital Jobcentres in some of the most deprived communities in our country?\u201d\n\nThe Department for Work and Pensions confirmed to us that reports of Jobcentre Plus closures in Glasgow are true.\n\nBBC Scotland reports that eight of the 16 Jobcentre Plus offices in Glasgow are to be closed. The DWP says that there should be no job losses, and that benefits claimants won\u2019t have to travel for more than four miles or for longer than 40 minutes to an office.\n\nIt\u2019s also correct that, under plans announced in November 2016, the DWP is aiming to occupy \u201c20% less estate\u201d nationally. This comes on top of a 17% reduction in the last parliament, according to Civil Service World.\n\nThe comparison isn\u2019t quite exact: the 20% reduction in the DWP\u2019s buildings could conceivably include back offices, not just Jobcentre Plus facilities.\n\nDavid Lidington, standing in for the Prime Minister, said that the important thing is \u201cnot the raw number of offices that there should be, but about how accessible the offices and the services which they provide continue to be for the people who need to use them\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
