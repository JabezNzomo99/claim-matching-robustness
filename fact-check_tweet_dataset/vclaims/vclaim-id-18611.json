Talent flows in the family for generations,\u201d text accompanying the viral post claims.\n\nBOOM also received the video on its helpline (7700906111).\n\nBOOM was able to ascertain that the contestant is Pickosa Moharkar, who hails from Nagpur and not Muktika Ganguly. We also reached out to the PR team of the show, who corroborated the same.\n\nIn fact, we were then directed to another clip featuring Ankita Bhattacharya of Zee Sa Re Ga Ma Pa in Bangla, where her performance of Chala Jaata Hun was viral with the same claim.\n\nThe same was viral on Facebook.\n\nWe also reached out to the show\u2019s host Ravi Dubey.\n\n\u201cI am not aware of any such connection between Pickosa and Kishore Kumar,\u201d he said.\n\nInterestingly, Pickosa has earned rave reviews from the show\u2019s judges for yodeling at such a young age. Yodeling is often associated with Kishore Kumar, who popularised the style of singing in India.\n\nBOOM also found that Muktika Ganguly, Amit Kumar\u2019s daughter is not part of Zee\u2019s show. Muktika, who is a singer, launched her album Baba Mere in 2015. Below is a video of the album launch.\n\nBelow is the teaser of the album.", "lang": "en"}
