I\u2019ve actually been called an environmentalist, if you can believe that.\u201d\n\nThe short answer is: No. Media outlets and environmental groups have tried to find evidence of this claim since 2011 but have come up short. We could not readily find references to Trump\u2019s environmental awards in news coverage over the past 10 years. We checked with the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Sierra Club, and none had any record of Trump\u2019s environmental awards.\n\nIn fact, environmentalists have criticized many of Trump\u2019s projects. In 2008, Trump faced backlash from local officials and environmentalists in Scotland when he proposed to build a golf course on protected sand dunes. During a hearing on the project, Trump called the state of the site \u201ckind of disgusting.\u201d\n\nChelsea Henderson, who has worked on environmental policy for Republican lawmakers and conservation organizations for two decades, conducted a thorough search of Trump\u2019s environmental record \u2014 on clean water and air, and the use of green energy in his real estate projects. Trump had one certification in progress with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), but LEED is a building certification, not an award.\n\nThe book does not list any environmental awards. (It does mention awards that Russo believes Trump should have received.) The only award it mentions is one supposedly from the New Jersey Audubon Society: \u201cNew Jersey Audubon offered to recognize the work that was done at Trump National Bedminster \u2014 but not with an award to Donald, just to \u2018Trump National.\u2019 That wasn\u2019t right,\u201d Russo wrote.\n\n[Update: Our readers found one award that Trump himself received. The Friends of Westchester County Parks, Inc., gave Trump a \u201cGreen Space Award\u201d in 2007 for donating 436 acres of land to the state of New York. Trump had purchased the land in the 1990s to build a golf course, but withdrew plans after facing opposition from local residents and environmental restrictions.\n\nThe evidence is quite slim for Trump\u2019s claim that he has \u201creceived awards on the environment.\u201d We know of one award by the Metropolitan Golf Association, given in 2007 to his golf course in Bedminster, N.J. The golf course was later cited for environmental violations.\n\nThe White House pointed us to a self-published book by Trump\u2019s former environmental consultant. The only award mentioned in that book was from New Jersey Audubon \u2014 but the group denied it ever gave an award to Trump, the Trump National club in Bedminster or any of its employees.\n\nHere is one award that we\u2019ll give to Trump. It\u2019s not related to the environment \u2014 and he already has many of them \u2014 but we present Trump with his first four-Pinocchio rating as president.", "lang": "en"}
