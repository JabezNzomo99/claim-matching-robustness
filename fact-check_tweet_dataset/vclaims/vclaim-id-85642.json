Predictably, they began discrediting the award. Right-wing propaganda website OpIndia published an article titled, \u201cJoseph Pulitzer \u2013 the story of the founder of the Pulitzer Prizes, and the Father of Yellow Journalism\u201d where it argued that \u201cThe \u201cOscar\u201d of journalism is named after a man who arguably laid the foundation for what would be known later as \u201cyellow journalism\u201d, a sensationalist press that is the predecessor to today\u2019s tabloid news and fake news phenomenon\u201d.\n\nAlt News found that not just the above-stated quote which forms the basis for OpIndia\u2019s article, but the entire article is heavily plagiarised from multiple sources and infringes on copyright violation. This was first pointed out by Twitter user @kundansonu.\n\nPlagiarism or presenting someone else\u2019s work as your own is considered \u201cone of the primary sins of journalism\u201d. The rules are simple \u2013 passages copied exactly from others should be put in quotation marks and attributed to the source.\n\nThe Opindia article replicates entire passages verbatim from at least two sources without crediting them. Alt News checked the article using the tool \u2018Copyscape\u2019 and found several glaring instances where entire passages were presented as their own work.\n\nOpIndia has copied verbatim 135 words or 13% of the text from the website, Vintage News.\n\nShockingly, this includes the quote \u2013 \u201cThe \u201cOscar\u201d of journalism is named after a man who arguably laid the foundation for what would be known later as \u201cyellow journalism\u201d, a sensationalist press that is the predecessor to today\u2019s tabloid news and fake news phenomenon\u201d \u2013 that is used in OpIndia\u2019s tweet as well as the subheading of the article.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the portions directly copied from Vintage News. On the left are excerpts from OpIndia\u2019s story and on the right are passages from Vintage News.\n\n42% of the text, i.e., 436 words out of the 1050 word article were copied from a single source, which is the US Department of state archive.\n\nThe same content is also available on the Department of State, Office of the Historian website. OpIndia has copied entire passages without using quotation marks.\n\nA side-by-side comparison of the two texts (left \u2013 Opindia and right \u2013 US State Department) shows the full extent of the similarity. (Note: This is only an extract of the 436 similarities)\n\nInstead of crediting the original source i.e. the US State Department, from which 42% of the text is copied, OpIndia credits History.com website of A&E Networks which has 149 words or 14% matching text, also sourced from the State Department.\n\nThe terms of service of Vintage News clearly states that all content on the website is protected by copyright.\n\nThe copyright information on the US State Department reads, \u201cUnless a copyright is indicated, information on the State Department\u2019s main website is in the public domain and may be copied and distributed without permission. Citation of the US State Department as source of the information is appreciated.\u201d\n\nIt must be pointed out that while there is no legal requirement to give credit to content that is sourced from the public domain, content from public domain if passed off as own piece of work, still falls under the definition of plagiarism. As explained in Stanford Copyright and Fair use guidelines, \u201cWhen copying works from the public domain, be careful to avoid plagiarism. Plagiarism occurs when someone poses as the originator of words he did not write, ideas he did not conceive, or facts he did not discover.\u201d\n\nIt is ironical that an article written to criticize the Pulitzer prize and point out its origins in sensationalist yellow journalism turns out to be heavily plagiarized. Nearly half of the article is identical to the US Department of State open-source content but is not credited. The main argument of OpIndia\u2019s piece, which is also the subheading, is lifted from another website. With random bits replicated in entirety from internet sources, this is an example of \u2018copy-paste journalism\u2019 at its worst. Numerous plagiarism detection tools are available on the internet yet, copied content makes its way to published articles. In the past Alt News had found shocking instances of plagiarism in the publications of a premier right-wing think tank, India Foundation.", "lang": "en"}
