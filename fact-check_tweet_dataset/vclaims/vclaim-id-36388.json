The claim is false but Nigeria\u2019s central bank is silent on where the punitive charges go or how they are used.\n\nThe claim was first shared on September 18, 2018, in a series of tweets on this Twitter account belonging to popular UK-based Nigerian medical doctor Harvey Olufunmilayo. The account has more than 100,000 followers.\n\nThe tweet has been shared nearly 7,000 times and reposted word for word in at least 100 Facebook and Instagram posts, as well as tweets. We've archived some of the posts here, here and here.\n\nThe caption on the tweet reads: \u201cIF any Nigerian Bank fails to return your money within 24 hours of a failed online transfer, they will be fined 10,000 naira. The money goes to YOU! All you need to do is report the issue to Central Bank (cpd@cbn.gov.ng) and they will surely take it up.\u201d\n\nThe claim was shared alongside three screenshots, among them contact details for the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and an excerpt from the bank's announcement about the directive.\n\nNigerians largely rely on interbank instant payment channels for electronic transactions, but issues around failed and delayed payments remain a concern for the country which aims to financially include more of its inhabitants.\n\nThe claim is false, however, although the policy does exist.\n\nWhat the regulation says\n\nThe central bank issued a circular to all financial institutions in September 2018, directing them to reverse failed payments -- official name being Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) Instant Payment (NIP) -- into customers\u2019 accounts within a day, or pay a 10,000 naira ($28) fine for each item \u201cbased on complaints of sender and/ or beneficiary.\u201d\n\nA similar sanction also exists for receiving banks that take more than four minutes to release funds into their customers' accounts.\n\nThese regulations on instant electronic funds transfer services in Nigeria are the central bank's attempt to \"facilitate the development of an efficient and effective payments system\" in the country and were effective on October 2, 2018.\n\nYet, more than a year later, misinformation around the regulation continues, like these Facebook posts published this year here and here, as well as this tweet with more than 9,000 likes.\n\nWhy the claim is false\n\nThere is no evidence to support the claim in the 14-page circular issued by the central bank on instant (inter-bank) electronic funds transfer services in the country, and neither was any official quoted saying affected customers stand in line to get the payment.\n\nIn fact, AFP found that the regulation is completely silent on where each 10,000 naira fine goes.\n\nCentral bank spokesman Isaac Okoroafor confirmed the claim was false. \u201cThe penalty for failed transactions does not go to the customer,\u201d he said in an email to AFP.\n\nAderonke Akinsola, a banking analyst at Lagos-based investment bank Chapel Hill Denham, said there is no basis for the money to be paid to affected customers. \u201cThe payment goes to the regulator because it\u2019s putting a policy (in place) for them (banks) to follow, and if they don't comply with the regulations, the fine would be a source of income to the regulator.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
