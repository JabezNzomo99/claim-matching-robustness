Now, Alt News has received a press release claimed to be issued by the Prime Minister of India\u2019s Office. Social media users have sent us the document on our official WhatsApp number.\n\nThe press release is dated March 18, 2020, and is titled, \u201cNATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, PRIME MINISTER\u2019S OFFICE\u201d.\n\nThe document informs about \u201cRestricted Movement Order\u201d from March 18 to March 31, 2020. \u201cThe National Security Council had a coordination meeting between government agencies on 17 March 2020 to ensure the smooth implementation of the Order,\u201d states the document.\n\nThe press release hints at a potential lockdown when it says, \u201cTo ensure the effectiveness of the Order, the general public is advised to stay home at all times except to fulfil basic needs.\u201d It may be noted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called for a 14-hour voluntary lockdown on March 22.\n\nA user posted a screenshot of the \u201cpress release\u201d and asked for a confirmation on the authenticity of the document while tagging the official Twitter handle of PMO India.\n\nAlt News found that the above press release has not been issued by the Indian Prime Minister\u2019s office. The press release has nothing to do with the Indian government. In fact, the document doesn\u2019t even mention the word \u2018India\u2019 or \u2018Indians\u2019 even for once.\n\nA Google search with keywords (\u201cRestricted Movement Order\u201c) revealed that the order was issued by the Malaysian National Security Council. We then searched for the word Malaysia (in the document) and found the phrase, \u201cMalaysians working in Singapore/Thailand/ Brunei / Indonesia\u201d. This corroborates the fact that a document was issued by the Malaysian government for their citizens as it talks about Malaysian nationals.\n\nOn March 18, Singapore-based media outlet Channel News Asia reported, \u201cThe Malaysia government on Wednesday (Mar 18) imposed a restricted movement order that bars its citizens from going overseas and foreigners from entering the country until the end of March.\u201d According to this explainer, all foreigners including Singaporeans with Malaysian permanent residence who are not employed in \u201cessential services\u201d will be not be allowed to enter Malaysia during the period of Restricted Movement Order. The same press release in Malay can be found on the official website of Malaysia\u2019s PMO.\n\nPress Information Bureau\u2019s (PIB) fact-check wing has rubbished the press release and stated that no such document has been issued by the Indian PMO.\n\nAccording to Channel News Asia\u2019stracker, the country\u2019s total number of COVID-19 positive cases has surged to 1,180.\n\nIn conclusion, a document which essentially talks about the \u201cRestricted Movement Order\u201d issued by the Malaysian government is doing the rounds on the Indian social media ecosystem with an impression that it was issued by the Indian government.", "lang": "en"}
