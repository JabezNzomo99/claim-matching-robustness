She was answering the following question: \u201cIf Donald Trump is reelected, and continues to behave corruptly, and with a disregard for truth, human dignity, and the law, what recourse will the House have, since the impeachment process will already have taken place? What will the checks be on this president if he is reelected?\u201d\n\nPelosi responded, \u201cLet\u2019s not even contemplate that\u201d before she moved on to broadly critique the Trump administration for the \u201cdamage\u201d it has done to the country.\n\nShe ended her response by stating, \u201cSo, again, we don\u2019t agonize. We organize. And we do so in a way that, again, is unifying for our country. It is absolutely imperative. Civilization, as we know it today, is at stake in the next election, and certainly, our planet.\u201d\n\nAlthough Pelosi\u2019s comments were being circulated in May 2020 amid an ongoing COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic, she originally made them in a different context. That same day, Dec. 5, 2019, the U.S. House of Representatives moved forward to draft articles of impeachment against Trump. The articles ultimately charged him with abuse of power and obstructing Congress for pressuring the Ukrainian president to produce damaging information on Trump\u2019s Democratic political rival Joe Biden while Trump withheld crucial U.S. military aid. Trump was later acquitted by the U.S. Senate of both articles in February 2020.", "lang": "en"}
