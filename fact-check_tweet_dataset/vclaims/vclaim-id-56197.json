The original video, posted Nov. 12, 2019, predates the first coronavirus case reported in the U.S. by roughly two months.\n\n\u201cSandra has daily pools of water and really likes to wash things \u2013 her toys, her surroundings, and her hands!\u201d reads the original caption. \u201cSandra loves to clean up! #orangutancaringweek #cleanhands #bubblesarebest.\u201d (RELATED: No, Eating Alkaline Foods Won\u2019t \u2018Beat\u2019 Coronavirus)\n\nFeatured in the video is Sandra, a 34-year-old orangutan who previously lived at zoos in Argentina and Spain, according to the Center for Great Apes website. The video of Sandra washing her hands was taken shortly after she arrived at the sanctuary in November 2019.\n\nThe Center for Great Apes posted the same video of Sandra again on March 14 with the caption saying that the orangutan \u201cdefinitely scrubbed her hands for longer than 20 seconds.\u201d That new caption likely references the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) recommendation of thorough hand-washing as a measure to protect against COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\nThe CDC also advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth, practice social distancing and wear cloth face covers in public to reduce the risk of contracting the new coronavirus.", "lang": "en"}
