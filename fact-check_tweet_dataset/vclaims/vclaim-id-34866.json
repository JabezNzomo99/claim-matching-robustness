Residents living near the volcano were urged to use masks when ash rains down and those living along the rivers upstream were warned of cold lava floods during rains. There were no reports of casualties.Watch till the end\".\n\nA Facebook search of the caption revealed that the video has been posted several times over with similar captions over the last two days.\n\nBOOM did a reverse image search on Google with keyframes from the video and was led to several articles about a simulation videoof an underwater volcanic explosion.\n\nAccording to Express, in October 2017, an Australian geologist and a team of producers created \"a video simulation of a huge volcanic eruption beneath the surface off the coast of Auckland, New Zealand, to show just how devastating they can be\".\n\nThe video was subsequently uploaded by a YouTube channel named Auckland War Memorial Museum.\n\nMount Sinabung is one of Indonesia's active volcanoes which went through an eruption less than 10 days ago.\n\nBOOM looked at the real video of the eruption and found that the eruption happened above sea level and not underwater.", "lang": "en"}
