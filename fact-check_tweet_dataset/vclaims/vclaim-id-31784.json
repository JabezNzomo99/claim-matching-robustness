[1]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined Mr Albanese\u2019s claim one in four voters didn\u2019t vote for either Labor or the Coalition.\n\nMore than 16.4 million Australians were enrolled to vote in the May 18 election. [2]\n\nWith over 86 per cent of the votes counted, over 5.5 million Australians chose the Coalition while over 4.4 million went with Labor.\n\nABC election analyst Antony Green told AAP FactCheck that in percentage terms \u201cthe Coalition is on 41.7, Labor is on 33.5, so that\u2019s 75.2 - that\u2019s only three quarters of the vote that is for the two major sides of politics.\u201d\n\nBased on these figures, Mr Green said Mr Albanese\u2019s claim was correct.\n\nAccording to the Australian Electoral Commission figures, which are being updated as the count progresses, of the 25 per cent of voters who shunned the major parties, the Greens scored the most with 1.3 million votes or over 10 per cent. [3]\n\nThe independents won as many votes as Clive Palmer\u2019s United Australia Party with 3.4 per cent or approximately 455,000 votes. One Nation scored three per cent or just over 410,000 votes. [3]\n\nNo other party polled above one per cent.\n\nBased on these figures AAP FactCheck found Mr Albanese\u2019s claim to be true.", "lang": "en"}
