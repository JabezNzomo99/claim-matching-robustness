No, that's not true. The news was made up by a site that likes to take tidbits of real news and events and then adds a headline to their own version of the story to make it more clickbait-worthy in order to attract more visitors and earn more money through advertising. Trump has made no such announcement (yet, you never know).\n\nThe story originated from an article published by YourNewsWire on June 27, 2018 titled \"Trump: Judge Jeanine Pirro Will Be Next Supreme Court Justice\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nJudge Jeanine Pirro is one of President Trump's top picks for Supreme Court Justice, according to Donald Trump Jr. Following the announcement Wednesday that Justice Associate Anthony Kennedy will retire in July, Trump Jr. hinted that his father is eyeing the outspoken Conservative judge as a likely replacement.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nAll of that is not really what happened. A marketing researcher and pollitical polling writer named Josh Jordan suggested on Twitter Pirro could become the next justice on the Supreme Court but he quickly added he only meant it sarcastically. Donald Trump Jr. then retweeted the joke tweet and added several emoticons indicating tears of laughter.\n\nThere you have it: two tweets obviously meant in jest and YourNewsWire turns it into something that is definitely happening.\n\nOf course Trump is free to nominate anyone he chooses to the Supreme Court, as long as he can get the Senate to confirm the nomination. So it still might happen but it seems higly unlikely.\n\nYourNewsWire has published several hoaxes and fake news articles in the past so anything they write or publish should be taken with a large grain of salt. Their Facebook page \"The People's Voice\" recently lost its verification checkmark according to a report from MMFA.\n\nThe Terms of Use of the site also make it clear they don't really stand behind the accuracy of any of their reporting:\n\nThe site was profiled in the Hollywood reporter where it was described as:\n\nRationalWiki described it as:\n\nA while ago we also reported that YourNewsWire had rebranded itself as NewsPunch by changing its domain name in an apparent effort to evade filtering/blocking. It appears the site has changed back to it's old name in the mean time but you can still see the NewsPunch name in the contact email address in the footer.\n\nWe wrote about yournewswire.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Former Clinton Aide Indicted For Child Sex Trafficking\n\u2022 Fake News: Pope Francis Did NOT Say US Must Open Borders To 'As Many Migrants As Possible'\n\u2022 Fake News: Pope Francis Did NOT Give Pedophile Priest Diplomatic Immunity To Avoid Prison\n\u2022 Fake News: IG Report Did NOT Say Hillary Clinton Ran Child Sex Ring\n\u2022 Fake News: President Macron Did NOT Knowingly Grant ISIS Chief Political Asylum In France", "lang": "en"}
