It had accumulated more than 14,000 shares at the time of writing. Posted by Being Hindu on Tuesday, September 11, 2018\n\nAlt News reverse-searched the image shared by Being Hindu on Google and found an old tweet from the official handle of Barack Obama which had the same image. On 30 August 2012, he had tweeted, \u201cPresident Obama is answering your questions in a Reddit AMA, starting right now: President Obama is answering your questions in a #Reddit AMA, starting right now: http://t.co/f00rEdkn, pic.twitter.com/Q5gWHTTM \u2014 Barack Obama (@BarackObama) August 29, 2012\n\nA photograph shared by India Dekho was unrelated to the claims made by the page. This image was clicked by photographer Matthew Healey for Getty Images on 13 August 2013. Obama and his family were on an eight-day vacation at Martha\u2019s Vineyard on Massachusetts island during his presidential years. The caption states that Obama was placing an order at a restaurant. While the third image posted by Doval Fan Club was Obama serving Thanksgiving dinner to residents at the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Washington, DC. It was clicked by Shawn Thew, a photographer for Associated Press on 23 November 2016. The caption reads, \u201cUnited States President Barack Obama, with First Lady Michelle Obama, shakes hands while serving Thanksgiving dinner to residents at the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Washington, DC, USA, 23 November 2016.\u201d\n\nFrom vacations to speeches to international travel, Barack Obama\u2019s life is under constant media scrutiny even after the end of his presidential term. In such a scenario, Obama pursuing a private job would have been reported widely. However, we found no media reports that would suggest that Obama had taken up a private job. According to media, in terms of professional engagements, the Obamas have inked a book deal and an agreement with Netflix. Michelle and Barack Obama have signed a deal with Netflix to produce a set of films and series. An article published by Reuters on 21 May 2018 stated, \u201cThe Obamas will have hands-on involvement in producing content and will appear personally in some of the shows while curating others, said a person familiar with the deal.\u201d President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama have entered into a multi-year agreement to produce films and series for Netflix, potentially including scripted series, unscripted series, docu-series, documentaries, and features. \u2014 Netflix US (@netflix) May 21, 2018 Michelle and Barack Obama have also inked a multi-million dollar book deal reportedly with Penguin Random House which is pegged anywhere from from $30 million to $65 million for two books. According to report published by CNN Money, Obama\u2019s pension payment will be $207,800, about half of his presidential salary. Facebook pages like India Dekho and Being Hindu have often been found to make such misleading claims which helps them garner followers and circulation for their posts.", "lang": "en"}
