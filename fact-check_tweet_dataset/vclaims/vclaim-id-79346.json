No, that's not true: Biden was quoting what the Trump campaign was saying about him and went on to remark that their \"proof\" was \"the violence we're seeing in Donald Trump's America\". The phrase \"You won't be safe in Joe Biden's America\" that Biden was quoting was used by Vice President Mike Pence in a speech during the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe claim was made in a misleading video clip tweeted by the Trump campaign on August 31, 2020 via the \"Trump War Room \" account (archived here) which read:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Twitter at the time of writing:\n\nHere is an embedded version of the tweet:\n\nThe video omits the first part of the sentence to make it appear Biden is speaking these words about himself. However the full context of Biden's remark reads:\n\nYou can see Biden's remarks for yourself here, in a video streamed from Pittsburg, PA during a recent campaign event:\n\nHere is the part of Mike Pence's RNC speech Biden appears to be talking about and where he says the exact phrase Biden is quoting:", "lang": "en"}
