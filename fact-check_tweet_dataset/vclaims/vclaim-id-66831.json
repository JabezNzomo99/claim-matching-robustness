A claim out of the Democratic Party that numerous fact-checkers debunked in 2010 has made its way to the 2014 Iowa Senate race.\n\nattacks Republican candidate Joni Ernst, painting her as beholden to special interest groups because she signed a pledge. The ad comes from NextGen Climate Action Committee, a liberal political action committee.\n\nThe ad shows a dimly lit room, with two men looking at a picture of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on a screen, while laughing in a slow, almost crazed manner. The screen switches to a picture of Ernst.\n\n\"We got her to pledge? Joni signed on the line,\" the ad says. \"The tax breaks that thing protects are gold. Green light more outsourcing! China, Mexico. All the way.\"\n\nText on the screen says, \"Ernst\u2019s Pledge: Protects Tax Breaks for Companies that Ship Jobs Overseas.\"\n\nEven though the ad is new, this claim -- that a person who signs the Americans for Tax Reform\u2019s pledge is in favor of tax breaks that encourage outsourcing -- is not.\n\nIn 2010, PolitiFact Virginia checked a similar statement, that a state legislature candidate \"supports the tax loopholes that send American jobs overseas.\" They rated the claim .\n\nThe same year, our friends at Factcheck.org found the claim, used against a Republican House candidate from Hawaii, to be . And they that pro-Democratic groups that used the attack ads in quite a number of ads. The also said the claim was wrong in 2010.\n\nIt seems like there\u2019s a consensus that the claim is off-target, but because it\u2019s been four years, we decided to look at it again.\n\nThe pledge that the ad is talking about the Taxpayer Protection Pledge -- crafted by Americans for Tax Reform, Grover Norquist\u2019s anti-tax group, in 1986. Lawmakers who sign it pledge to fight tax increases. Ernst signed the federal pledge back in .\n\nDemocrats say this means Ernst and other signers pledge to protect tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas. That\u2019s a stretch.\n\nFor one, the text of the pledge is brief and does not take positions on specific issues, like protecting companies with employees in other countries. It says nothing about jobs or changing tax code.\n\nI, ______, pledge to the taxpayers of the ______ district of the state of ______ and to the American people that I will:\n\nOne, oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses; and\n\nTwo, oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.\n\nDemocrats have said Americans for Tax Reform has pressured signers to vote in ways that would prevent closing tax benefits for companies that conduct business overseas.\n\nNextGen Climate pointed us to on a bill that provided $26 billion in aid to states and localities.\n\nIn August 2010, Americans for Tax Reform said the bill ( , which passed) violated the Taxpayer Protection Pledge. The bill included increased spending that would be by closing tax loopholes for American companies that do business overseas. The changes didn\u2019t specifically address workers or where employees are located.\n\nNextGen Climate is essentially arguing that because Americans for Tax Reform told pledge signers not to vote for this bill all pledge signers support outsourcing protections.\n\nWe see two primary issues with this evidence.\n\nFirst, Americans for Tax Reform\u2019s main problem with the bill is that it eliminated a tax credit without finding another avenue to reduce taxes by the same amount, which the pledge requires.\n\nPeople who sign the pledge wouldn\u2019t support any tax increase or tax credit elimination, no matter the context, so it is misleading to tie their tax positions to other issues like outsourcing, said Eric Toder, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a think tank.\n\n\"They wouldn\u2019t close a (tax) subsidy to bring jobs home, either,\" Toder said.\n\nIn theory, signers could have voted for the 2010 bill if it had eliminated other taxes to make up for closing the loopholes.\n\nSecond, this particular vote happened in 2010, almost three years before Ernst signed the pledge, and she was not in an elected position at the time -- let alone in a position in which she would have voted on this bill. She has no ties to this legislation.\n\nAn ad by NextGen Climate Action Committee said Ernst signed a pledge that \"protects tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas.\"\n\nErnst signed the Taxpayer Protection pledge, a promise promoted by Americans for Tax Reform, which is a broad vow to oppose all tax increases. It does not specify protecting tax loopholes for companies that have employees overseas. In one instance, Americans for Tax Reform urged signers to vote against a bill that closed one of these loopholes, but the decision was more about stopping a tax increase than protecting outsourcing, and Ernst had yet to sign the pledge then, anyway.", "lang": "en"}
