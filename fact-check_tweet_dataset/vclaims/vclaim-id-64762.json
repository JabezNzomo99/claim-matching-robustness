We've done a lot of big things, with Ikea, Jersey Gardens, and we have opportunities here in our community. Our jobless rate, our unemployment rate, is the lowest of all of the big cities in New Jersey,\" Bollwage said during a Jan. 15 speech at the Cuban Club, drawing applause from his audience. \"That's a great testament to our community.\"\n\n \n\n You may want to hold back your applause, though, because the mayor is wrong.\n\n \n\n A reader asked PolitiFact New Jersey to check out Bollwage\u2019s claim. We found Elizabeth\u2019s unemployment rate stands at 11.9 percent, according to the most recent data available from the state\u2019s Labor Department. Newark\u2019s and Paterson\u2019s jobless rates are bleaker, at 14.1 percent and 15.4 percent, respectively.\n\n \n\n But Jersey City -- the second most populous city in the state behind Newark -- has an unemployment rate of 10.2 percent.\n\n \n\n So, among that group of cities with a population of more than 100,000, Elizabeth is third, not last.\n\n \n\n City spokesman William Reyes said Bollwage meant to say Elizabeth has one of the lowest, not the lowest, unemployment rates among New Jersey\u2019s most populous cities.\n\n \n\n In his State of the City address, which Bollwage delivered before he gave the speech at the Cuban Club, the mayor got it right: \"Our unemployment rate is among the lowest of New Jersey\u2019s largest cities and we are looking to reduce that even more.\" A chart Reyes sent us that was shown during the mayor\u2019s address compared the unemployment rates in Elizabeth, Trenton, Newark, Paterson and Camden.\n\n \n\n Of those cities, Camden has the highest unemployment rate, at 18.8 percent, and Elizabeth had the lowest, at 11.9 percent. Jersey City wasn\u2019t included.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the unemployment rates in New Jersey\u2019s 15 most populous municipalities:\n\n*Sources: U.S. Census Bureau and New Jersey Labor Department\n\n\n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n The Elizabeth mayor said in an appearance at the Cuban Club that the city has the lowest unemployment rate among New Jersey\u2019s biggest cities.\n\n \n\n Among cities with populations of 100,000 or more, Jersey City has a lower unemployment rate than Elizabeth.\n\n \n\n A city spokesman said Bollwage meant to say Elizabeth had one of the lowest, not the lowest, jobless rates among the state\u2019s most populous cities -- a line he used in his State of the City address earlier this month.\n\n \n\n He may have got it right then, but he got it wrong this time around.\n\n \n\n We rate the statement False.\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "lang": "en"}
