It reflects an internationally embraced definition set by the International Labor Organization in 1982. For the record, the BLS also produces a broader unemployment rate, which includes people who work part time because they can\u2019t get a full-time job. That rate was 7.5 percent in July, compared with 9.4 percent when Trump took office (and 17.1 percent at its height under Obama).\n\nBut Trump repeatedly knocked the official unemployment rate as a \u201cphony number\u201d when he ran for president. He was not consistent in explaining what he considered the real number \u2014 his figures ranged from 18 to 42 percent \u2014 so here\u2019s what today\u2019s 3.9 percent rate would look like under Trump\u2019s campaign math.\n\nFor the lower figure, we will take the number of unemployed and then add people who work part time (either for economic reasons, such as slack business conditions, or for noneconomic reasons) and people marginally attached to the labor force (such as those who want to work but are discouraged). Then we measure that against the total size of the civilian workforce. That gives us a rate of nearly 21 percent.\n\nTrump\u2019s high-end figure of 42 percent was calculated by determining the percentage of the population that was not in the labor force (including retirees and students) as compared with the entire civilian non-institutional population. It was a crazy way to do it, but that was how Trump did his calculation.\n\nTrump, in a major speech, conjured up a \u201ca silent nation of jobless Americans\u201d using a particularly misleading statistic \u2014 people who are not in the labor force. More than 90 percent of these people do not want a job, because they are retired, in school, on disability or taking care of young children, according to a BLS analysis.\n\n\u201cNot in the labor force\u201d refers to people who are not looking for jobs because they have given up looking or are not interested \u2014 such as students. Students working part-time while going to school are counted in the \u201cemployed\u201d category.\n\nThat means Trump was counting students who are not looking for work as part of the \u201cunemployed\u201d population. Technically, those students don\u2019t have jobs. But that does not fit the definition of \u201cunemployed\u201d and is especially problematic for this age group, because the number of people who aren\u2019t looking for work includes people who are in school full time and may be doing extracurricular activities but have no interest in or need for a job.\n\nAt his rallies, Trump frequently brags that the unemployment rate for African Americans has hit an all-time low since it first was calculated starting in 1972. But by his own campaign math, the numbers turned worse under his watch: Black youth \u201cunemployment\u201d was 77 percent in 2017.\n\nHaving made so many inaccurate claims about the health of the economy under Obama, it is little wonder that Trump might believe he\u2019s performed an economic miracle now that he is relying on official government data. But as our exercise demonstrates, his record does poorly \u2014 or looks even worse \u2014 when the numbers are recalculated under his old campaign math.\n\nThe irony is that the generally rosy economic news under Obama was not felt evenly across the country \u2014 and thus Trump\u2019s campaign skepticism about the official numbers probably struck a chord with voters. Even after the sustained recovery from the Great Recession, a key employment metric \u2014 the employment-population ratio for people in the prime working years of 25 to 54 \u2014 still has not achieved parity with the level before that economic downturn. That suggests the economy is not operating at its full potential despite Trump\u2019s boosterism.", "lang": "en"}
