Gorsuch. He also noted a drop in illegal immigration at the southern border and \u201ca lot of activity that we\u2019ve been very proud to see in America manufacturing and job creation\u201d \u2014 claims we have fact-checked in the past.\n\nThere were 76 bills signed into law under Roosevelt in the first 100 days, compared with 28 (with a week to go) under Trump. \u201cThis is higher than any first-term 100 days since 1949 (55 bills signed), but less than all first terms from 1901-1949 except for 1909,\u201d said John Frendreis, a political science professor at Loyola University in Chicago who co-wrote a well-regarded study of legislative output in the first 100 days from 1897 to 1995.\n\nThirteen of the Trump bills disapprove of major regulations put in place by Obama, which signifies a reversal of action, not new action \u2014 though the agency is barred from ever repromulgating the rule in question or anything similar without congressional approval. Other bills include such actions \u2014 what Frendreis called \u201cminor or housekeeping bills\u201d \u2014 as naming a Veterans Affairs outpatient clinic in Pago Pago in American Samoa or creating a waiver to allow Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to be appointed even though he had recently served in the military.\n\n\u201cSome of FDR\u2019s initiatives were submitted to Congress in the morning and back on his desk that very same day for signatures,\u201d said Max J. Skidmore, a political science professor at the University of Missouri in Kansas City. \u201cHardly anything other than the most extreme of emergencies could bring that about.\u201d\n\n\u201cFDR\u2019s first session of Congress was a special session he himself had called,\u201d Brands said. \u201cHe also had the advantage of preparation, having been governor of New York for four years, three of them Depression years. So he knew what he wanted, what was popular and what might work. Trump is a novice.\u201d\n\nAs for executive actions, as of April 19 Trump had issued 24 executive orders, 22 presidential memorandums and 20 proclamations. One of his executive orders, imposing a travel ban from certain Muslim-majority countries, was a redo of an earlier executive order that had been blocked in the courts. But the new one has also been stymied by court challenges and thus has not been implemented.\n\nTo some extent, it\u2019s difficult to compare executive orders and memorandums among presidents, because only executive orders are numbered, but it\u2019s somewhat arbitrary how something is labeled. (We explored this at length in 2014.) In any case, Trump\u2019s first 90 days of executive actions do not stand out as especially unusual.\n\nAt this point, President George W. Bush was well ahead in ensuring passage of a major tax cut that he had pressed for in the election campaign. He proposed comprehensive tax legislation on Feb. 9, about three weeks after taking office, and a $1.35 trillion tax cut was passed by both houses of Congress by May 26, less than a month after Bush\u2019s first 100 days was completed. Trump has yet to release a tax plan \u2014 and his bid to repeal and replace Obama\u2019s signature health-care law was blocked in the House.\n\n\u201cTrump actually is unusual for his first 100 days, but for a reason opposite of what he said,\u201d said Skidmore, author of \u201cPresidential Performance: A Comprehensive Review.\u201d \u201cNot only has he accomplished almost nothing, but rather his initiatives (executive orders stayed by courts, a major legislative proposal failing even to come to a vote when his party controls both houses, etc.) have notoriously been unsuccessful.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s rather silly for any president to suggest that his first 100 days somehow topped Roosevelt\u2019s achievement. Lyndon B. Johnson, Ronald Reagan and Obama are credited with significant legislative achievements early in their first terms, but much of their success generally came after the first 100 days. Trump would be well advised to not make such a big deal about this because the available evidence shows that he in no way comes close to matching FDR\u2019s record.", "lang": "en"}
