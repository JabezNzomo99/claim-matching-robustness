We had noted before that the \u201clegal ramifications are in dispute\u201d about accepting help from a foreign government, so \u201cwe will leave that for the special counsel to sort out,\u201d especially whether it was a crime for someone in a campaign to accept a \u201canything of value\u201d from a foreign citizen. Now that Mueller\u2019s report is complete, we will review these claims in that context.\n\nThe other concerns the dissemination of hacked emails via WikiLeaks, but much of that section is redacted, so we will focus on the Trump Tower meeting. (At a rally in July 2016, Trump also expressed hope that Russia would find about 30,000 emails that Hillary Clinton had said she deleted because they were of a personal nature, and he asked people affiliated with the campaign to try to find them.)\n\nGiuliani, in a phone interview with The Fact Checker, pointed out that the Mueller report said the special counsel decided not to prosecute the Trump campaign officials in part because it could not determine whether the information had enough value (at least $25,000) to trigger a felony count, let alone the $2,000 threshold for any criminal charge. The initial email to Trump Jr. \u2014 and his response \u2014 suggested uncertainty about whether the material would be valuable, the report said.\n\n\u201cThese authorities would support the view that candidate-related opposition research given to a campaign for the purpose of influencing an election could constitute a contribution to which the foreign-source ban could apply,\u201d the report said. But it also said there had been no court ruling that established \u201cthe voluntary provision of uncompensated opposition research or similar information as a thing of value that could amount to a contribution under campaign-finance law.\u201d\n\nMueller also declined to prosecute because his team \u201cdid not obtain admissible evidence likely to meet the government\u2019s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that these individuals acted \u2018willfully,\u2019 i.e., with general knowledge of the illegality of their conduct.\u201d Trump Jr. did not consent to a voluntary interview, and Mueller concluded that the Trump White House\u2019s later efforts to prevent the email from becoming public \u201cmay reflect an intention to avoid political consequences rather than any prior knowledge of illegality.\u201d\n\nGiuliani noted that the Trump Tower meeting took place before it was publicly known that Russians had hacked the Democratic National Committee. So he argues that communication from Russia would not have raised any alarm bells among Trump campaign staff. Other experienced political operatives have said that any offer of help from a foreign government should have raised red flags.\n\nWe asked Giuliani about a famous case during the 2000 campaign \u2014 when someone associated with the George W. Bush campaign anonymously shipped a copy of a 120-page debate briefing book, along with a 60-minute videotape of mock debate sessions, to Tom Downey, then a congressman from Long Island who was assisting Al Gore with the debates and playing the role of Bush in mock debates. Downey immediately alerted the FBI; the person who leaked the debate prep materials was eventually charged and sentenced to a year in jail.\n\nIndeed, the report also strongly suggests that Trump himself was worried that he had committed a crime. The report says that the president\u2019s conduct, apparently aiming at undermining the Mueller investigation, reflected \u201cpotential uncertainty about whether certain events \u2014 such as advance notice of WikiLeaks\u2019 release of hacked information or the June 9, 2016, meeting between senior campaign officials and Russians \u2014 could be seen as criminal activity by the President, his campaign, or his family.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
