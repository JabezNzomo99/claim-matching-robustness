The post incorrectly claimed that Hoffman was sworn into office on a Dr. Seuss book, that she hated the Bible, and that she advocated for teaching kindergarten children about masturbation and sexual positions in schools:\n\nThis meme claims that Hoffman was sworn in on a Dr. Seuss book because she \u201chates the Bible so much.\u201d This claim is inaccurate, unfounded, and is based on the false assumption that lawmakers are legally required to be sworn in on a Bible.\n\nAlthough many public servants have chosen to swear their oaths of office on a Bible, this is in no way a legal requirement. In fact, people have been sworn into office using copies of the U.S. Constitution (in at least one case a digital copy), law books, various religious texts, and without any book at all. It\u2019s also worth nothing that the U.S. Constitution states that, \u201cNo religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.\u201d\n\nHoffman chose to be sworn in on a copy of \u201cToo Many Moose!\u201d, a children\u2019s book authored by Lisa M. Bakos, not Dr. Seuss. Hoffman said, \u201cThis has a lot of sentimental value to me because this is my students favorite book, this was [what] my students always wanted to read from.\u201d\n\nHoffman did not say that she chose this book because she \u201chates\u201d the Bible.\n\nThe social media post also claimed that Hoffman advocates teaching kindergarten students about \u201cmasturbation and sexual positions.\u201d This is also false.\n\nThis claim is based on a proposal crafted by Arizona State Sen. Martin Quezada, which Hoffman brought to to the State Board of Education in June 2019. The proposal sought changes to some of the language in Arizona\u2019s sex education policies. The proposal would have replaced language prohibiting the \u201cteaching of abnormal, deviate, or unusual sexual acts and practices\u201d with a statement saying that sexual education material should be \u201cmedically accurate.\u201d The Associated Press reported that the proposal would have also allowed schools to teach sex education to boys and girls at the same time.\n\nAll of the proposed changes can be seen here. The most relevant portions are shown below:\n\nThis proposal, which was ultimately rejected by the State Board of Education, made no mention of teaching sexual positions or masturbation to kindergartners. In fact, Arizona sex education policy explicitly states that the materials should be age appropriate. The aforementioned proposal made no changes to this age-appropriate policy.\n\nIt should also be noted that sex education is optional in Arizona schools and this proposal would not have changed that policy. In other words, Hoffman did not advocate to teach sexual positions and masturbation to kindergartners.", "lang": "en"}
