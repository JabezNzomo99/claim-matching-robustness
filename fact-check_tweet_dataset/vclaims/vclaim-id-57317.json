Russian media outlets identified the woman as a volunteer named Natalia.\n\nPutin recently announced that Russia had registered a COVID-19 vaccine after less than two months of human testing and without final trials being completed, according to USA TODAY. He added that one of his two adult daughters \u2013 Maria and Katerina \u2013 received the vaccine, though he did not specify which one, the outlet reported.\n\nThe image being shared shows a woman, purportedly Putin\u2019s daughter, wearing a face mask as she receives a COVID-19 vaccination as part of a trial. \u201c#MariyaPutin,\u201d the caption reads. \u201cThe first corona vaccine was applied to her body. She is the daughter of Russian President Putin.\u201d\n\nBut, contrary to the post\u2019s claim, the woman pictured is not Putin\u2019s daughter Maria. The Guardian and BBC News have published photos of Putin\u2019s daughters, and neither daughter bears resemblance to the woman depicted receiving the vaccine.

The same woman appears without a mask in a video published by the Russian Defense Ministry-run TV Zvezda, where she is identified as a cadet named Natalia. Other Russian media outlets also identified the woman as Natalia, according to AFP Fact Check.\n\nPutin said that his daughter received two doses and experienced mild side effects such as a fever, but is now \u201cfeeling well,\u201d The Associated Press reported.", "lang": "en"}
