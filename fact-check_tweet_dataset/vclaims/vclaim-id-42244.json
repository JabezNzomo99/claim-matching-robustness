A Facebook page named \u2018Indian Lok Sabha Election 2019\u2019 posted a photo, where the number of soldiers died under the 10 years of UPA Government and the 4 years of NDA government are compared. Let us try to analyze the claims of the post.\n\nClaim: Under the UPA government, in 10 years, 171 soldiers died but under the NDA\n\n government, in 4 years, 1250 soldiers died. Fact: A total of 1249 security personnel died under the UPA government in 10 years, in the state of Jammu Kashmir and the North-Eastern States, whereas a total of 378 security personnel died under the NDA government in 4 years. So, the number of security personnel killed under the NDA government is not greater than the number of security personnel killed under the UPA government.\n\nA comparison of the total number of deaths under the 10-year rule of the UPA government and the 4-year rule of the NDA government cannot be made. To get a better picture, it is wise to see the trend in the number of deaths in each year. The trend in the above graphs shows that there is a decreasing trend in the number of deaths from the year 2004 but during the last few years there is a slight upward trend.\n\nBottom-line: The numbers regarding the deaths of soldiers specified in the post are false.", "lang": "en"}
