No, that's not true: Gates has spent more than $300 million of his own fortune to encourage development of treatments and vaccines for the novel coronavirus, as well as efforts to slow the pandemic's spread, but there is no profit in it for the Microsoft co-founder. In fact, he and his wife, Melinda, have pledged to give almost all of their estimated $106 billion wealth to charity. ID2020, the entity that allegedly has a microchip plan for the world's population, does not have a microchip plan and is not owned by Gates.\n\nThese claims are among several conspiracy myths that villainize Gates, one of the world's most generous philanthropists, and are included in a post (archived here) shared on Facebook on April 9, 2020. It included a photo of Gates with Dr. Anthony Fauci, with the caption \"This picture should disturb you. If it doesn't you better wake up\" The text next to the image opened:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nThe full text of these posts read:\n\nHow are more Americans not completely outraged about what is going on in our country!? Does no one else find it weird that #BillGates - an unelected official, a computer guy with no medical degree, seems to be the world's leading health expert on the coronavirus, telling everyone what we need to do & when its safe to go back to normal? Its a little odd, that the same guy who led Event 201 just a few weeks before the first outbreak in China, where they had an exercise preparing & planning for a pandemic outbreak & can you guess what virus they chose for this \"hypothetical\" exercise? If you guessed the coronavirus you must be a psychic! This is the same guy that's going to profit the most from this virus with his vaccines he's pushing on everyone. I can guarantee you right now they will make this a seasonal virus just like the flu, so they can profit off the vaccines every year. In the past week, he's been making the media rounds on CNN & other shows saying we can all gather again once we've all been vaccinated! In another interview, he said that you will need to provide a vaccination certificate to work & travel. He also has a company called ID 2020 which will track everyone through microchips the size of a grain of rice that they inject into you with a needle. It will track everywhere you go & everything you do, but please don't take my word for it, google ID 2020. This is not the future, they have already done it in some countries & even some workplaces. Might I also add that this diabolical man is also THE largest donor of the World Health Organization? Think about that folks. THERE. IS. AN. AGENDA!!!\"\n\nThe statement that Gates is \"an unelected official, a computer guy with no medical degree\" is accurate. In fact, Gates is a college dropout. He attended Harvard University, but quit in 1975 to start Microsoft with childhood friend Paul Allen. In 2007, he got an honorary doctorate from the university. Gates, who has never served in or for the government, stepped down from day-to-day operations at Microsoft in 2008 and turned his attention to philanthropy, including funding vaccination research and other health concernss.\n\nNo, Gates does not hold a medical degree, but he does not hold himself out to be \"the world's leading health expert on the coronavirus.\" Instead, his foundation hires experts on viruses and funds grants for other others to conduct research and projects.\n\n\n\n Is he \"telling everyone what we need to do & when its safe to go back to normal\"? Yes, he does frequently offer his opinion on those topics. But since he is not a govenrment official, he has no power to force anyone to do anything and does not make a decision about when it is \"safe to go back to normal.\" Gates participated in a \"Ted Talk\" in March titled \"How we must respond to the coronavirus pandemic\": The \"Event 201\" reference in the post concerns a \"tabletop exercise\" on October 18, 2019, in which the John Hopkins Center for Health Security teamed up with the World Economic Forum and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. A website for the event described it as a \"global pandemic exercise\": The exercise illustrated areas where public/private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic in order to diminish large-scale economic and societal consequences. Lead Stories debunked any suspicion that the exercise was evidence that Gates was involved in a coronavirus plot.

There are many potential vaccines in development, with some already in human testing. Gates does not have a personal financial interest in any of them, although he has spent money paving the way for the production and distribution if one of the vaccines is proven safe and effective. The Wall Street Journal raised the question of Gates profiting from the pandemic in a May 11, 2020, profile titled Bill Gates Has Regrets: A spokeswoman for Mr. Gates said the couple have pledged to give most of their estimated $106 billion fortune to charity before they die or in their will. \"These conspiracy theories and misinformation are completely false,\" she said. The post's claim that coronavirus will become \"a seasonal virus just like the flu,\" could be true. Scientists and medical professionals, including Fauci, who is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have warned that the coronavirus could be The post's claim that coronavirus will become \"a seasonal virus just like the flu,\" could be true.Scientists and medical professionals, including Fauci, who is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have warned that the coronavirus could be seasonal and return, if it actually is vanquished in the first place, with a new wave in the fall. Others say the virus \"may never go away.\"\n\nTo claim that Gates will make COVID-19 seasonal \"so they can profit off the vaccines every year,\" relies on Gates having control of the novel coronavirus. There is no evidence that he, or anyone, can tell the virus if it should become seasonal. Also, there is no mechanism for Gates to profit personally from the virus or vaccine.\n\nThe post also claims that Gates has \"been making the media rounds on CNN & other shows saying we can all gather again once we've all been vaccinated!\" Again, while Gates predicted that mass gatherings will be risky until there is a vaccine, he has no power, beyond persuasion, to tell you when you can gather in large numbers again.\n\nThe same goes for the claim that Gates said \"you will need to provide a vaccination certificate to work & travel.\" While he may have suggested that as one approach, he has no power to create that requirement.", "lang": "en"}
