The tweet has been fabricated.\n\nThe image, which has been shared more than 121,000 times, shows a screen grab of an alleged tweet from Pelosi from December 2017, presumably referencing the tax reform bill President Donald Trump signed into law earlier that month. The alleged tweet was later deleted, according to text below the screen-grabbed tweet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disgusted with \u2018President\u2019 Trump allowing people to keep more of the money they earn,\u201d Pelosi purportedly tweeted. \u201cIt is this type of widespread theft of public resources that keeps America from being great \u2018Mr. President.'\u201d\n\nBut there is no record of Pelosi tweeting the statement. The Daily Caller News Foundation searched Pelosi\u2019s verified Twitter account and ProPublica\u2019s archive of her deleted tweets, but didn\u2019t find anything resembling the statement attributed to her in the Facebook post. An internet search also failed to turn up any evidence suggesting that the tweet is real.\n\nSocial media users often fabricate tweets from politicians using websites like TweetGen and the now-defunct Tweeterino. This particular fake tweet has circulated online since 2017 and has been previously debunked by fact-checkers.
