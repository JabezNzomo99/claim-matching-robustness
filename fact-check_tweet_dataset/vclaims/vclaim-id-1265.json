South Yorkshire Police confirmed to Reuters that the post is fake.\n\nThe post ( here ) is headed *POLICE BULLETIN*, with a South Yorkshire Police logo at the bottom. The main text reads: \u201cPeople are going door to door handing out masks, they say it\u2019s a new initiative from local government. They will always ask you to please put it on to see if it fits you. It has been doused with chemicals which knocks you out cold and once you\u2019re knocked out they proceed to rob you.\u201d\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police told Reuters that the warning is not legitimate and uses an old version of their logo. The new logo can be seen on their website www.southyorks.police.uk/ .\n\nRotherham South Neighbourhood Policing, which is in the South Yorkshire Police area, has also put out a warning ( here ) about the fake police bulletin: \u201cWe would like to reassure everyone that we have not received such reports. This post is fake and has included the logos of police forces nationally, including that of SYP.\u201d\n\nIn April, Reuters investigated fake posts worded almost exactly the same as this one but without the South Yorkshire Police logo. These had spread in at least three different countries, including the UK ( here ).\n\nFalse. South Yorkshire Police confirmed to Reuters that this warning is fake.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
