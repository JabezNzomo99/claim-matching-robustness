Theresa May was Home Secretary at the time, but the right to opt out of the measures was negotiated under a previous government.\n\nThe Treaty of Lisbon came into force in 2009 and intended to reform the European Union following its enlargement from 15 to 27 member countries. One element of the Treaty was that security and justice measures would no longer require the unanimous agreement of member countries.\n\nBut at the time the UK Labour government, along with Ireland, negotiated the ability to opt out of future security and justice laws on a case-by-case basis. In addition, they also negotiated the ability to opt out of all 130 pre-Lisbon security and justice laws, with the provision that they could opt back into some of them.\n\nIn July 2013 the Coalition government notified the EU that it would make use of the block opt-out option. It also decided to opt back into 35 measures that it felt remained in the national interest including, for example, the European Arrest Warrant.\n\nEU members had to agree unanimously on the UK\u2019s opting back into the 35 measures. So there were negotiations required, and they were successful from the UK\u2019s point of view.\n\nTheresa May was Home Secretary at the time, but it\u2019s difficult to say what her exact involvement in negotiations was.", "lang": "en"}
