One Twitter user, for instance, posted a video that supposedly showed the security/privacy issue:\n\nAnother person on Twitter also found that his phone\u2019s rear camera (the selfie lens) was opened when he browsed on the mobile app:\n\nSeveral tech websites have since picked up on these tweets and have published reports on these privacy concerns.\n\nHere\u2019s a run-down of the issue from CNET:\n\nWhen you\u2019re scrolling through Facebook\u2019s app, the social network could be using your camera, concerned users have found. Multiple people have found and reported that their iPhone cameras were turned on in the background while they were looking at their feed. The issue came to light through several posts on Twitter. Users noted that their cameras were activated behind Facebook\u2019s app as they were watching videos or looking at photos on the social network. After people clicked on the video to full screen, returning it back to normal would create a bug in which Facebook\u2019s mobile layout was slightly shifted to the right. With the open space on the left, you could now see the phone\u2019s camera activated in the background.\n\nGuy Rosen, the vice president of integrity at Facebook, confirmed on Nov. 12, 2019, that there was indeed a bug on some versions of the Facebook iOS app that was causing the camera to inadvertently open. Rosen said Facebook found no evidence that any videos or photographs were uploaded due to this bug and said the company had submitted a fix to the app store:\n\nWe recently discovered our iOS app incorrectly launched in landscape. In fixing that last week in v246 we inadvertently introduced a bug where the app partially navigates to the camera screen when a photo is tapped. We have no evidence of photos/videos uploaded due to this. We\u2019re submitting a fix for this to the App Store today.", "lang": "en"}
