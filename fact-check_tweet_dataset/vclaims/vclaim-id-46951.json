The post's caption read: \"Gisend ra ni sa akoa ha... Share lang nako kay para bibo\u2026.\" (This was just sent to me ha\u2026 Sharing to show I'm alert.)\n\nCompleting the list are various civil society groups like the Opus Dei, and several Filipino journalists, including Rappler CEO Maria Ressa. The article concluded that Brigadier General Edgardo Arevalo confirmed the ouster will be moved to December, in line with the failure of the communist rebels\u2019 \"Red October\" plan.

However, Department of National Defense (DND) Secretary Delfin Lorenzana and some of the persons named already dismissed the list as false. Two of the bishops included are also either retired or deceased.\n\nLorenzana, in response to Paolo's claim, confirmed to reporters on December 11 that there was no such destabilization plot. \"The first time I saw that posting, I said it's fake news. I still maintain that it's fake news,\" he said.

Drona retired from his post in January 2013, while Labayen died in April 2016, two months before President Rodrigo Duterte assumed office.\n\nPaolo, in response to reactions elicited by his claim, said he only posted the Excel file containing names supposedly involved in the alleged ouster plot \u201cfor fun,\u201d and that his critics should have read the caption of his post properly before getting angry.", "lang": "en"}
