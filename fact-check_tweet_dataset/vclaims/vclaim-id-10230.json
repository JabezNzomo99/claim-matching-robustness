That\u2019s an increase of \u00a35,375.\n\nThe increase means that this year taxpayers will not pay the basic 20% income tax rate on \u00a35,375 of their income which they would have in 2010/11. That equates to \u00a31,075 less tax.\n\nHowever \u00a36,475 in 2010/11 is worth around \u00a37,620 in 2018/19 terms when inflation is factored in. So the increase in the personal allowance is less, around \u00a34,230 in 2018/19 prices.\n\nThat means typical taxpayers will pay around \u00a3850 less in income tax in 2018/9 than in 2010/11, accounting for inflation.\n\nMost taxpayers are basic rate taxpayers as most earn under the \u00a346,351 threshold to qualify for the higher 40% tax rate.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that those paying less due to income tax changes are taking home more money overall. The Institute for Fiscal Studies found that when including changes to other taxes and benefits such as VAT and child tax credits, changes have led to \u201csignificant reductions in household income\u201d for low-income households between 2010 and 2015.", "lang": "en"}
