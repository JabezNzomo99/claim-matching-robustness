Soon after, his 10-minute speech was truncated to 11 seconds by many on social media and presented in a manner that Kumar came across as speaking on behalf of a political party. BJP IT Cell Head Amit Malviya had circulated the mischievously cropped video. However, he wasn\u2019t the only one. A Facebook page that goes by the name \u2018The India Eye\u2019 had also shared the video (which is now deleted), with the caption \u2013 \u201cWhich Party is Ravish Kumar talking about? A Freudian slip?\u201d\n\nIn the original video, Kumar is urging PM Modi to speak to his own party workers and tell them that people like Dadhichi are not true nationalists. This clip can be accessed here.\n\nA quick scroll through \u2018The India Eye\u2019 would divulge many more such misleading claims. The page has a following of over 17 lakhs and its posts are liked and shared by thousands on a daily basis. During the course of this article, we would investigate the origin of this page and present several other instances of its blatant propaganda.\n\n\u2018The India Eye\u2019 Facebook page had a phone number (8586993060) and its domain name (theindiaeye.com) provided in the \u2018About\u2019 section.\n\nAlt News searched for the phone number on Twitter and found that it was first posted from a handle \u2018HeMan NAMO\u2019 (@HemanNamo). In fact, HeMan Namo has promoted this number as \u2018The India Eye\u2019 Whatsapp number multiple times from his Twitter profile.\n\nWhile going through old tweets of HeMan Namo, we found an August 2012 tweet that included a Facebook link- \u2018fb.me/2hQEDGhIO\u2018.\n\nClicking on the link redirected us to \u2013 \u2018facebook.com/on.himanshujain/posts/274979465944900\u2032. This link was dysfunctional as the post was taken down but the URL implied that the name of the person running the Twitter handle @HemanNamo could be Himanshu Jain.\n\nSubsequently, we tried accessing the \u2018on.himanshujain\u2019 page by visiting the URL \u2013 \u2018facebook.com/on.himanshujain\u2019. But surprisingly, we were redirected to the Facebook page of \u2018The India Eye\u2019 instead. This suggested that \u2018facebook.com/on.himanshujain\u2019 was merged with \u2018The India Eye\u2019 page. To get a clearer picture of how we conclusively established the link step by step, watch the video below:\n\nAt this point in the investigation, we knew the name of the person (Himanshu Jain) and his Twitter handle (@HemanNamo). But we were yet to establish Jain\u2019s identity as his Twitter profile picture was that of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and not his own.\n\nThe default Twitter hashtag when a user changes their profile picture is #NewProfilePic, which made us look if Himanshu Jain had ever updated his profile picture with his own image. We found that in 2017 he had indeed used his photograph.\n\nWhen we reverse-searched this image, we landed up on the website of a company called \u2018Silver Touch Technologies Ltd.\u2019. Jain was described as the Whole-Time Director in the \u2018About\u2019 section of the website. Himanshu Jain\u2019s LinkedIn profile indicates that he is currently residing in Delhi and received his education from Ahmedabad.\n\nThe evidence till now showed that Himanshu Jain of Silver Touch was associated with \u2018The India Eye\u2019 Facebook page. However, it was not clear whether this association was in his personal capacity or there was any involvement of his company.\n\nAlt News wrote to Vipul Thakkar, the Managing Director of Silver Touch, and asked him if Silver touch is involved in the running of \u2018The India Eye\u2019. Thakkar emailed back to us stating, \u201cWe at Silver Touch are neither aware nor associated with any such Facebook page.\u201d\n\nWe also contacted Himanshu Jain and asked whim whether he was associated with \u2018The India Eye\u2019 Facebook page. Jain denied any links to the page.\n\nHowever, when we ran the domain name \u2018theindiaeye.com\u2019 through an online tool called myip.ms, we discovered that the website\u2019s IP Address \u2013 50.23.93.64 \u2013 is owned by Silver Touch. When we questioned Himanshu Jain about the same, he said that Silver Touch has several clients and it not possible for him to be aware of specific details of every customer. The IP Address of the website was changed soon after this conversation. The phone number originally listed on the \u2018About\u2019 section of \u2018The India Eye\u2019 Facebook page was also removed.\n\nFurther, the WHOIS results for the \u2018theindiaeye.com\u2019 domain name showed that it was using the name servers of Silver Touch.\n\nThe above screenshot also shows that \u2018theindiaeye.com\u2019 was created on June 24, 2016 at 12:16 UTC.\n\nOn another online tool domainbigdata.com, which keeps a historical data of whois information, we found that another domain name \u2018theindiaeye.in\u2019 was also created on June 24, 2016 at 12:16 UTC. This was registered under Himanshu Jain\u2019s name and his phone number (which is excluded from the screenshot below).\n\nThe Facebook page \u2018The India Eye\u2019 was previously called \u2018Changing India\u2019 and renamed on June 24, 2016. This coincides with the date of creation of both \u2018theindiaeye.com\u2019 and \u2018theindiaeye.in\u2019.\n\nIn conclusion, our investigation revealed that:\n\u2022 Himanshu Jain was associated with \u2018The India Eye\u2019 Facebook page. The domain names \u2018theindiaeye.com\u2019, listed on the Facebook page, and \u2018theindiaeye.in\u2019, registered to Himanshu Jain, were created at exactly the same time.\n\u2022 The IP Address of \u2018theindiaeye.com\u2019 domain name and the name servers used by the website were both owned by Silver Touch. This indicates that \u2018The India Eye\u2019 website was hosted on the company servers.\n\nSilver Touch Technology Ltd. is an IT firm that was established in Ahmedabad in 1992. In its \u2018About Us\u2019 section, the company defines itself as \u201ca leading and globally accepted IT Solution Provider and currently at the forefront of Digital Transformation & Emerging Technologies to serve the customers across the world.\u201d The company\u2019s website also has an \u2018E-Governance\u2019 section where it says \u2013 \u201cwe are serving citizens needs while working on government projects for more than two and a half decades. Our E-Governance service practices include a vast array of services.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Himanshu Jain tweeted about one such government project \u2013 the website of the Ministry of Culture, designed by Silver Touch and launched by BJP minister Shripad Nayak. The company has, in fact, done a lot of work for the BJP government. That same year, a mobile application for the President was developed by Silver Touch and inaugurated by Pranab Mukherjee at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Himanshu Jain was present at the occasion.\n\nThe Managing Director of Silver Touch Vipul Thakkar has also tweeted several times about projects undertaken by the company for various government departments.\n\nIn 2015, Silver Touch had developed the official mobile app of PM Modi. In 2013, it had launched a passport app for the Ministry of External Affairs under the then UPA government.\n\nLast year, NDTV had published a report titled \u201cExclusive: The \u201dSilver\u201d Touch Behind BJP\u2019s Online Dominance?\u201d. According to this article, the Gujarat government was among the biggest clients of Silver Touch. NDTV counted at least 17 departments that availed its services.\n\nNDTV had also found that Himanshu Jain, from his Twitter account @HemanNamo, was a part of trending pro-BJP hashtags. He is also followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Twitter. Last year, he made several tweets with #ModiTransformsIndia after the PM made a speech defending the economy. Another hashtag #LiesAgainstShah was tweeted several times by Jain after questions were raised on the finances of Amit Shah\u2019s son, Jay Shah.\n\nWhenquestioned in 2017, Jain claimed that his \u201cprivate\u201d social media activities had nothing to do with Silver Touch. However, Alt News\u2019 investigation suggested that Jain was the creator of the Facebook page \u2018The India Eye\u2019 and the website \u2018theindiaeye.com\u2019 was hosted on servers belonging to Silver Touch.\n\nIt is disconcerting that a Director of a multinational IT firm that manages several government projects is also linked to a propaganda website and Facebook page. \u2018The India Eye\u2019 has often been found circulating misinformation to its massive following of 17 lakh. Below are some of the instances that we found.\n\n1. Fake news about Sanskriti school bus attacked in Pune during Bharat bandh\n\nThe Congress Party announced Bharat bandh on September 10 as a response to rising fuel prices. Soon after, claims suggesting that a school bus was vandalised during the strike by members of the Opposition were widespread on social media. This narrative was propagated using a set of images that showed a damaged school bus of Sanskriti school with a shattered windshield. \u2018The India Eye\u2019 was among the many who circulated the claim, drawing a share count of 1,600.\n\nAs it turned out, the photographs of the damaged bus of Sanskriti school were misleading as they had been vandalised the previous day i.e. on September 9 and had nothing to do with the bandh. Alt News had busted the false claims here.\n\nOn September 15, \u2018The India Eye\u2019 shared a post claiming that \u201caccording to BBC, Congress stands at the 4th position among the top 10 most corrupt political parties in the world.\u201d This was shared 24,000 times and was liked over 17,000 times.\n\nA fake news website BBCNewsHub.com had published an article in July 2018, which was shared by \u2018The India Eye\u2019 as a recent and authenticate \u201clist of world\u2019s most corrupt political parties.\u201d Alt News debunked the false claims in this article.\n\n3. Fake news about Hardik Patel\u2019s weight gain while on a fast\n\nOn August 25, PAAS leader Hardik Patel had initiated an indefinite fast over demands of farm loan waiver and reservation for the Patidar community. The leader agreed to be hospitalized after his health deteriorated steadily on the 14th day of fasting. On September 4, 2018, reports emerged that the Patidar leader had lost 20 kg after 11 days of fasting and weighed 58.3 kg. However, a medical report published the next day showed a stark difference of 8 kg and put Patel\u2019s weight at 66.4 kg. This was taken as an opportunity for many to imply that Patel was not on a fast. \u2018The India Eye\u2019 post was shared 8,600 times and has now been deleted.\n\nHowever, a report by Desh Gujarat on September 5th clarified that the anomaly in weight was due to a false reading.\n\n4. Fake claim that Rahul Gandhi\u2019s Mansarovar yatra photo was lifted from Google images\n\nCongress President Rahul Gandhi had tweeted images of Lake Rakshastal during his Kailash Mansarovar yatra.\n\nSeveral right-wing users and pages quickly declared that Gandhi\u2019s pictures were lifted from Google stock images. \u2018The India Eye\u2019 also made the identical allegation, posing the question \u2013 \u201cWas it that Pappu ji went somewhere else in the name of yatra? (translated).\u201c\n\nAlt News had found that the image appeared on Google after it was cross-posted from Rahul Gandhi\u2019s Instagram to JD Social account. Essentially, it was posted by the Congress President himself on his social media account.\n\n5. Fake claim that Congress party used a mortuary van for political campaigning in Madhya Pradesh\n\nA photograph was shared widely on social media in August this year, which showed a Congress party advertisement on a van. Those who shared this image claimed that the van is a mortuary van, and ridiculed the Congress party for using it for its political campaign. \u2018The India Eye\u2019 post circulating the same narrative received over 3,200 shares. It has now been deleted and its archived version can be accessed here.\n\nAlt News had debunked this false claim using a simple Google reverse image search that revealed that the photograph was photoshopped.\n\n6. Fake claim that Sports Minister served food to Indian athletes at Asian Games\n\nAn image of Rajyavardhan Rathore holding a plate with food bowls and talking to athletes at the 2018 Asain Games was circulated as the Sports Minister serving food.\n\nAlt News had spoken to a person who was present at the scene. He informed that the picture was misleading as the minister was not serving food, snacks or tea but only greeting the players he met on his way to the table.\n\n7. Fake post claiming India took no loans from World bank during 2015 to 2017\n\nIn yet another instance, \u2018The India Eye\u2019 claimed \u2013 \u201cIn these 70 years of independence, there were only three years India did not take any loans from the World Bank \u2013 2015, 2016, 2017 \u2013 is this Modiji\u2019s failure or success? Namo namah (translated).\u201c\n\nAlt News had debunked this fake news in the past when we found that loans worth more than US$ 96,560 million for 50 projects had been approved for India during the time period in question.\n\nFrom the examples above, it is evident that the Facebook page \u2018The India Eye\u2019 is a repeat offender when it comes to misinformation. Their propaganda is apparent from the kind of posts they share \u2013 building the image of Prime Minister Modi and maligning Opposition parties. The use of well-designed posters with \u2018The India Eye\u2019 logo adds to their branding and easily catches the readers\u2019 attention. Its creation and marketing led by a Director of a multinational firm, while the firm itself providing web-hosting space to the site, is an unsettling truth.", "lang": "en"}
