We also noticed that the film posters hold no credits.\n\nAccording to IMDB, after \u2018Zero\u2019, SRK did a narration part in the TV series \u2018The Forgotten Army \u2013 For Independence\u2019 and gave his voice in \u2018Koochie Koochie Hota Hai\u2019. Apart from this, he will be seen doing a cameo in \u2018Rocketry: The Nambi Effect\u2019.\n\nWe then put the post through Reverse Search Image and found that the poster is actually created by a fan. We found the fan-based teaser on YouTube, dated September 20, 2018.\n\nThe trailer starts with a disclaimer saying that the video is only for entertainment purposes.\n\nThe above information proves that the actor is not doing any film based on the life of Tipu Sultan. Hence, the claim is false.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
