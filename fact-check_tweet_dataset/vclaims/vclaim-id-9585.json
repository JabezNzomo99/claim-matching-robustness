Those things would be determined by the attorney general within 120 days of the passage of the law, according to both the House and Senate bills.\n\nBoth versions also specify that any data collected from the tracking devices are only to be used to prevent injury or death, and the House version says that there is to be no federal database. The Senate judiciary committee report recommends that the attorney general bar the creation of a federal database.\n\nThe last action on the bill in either chamber before the 114th Congress expired was on Dec. 9, 2016. That means the bill must be reintroduced to be considered by the current Congress.\n\nRep. Christopher Smith, who sponsored the bill in the House, is planning to reintroduce it in the current session, according to his office.\n\nWhile this bill\u2019s purpose \u2014 funding research and implementation of programs to locate patients \u2014 wouldn\u2019t apply to most people, fears about microchip implants are nothing new. Back in 2010, we wrote about a false claim that the Affordable Care Act would require all patients to be implanted with microchips.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201cNow All Americans Will Be Microchipped On the Will Of Police: Resolution (H.R.4919) Passed by Senate.\u201d Viralnewsnetwork.net. 16 Oct 2017.\n\nBeers, Shaindel. \u201cThe House Just Passed A Bill That Violates All Your Rights.\u201d Change.org. 22 Dec 2016.\n\nU.S. Senate.
