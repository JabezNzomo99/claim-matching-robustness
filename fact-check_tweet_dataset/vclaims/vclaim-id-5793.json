The description of the article on the post is, \u201cThe English department at a public university declared that proper English grammar is racist and pledged to teach \u2018critical grammar.\u2019\u201d The claim is visible here .\n\nOn June 19, 2020 Rebecca Walkowitz, Chair of the English Department at Rutgers (here ), penned an open letter in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement amid a wave of national protests following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis ( archive.is/V3bgT ).\n\nThe letter expresses the Department\u2019s plans to respond to the calls of BLM to \u201ccreate and promote an anti-racist environment in our workplace, our classes, our department, our university, and our communities; and to contribute to the eradication of the violence and systemic inequities facing black, indigenous, and people of color members of our community.\u201d\n\nWithin the letter Walkowitz outlines a series of concrete steps to promote departmental changes, including expanding the availability of seminars engaging with discussions of social justice and improving graduate student life.\n\nThis same section also includes the letter\u2019s only mention of grammar, where Walkowitz talks about incorporating \u201ccritical grammar\u201d into the university\u2019s pedagogy. This approach, according to Walkowitz, is meant to \u201cchalleng[e] the familiar dogma that writing instruction should limit emphasis on grammar/sentence-level issues so as to not put students from multilingual, non-standard \u201cacademic\u201d English backgrounds at a disadvantage.\n\n\u201cInstead, it encourages students to develop a critical awareness of the variety of choices available to them w/ regard to micro-level issues in order to empower them and equip them to push against biases based on \u2018written\u2019 accents,\u201d the letter noted.\n\nThe open letter, however, does not refer to grammar as \u201cracist\u201d nor make similar statements. No other mention or discussion of grammar appears in the content of Walkowitz\u2019s statement.\n\nReached via email, Walkowitz told Reuters that the claim on social media is \u201cerroneous\u201d and misinterprets her message.\n\n\u201cVarious news outlets and social media sites have claimed that we are de-emphasizing the writing of clear, effective English and offering \u2018dumbed down\u2019 instruction for Black students. If that were true, I would be outraged,\u201d Walkowitz explained, \u201cBut that\u2019s not what we\u2019re doing at all. We\u2019re focusing more on grammar, not less.\u201d\n\nFalse. Rutgers University did not declare grammar \u201cracist\u201d. This is was the interpretation by the Free Beacon of a recent open letter published by the school\u2019s English department.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
