A transgender boy is born as a girl. A transgender girl is born as a boy.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that it is Cruz\u2019s opinion that transgender teenagers should be referred to by the gender that matches their chromosomes \u2014 even though this is not the norm with transgender labels. So when Cruz says \u201cteenage boys,\u201d he is talking about high school students who look, dress, identify and live as girls and are treated as girls by their families, classmates and administrators.\n\nAt question is Title IX \u2014 a federal civil rights law designed to prevent discrimination on the basis of gender in schools that receive federal funding \u2014 which is enforced by the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Civil Rights. Since 2014, there have been challenges to the Obama administration\u2019s interpretation and most have been unsuccessful.\n\nThe case that advocates and opponents are watching right now is that of Gavin Grimm, a 16-year-old who was born a girl and identifies as a boy. The teen used the boys\u2019 bathroom at a Virginia public high school for weeks, until parents heard about it and complained. The school board passed a rule to restrict students to use bathrooms that correspond with their \u201cbiological genders.\u201d Cruz\u2019s spokesman Brian Phillips said the candidate was referring to this case. (Note: In that case, Cruz incorrectly referred to it as a \u201cjunior high\u201d school.)\n\nGrimm and the ACLU appealed that decision, and a federal appeals court ordered a lower court to rehear the student\u2019s claims. The appeals court deferred to the Education Department\u2019s interpretation of Title IX. \u201cThe 4th Circuit is the highest court to weigh in on the question of whether bathroom restrictions constitute sex discrimination, and the decision could have widespread implications on how U.S. courts interpret the issue as civil rights activists and local politicians battle over bathrooms,\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Moriah Balingit wrote.\n\nIn one case, a Chicago high school district defied the Education Department\u2019s interpretation and decided to continue banning transgender students from using locker rooms for changing and showering in accordance with their gender identity. It was in response to a civil rights complaint by a transgender girl to use the girls\u2019 locker room. For the first time, the Education Department found a district in violation of Title IX based on transgender rights and threatened to pull federal funding. The district entered into a settlement and agreed to set up privacy curtains for any students who want them.\n\nCruz says schools are forced to allow teenage boys to shower with teenage girls. When referring to non-transgender students, this is a highly questionable assertion. School administrators from 10 states filed a brief in Grimm\u2019s case showing that schools have authority to take action if the law is abused by non-transgender students. The administrators said their schools have private bathrooms and showering and changing facilities for students who may feel uncomfortable. Even in the Illinois case, the school district was able to set up privacy curtains to protect any student who may feel uncomfortable in shared facilities. Advocates also note that so far, there haven\u2019t been problems with non-transgender boys or girls nefariously trying to use different bathrooms.\n\nThe DOE has no comprehensive guidelines to address every contingency, but there needs to be some confirmation that a student using the bathroom that is not aligned with their biological sex is, indeed, a transgender student, said Joshua Block, ACLU attorney representing Grimm. For example, some schools confirm the students\u2019 transgender identity based on pattern of behavior or a doctor confirmation.\n\nCruz says the Obama administration is forcing schools to adopt its transgender policies. It is clear that the Obama administration has been enforcing its interpretation of Title IX on school districts \u2013 as it is the department\u2019s job. The Department of Education has sided with the student in the Grimm case, which is still an ongoing legal case. If the transgender student wins the lawsuit in that case, it could have major implications for school districts in other states. To be clear, the Education Department is not suing any schools, and Cruz is incorrect on that point.\n\nWhen Cruz says teenage boys are forced to shower with teenage girls, he uses slippery language. He is referring to transgender girls (born as boys) showering with non-transgender girls (born as girls). The Obama administration\u2019s interpretation does support that: giving transgender boys and girls access to the bathrooms of the gender with which they identify. But this could also be interpreted by the public as if Cruz is referring to non-transgender boys showering with non-transgender girls.\n\nOpponents of the law say this is the danger of actions like that of the Obama administration. But even in schools that have to allow transgender students to use facilities that correspond with their gender identity, there are still opportunities for any students to maintain privacy by using a private facility or being separated by curtains.", "lang": "en"}
