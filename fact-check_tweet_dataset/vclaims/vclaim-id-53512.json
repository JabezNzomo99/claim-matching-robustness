In the play, we can see police officers requesting a Muslim man, who insists on visiting a mosque, to offer prayers at his home. The man doesn\u2019t listen to the police and starts to pray in public. That\u2019s when three men enacting the coronavirus enters the scene and infect the man. Subsequently, the Muslim man is taken by the medical staff and quarantined. The skit ends with a police officer instructing people to do puja or read namaz at home.\n\nThe message shared with the viral video suggests that Bhopal Police claimed that Muslims are responsible for the spreading COVID19. The viral text in Hindi reads, \u201cThis video is from Bhopal where the police created a play and blamed Muslims for spreading coronavirus.

The NGO is an initiative by Damodar Prasad Saw. While looking for clues on Twitter, Alt News came across Saw\u2019s tweets where he has posted multiple videos from the play. In one of the tweets, he wrote, \u201cOn the behalf of Shiksha Samadhan Trust, I\u2019m uploading all the proper videos that we performed with Katras Thana on 4-05-2020. Please don\u2019t be misled by haters. We are mainly spreading awareness of COVID-19.\u201d\n\nSaw tweeted the viral video on May 8 and wrote, \u201cPlease don\u2019t take in other ways. It was only a drama act for social awareness.\u201d\n\nWhile speaking with Alt News, Saw said, \u201cThe play was performed on May 4, around 4 pm, near Katras Police station. Since the lockdown, we have performed ten such plays in Dhanbad. The play\u2019s theme was Go Corona, it was divided into four parts \u2014 people visiting temples, people visiting mosques, people playing cards and people playing cricket.\u201d As per Saw, since the lockdown, the NGO has organised 8 to 10 such street plays. Saw added, \u201cUnlike other characters, the police officers in the play are also police in real life. We thought having police officers in the play would lift their moods and add a dash of realism in the play.\u201d\n\nOn May 11, Saw also posted a video statement on the NGO\u2019s Facebook page informing about the misleading narrative used to share the video.\n\nAlt News also spoke with Sanjeev Kant Mishra, Katras Police inspector. He said, \u201cThe NGO wanted to collaborate with the police to perform nukkad natak (street play) and spread the importance of social distancing.\u201d Mishra informed that no complaint has been registered yet against the misleading video.\n\nThus the two-minute clip from the street play is shared with a false and misleading narrative that Bhopal police organised a play to portray that Muslims are behind the spread of coronavirus, The play was organised by an NGO in Dhanbad and also featured temple-goers.\n\n[Update: An earlier version of the title of this report suggested that the play was organised in Bhopal. The same has been rectified.]", "lang": "en"}
