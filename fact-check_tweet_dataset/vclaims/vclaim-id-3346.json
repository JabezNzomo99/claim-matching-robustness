It appears that conditions are being created, and the appropriate information is being promoted for a possible U.S. withdrawal from this Treaty, as well, all the more so as Washington has already withdrawn from it de facto. The United States is trying to reproach and accuse us of something, but what exactly has it accomplished? It has deployed systems, allegedly ABM systems, in Romania.\u201d\n\nHe argued that it is easy to replace the defensive Aegis missiles, built originally to intercept a shipboard attack and now adapted for land use, with intermediate-range missiles. This would violate the INF treaty and, by implication, threaten Russia\u2019s security.\n\nUnder the Treaty, the United States and Russia are required \u201cto eliminate and permanently forswear\u201d nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles of specified ranges. Considered a major milestone in the international security framework that \u201creduced threats of surprise and preemptive attack,\u201d the INF provided for the destruction of some 2,692 intermediate-range nuclear-armed missiles. The destroyed systems reportedly included the Soviet SS-20, the American Pershing II, and an American ground-launched cruise missile.\n\nThe United States and Russia have accused each other of violating the treaty on multiple occasions. Besides the deployment of Aegis interceptors, Moscow points to the U.S. drone program as an example of the treaty violations and has on numerous occasions claimed that the United States has failed to present evidence and specific examples of Moscow\u2019s own violations.\n\nIn a series of latest declarations on the issue, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova made this statement a day prior to Putin\u2019s news conference: \u201cI would like to remind that the Americans do not present a single scrap of evidence for their allegations [against Russia]. They simply cannot present it because such evidence fundamentally does not exist.\u201d\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov similarly dismissed the allegations of violations, stating last March: \u201cThere have been no violations on our part. The U.S. claims otherwise, without providing any specific information that could be verified in order to clarify the situation.\u201d\n\nContrary to the statements by the high-ranking Russian officials, U.S. officials have not acted to leave the treaty, though some have called for withdrawal.\n\nMoreover, the United States has detailed the allegations of Russia\u2019s violations numerous times.\n\nAccording to the Arms Control Association, in 2014 the U.S. State Department alleged in a report Russia\u2019s violations of the treaty \u201cnot to possess, produce, or flight-test a ground-launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 km to 5,500 km, or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles.\u201d The department reportedly repeated its allegations in 2015, 2016, and 2017.\n\nIn 2015, U.S. Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Brian McKeon in his statement on the issue to the U.S. Congress stated that the evidence of Russia\u2019s violations was \u201cconclusive,\u201d adding that \u201cRussia has tested this ground-based system well into the ranges covered\u201d by the treaty.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about a real system and not a potential capability,\u201d he stressed, referring to a Russian cruise missile that U.S. officials dubbed the SSC-X-8. Russia tested it in 2014, and allegedly deployed one of the two missile battalions at a test site near Volgograd.\n\nSpeaking on Russia\u2019s alleged violations, NATO\u2019s Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Curtis M. Scaparrotti stated in March 2017 that \u201cRussia\u2019s fielding of a conventional/nuclear dual-capable system\u201d banned under the treaty \u201ccreates a mismatch in escalatory options with the West.\u201d\n\nHowever, in his July testimony, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Paul J. Selva stated that the Russian system, which allegedly violates the treaty, does not provide Russia with a special military advantage \u201cgiven the location of the specific missiles and deployment.\u201d\n\nThomas Karako, International Security Program and Director of the Missile Defense Project at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in 2014 that both the Russian and the U.S. press had provided reports covering Russia\u2019s alleged violations.\n\n\u201cOn the basis of extensive classified information and confirmation by the Departments of State and Defense, the House of Representatives in May declared Russia in \u2018material breach\u2019 of the treaty,\u201d he wrote, quoting former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Steven Pifer suggesting Russia\u2019s INF missile tests were part of a \u201cdisturbing pattern of disregard for international agreements.\u201d\n\nReferencing 2013 report by STRATCOM and the Joint Chiefs examining a U.S. \u201ccapability gap\u201d under the INF, Karako argues that Washington needs to consider its options if the treaty lapses in 2021 in order to address threats from intermediate-range systems of Iran, North Korea, and China, and Russia. Such options, he specified, include deployments of improved Army Tactical Missile Systems, Multiple Launch Rocket Systems, as well as the Vertical Launch Systems.\n\nOn the other hand, Russia accuses the United States of violating the treaty by deploying the Mark 41 Vertical Launch System, a component of a missile defense system capable of launching offensive missiles. Russia further alleges that the United States has relied on banned missiles in its missile defense tests while contending some of its armed drones represent banned cruise missiles.\n\nHowever, U.S. officials argue that the INF allows systems created only for intercepting \u201cobjects not located on the surface of the earth,\u201d such as the Aegis missile system.\n\nVladimir Leontiev, deputy head of the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s non-proliferation and arms control department, said in June that \u201cthreatening actions\u201d by the U.S. in the context of the INF treaty would lead to counter-measures by Russia to \u201crestore the military balance.\u201d\n\nA November article in the Arms Control Today quoted Putin as saying that Russia might be \u201ctempted\u201d to break the treaty if it did not have its air- and sea-based missiles matching U.S. capabilities. The INF, it notes, \u201cleft both countries free to deploy air- and sea-launched missiles\u201d with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers, a range the INF covers for the land-based missiles.\n\nThe article quotes Putin warning of an \u201cimmediate and reciprocal\u201d response if the United States withdraws from the treaty: \u201cYou can see how effective the Kalibr missiles are, from the Mediterranean Sea, from the Caspian Sea, from the air or from submarines, whatever you wish,\u201d he said. \u201cBesides Kalibr, with an operational range of 1,400 kilometers, we have other airborne missile systems, very powerful ones with an operational range of 4,500 kilometers.\u201d\n\nThe article notes that some Republican lawmakers, including Senator Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), reportedly advocate for the U.S. withdrawal from the treaty and that, according to U.S. officials, the United States provided \u201csome specifics\u201d of Russia\u2019s violations of the treaty in November 2016. This came weeks after Putin criticized Washington for \u201crefusing to specify\u201d its allegations.\n\nOn December 8, 2017, the U.S. Department of State issued a statement underscoring U.S. firm commitment to the INF Treaty but emphasizing that it seeks Russia\u2019s \u201creturn to compliance\u201d and that it \u201ccannot stand still\u201d while Russia develops systems that are violating the treaty.\n\n\u201cWhile the United States will continue to pursue a diplomatic solution, we are now pursuing economic and military measures intended to induce the Russian Federation to return to compliance. This includes a review of military concepts and options, including options for conventional, ground-launched, intermediate-range missile systems, which would enable the United States to defend ourselves and our allies, should the Russian Federation not return to compliance. This step will not violate our INF Treaty obligations,\u201d it said. It added that Washington is ready to stop its activities if Russia complies with the INF fully and verifiably.", "lang": "en"}
