The notice states that all 3rd-year undergraduate MBBS students and interns from government and private medical colleges in India shall be recruited for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWe fact-checked the above claim and found it to be fake.\n\nFirstly, we found no such notice on the official MCI website. We also googled the keywords from this news and found news reports on medical forums.\n\nOne such forum is Medicaldialogues.in, which is a medical and health news portal in India.\n\n An article in it states the content of the advisory as: \u201cBoard of Governors in Super-session of Medical Council of India has received several requests for seeking clarification regarding suspension of classes for undergraduate teaching. All Government/Private Medical Colleges are advised to strictly follow various advisories issued by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, State/UT Govts. and Universities regarding closure of educational institutions/suspension of classes and measures to be taken regarding preventive, quarantine, isolation, detection and treatment etc. for CoViD 19 cases,\u201d\n\nWe further looked through Twitter and found a tweet by the Press Information Bureau debunking the claim.\n\nHence the news is fake and the MCI has not issued any such advisory.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
