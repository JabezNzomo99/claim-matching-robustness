We gave Four Pinocchios to a similar claim by former House speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio). \u201cWe have literally filled up our jails with people who are nonviolent and frankly do not belong there,\u201d Boehner said in an April interview, referring to people \u201cwho are there for possession of small amounts of cannabis.\u201d\n\nNearly 44,700 people at the state level were serving a sentence of one year or longer at the end of 2015 after being convicted of drug possession as their most serious offense, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. This includes not only marijuana but also heroin, cocaine and other illicit drugs.\n\nAt the federal level, 47.5 percent of prisoners (81,900) were serving a sentence of any length at the end of September 2016 after being convicted of a drug offense as their most serious crime. But this includes not only possession, and not only marijuana, but all kinds of drugs and all kinds of drug offenses. \u201cMore than 99% of federal drug offenders are sentenced for trafficking,\u201d according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not even sure all drugs combined match those convicted of violent offenses,\u201d said Jonathan P. Caulkins, professor of public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. \u201cIt might. It\u2019d be in the ballpark. But most incarcerations where the controlling offense was a drug offense (vs. someone convicted of something serious also having a little possession offense in addition because they had personal consumption amounts on them when arrested for, say, burglary) are for cocaine/crack, heroin, and meth.\u201d\n\nWarren was speaking extemporaneously when she made this claim, responding to a question at the We the People summit, a gathering of liberal groups. A spokesman for Warren acknowledged her error in response to our questions. She meant to refer to marijuana possession arrests, not incarcerations, Warren spokesman Matt Cournoyer said.\n\n\u201cSenator Warren was referring to the number of people arrested, not incarcerated,\u201d Cournoyer said. \u201cShe was making the point that we need broad-based criminal justice reform because far too many Americans \u2014 disproportionately people of color \u2014 have their lives upended by arrests for low-level drug offenses.\u201d\n\nWarren has a point about marijuana arrests. Nearly 600,000 people a year are arrested for marijuana possession, according to estimates from Justice Department data. Studies show that African Americans are arrested for these offenses disproportionately, even though the rate of marijuana use is similar for whites.\n\n\u201cDespite shifting public opinion, in 2015, nearly half of all drug possession arrests (over 574,000) were for marijuana possession,\u201d according to a report by Human Rights Watch and the American Civil Liberties Union sent to us by Warren\u2019s staff. \u201cBy comparison, there were 505,681 arrests for violent crimes (which the FBI defines as murder, non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault). This means that police made more arrests for simple marijuana possession than for all violent crimes combined.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe arrest a lot of people for marijuana, but the system already knows not to put them in prison \u2014 or even in jail for very long \u2014 if their only offense is marijuana, unless it was a lot of marijuana [500-plus pounds] or they were on community release for a prior felony conviction\u201d e.g., convicted of robbery, given probation, then caught with marijuana while on probation and so have their probation revoked, Caulkins said.", "lang": "en"}
