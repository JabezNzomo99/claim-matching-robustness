Ford decided to expand in Michigan rather than in Mexico. But the decision has more to do with the company\u2019s long-term goal \u2014 particularly its plans to invest in electric vehicles \u2014 than with the administration. Here\u2019s what Ford chief executive Mark Fields said about the company\u2019s decision to abandon plans to open a factory in Mexico: \u201cThe reason that we are not building the new plant, the primary reason, is just demand has gone down for small cars.\u201d Read the full fact-check.\n\nFiat Chrysler. The company announced its plan to invest $1 billion in Michigan and Ohio plants and create 2,000 jobs. Sergio Marchionne, the Fiat Chrysler chief executive, said his company\u2019s plan to invest $1 billion for a factory in Michigan had been in the works for more than a year and had nothing to do with Trump. Marchionne credited instead talks with the United Auto Workers in 2015.\n\nGeneral Motors. The company plans to add or keep 7,000 jobs in the United States and invest $1 billion. Trump touted the decisions on Twitter, but a company spokeswoman said the decisions \u201chad been in the works for some time\u201d but that \u201cthe timing was good for us to share what we are doing.\u201d Just two weeks before GM\u2019s announcement, Trump had blasted the company on Twitter over its Mexican-made models of the Chevy Cruze.\n\nSoftBank. The Japanese company announced its $100 billion technology investment fund three weeks before the U.S. elections, when Trump faced a narrow path to victory. After a December 2016 meeting with President-elect Trump, SoftBank announced that $50 billion would go to the United States. But the United States outpaces all other countries in venture capital investments, and it is questionable that none of the $100 billion would have gone to the vibrant and promising tech industry in America \u2014 regardless of whether Trump was elected. Read the full fact-check.\n\nTrump has promised to create 10 million jobs over the next four years, and that ultimately is what he will be judged on. (We are tracking this promise and more on the Trump Promise Tracker.) All the job announcements in the world will mean little if actual hiring does not turn up in the monthly reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the meantime, he earns Four Pinocchios for his repeated, inaccurate claims of credit.", "lang": "en"}
