The rumor clearly had sticking power and regularly made the rounds on social media, and although aspects of it may be correct, the gist of the \u201cvaccination\u201d claim is easily disputed.\n\nHistorians at doll enthusiast site DollKind.com noted that Gruelle\u2019s purported creation of a \u201cdead\u201d and \u201clifeless\u201d tribute to his daughter with X marks over the doll\u2019s eyes were \u201cabsurd\u201d:\n\nRaggedy Ann has been historically associated with the anti-vaccination movement, and there is some truth and some fiction associated with this belief. The tragic truth that still wrenches our hearts to this day is that Johnny Gruelle\u2019s little daughter died after being given a mandatory smallpox vaccination at school. The child was just 13 years old, and her loss was devastating to Johnny Gruelle, who then became a proponent of the anti-vaccination movement. However, there is an absurd school of thought that asserts that the Raggedy Ann doll was created as a limp and lifeless-looking creature to symbolize Gruelle\u2019s dead child. This is certainly not the case, and Gruelle\u2019s registered patent of the Raggedy Ann character occurred right around the time of Marcella\u2019s death. Evidence indicates that he had been working on perfecting Raggedy Ann prior to this tragedy in his family.\n\nOn the Raggedy Land web site, author Patricia Hall noted that the legend was one of many associated with Raggedy Ann, a brand popular with children for several decades:\n\nJohnny Gruelle\u2019s little rag dolls have also found themselves at the center of several legend cycles \u2014 groups of stories that, while containing kernels of truth, are more myth than they are history. What makes this even more intriguing is that fact that Johnny Gruelle, either unwittingly or with the great sense of humor he was known for, initiated many of these legends, a number of which are continuously repeated as the factual history of Raggedy Ann and Andy.\n\nAccording to that site, plans for what would become an extremely popular rag doll were well underway when Marcella becae ill and died of an infection at the site of a previously administered vaccination:\n\nWhen the real-life Marcella Gruelle died, at age 13, from the ravages of an infected vaccination, her parents were, understandably devastated. Under different circumstances, this would have been a time of great rejoicing for Gruelle and his family. He was connecting with juvenile publishers, and was working on several sets of illustrated fairy stories. In November (the same month of Marcella\u2019s death) Gruelle had been granted final approval by the U.S. Patent office for his doll called \u201cRaggedy Ann.\u201d But all was overshadowed by the death of his beloved daughter.\n\nAs both doll historians stated, Marcella died not because of a vaccination, but possibly because of an infection related to the vaccination. Advances in medical sterilization and clinical protocols suggest a death like Marcella\u2019s would be highly implausible under typical circumstances more than a century later.\n\nAntibiotics and sterilization changed dramatically between the 20th and the 21st centuries. No honest comparison could be drawn between medicine in 1915 and 2017, as illustrated by Centers for Disease Control statistics (unrelated to vaccines):\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, for every 1000 live births, six to nine women in the United States died of pregnancy-related complications, and approximately 100 infants died before age 1 year (1,2). From 1915 through 1997, the infant mortality rate declined greater than 90% to 7.2 per 1000 live births, and from 1900 through 1997, the maternal mortality rate declined almost 99% to less than 0.1 reported death per 1000 live births (7.7 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1997). Environmental interventions, improvements in nutrition, advances in clinical medicine, improvements in access to health care, improvements in surveillance and monitoring of disease, increases in education levels, and improvements in standards of living contributed to this remarkable decline. Despite these improvements in maternal and infant mortality rates, significant disparities by race and ethnicity persist. This report summarizes trends in reducing infant and maternal mortality in the United States, factors contributing to these trends, challenges in reducing infant and maternal mortality, and provides suggestions for public health action for the 21st century.\n\nBoth Doll Kind and Hall\u2019s myths about Raggedy Ann\u2019s origins were well circulated, and Marcella\u2019s death is an integral part of the doll\u2019s apocrypha. However, Johnny Gruelle filed his patent for the dolls on 28 May 1915 and received it on 7 November 1915. Marcella coincidentally passed away on 8 November 1915, one day after her father\u2019s patent was granted.\n\nGiven that Gruelle filed the patent several months before his daughter died, it is impossible that he created the dolls as a response to his daughter\u2019s death. Raggedy Ann was in the works long before Marcella received any vaccinations, became ill, or died.", "lang": "en"}
