Similarly, Facebook user Patel Prasad posted the viral video with an identical claim. It gained over 26,000 views (archived link).\n\nAlt News performed a keyword search on Google and found that The News Minute (TNM) published a report debunking the claim that the incident was sparked by communal tensions. The report quotes Station House Officer (SHO) Moghalpura police confirming that the fight was not between two communities.\n\nAlt News contacted Moghalpura SHO who told us, \u201cThe video shows a tiff between two families. One of them had been celebrating Ganesh Chaturthi in front of other party\u2019s house since the last 40 years. However, due to COVID19, the family requested them to not celebrate the festival in front of their house. This resulted in the tiff. Both families are from the same community. There is no scope of communal angle.\u201d\n\nTelugu social media posts claimed that the idol was damaged in the fight. However, the policeman confirmed that it wasn\u2019t adding, \u201cthe dispute was settled between the elders and no FIR has been filed.\u201d\n\nOn August 25, Hyderabad\u2019s Commissioner of Police Anjani Kumar tweeted, \u201cWarning. A small quarrel which took place within same community in Moghalpura was settled by Police and community elders. Some mischief makers have uploaded a video and projected it as an intercommunity issue. Such trouble makers are warned not to indulge in these mischieves.\u201d\n\nThus, the social media claim that Muslims started a brawl after Hindu deity Ganesh\u2019s idol was installed in Hyderbad is false.", "lang": "en"}
