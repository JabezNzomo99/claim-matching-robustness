Cohen mentions that he had \u201cspoken to Allen Weisselberg [of the Trump Organization] about how to set the whole thing up\u201d and Trump asks, \u201cSo, what do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. No. What else?\u201d Trump said in response to questions about the Daniels payment, saying that he did not know about it when it was made and that he did not know where Cohen got the money. \u201cWell, you\u2019ll have to ask Michael Cohen. Michael is my attorney. And you\u2019ll have to ask Michael Cohen. \u2026 No, I don\u2019t know. No.\u201d\n\nTrump had no role in Trump Jr.\u2019s statement on Russia meeting\n\nMichael Flynn did not discuss sanctions with the Russians\n\nBut then on Feb. 9, The Post reported that Flynn had discussed sanctions in the phone calls. Flynn initially denied that he had discussed sanctions in an interview with The Post, but then amended his comment. He \u201cindicated that while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldn\u2019t be certain that the topic never came up.\u201d Flynn was fired within days.\n\nTrump then denied at a news conference that he had directed Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador and denied that other officials had been involved as well. \u201cI saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this, they know nothing, anything about it. They never received a phone call from Russia. It\u2019s all fake news. It\u2019s all fake news,\u201d he said.\n\nBut when Flynn pleaded guilty to misleading the FBI in December, the criminal information made it clear that other Trump transition team members were involved in the discussion about what to tell the Russians about the sanctions. The document described how Flynn discussed with another official what to say on the call, noting that Trump officials did not want Russia to escalate the situation, and that he then reported back to senior members of the transition team about the positive response from Russia.\n\nTrump did not give classified information to Russia", "lang": "en"}
