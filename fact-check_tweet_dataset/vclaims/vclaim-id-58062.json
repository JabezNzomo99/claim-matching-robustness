And one of his frequent lines is: ''The free market is . . . one of our greatest assets. And the leading Democratic candidate once said that the unfettered free market is the most destructive force in modern America. I mean, just get an idea of where the philosophy comes from.''\n\nExcept Clinton never called the free market ''destructive.'' Giuliani is blatantly \u2014 and repeatedly \u2014 misquoting a line from her 1996 book, It Takes a Village.\n\nIn the text, Clinton quotes author Alan Ehrenhalt, who wrote in his book The Lost City: ''The unfettered free market has been the most radically disruptive force in American life in the last generation.'' During a March 1996 interview on the C-SPAN program Book Notes, Clinton said she agreed with the statement.\n\nBut the word ''disruptive'' is not the same as ''destructive'' in the context of the free market, said Ehrenhalt, executive editor of Governing magazine. The magazine is published by CQ and is an affiliate of the St. Petersburg Times .\n\n\"There's no particular reason for a controversy,\" he said. \"But Giuliani is looking for anything to say against Hillary Clinton ... and he keeps distorting it.\"\n\nMost economists would agree, Ehrenhalt said, with his assertion that the free market causes interruptions, whether positive or negative, in its normal course \u2014 which is the dictionary definition of disruptive.\n\nA Giuliani campaign spokesman didn't see a difference between the words.\n\n''No one can deny that Mayor Giuliani was accurate in describing Hillary Clinton's economic philosophy,'' said spokesman Elliot Bundy.\n\nClinton's campaign didn't want to comment on the issue, but her full answer to the C-SPAN question provides more context. ''The market is the driving force behind our prosperity, our freedom ... (but) it cannot be permitted just to run roughshod over people's lives as well,'' she said.\n\nBecause of Giuliani's misquote, we give this a ruling of False.", "lang": "en"}
