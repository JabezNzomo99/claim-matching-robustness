(RELATED: Viral Image Claims Coronavirus Cannot Spread In Areas With Warm Climates)\n\nAmong other places where people typically gather, churches have been temporarily closed in Jerusalem due to lockdowns aimed at curbing the spread of the new coronavirus. The image shows a screen grab of writer David Videcette\u2018s tweet showing a video of the moment when the Church of the Holy Sepulchre allegedly closed its doors for the first time since 1349.\n\n\u201cThis is the moment The Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem was closed due to coronavirus,\u201d part of the tweet reads. \u201cLast time this happened was in 1349, during The Black Death, a bubonic plague epidemic.\u201d\n\nOn March 25, the church closed its doors indefinitely to comply with coronavirus lockdown measures in the city of Jerusalem. That closure does not mark the first time its doors have been shut to the public since 1349, however.\n\nThe Church of the Holy Sepulchre has actually closed on several occasions since 1349. Most recently, the church closed for three days over a tax dispute between church leaders and Israeli officials in 2018, according to Agence France-Press.\n\nVidecette later amended his statement in a subsequent tweet.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not to say it\u2019s never been closed,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIt was shut a number of times for very short periods in disputes or protests in 1990, 1999 & 2005. It closed during the 1967 war & there was a \u2018lock-in\u2019 over a tax dispute with the Israeli government in 2018.\u201d\n\nThe current closure represents the first time since 1349 that the church has closed for an extended period of time, according to Catholic Herald.", "lang": "en"}
