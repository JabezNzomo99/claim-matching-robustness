Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: 11 Indian Nuclear Scientists were mysteriously killed between 2009-2013, during the UPA government. Fact: In reply to a question asked in the Lok Sabha, Dr. Jitendra Singh has clarified in 2015, during the Modi Government\u2019s first term, that there is nothing \u2018mysterious\u2019 in the unnatural deaths of the 11 nuclear scientists. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched for information on the deaths of 11 Indian Nuclear Scientists, it was found that many newspapers published about the \u2018mysterious\u2019 deaths of 11 nuclear scientists in 2015. The news articles were based on the data released by Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), in 2015, that \u201811 nuclear scientists had unnatural deaths during 2009-13\u2019. But, on the DAE website, a Lok Sabha question and answer regarding this issue was found. In December 2015, in reply to a question about the \u2018mysterious\u2019 deaths of 11 nuclear scientists during 2009-13, Dr Jitendra Singh (Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions and Prime Minister\u2019s Office) answered that \u2018there were 11 unnatural deaths comprising 9 scientists and 2 research fellows of the Department of Atomic Energy during the period. All these cases of unnatural deaths were investigated by the Police andno case was categorized as \u2018mysterious\u2019.\u201d The reasons for each of their deaths can also be found in that reply\u2019s Annexure.\n\nTo sum it up, in 2015, during the Modi Government\u2019s first term, the government has clarified that there is nothing \u2018mysterious\u2019 in the unnatural deaths of 11 nuclear scientists and has also listed reasons for each of their deaths.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Indian Rivers?", "lang": "en"}
