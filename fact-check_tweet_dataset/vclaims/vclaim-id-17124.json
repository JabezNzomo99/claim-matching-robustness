She is not E. Jean Carroll, the writer who recently accused Trump of sexual assault, but is another woman who previously accused Trump of misconduct.\n\nThe writer E. Jean Carroll recently accused President Donald Trump of sexually assaulting her in the 1990s \u2014 an accusation Trump has rejected as \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Trump has denied knowing Carroll. \u201cI\u2019ve never met this person in my life,\u201d he said in a widely circulated statement. That is disputed by a photo of Trump and his then-wife, Ivana, greeting Carroll and her then-husband, John Johnson, at an NBC party in the 1980s.\n\nYet some social media users are circulating an image of Trump and a different woman to make the point that Trump has met Carroll.\n\n\u201cThe president stated he never met the latest victim of his, Jean Carroll. Never met her. Never touched her. Never talked to her. Never heard of her. Never mentioned how rich he was. Never raped her. Not once,\u201d the post reads. \u201cLying POS Rapist.\u201d\n\nThe photo included actually shows Trump with Jill Harth, who in the 1990s sued Trump, alleging harassment and attempted rape. Harth later withdrew the lawsuit after a settlement was reached in a contract dispute between Trump and Harth\u2019s then-fiance. The couple operated a beauty pageant with which Trump had partnered.\n\nHarth was one of several women who publicly accused Trump of inappropriate behavior during the 2016 election.\n\nHarth also recently weighed in on Carroll\u2019s story, writing on Twitter that \u201cwhat happened to her was almost verbatim to what happened to me at Mar A Lago in 1993.\u201d\n\nCarroll described Trump\u2019s alleged assault, which she says took place in fall 1995 or spring 1996 in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in New York City, in an upcoming book. An excerpt was published on a New York magazine website on June 21.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

But he\u2019s not alone on the list of awful men in my life.\u201d The Cut, New York Magazine. 21 Jun 2019.\n\nGraves, Lucia. \u201cJill Harth speaks out about alleged groping by Donald Trump.\u201d The Guardian. 8 Oct 2016.\n\nHarth, Jill (@jillharth). \u201cDeja Vu? Kudos to @ejeancarroll for coming forward with her account. Ironically, what happened to her was almost verbatim to what happened to me at Mar A Lago in 1993.\u201d Twitter. 21 Jun 2019.", "lang": "en"}
