But the only projection made that day was that the storm, then a Category 2, was moving in the direction of the Caribbean, and it was too early to tell where it would make landfall.\n\nThe National Weather Service's most recently issued hurricane and storm surge watches in portions of South Florida and the Florida Keys. Forecasters expect the storm to reach South Florida by Sept. 9. Florida Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency on Sept. 4.\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to tell where the storm is headed next, and the National Weather Service hasn\u2019t made any announcements on Irma\u2019s potential impact on New York or New Jersey or on its future wind speed, which determines its category.\n\nThe post appeared on the advertising-filled site NewsPunch.com, which contains a disclaimer saying the site owners \"make no representations about the suitability, reliability, availability, timeliness, and accuracy of the information.\"\n\nThis post was tagged under \"conspiracies,\" grouped with wild stories about the Illuminati and Earth\u2019s impending destruction.\n\nThe story\u2019s author did not respond to our requests for comment, but clarified he was not a weather expert in the post:\n\n\"As a layman, I know the models can turn out to be wrong. Sometimes even WAAAAAAAAAYYYY wrong. But if this model is right, then we in New Jersey (where I live) and folks in New York City, had better start preparing to EVACUATE within the next 7-8 days.\"\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
