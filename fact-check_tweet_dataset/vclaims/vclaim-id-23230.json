The clip doesn\u2019t prove that she is a \u201cfraud,\u201d as the headline of a story claims.\n\n\n\nE. Jean Carroll, a writer and advice columnist, is the most recent woman to accuse President Donald Trump of sexual misconduct. In an excerpt from her upcoming book published in New York magazine on June 21, Carroll described her recollection of how Trump raped her in a department store dressing room in the 1990s.\n\nThe president has denied the allegation, saying in an interview with The Hill: \u201cI\u2019ll say it with great respect: Number one, she\u2019s not my type. Number two, it never happened. It never happened, OK?\u201d\n\nNow his supporters have begun circulating a roughly 40-second clip from an episode of \u201cLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit\u201d in an apparent effort to discredit Carroll.\n\nThe clip shows a character mention role-playing rape at the same department store and one of the first Twitter accounts to share it said: \u201cBUSTED! Trump accuser E. Jean Carroll claimed she was raped in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room & said yesterday most women think of rape as a fantasy! Here\u2019s a clip from Law & Order of a rape fantasy in the dressing room of THE SAME STORE! What a coincidence! PROSECUTE HER!!\u201d\n\nShortly after the clip went up, the website of conservative commentator David Harris Jr. posted a story with this false headline: \u201cProof That Trump Accuser is a Fraud\u2026Story Came From Law and Order SVU.\u201d\n\nThe David Harris Jr. post doesn\u2019t actually offer any proof to back up the claim that the \u201cTrump accuser is a fraud.\u201d It cites only the clip and says: \u201cHer false Trump rape story that appears in her book came straight from an episode of Law and Order: Special Victims Unit \u2014 Episode 11, Season 13. Do you doubt it? The victim was raped in a Bergdorf Goodman, exactly where she said that her rape took place.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that the clip came from that episode of \u201cLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit,\u201d which originally aired in 2012. But it actually shows a character describing his various consensual role-playing encounters. This is the entire description he gave: \u201cRole-play took place in the dressing room of Bergdorf\u2019s. While she was trying on lingerie I would burst in.\u201d\n\nCarroll\u2019s account, however, is detailed over the course of about 1,800 words.\n\nThe popular conspiracy theory site InfoWars also published a story claiming, \u201cTrump rape accuser E. Jean Carroll\u2019s story mirrors almost exactly a plot line from an episode of Law & Order: SVU.\u201d\n\nThat story cites the clip, too, except the plot of the show centered on a rape that happened during a play, not the consensual role-playing mentioned by one character.\n\nOther versions of the clip have cropped up on Facebook and YouTube, and are accompanied by highly suggestive text that questions Carroll\u2019s allegation without explicitly labeling it false.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
