Trump even retweeted himself using the official presidential @POTUS Twitter account. In a news briefing, Spicer defended Trump\u2019s tweets, saying the president had a right to stand up for his family. Ivanka is being \u201cmaligned\u201d because Nordstrom has \u201ca problem with his policies,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just read your lousy review of Margaret\u2019s concert. I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that you are an \u2018eight ulcer man on four ulcer pay,'\u201d Truman wrote. \u201cSome day I hope to meet you. When that happens you\u2019ll need a new nose, a lot of beefsteak for black eyes, and perhaps a supporter below!\u201d\n\nIn a Nov. 21 internal email obtained by Fortune Magazine, the company\u2019s co-president, Pete Nordstrom, said the company planned to carry the brand as long as sales were profitable. He wrote that the company \u201cstrive[s] to be agnostic about politics and to treat all our customers with respect.\u201d The company confirmed the legitimacy of the email to the Fact Checker.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard from customers, including some who are long time loyal customers, threatening a boycott of Nordstrom if we continue to carry the line. Similarly, we\u2019ve heard from customers who say they will boycott Nordstrom if we stop carrying the brand. This is a sharply divisive subject. No matter what we do, we are going to end up disappointing some of our customers.\u201d \u201cEvery single brand we offer is evaluated on their results \u2014 if people don\u2019t buy it, we won\u2019t sell it,\u201d and the Ivanka Trump brand \u201chas grown to be a sizable and successful business.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo reiterate what we\u2019ve already shared when asked, we made this decision based on performance. Over the past year, and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn\u2019t make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now. We\u2019ve had a great relationship with the Ivanka Trump team. We\u2019ve had open conversations with them over the past year to share what we\u2019ve seen and Ivanka was personally informed of our decision in early January.\u201d\n\nIvanka Trump herself announced she would leave her eponymous brand, after her husband was appointed senior adviser to the White House. The Ivanka Trump brand did not respond to our inquiry, but issued a statement on Feb. 3 that read, in part: \u201cWe believe that the strength of a brand is measured not only by the profits it generates, but the integrity it maintains.\u201d\n\nThe Nov. 21 internal email shows the company faced threats of boycotts from both sides of the issue. Customers were sharply divided, the email said: Some wanted Nordstrom to continue selling Ivanka Trump apparel, others wanted the company to discontinue sales. Nordstrom told its employees it would be \u201cagnostic about politics and to treat all our customers with respect,\u201d and it anticipated that whatever decision it made would be based on sales, and would disappoint some of its customers.\n\nSomewhere between the end of November and end of January, the company decided it would no longer carry Ivanka Trump apparel next season. Based on the information at hand, Nordstrom consistently has said its decisions are made based on sales performance. It has not taken a stance for or against Trump\u2019s policies, the president\u2019s daughter or her brand. (For instance, an internal email on the immigration executive order took no specific stand.) The evidence is stacked against Trump and Spicer, and we award them Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
