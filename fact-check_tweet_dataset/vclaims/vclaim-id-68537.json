Nine in the back. Facts that the police and city officials tried to bury. Facts that Toni Preckwinkle brought to light,\" a narrator says in the 30-second spot. \"It was Toni who made sure Laquan McDonald\u2019s autopsy went public. Toni, who called for the dash cam footage to be released.\"\n\nMcDonald was shot and killed on Oct. 20, 2014, by then Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke, later convicted of second-degree murder and aggravated assault. But for more than a year after McDonald\u2019s death the city withheld video footage of the shooting and Van Dyke remained on the force.\n\nPreckwinkle\u2019s ad was quickly met with a flurry of criticism from both her opponents in the mayoral race as well as community activists. They accused her of politicizing McDonald\u2019s death and exaggerating her role in bringing the facts of the shooting to light for personal gain.\n\nWe wondered how much credit Preckwinkle could reasonably take for helping to make public two key pieces of evidence which contradicted the city\u2019s official narrative that Van Dyke shot McDonald in self-defense.\n\nThe first claim in Preckwinkle\u2019s ad checks out.\n\nPreckwinkle used her authority over the Cook County medical examiner\u2019s office to unearth the details of McDonald\u2019s death that were being kept under wraps. She first described the autopsy results to Jamie Kalven, an award-winning writer whose Invisible Institute has played a central role in investigating police abuse cases in Chicago. Kalven broke the story behind the McDonald shooting in February 2015, revealing that Van Dyke pumped 16 shots into McDonald and nine of those struck the teen in the back.\n\nKalven has recounted multiple times the story of Preckwinkle\u2019s assistance in helping him pry loose details of the McDonald autopsy.\n\n\"She agreed to see what she could find out and I was out for a run headed to Washington Park in the snow on a winter night in Chicago and Toni pulled up alongside me on 51st Street and gestured to me to get into her vehicle, which I did. She didn\u2019t say hello, she clearly was shaken. And she said, \u201816 shots \u2014 front and back,\u2019\" Kalven later recalled for WBEZ.\n\nHowever, we could find no evidence to support the second beat of Preckwinkle\u2019s TV ad claim \u2014 that she had pressured the city to make public the police dash cam video of the incident.\n\nThe Emanuel administration resisted release of the video for more than a year after the shooting even in the face of a lawsuit filed by independent journalist Brandon Smith. But on Nov. 19, 2015, Cook County Judge Franklin Valderrama ruled in Smith\u2019s favor and ordered the video\u2019s release, which came five days later.\n\nWe asked Preckwinkle\u2019s campaign for evidence that she had spoken up about the video prior to Valderrama\u2019s order. Spokeswoman Monica Trevino sent us several articles quoting Preckwinkle criticizing city officials for having delayed releasing the footage. But the articles all made clear that Preckwinkle weighed in only after the judge did and the video release was a fait accompli.\n\nWe also checked with Matt Topic, the government transparency and media lawyer who represented Smith in his suit. Topic also provides outside counsel to the Better Government Association, but the BGA, which operates PolitiFact Illinois, had no involvement in the legal case brought by Smith.\n\nTopic told us in an email he was not aware of Preckwinkle calling for the video\u2019s release ahead of the judge\u2019s order and said she filed nothing with the court to support Smith\u2019s position in the case.\n\nTopic was among those who called Preckwinkle out last week for inflating her role in bringing the true story of McDonald\u2019s death to light.\n\n\"Rather than use this any further for political purposes, I'd like to hear the candidates acknowledge that there is a serious ongoing secrecy problem requiring immediate attention on day one and their specific proposals and commitments on how they are going to address it,\" Topic wrote in a Twitter thread.\n\nPreckwinkle claims she was instrumental in releasing the details of McDonald\u2019s autopsy. That much is true.\n\nBut Preckwinkle\u2019s ad also asserts she called for the city to release the dash cam footage of the shooting. We could find no evidence of her doing so before a judge had already ordered the release.\n\nPreckwinkle\u2019s ad is partially accurate and leaves out important details, so we we rate it Half True.\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
