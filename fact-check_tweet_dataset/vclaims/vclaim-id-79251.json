The so-called excerpt describes an awkward moment between Pranab Mukherjee and Sonia Gandhi, alleging that Sonia Gandhi is used to subservience, is doing rounds on social media. Through this article lets fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Image of a purported excerpt from Pranab Mukherjee\u2019s book which reads that Sonia Gandhi took offence of his praise over Narendra Modi\u2019s one year tenure as PM. Fact: The book \u2018The Presidential Years\u2019 from which the purported excerpt is picked from is not yet released. According to news articles, Rupa Publications which acquired the rights of the book is planning to release the book later this year on Pranab Mukherjee\u2019s birth anniversary i.e. on 11 December 2020. With this, we can say that the excerpt in the post is a cooked-up story. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nThe purported excerpt in the post describes an incident which took place during Pranab Mukherjee\u2019s Presidential stint. Taking a cue from here, google search with the keywords \u2018Pranab Mukherjee\u2019s book on his Presidential tenure\u2019 led us to many news articles which carried news about this book. According to one such news article dated 01 September 2020, the book titled \u2018The Presidential Years\u2019 penned by Pranab which chronicles his journey as President of India is planned to be released later this year on Pranab\u2019s birth anniversary i.e. on 11 December 2020. With this, we can say that the book which talks about Pranab Mukherjee\u2019s Presidential years is not yet released and the purported excerpt from this book is a cooked-up story.\n\nFurther google search also led us to a tweet made in 2018 by Pranab Mukherjee pitching the idea of penning down his Presidential years.\n\nThe Same purported excerpt was debunked by a few fact-checking websites when it went viral back in 2018. These fact-check stories can be read here and here.\n\nMuch fake news revolving around Pranab Mukherjee started doing rounds on social media after Pranab Mukherjee\u2019s demise on 31 August 2020.\n\nTo sum it up, the excerpt in the post is a cooked-up story and the book which talks about Pranab Mukherjee\u2019s Presidential years is not yet released.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
