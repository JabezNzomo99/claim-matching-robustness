The claim is false; the photo of Khan has been doctored to make it appear as though Gandhi is sitting beside him.\n\nThe doctored image was shared in this Facebook post on May 2, 2019.\n\nThe Hindi language caption translates to English as: \u201cWho is this eating chicken biryani beside Miya Imran? Now the people will judge. This is Pappu's condition.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the doctored image:\n\nMiya is an honorific for Muslim males, while Rahul Gandhi is often referred to as \u201cPappu\u201d - which means \"fool\" or \"simpleton\" in Hindi - by supporters of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n\nHere is a report on Gandhi being called \"Pappu\".\n\nThe same doctored image was shared in a Facebook post here with an identical claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the photo of Khan has been doctored to make it appear as though Gandhi is sitting beside him.\n\nThe part of the image showing Rahul Gandhi has been digitally manipulated. AFP has circled where someone else's hand appears next to Gandhi's:\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the image was doctored from this photo, which was posted on Twitter on July 5, 2015.\n\nThe photo shows Khan dining with his then-wife Reham Khan. Below is a screenshot of that photo.\n\nThe couple divorced in October 2015 after ten months of marriage. Here is an October 30, 2015 article on their divorce published by the Guardian newspaper.\n\nThe day after the original photo was tweeted, the website of Pakistani TV channel Dunya posted this video.\n\nBelow is a screenshot from that video:\n\nThe photo of Rahul Gandhi has been doctored from this image of him opening a canteen in Bengaluru, India published by Indian newspaper The Hindu, on August 17, 2017.\n\nIn the photo, Gandhi is in the same pose as appears in the doctored image in the misleading Facebook posts.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo:\n\nAFP has previously debunked social media posts sharing the same image which had been doctored to show Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi eating with Imran Khan.\n\nThe exact same image has also previously been debunked by fact-checking organisation Fact Crescendo.", "lang": "en"}
