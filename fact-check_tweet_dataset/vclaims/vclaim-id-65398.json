And that requires more work.\"\n\nObama went on to say that \"since I came into office, just to give you some sense of perspective, we have increased the VA budget by 85 percent.\"\n\nEven over an eight-year presidential tenure, that sounded like a pretty big increase to us. So we decided to see if it was accurate.\n\nWe turned to VA budget data to see how large the increases have been. This chart summarizes what we found:\n\nThis chart shows that VA spending has certainly increased since 2008. But we've broken it down into two colors because it\u2019s important to distinguish between two types of funding.\n\nThe blue portion, known as discretionary spending, is funding that needs to be passed by Congress and signed by the president every year. The red portion, known as mandatory spending, includes funds allocated based on eligibility rules established long before the year when they\u2019re allocated. Examples of mandatory funds include payouts for disability claims, burials, pensions and education.\n\nThe White House confirmed that the 85 percent increase refers to the entire VA budget, including mandatory and discretionary spending. They said that the Obama administration did have an impact on the mandatory spending figure by enacting increased access to benefits, including expanding eligibility for benefits related to Agent Orange exposure.\n\nStill, a large reason for the growth in mandatory spending is that the United States has been engaged in fighting wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, thus creating more and more veterans who qualify for mandatory benefits.\n\nSo, to a great extent, mandatory spending is on autopilot when a president takes office, meaning that it\u2019s not obvious that Obama can take significant credit for increasing the mandatory portion of the spending bump on his watch.\n\nThe size of the increases\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that when Obama uses the 85 percent growth figure, he\u2019s choosing the largest of several figures he could have used. There are so many choices because comparing budget growth in the way Obama did is more complicated than it seems at first glance.\n\nFor starters, fiscal years -- the October-to-October time frames that are typically used in federal budgeting -- do not line up neatly with presidential terms, which always begin on January 20. So one could make an argument that the best base year to use in Obama\u2019s comparison could be either fiscal year 2008 or fiscal year 2009.\n\nAnd the end years are tricky, too. The most recent year for which final, solid dollar figures are available is 2015. For 2016, we only have projections.\n\nWe ran the numbers for each of the four possible time spans and found that the increase in overall spending ranged from 67 percent at the low end to 86 percent on the high end.\n\nSo Obama\u2019s 85 percent figure is cherry-picked, although even the worst calculation for Obama shows a 67 percent increase, which is still pretty substantial.\n\nRemember, however, that the president has the most influence -- along with Congress, with whom Obama had to agree -- on the discretionary portion of the VA budget. And the increases in discretionary spending were smaller.\n\nFor discretionary spending only, the same four possible calculations produce anything from a 36 percent increase to a 61 percent increase. That's a less impressive sounding claim -- at the low end, it\u2019s an increase of roughly 4 percent a year, rather than 10 percent a year, as Obama\u2019s original statement would suggest.\n\nThat said, Stan Collender, a budget specialist and executive vice president of the firm Qorvis MSLGROUP, cautioned that even an increase of 4 percent a year \"is nothing to sneeze at these days in federal budget land. I doubt many other parts of the discretionary budget had increases of that size, or at all.\"\n\nObama said, \"Since I came into office \u2026 we have increased the VA budget by 85 percent.\"\n\nObama has a point that the VA has seen significant percentage increases during his tenure, particularly for a period of budgetary belt-tightening elsewhere. However, it\u2019s a stretch for him to take credit for that, since so much of the increase stemmed from mandatory spending that originated with a continuing stream of veterans returning home and qualifying for benefits. Obama has also cherry-picked the highest numerical figure he could have.\n\nHis statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.", "lang": "en"}
