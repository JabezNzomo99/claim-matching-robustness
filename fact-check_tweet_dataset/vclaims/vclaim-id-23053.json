It\u2019s incorrect.\n\nWhen we asked the European Commission (the body that proposes the budget) their spokesperson said the EU has not said this, and that claims that the EU would collapse because of the financial implications of Brexit were exaggerated.\n\nThe claim may well originate in a 2017 Express article (which has a similarly worded headline) which reported on the fact that the EU would be left with a financial gap to fill.\n\nThat\u2019s because the UK is a net contributor to the EU budget, meaning it pays more into the budget than it receives back in the form of things like agricultural subsidies. The European Commission has also previously said that Brexit will leave a \u201csizeable gap\u201d in its budget.\n\nThe fact the EU has a budget gap to fill post-Brexit doesn\u2019t mean it will collapse.\n\nWhile the next EU budget for 2021-2027 hasn\u2019t been finalised, draft plans account for the UK leaving. The European Commission said:\n\n\u201cThe Commission\u2019s proposal takes fair account of the impact of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom, through a balanced combination of reductions/redeployments and an increase of expenditure (proportionally roughly 50% each).\u201d\n\nA Commission spokesperson told us the provisional deadline to sign off the budget is in autumn this year.", "lang": "en"}
