The claim is misleading; the video actually shows a giant python that had swallowed a wild boar in Indonesia; a woman was swallowed by a giant python in Indonesia but it happened in June 2018.\n\nThe 6-minute video has been viewed more than 1.3 million times since it was posted on Facebook here on November 25, 2019.\n\nThe footage was published with a Thai-language caption that claims the snake, which has a visibly bulged midsection, had swallowed a woman.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post's caption translated to English reads in part:\n\n\u201cOne of the most horrifying news stories that happened a few days ago is the story of an Indonesian woman being swallowed by a 7-metre long boa.\n\n\u201cAlthough this is a very rare event, it is considered to be the cause of human death. This is the second snake attack that has happened in Indonesia within a year.\u201d\n\nBut the claim is false; the snake seen in the video actually swallowed a wild boar.\n\nReverse image searches on Yandex using video screenshots, and keyword searches on Google, found the same video was uploaded to YouTube here on June 7, 2019, where it has been viewed more than 2.4 million times.\n\nThe video\u2019s Indonesian-language caption translated to English reads: \u201cMoment when a 7-metre long python bit a snake handler in Talo district of Seluma Regency - Bengkulu Province\u201d\n\n\u201cA 7-metre python was successfully caught by people of the Talo district of Seluma Regency, Bengkulu province. But unfortunately, the python that just swallowed a wild boar attacked its handler, leaving a bite wound on his right calf.\n\n\u201cLucky for him people who were watching helped the handler and they put the python in a box.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading post (L) and the YouTube video (R):\n\nAFP contacted the publisher of the YouTube video, Arya Gading, who confirmed that he had shot the video.\n\n\u201cIt is my video. I took it when I covered the incident in a village in Ilir Talo Ka district. You can check the publication date and who published it first,\u201d Gading told AFP on November 27, 2019, through Facebook direct message.\n\nGading also noted that the \"Arya Gading\" watermark visible in his YouTube video was blurred in the misleading Facebook post.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the blurred watermark (L) and the original watermark (R):\n\nTribunnews.com, a Jarkarta-based news outlet, also reported this story, which is topped with a screenshot of the video, on August 15, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the article:\n\nThe report's Indonesian-headline translated to English reads: \u201cSnake Handlers in Bengkulu Bitten by a 7-metre Python After Swallowing a Wild Boar\u201d.\n\nThe location of where the incident happened can be found here on Google Maps:\n\nThe misleading Facebook post is accurate to say that, although extremely rare, large snakes have killed and swallowed people in Indonesia.\n\nHere is an AFP report about a 54-year-old Indonesian woman who was swallowed by a giant python in June 2018.", "lang": "en"}
