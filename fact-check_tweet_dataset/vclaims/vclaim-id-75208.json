The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has made this claim in response to a petition by RSS-affiliated Muslim body Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM) against the practice of triple 'talaq'. The petition claims to have been signed by 10 lakh women. This claims deserves a fact check.\n\nFactCheck 2: So how did the 'abandoned girl' rescued from UP's Bahraich district become the 'Mowgli girl'. In a major embarassment for media houses across the board, it now turns out that the girl did not live with monkeys since her birth but displayed behaviourial inconsitencies due to slow development and speech issues. So how did the media get it so wrong? We do a fact check.\n\nFactCheck 3: Videos circulating on Facebook show Narendra Modi in 2014 heavily criticising the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for pushing through Aadhaar. In that video, Modi raised several questions regarding the expenditure incurred on the project and the concerns regarding misuse of the identification system by illegal immigrants especially in states having long and porous borders with neighboring countries. We do a fact check on what changed between then and now with the Modi government working on a fast pace to use Aadhaar across the board.", "lang": "en"}
