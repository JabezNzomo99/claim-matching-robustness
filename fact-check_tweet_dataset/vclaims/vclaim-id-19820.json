Don\u2019t fall for fake news, click here to check out The Quint\u2019s WebQoof stories. They say sharing is caring and a closed Facebook group by the same name seems to live the thought on a daily basis. The group asks for a government ID proof if you wish to join it and once you\u2019re inside the circle of over 18,000 individuals, you can buy or sell patriotism, misogyny, politics, Bollywood, nationalism and even God.\n\nEssentially, Sharing is Caring \u2013 Advertising Deals is a marketplace for social media pages. You can buy or sell Facebook, Twitter, Instagram pages, get paid for getting views on a video, offer to do SEO work for social media posts, rent pages and also create fake websites for potential buyers. The group\u2019s agenda is simple \u2013 get paid for sensationalism. Alt News tracked several topics that are most popular on the group: With the advent of the Internet, social media has become a money-making factory. Facebook is no longer limited to connecting with friends and playing Farmville but a place to easily connect with potential buyers. As more and more people get politically active on Facebook, a silent market emerged. Members of Sharing is Caring are not ignorant of the country\u2019s political winds and their deals are in tandem with the same. There are numerous individuals on the group selling pages dedicated to PM Modi, often charging hefty amounts. For instance, in the example below, one of its members is offering a page related to the Prime Minister for Rs 0.12 cost per like (CPL). He claims to have 3,86,000 followers, meaning that his \u201chell active\u201d page would fetch him Rs 46,320.\n\nIn a May 2017 article, we chronicled the activities of Pandey \u2013 how he made a mint in sleazy and pro-BJP websites that supplied regular content to Facebook pages. His website, InsistPost, isn\u2019t as active as it used to be but a Facebook page by the same name has quite a presence. Insist (the name of the page was changed to \u2018Insist\u2019 from \u2018Insist Post\u2019 in May 2018) has nearly 15.3 lakh followers. A scroll through the page shows that it regularly shares articles by numerous websites. All of these articles are either misogynistic, politically charged or related to God, among others. Pandey\u2019s social media profiles have several pictures of him posing with senior leaders of BJP like Amit Shah, Smriti Irani and BJP IT Cell head Amit Malviya. Ankit Pandey is a member of Sharing is Caring from two Facebook IDs (1 and 2).\n\nWe followed his conversations on the group and found him wanting to buy Facebook pages and websites. As Pandey is a recent member (from his personal IDs), there were only a couple of chats we could track. In an article published last year, Alt News revealed the workings of Rajesh Jindal \u2013 the man behind Hindutva.info. A Facebook event by Blog\u2019s creed stated that Jindal makes more than Rs 10 lakh per month. A scroll through Jindal\u2019s Facebook profile is enough to reveal his propaganda. Not only does he share posts praising the government, but his profile is filled with fake news. In one of his posts, he can also be seen speaking at an event by Swadeshi Jagaran Manch, which is affiliated to RSS. He had also posted a picture with BJP Haryana MLA Gian Chand Gupta. Rajesh Jindal has been a part of Sharing is Caring for six months now (at the time of writing this article). WebQoof: Videos of \u2018Earth\u2019s Crust Moving in Mongolia\u2019 Are Fake\n\nOne of the simplest ways to engage people is to stroke their beliefs and things they are most passionate about, which explains the numerous offers of Indian army pages. Members are not only buying and selling these pages but also offering them for rent. There are also rate cards mentioning the CPL of pages. The video below shows the popularity of Indian army pages on Sharing is Caring. One of the most trending topics on the group is \u201cgirls\u201d. Members of Sharing is Caring regularly make deals on pages that feature images of women, Instagram being a popular platform. What\u2019s even more astonishing is that pages are started with random names of girls and are sold once they get popular. We found a member selling a page named Neha Kumari. It has a following of over a lakh and all that the page does is share images of girls and women. Misogynistic content is a quick way to gain followers. Once this is achieved, pages are renamed and its content completely altered, though this may not be the norm. It has been observed that pages started with names of random women and actresses are metamorphosed into political pages. Alt News had in the past come across a Facebook page \u2018Rashmi Patel 1 Million Fan\u2019s\u2019 which is now called \u2018NAMO 2019 \u2013 We Support Narendra Modi\u2018. The page has over 4 lakh followers.\n\nBy this point in the article, Alt News was hitting random searches and we came across another popular topic \u2013 pages dedicated to God, devotion and religion. One of the members on the group was offering two pages with a combined following of nearly 7.5 lakh for Rs 1.5 lakh (in the collage below). One of the admins of the group offered a total of four pages (combined following of 5 million) and mentioned that the pages are a part of the same \u201cbrand\u201d. We have noticed the proclivity of individuals to open multiple Facebook pages in the past well. For instance, a member of another Facebook group \u2018Vote 4 BJP,\u2019 which has over 9 lakh members, urged people to follow another group called \u2013 \u201c100 crore rashtravadi Hindus ka group (add hote hi 50 Hindus ko add kare)\u201d. In merely 2 months, it has over 33,000 followers. This group is owned by the Facebook page \u2018Namo- Mission 2019\u2019, which was created in March 2018 and has already gained nearly 1.3 lakh followers.\n\nAlt News had recently published a story on fake government offers doing rounds on WhatsApp, claiming that the Prime Minister is giving away free helmets and bicycles. The message included a link that opened up a form, which asked for your personal details, including residential address. The one-page form had at least two Google ads. Last year, another WhatsApp forward claimed that PM Modi is giving free balance. This too redirected users to a form that asked for their name, phone number, mobile service operator and the state of residence. We found similar websites selling on Sharing is Caring. There were many others too offering websites with fake Paytm offers and Patanjali SIM cards. While at face value such websites might seem harmless, their repercussions could be massive. Recently, a fake poll doing rounds on Whatsapp asked for people\u2019s preference for Ram Mandir or Babri Masjid in Ayodhya. The communally-charged fake website only had a polling form adorning Google ads. When the desire to make money surpasses ethics, it gives birth to such provocative content. While reading through Facebook\u2019s terms and conditions, Alt News found that a Facebook employee explicitly mentions that buying and selling pages is against the website\u2019s policy. Members also seem to be aware of this regulation, as we inferred from a lot of conversations. Despite the violation, thousands of individuals on Sharing is Caring are making deals every day; and this is only one such group we have written about.", "lang": "en"}
