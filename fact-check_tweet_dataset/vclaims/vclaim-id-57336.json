Right-wing media and groups have continued to highlight alleged instances of voter fraud in numerous forms over the last few years, and regardless of the veracity behind their claims, this time was no different. U.S. President Donald Trump heavily criticized the use of mail-in ballots, arguing it would result in voter fraud.\n\nA similar claim emerged from a report that more than 19,000 fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses had been seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport from early 2020 until June 30. Conservative websites latched onto this story and shared the same post, arguing that the fraudulent licenses would be used to enable record numbers of illegally cast votes through mail-in ballots. One article on the conservative website of David Harris Jr., said:\n\nSnopes readers asked us to investigate claims that these fake driver\u2019s licenses could result in millions of illegally cast votes for Democrats in the November election. But the answer was not as obvious, nor as definitive, as these articles claimed.\n\nWere Thousands of Fake Licenses Actually Seized?\n\nThe airport\u2019s CBP confirmed that it seized a total of 19,888 counterfeit U.S. driver\u2019s licenses from the beginning of 2020 to June 30 in a Chicago airport. The majority of these shipments arrived from China and Hong Kong. The licenses were for various people in different states, and largely for college-aged students.\n\nSome licenses shared the same image, but with different biographical data. In a news release, the CBP said fraudulent documents like these often \u201clead to identity theft, worksite enforcement, critical infrastructure protection, fraud linked to immigration-related crimes.\u201d\n\nBut while reports of the fraudulent documents were accurate, a CBP spokesperson told Snopes that officials had \u201cno evidence\u201d that these fake IDs could be used by individuals to register to vote, and added they were \u201cnot able to speculate on this hypothetical situation.\u201d\n\nThe CBP was also concerned that bar codes \u2014 which contain a digital record of an individual\u2019s personal information \u2014 on fake Michigan IDs had been made in such a sophisticated manner that they could successfully pass through a scanner at an establishment such as a bar or restaurant.\n\nSnopes reached out to the Michigan secretary of state, which manages the voting process, regarding concerns over these IDs. Their spokesperson, Tracy Wimmer, highlighted that reproducing a real person\u2019s license, with the exact signature and bar code information was \u201cvirtually impossible,\u201d and voters were validated through many avenues, including contacting the department of state to verify photographs and the driver\u2019s license number. A voter\u2019s signature must also match the signature the government has on file when they apply for a ballot. Wimmer told us:\n\nShe added that they were not concerned about the possibility that such licenses could be used for voter fraud. We highlight the likelihood of such licenses making it through the registration process across the country in more detail in the next section.\n\nGiven that it is difficult to prove whether these falsified documents were intended to be used for a future event \u2014 the November election, for example \u2014 we assessed the likelihood that such documents could even pass muster in the voter-registration process.\n\nIn order to vote in the U.S. elections, all citizens have to register in every state \u2014 with the exception of North Dakota \u2014 with online registrations available in 39 states and the District of Columbia. According to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC), in order to register by mail, first-time voters have to present some form of ID, which could include driver\u2019s licenses, or paperwork proving their residence. Individuals registering online to vote may also need some form of state-issued ID.\n\nThe registration information is validated by the state by comparing information provided in the registration forms by each individual against the information provided when the individual received a driver\u2019s license or other state-issued ID. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL):\n\nA spokesperson for the National Association of Secretaries of States (NASS), a body comprised of secretaries of states who carry out election administration for different states, told Snopes that individuals attempting to vote using a fake driver\u2019s license or state ID would be flagged, since they wouldn\u2019t match the state\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) records.\n\nVoter ID laws vary by state, with a total of 36 states requesting or requiring some form of identification at the polls, 35 of which are applying these laws in 2020, with the exception of North Carolina. Other states use other methods at the polls, including most frequently verifying voters\u2019 signatures with ones they have on file. Many argue that these ID laws prevent in-person voter impersonation, even though examples of this kind of fraud are extremely rare.\n\nThus, it appears to be highly unlikely that the information on a fake license would match exactly with all the other information the government has on file for individuals.\n\nCan Fake Driver\u2019s Licenses Be Used in Mail-In Ballots?\n\nThe above claim posited that these fake licenses would result in millions of votes for Democrats through mail-in ballots, an argument that is both far-fetched and difficult to prove in advance of the election. Voting by mail and absentee ballots have stringent verification procedures that are similar to those used in the registration process.\n\nA NASS spokesperson told us that for mail voting, signature matches, driver\u2019s license numbers, and other identifiers must match with voter-registration records already on file. Security mechanisms also help prevent double-voting. For example, ballot envelopes are barcoded for individual voters, with election officials only accepting one ballot per voter.\n\nSnopes has previously covered how unlikely it is for fraud to occur through mail-in voting.\n\nHave Fake Licenses Actually Been Used By Voters?\n\nWe looked for past examples of fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses actually being used in the voting process and found a 2008 case from Colorado. We were not able to find examples of election officials being fooled by such licenses, however.\n\nDuring the 2008 presidential election, a small group of people provided fake license numbers, and officials found voter-registration forms signed by \u201cRip Van Winkle\u201d and other dubious applicants:\n\nIn summary, we were unable to determine if fake documents were intended to be used in a voter-fraud operation in the U.S., as some people claimed online. But given the security measures in place, and the lack of cases of such fraud occurring, it is highly unlikely that fake IDs could be used to plant false votes. That said, given how little we know definitively ahead of the election, we rate this claim as \u201cUnproven.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
