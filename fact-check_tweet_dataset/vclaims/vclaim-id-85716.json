We now have a list of 16 team members; one of the people whose background we had previously checked (FBI lawyer Lisa Page) has since left the team. So that\u2019s an additional nine names.\n\nAs we have noted before, federal regulations prohibit the Justice Department from considering the political affiliation or political contributions of career appointees, including those appointed to the Special Counsel\u2019s Office. So Mueller is legally prohibited from considering the political affiliations of the people he has hired. Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller, also has told Congress that it is not a disqualification for a lawyer in the Special Counsel\u2019s Office to have made a political donation.\n\nMueller, meanwhile, was a registered Republican when he was nominated to be FBI director in 2001, but is also considered apolitical. \u201cA Justice Department senior staff meeting went quiet this year when Mueller ran through a list of people he considered qualified for top temporary jobs, most of them Democrats,\u201d The Washington Post reported at the time. \u201cIt had never occurred to him that Democrats and the new Republican administration might not mesh.\u201d\n\nQuarles, who was an assistant prosecutor on the Watergate Special Prosecution Force, donated to the last four Democratic presidential nominees: $2,700 to Hillary Clinton in 2016, $4,600 to Barack Obama in 2007 and 2008, $1,500 to John F. Kerry in 2003 and 2004 and $500 to Al Gore in 1999. He donated at least $15,000 to various other Democratic campaigns, but also gave $2,500 in 2015 to then Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, and $250 to then-Sen. George Allen (R-Va.) in 2005.\n\nMeanwhile, Rhee, who had a top post in the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel under Obama, was an early donor to the Clinton and Obama campaigns and even maxxed out on her Clinton contributions. Rhee donated a total of $5,400 to Clinton\u2019s campaign in 2015 and 2016, and a total of $4,800 to a joint Obama-Democratic National Committee fund (Obama Victory Fund) in 2008 and 2011. She also made smaller donations to various Democrats and the DNC totaling $1,750. Rhee is part of the team listed as working on the George Papadopoulos case.\n\nAndrew Weissmann, described as Mueller\u2019s \u201clegal pit bull\u201d by the New York Times, served previously with Mueller, when he was general counsel of the FBI. He has also donated to Democrats \u2014 $2,300 to the Obama Victory Fund in 2008, $2,000 to the DNC in 2006 and $2,300 to the Clinton campaign in 2007.\n\nWeissmann, who is involved in the case against former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, has come under sustained attacks by Republicans after an email of his to then-acting attorney general Sally Yates was discovered. \u201cI am so proud and in awe. Thank you so much. All my deepest respects,\u201d he wrote on Jan. 30, 2017, after she instructed the Justice Department not to defend the travel ban in the courts. Trump fired Yates, but the version she refused to defend was blocked in court.\n\nGreg Andres, a former mob prosecutor who was a white-collar criminal defense attorney at the Davis Polk & Wardwell firm, is another veteran of the Obama Justice Department, where he headed the fraud unit from 2010 to 2012. He donated $2,700 to the campaign for Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) in 2017 and $1,000 to the unsuccessful Senate campaign of David Hoffman (D) in 2009. He is also part of the team on the Manafort case.", "lang": "en"}
