This needs context.\n\nThe RECOVERY trial -- the British government\u2019s program to test six treatment options to fight the coronavirus disease, including dexamethasone -- found the drug to be effective only on critically-ill COVID-19 patients that require ventilators and supplemental oxygen.\n\nThere was no observed benefit on patients who did not require respiratory support.\n\nThe preliminary results of the clinical trial, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, were announced by its chief investigators from the University of Oxford on June 16.\n\nThe limitation of the drug\u2019s effects as being beneficial only to severe COVID-19 cases was pointed out in Thoughtskoto\u2019s content, but its title misleadingly suggests the \u201ccheap\u201d drug will heal anybody with the disease: \u201cP3,150 Lamang ang Magagastos sa Gamot na Ito, Maisasalba ang Buhay mo Laban sa Corona Virus (You will only spend P3,150 on this medicine and your life will be saved from the coronavirus).\u201d\n\nThe caption used by the FB groups that shared the post -- 'nobody has to die anymore from COVID-19' -- is also misleading.\n\nThe research only demonstrated how dexamethasone reportedly cut COVID-19 deaths by one-third in ventilated patients and one-eighth in patients requiring oxygen alone.\n\nHealth Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire has warned the public on June 17 that dexamethasone was not a \u201cmagic pill\u201d against the coronavirus disease, after reports and online advertisements of the drug went viral on social media.\n\nShe said it \u201cis intended to be part of supportive care\u201d for critical COVID-19 patients and is neither \u201ca cure\u201d for the disease nor a \u201cprophylaxis\u201d that would prevent one from acquiring the virus.\n\nThe P3,150 amount that Thoughtskoto\u2019s article repeatedly brandishes seems to be rooted from a BBC article, parts of which were roughly translated by the Filipino website.\n\nAccording to Martin Landray, one of the study\u2019s lead investigators, the treatment involves 10 days of dexamethasone administration using the generic drug that costs about \u00a35, summing up to about \u00a350 per person. This converts to around P3,100 based on current exchange rates.\n\nFacebook groups DSWD & DOLE, DSWD 5K to 8K Financial Assistance / SAP, and Usapang SSS(OFFICIAL GROUP) were the top traffic generators of the Thoughtskoto article, which received 17,000 interactions in three days, and could have reached over seven million netizens on the platform, social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle shows.\n\nThoughtskoto was registered as a website on July 16, 2010.", "lang": "en"}
