She went public to specifically deny reports he had forced himself on her.\n\nMyra Belle \u201cSally\u201d Miller \u2014 the 1958 Miss Arkansas who said in 1992 that she had had an affair with Clinton in 1983. She claimed that she had been warned not to go public by a Democratic Party official: \u201cThey knew that I went jogging by myself and he couldn\u2019t guarantee what would happen to my pretty little legs.\u201d\n\nSome might argue that because Lewinsky and Gracen had relations when Clinton was in a position of executive authority, Clinton engaged in sexual harassment. Certainly an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claim could have been filed, though these women did not take that opportunity.\n\nPaula Jones \u2014 A former Arkansas state employee who alleged that in 1991 Clinton, while governor, propositioned her and exposed himself. She later filed a sexual harassment suit, and it was during a deposition in that suit that Clinton initially denied having sexual relations with Lewinsky. Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives over the matter, but acquitted in the Senate. Clinton in 1998 settled the suit for $850,000, with no apology or admission of guilt. All but $200,000 was directed to pay legal fees.\n\nJuanita Broaddrick \u2014 The nursing home administrator emerged after the impeachment trial to allege that 21 years earlier Clinton had raped her. Through an attorney, Clinton denied the claim, and there were inconsistencies in her story. However, several of her friends backed her claim. No charges were ever brought. (Here\u2019s a link to the Dateline NBC interview with her in 1999.)\n\nKathleen Willey \u2014 The former White House aide said Clinton groped her in his office in 1993, on the same day when her husband, facing embezzlement charges, died in an apparent suicide. (During a deposition in the Paula Jones matter, Willey initially said she had no recollection about whether Clinton kissed her and insisted he did not fondle her.) Clinton denied he assaulted her; an independent prosecutor concluded \u201cthere is insufficient evidence to prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that President Clinton\u2019s testimony regarding Kathleen Willey was false.\u201d\n\nPeter Baker, in \u201cThe Breach,\u201d the definitive account of the impeachment saga, reported that House investigators later found in the files of the independent prosecutor that Jones\u2019s lawyers had collected the names of 21 different women they suspected had had a sexual relationship with Clinton. Baker described the files as \u201cwild allegations, sometimes based on nothing more than hearsay claims of third-party witnesses.\u201d But there were some allegations (page 138) that suggested unwelcome advances:\n\n\u201cOne woman was alleged to have been asked by Clinton to give him oral sex in a car while he was the state attorney general (a claim she denied). A former Arkansas state employee said that during a presentation, then-Governor Clinton walked behind her and rubbed his pelvis up against her repeatedly. A woman identified as a third cousin of Clinton\u2019s supposedly told her drug counselor during treatment in Arkansas that she was abused by Clinton when she was baby-sitting at the Governor\u2019s Mansion in Little Rock.\u201d\n\nUpdate: We were focused on stories that emerged during Clinton\u2019s presidency. But many readers have also urged us to include a reference to Clinton\u2019s post-presidential travels on aircraft owned by convicted pedophile Jeffery Epstein. Gawker reported that flight logs show that Clinton, among others, traveled through Africa in 2002 on a jet with \u201can actress in softcore porn movies whose name appears in Epstein\u2019s address book under an entry for \u2018massages.\u2019\u201d Chauntae Davies, the actress, declined to discuss why she was on the flight. Clinton has not commented.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim is a bit too vague for a fact check. In any case, we imagine readers will have widely divergent reactions to this list of admitted affairs and unproven allegations of unwanted sexual encounters. But at least you now know the specific cases that Trump is referencing.", "lang": "en"}
