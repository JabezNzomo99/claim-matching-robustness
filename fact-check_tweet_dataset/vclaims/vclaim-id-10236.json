In 1996, the agency removed 45.\n\u2022 He claimed the EPA removed seven sites from the list \u201clast year.\u201d That\u2019s false. The agency removed three sites last year.\n\nPruitt did not specify if he was referring to calendar years or fiscal years, which run from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30. But either way, he\u2019s wrong. The above numbers are for calendar years. As for fiscal years, the EPA has removed 30 or more sites from the list in fiscal years 1996, 1997 and 2001, and the agency deleted two sites last fiscal year.\n\nPruitt made his claim in an interview on April 4 with the Washington Times (starts at about 13:30).\n\nHe also made the claim in an interview that same day on Fox News, while defending hiring Albert Kelly, a former banker, to lead the agency\u2019s Superfund Task Force (starts at about 15:30).\n\nFox News anchor Ed Henry first pointed out that Kelly was banned from the banking industry by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Though Kelly didn\u2019t plead guilty to any crimes, the FDIC did have \u201creason to believe [Kelly] violated a law or regulation,\u201d according to a May 9, 2017, settlement between the two parties.\n\nTwo weeks later the EPA announced Kelly would head the Superfund Task Force, which was created to \u201cprovide recommendations\u201d to \u201cstreamline and improve the Superfund program.\u201d The Superfund program manages the country\u2019s most contaminated sites.\n\nHenry then asked Pruitt what experience Kelly has related to running environmental programs. \u201cLook at the results that they\u2019re achieving,\u201d Pruitt responded. \u201cThat\u2019s the experience.\u201d\n\nPruitt added, \u201cWe\u2019ll have almost 30 sites off the list this year,\u201d which has \u201calmost never been done. Never been [done] in history.\u201d\n\nDuring the interview, Pruitt also confirmed that he has \u201chad accounts\u201d with SpiritBank, an Oklahoma bank where Kelly had been president and chief executive officer. Pruitt was the Oklahoma attorney general prior to becoming EPA administrator.\n\nWe reached out to Pruitt\u2019s office for comment multiple times, but it has yet to respond. We don\u2019t know how many sites will be deleted from the list this year. We also don\u2019t know if Pruitt was talking about fiscal years or calendar years. Either way, even if near 30 sites are deleted from the National Priorities List, it would be no record.\n\nIn fiscal year 1996 \u2014 which extended from Oct. 1, 1995, to Sept. 30, 1996 \u2014 34 sites were deleted from the list. In fiscal years 1997 and 2001, 32 and 30 sites, respectively, were removed. By calendar year, 45 sites were removed from the list in 1996.\n\nIn both interviews, Pruitt also touted that the EPA removed seven sites from the list \u201clast year.\u201d Again, it\u2019s unclear here whether Pruitt meant last calendar year or last fiscal year. But either way, it\u2019s wrong.\n\nIn calendar year 2017, three sites were deleted from the list. In fiscal year 2017, the EPA deleted two sites, both after he took the helm at the EPA in February 2017.\n\nThis would make it a below average year. Since 1983, when the list was created, the average number of sites deleted each fiscal year is about 11.3.\n\nThe EPA has deleted seven sites total since Pruitt took office. This would include four sites in calendar year 2018 (or five in fiscal year 2018) \u2014 sites that would presumably be included in his tally of about 30 for \u201cthis year.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that Pruitt\u2019s EPA can\u2019t take full credit for the sites it has deleted. All of them were first listed more than a decade prior to 2017. During this time, previous administrations did the work to remediate them.\n\nIn fact, all of the sites were \u201cReady for Reuse and Redevelopment\u201d in or before 2016. \u201cOnce sites have been cleaned up, EPA works with communities through an array of tools, partnerships, and activities to help to return these sites to productive uses,\u201d the EPA\u2019s website says.\n\nTwo regional EPA spokespeople told us that after a site reaches this stage in the cleanup process, the work that takes place entails monitoring contamination levels and compiling paperwork to delete the site from the National Priorities List. A site comes off the list when \u201call cleanup goals have been achieved\u201d and any comments from the public are addressed, the EPA says.", "lang": "en"}
