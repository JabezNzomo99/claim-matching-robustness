No, that's not true: the story was made up by a satirical website. It did not happen for real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by The Burrard Street Journal on July 11, 2018 titled \"Trump Invites Thai Boys To White House; Boys Request To Return To Cave\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nWASHINGTON, DC--The American President Donald Trump has had his offer to visit the White House rebuffed by the rescued Thai boys, who instead have voted unanimously to return to the watery cave. The cave which is now over 95% full of water has still been deemed more inviting than the White House especially to young children who would likely be seen as migrants and detained by ICE. \"They've been to hell and back and now you want to send them to another hell? No. These boys have been through enough,\" said the boys' soccer coach firmly.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nHowever the site carries following disclaimer so the story was not true at all:\n\nThe Burrard Street Journal Disclaimer\n\nIf you clicked here then you are probably doubting the legitimacy of one of our articles.
