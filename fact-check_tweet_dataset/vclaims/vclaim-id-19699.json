Garner supported Hillary Clinton for president in 2016. \n\n\n\nJennifer Garner was a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton for president in 2016 \u2014 she donated $74,900 to the effort to elect Clinton and participated in a rally about a month before Election Day.\n\nAfter Donald Trump won the election and took office, though, Garner said publicly that she would be willing to work with the new administration to improve education for poor children, an issue that she has worked on with Save the Children. During the first couple of months of the administration, Garner testified in front of a congressional subcommittee on the issue and told the Washington Post of Trump: \u201cIf he\u2019s willing to help the poor kids who got him elected, then let\u2019s do it. They certainly think he\u2019s going to.\u201d\n\nBut there is no evidence that she has said: \u201cI\u2019m Joining Trump Train Now.\u201d\n\nSince Trump took office, Garner has made two public appearances on \u201cThe Ellen Show\u201d and an appearance on ABC\u2018s \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d and she has addressed the National Governors Association. In none of those appearances did she say she was joining the \u201cTrump train.\u201d\n\nThe claim that she did was most recently posted on a website called NY Evening News. But several other dubious websites posted such stories in late 2017.\n\nAttempts to reach her publicist were unsuccessful, but if we do get a response, we\u2019ll update this story.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\nU.S. House of Representatives.
