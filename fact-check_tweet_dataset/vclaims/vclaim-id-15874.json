The post however presents pictures from a 2011 fashion spread of French girl model Thylane Blondeau, who was 10 at the time.\n\nThe post, archived here, started being shared and commented on recently, including in South Africa, after being posted more than one year ago. It reads: \u201cThe fact that little boys now do 'glamour shoots' for magazines dressed in ladies clothes is a damning indictment of just how far the West has fallen. This is the LGBT agenda in American [sic] and in our schools.\u201d\n\nSome commenters expressed outrage while others correctly identified the model as Blondeau. Some who recognised the original model expressed outrage at the presentation of a 10-year-old girl in a glamorous Vogue Paris photo shoot.\n\nThe original shoot led to a backlash -- not because people thought the model was a boy -- but because Blondeau was only 10 years old at the time.", "lang": "en"}
