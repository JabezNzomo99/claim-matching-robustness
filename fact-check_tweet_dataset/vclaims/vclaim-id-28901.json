The dish named Banana Nut Bread contains the combination of egg and banana apart from other ingredients.\n\nWe found during our investigation that a large coffee chain- Starbucks promotes its banana bread which is made with eggs and bananas.\n\nWe contacted Starbucks on the same and they said: \u201cWhatever products are made by Starbucks are verified as per international standards. We have not received any complaint on the product or any health issues after the consumption of this product.\u201c\n\nOne of the largest restaurant chains Denny\u2019s also serves a dish named Salted Caramel & Banana Cream Pancake Breakfast that contains the combination of bananas and eggs.\n\nWe also searched online reports whether there are any casualties reported due to the consumption of this combination of eggs and bananas.

She quoted:\n\n\u201cSuch an incident cannot happen on normal circumstances because both egg and banana are two naturally blessed foods that are covered and protected from contamination with natural means. People have to peel boiled egg and banana cover to eat and till its unpeeled, it does not get contaminated. Also, it is very easy to identify a rotten banana and egg as compare to other food.\n\nOther than that banana and egg are two wonderful sources of high-quality protein and carbohydrate. One serving of banana contains 110 calories, 30 grams of carbohydrate and 1 gram of protein. Also, bananas are naturally free of fat, cholesterol, and sodium and it provides a variety of vitamins and minerals like Vitamin B6. Similarly, one Hard-boiled egg provides only 77 calories, 5 grams of fat and a very small amount of carbs. They\u2019re also a very good source of lean protein, at about 6 grams per egg. Furthermore, eggs pack a complete range of amino acids, which means they are a complete protein source.\n\nThat is why sportsmen are highly recommended to have boiled eggs and bananas, every day and many world\u2019s famous sports personalities take hard boiled eggs and banana together in their breakfasts.\n\nOdd and rare cases where banana and egg can have its impacts on health:-\n\u2022 Patient of kidney dialysis: patients with extremely low kidney function can\u2019t get rid of mineral naturally through their urine they need mechanical dialysis machine to clean their blood. Such a patient can sometimes have a very high level of harmful potassium in their bloodstream if they have not done their timely dialysis. Then theoretically, banana and egg may further increase their body\u2019s potassium and mineral levels that may trigger a heart attack.\n\u2022 Bacterial contamination: while peeling the banana and egg if there is deadly bacteria contamination from the person\u2019s unwashed hand to the food. There are many deadly bacteria that can cause food poisoning.\u201d\n\nThe post claiming that a boy died after eating banana and egg together is fake.
