This infographic is misleading; it was not distributed by an official health authority and health experts say COVID-19 symptoms vary in duration and severity.\n\nThe infographic was published here on March 13, 2020 on a Facebook page called \u201cSystemhub Distribution Inc\u201d.\n\nThe post claims that COVID-19 symptoms last for nine days, starting with a fever and a mild sore throat, and ending with a \u201cmessy fever\u201d and difficulty breathing.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post, which has been shared more than 7,000 times:\n\nA similar infographic crediting \u201cSystemHUB\u201d was also shared in separate Facebook posts here and here.\n\nThe infographic is misleading; health experts say COVID-19 symptoms and the time of their onset vary, and warned against such self-check symptom lists.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of variability in the symptoms and in the length of time someone is sick,\u201d Dr. Edsel Maurice Salvana, an infectious diseases expert at the University of the Philippines' Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, told AFP in a Facebook message on March 19, 2020.\n\nSalvana added that following such misleading timelines may confuse people with flu symptoms and urged people to seek professional advice when unwell.\n\nInternational health authorities have also released information on coronavirus symptoms that is contrary to the timeline in the misleading posts.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states here that COVID-19 symptoms \u201cmay appear 2-14 days after exposure\u201d and that \"illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death\".\n\nThe World Health Organization also stated here that \u201csome people become infected but don\u2019t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, as of March 23, 2020, the number of COVID-19 deaths surged past 16,100, with over 361,500 infections reported globally, according to this AFP report.", "lang": "en"}
