While the government blames the online rumours for sparking riots and lynchings, the issue has also sowed wider political discord. AFP has looked at how the misinformation started and debunked some of the claims.\n\nNews outlets including AFP reported that the trouble began in December in Zambia\u2019s copper-belt region and more recently spread to the capital, Lusaka.\n\nCriminal gangs were using noxious gas to immobilise victims before robbing them, although official information about the incidents remained scant.\n\nTensions have escalated in recent weeks, with supporters of Zambia's two main parties hurling accusations at each other on social media. While some denounced the government for alleged inaction, others claimed it had actually orchestrated the gas attacks.\n\nAFP found dozens of Facebook posts shared more than 2,500 times which spread false or misleading claims about the attacks.\n\nWe've debunked some of these posts, which you can read here, here, here and here.\n\nAlmost all of them varied in content and claims, making it difficult to verify them collectively.\n\nThis post here, for instance, claimed to have identified the gaseous spray behind the multiple attacks, although AFP has yet to confirm it.\n\nAnother one here claimed the perpetrators were \"blood-sucking Malawian sorcerers\" hired by the ruling Patriotic Front to stay in power.\n\nA few, like this post here, alleged to show evidence of mob justice, although AFP has yet to confirm this with authorities.\n\nIn recent days, Zambia\u2019s two political rivals have called for calm and swift resolution - as well as taunted each other.\n\nPresident Edgar Lungu, in a statement released on February 19, appealed for cool heads from both his party and the opposition United Party for National Development (UPND), while expressing \u201cdismay\u201d at the spread of misinformation in media and on social networks.\n\nUPND leader Hakainde Hichilema responded a day later with a statement on his party\u2019s website, in which he denied allegations of complicity and suggested the real agents of disorder were within the ruling party\u2019s ranks.\n\nHe said the FBI or Britain's Scotland Yard should investigate the assaults.\n\nPolice on Friday said they had formally arrested 16 people.\n\n\u201cWe have further made progress to identify the persons who are behind this mob justice that has been going on,\u201d Rae Hamoonga, police deputy spokesman, said in a video here.\n\nOn February 17, Zambian police said in a statement they had apprehended 50 people in connection with various vigilante attacks in which at least five people had been killed.\n\nThe statement detailed numerous reports of suspects using poisonous gas, adding that those convicted face a prison term of 14 years.", "lang": "en"}
