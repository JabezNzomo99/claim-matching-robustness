No, that's not true: The Muslim population in the United States is predicted to be about 3,850,000 during the 2020 presidential race -- less than 1% of the total -- and should be about 6,610,00 during the 2040 race 20 years later, far fewer than the number necessary to elect an American president, according to a non-partisan, non-religion-affiliated study.\n\nA \"warning\" that the number of Muslim voters in the United States would reach a level high enough in 20 years \"to elect a president\" began circulating on social platforms in March 2019, usually in the form of memes, including a post (archived here) published on May 13, 2019. This meme, which included several spelling errors, read:\n\nIn twenty years there will be enough MUSLIM VOTERS in the Uinted STates to elect a President. Every American should be required to read this, but with the ACLU there is no way this will be widely publicized, unless we share this message. This is your chance to make to make a difference!\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nOther variations on the false claim include:\n\nAccording to a study by the Pew Research Center on population distribution of religions, out of a population of 310,380,000 people living in the United States in 2010, there were 243,0606,000 Christians and just 2,770,000 Muslims. The study projects the Christian population will grow by nearly 10 million -- to 252,870,000 -- by 2020, compared to a growth of just over 1 million Muslims -- to 3,850,000. The projection for the year 2040, which is the presidential election year relevant to the false meme, the Christian population is predicted to be about 8 million higher -- at 260,640,000, while the Muslim population in the United States is projected to have increased by almost 3 million -- to 6,610,000. With the US population projected to be 377 million in 2040, the percentage of Muslims will less than 2% of the total.\n\nThere is no math model that allows for just 2% of the population to elect a U.S. president. The American electoral college system does allow for a minority to elect a president, but it has to be far larger than 2%. One analysis suggests that the very lowest level is 23% of the popular vote, given a certain distribution of voters.\n\nThe Pew research does project that \"Christians will remain the largest religious group, but Islam will grow faster than any other major religion\" in the coming decades.\" The report says it current trends continue, by the year 2050:\n\nYou can read more about why the Muslim population is the world's fastest growing group in this Pew study.", "lang": "en"}
