Beginning on Nov. 20, admirers of Chapman and his late wife, Beth, who died in June after herself being the subject of death hoaxes, began posting tributes to him and sharing one of two blog posts.\n\nThe first purported to be hosted by a website with the domain name whatnow.actual-events.com, but when internet users clicked on the story on social media, they were redirected to the domain newspanel.suzeraincollections.com. There, the story carried the headline \u201cDuane \u2018Dog\u2019 Chapman Died of Pulmonary Embolism. He Didn\u2019t Survive His Second Attack. He Was 66 \u2014 WGN.\u201d\n\nThe highly dubious website falsely attributed the claim about Chapman\u2019s death to WGN America, a real U.S. television network that broadcast the Chapmans\u2019 most recent reality show \u201cDog\u2019s Most Wanted.\u201d The hoax article also misleadingly used WGN America\u2019s logo in a sharebait video that purported to be a television news report about Chapman\u2019s death, but that paused after a few seconds and required users to share the article on social media in order to continue watching:\n\nIn reality, WGN America had no connection to the story and did not report on Chapman\u2019s death in November 2019, because Chapman did not die in November 2019.\n\nThe specific claim that Chapman had died from a pulmonary embolism (a blocked artery in the lungs) was rather insidious. At first glance, it appeared especially plausible to many fans of the television star because he was in fact diagnosed with that very problem in September 2019.\n\nThe second blog post shared by social media users was even more distasteful than the first. It falsely and misleadingly used the logo of BBC News, a highly reputable and widely trusted information source, to report that Chapman had taken his own life.\n\nIn this instance, social media users shared an article that appeared to be hosted on the domain bbc-newsroom.actualeventstv.com, but which redirected to news-room.easystepsdiy.info. On social media, the post carried the headline \u201cDuane \u2018Dog\u2019 Chapman Died of Suicide After Depression Attack on His Sickness \u2014 BBC News\u201d but when users redirected to the source, the article\u2019s headline proclaimed:\n\n\u201cBreaking: (Actual Suicide Video) Duane \u2018Dog\u2019 Chapman Died of Suicide After Depression Attack on His Sickness \u2014 BBC News.\u201d\n\nDespite the extremely distasteful claim that the video in the article contained footage of Chapman\u2019s suicide, it contained nothing of the sort and, just as in the first article, the video stopped after a second or two and required viewers to share the post on social media in order to continue watching.\n\nThe claim that Chapman had taken his own life was, like the claim he had died of a pulmonary embolism, particularly insidious. In the season finale of \u201cDog\u2019s Most Wanted,\u201d broadcast by WGN America on Nov. 6, Chapman spoke about the recent death of his wife from cancer, and the considerable difficulty he was experiencing in coping with her loss.\n\nAt one moment in the episode, he reportedly discussed how he had contemplated taking his own life, such was his grief. People magazine quoted Chapman as saying:\n\n\u201cI just hope that I don\u2019t live very much longer without her, because now she made the first step, she\u2019s through the gate,\u201d he added. \u201cShe paved a way for me. I want to take a [god damn] pain pill so bad. I feel like if I did something to myself right now and passed away suicidal and I got to heaven and was like, \u2018Hi honey,\u2019 and would she go, \u2018You [dumb ass], why would you do that?\u2019 Or would she go, \u2018Wow, you\u2019re here.\u2019 I\u2019ll be like \u2018Of course I\u2019m here. You left me. I\u2019m here.\u2019 So, am I obligated to do that?\u201d\n\nBecause of that widely reported revelation, a report that Chapman had died by suicide would have appeared somewhat plausible to many readers.\n\nThe dubious nature of the websites involved, and the absence of any corroborating evidence or reports by actual news organizations, meant that some readers would have immediately recognized the stories as hoaxes. However, a significant number were taken in by them, and shared them on social media, to the extent that Chapman himself intervened.\n\nHe provided the gossip website TMZ a photograph of himself holding the Nov. 19 edition of the Denver Post, and a handwritten sign that read \u201cI\u2019m alive!\u201d Chapman then posted a screenshot of that article to his own Instagram page the next day.\n\nIf you need help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255.
