This article is a fact check of these claims.\n\nHas this government built India\u2019s longest Road Tunnel?\n\n The first claim is that India\u2019s longest road tunnel, \u2018the Chenani-Nashri tunnel in Jammu\u2019 has been constructed. The annual report of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (2017-18) states that, \u20182017 is the year when engineering marvels like the Dhola Sadiya Bridge in Assam and Chenani Nashri tunnel in Jammu and Kashmir were opened.\u2019\n\nAs per the annual report, this tunnel is not only India\u2019s longest highway tunnel but also Asia\u2019s longest bi-directional highway tunnel. It is built at an elevation of 1200 meters and cost Rs. 3,720 crores. The tunnel road is a part of the 286-kilometer-long project for four-laning of the Jammu and Srinagar National Highway.\n\nThis project was first approved in the year 2009 by the Public Private Partnership Appraisal Committee in the Ministry of Finance in its 28th meeting in October 2009. The approval can also be seen from this press release of the government. As per another press release of the government, the work on the tunnel started in May 2011.\n\nIn response to another question in the Rajya Sabha, the government stated that the physical progress of this tunnel road was 62.69% by August 2014. In other words, majority of the work was complete during the UPA regime.\n\nHave bridges been constructed at Baruch and Kota?\n\n The second claim is that bridges over Narmada at Bharuch and Chambal at Kota have been built. The annual report of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (2017-18) states that, \u2018a new four lane, extra-dosed bridge across river narmada at baruch, was inaugurated by the prime minister in March 2017, has brought relief for the people travelling on the vadidara-surat section of NH-8.\u2019 The 1.4 kilometre extra dosed cable stayed bridge is the second such bridge in the country and the longest. The report also states that \u2018a 6-lane cable stayed bridge across river Chambal at Kota was inaugurated by the Prime Minister in August 2017.\u2019 It was built at a cost of Rs. 278 crores and marks the completion of the east-west corridor.\n\nAs per this press release of the government in March 2017, the extra-dosed bridge across river Narmada at Baruch has been completed in 34 months at a cost of Rs 380 crores. According to this press release of the government in December 2013, the bridge over Narmada was approved during the UPA government.\n\nAs far as the bridge at Kota over Chambal river is concerned, this response of the then UPA government in the Lok Sabha in 2011 makes it clear that the project was approved in the year 2006 and that the under construction bridge collapsed when the progress was around 60% in the year 2009. It also goes onto say that modalities are being worked out for completion of the bridge keeping in view the findings of the committee of experts that investigated the cause of collapse, and, taking into account various issue on safety, durability and design aspects of the existing structure. The scheduled date of construction of this bridge was March 2010. The information on when the construction of this bridge resumed is not available. However, it is true that the bridge was inaugurated in 2017.\n\nHas this government constructed India\u2019s longest bridge?\n\n The last claim is that India\u2019s longest bridge, the 9.15kms long Dhola-Sadiya bridge over river Brahmaputra in Assam has been constructed leading to 24\u00d77 connectivity with Eastern Arunachal Pradesh. The annual report of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (2017-18) states that, \u2018India\u2019s longest bridge \u2013 the 9.15 kilometre long Bhupen Hazarika Setu Bridge (Dhola Sadiya Bridge) over river Brahmaputra in Assam was inaugurated in May 2017 and that this bridge has ensured 24\u00d77 connectivity between upper Assam and eastern parts of Arunachal Pradesh\u2019.\n\nIn the official documents of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region, the mention of this bridge was found as far as back in the year 2007. And as per government\u2019s response in the Rajya Sabha in April 2012, tenders were invited and the construction period was fixed as 4.5 years. Hence the bridge was approved and the construction began during the UPA.\n\nThis story is part of a larger series on the 4-years of the Modi government.
