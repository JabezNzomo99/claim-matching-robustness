The agitation began on December 15, 2019, after Delhi Police cracked down on Jamia Millia Islamia students who were opposing the new citizenship law. Led by mostly Muslim women, it is the longest ongoing continuous protest against the CAA. The same image was sent to BOOM's WhatsApp helpline number (7700906111) for verification.\n\n\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search and found that the original image had no such text which implied that protesters were bribed for showing solidarity to the anti-CAA demonstrations. In the original image, the text in the banner reads, \"CAA and NRC should be withdrawn\" (Original text in Hindi: CAA \u0935\u093e\u092a\u0938 \u0932\u094b NRC \u0935\u093e\u092a\u0938 \u0932\u094b) The photograph was taken at the ongoing protests of Shaheen Bagh on January 7, 2020. The image was published on Huffington Post India and was originally clicked by AFP's Money Sharma for Getty Images.\n\nAlso Read: Is This A Video Of Vajpayee's Niece Slamming The Government On CAA?
