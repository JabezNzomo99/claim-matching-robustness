If you don\u2019t, you have to pay a penalty or take a waiver. More people, almost twice as many, pay the penalty or take the waiver than signed up for it.\"\n\nMcCarthy is correct that Obamacare requires people to have health insurance, unless they pay a penalty or claim an exemption.\n\nBut we wanted to know: Have almost twice as many people really declined health coverage -- by paying the penalty or taking a waiver -- as signed up for Obamacare?\n\nAnd what counts for a \u2018sign-up\u2019 under Obamacare?\n\nWe set out on a fact check.\n\nWe asked McCarthy\u2019s spokesman for evidence supporting the claim. For the penalty and exemptions, he cited figures from an IRS report to Congress based on tax year 2015, the latest year for which numbers are available.\n\nAltogether, 19.2 million declined Obamacare coverage that year. These figures are widely accepted by health policy experts.\n\nFor Obamacare sign-ups, McCarthy\u2019s spokesman cited a 12.2 million figure for the most recent enrollment period. It\u2019s based on a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services news release, though health policy experts say it\u2019s far from the full picture on Obamacare sign-ups. It shows the number who selected or were automatically re-enrolled in an Obamacare marketplace plan nationally.\n\nLooking at the numbers, 19.2 million is not \"almost twice as many\" as 12.2 million.\n\nThere\u2019s also the larger question: Are the marketplaces the full picture of Obamacare sign-ups?\n\nPresident Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in 2010. The federal law, however, did not go into effect until 2014.\n\nWhen it did, it created two ways to increase the number of people with health insurance in the United States -- the exchanges and an expanded Medicaid program -- said Gerald Kominski, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research.\n\nTotal sign-ups under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s are closer to 20 million when adding enrollment through the exchanges and Medicaid expansion, Kominski said. That figure comes from a March 2016 report by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\"It\u2019s a false statement,\" Kominski said of McCarthy\u2019s claim. \"The category that the congressman conveniently left out of his narrative (is) the roughly 14 million people who were newly enrolled in Medicaid programs around the country. It\u2019s the missing piece.\"\n\n\"To ignore one category and exclusively focus on the other is disingenuous,\" he added. \"Either that or it shows a fundamental lack of (understanding) of the law.\"\n\nKominski advocates for the Affordable Care Act as \"a great step forward\" on his website.\n\nJoy Melnikow, Director of the UC Davis Center for Healthcare Policy and Research, agreed Medicaid can\u2019t be ignored.\n\n\"It\u2019s certainly part of Obamacare,\" Melnikow said. \"It was the bigger piece of what Obamacare did.\"\n\nThe two main parts of Obamacare, the marketplaces and Medicaid, are more connected than some might think, she added.\n\n\"When someone goes to buy insurance on the exchange, the process solicits information about that individual\u2019s income to see if they qualify for Medicaid. If they qualify for Medicaid, the exchange insurance sign-up will route them to sign up for Medicaid.\"\n\nDrawing an absolute conclusion about how many people signed up for Medicaid because of Obamacare isn\u2019t so simple, noted one health researcher.\n\n\"There\u2019s not a clean, easy way to measure who signed up because of the Affordable Care Act,\" said Cynthia Cox, who studies the ACA at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit research organization.\n\nIt\u2019s not always clear, she added, whether enrollees signed up because they heard about Medicaid expansion under the ACA or for other unrelated reasons.\n\nCongressman Kevin McCarthy claimed almost twice as many people have paid a penalty or taken a waiver as signed up for Obamacare.\n\nBy focusing only on enrollment through the Obamacare exchanges, McCarthy\u2019s claim presents a narrow and misleading look at total insurance sign-ups under the federal health law. Even under the limited view, those foregoing insurance do not amount to \"almost twice\" the exchange sign-ups.\n\nMost notably, the congressman\u2019s claim ignores the huge category of Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. Of the 20 million people who gained coverage under Obamacare through early 2016, about 14 million were under Medicaid.\n\nThe data show about the same number of people declined coverage -- not \"almost twice as many\" -- as signed-up for Obamacare.\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
