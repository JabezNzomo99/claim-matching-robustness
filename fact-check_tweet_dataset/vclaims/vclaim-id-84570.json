On the face of it, there is nothing unusual about this post. You will see scores of such abusive posts on social media on any given day. Yet we post it here for a reason. This and many other posts like this were \u201cliked\u201d by the official Twitter handle of the \u2018Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations, New York\u2019.\n\nThe twitter handle of India\u2019s mission at the United Nations regularly tweets updates from the External Affairs ministry about India\u2019s official engagements with other countries. Who would expect this account with a serious mandate to \u201clike\u201d posts abusing other political parties and their leaders? Yes, much to the shock of twitter users, the official Twitter handle of \u2018India\u2019s Permanent Mission to the United Nations\u2019 recorded its appreciation for a set of anti-AAP abusive posts last week. Is there an abusive troll sitting behind the keyboard of this important government handle?\n\nHere are a few examples of the posts that were \u201cliked\u201d by this twitter account:\n\nThe \u201clikes\u201d were for the responses to this tweet of AAP\n\nThe \u201clikes\u201d have now been deleted, or rather \u201cunliked\u201d. The number of likes which was earlier 1003 is now down to 936. This means that this official handle \u201cunliked\u201d close to 70 posts. There was no apology or explanation from the Ministry for this lapse.\n\nThis is not the first time that a government of India official handle has engaged in despicable social media behavior. Here are some other recent incidents.\n\nRecently, the Twitter handle of the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) had retweeted an anti-Congress post, calling Congress the enemy of India\n\nThe airport had apologized and claimed that its handle was \u201csubjected to a hacker attack\u201d. Interestingly, the hacker only posted one tweet from the account he hacked.\n\nIn October last year, the official twitter handle of the Indian postal service had tweeted an Anti-AAP post.\n\nWithin hours, India Post had tweeted an apology saying that the account was hacked. Once again, the hacker limited his activity to only one tweet.\n\nIn September 2016, the Twitter handle of Digital India, had tweeted a poem in Hindi, calling the Indian Army to fire at protesting Kashmiris.\n\nIf Mehbooba calls in the police,\n\n(Translated by an article in Quartz India.\n\nIn this case Electronics and Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had said, \u201cThe contents of the tweet don\u2019t represent the views of the IT ministry, Digital India or the government of India. I regret the tweet.\u201d He had also confirmed that the person who tweeted the poem has been suspended.\n\nThe official handle of All India Radio had tweeted about Rahul Gandhi, asking, \u201cWhy he got scared earlier? How he became daring again to defame #RSS?\u201d. This was in the context of the case was filed by the RSS against Rahul Gandhi for his remarks about the role of the RSS in the killing of Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nStart Up India, another important government initiative had retweeted two tweets abusing journalists.\n\nThe tweets were retracted and the account apologized to its followers.\n\nCommerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had explained this saying that \u201cThe unauthorised re-tweets were done by one employee of the agency duly hired by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion through a tendering process.\u201d\n\nClearly something is not right with the way government\u2019s social media accounts are being handled. It is likely that these tweets, retweets and likes were the result of using the same device for multiple twitter handles. The government is very keen to be visible on social media but such repeated incidents raise concerns about their readiness to do so and the selection and training of the social media team. Are there social media guidelines for the government? Barring a few cases where we have seen an apology and an explanation, the government departments have fumbled by claiming that the account was mysteriously hacked. The worst is when they stay silent in the hope that no one will notice it. Like how the \u2018official Twitter handle of the Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations, New York\u2019 has reacted in this case.", "lang": "en"}
