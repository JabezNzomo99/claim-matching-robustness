It\u2019s about which countries are viewed as most investment-friendly for renewable energy companies.\n\nIn the October 2016 edition, the UK is 14th of 40, behind Morocco and Japan. EY commented that \u201cuncertainty caused by Brexit, the closure of the Department of Energy & Climate Change and the approval of Hinkley Point C all dealt a sizeable blow to the UK renewables sector. Some respite came when the Government approved 1.8GW Hornsea 2, which will be the world\u2019s largest offshore wind farm if completed as planned\u201d.\n\nThe UK was at fourth in the index as recently as November 2013.\n\nAs so often, there are different ways of measuring these things.\n\nThe UK was fourth in the world for new investment in renewable energy (excluding \u201clarge hydro\u201d) in 2015, according to another report commissioned by a UN agency.\n\nIt said that China put over $100 billion into renewable that year, followed by the USA and Japan. The UK spent $22 billion, up 25% on the previous year.", "lang": "en"}
