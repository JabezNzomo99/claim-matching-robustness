Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.\n\n\"Jewish people are leaving the Democratic Party. We saw a lot of anti Israel policies start under the Obama Administration, and it got worsts [sic] & worse. There is anti-Semitism in the Democratic Party. They don\u2019t care about Israel or the Jewish people.\u2019 Elizabeth Pipko, Jexodus.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet combines some comments made earlier in the day on Fox & Friends by Pipko, spokeswoman for Jexodus. The new group aims to get young Jews to vote for Republicans. The Jewish vote has been a solid bloc for Democrats for decades.\n\nTrump has tried to appeal to Jewish voters, saying that the Democratic Party is \"anti-Israel\" and \"anti-Jewish\" after a House resolution that broadly condemned hate didn\u2019t specifically condemn Omar. She drew criticism for comments suggesting U.S. lawmakers are influenced on Israel by money and that Jews have dual loyalties.\n\nWe wondered if Jewish voters are ditching the Democrats after decades of party loyalty. We found no evidence to support the claim that Jewish voters have broken their long-term loyalty to the Democratic party. But we\u2019re not rating Trump\u2019s claim on the Truth-O-Meter, because there isn\u2019t 2019 polling data of Jewish voters.\n\nAfter PolitiFact asked about Trump\u2019s recent comments, Gallup said it would be at least several months for U.S. polling to be able to document whether Jews leave the party over some of its members\u2019 views on U.S. policy toward Israel.\n\n\"Although Trump has waded into the controversy, he has relatively few supporters among Jewish Americans,\" Gallup wrote. \"In fact, Jewish Americans were among the least likely to approve of Trump of all religious groups in 2018, with just 26 percent approving and 71 percent disapproving.\"\n\nJews are more Democratic and liberal than the electorate as a whole, University of Florida professor Kenneth Wald wrote in his recent book The Foundations of American Jewish Liberalism.\n\nIn the November 2018 midterms, 79 percent of Jews voted for Democrats for Congress, higher than 2014, but lower than 2006. Data from 2010 wasn\u2019t available.\n\nJews have consistently voted Democratic for president by wide margins, though the margin fluctuates.\n\nObama won 78 percent of the Jewish vote in 2008, according to Pew Research analysis of national exit poll data.\n\nThe support dropped in 2012 when Obama drew 69 percent of the Jewish vote, according to Pew.\n\nBut while Mitt Romney did better than other Republicans in recent cycles, Ronald Reagan drew a higher percentage of Jewish voters.\n\nIn 2016, Trump drew 24 percent of the Jewish vote, a drop from Romney. Hillary Clinton got 71 percent, slightly more than Obama in 2012.\n\nAnother way to look at the data is how Jews identify their party affiliation.\n\nPew Research survey data shows only small fluctuations. In 2008, 72 percent of Jews identified as Democrats or leaned Democrat, dropping by 1 point in 2012 and then rising to 74 percent in 2016. In 2017, Jewish Democratic identity dropped to 67 percent, at a similar level as many other non-election years since Obama. Pew didn\u2019t ask the identity question in 2018.\n\n\"The bottom line is Republicans have been trying for over 30 years to attract Jewish voters based on Israel and it hasn\u2019t worked,\" Wald said.\n\nMost Americans don\u2019t cast votes based solely on Israel, Wald said. Also, most Jews haven\u2019t seen any real distance between the two parties on Israel, and the Democratic Party is more closely aligned to Jewish opinions on other issues, he said.\n\nWald hadn\u2019t seen any polling data of Jewish voters after Omar\u2019s comments, which started in February.\n\n\"She said things that do worry Jews, but I think also they understand she is not a significant voice yet in the House \u2014 she is one representative who has gotten publicity,\" he said.\n\nIra Sheskin, a Jewish demographer at the University of Miami, said Orthodox Jews are the only subgroup that have become more Republican. But Orthodox Jews account for about 10 percent of the Jewish population.\n\nFinally, the Jewish electorate does not have a high opinion of President Trump.\n\nA 2018 American Jewish Committee poll found 71 percent had an unfavorable view of Trump, and 57 percent disapproved of the way he was handling U.S.-Israel relations. He also drew criticism for saying there were fine people on \"both sides\" of a protest in Charlottesville, Va., where white supremacists chanted \"Jews will not replace us.\"\n\nTrump said Jewish people are leaving the Democratic Party.\n\nObama\u2019s support among Jewish voters did drop between 2008 and 2012, but Jewish support ticked up slightly for Hillary Clinton. The level of Jewish support for Democratic presidential candidates remains well over 60 percent.\n\nWhile there are concerns among many Jews about recent statements by a Minnesota representative, there is no current evidence to suggest that Jewish voters are leaving the Democratic Party.", "lang": "en"}
