They continue to harass her even as she screams and tries to fend them off.\n\nThe same video was recently tweeted by Lord Nazir Ahmed, member of British House of Lords. Ahmed, however, deleted the tweet but not before BOOM had archived it.\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search on a few key-frames from the video and found articles from 2015 that carried the same video. The reports stated that the incident was from Casablanca, Morocco. A group of youngsters, according to reports, attacked a Muslim woman with eggs, flour and water on the day of Ashura. Ashura is the tenth day of Muharram. You can read the articles here and here.\n\nThe same video was also posted by Casablanca-based vlogger Yassine Jarram on his Facebook page.\n\nInterestingly, an article by France24 mentions that throwing eggs and flour is a Moroccan holiday tradition.\n\nThe article also reports about a second video posted by the men seen throwing eggs and flour on the Muslim woman. The woman supposedly seen in the first video also appears in this video and says that the youngsters were 'just having fun'. However, the video has been deleted. France24's article questioned whether the woman was forced to downplay the incident.", "lang": "en"}
