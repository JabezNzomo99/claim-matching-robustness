The fifth accused Gopiram belongs to a Scheduled Caste. In the clip, only one of the men can be seen beating the victim while the others remain silent bystanders.\n\nBOOM was able to track down the video through a reply to the tweet sharing the clip.\n\nWe reached out to Ravi Kumar Meghwal, national president of Dr Ambedkar Student Front of India (DAFSI) - the organisation mentioned in the letter above.\n\nRavi Kumar Meghwal said the police were slow to make arrests and only following protests by the community and a letter to the chief minister, were arrests made. He also said that the organisation was considering moving the Jodhpur High Court against the police.\n\nBOOM has not been independently able to verify the same.\n\nMeghwal also sent us an undated video of the victim's statement in which Sukharam Meghwal alleges that he had gone to the village to look for his cow which had strayed when three men assaulted him. The men accused him of stealing a cable. He also alleged that his wallet and locket were stolen by the accused.", "lang": "en"}
