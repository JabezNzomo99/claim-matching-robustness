Let\u2019s try to check the authenticity of the image in the post.\n\nClaim: The photo shows 75-year-old Muslim man, who married his 15-year-old daughter. Fact: The old man is not the girl\u2019s father. The girl (a 16-year-old Hyderabad girl) was married to the old man (a Muscat national) for 5 lakhs. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image in the photo is run through Google Reverse Image Search, many news stories containing the same photo can be found in the search results. According to the news story in NDTV, a 16-year-old Hyderabad girl was married to a 75-year-old Muscat national for Rs. 5 lakhs. The case attracted media attention in August 2017 when the mother of the girl approached the police to help her daughter, who complained to her mother that she is being ill-treated by her husband in Muscat. Not only media, even Maneka Gandhi, then Woman and Child Development Minister, tweeted about this forcible marriage. More details about the case can be read here and here.\n\nTo sum it up, the 75-year-old man in the photo is not the girl\u2019s father.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
