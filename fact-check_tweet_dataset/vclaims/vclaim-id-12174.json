The doctored image has been widely shared on Facebook.\n\nThe 116th Congress, elected in November and inaugurated this month, includes many new faces, including a record number of women. Just days after Election Day, some newly elected Democratic congresswomen posed for a photo labeled \u201cSquad\u201d that was posted to social media by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Joining her in the photo were Reps. Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib.\n\nWeeks later, the photo resurfaced online with some new additions: an \u201cUnfit to Serve: Impeach Trump\u201d poster, a painting of Osama bin Laden and a flag that has been associated with ISIS. In a more subtle change, closer inspection shows that the congresswomen\u2019s faces have been doctored.\n\nWhile Tlaib did attract criticism for her profane declaration of support for impeaching President Donald Trump, Democrats remain divided on the issue, and the \u201cImpeach Trump\u201d poster, along with the other edits, did not appear in the original photograph.\n\nAccompanying the doctored photo in some posts are captions ranging from \u201cGET THESE TERRORIST SYMPATHIZERS OUT OF OUR GOVERNMENT NOW TRUMP\u201d to \u201cThis is an example of voters with mental illness,\u201d among others.\n\nThe Photoshopped image was shared widely on Facebook, and was flagged by users as potentially false. The original photo was posted on Instagram, where it remains available for comparison. It was taken on Nov. 12, the day of the Congressional Progressive Caucus\u2019s freshman member orientation.\n\nTlaib, Omar, and Ocasio-Cortez have been the subject of other misinformation campaigns in recent weeks, some of which have centered around Omar and Tlaib\u2019s religion, as we have written.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nBade, Rachael, Heather Caygle and John Bresnahan. \u201cDems Livid After Tlaib Vows to \u2018Impeach the Motherf-er.\u201d Politico. 4 Jan 2019.\n\nDeSilver, Drew. \u201cA Record Number of Women Will Be Serving in the New Congress.\u201d Pew Research Center. 18 Dec 2018.\n\nJohnson, Jake. \u201cAt Freshman Orientation, Young and Growing Progressive Caucus Makes Clear It Will \u2018Fight Like Hell\u2019 For Bold Democratic Agenda.\u201d Originally Published in Common Dreams.
