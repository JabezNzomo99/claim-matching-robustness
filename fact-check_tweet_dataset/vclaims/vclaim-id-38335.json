Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nFact: The photo was taken in Syria in February 2018. It is not related to the recent Delhi violence. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image was searched using Google Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found on the \u2018Getty Images\u2019 website. On that website, the photo has the following description: \u2018A wounded Syrian boy covered in blood waits to receive treatment at a make-shift hospital in Kafr Batna in the besieged Eastern Ghouta region on the outskirts of the capital Damascus following Syrian government bombardments on February 21, 2018\u2019. So, the boy was not injured in Delhi and the photo is not related to Delhi violence.\n\nTo sum it up, the boy is not from Delhi and the photo is not related to Delhi violence. The photo is of an injured Syrian boy.\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
