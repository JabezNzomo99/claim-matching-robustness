It then was shared by at least four other agencies and appeared at the top of the Russian search engine Yandex.ru, displaying all the elements of a deliberate information campaign.\n\nThe piece accused Novaya Gazeta of working on the West\u2019s orders to undermine the Russian state. In particular, it claimed that Novaya Gazeta is following the orders of exiled Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a longtime rival of President Vladimir Putin. The writer dismissed as \u201cfake\u201d a series of groundbreaking investigative reports by Novaya Gazeta unmasking the activities of the Russian private military company Wagner and its owner Yevgeniy Progozhin, and claimed Wagner does not exist.\n\nOur fact check found all three claims to be false.\n\nAlthough Mikhail Khodorkovsky does have ties, including financial, with some Russian media outlets, Novaya Gazeta is not one of them.\n\nDmitry Muratov, the founder and former chief editor of Novaya Gazeta, told Polygraph.info in a phone interview that the newspaper has \u201cabsolutely no financial or otherwise relations with Mikhail Khodorkovsky.\u201d\n\nMuratov said Novaya Gazeta receives financial support from two Russian citizens he said would prefer not to identify, in order to avoid putting them under direct threat from the Russian government.\n\nMuratov said the Russian businessman Alexander Lebedev, a longtime supporter of Novaya Gazeta who once owned a 39% stake of the newspaper, had to stop aiding Novaya Gazeta financially because of government pressure. To protect the newspaper, Lebedev ultimately gave the majority of his shares to Novaya Gazeta\u2019s staff.\n\nCurrently, the newspaper\u2019s staff owns a 76% controlling stake, while Lebedev holds a 14% stake and former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev holds a 10% stake.\n\nIn September, Novaya Gazeta published a plea for donations, citing a lack of funds and financial hardship that put the newspaper on the edge of closure.\n\nNovaya Gazeta has published a series of investigative reports detailing the activities of the man known as President Vladimir Putin\u2019s confidant and chef, Yevgeny Prigozhin.\n\nPrigozhin is reportedly involved in the Kremlin\u2019s disinformation campaigns both abroad and in Russia, having under his control the Internet Research Agency, also known as the \u201ctroll factory.\u201d\n\nAs part of its investigative series, Novaya Gazeta published several reports on the activities and origins of Wagner, Prigozhin\u2019s private military company, which, contrary to the claim made by \u201cJournalistic Truth,\u201d does exist, as shown in the reporting done by Polygraph.info and many others.\n\nHowever, according to Muratov, Novaya Gazeta \u201cnever wrote about hundreds of deaths of Wagner mercenaries.\u201d\n\nThe paramilitary personnel, who many describe as mercenaries, themselves claimed these numbers in an appeal to the International Criminal Court, in which they demanded that the Russian owners of private military companies be investigated, and blamed the Russian government for \u201cnot honoring\u201d the mercenaries\u2019 sacrifices in \u201cthe Donbas, Syria, Libya, the Central African Republic, Gabon.\u201d\n\nWhile the Kremlin firmly denies any military involvement in these conflicts, the mercenaries claimed in their appeal to the International Criminal Court that they have fought on the orders of the Russian state, and demanded official recognition as veterans entitled to government pensions. The appeal was signed by 357 PMC veterans from 52 Russian regions.\n\nThe \u201cAbout us\u201d section of Journalistic Truth describes the website as an \u201cinformation-analysis outlet dedicated to the mass media in Russia and in the world.\u201d\n\nThe website\u2019s office is located on Krasnogvardeisky Lane 23 in Saint Petersburg same as its founder, the Federal News Agency, which has been identified as one of the arms of Prigozhin\u2019s troll farm.\n\n\u201cWe have been targeted by Prigozhin and his hundreds of \u2018media\u2019 for our investigative work. He had his spies trying to infiltrate our staff, his people physically attacking our offices, but it is beneath Novaya Gazeta to respond to them directly. We will continue doing our journalistic investigations,\u201d Muratov told Polygraph.info.\n\nTracking the paths of the Journalistic Truth piece to other outlets, and ultimately to the top of the Yandex.ru search engine, reveals another arm of the troll farm \u2013 this one in Russian-occupied Crimea.\n\nThe name of author of the attack on Novaya Gazeta, Alexandr Rogers, means nothing to Russia watchers. Yet, at the time of this publication, he ranks #24 on the list of the top 100 Russian language blogs. On the popular web portal 24smi.org he is profiled as a celebrity, and his Twitter account has around 3K followers.\n\nBesides his pieces published on the Journalistic Truth website, Rogers has nearly 200 articles under his byline on the website NewsFront.info, where his piece on Novaya Gazeta has also been featured linking to the original Journalistic Truth publication.\n\nNewsFront.info publishes in Russian, Bulgarian, German, English, Estonian, Serbian, French and Hungarian, and positions itself as Crimea\u2019s leading news agency.\n\nAccording to Russian tax authorities\u2019 data, NewsFront.info was registered with Roskomnadzor (the Russian federal agency regulating mass media and communications) in April 2015 as a private \u201cnews agency\u201d by a company called \"Media Group News Front.\" For fiscal 2017, NewsFront.info declared a budget of 712,000 rubles (around $12,200).\n\nThe tax authority\u2019s database lists Media Group News Front\u2019s physical address as: Gagarina Street 11, Apartment 21, Bakhchisaray, Republic of Crimea.\n\nThe official physical address is at odds with the IP data, which may be due to the use of VPN services. While the IP address for NewsFront.info is protected from tracking, a Whois.com search found the following information about the website administrator:\n\nNotably, the phone numbers listed for the administrator of the website begin with the Moscow city code (495), and Google Maps drops the location pin for the zip code \u201c123007\u201d somewhere in Khoroshyovsky district, just outside of Moscow\u2019s Third Ring.\n\nThere are also other peculiarities about the physical address: according to registry data, a firm called Global Information Technologies is located in the same office suite as the News-Front.info agency and Media Group News Front, while the three companies report no formal ties.\n\nAnother odd connection with \u201cinformation technologies\u201d is that the Crimean Federal University (owned by the Russian state) lists Media Group News Front as one of the main \u201cguaranteed employment options\u201d for its graduates in \u201cIT programming and computer systems\u201d \u2013 a degree reportedly in high demand among Russian intelligence cyber units and with Prigozhin\u2019s Internet Research Agency.\n\nFinally, Sergey Veselovsky, listed as a founder of both Media Group News Front and Global Information Technologies, is known for his video blogs from the Russian side of the conflict zone in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region.\n\nOne of his Donbas \u201cfrontline\u201d interviews featured Maria Butina, the accused Russian agent arrested in the United States, who Veselvosky presented as \u201cnasha boyevaya podruga\u201d \u2013 \u201cour sister in arms.\u201d Butina\u2019s photo continues to be featured as the \u201cprofile\u201d photo on social media for the Russian Federation\u2019s Foreign Ministry.\n\nOddly, one of the places where Veselovsky checks in on his Facebook account is Salisbury, UK \u2013showing that he visited the town where Russian intelligence used the military grade chemical agent Novichok earlier this year to poison a former spy.", "lang": "en"}
