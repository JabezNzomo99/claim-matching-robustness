But when it comes to being an actor on the international stage, the law is something that Moscow appeals to selectively.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "November 22, 2018", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-13360", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-sanctions-illegal-claim-fact-check/29613539.html", "vclaim": "During Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s two-day state visit to Singapore, where the two countries are marking 50 years of diplomatic ties, Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov gave an exclusive interview to Television Rain, in which he spoke about the need for the importance of maintaining trade ties with the United States.\n\nWhen the topic turned to U.S. and Western sanctions against Russia, Peskov took issue with the word \"sanctions.\"\n\n\"Sanctions conform to international law. In this case, we don\u2019t recognize those unilateral restrictions as legitimate sanctions because we deem them to be illegal,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it will probably be more correct to say \u2018limitations\u2019 or \u2018restrictions,\u2019 but not sanctions.\u201d\n\nRussia is currently facing a series of sanctions from the U.S. and its allies over the annexation of Crimea, military involvement in Eastern Ukraine, the death of Sergei Magnitsky, interference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election and the deployment of a military grade nerve agent \u201cNovichok\u201d\u2013 in the attempted assassination of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury, England.\n\nThose sanctions target dozens of individuals and entities, taking aim at specific sectors of the Russian economy, including armaments and energy, with an eye towards restricting access to Western capital markets and dual-use and other sensitive technologies.\n\nThe sanctions effectively \u201cfreeze\u201d financial assets of the sanctioned entities on U.S. territory and ban U.S. individuals and groups from engaging in business transactions with named Russian individuals and groups.\n\nThe European Union has currently enacted sanctions against 155 people from Russia and Ukraine as a result of Russia\u2019s 2014 seizure of Crimea and military involvement in Eastern Ukraine, which the U.S. State Department calls \u201cforcible control\u201d by Russia.\n\nThe EU has also frozen the assets of 44 entities from both countries, with sources in Brussels telling Radio Free Europe five more individuals were set to be sanctioned over separatist-organized elections on November 11 in the so-called \u201cDonetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Republics,\u201d which the United States, France and Germany have called a \u201csham\u201d and \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\nPeskov and other Russian officials have previously attempted to portray such sanctions as illegal.\n\nAs Polygraph.info reported in August 2017, Andrey Klimov, Deputy Chairman of Foreign Affairs Committee, Federation Council, similarly argued the sanctions are illegal because the only sanctions recognized by international law are those of the UN Security Council.\n\nRussia and other parties have also contested the use of unilateral sanctions, citing the World Trade Organization\u2019s General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which, among other things, includes the right to trade without discrimination.\n\nBill Browder, the U.S. born British financer who spearheaded the Magnitsky Act, which bans Russian officials suspected of human rights abuses from stepping foot on U.S. soil, freezes their assets, and bars U.S. firms from carrying out financial transactions with them, told Polygraph.info there is \u201cno truth\u201d to Peskov\u2019s statement.\n\n\u201cThe sanctions that are currently in place are travel bans and asset freezes in the countries where this is happening and it\u2019s not a function of international law, it\u2019s a function of domestic law. The United States has a right to deny entry to anyone it wants \u2013 It\u2019s a privilege to travel to the United States, not a right. And furthermore, it\u2019s a privilege to use the U.S. banking system,\u201d Browder said.\n\n\u201cThe only thing he can say is the UN can\u2019t sanction anybody but individual member states can do anything they want,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cU.S. sanctions are legal under U.S. law because the U.S. jurisdiction over its own banking system and currency,\u201d he said. \u201cAny company or financial institution, U.S. or not, that seeks the benefits of or access to the U.S. financial system or U.S. markets needs to comply with US laws.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that sanctions against Russia itself came as the result of violations of international law, noting the \u201cinvasion and occupation of Ukraine and annexation of its territory.\n\nAnd, Moscow itself has been no stranger to imposing unilateral sanctions despite claims they must be sanctioned through the UN Security Council.\n\n\u201cAs for Russian claims that sanctions are valid only with UN authorization, I don\u2019t recall any such restraint when it came to Russia\u2019s sanctions against imports from the EU, its sanctions against Ukraine, or its sanctions against Georgia,\u201d Fried said.\n\nIn January 2009, then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed a decree banning exports of military and dual purpose products to Georgia in a bid to restrict military cooperation with the small Caucasian state following the 2008 Russo-Georgian War.\n\nCountries or individuals found to be in breach of Russia\u2019s unilaterally imposed regulations faced economic and financial sanctions, RIA Novosti reported at the time.\n\nEarlier this month, Russia drew up counter sanctions against Ukraine, targeting 322 individuals and 68 businesses.\n\nAs a result of the Ukraine crisis, in 2014 Moscow announced counter sanctions against 10 American citizens, and banned 10 Canadian officials from entering Russia. Russia also recently \u201cmarked\u201d the four-year anniversary of its import ban on certain Western products in response to Ukraine-related sanctions, which targeted the United States, the EU, Norway, Canada and Australia.\n\nThose sanctions resulted in highly publicized scenes of Russian authorities bulldozing tons of foodstuffs.\n\nRegarding claims the sanctions violate GATT, Article XXI, of the agreement covers \u201cSecurity Exceptions,\u201d which legalizes the right of any nation to impose unilateral sanctions against another country when \u201cessential security interests\u201d are involved, Polygraph.info previously reported.\n\nWhile the text of GATT has been reviewed and amended several times since its creation shortly after World War II, Article XXI has never been amended.\n\nA number of scholars, however, do lay out rather stringent criteria for the imposition of sanctions, which provide room for debate over the extent of sanctions but not their legality.\n\nRuth Wedgwood, a law professor at Johns Hopkins University, told Polygraph.info that the U.S. government cannot arbitrarily target entities of a foreign government but said that suspicions of illicit activity may provide it with sufficient grounds for assets freezes.\n\nMichael Reisman, a professor of international law at Yale Law School, said that in the event of sanctions, the measures should be \u201cproportional,\u201d that sanctions should be \u201cnecessary to achieve an explicit and lawful objective,\u201d and differentiate between the elite who are \u201cresponsible for the offensive behavior\u201d and the \u201crank-and-file.\u201d\n\nRussia itself has a complex relationship with international law. From its occupation of Georgian, Ukrainian and Moldovan territory, annexation of Crimea, multiple alleged assassinations on English soil, alleged war crimes in Syria and use of its own unilateral sanctions.\n\nPeskov\u2019s appeal to international law to counter Western sanctions is at best misleading.\n\nBased on the available evidence, Peskov\u2019s claim that such measures don\u2019t conform with international law are false.", "lang": "en"}
