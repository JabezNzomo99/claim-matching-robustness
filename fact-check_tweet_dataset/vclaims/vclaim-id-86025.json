Is that correct?", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-05-01T14:34:56Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-86025", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2013/09/12/has-mitch-mcconnell-done-nothing-in-the-fight-against-obamacare/", "vclaim": "Bevin\u2019s statement comes in the context of a nascent effort to \u201cdefund\u201d the law before it goes into effect. The effort is being pushed by a group of Senate conservatives, who vow to block a new spending bill for the government unless all funding is halted for the health care law.\n\nThis is a quixotic effort. Most of the law is funded through mandatory spending, while the spending bill concerns discretionary spending, though the lawmakers insist they can get around this hurdle. Even so, Democrats control the Senate\u2014and Obama holds the veto pen. Most establishment Republicans believe such a showdown will simply play into Obama\u2019s hands, because the GOP will get blamed for a government shutdown.\n\nNevertheless, the Senate Conservatives Fund has launched a TV ad in Kentucky charging that McConnell is doing \u201cnothing\u201d to stop the law, and Bevin has jumped on the same bandwagon.\n\nA Bevin aide said that Bevin\u2019s remarks concerned the effort to defund the law. \u201cMcConnell only voted to defund Obamacare when he knew there was no fight and the bill would fail \u2014 he refuses to fight against Obamacare when it could actually matter,\u201d the aide claimed.\n\nIn a recent speech at the RedState Gathering, Bevin made a similar claim: \u201cHe parades around the dolly full of paper, with the big red ribbons around it, has a lot of great rhetoric about yanking things out root and branch, but it is so much empty promises, so much false advertising, and it is time for him to stand up, to stop talking and to start leading on this.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t want to get in a middle of an intramural fight, but this appears to be mostly a question of tactics about the right course of action now. McConnell stands to become majority leader if the Republicans win control of the Senate, and he has said that \u201cshutting down the government will not stop Obamacare.\u201d\n\nMcConnell, as Obama would attest, has been a consistent thorn in the side of the administration on the health-care law. For instance, McConnell helped ensure that not a single Republican\u2014including even moderates who were sympathetic to Obama\u2019s aims\u2013voted for the final version of the law.\n\nIt\u2019s just the latest act in a play that saw McConnell give more than 100 floor speeches critical of Democratic reforms and paper Capitol Hill with more 225 messaging documents in the 10 months before Obamacare\u2019s passage. Away from the public spotlight, McConnell worked his caucus hard to convince them to unite against the law, holding a health care meeting every Wednesday afternoon. GOP aides said they could not remember a time before, or since, when a Republican leader held a weekly meeting with members that focused solely on one subject.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s office provided The Fact Checker with links to the more than 100 speeches, made between June 2009 and March 2010, and they were often fairly tough. Indeed, as Talking Points Memo has noted, the irony is rich that anti-Obamacare machine McConnell helped foster has now turned against him.\n\nBevin needs to restrain his rhetoric. While McConnell appears skeptical of Bevin\u2019s preferred route to end the health-care law, that\u2019s not an excuse to invent a fictional McConnell who \u201cnever stood on the floor of the Senate to actually rally\u201d against Obamacare when the Democrats pushed the law through Congress\u2013and who since then has repeatedly sought to repeal or dismantle the law.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s success in uniting Republicans in opposition to Obama\u2019s vision greatly hobbled Obama\u2019s achievement, as the president can never claim he had bipartisan backing for a health-care overhaul. That\u2019s the root of the law\u2019s political problems to this day.", "lang": "en"}
