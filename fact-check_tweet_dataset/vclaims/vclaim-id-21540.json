On average these found that 6% of people thought Wales should be independent.\n\nThe most popular view was that the Welsh Assembly should get more powers (41% of people on average said this), followed by the Welsh Assembly\u2019s powers staying the same (29%). Around 17% of people thought that the Welsh Assembly should be abolished altogether and roughly 3% said it\u2019s powers should be reduced. The rest didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t say.\n\nA separate poll done in July last year asked people whether they thought Wales should be independent, with only a \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019 answer to choose between. 15% said \u2018Yes\u2019, and 65% said \u2018No\u2019. 20% said they didn\u2019t know or wouldn't vote, a higher proportion than when last asked the question in 2014.\n\nThe same poll also had questions tied to specific events. One asked how people thought they\u2019d vote on the issue of Welsh independence if Scotland were to become independent first. 19% of people said they would vote \u2018Yes\u2019, compared to 17% of people when the same question was asked two years before. 61% of people said that they\u2019d vote \u2018No\u2019, compared to 69% in 2014.\n\nAnother asked people whether they\u2019d vote for Welsh independence if it meant Wales could stay in the EU while the rest of the UK left. 28% of people said they\u2019d vote for independence while 53% of people said they\u2019d vote against it. The rest didn\u2019t know or wouldn\u2019t say.\n\nLastly, we\u2019ve had questions from readers asking us whether polls are accurate reflections of public opinion. We hope to address this question in a future piece.", "lang": "en"}
