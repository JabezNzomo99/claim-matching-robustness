The U.K. government is not sending text messages notifying people of fines they have incurred for violating the stay-at-home order.\n\nOn March 23, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered people not to leave their homes except for limited purposes, including shopping for food and medicine and exercising once a daily, in an effort to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. The U.K. government said that it would send a text message to people throughout the country informing them of these rules.\n\nThe viral Facebook post contains two text messages allegedly sent by the British government. The top text message matches the real one sent to U.K. residents with registered phone numbers.\n\n\u201cGOV.UK CORONAVIRUS ALERT,\u201d reads the authentic text message. \u201cNew rules in force now: you must stay at home. More info & Exceptions at gov.uk/coronavirus Stay at home. Protect the NHS. Save lives.\u201d\n\nThe second text message, though also attributed in the post to the sender \u201cUK_Gov,\u201d was not sent by the British government, however.
