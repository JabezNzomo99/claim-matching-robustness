Revised figures from the same researchers show that specialised mental health services for new mothers are now slightly more widespread, but they\u2019re still unavailable in four out of every 10 areas of England.\n\n\u2018Perinatal\u2019 mental health services are provided to mothers throughout pregnancy and until their child is 12 months old.\n\nThe Daily Mail told us that its figure comes from NHS England, which said last week that \u201cmore than 40 percent [of areas] provide no service at all.\u201d The NHS also says in its mental health strategy, published in July 2016, that if the areas where community perinatal mental health services don\u2019t meet Royal College of Psychiatrists guidelines are added to those with no service at all, that amounts to 85% of health areas in England.\n\nThis is based on a 2014 report, which contained figures from the Royal College of Psychiatrists on maternal mental health coverage. But more up-to-date information is available.\n\nThese updated figures show that 39%, or 82 out of 211 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), did not provide any specialist community mental health services for new mothers across the whole CCG. This is as of December 2015.\n\nThat\u2019s not the same as saying that 39% of women have no access to community perinatal mental health services. For example, London has much more such services, so the proportion of women in the population with access to them could be higher than their geographical reach.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the data refers specifically to specialist community mental health care. The same 2014 report cited by the NHS found that 90% of mothers who were treated for perinatal mental health problems received care from a GP or another primary health care provider.\n\nSpecialist community care is often required by pregnant or new mothers with more complex mental health conditions.\n\nAnd the report also notes that its coverage map was put together using information from local experts and has not been independently verified.\n\nOver 60% of areas have a specialised service, but only 20% meet Royal College of Psychiatrists standards\n\nThe figures show that only 41 of the CCGs, or 19%, had a specialised perinatal mental health community team that met Royal College of Psychiatrists standards. The remaining 42% ran some form of service but didn\u2019t meet the recommended standard.\n\nWithout specialist community services available, care for women with perinatal mental health problems is often provided by general adult mental health services.\n\nScotland has a similar number of areas with no specialist community provision, whereas Wales and Northern Ireland have even fewer.\n\nThe figures were gathered by the Royal College of Psychiatrists and published by the Maternal Mental Health Alliance. This brings together over seventy organisations across the UK, including NHS England and the Royal College of Psychiatrists, concerned with the issue of mothers\u2019 mental health.\n\nOther studies say 60% of CCGs have no perinatal mental health strategy\n\nClinical Commissioning Groups were set up in 2013. They\u2019re responsible for sourcing healthcare services in a particular area of England. CCGs include GPs, nurses and consultants and the care they source includes planned hospital care, emergency care, rehabilitation, most community health services and mental health services.\n\nAnother study found only 3% of CCGs surveyed had a strategy for providing perinatal mental health services. 18% were developing one, but 60% had no strategy or any plans to develop one.\n\nThe rest either didn\u2019t reply or directed the query to their local NHS Trust. This is based on Freedom of Information requests in 2014 from 194 of the 211 CCGs.\n\nThe same study also asked 193 NHS Trusts, which often provide the healthcare services that CCGs purchase, about their perinatal mental health offering. There are currently 210 acute and mental health NHS trusts in England.\n\nIt found that 26% provided a service, 3% offered a minimal service, 54% didn\u2019t provide a service and the rest did not respond.\n\nUp to 20% of women experience perinatal mental health problems\n\nBetween 10% and 20% of new mothers experience some form of mental health problem either during pregnancy or in the first year of their baby\u2019s life. These issues can include stress, obsessive-compulsive disorders, eating disorders, psychosis and depression.\n\nIn up to 50% of cases where mothers suffer from perinatal depression or anxiety it goes undetected, even when they are routinely in contact with medical services, according to a report by the London School of Economics and the Centre for Mental Health.\n\nThe issue is in the news now because NHS England has just launched a new Perinatal Community Services Development Fund which it hopes will help to increase the mental health services available to new and expectant mothers.\n\nWe updated this article to include the results of the National Childbirth Trust\u2019s Freedom of Information request and information on perinatal mental health problems.", "lang": "en"}
