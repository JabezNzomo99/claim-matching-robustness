Experts say there are simple precautions people can take to kill bacteria in meat and organs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you see bubbles and white spots in animal meat, please avoid eating it. It is animal TB and very dangerous.\u201d TB is the bacterial disease tuberculosis.\n\nThis advice has been shared on WhatsApp in South Africa. It includes a photo of what seems to be a raw ribcage covered in white spots.\n\nThe photo and message have also been shared on\n\nDo these \u201cbubbles\u201d and \u201cwhite spots\u201d indicate tuberculosis in meat that can infect people if they eat it? We investigated.\n\nof the WhatsApp message found several websites that credited the photo to the\n\nin the US.\n\nconfirmed that it was their photo. It shows the ribcage of a white-tailed deer infected with bovine tuberculosis (bTB).\n\nHe said that the description in the WhatsApp message was not entirely accurate: the \"lesions pictured are not bubbles, they are small, solid abscesses\u201d.\n\nPeople can be infected with bovine TB\n\nThere are different types of TB. The main type that affects people is caused by the bacteria\n\nBut it\u2019s important to know the difference\n\n\u201cHuman TB is transmitted between people and bovine TB is transmitted between cattle or from cattle to other animals or humans.\u201d Bovine TB is caused by a bacteria called\n\nPeople can be infected with bovine TB by coming into contact with infected cattle or by eating parts of an infected animal, O\u2019Brien said. Another common cause of infection, particularly in children, is drinking unpasteurised cow's milk.\n\nMichel told us that when people fall ill with human TB or bovine TB, the \u201csymptoms are indistinguishable and can present as pulmonary [human] TB\u201d. Drinking contaminated milk could cause \u201can inflammation of the lymph nodes, most commonly in the neck area\u201d.\n\n, who has a PhD in veterinary immunology and leads research on animal tuberculosis at\n\n, told Africa Check that bovine TB was unlikely to infect meat.\n\n\u201cMeat is usually skeletal muscle and the mycobacteria don\u2019t typically infect this type of tissue \u2013 it is more common in lymph nodes, lungs, and organs such as liver, spleen.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources said the same about the white abscesses in the WhatsApp message: it\u2019s \u201cessentially never seen in the actual [muscle tissue] of the deer that people would typically eat\u201d.\n\nMichel said regulated meat inspections meant it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that meat infected with bovine TB would be sold in South Africa\u2019s formal meat markets.\n\nBut there is a risk for people who keep and slaughter animals at home. She said in these cases, there was a chance that people could get bovine TB by eating raw or undercooked organs or drinking infected milk.\n\nMeat and milk should be cooked properly\n\nPeople should still be wary of eating meat with spots or bubbles, Miller cautioned.\n\n\u201cWhite spots can be associated with a wide number of different conditions besides TB,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be unwise to eat any meat that has bubbles and white spots regardless of what caused it.\u201d\n\nExperts say there are simple precautions people can take to kill bacteria in meat and organs.

But they\u2019re unlikely to get bovine TB from meat sold in formal markets.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure about the meat or internal organs that you are about to eat, thoroughly cook the meat at a higher temperature. Unpasteurised milk should be boiled to make it safe to drink.", "lang": "en"}
