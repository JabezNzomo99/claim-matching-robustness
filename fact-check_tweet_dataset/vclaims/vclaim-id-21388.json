The caption in the viral video states that Dr. Harish Shukla of Apollo Hospital made this video. Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral claim is false.\n\nA video is shared on Facebook by a user named Vnita Vnita Punjab. The video is shared with a caption that reads: \u2018This video was made by Apollo Hospital\u2019s doctor Harish Shukla during the operation. Our digestion system is not able to digest noodles. That\u2019s why noodles were surgically removed from a patient. Protect your children from noodles. Please watch the video and share it for humanity\u2019s sake.\u201d This is not the first time such video has been shared. The video is viral across social media with different claims.\n\nVishvas News started its investigation by breaking down various elements of the viral post. We used InVid tool and performed reverse image search on the keyframes using Yandex search engine. This gave us a result which appears to be one of the oldest instances of the viral video.\n\nThe video was uploaded on August 24, 2015 by a channel of a Youtuber named Dr. Paresh Ruparel. The video was posted with a caption that said, \u201cMultiple roundworms in the small intestine..surgical removal done..\u201d\n\nThe same video was used with a different caption stating that roundworms were present in the small intestines which were surgically removed.\n\nIt was also claimed in the viral video that a doctor in Apollo Hospitals created the video. Vishvas News contacted the PRO of Apollo Hospitals. The PRO of Apollo hospital denied any connection of the video with Apollo Hospital.\n\nVishvas News also contacted Dr. Sajeev Kumar, who is a General Physician. He said that \u201cthese are definitely not noodles. Noodles. When it comes to digestion, the process of digesting any food, starts way before it reaches intestines.\u201d\n\nThe claim of the viral video stating that noodles are being surgically removed from the intestines of a person is fake.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right.
