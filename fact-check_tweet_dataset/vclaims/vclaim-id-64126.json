The page does not appear to be affiliated with the Trump campaign.\n\nThe viral Instagram post shows what appears to be a screen grabbed tweet from Trump\u2019s verified Twitter account asking his followers to follow a specific Instagram page he allegedly created. (RELATED: Did Trump Tweet That He Would \u2018Never Let Thousands Of Americans Die From A Pandemic\u2019 In 2009?)\n\n\u201cElections are on it\u2019s (sic) way,\u201d Trump purportedly tweeted. \u201cI have created a movement for the Instagram Page: \u2018AmericanForTrump2020\u2019 Please follow and show your support! We will be giving updates frequently!\u201d\n\nHowever, there is no evidence Trump actually tweeted this statement. A search of Trump\u2019s verified Twitter accounts \u2013 @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS \u2013 turned up no such tweet. Check Your Fact also did not find the comment in the Trump Twitter Archive, a database of Trump\u2019s tweets dating back to May 2009. Nor were there any similar remarks in ProPublica\u2019s archive of his deleted tweets.\n\nWhile the Instagram page does exist, it does not appear to be officially affiliated with the Trump campaign. The page is private and lacks a verification badge, unlike other Trump campaign accounts such as Trump War Room and Black Voices for Trump, which are both verified and public.\n\nTrump is often the subject of fake tweets, which can be easily fabricated using websites such as FakeTrumpTweet.com and FakeTweetGenerator.com. Check Your Fact has previously debunked several tweets falsely attributed to Trump, including one claiming he tweeted, \u201cWHO Thinks \u2018Child Lifes (sic) Matter\u2019 Should Be PAINTED In The STREETS Of Hollywood???\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.", "lang": "en"}
