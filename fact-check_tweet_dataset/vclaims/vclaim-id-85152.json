Politics is personal, which means fact checks are, too, especially when our ratings or analyses challenge people\u2019s core political beliefs. Some of our loudest critics are our most dedicated readers, who hold us to a high standard and make sure we know when they think we failed to deliver. They send lengthy emails, laden with bullet points and citations, to explain why they disagreed with our rating or analysis.\n\nThe messages that landed in my inbox, Twitter mentions and even my newsroom mailbox became more vitriolic as November approached. Increasingly, it wasn\u2019t what I wrote that angered these readers; it was that I wrote it while being me. It felt like they read my byline, saw my photo, barely skimmed what I wrote, and decided I was incompetent because I\u2019m a 28-year-old Asian woman.\n\nAn email calling me the c-word was the first thing I read when I woke up one morning. One night after dinner, my phone buzzed with a Twitter mention from someone wishing I were sent to an internment camp (I\u2019m not Japanese). Many emails began with, \u201cNi hao\u201d (I\u2019m not Chinese). I even learned a new slur word that I had to look up in the Urban Dictionary \u2014 but will refrain from sharing here.\n\n\u201cMichelle, the sex workers in Times Square have more integrity about their prostitution than you have about yours. You can prostitute yourself by letting people use your genius, just as you can prostitute yourself by letting them use your genitals.\u201d\n\nTo the reader who wrote me and Glenn to say that \u201cthe Asian c\u2011\u2011\u2011\u201d was \u201cworse\u201d between the two of us, I asked: Is it my being Asian or being a woman that makes me, in your view, worse than white or male? I received no response.\n\nTo the reader who made a snide Facebook comment about my being an Asian woman, I replied: What does my being Asian or a woman have to do with the quality of my work as a journalist? I received no response.\n\nIn fact, most people didn\u2019t respond when I wrote them back. The few who did reply either doubled down on the insult or apologized, saying they were too emotional when they wrote me.\n\nI didn\u2019t travel on the campaign trail this election. I wasn\u2019t blacklisted. No one booed or yelled at me. But I was berated almost daily for doing my job, and so were many other reporters on and off the trail. I understand people feeling frustrated with the media. What I can\u2019t relate to is what, exactly, compels some people to describe in detail how I\u2019m prostituting myself or how I will be raped by an illegal Mexican immigrant. (Many of the comments were in response to my fact checks of Donald Trump, but not all.)\n\nI hope such comments were a product of heightened emotions as Election Day approached \u2014 not the new normal. And I have a good reason to be hopeful: The vast majority of Fact Checker readers I\u2019ve communicated with are opinionated, thoughtful, respectful, brutally honest and passionate about the truth. I have hope, because of readers like one I emailed with recently, who wrote me a valid point-by-point critique that ended with this:\n\n\u201cI would like to thank you for writing me back. I am sorry that I wrote \u2018Do Better\u2019 in the subject line. I was hoping that someone would read it and did not figure it would actually go to you. I am now engaged in the sort of harsh discourse that I deplore. \u2026\n\nThe fact that you wrote me back is awesome. I am honored. And it shows me that you do care about your journalism. For what it is worth, I think you have one of the most important jobs in the world. I mean that. If you doggedly truth checked stories, you could single-handedly impact our polity.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
