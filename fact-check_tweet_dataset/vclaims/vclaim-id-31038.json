She was not asking him to go back.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nThe video is viral on Facebook and Twitter with the caption, \"Kashmir people in flight to Rahul: Modi is doing good for us. Why do you want to visit Kashmir and trouble us. Please go back!\"\n\nThough one can hear the woman in some of the viral videos but in some other viral videos on Twitter, her voice has been tampered with.\n\nThe incident took place when a Kashmiri woman confronted Rahul Gandhi who was on-board the same flight in which the delegation of opposition leaders was returning to Delhi from Srinagar on Saturday (August 24).\n\nMany prominent media houses covered the incident. In the video, she can be heard saying, \"They are small kids, we want to see them. My brother is a heart patient, he stepped out to look for his kids, but his family member had no idea where he is for the past 10 days. We are in trouble.\"\n\nThe Congress general secretary in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Priyanka Gandhi, had also tweeted the video on Sunday.\n\nA delegation of 12 opposition leaders and Rahul Gandhi had reached Kashmir on August 24 to know the ground reality in the Valley, but, they were not allowed to move out of the Srinagar airport and were sent back to Delhi in an evening flight.\n\nThus, it is clear that the woman in the video was not asking Rahul Gandhi to go back and was narrating how the lives of people had been affected after the abrogation of Article 370 and the lockdown in the Valley.", "lang": "en"}
