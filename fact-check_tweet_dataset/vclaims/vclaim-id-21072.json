It is apparently based on speculation that the U.S. might not have been transparent in revealing details about the bomb\u2019s warhead, which allegedly contained \u201cdepleted uranium.\u201d\n\nLyon\u2019s claims, however, were fact-checked and refuted by independent analysts.\n\nAfghanistan's former President Hamid Karzai vowed to unleash a campaign to force U.S. forces out of his country for dropping the so-called \u201cmother of all bombs\u201d on Afghan soil, calling it a \u201cbarbaric\u201d act that was more aimed at testing \u201ca new weapon of mass destruction\u201d than targeting Islamic State fighters.\n\nNo civilian casualties had been reported after the blast. Officials say at least 92 IS militants killed.", "lang": "en"}
