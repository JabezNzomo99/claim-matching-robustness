Judge, according to Ford, was in the room at the time of the attack. Kavanaugh denied it happened but the other three only said they had no memory of the gathering. \u201cI do not recall the events described by Dr. Ford in her testimony before the US Senate Judiciary Committee today,\u201d Judge wrote in a letter to the committee. \u201cI never saw Brett act in the manner Dr. Ford describes.\u201d Keyser told The Washington Post that she believes Ford\u2019s account. \u201cI don\u2019t expect that P.J. and Leland would remember this evening,\u201d Ford said during her testimony. \u201cIt was a very unremarkable party.\u201d Kavanaugh\u2019s language went beyond the evidence \u2014 which is inappropriate for a judge.\n\nAnalysis: A March 18, 2003, email from Miranda to Kavanaugh \u2014 which was not released to the public until this year for Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court nomination \u2014 casts serious doubt on Kavanaugh\u2019s claim at the 2006 hearing. Miranda wrote, \u201cFor use and not distribution\u201d in the subject line and appended the full, nearly 4,000-word memo from Leahy\u2019s nominations counsel, Lisa Graves. The memo covered the Democrats\u2019 entire playbook for stumping Bush\u2019s nomination of Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Kavanaugh did not respond to this email, according to the records made public by the Senate, so it\u2019s not clear whether he saw it. But he was working hard on Estrada\u2019s nomination, and the Graves memo was a gold mine of intelligence about the other side\u2019s strategy: the kind of stuff that would have prepared Kavanaugh immensely for the Estrada fight.\n\nAnalysis: Pickering was a sitting federal judge who asked lawyers practicing in his court, including lawyers with open cases, to write letters to the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of his nomination to fill an appeals court vacancy. Asked about this ethical lapse, Kavanaugh testified at a 2006 hearing that he was not \u201cprimarily handling\u201d the nomination. He later reiterated to Feingold in response to written questions that he was not the White House lawyer \u201cassigned\u201d to Pickering\u2019s nomination. These responses were misleading. Records released for his Supreme Court nomination show that Kavanaugh was fairly consumed with the Pickering nomination even though he was not the White House lawyer with primary responsibility. He coordinated meetings about the nomination, wrote an op-ed for then-White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales about Pickering, and had a hand devising the overall strategy, among other contributions.\n\nAnalysis: Friends and former classmates have offered diametrically opposed recollections in media interviews, making it difficult to reach a final judgment. Three high school or college friends said Kavanaugh was a social drinker who never drank to excess; six college classmates said he was a stumbling, sometimes nasty drunk. At Yale, \u201cBrett was a frequent drinker, and a heavy drinker. \u2026 There are many times that he could not remember what was going on,\u201d said Charles \u201cChad\u201d Ludington, a former basketball player at Yale who said he socialized frequently with Kavanaugh while they were at that university. Ludington and two other classmates wrote an opinion article in The Washington Post saying that \u201cwe felt it our civic duty to speak the truth and say that Brett lied under oath while seeking to become a Supreme Court justice.\u201d\n\nAnalysis: Kavanaugh\u2019s responses to Durbin and Leahy about this issue were problematic. He told Durbin, \u201cI was not involved and am not involved in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatants.\u201d His answer to Leahy was slightly broader: Kavanaugh said he \u201cwas not aware of any issues\u201d regarding \u201cthe legal justifications or the policies relating to the treatment of detainees\u201d until news reports about it were published. After this hearing, The Washington Post reported in 2007 that Kavanaugh did have a role in one aspect of the Bush administration\u2019s internal debate over detainee treatment. He offered his assessment of how Justice Anthony M. Kennedy might vote on the Supreme Court if the Bush administration denied access to counsel to detainees. Since he told Leahy he \u201cwas not aware of any issues\u201d regarding \u201cpolicies relating to the treatment of detainees,\u201d and since access to legal counsel could fairly be described as a factor in the treatment of detainees, Kavanaugh\u2019s response arguably was misleading.\n\nAnalysis: Pryor had disparaged some Supreme Court rulings and once called Roe v. Wade the \u201cworst abomination in the history of constitutional law.\u201d Kavanaugh did have a role in the Pryor fight \u2014 and recommended Pryor for the appeals court to begin with \u2014 although he was not the White House lawyer with primary responsibility for the nomination. This particular response he gave Kennedy in 2004 was false, since Kavanaugh did work on the Pryor nomination personally. But Kavanaugh later told Kennedy at the same hearing that he may have attended a moot court session to prepare Pryor for his Senate confirmation hearing. In response to Kennedy\u2019s written questions, Kavanaugh clarified months later, \u201cI participated in moot court preparation for Judge Pryor.\u201d Kavanaugh also disclosed in response to Durbin\u2019s written questions in 2004 that he worked on Pryor\u2019s nomination and those of 18 other judicial nominees. He also disclosed that all White House lawyers handling nominations participated in discussions about all nominees. In sum, Kavanaugh disclosed some of the work he did in a lawyerly, guarded fashion, but omitted other relevant details.\n\nAnalysis: As general counsel of the Department of Defense, Haynes had a role devising the Bush administration\u2019s policy of torturing detainees. Kavanaugh accurately said he did not \u201chandle\u201d the Haynes nomination in the White House. Another associate White House counsel at the time was the lead on Haynes. The limited records released as part of his Supreme Court nomination show that Kavanaugh had a minor role in the Haynes nomination nonetheless. Although Durbin says Kavanaugh\u2019s response in 2006 was not accurate, Kavanaugh had stated in response to Durbin\u2019s written questions in 2004 that he had had some involvement in the Haynes nomination. Then, at the same 2006 hearing, Kavanaugh told Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) point-blank that he was involved in the Haynes nomination. Kavanaugh\u2019s responses in sum were confusing and lawyerly at several points but overall accurate.\n\nAnalysis: The lone piece of evidence that Kavanaugh might have known about this program before the Times article is an email he sent to John Yoo at the Justice Department in the days after 9/11, asking about the Fourth Amendment \u201cimplications of random/constant surveillance of phone and email conversations of non-citizens who are in the United States when the purpose of the surveillance is to prevent terrorist/criminal violence.\u201d The warrantless wiretapping program did not exist when Kavanaugh sent this email, and multiple Bush administration officials have stated on the record that Kavanaugh was not \u201cread into\u201d the Terrorist Surveillance Program once it was up and running. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, White House lawyers were sending a flurry of questions to the Justice Department to research the president\u2019s powers to combat terrorist threats. Kavanaugh\u2019s email to Yoo appears to have been part of that preliminary work.", "lang": "en"}
