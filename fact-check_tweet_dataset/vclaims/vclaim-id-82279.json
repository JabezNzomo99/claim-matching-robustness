Is this the case?\n\nIf you scroll across the Internet, or just stick \u201ctaqiyya\u201d into a Twitter search, you will stumble across many videos and articles from groups hostile to Islam arguing that \u201ctaqiyya\u201d is central to Islam and permits a Muslim to lie with impunity to nonbelievers. The argument largely stems from two parts of the Koran:\n\nEssentially, the Koran suggests that a person who faces religious persecution can withhold the identity of their faith in order to avoid bodily harm or death. The concept was particularly embraced by Shiites, who took steps to hide their religious beliefs from the majority Sunnis. (Indeed, part of the reason for Sunni distrust of Shiites is because Sunnis regard taqiyya as part of Shiite practice.)\n\n\u201cYes, it is permissible to hide the fact you are Muslim\u201d if a person is under threat, \u201cas long as it does not involve hurting another person,\u201d Abou El Fadl said. \u201cBut there is no concept that would encourage a Muslim to lie to pursue a goal. That is a complete invention. Any Muslim is raised on the idea that lying is a sin.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a dispensation within some aspects of Shia law, which was developed out of the experience of a persecuted religious minority,\u201d said Omid Safi, director of the Duke University Islamic Studies Center. \u201cIn brief, it states to value human life over declaration of faith. It is the proverbial question: If a Shia is being persecuted, and someone holds a gun to your head asking \u2018are you a Shia?\u2019 you are allowed to say \u2018no\u2019 in order to save a human life.\u201d\n\nAnother expert on Islamic law, Noah Feldman of Harvard Law School, agreed that Carson\u2019s comment was \u201cvery much oversimplified to the point of misrepresentation.\u201d As Feldman put it, \u201ctaqiyya is dissimulation when one is being oppressed or tortured or having one\u2019s views banned, a bit like Jesuit dispensation to lie under oath when your life is in danger.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf an American Muslim (or Muslim more generally) says that they want to kill Americans, we take them at face value,\u201d said Safi as an example of the Catch-22. \u201cIf an American Muslim (or Muslims more generally) says that they are committed to American democratic principles and pluralism, we state that they are of course lying, and hoping to achieve nefarious goals.\u201d\n\nHussein Ibish, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute, said that the claim made little sense because Islam is a proselytizing religion, like Christianity. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to preach it from the rooftops and the minarets\u201d in order to gain adherents, not keep the religion a secret, he said. Advocates of the alternative version of taqiyya have \u201cdragged a rather obscure and marginal concept out of the corner\u201d to make broad-brush accusations against Muslims, he said.\n\nAbou El Fadl said it \u201camazes me\u201d that although careful and balanced scholarship on Islam is being done at leading universities by scholars who have learned to read medieval Arabic texts, such research increasingly is ignored in favor of material published by \u201ccrazy ideologues, clowns and jokers\u201d who often do not know how to read Arabic.\n\nDoug Watts, a Carson campaign spokesman, declined to point to any possible sources for Carson\u2019s claim. \u201cI have scholarly sources as well, but I am not going to get into our usual back and forth on this topic,\u201d he said.", "lang": "en"}
