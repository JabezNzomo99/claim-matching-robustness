It\u2019s not an estimate of the number who would suffer from one over the course of their entire childhood. Over the course of their childhood, more children might suffer from a mental health disorder than were picked up by the study.\n\nWhat does that mean for children today?\n\nWe can\u2019t say for sure how many children and young people suffer from a mental disorder today.\n\nA more up-to-date survey is due to be published by the government in 2018. The Office for National Statistics and social researchers NatCen who will be carrying out the survey confirmed to us that this will look at children aged two to 19 years old.\n\nOne of the authors of the original report told us that it wasn\u2019t possible to predict what the findings of the next study would be, although the proportion of children with mental health disorders was unlikely to have decreased in the intervening years.\n\nMeanwhile, the Education Policy Institute says that, the \u201clack of up to date information has a serious impact on the ability of commissioners and providers to understand the current prevalence in their areas.\u201d\n\nIf the proportion of children and young people with mental disorders was still the same as in 2004, that would suggest that around 835,000 children between five and 16 have mental disorders in Great Britain.\n\nThe 2004 survey had found no change overall in the prevalence of mental disorders in children between 1999 and 2004. That said, there was a slight decrease in the proportion of boys aged five to 10 categorised as having emotional disorders such as specific phobias, anxiety or depression.\n\nMental disorders reported by the 2004 survey cover a wide range of things. They included emotional disorders, described above; conduct disorders, such as oppositional defiant disorder or socialised/unsocialised conduct disorder; and other disorders such as hyperkinetic disorders and autism.\n\nThe survey involved questioning parents, teachers and children, covering almost 8,000 families. The researchers then assessed whether or not the child had a mental disorder based on answers to these questions.\n\nBoys were more likely to have a mental disorder than girls\n\nThe 2004 survey found that over 11% of all boys interviewed had a mental disorder compared to just under 8% of girls. Across both genders, disorders were more prevalent among the 11 to 16-year-old group than those aged five to 10.\n\nThe survey also found that mental disorders were more prevalent among children with certain characteristics. This included being from: lone parent families, families where parents had no educational qualifications, or families where the weekly income was less than \u00a3100.\n\nWe don\u2019t know the reasons behind these links though. In fact, the 2004 report goes as far as to say that none of the circumstances reported should be assumed to cause mental disorders.\n\nAnother source of data backs these findings up\n\nOther figures from the Office for National Statistics found that between 2011 and 2012 one in eight children aged 10 to 15 reported that they experienced mental ill-health. This is roughly similar to the proportion of older children in the 2004 survey with mental disorders (around 12%). The ONS found that bullying and high levels of social media use were both linked to children having a higher level of mental ill-health.\n\nThe method used to calculate these figures was different from the one used in the 2004 survey. As the ONS says, they should be \u201cconsidered an indication of the prevalence of mental ill-health\u201d, rather than the last word on the subject.\n\nWe updated this piece to clarify the timeframe of the study and to include information from the ONS, NatCen and one of the authors of the original study.", "lang": "en"}
