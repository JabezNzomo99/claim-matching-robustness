The Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs has debunked the claim. Also, the website peddled as the link for checking is fake, and users risk having their information in the wrong hands.\n\nRecently, a web-link (https://npower-fmhds-gov-ng.web.app/) claimed that N-Power has shortlisted applicants for its second stage of recruitment, and that applicants can log in to check their status.\n\nIt has since gone viral on WhatsApp, as N-Power applicants and prospective applicants share the message amongst themselves.\n\nIt was also posted on a blog, MediaNgr. As of Saturday it has more than 11,000 views.\n\nBut the claim did not only turn out to be false, users could also be vulnerable to cyber attack as they risk losing their information to the site creator.\n\nN-Power is a Nigerian government social investment programme that employs young Nigerians between the ages of 18 and 35, and pays them 30,000 naira per month for two years.\n\nIn 2016, the Federal Government engaged 200,000 N-Power Volunteers. In 2017, the Federal Government enlisted 300,000 more, according to Npower website.\n\nIn June, 2020 N-Power portal was opened for registration to absorb 400,000 youths.\n\nThe commencement of the Batch C enrolment \u201cis a sequel to far-reaching consultations and a review of the submissions on the reform and realignment of the programme for greater efficiency,\u201d according to a statement from the ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management which oversees Npower.\n\nThe Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs has debunked the claim through its twitter handle.\n\nIt posted on its verified twitter handle: \u201c Please disregard, Kindly share and help us in checking these fraudulent messages.\u201d\n\nThe website currently run by Npower is \u2018NPOWER.FMHDS.GOV.NG.\u2019 On the contrary, the fake website making the claim is \u2018NPOWER-FMHDS-GOV-NG.WEB.APP.\u2019 Take note of \u2018.GOV.NG\u2019 and \u2018.WEB.APP\u2019. Also, the period (.) in the genuine website and the hyphens (-) in the fake website.\n\nFurther, the fake site asks users to send complaints or request assistance through [email protected], when in fact, Npower complaints mail is [email protected], according to the genuine website.\n\nThe website is designed to look typically like the genuine Npower website. It has all the emblems in the right colors and arrangement. However, there are only two dashboards where users are requested to type their email and phone number.\n\nBelow the dashboard by the right, the site requests unsuccessful applicants to click. On clicking, they will then be asked to type personal information such as full names, phone numbers, and Application ID.\n\nNpower did not shortlist applicants. The Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs has debunked the claim. Also, the website peddled as the link for checking the claim is fake, and users risk having their information in the wrong hands.\n\nThe researcher produced this fact-check per the Dubawa 2020 Fellowship partnership with Vision FM to facilitate the ethos of \u201ctruth\u201d in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.", "lang": "en"}
