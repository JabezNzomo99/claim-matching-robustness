While that\u2019s true based on the raw totals of COVID-19 cases and deaths, the U.S. is not the worst when adjusted for population or on other metrics.\n\u2022 The former vice president referred to the tax cuts championed by President Donald Trump as \u201cthe president\u2019s $1.3 trillion tax giveaway to the wealthiest 1% and the biggest, most profitable corporations.\u201d Although those with higher incomes reaped greater benefits from the tax law, most households received a tax cut.\n\u2022 Biden said Trump was \u201cproposing to eliminate\u201d the payroll tax that funds Social Security. The president did say he would be \u201c ending that tax,\u201d but administration officials said he meant he would forgive a recently announced payroll tax deferral.\n\u2022 Biden said, \u201cMore than 10 million people are going to lose their health insurance this year.\u201d A study did find that, but it also said most would regain insurance from another source, leaving 3.5 million of them uninsured.\n\u2022 Earlier in the night, former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg said \u201c Trump has lost 250,000 manufacturing jobs.\u201d True, but that\u2019s because of the pandemic. And not mentioned is that 192,000 were lost during the Obama-Biden years.\n\nThe Democrats wrapped up their four-day convention on Aug. 20. The Republican National Convention kicks off on Aug. 24.\n\nIn critiquing Trump on his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, Biden pointed to the U.S.\u2019s high COVID-19 caseload and death toll.\n\n\u201cJust judge this president on the facts,\u201d he said. \u201cFive million Americans infected by COVID-19. More than 170,000 Americans have died. By far the worst performance of any nation on Earth.\u201d\n\nBiden is right that in both coronavirus cases and deaths, the U.S. has the most of any other country. As of Aug. 21, America\u2019s totals stand at 5.6 million cases and more than 174,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University\u2019s COVID-19 dashboard. The next-worst nation is Brazil, with 3.5 million cases and around 112,000 deaths.\n\nBut by other metrics, the U.S. does not have the worst record. When population is factored in, seven other countries, per Oxford University\u2019s Our World in Data for Aug. 20, have more cumulative COVID-19 cases. This includes Qatar, with more than 40,000 cases per million people, and Bahrain, San Marino, Chile, Panama, Kuwait and Peru. The U.S. places eighth, with 16,706 cases per million.\n\nOn deaths per capita, the U.S. also does not fare the worst. Our World in Data shows America with the 10th-highest death rate, better than San Marino, Belgium, Peru, Andorra, Spain, the U.K., Italy, Sweden and Chile. In a similar dataset from Johns Hopkins, the U.S. does better than an additional country, Brazil.\n\nAlthough harder to interpret and heavily influenced by the number of coronavirus tests performed, the U.S. also does substantially better on its observed case-fatality rate, or the proportion of people identified with the virus who have died. In the U.S., 3.1% of those known to be infected with the virus have died \u2014 a lower rate than 55 other countries in the Johns Hopkins analysis.\n\nWhile the COVID-19 statistics for the U.S. are certainly grim \u2014 and America is by no means leading the world with its superior COVID-19 \u201cperformance\u201d \u2014 by a variety of metrics, it is not the worst.\n\nBiden referred to the tax cuts championed by Trump as \u201cthe president\u2019s $1.3 trillion tax giveaway to the wealthiest 1% and the biggest, most profitable corporations, some of which do not pay any tax at all.\u201d Although those with higher incomes reaped greater benefits from the tax law, most households received a tax cut.\n\nBiden\u2019s dig at the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \u2014 a Republican-crafted bill that the president signed into law on Dec. 22, 2017 \u2014 came as Biden highlighted a list of priorities. such as investing in infrastructure, education, child care and addressing climate change. Those are all things Biden has promised during the campaign that he could pay for, in part, by rolling back the Trump tax cuts on households making above the $400,000 threshold and raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.\n\nThe line hearkened back to one Biden used in his campaign kickoff speech on April 29, 2019, when he claimed that \u201call of\u201d the tax cuts signed into law by Trump \u201cwent to folks at the top and corporations that pay no taxes.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs we wrote then, the law provided tax cuts to those at all income levels, on average. The Tax Policy Center estimated that about 65% of households paid less in federal income tax in 2018 under the tax law than they would have paid under the old tax laws, while about 6% paid more.\n\nA higher percentage of high-income taxpayers got a tax cut, and that tax cut was, on average, greater than the tax cuts for those with lower incomes (both in dollar amounts and as a percentage of after-tax income). But 82% of middle-income earners \u2014 those with income between about $49,000 and $86,000 \u2014 received a tax cut that averaged about $1,050 in 2018, the Tax Policy Center estimated.\n\nMost of the individual income tax provisions expire after 2025, which will then shift most of the tax benefits to the top 1%. An analysis by the Tax Policy Center found that the top 1% of income earners would get 20.5% of the tax cut benefits in 2018. That percentage would go up to 25.3% in 2025 and then jump to 82.8% in 2027.\n\nAt the time it was passed, the tax law was estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation to cost $1.46 trillion over 10 years through 2027. The Tax Policy Center noted that looking at a revised 10-year window \u2014 through 2028 \u2013 the Congressional Budget Office later revised its projection, estimating the tax cuts would increase the primary deficit by $1.8 trillion. Taking into account some of the economic growth effects \u2014 what economists call dynamic estimates \u2014 the CBO projected the law would raise primary deficits by $1.3 trillion through 2028.\n\nBiden took aim at Trump by arguing that \u201cfor our seniors, Social Security is a sacred obligation, a sacred promise made\u201d and that \u201cthe current president is threatening to break that promise.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s proposing to eliminate a tax that pays for almost half the Social Security without any way of making up for that lost revenue, resulting in cuts,\u201d Biden said.\n\nTrump, for his part, has argued that \u201cSocial Security will be totally protected under me.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s comments refer to statements made by Trump this month suggesting that he wants to permanently eliminate the payroll tax that funds Social Security. Trump administration officials, on the other hand, have said that the president was referring to the permanent forgiveness of a recently announced payroll tax deferral.\n\nOn Aug. 8, Trump issued a memorandum to defer some employees\u2019 portion of the payroll tax through the end of the year. Social Security is primarily funded by that tax (including employers\u2019 portions): In 2019, the tax brought in $944.5 billion to cover Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance, or nearly 90% of its cost, according to the Social Security Administration.\n\nTrump\u2019s memo also instructed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to \u201cexplore avenues, including legislation, to eliminate the obligation to pay the taxes deferred pursuant to the implementation of this memorandum.\u201d In other words, the administration is looking for ways to potentially forgive that deferred amount \u2014 which could be upward of $100 billion, according to an estimate by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nBut Trump also indicated that he wanted to either cut or eliminate the payroll tax, permanently.\n\nIn remarks on Aug. 8, Trump said: \u201cIf I\u2019m victorious on November 3rd, I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax. So I\u2019m going to make them all permanent.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, he said: \u201cI signed directives to give a payroll tax holiday, with the understanding that after the election \u2014 on the assumption that it would be victorious for an administration that\u2019s done a great job \u2014 we will be ending that tax. We\u2019ll be terminating that tax.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials, however, said he was actually referring to forgiving the payroll taxes deferred this year.\n\n\u201cWhen he referred to permanent, I think what he was saying is that the deferral of the payroll tax to the end of the year will be made permanent. It will be forgiven. The tax is not going away,\u201d White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on CNN on Aug. 9.\n\nAnd on Aug. 13, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters: \u201cWhat he was meaning yesterday is that he wants permanent forgiveness of the deferral.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how exactly the hole left by the defacto tax cut would be covered. There are two options: The money would come out of Social Security\u2019s trust funds, or from general revenues (which would need to be approved by Congress). The trust funds are estimated to be depleted by 2035.\n\nThe Bipartisan Policy Center\u2019s William Hoagland told PolitiFact that if the payroll tax deferral costs $80 billion and came from the trust funds, it \u201cwould not gut the program,\u201d but would \u201conly impact the date of depletion, possibly a year or two earlier than expected.\u201d\n\nBiden would have a point about Trump \u201cthreatening\u201d Social Security if the president indeed plans on \u201cterminating\u201d a tax that funds the program. But it\u2019s not clear what Trump would do, and his aides say he was referring only to making a short-term tax deferral permanent \u2014 which has less of an impact on Social Security\u2019s finances.\n\nBiden went through some of the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, saying, \u201cMore than 10 million people are going to lose their health insurance this year.\u201d That figure comes from an Urban Institute study, though it\u2019s worth noting the study said most of those 10 million would regain insurance from another source.\n\nThe Urban Institute estimated the impact from job losses on those with employer-sponsored health insurance, finding that over the April-to-December time frame, 10.1 million people would lose employer-sponsored coverage. But many would switch to insurance through another family member, Medicaid or the individual market, leaving 3.5 million uninsured in the end.\n\nThe study further said that those changes would be \u201coffset somewhat by coverage transitions,\u201d namely about 500,000 people who were uninsured before the economic impacts of the coronavirus would become eligible for Medicaid and sign up for it. That would result in a net 2.9 million uninsured.\n\nOther estimates give higher figures for the uninsured. Families USA, which advocates for \u201chealth care consumers,\u201d estimated that 5.4 million laid-off workers had lost health insurance between February and May, adding that the estimate didn\u2019t include family members of those workers who also would have lost coverage.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that 26.8 million could lose employer insurance as of May 2. The vast majority of those \u2014 79% \u2014 would be eligible for subsidized coverage, either through Medicaid or tax credits to help purchase coverage on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. But it\u2019s unclear how many would enroll in such coverage. \u201cWe did not estimate take-up or enrollment in coverage options but rather only looked at eligibility for coverage,\u201d KFF said.\n\nBloomberg oversimplified, inappropriately compared apples to oranges, and misled when he said, \u201cBiden helped save 1 million auto industry jobs [but] Trump has lost 250,000 manufacturing jobs.\u201d\n\nNote first that Bloomberg compared \u201cauto industry\u201d jobs with \u201cmanufacturing\u201d jobs. They are not the same thing. The auto industry includes management, sales, service and transport jobs in addition to production-line workers. That\u2019s comparing apples to fruit salad, actually.\n\nIt may be true that 1 million \u201cauto industry\u201d jobs were saved because of the auto bailout Biden supported in 2009. The Center for Automotive Research estimated that it saved 1.5 million jobs in 2010, including those at the automakers, auto suppliers and \u201cspin-off employment\u201d in other industries. But it\u2019s a fact that despite the auto bailout, overall, 578,000 manufacturing jobs were lost during the Obama-Biden first term \u2014 and not all were regained during their final four years.\n\nAnd the fact is that manufacturing jobs increased during Trump\u2019s term \u2014 prior to the COVID-19 crisis. They also increased for much of Obama\u2019s time \u2014 but only after huge losses in his recession-plagued first years, losses that were not completely regained until after Trump took office.\n\nIt\u2019s true that there were 257,000 fewer manufacturing jobs in July than there were when the president took office. Bloomberg is right to that extent. But that\u2019s a net figure \u2014 the momentary position of a roller-coaster that is still in motion.\n\nAs of February there had been a gain of 483,000 manufacturing jobs under Trump \u2014 significantly more than the 386,000 gain during Obama\u2019s final four years. Then nearly 1.4 million of those jobs went away, at least temporarily, in March and April. Nearly half of them were regained in May, June and July.\n\nCorrection, Aug. 26: We initially said the convention ended on Aug. 21.
