Why should Democrats looking at the Democratic nomination \u2014 the process, support you instead of Bill Bradley, a friend of yours, a former colleague in the Senate? What do you have to bring to this that he doesn\u2019t necessarily bring to this process? GORE: Well, I will be \u2014 I\u2019ll be offering my vision when my campaign begins, and it\u2019ll be comprehensive and sweeping, and I hope that it\u2019ll be compelling enough to draw people toward it. I feel that it will be. But it will emerge from my dialogue with the American people. I\u2019ve traveled to every part of this country during the last six years. During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet. I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country\u2019s economic growth, environmental protection, improvements in our educational system. During a quarter century of public service, including most of it long before I came into my current job, I have worked to try to improve the quality of life in our country and in our world. And what I\u2019ve seen during that experience is an emerging future that\u2019s very exciting about which I\u2019m very optimistic and toward which I want to lead.\n\nHe does not say he \u201cinvented\u201d the Internet, but he does say something about \u201ccreating\u201d it, in the kind of awkward phrasing Gore was known for. But because the sentence was surrounded by a lot of unrelated political blather, it was largely unnoticed. CNN certainly did not highlight it in its coverage of the interview.\n\nPreliminary discussions of how the ARPANET [Advanced Research Projects Agency Network] would be designed began in 1967, and a request for proposals went out the following year. In 1969, the Defense Department commissioned the ARPANET. Gore was 21-years-old at the time. He wasn\u2019t even done with law school at Vanderbilt University. It would be eight more years before Gore would be elected to the US House of Representatives as a freshman Democrat with scant experience in passing legislation, let alone ambitious proposals. By that time, file copying \u2014 via the UUCP protocol \u2014 was beginning. Email was flourishing. The culture of the Internet was starting to develop through the Jargon File and the SF-Lovers mailing list.\n\nBut to be fair to Gore, his statement referenced what he had done in Congress. The Internet was the commercialization of the work done at DOD, and by most accounts, Gore\u2019s efforts had some impact. He was the prime sponsor of the 1991 High-Performance Computing and Communications Act, generally known as the Gore bill, which allocated $600 million for high-performance computing. Gore, who waged a two-year battle to get the bill passed, popularized the term \u201cthe Information Superhighway.\u201d\n\nMore than a year later, in an article titled \u201cThe Mother of Gore\u2019s Invention,\u201d McCullagh acknowledged: \u201cMy article never used the word \u2018invented,\u2019 but it didn\u2019t take long for Gore\u2019s claim to morph into something he never intended. The terrible irony in this exchange is that while Gore certainly didn\u2019t create the Internet, he was one of the first politicians to realize that those bearded, bespectacled researchers were busy crafting something that could, just maybe, become pretty important.\u201d\n\nDavis said she is not surprised that Gore\u2019s quote is still remembered 15 years later. \u201cA role is one of many, and doesn\u2019t ignore all the smart people who actually did the amazing technological work. In that quote he makes it a very singular accomplishment,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised a self-serving overstatement gets traction because it fits the perception the public has of politicians.\u201d\n\nThe Fact Checker did not exist back in 1999, but if it had, Gore\u2019s original statement might have earned him a couple of Pinocchios. His statement never said he \u201cinvented\u201d the Internet, but it was so self-centered that it obscured the fact that as a legislator he did help advance funding for research that helped foster the Internet. He also made the statement in the course of a television interview, and we make allowances that people sometimes misspeak on live television.
