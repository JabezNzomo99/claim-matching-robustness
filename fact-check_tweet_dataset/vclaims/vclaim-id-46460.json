Mr Khan\u2019s head has been edited onto another man, and the drugs were replaced with images of leaflets on Sharia zones.\n\nThe leaflets as seen in the image look similar to those that appeared in some parts of London in the early 2010s.\n\nIt should be noted that there are no Sharia law zones in the UK. There are Sharia councils, which have no legal jurisdiction and provide services like religious divorces and guidance.", "lang": "en"}
