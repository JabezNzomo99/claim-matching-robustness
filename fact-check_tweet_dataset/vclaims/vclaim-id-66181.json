There are also some other modern-day dedications to Sanger in the form of street signs, plaques and building names.\n\nShe was also later criticized for her work with the \"Negro Project,\" a controversial program that aimed to provide birth control services to black communities. According to a research organization at New York University specializing in Sanger, the program failed to speak with members of the black community before it was implemented and has been criticized as being racist.\n\nThat said, the project was supported by black leaders of the time, including W.E.B. Du Bois, with whom Sanger worked closely. And although the project was later criticized, Sanger presented it in a fundraising request letter as an opportunity to help \"a group notoriously underprivileged and handicapped to a large measure by a \u2018caste\u2019 system that operates as an added weight upon their efforts to get a fair share of the better things in life.\"\n\nWhat many argue as the sticking point for Sanger\u2019s white supremacy was her belief in eugenics, which as defined by Merriam-Webster is \"a science that deals with the improvement (as by control of human mating) of hereditary qualities of a race or breed.\"\n\nSanger spoke at one event for the women\u2019s affiliate of the KKK, but it was to educate those women on birth control. And this was the only event she spoke at that any sources or documents pointed to.\n\nSanger has been accused of white supremacy by many because of her belief in eugenics and her implementation of a birth control clinic in Harlem and other black communities. But historians point out this was because she wanted to share her belief in the importance of birth control with both white and black women.", "lang": "en"}
