The claim adds that the worshipers were offering a final prayer following a ruling earlier this month by India\u2019s top court that approved the construction of a Hindu temple on the holy site. The claim is false; the photo shows Muslims praying on Eid al-Adha in 2008 at the Feroz Shah Kotla mosque in New Delhi.\n\nThe photo was published here on Facebook on November 12, 2019. The post\u2019s Urdu-language caption translates to English as: \"Last prayers at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid in Ayodhya before it is handed over to the Hindus.\"\n\nBabri Masjid, or the Babri mosque, refers to the 16th century mosque that has been at the center of deadly religious strife in Ayodhya, a town in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. The mosque was destroyed by Hindus in 1992 over claims that it was built on the birthplace Rama, a Hindu god, and a previously demolished Hindu temple. Thousands of people, mostly Muslims, were killed in the subsequent unrest across India, AFP reported here.\n\nOn November 9, 2019, India\u2019s Supreme Court issued a decision in a long-running ownership dispute over the contested religious site. Here is an AFP report on the court\u2019s ruling, which awarded Hindus control over the site.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe photo was also published here, here, here and here on Facebook and here, here, here and here on Twitter alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the photo shows Muslims praying on Eid al-Adha in 2008 at Feroz Shah Kotla, a 14th century mosque in India\u2019s capital New Delhi.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the same photo was published here on December 12, 2018.
