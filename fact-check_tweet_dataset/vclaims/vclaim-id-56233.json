The claim is misleading; as of April 2020, Malaysia\u2019s coronavirus relief measures provided one-off payments as part of a means-tested financial assistance package; the measures included subsidised electricity bills for six months but did not waive them altogether.\n\nThe claim was shared over 7,800 times after it was published on Facebook here on April 5, 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Thai-language text graphic translates to English as: \u201cMalaysia gives money to everyone to combat COVID-19 at 8,000 baht [245 USD] for 6 months. They already got it. No need to pay for the electricity bills for 6 months. What about Thailand? Very selective for 5,000 baht [153 USD]?\u201d\n\nThe posts circulated after the Thai government announced that eligible workers can apply to receive 5,000 baht from a government COVID-19 relief package. Todsaphon Kritwongwiman, Secretary-General of the Social Security Office, detailed the aid in this statement broadcasted by ThaiPBS, Thailand\u2019s national broadcaster.\n\nA similar claim comparing Thailand's coronavirus relief package with Malaysia's was also published on Facebook here, here, here and here.\n\nThe claim is misleading. On March 27, 2020, the Malaysian government unveiled measures in the form of the Prihatin Rakyat Economic Stimulus Package in a bid to boost the economy during the novel coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAccording to a Ministry of Finance document, the government said it would provide financial assistance to lower income households. An estimated nine million people in Malaysia, out of a population of 31.6 million, were expected to receive the cash aid, the ministry said.\n\nThe one-off payments were capped at 1,600 Malaysian ringgit (12,000 Thai baht or 370USD) for almost four million households earning less than 4,000 Malaysian ringgit per month, as stated in this report published by Malaysian news site The Edge Markets on March 28, 2020.\n\nThe Star, an English-language newspaper in Malaysia, reported on April 6 that eligible households and individuals had started to receive assistance that week.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of The Star\u2019s article:\n\nThe Ministry of Finance document also notes that discounts would be given on electricity bills, but it does not state the fees would be waived entirely.\n\nTenaga Nasional Berhad, Malaysia\u2019s only electricity provider, said in a statement that electricity bills would be subsidised during the crisis.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Tenaga Nasional Berhad\u2019s announcement:", "lang": "en"}
