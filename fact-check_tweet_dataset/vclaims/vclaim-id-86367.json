So it was never practical to identify cases, trace their contacts, and ask exposed people to quarantine. In July 2009, the CDC advised states it was no longer necessary to report the individual cases up for aggregation \u2014 but never \u2018stopped testing.\u2019 Collecting national data was no longer important because under those circumstances, the data were not a good measure of the scale of the epidemic, nor actionable for contact tracing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbolish \u2014 in the suburbs, you\u2019re going to abolish the suburbs with this. Enforce Obama-Biden\u2019s radical AFFH \u2014 that\u2019s the AFFH regulation that threatens to strip localities of federal affordable housing funds unless they change their zoning laws to fit the federal government\u2019s demands. So what you have \u2014 I mean, I\u2019ve been watching this for years in Westchester, coming from New York. They want low-income housing built in a neighborhood. Well, I\u2019m ending that rule. I\u2019m taking it out, so \u2014 I spoke with Ben Carson the other day. We\u2019re going to be taking it out. I\u2019ve watched that whole thing go, and now they want to make it twice as bad in the suburbs \u2014 in the suburbs. Mothers aren\u2019t happy about that. Fathers aren\u2019t happy about that. They worked hard to buy a house, and now they\u2019re going to watch the housing values drop like a rock, and that has happened. It dropped like a rock. So we\u2019re not going to do that; we\u2019re going to do the exact opposite.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
