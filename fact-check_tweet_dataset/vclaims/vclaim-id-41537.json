The festivities included musical performances, displays of military equipment and flyovers by every branch of the military.\n\nDespite unpredictable weather conditions, which vacillated between humid heat and thunderstorms, the crowd stretched from the Lincoln Memorial to the Washington Monument.\n\n\u201cA great crowd of tremendous Patriots this evening, all the way back to the Washington Monument!\u201d Trump posted on Twitter.\n\nHowever, the image shared by the Facebook page TRUMP POWER does not show the Independence Day crowd. It\u2019s actually a picture taken by photographer Doug Mills for The New York Times before a pre-inauguration concert celebrating the swearing in of Obama as the 44th president in 2009.\n\nThe event, called \u201cWe Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration,\u201d took place on the National Mall in Washington D.C. on Jan. 18 of that year, with a lineup of musicians that included Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen and Stevie Wonder.\n\nTrump had a similar celebration in the days leading up to his inauguration in 2017. His inaugural concert featured musicians like country singer Toby Keith and pop rock band 3 Doors Down.", "lang": "en"}
