There are allowances for the cost of running the property - just as self-employed people get tax relief for the cost of running their business.\n\nAs much as \u00a314 billion was reportedly claimed in tax relief by landlords in 2012/13, according to a Freedom of Information request to HMRC. About \u00a36 billion of this was relief on \u2018financial costs\u2019, including mortgage interest.\n\nBut those figures are unlikely to be the same today, because there have been changes to the system in recent years.\n\nIn the Summer Budget 2015, the Chancellor announced a series of reforms to landlord tax relief which are now being implemented.\n\nLandlords used to be able to deduct 10% of their rental income from the profit they had to pay tax on, as a \u2018wear and tear allowance\u2019. This was abolished in April 2016, although they can still deduct the actual cost of replacing furnishings. And since April 2017, the amount that can be claimed as finance relief (e.g. on mortgage interest) has started to be restricted.", "lang": "en"}
