No,\u2026\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above post and found the claim to be false.\n\nWe put the image through Reverse Image Search and found the original Facebook post where the picture was shared.\n\nAhmad Effendy Zailanudin, a Malaysian Facebook user shared the picture along on March 21, 2020. In the post, he identifies the man in the picture as his cousin who is a doctor. Sharing this picture, he urged people to take care of themselves as the doctors of the country are sacrificing enough to keep the country safe.\n\n \n\n\n\nAfter the post went viral with a false narrative, Ahmad Effendy Zailanudin provided a clarification on Facebook saying that his cousin is well and on duty.\n\nWe also ran a search using keywords and found a report by daily online English language newspaper in Indonesia, Jakarta Globe. In the report, the Indonesian Doctors Association confirmed the death of six doctors including Dr. Hadio Ali in South Jakarta due to COVID-19.\n\nFrom the above information, we can conclude that even though the news of Dr. Hadio Ali is true, it has no relation whatsoever with the viral picture and hence the post is misleading and false.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
