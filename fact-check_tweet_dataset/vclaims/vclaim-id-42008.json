Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Irish sheep after drinking Viagra went on a week-long uncontrollable sex drive.

Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nIn the article link (archived) given in the post, the details about the incident can be read. When searched about the incident on Google, it can be found that even the major newspapers like Outlook India (archived), Dainik Jagran (archived) and Asianet News Hindi (archived), have published the same news. \n\n\n\nBut, it can be found in the search results that the \u2018World News Daily Report\u2019 was the first one to publish the news.

Also, the article in \u2018Outlook India\u2019 attributes the information to the \u2018World News Daily Report\u2019.\n\nIn the \u2018About\u2019 section of \u2018World News Daily Report\u2019, it can be seen that it is a satirical news website. It calls itself \u201can independent satirical media organization dedicated to covering news and events from around the world in a completely ludicrous manner\u201d.
