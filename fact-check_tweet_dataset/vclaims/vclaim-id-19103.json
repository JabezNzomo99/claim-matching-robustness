The video is being shared in light of the sudden government decision to abrogate Article 370 and thereby revoke special status granted to the state.\n\nThe viral 57-second clip has the logo of Doordarshan (DD) news and a reporter explaining how security forces are searching homes for potential terrorists and engaging with terrorists.\n\nBOOM received the video on its WhatsApp helpline number (7700906111) asking us to verify if it was true.\n\nThe video is viral on Facebook with the caption 'Live Action in Kashmir'.\n\nBOOM searched with the keywords 'Jammu and Kashmir drill dd news' on YouTube and found a longer video with scenes matching the viral video.

The fourth image in the tweet matches the house number 3 visible at the counter 50-seconds in the viral video and at 1.15 in the DD News video.\n\nBOOM also found a tweet from September 26, 2016 by the Press Information Bureau of India about Yudh Abhyas.\n\nIn a sudden move, Home Minister Amit Shah announced that Article 370 will be repealed and passed a bill bifurcating J&K into two Union Territories of Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nAlso Read: Article 370 Scrapped, Jammu and Kashmir To Be Bifurcated: What We Know\n\nAlso Read: No, This Is Not A Photo Of Pakistani Soldiers Signalling A Truce", "lang": "en"}
