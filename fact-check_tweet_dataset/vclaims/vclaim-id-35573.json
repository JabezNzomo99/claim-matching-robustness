However, the images actually show a spectacular gun show that takes place biannually in the US state of Kentucky.\n\n\u201cYPG forces destroyed 4 Turkish Humvees and two tanks, including an M1 Abrams tank,\u201d claims a video published on YouTube in English in 2018. The video has resurfaced in the aftermath of Turkey\u2019s invasion of northern Syria in early October 2019, including via this tweet in French.\n\nAt the time of the 2018 YouTube video\u2019s publication, Turkey had launched an air and ground offensive named Operation Olive Branch, against the Kurdish militia known as the People\u2019s Protection Unit (YPG).\n\nOn October 9, Turkey launched a new ground offensive in Syria following US President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that US troops stationed in the country would leave.\n\nThe thirty second video shows blurry images of sustained fire followed by a series of spectacular explosions.\n\nHowever, one detail - noticeable after increasing the video\u2019s brightness - seems to show that this is not a video shot on a battlefield. At the 20 second mark, several people on the right side of the image seem to be standing and watching, some of whom are filming the explosions with cellphones.\n\nOur colleagues from the Turkish fact-checking website Teyit, who verified the same video, mentioned in their article a similar video shot at a gun show in the southern US state of Kentucky.\n\nKeri Sumner, manager for the Knob Creek Gun Range, an open air shooting range near West Point, Kentucky, told AFP in an email that the video indeed shows an event organized on their premises twice a year, although she was not able to specify when exactly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely our night shoot we have during our machine gun shoot and military show. The cars set up down range, the timing starts and the explosive charges we have set up once someone hits the barrels of gasoline giving the large fireballs,\u201d Sumner, who is the daughter of the range owner and social media manager for the company, said.\n\nIn order to illustrate her explanation, Sumner sent AFP the image below, a screenshot of the video complete with descriptions of the different elements. Spectators behind a fence on the right, a tent for the machine gun shooters in the background, and a single shooter on the left, facing away from the camera.\n\nAn AFP photograph of this event from an April 2019, available here, gives a clearer view of the usual set up for the event, showing two tents and spectators filming with their phones.\n\nThe video claiming to show an exchange of fire in Afrin was originally posted on April 9, 2017 by a US Facebook page dedicated to firearms. The publication\u2019s author clearly identifies the images as a video of the Knob Creek Gun Range gun show.\n\nThe same scene was filmed from another angle and published on Twitter in April 2017.\n\nThe event, complete with a firearms fair, was founded in 1965. It is now one of the world\u2019s largest private gun range.\n\nHere is an October 11 AFP report on the conflict in Syria. At least 100,000 civilians have been forced to flee according to the United Nations.\n\nThis article was translated from French by Louis Baudoin-Laarman.", "lang": "en"}
