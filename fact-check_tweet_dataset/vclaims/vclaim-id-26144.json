Those who have shared this image have claimed that the van is a mortuary van, and ridiculed the Congress party for using it for its political campaign.\n\nThe above post is by a Facebook page The India Eye. It has over 1.8 million followers. This photograph was posted on August 13, 2018 and so far, it has been shared over 2600 times. The text on the image says \u0915\u093e\u0902\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u092e\u0928\u094b\u0930\u0902\u091c\u0928 \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u091f\u0940 (Congress manoranjan party) and reads \u201c\u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0915\u094b \u0932\u0942\u091f\u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u0940 \u0915\u093e\u0902\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u0915\u0947 \u092a\u093e\u0938 \u0907\u0924\u0928\u0947 \u092a\u0948\u0938\u0947 \u092d\u0940 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u091c\u094b \u0936\u0935 \u0932\u0947 \u091c\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u0940 \u0917\u093e\u0921\u0940 \u0938\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u091c\u0941\u091f\u0940 \u0939\u0948\u201d (Congress which looted the country does not even have money, they are using a mortuary van for political campaigning- translated). The photo and the accompanying message has also been shared widely on Twitter where it has been tweeted by many right-wing users.\n\nThe person who posted this tweet is followed on Twitter by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Numerous other social media users who are followed by the Prime Minister and ministers of the Central Government have shared this photograph which clearly shows \u0936\u0935 \u0935\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0928\u0940 (mortuary van) written on it.\n\nA simple Google reverse image search reveals that the photograph that is circulating on social media is photoshopped. In the original image, there is no mention of \u0936\u0935 \u0935\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0928\u0940 or mortuary van written on the vehicle. The original image was found in a report by News18of July 18, 2018, according to which the picture of Congress leader Digvijaya Singh was missing from the party\u2019s campaign launched in the state.\n\nAs can be seen in the juxtaposed images above, in the photoshopped image the words shav vahini can be seen on the vehicle which are not present in the original photo. Also, the side grill of the vehicle is missing in the photoshopped image.\n\nThis photoshopped image has been doing the rounds on social media over the past few weeks, since the Jan Jagran Yatra, a mass outreach programme of the Congress party ahead of the Madhya Pradesh assembly election was announced in July, 2018. This photoshopped image has already been debunked by Navbharat Times and Boom.\n\nWith election to the Madhya Pradesh assembly barely a few months away, hectic political campaigning is already underway on social media. Through this photoshopped image, an attempt was made to portray the Congress as a desperate party which will stoop to new lows for votes.", "lang": "en"}
