By that deadline, the Russian authorities were supposed to meet two conditions imposed by WADA\u2019s Executive Committee back in September.\n\nAlso on January 2, 16 national anti-doping organizations issued a joint statement calling on WADA to suspend Russia immediately, stating: \"Russia has failed to meet its obligations.\"\n\nRT\u2019s January 2 report used language implying that it was the World Anti-Doping Agency\u2019s own fault for not being able to access Moscow laboratory (LIMS) data, and that WADA president Craig Reedie had seemingly expressed disappointment toward his own organization.\n\nReedie actually said: \u201cI am bitterly disappointed that data extraction from the former Moscow Laboratory has not been completed by the date agreed by WADA\u2019s ExCo in September 2018.\u201d\n\nThe RT report included the quote, but several paragraphs after the misleading opening sentence of the article.\n\nWADA followed with a statement on January 2 leaving no space for doubt about who the organization blamed for the failure: \u201cWe are extremely disappointed that the Dec. 31 deadline imposed on Russia by WADA has not been adhered to by the Russian authorities.\u201d\n\nThe one condition Russia failed to fulfill was to provide WADA\u2019s five-person team of experts with full access to the raw data of the former Moscow laboratory (LIMS). The facility was sealed after playing a central role in the doping scandal that stunned Russian professional sports starting in 2014 and led to disqualifications of top Russian athletes, the loss of medals for cheating during the 2014 Olympic Games in Sochi, and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency \u2013 RUSADA -- ending up suspended by WADA.\n\nBefore sending in the team of experts, WADA representatives met on November 28 with top Russian officials regarding access to the Moscow lab. According to WADA, the parties thoroughly discussed \u201clogistics and next steps\u201d and a \u201cfull technical mission\u201d was \u201cprovisionally planned.\u201d Russia agreed that WADA\u2019s technical mission would arrive in Moscow in mid-December and the Russians would provide full access to the Moscow lab\u2019s authentic data.\n\nThe WADA mission arrived in Moscow on December 17 but had to leave empty-handed four days later after the Russian Federal Investigative Committee denied the group full access to the data and its extraction and export from Russia.\n\nThe reason given by the Russian law enforcement agency was that \u201cthe team\u2019s equipment to be used for the data extraction was required to be certified under Russian law.\u201d The issue, WADA said, \u201chad not been raised during an initial meeting on 28 November in Moscow.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe raw data is the missing piece of the puzzle that will complement the duplicate LIMS database that is already in WADA\u2019s possession and help conclude WADA\u2019s McLaren and Operation LIMS investigations,\u201d WADA said at the time, referring to the July 2016 report on the Moscow lab\u2019s data by independent Canadian expert Richard McLaren.\n\nThe preliminary report on WADA\u2019s McLaren and Operation LIMS investigations accused Russia of \u201cstate sponsored doping\u201d \u2013 an accusation the Russian officials repeatedly denied.\n\nThe consequences could be grave for the Russian sports, WADA said: \u201cRussia will be declared non-compliant. Only this action will be suitable and appropriate in the view of the athletes. Anything less will be considered a failure by WADA to act on behalf of clean athletes.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
