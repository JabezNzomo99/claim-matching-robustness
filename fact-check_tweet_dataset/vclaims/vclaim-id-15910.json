{"title": "Will Russia Really Gain Control Over Ukraine's Economy?", "subtitle": "The headline is misleading: the quoted expert actually said Russia will gain leverage over the Ukrainian economy in the area of oil, coal, and oil products, although even this is doubtful, as Ukraine has alternatives. Poland recently overtook Russia as Ukraine's largest single trading partner.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "May 16, 2019", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-15910", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/will-russia-control-ukraine-economy-fact-check/29945766.html", "vclaim": "On May 11, the headline of an article posted by the Russian state-owned media outlet RIA Novosti claimed an expert had said \u201cRussia has gained control over the Ukrainian economy.\u201d\n\nThe expert in question is Dmitry Marunich of the Kyiv-based Foundation for Energy Strategies, and RIA was quoting from comments he made in an interview with the Ukrainian outlet NewsOne:\n\n\"It is obvious that the Russian authorities have received a powerful lever of influence on the situation with deliveries and, accordingly, on the oil products market in Ukraine, with a footprint on the general state of the Ukrainian economy.\"\n\nMirroring a line from the NewsOne article preceding the quote RIA Novosti\u2019s headline suggests that Russia has gained control over Ukraine\u2019s economy. Both are inaccurate \u2013 the expert said that it had only gained powerful influence over one sector of the Ukrainian economy, albeit it is an important one. Thus, in order to fully understand why the RIA Novosti headline is deceptive, one must look at the NewsOne story it quotes, as well as the context of the interview.\n\nIn April, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev announced that he had approved a law banning all Russian oil, coal, and oil products exports to Ukraine without special permission. The ban is scheduled to go into effect on June 1. In the NewsOne interview, Marunich expressed doubt that exports will be cut off.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t predict a cessation of imports of petroleum products from the Russian Federation,\u201d he told NewsOne. \u201cAs far as I know, a large Russian company, Rosneft, has already received permission for supplies inside Ukraine. Therefore, in all probability, there will be no cessation of supplies from June 1.\u201d\n\nThe quote used by RIA Novosti about Russia gaining leverage over Ukraine\u2019s economy came elsewhere in Marunich\u2019s NewsOne interview.\n\nSo what is the prognosis for Ukraine should Russia decide to cut off oil and coal exports to Ukraine? Back in April, Ukraine Business News reported that Ukraine\u2019s Oil and Gas Association announced that it could meet the country\u2019s oil and gas needs from other countries. UBN quoted representatives of the association as saying that Ukraine\u2019s supply was more diversified than some European nations.\n\n\u201cStarting in 2017, fuel comes to Ukraine from more than 10 countries using all sorts of logistics \u2013 maritime, rail, road and pipeline, which allows organizing any deliveries in a short time,\u201d the representatives stated, although they did allow for slightly higher prices at gas pumps.\n\nCoal is another matter. Ukraine produces coal, but part of its main coal-mining territory is under the control of Russia\u2019s proxies in the Donbas. In 2017, protests organized by Ukrainian war veterans compelled the government to stop buying coal from these territories. However, there has been suspicions that Ukraine continued to buy the coal using Belarus as an intermediary. Ukraine also sought to import coal from the United States in 2018.\n\nRussia\u2019s influence over other sectors of Ukraine\u2019s economy has dropped since 2014. On May 12, Business News Europe reported that Poland had surpassed Russia as Ukraine\u2019s main trading partner. Additionally, BNE, citing the State Statics Service of Ukraine, showed trade with Russia stood at 7.3% of the total in February 2018, dropping to 6.0% by February 2019. Earlier this year, BNE reported that restrictive quotas on certain exports remain a barrier still holding back Ukraine\u2019s trade with the EU. It stands to reason that without these restrictions, Ukraine-EU trade, which has been larger than Ukraine\u2019s trade with Russia for some time, would likely grow even more.\n\nIt is unclear whether Russia\u2019s energy embargo on Ukraine will be as powerful a lever as Dmitry Marunich predicts after and if it goes into effect on June 1. What is clear, however, is that RIA Novosti\u2019s headline proclaiming Russia\u2019s \u201ccontrol\u201d over Ukraine\u2019s economy is misleading.", "lang": "en"}
