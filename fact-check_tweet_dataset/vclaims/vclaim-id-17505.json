Biko, a founder of South Africa\u2019s\n\nThe quote claims that when Biko was asked about Mandela\u2019s\n\n, he said: \u201cApartheid doesn\u2019t keep you alive unless it\u2019s going to use you later.\u201d\n\nof 1963 and 1964, Mandela faced the real possibility of a death sentence. Instead, he got life in prison.\n\nBut is there evidence that the quote is by Biko?\n\nQuote not in Biko's writings\n\nThere is no date or source for the quote. There is also no indication of who asked Biko the question.\n\nThando Sipuye, a historian and programme officer at the\n\n, believes the quote is fake. The community development organisation runs a\n\nthat educates the public about Biko\u2019s life and his contribution to freedom and democracy.\n\nSipuye told Africa Check that the quote does not appear anywhere in Biko\u2019s writings.\n\n\u2018Mandela will always have a place of honour\u2019\n\nBiko only mentions Mandela once in\n\n, a collection of his essays first published in 1978.\n\n, Biko writes: \u201cPeople like Mandela, [Robert] Sobukwe, [Ahmed] Kathrada, MD Naidoo and many others will always have a place of honour in our minds as the true leaders of the people.\n\n\u201cThey may have been branded communists, saboteurs, or similar names \u2013 in fact they may have been convicted of similar offences in law courts but this does not subtract from the real essence of their worth.\n\n\u201cThese were people who acted with a dedication unparalleled in modern times. Their concern with our plight as black people made them gain the natural support of the mass of black people. We may disagree with some things they did but know that they spoke the language of the people.\u201d\n\nNkosinathi Biko, Biko\u2019s son and a foundation board member, told Africa Check he believes the quote is fake.\n\n\u201cThere's actually been no reference in Steve Biko\u2019s work of any such. Even his own experiences don\u2019t tell you that. So as far as we are concerned it\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nMacqueen is the author of\n\na \u201cwide-ranging account of the movement and ideology of Black Consciousness in relation to other resistance movements in South Africa\u201d.\n\nMacqueen said the quote ran against\n\nBiko's sentiments about Mandela, as expressed in I Write What I Like.\n\n\u201cIn addition, it attributes an unrealistic prescience of judgement to Biko, who had no way of knowing that Mandela would be released or even survive imprisonment.\"", "lang": "en"}
