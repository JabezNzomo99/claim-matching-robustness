No, that's not true: the fake quote has been pushed several times by several sites that are part of the same network of Macedonian fake news websites but it is misattributed. Hackman didn't say it.\n\nThe quote recently went viral again through an article published on November 30, 2018 titled \"HOLLYWOOD LEGEND GENE HACKMAN: 'DONALD TRUMP COULD EASILY TURN OUT TO BE ONE OF THE BEST PRESIDENTS THAT AMERICA HAS EVER SEEN. - coolinfo24.com\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nIt seems like Donald Trump has a real back up. Not long ago Gene Hackman, while being interviewed stated something truly important about our leader. He initially described how he met the current president of the United States: Well I have met Donald Trump back in the 80's, he was a guest at my party in New York.\" \"We discussed and he really seemed like a decent guy, in fact i liked him.\" He also added that when he heard Donald Trump is going to be the Republican candidate for the election he was truly shocked.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nHowever the quote in question was not spoken by Gene Hackman but by now deceased club tycoon Peter Stringfellow, as can be seen in this article:\n\nThe website of Stringfellows has more details:\n\nYes - I have met Donald Trump - back in the 80s, Gene Hackman threw a party at my club in New York, and Donald was a guest. So what do I think about Trump? It is possible he could turn out to the be one the best presidents that America has ever seen...\n\nIn other words, Stringfellows met Trump at a party thrown by Hackman and then gave his opinion on Trump.\n\nThe quote was ripped out of context, misunderstood or deliberately altered by someone and then it ended up being endlessly recycled by a network of Macedonian fake news websites.\n\nYou can read all about the network here in this recent article we published:\n\nWe wrote about coolinfo24.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Civil War Did NOT Erupt In Sweden; Irate Swedes Did NOT Burn Nine Muslim Refugee Centers to the Ground (Again...)", "lang": "en"}
