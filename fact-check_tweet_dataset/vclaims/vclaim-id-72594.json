They were never examined after they got here and quarantined if they had a disease. They were just sent out across the country. Many of them had measles.\"\n\nOther conservative voices have linked measles to illegal immigrants. The conservative website wrote about Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., who said the disease was brought into the country by \"illegal aliens.\"\n\nThe common thread in these statements is the idea that these children were never examined, that they had measles, and Washington took no precautions before allowing them to stay.\n\nNone of that holds up, however.\n\nIn fiscal year , over 68,000 unaccompanied minors presented themselves at the border. The crisis spurred a flurry of activity, largely by two government agencies, the departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services. Homeland Security set up new processing centers and HHS\u2019s Office of Refugee Resettlement looked after the children until their fates were resolved.\n\nContrary to Limbaugh\u2019s assertion, the federal government did examine these kids. The , according to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, was to provide \"vaccinations to all children who do not have documentation of previous valid doses of vaccine.\"\n\nLimbaugh also claimed that these children were never quarantined if they had a disease. The reverse is true.\n\n\"Children receive additional, more thorough medical screening and vaccinations at ORR shelter facilities,\" according to the refugee resettlement Web page. \"If children are found to have certain communicable diseases, they are separated from other children and treated as needed.\"\n\nFurther undermining Limbaugh\u2019s case (we reached out to his show and did not hear back) are the vaccination rates for the key countries involved in the influx of unaccompanied minors -- El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico.\n\nThe latest data from the runs through 2013. As this table shows, over the past four years, the vaccination rates among those countries are on par or exceed the rate in the United States.\n\nWith vaccination rates this high, epidemiologists say there is no particular reason to point to children from these countries as the source of a measles outbreak.\n\nWhat we know about the outbreak\n\nAs a final point, the information on the measles cases this year reported to health departments fails to suggest a link to immigrant children.\n\nThe said that most of the 102 cases stem from exposures at Disneyland in California. California health officials report that emerged directly or indirectly from the amusement park. The core group was made up of 40 people who worked at or visited the park. Neither the CDC nor the California Department of Health have traced the outbreak to one of the young people who entered the country last year.\n\nIn fact, assistant surgeon general Anne Schuchat said in a that \"we assume that someone got infected overseas, visited the parks and spread the disease to others.\"\n\nPast measles outbreaks have not been linked to Central America. Last year, Ohio saw 382 measles cases. According to , that began when unvaccinated travelers came back from the Philippines and spread the disease within the local Amish community. The CDC said nearly 80 percent of the cases that year were among people who chose not to be vaccinated due to their religious beliefs.\n\nLimbaugh pinned the current measles outbreak on the Central American children who flooded the southern border in 2014. Limbaugh said they were never examined and that many had measles.\n\nLimbaugh provided no evidence that this is true. Probably, because no evidence exists. The children who came in from Central America were examined and vaccinated as part of a standard routine.\n\nThere is no data that links this or any other outbreak of measles to those immigrants, who are vaccinated at about the same rate as Americans.\n\nThis claim lacks any basis in fact.
