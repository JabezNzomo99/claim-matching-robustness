Titled \u2018Modi destroying termite ridden old Banyan tree\u2019, the write-up is critical of the Nehru dynasty, calling it a \u201ctermite ridden old Banyan tree which will still try its best to stop any one growing to the extent that it may even turn the soil upside down before falling down\u201d. The write-up cautions against the lingering \u2018old order\u2019 and how it will do anything and everything in its power to preserve the status quo and prevent positive change.\n\nThe full text of the write-up, which apparently appears in Tully\u2019s book \u2018No Full Stops in India\u2019, is pasted below. Tully was the bureau chief of BBC, New Delhi. He started his career in 1965 as the India correspondent for the global broadcaster.\n\nMark Tully the BBC correspondent for India for many decades writes about changes happening in MODI\u2019S regime.\n\nIn his Book \u201cNo Full Stops in India,\u201d while discussing about change writes \u2013\n\nIn India change takes a lot more time.The birth will be slow and perhaps painful. I believe it could be the birth of a new order which is not held up by the crumbling colonial pillars left behind by the Raj but is GENUINELY Indian ; a GC modern order, but \u201dnot a slavish imitation of other modern orders\u201d.\n\nHe goes on to say that \u2013 \u201cFor all its great achievements, the Nehru dynasty has stood like a Banyan tree, overshadowing the people and the institutions of India, and all Indians know that nothing grows under the Banyan tree\u201d.\n\nAs Mark said , Change will be slow and painful, therefore for someone who doesn\u2019t read and makes judgement based on perception will for quite some time not be able to see the change taking place or will pretend as if nothing is changing.\n\nThe way changes are coming in Railways, Power sector, Defense Production and in governance and at the same time accompanied by the resentment of the old forces indicate that the process of change has begun albeit slowly but firmly and is going to be painful.\n\nLet us not undermine the capabilities of this termite ridden old Banyan tree which will still try its best to stop any one growing to the extent that it may even turn the soil upside down before falling down.\n\nFor a year or so we may witness more of Dadris, more of Kaniyahas, more of Owaisi style shouting but finally if the Society keeps its cool, acts maturely and continues to perform we will sail through and the old forces will die a natural death.\n\nLET ME ADD to this \u2013 every day the new stir media throws in your face is all doctored by forces who wish to topple Modi Govt as Modi has uprooted them and they are like fish out of the water.\n\nThe time has come to continue to support the man and keep your faith intact and we will see new India for sure \u2013 bigger, better, stronger, corruption free , peaceful , prosperous than ever before with people having better quality of life..\n\n\u2013 Mark Tully.\n\nThe write-up has been shared by several individual users on Facebook. It has also been posted on Twitter.\n\nNo such passage in the book\n\nAlt News discovered that the write-up ascribed to Mark Tully is to be found nowhere in his book \u2018No Full Stops in India\u2019. We then contacted Mark Tully who confirmed that this so called article/passage is fake. \u201cIt is a rehash of an older fake which has been in circulation for years now. I would be enormously grateful for anything you can do to make it known the so called article allegedly by me is a fake\u201d, Tully wrote in an email to Alt News.\n\nThis is not the first time that Mark Tully\u2019s name has been used to further an agenda in the form of an article/write-up/passage. Earlier in July 2018, when the Congress party had introduced a no-confidence motion in the Lok Sabha, an \u2018article\u2019 critical of the Gandhi family, and falsely attributed to Tully, was circulated widely.", "lang": "en"}
