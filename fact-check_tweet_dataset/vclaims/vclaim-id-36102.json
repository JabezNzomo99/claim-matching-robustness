It has in fact been circulating since April, including with a Turkish caption that alleges the same.\n\nA Pakistani handle had uploaded the video on the website dailymotion.comin October 2015. This was also uploaded with a similar claim \u2013 \u201cIndians caught an old man wit cow and see what they did.\u201d However, the dialect spoken by the people in the video did not sound akin to any Indian languages or neighbouring countries in the north.\n\nAlt News contacted Lisa Fuller, a journalist who reports on conflict and human rights in Sri Lanka. She informed that the people in the video are conversing in Sinhalese. The man was not force-fed cow urine or alcohol but was given water when he asked for the same. \u201cHe had stolen a cow. When asked why he did so, the man replied that he didn\u2019t have anything to eat,\u201d said Fuller.\n\nFuller also sent us the same clip uploaded by a YouTube user in April 2015 who described it as \u2013 \u201cMuslim Stole Cow in Sri Lanka.\u201d This was a longer version of the 30-second video shared on social media. As evident from the footage, the man wasn\u2019t force-fed as he does not resist or stop the person from making him drink the water.\n\nThe incident was reported by Sri Lankan portals Hiru Newsand Sri Lanka Muslims.According to the latter, the man was caught by villagers in Maraluwawa, Wellawa in Kurunegala, tied to a tree and later handed over to the police.\n\nA video of a man tied to a tree by villagers in Sri Lanka for stealing a cow was shared to claim that a Muslim man was made to forcefully drink cow urine and alcohol in India. Earlier in March, we had debunked another video from Sri Lanka, a case of ragging, which was shared in the Pakistani social media ecosystem as boys throwing water on Muslim girls in India.", "lang": "en"}
