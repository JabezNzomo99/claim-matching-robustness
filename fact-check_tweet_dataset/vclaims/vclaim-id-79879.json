The story was first published as satire.\n\nNASCAR announced on June 10 that the Confederate flag would be prohibited from its events and properties. The post, dated July 28, alleges NASCAR has been forced to file for bankruptcy due to \u201cconservative boycotts\u201d over the move.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have stepped on their rights. It\u2019s that simple,\u201d Joe Barron, the alleged NASCAR spokesperson, is quoted as saying in a statement. \u201cWe made a bad choice and we are deeply sorry. We underestimated the power of a conservative boycott and we now realize we have to listen to this large portion of the population who have been silenced for too long.\u201d\n\nThe supposed spokesperson goes on to announce that NASCAR is \u201creversing the flag ban\u201d and that the series is \u201churting for cash.\u201d (RELATED: Did Trump Tweet That The Confederate Flag Is A \u2018Symbol Of Love\u2019?)\n\nHowever, NASCAR does not appear to have actually filed for bankruptcy. Had it done so, it would have been picked up by major media outlets, yet none have reported on it. NASCAR also doesn\u2019t mention a bankruptcy filing or a reversal of its Confederate flag ban on its website or in its social media posts.\n\nThe Facebook post\u2019s text lifts word-for-word from an article on Bustatroll.org, a parody news website that describes itself as belonging to a network that publishes \u201cparody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d Barron, a fictional character, often appears in satirical articles from Bustatroll and other websites in the satire network.\n\nThough Bustatroll states that \u201ceverything on this website is fiction,\u201d its articles often get posted elsewhere without a disclaimer about the satirical origins of the content, a common way misinformation spreads online.", "lang": "en"}
