Bernie Sanders \u201chelped turn neighborhoods like ours into a toxic waste dumping ground.\u201d Sanders did support a bill that could have resulted in nuclear waste being placed near a poor, minority town in Texas, but the state ultimately rejected that location.\n\nAs a member of the House in 1997, Bernie Sanders co-sponsored a bill that created a compact between Texas, Maine and his home state of Vermont to allow for the two Northeastern states to transport low-level radioactive waste to Texas for disposal.\n\nThe site initially eyed for disposal was just outside Sierra Blanca, a small, mostly Hispanic, poor town on the U.S.-Mexico border. The proposal prompted protest by environmental activists and some members of Congress \u2014 and, years later, it became a line of attack against Sanders\u2019 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns.\n\nBut a short ad on Facebook attacking Sanders on the issue ahead of the South Carolina Democratic primary omits context and misleads in its quick retelling of the matter.\n\nThe ad, 15 seconds in length and posted by the Big Tent Project, a group spending hundreds of thousands to oppose Sanders, erroneously leaves the impression that the town at the center of the case was indeed used for the nuclear waste disposal.\n\n\u201cBernie Sanders\u2019 Vermont: Clear and clean,\u201d the narrator says. \u201cBecause of his bill to send nuclear waste to minority communities, he helped turn neighborhoods like ours into a toxic-waste dumping ground. But on Saturday, you get a chance to clean this up. Say no to Bernie Sanders.\u201d\n\nA citation on screen cites a 2016 Daily Kos story about the Sierra Blanca case.\n\nIn reality, a Texas environmental commission ultimately rejected the Sierra Blanca site and another location was later selected. The ad is being pushed in South Carolina before its Democratic primary Feb. 29 and comes ahead of the March 3 Super Tuesday contests, which include Texas.\n\nSome background: Legislation passed by Congress in the 1980s gave states the ability to select sites for disposing low-level radioactive waste \u2014 such as waste \u201cgenerated by nuclear power plants, industry, hospitals\u201d \u2014 and encouraged them to form multi-state compacts to manage the waste. Today, most states in the country are part of such a compact, according to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, though the Texas facility is the only new dump opened since the 1980s compact legislation was passed.\n\nIn Texas, the Sierra Blanca site was chosen by a state authority and was pursued despite objections by residents and concerns by environmental groups. Some in Congress forcefully rejected the compact because of the expected location at the time, too.\n\nDemocratic Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett, for example, said the site \u201cwas chosen because it was perceived that the people of Sierra Blanca lack the political power to be able to do something to protect their neighborhood; that it was okay to take this garbage from across the United States and put it into a poor neighborhood that would not be able to resist.\u201d Likewise, Democratic Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota said, \u201cThis is a fight for communities all across the country who do not have the political clout to keep this pollution out.\u201d\n\nWhile Sanders\u2019 team has previously pointed out that the legislation supported by Sanders didn\u2019t name the Sierra Blanca site specifically, as Snopes reported in 2018, the planned location was widely known when the legislation was before Congress.\n\nSpeaking in the House in 1997 and 1998, Sanders said he opposed nuclear power but supported the measure as the \u201csafest way of disposing of low-level radioactive waste\u201d and cited support from Democrats and Republicans in the three states.\n\nSanders in 1998: \u201cIf I had my druthers, I would close down every nuclear power plant in America as quickly as we safely can. But the issue today is something different. The reality is, we have nuclear power plants. We have universities and hospitals that are using nuclear power. The environmental question today, therefore, is how do we get rid of that low-level waste in the safest possible way? In my view, that is what this legislation is about. I think the evidence is pretty clear that Texas is in fact the best location to get rid of this waste. The last point that I would make is there is nowhere in this legislation that talks about a specific site. Nowhere will we find that. We are not voting on a site. That decision is left to the authorities and the people of the State of Texas.\u201d\n\nAsked about the issue now, a Sanders campaign spokesman pointed us to a statement from his 2016 campaign that said: \u201cWe were assured that regulators would not pick a site that would be harmful to the environment or local communities in Texas. That\u2019s exactly what happened. The good news is that the Sierra Blanca site was rejected and none of this nuclear waste was ever sent there. That was the right decision to make. There is no question that there was a real environmental justice aspect to the Sierra Blanca site.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that a majority of both Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate voted in favor of the compact. It\u2019s also worth noting, in the context of the 2020 election, that former Vice President Joe Biden, then a senator, was among those who did, too.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton signed the compact into law in September 1998. The next month, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission rejected the Sierra Blanca site. Maine subsequently dropped out of the compact.\n\nSeveral years later, Waste Control Specialists applied to open a disposal facility in Andrews, Texas, located near the New Mexico-Texas border and more than 200 miles away from Sierra Blanca.\n\nJust as it didn\u2019t technically vote on the Sierra Blanca site, Congress didn\u2019t have a say on that eventual location. Voters in Andrews County, Texas \u2014 very narrowly \u2014 opted in 2009 to approve bonds for the company to build the facility.\n\nOperating since 2012, the Waste Control Specialists site is one of four active disposal sites in the country (another is in South Carolina), according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In addition to accepting waste from Vermont, the facility can also accept \u201cup to 30%\u201d of its disposal capacity from other states.\n\nThe bill creating the compact supported by Sanders also created an administrative board, the Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact Commission. Some \u2014 including another Big Tent ad \u2014 have criticized the fact that Sanders\u2019 wife served on the commission and got paid for it. Tax returns posted by the Sanders campaign show Jane Sanders collected $8,475 in 2013 for her role and $4,900 in 2014. She is no longer named on the commission\u2019s website, but was listed as an alternate commissioner as recently as December 2018. Her LinkedIn profile lists her as having served from 2012 to 2015.\n\nSanders critics are likely to continue their attacks over his approval of the compact despite the concerns over Sierra Blanca, but it ignores necessary context and misleads voters to simply claim he \u201chelped turn neighborhoods like ours into a toxic-waste dumping ground.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
