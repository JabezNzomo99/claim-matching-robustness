The difference was that \u201cDurga Asthami\u201d had been replaced by \u201cNavratri\u201d. In her original tweet, she had also not mentioned \u201cInshah Allah\u201d. Additionally, the post added the part where she supposedly prays to \u201cAllah\u201d, whereas she had said nothing of this sort in her tweet. Shabana Azmi completely refuted these posts, stating that she \u201cNEVER said this\u201d. But, on going through her actual tweet and the viral post, it is clear that the crux of both the tweets are the same, with inflammatory details added.\n\nIt is true that Kangana and Shabana have butted heads in the past, but there have been no episodes in the nature of this viral post.\n\n\n\nIn February this year, Ranaut called the veteran actor \u201canti-national\u201d. This was a remark over the latter\u2019s decision to cancel her visit to the Karachi Art Council for a two-day literature conference after the horrific Pulwama terror attacks, reported India Today. Kangana had said,\"People like Shabana Azmi calling for halt on cultural exchange \u2013 they are the ones who promote Bharat Tere Tukde Honge gangs... why did they organise an event in Karachi in the first place when Pakistani artistes have been banned after Uri attacks? And now they are trying to save face?\"", "lang": "en"}
