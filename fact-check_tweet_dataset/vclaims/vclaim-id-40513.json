(RELATED: Did Winston Churchill Say, \u2018A Lie Gets Halfway Around The World Before The Truth Has A Chance To Get Its Pants On\u2019?)\n\nTim Riley, chief curator at the National Churchill Museum, agreed: the quote can\u2019t be attributed to the statesman, but it does have a churchillian ring to it. Riley pointed to a 1954 speech Churchill gave at Guildhall in London. \u201cFor myself I am an optimist \u2013 it does not seem to be much use being anything else,\u201d he told the audience.\n\nThe saying has been attributed to Churchill since at least 2003, according to the website Quote Investigator.", "lang": "en"}
