Let\u2019s try to check the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Image of Police brutality on students during the recent \u2018JNU fee hike\u2019 protests. Fact: The image shows policeman beating a demonstrator during the protests against gang-rape of a woman in New Delhi in December 2012. So, it is in no way related to the recent protests against \u2018JNU fee hike\u2019 and the claim is FALSE.\n\nFrom the article of \u2018The Hindu\u2019, it can be found that, since the past few days, students of JNU are protesting demanding the withdrawal of draft hostel manual and proposed hike in the hostel fees. \n\n\n\nWhen the image in the post is subjected to Google reverse image search technique, many search results were obtained. Among them, the search result of \u2018Hindustan Times\u2019 had the same image in its article about protests against gang-rape of a woman in New Delhi in December 2012. The same image can be also found in the \u2018Reuters\u2019 photo stock with the following description \u2013 \u2018A policeman wields his baton against a demonstrator near the presidential palace during a protest rally in New Delhi December 22, 2012. Indian police used batons, tear gas and water cannon to turn back thousands of people marching on the presidential palace on Saturday in intensifying protests against the gang-rape of a woman on the streets and on social media\u2019.\n\nTo conclude, the image in the post isn\u2019t related to the recent \u2018JNU fee hike\u2019 protests. It is related to protests against the gang-rape of a woman in New Delhi in December 2012. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
