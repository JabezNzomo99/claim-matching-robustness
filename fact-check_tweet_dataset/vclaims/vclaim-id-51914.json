Zakharova said she was aware of the decision and complained about \u201cdouble standards.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, we have long had questions regarding what the United States is guided by in including or not including certain organizations on its \u2018blacklists\u2019 [of terrorist organizations],\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAs you know, Washington has long refused to add the ISIS group to them. But I think it would have been worth looking at that. But Washington calculated that this structure might possibly be useful for fighting the legitimate Syrian authorities.\u201d\n\nThe United States added the Islamic State group to its list of terrorist organizations on Dec. 17, 2004. At that time, the group had just become known as \u201cAl-Qaeda in Iraq,\u201d after the founder Abu Musab al-Zarqawi received permission to be an affiliate in Iraq. Al-Qaeda was added to the State Department\u2019s list in 1999.\n\nEven before the 2004 designation, U.S. forces in Iraq were fighting the group and its predecessor, Jamaat al-Tawhid wal Jihad (The Organization of Monotheism and Jihad). By the time the Syrian uprising began in 2011, the Islamic State group had already been on the U.S. list of terrorist organizations for nearly seven years.\n\nZakharova\u2019s suggestion that the United States saw Islamic State as an enemy of the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria ignores history. From 2010 up to its resurgence in the summer of 2014, the group had been all but defeated by U.S. and Iraqi forces.\n\nAl-Zarqawi was killed in a U.S. raid in 2006. In 2010, another U.S.-led raid killed two subsequent leaders of the group \u2013 Abu Ayuub al-Masri and Abu Omar al-Baghdadi.\n\nIn September 2014, after Islamic State rebounded and seized territory in Iraq and Syria, the U.S. formed a global coalition of dozens of countries to defeat it. The coalition still operates and has 82 members.\n\nIn Syria, the United States trained and equipped various groups to fight against ISIS, with mixed results. However, support for the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces led to the destruction of Islamic State\u2019s so-called \"caliphate\" in Syria, including its self-proclaimed capital of Raqqa, from 2017 through 2018.\n\nZakharova's remarks came two days after the U.S. State Department said it had added the white-supremacist Russian Imperial Movement to its terrorist list.\n\nThe group\u2019s leaders, Stalnislav Vorobyev, Denis Gariyev, and Nikolai Trushchalov, were accused of \u201cproviding training for acts of terrorism that threaten the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and being leaders of such a group.\u201d\n\n\u201cRIM has provided paramilitary-style training to white supremacists and neo-Nazis in Europe and actively works to rally these types of groups into a common front against their perceived enemies,\u201d the State Department charged. \u201cRIM has two training facilities in St. Petersburg, which are likely being used for woodland and urban assault, tactical weapons, and hand-to-hand combat training.\u201d\n\nThe State Department also accused the group of providing training to two Swedish far-right individuals who \u201ccommitted a series of bombings in Gothenburg, Sweden, targeting a refugee shelter, a shelter for asylum seekers, and a caf\u00e9, for which they were convicted in Sweden.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Russian Imperial Movement have fought in the ranks of Russian-led forces in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region, and one member was later said to have died in the civil war in Libya, where Russian mercenaries have been spotted.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, the Russian Imperial Movement is the first white supremacist group to be added to the U.S. terror list. The group is not sponsored by the Russian government, but its activities have been tolerated, the Times said.", "lang": "en"}
