Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Mob protesting with sticks in the streets of Kerala. Fact: The photo was taken in 2013 during a protest in Dhaka demanding new blasphemy law. So the photo has nothing to do with any incident in Kerala. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen we subjected the photo to reverse image search technique, a tweet with that photo was found. The tweet was made by \u2018Taslima Nasreen\u2019 and she mentioned that the photo belonged to Bangladesh.\n\nTaking it as a clue, when we searched using keywords, a similar photo of a mob holding sticks in their hands was found. As per the description, the photo is of a protest in Dhaka in 2013 demanding a new blasphemy law. When we looked for news reports about the protest, an article of \u2018Daily Mail\u2019 was found. In the article, it is mentioned that thousands of Islamists had taken to streets in Dhaka demanding new blasphemy law in the country. It was also reported that activists of \u2018Hefajat-e-Islam\u2019 group have blocked several roads in Dhaka during the protests.\n\nWith the above information, when we searched with keywords on \u2018Alamy\u2019 photo stock, a similar photo the one posted but taken from a different angle was found. Another similar photo taken from a different angle can be seen here.\n\n\u2018The Quint\u2019 has also debunked this claim earlier which can be read here.\n\nTo sum it up, photo captured during a protest in Bangladesh in 2013 is shared as the one from Kerala.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
