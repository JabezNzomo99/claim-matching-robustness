The site was created in March 2012 by U.S. marine veteran Paul Szoldra. It is considered as \"the military version of The Onion.\n\nThe website features in Wikipedia's list of satirical websites.\n\nUS fact-checking website Snopes has a page to archive its factchecks on stories from Duffel Blog.\n\nThe humanoid Sophia is a creation of Hong Kong-based Hanson Robotics, lead by AI developer and robotics entrepreneur David Hanson, a former Disney Imagineer. The humanoid was designed to look like Audrey Hepburn.\n\nIn the video above Sophia can be seen and heard speaking in a female voice and expressing human emotions.\n\nSophia was bestowed upon citizenship in Riyadh on October 25th when she was unveiled at a technology conference in the capital Riyadh. The robot appeared as part of the Future Investment Initiative summit to drive investment from Saudi Arabia into artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile details of Sophia's citizenship are not entirely clear, it has upset women in the Sunni Muslim kingdom, who feel that the robot enjoys more rights than them as she does not need a male guardian or have to cover her head in public.
