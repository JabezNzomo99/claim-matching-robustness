Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said his country would do \u201cwhat is in our national interest.\u201d\n\nAmid the S-400 procurement controversy, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited India on June 25-26.\n\nThe national Turkish broadcaster TRT reported, citing Indian media, reported that State Department officials had previously urged \u201callies and partners, including India, to forgo transactions with Russia that risk triggering the CAATSA (Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act).\u201d\n\nCAATSA calls for sanctions against countries engaged in \u201ctransactions with the intelligence or defense sector of the government of the Russian Federation.\u201d\n\nCoinciding with Pompeo\u2019s visit, the retired vice chief of the Indian Air Force, Air Vice Marshall Kapil Kak, was quoted by Turkey\u2019s Anadola News Agency on June 26 that \u201cthe S-400 is perhaps the best air defense system in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy calculation is that the S-400 is superior to any other system. It also depends on the specific Patriot that\u2019s on offer,\u201d Kak aid. \u201cFor the S-400, we know exactly what it means. We\u2019re not sure when Americans tell us about [the Patriot missile defense system]. They were used in the Gulf War and subsequently upgraded. Various tests done later don\u2019t make them superior. I don\u2019t think they will either interest Turkey or India. That\u2019s my belief.\u201d\n\nKak is not alone in preferring the S-400 to similar air defense systems.\n\nSameer Ali Khan, a visiting fellow at Atlantic Council\u2019s South Asia Center, said the S-400 is a cut above the US Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systems.\n\n\u201cThe S-400 surface-to-air missile defense system is a formidable capability that can strike aerial targets at ranges up to 400 km and ballistic missiles at ranges of up to 15 km,\u201d Khan said. \u201cThe available alternatives\u2014PAC-3 and THAAD\u2014do not compare in terms of capabilities. Unlike the S-400\u2019s 40N6 (400 km) interceptors, PAC-3 can only intercept aerial targets at a range of 180 km and ballistic missiles at a range of 100 km. THAAD, on the other hand, is strictly an anti-missile weapon system and cannot intercept aircraft.\u201d\n\nSiemon Wezeman, a senior researcher for the Arms and Military Expenditure Program at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), told Polygraph.info that the superiority of any given air defense system depends on the type of defense being considered.\n\n\u201cPatriot is offered as the weapon against aircraft, cruise missiles and shorter-range ballistic missiles (as currently used against Saudi Arabia). For defense against longer-range ballistic missiles, the USA offers other systems that act as a separate layer (THAAD, Aegis Ashore and the ship-based SM-6). S-400 does what Patriot does but has options for long-range missiles that can do part of what the extra US layer does \u2013 in that way it is more flexible and better than Patriot,\u201d Wezeman said.\n\nWezeman said that the S-400 also provides cheaper defense against ballistic missiles than the \u201cseparate U.S. layers,\u201d noting the THAAD is very expensive as a single-purpose anti-missile system.\n\nThe S-400 reportedly costs $500 million, while a Patriot Pac-2 battery costs $1 billion and a THAAD battery is $3 billion.\n\nCost notwithstanding, Wezeman said the U.S. anti-missile systems \u201care more capable against really long-range ballistic missiles (e.g. against North Korean medium or long-range missiles).\u201d\n\nDouglas Barrie, a Senior Fellow for Military Aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), told Polygraph.info that attempting to create \u201ca crude\u201d ranking system of air defense systems \u201cisn\u2019t really informative.\u201d\n\nBarrie said the S-400 is a \u201chighly capable surface-to-air missile system when \u2013 like any other weapon \u2013 it is operated effectively.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlongside the Patriot family, the U.S. has also begun to offer the THAAD system for selected countries. The latter is also a capable SAM system optimized to deal with particular classes of ballistic missiles \u2013 but, again, a ranking against the S-400 is not particularly helpful since the two systems are not designed to counter exactly the same threats,\u201d Barrie said.\n\nWhat does S-400 mean?\n\nIt is not just the functionality of any given air-defense system that makes comparisons difficult. Wezeman said one reason it is difficult to pin down the S-400\u2019s superiority is that the exact nature of an S-400 system is unclear.\n\nJames Bosbotinis, a UK-based specialist in maritime and air force developments, told the Defense IQ research and media portal that the S-400, as it is employed by Russia, does not, in and of itself, form an impenetrable dome. Rather, it is one component of \u201ca layered integrated air defense system,\u201d which also includes short- and medium-range air defense systems, electronic warfare assets airborne early warning systems, fighter aircraft and ground-based radars.\n\n\u201cThis layered integrated air defense system is intended to form an entity stronger than the sum of its parts,\u201d Bosbotinis said.\n\nWezeman shares that view, pointing out the S-400\u2019s \u201ceffectiveness is multiplied when linked to the network.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe S-400 and its competitors can act as stand-alone weapons, but their effectiveness is multiplied when linked to the network. The U.S. offers more advanced parts of such a network (including radar aircraft and command & control systems) than Russia, so one can buy a whole package of integrated systems from the USA instead of some systems from Russia that need still to be integrated with network bits from other suppliers. In that way, the U.S. offer can be superior to that of Russia (but at a high price).\u201d\n\nDefense IQ also noted it is unknown whether or not Russia is selling a watered down version of the S-400, further complicating efforts at comparison.\n\nAnother complication in vetting the S-400\u2019s efficacy is that it never has been tested in combat, Wezeman said, as a much earlier version of the U.S. Patriot system was used in the 1990-1991 Gulf War.\n\nStill, he said Russia has a long track record of developing good air-defense systems, making it likely the S-400 is also good.\n\n\u201cOn paper and in testing it looks good \u2013 as good as the other systems,\u201d Wezeman said. \u201cSo how well the S-400 works compared to the other systems is an unknown.\u201d\n\nThomas Karako, a Senior Fellow of the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), likewise told Polygraph.info the \u201cS-400 looks good on paper.\u201d However, like Wezeman, he noted it never has been tested in combat.\n\n\"Some of older American systems are in the process of being updated, to be sure, but I don\u2019t think anyone doubts the broader technical U.S. superiority in this field,\u201d he said.\n\nSo while there is a very strong argument to be made that the S-400 is a world-class air defense system, Polygraph.info finds claims regarding its superiority to be unclear.", "lang": "en"}
