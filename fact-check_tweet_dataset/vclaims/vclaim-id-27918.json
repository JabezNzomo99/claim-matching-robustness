No, that's not true, the senator does not even exist. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to educate gullible Trump supporters and Republicans about the need to actually click and read links before sharing or liking them in order to avoid being embarrassed by fans of the site later. All the events described in the article are not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by America's Last Line of Defense on February 10, 2019 titled \"BREAKING: Democrat Senator Switches Sides - Pledges To Vote With Trump\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe Democrats have lost yet another of their rising stars to their own ignorance. Senator Stuart Boll, the freshman Senator from Maine, has decided to change his party affiliation to Republican. Boll, whose platform was stricter gun laws and open borders, says he saw the light after spending a weekend at a Presidential retreat to welcome all new members of Congress: \"I knew the platform was wrong, but honestly, I just wanted to get to Washington where I can do some good. Being from Maine, I had never experienced the kind of welfare fraud and violence you see in big cities.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThere are several hints the story is not true:\n\u2022 It was posted in the category \"SATIRICAL SENATORS THAT DON'T EXIST IN NATURE\".\n\u2022 The site has a header that says \"Information you probably shouldn't trust\".\n\u2022 The URL \"https://wearethellod.com/stuart-boll-is-an-anagram/\" had a hint in it too: \"Stuart Boll\" is an anagram for \"Busta Troll\".\n\u2022 The link under the words Senator Stuart Boll goes to the Facebook page of Busta Troll, a notorious prankster: https://www.facebook.com/TheRealBustaTroll\n\u2022 The photo of the \"senator\" seems to be clipped from a stock video:\n\nIf all that isn't enough, the site comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nFor the record, the current senators from Maine are Susan Collins and Angus King.\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several websites including wearethellod.com and conservativetears.com. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake.\n\nBlair and his operation were profiled by the Washington Post on November 17, 2018 by Eli Saslow:\n\n'Nothing on this page is real': How lies become truth in online America November 17 The only light in the house came from the glow of three computer monitors, and Christopher Blair, 46, sat down at a keyboard and started to type. His wife had left for work and his children were on their way to school, but waiting online was his other community, an unreality where nothing was exactly as it seemed.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes wearethellod.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
