The figures came from two different sources, but it turns out both were practically invented out of whole cloth. Let\u2019s explore.\n\nInstead, there is only a broad estimate of about $13 billion in profits for \u201cforced commercial sexual exploitation\u201d for 36 industrialized countries (of which the U.S. represents about 30 percent of the population). ILO officials say they have never given a breakdown by country, only for broad groups of different types of economies.\n\nThe full methodology for the numbers in the report suggests the actual revenue for sex trafficking in this group would be close to $20 billion. It assumed turnover of $100,000 per prostitute, and then assumed profits of nearly 70 percent, or $67,000 per person. The report also estimated there were 200,000 people forced into prostitution in these 36 countries.\n\nBut these profit and revenue figures were based only a handful of examples and then applied across the board, making it a fuzzy number. The estimate of the number of people forced into prostitution is also a broad estimate that could be off by as much as 25 percent, ILO documents say.\n\n\u201cWe pulled our fact sheet with that stat until we are able to update it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are careful to conduct our own primary research or only cite stats that can be supported by credible sources. I\u2019ve read numerous articles questioning the accuracy of human trafficking statistics and want to ensure our office isn\u2019t spreading inaccurate or unsupported information about the seriousness of this crime.\u201d\n\nSo what about Wagner\u2019s claim of $9.5 billion? Her office\u2019s Web site cites the same 2005 ILO report, but after we pointed out that the ILO did not give an estimate for the United States, spokeswoman Moira Bagley Smith cited another source: the 2006 State Department Trafficking in Persons report. In the report, there is this statement:\n\nFirst of all, although Wagner choose to interpret this as a figure for the United States alone, that is wrong. The report clearly states this is a worldwide estimate. Moreover, there is little to suggest that this figure relates specifically to sex trafficking of children or even sex trafficking in general.\n\nFBI officials, after checking the files, say they have no record of having produced such a figure; certainly, they say, no such report was issued. Eventually, The Fact Checker determined this originated as a figure offered in 2004 congressional testimony by an official at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2013except he was referring to worldwide profits from both human smuggling and trafficking. (Smuggling does not involve the use of force or coercion.) ICE originally issued its estimate for profits, also $9.5 billion, but just for \u201chuman smuggling,\u201d in 2003.\n\nThe State Department\u2019s 2004 TIP report attributed the figure (as \u201crevenue\u201d from \u201chuman trafficking\u201d) to \u201cthe U.S. intelligence community.\u201d Somehow, for reasons the State Department cannot explain, it became an \u201cFBI\u201d figure about just human trafficking in the 2005 and 2006 reports. The number was never repeated in any subsequent State Department report. But unfortunately, because of the State Department\u2019s error, it since has been wrongly cited as an official FBI estimate in books, a Congressional Research Service report and other studies.\n\nA State Department official said it was \u201chighly likely\u201d the number originated with the ICE estimate and it also was \u201chighly likely\u201d that the agency pulled it from a news report that incorrectly labeled it as an FBI figure. \u201cPlease let me acknowledge that it is an old Report (2004-2006) and we just don\u2019t use that number anymore,\u201d the official added.\n\nThe ILO in 2014 released another report on human trafficking with updated profit estimates. This report provided a calculation of $26 billion in profits for \u201cforced sexual exploitation\u201d in the 36 industrialized countries, based on the assumption of 300,000 prostitutes, earnings of about $115,000 a year, and profits of $80,000. This time, the revenue figures were based on the book, \u201cSex Trafficking: Inside the Business of Modern Slavery,\u201d by Siddarth Kara.\n\nIn 2014, the Urban Institute published a detailed study of the sex trade in eight major U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C. It estimated that the total size of the underground commercial sex market in 2007 in those cities was $975 million, which represented a decline from $1.02 billion in 2003. But this figure includes all forms of sex work, not just people who are victims of trafficking.", "lang": "en"}
