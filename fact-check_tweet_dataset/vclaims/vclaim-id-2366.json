{"title": "FACT CHECK: Did Barack Obama Attach an Ominous Message to a Letter He Wrote to Donald Trump?", "subtitle": "There was no threat in an Inauguration Day letter from former President Barack Obama to his successor.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2017-09-11T15:27:42+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-2366", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-attach-personal-message-letter-wrote-trump/", "vclaim": "In September 2017, repeat offender Our Land of the Free published an article reporting that former United States President Barack Obama left a personal message to his successor President Donald Trump in the Oval Office, the contents of which remained unrevealed for several months:\n\nSenior Correspondent Art Tubolls reports from the White House that the letter released to the media from former President Obama to President Trump is an incomplete, watered down version presented by the fake news media: \u201cPresident Trump was very clear that he wanted the entire letter released but several agencies pushed him to reconsider. the media then made the final decision, telling the WHOIP that they absolutely would not carry such a private message that would be \u2018twisted\u2019 by the alt-right. We instead decided to release the personal message through back channels so the truth would be known without hurting the feelings of the poor \u2018news\u2019 networks that would have had to report it.\u201d The personal message, added to the letter as a post-script on a second sheet of paper, reads: \u201cOn a personal note, this country has fought back hard from the recession your pals caused. If you destroy everything the American people have rebuilt I will come for you. You have no friends in this town.\n\nThe letter itself is real. Obama did in fact leave a personal note for Trump, continuing a long and friendly tradition of outgoing presidents welcoming (and sometimes warning) the next U.S. leader. The actual letter, which Donald Trump showed to Oval Office visitors, reads as follows:\n\nCongratulations on a remarkable run. Millions have placed their hopes in you, and all of us, regardless of party, should hope for expanded prosperity and security during your tenure. This is a unique office, without a clear blueprint for success, so I don\u2019t know that any advice from me will be particularly helpful. Still, let me offer a few reflections from the past 8 years. First, we\u2019ve both been blessed, in different ways, with great good fortune. Not everyone is so lucky. It\u2019s up to us to do everything we can (to) build more ladders of success for every child and family that\u2019s willing to work hard. Second, American leadership in this world really is indispensable. It\u2019s up to us, through action and example, to sustain the international order that\u2019s expanded steadily since the end of the Cold War, and upon which our own wealth and safety depend. Third, we are just temporary occupants of this office. That makes us guardians of those democratic institutions and traditions \u2014 like rule of law, separation of powers, equal protection and civil liberties \u2014 that our forebears fought and bled for. Regardless of the push and pull of daily politics, it\u2019s up to us to leave those instruments of our democracy at least as strong as we found them. And finally, take time, in the rush of events and responsibilities, for friends and family. They\u2019ll get you through the inevitable rough patches. Michelle and I wish you and Melania the very best as you embark on this great adventure, and know that we stand ready to help in any ways which we can.\n\nAlthough there legitimately is a tradition of outgoing U.S. presidents leaving letters for the next person who assumes the position, Our Land of the Free\u2019s interpretation of it is not legitimate. An often-overlooked (or, perhaps, ignored) disclaimer notice on the web site\u2019s \u201cAbout\u201d page warned all of its content should be considered \u201cfake news\u201c:\n\nOurlandofthefree.com makes no guarantee that anything you find here will be based at all in reality.
