Once you factor in inflation, the fall is 51%.\n\nThis refers to local authority spending on bus services. But that\u2019s not all the public money that goes into bus services.\n\nA larger chunk of funding goes directly from central government towards supporting commercially-run services.\n\nMore recent estimates suggest the overall fall is less than half\n\nA more recent report from the Campaign for Better Transport looked at both local authority spending and central government funding. It found that local authority spending on buses in England, excluding London, fell by \u00a3162 million (43%) between 2009/10 and 2018/19, after adjusting for inflation.\n\nIt also found that central government funding, between 2009/10 to 2017/18 across the same area, had fallen by \u00a3234 million, or 19%.\n\nSo the central government spend, which is a bigger pot of money, (worth over \u00a31 billion in 2009/10, compared with \u00a3381 million of local government spending), has fallen by far less than 50%.\n\nMost funding for bus services comes from fares\n\nEven then, it\u2019s worth mentioning that fares are a bigger part of bus funding than public funding, making up 59% of bus operator revenue in 2017/18 across England excluding London. This has increased from 52% in 2009/10.\n\nLooking more directly at what\u2019s happened to bus services, the number of journeys taken in Great Britain fell from 5.2 billion in 2009/10 to 4.8 billion in 2017/18, a fall of 7%.\n\nThe number of miles a year travelled by local buses in Great Britain is down 10% since 2009/10.", "lang": "en"}
