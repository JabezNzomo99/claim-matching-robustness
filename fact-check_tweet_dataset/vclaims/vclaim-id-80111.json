You need an invitation to join it.\n\nThe group is a close-knit circuit of individuals buying and selling all sorts of things. However, amidst deals violating Facebook\u2019s terms and conditions, we stumbled upon an issue even more grave \u2013 people offering to manufacture Aadhaar cards.\n\nIn the screenshot below, one of the members can be seen asking others to \u201cinbox\u201d him if they want Aadhaar cards. He claims that the ID proof will be \u201c1001% working\u201d. He also makes a post offering \u201cfake Aadhaar cards for Facebook verification\u201d.\n\nAnother member claims that he has at his disposal \u201cmany\u201d PDF files of Aadhaar cards. He wishes to know at what price he will be able to sell them. One of the members advertises his stock of 100 Aadhaar cards as \u201cloot loot loot\u201d, selling them for Rs 150 each.\n\nThere are also offerings of PAN cards in the group.\n\nThe collage below captures several others offering fake Aadhaar cards.\n\nHowever, this bargain is not one-sided as supply is only created by demand. In the screenshot below, members can be seen willing to purchase fake Aadhaar cards as long as they \u201clook real\u201d.\n\nOne of the members also asked for Aadhaar data, which he claimed was \u201cavailable a few days back.\u201d He wrote, \u201cI am willing to pay good money to anyone who has it.\u201d\n\nThere was another Aadhaar related demand that came to our notice \u2013 editing. In the screenshot below, one of the members is looking for someone who can edit his date of birth in his Aadhaar card. \u201cBas real lagna chahiye,\u201d he writes.\n\nWe discovered a substantial demand for Aadhaar related editing work for various purposes.\n\nRecently, Alt News published another story about a closed Facebook group that goes by the name \u201cSharing is Caring \u2013 Advertising Deals\u201d. Our detailed report disclosed the inner workings of its 18,000 odd members who regularly buy/sell Facebook pages, Instagram accounts and more.\n\nHelp for Friends is more close-knit than Sharing is Caring (SIC) but has a lot of the same members as SIC. Just like in SIC, deals on Facebook pages dedicated to politics, army, girls, actresses and cricket and more are made on HFF too.\n\nDeals on Fake Aadhar cards are not limited to HFF. We stumbled upon deals related to Aadhaar in the \u2018Sharing is Caring\u2019 group as well. The screenshots below are from SIC. If you look closely, some of these names appear in the screenshots of HFF posted earlier in the article.\n\nHowever, post Alt New\u2019s story, admins of Sharing is Caring seem to have become more vigilant about what sells in the group. One of them posted \u201cnew rules as per the need of time\u201d, which now penalise (temporarily ban) members making deals on Aadhaar cards or any government ID proof and fake government offer websites, among others.\n\nThere is a reason why groups like SIC and HFF keep their status as closed or secret as the members are well aware that their dealings are often illegal. As this issue comes to light, it becomes pertinent that necessary actions are taken against these groups.", "lang": "en"}
