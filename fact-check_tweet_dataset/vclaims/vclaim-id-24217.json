The claim is false; the photo has circulated online since 2018 when it was used in reports about cows that died after lightning struck a field.\n\nThe photo was shared in this Facebook post on May 5, 2019.\n\nIt has been shared more than 50 times after being posted to an Australia-based Facebook page with more than 33,000 followers.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe photo shows a row of cows lying next to a fence in a field. The text added across the top of the photo states: \u201cELECTRIC FENCES = GENOCIDE\u201d.\n\nIn the Facebook post, the lengthy caption states, in part: \u201cToo often, filthy farmers would surround \u2018their\u2019 animal prison with high powered electricity wire to not only hurt, but to KILL any animal trying to escape. These animals live a life of fear, slavery & hunger and sometimes they would pee on the fences to commit suicide because they just can\u2019t handle it anymore and would rather die than to eat plain grass all the time\u2026 The animals are usually then left there to decompose, as it is a warning to other animals.\u201d\n\nThe claim is false; the photo actually shows cows that died after lightning struck a field in Beaudesert, a town in Queensland, Australia, according to multiple media reports.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found this March 5, 2018, report published by the Beaudesert Times, a weekly newspaper in Queensland, Australia.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the report:\n\nThe opening lines of the report state: \u201cSix cows from the property of grazier Eda Shirley in Beaudesert were found dead after a storm on February 26.\n\n\u201cMs Shirley\u2019s son Derek said it appeared that they had been killed instantaneously after lightning struck the fence.\u201d\n\nThe same photo was used in this report published on March 8, 2018, by ABC.", "lang": "en"}
