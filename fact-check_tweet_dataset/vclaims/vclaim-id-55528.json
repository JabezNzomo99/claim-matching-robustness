Amid intense political and media focus on an ongoing housing crisis causing increased homelessness in major cities like Los Angeles, fear started to spread about a biblical disease.\n\nThe rumor stemmed from a September 2019 opinion piece penned by Dr. Marc Siegel, a doctor of internal medicine at New York University\u2019s Langone medical center. In the piece published by The Hill, Siegel wrote that he feared immigration and a rising homeless population in Los Angeles could be the epicenter of a new leprosy epidemic.\n\nThat bit of sensationalism proved tantalizing for many media outlets, which ran with the claim despite the lack of supporting evidence. But if the idea of the dreaded New Testament disease making a resurgence in Hollywood sounds like the plot of a bad movie about End Times, that\u2019s because the claim is false.\n\nThe only piece of evidence cited by Siegel was a paper about leprosy cases in Los Angeles. But Dr. Maria Teresa Ochoa, an associate professor of clinical dermatology at the University of Southern California\u2019s Keck School of Medicine and a co-author of that paper, told us Siegel\u2019s piece is inaccurate and also appears to exploit two political wedge issues: immigration and homelessness.\n\nOchoa called the furor over a non-existent leprosy outbreak in Los Angeles \u201cthe most ridiculous thing I have ever seen.\u201d Although Siegel claims that most patients cited by the paper are Latinos \u201coriginating from Mexico,\u201d and that therefore raises the specter of immigration driving a rise in cases, Ochoa said that\u2019s simply baseless.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about immigration or the homeless at all\u201d in the paper, she told us. \u201cI don\u2019t have one patient [with the disease] who is homeless.\u201d The reason most of the cases of leprosy cited in the paper were Latino patients was because of demographics: The area of Los Angeles where the clinic is located has a large Latino population.\n\nOchoa added that Mexico doesn\u2019t have a major public health issue with leprosy. The countries with the biggest infection problems are India, Brazil, and Indonesia.\n\nOchoa\u2019s paper is a summary of 187 case files from L.A.\u2019s leprosy clinic between 1973 and 2018. It does not warn of a looming epidemic nor posit an increase in cases. Instead, it notes that although the disease is rare in the United States, leprosy (also known as Hansen\u2019s Disease) still occurs. Thus, medical professionals must be prepared to treat it.\n\nOchoa said the biggest risk factor for contracting Hansen\u2019s Disease is prolonged exposure to a patient who is contagious with it. Leprosy is also difficult to catch. In 95 percent of incidents in which people come in contact with leprosy patients, those people do not contract the disease.\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, \u201cno evidence [exists] of local transmission, [and] there is no risk for an outbreak.\u201d In an email, an L.A. public health official said no cases of the disease have been diagnosed among the homeless. Over the last decade, the county has seen between zero and four cases per year, averaging two cases per year. Health officials further specified that leprosy is \u201cnot highly infectious, but rather requires prolonged and close contact for transmission to occur. Patients under treatment are not at risk for spreading disease to others.\u201d\n\nThose with leprosy were a source of fear and scorn in the Bible, but now the disease is treatable with antibiotics. Experts now understand it\u2019s caused by a bacteria called Mycobacterium leprae that causes nerve damage if left untreated. \u201cWe keep stigmatizing this diseases with false information,\u201d Ochoa said.\n\nSiegel could not be reached for comment by the time of publication.", "lang": "en"}
