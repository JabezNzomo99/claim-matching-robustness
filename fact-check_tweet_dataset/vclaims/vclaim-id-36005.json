Onlookers may not be able to tell the difference.\u201d\n\nThere is no record of Twain ever saying or writing this quote. It may be a variation of an expression quoted in an 1878 New York newspaper.\n\nSamuel Clemens, better known by his pen name Mark Twain, wrote several novels that are widely considered classics, including \u201cThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer\u201d and \u201cAdventures of Huckleberry Finn.\u201d\n\nHowever, The Daily Caller found no evidence that Twain ever wrote the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. The saying does not appear in those books, or any of his other works.\n\n\u201cThat is yet another good one he did not say,\u201d Winthrop University english professor John Bird told The Caller via email.\n\n\u201cThe core idea of the quotation under examination appeared as a biblical proverb,\u201d writes the website Quote Investigator. \u201cThe popular saying that has been incorrectly attributed to Mark Twain is part of a large diverse family of statements that began to appear by 1878.\u201d\n\nIndeed, a variation of the quote can be traced back to a 1878 edition of The Rochester Evening Express, where it appeared attributed to another periodical: \u201cDon\u2019t argue with a fool, or the listener will say there is a pair of you. \u2014 Cincinnati Breakfast Table.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
