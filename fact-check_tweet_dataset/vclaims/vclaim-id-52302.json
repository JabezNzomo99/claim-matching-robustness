Let\u2019s be honest. Their sole intention is to take control of the country and use it as a U.S. military base. 40 of 43 countries who signed MCC agreements are said to have ended up with a military base installed in their country and loosing their sovereignty. Although President Rajapaksa who promised nearly 7 million Sri Lankan people who appointed him into the office, and despite the growing opposition including his committee\u2019s recommendation, as a typical corrupted Sri Lankan politician, he shows signs toward signing the agreement. For example, his new Minister of Security Affairs, Mr. Colombage told WION news yesterday that India is No.1 on Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign policy. As we all know, India is an American puppet. He also said in his inauguration speech \u201cWe must learn to think outside the box\u201d. He went on to say, \u201cno one will loose any lands that are inherited in the family\u201d.\n\n We just have to wait and see what he\u2019s going to do. If he signs the MCC trap, him and his party will face the same consequences as UNP, at next election, or sooner.", "lang": "en"}
