[1]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined Mr Perrottet\u2019s claim that NSW\u2019s economy is the strongest in the country and that the Labor government - last in power in March 2011 - left NSW in last place.\n\nMr Perrottet\u2019s office told AAP FactCheck the minister\u2019s claims were based on historical and current quarterly State of the States reports by Commsec, Australia's largest online stockbroking firm operated by the Commonwealth Bank.\n\nThe reports rank each state on eight \u201ckey indicators\u201d of economic growth; retail spending; equipment investment; unemployment; construction work done; population growth; housing finance and dwelling commencements. [2]\n\nAccording to the most recent State of the States report, released in January 2019, NSW is the equal strongest economy in the nation, sharing the top spot with Victoria. [2]\n\nAAP FactCheck found Mr Perrottet\u2019s claim was half true as NSW shares the nation\u2019s top economic performance position with Victoria, according to CommSec\u2019s January 2019 State of the States report.\n\nAAP FactCheck could not verify the Treasurer\u2019s claim that NSW was last under Labor in 2011 because, according to CommSec, an economic performance ranking was not used in 2011, unlike current reports.\n\nIn the January 2011 State of the States CommSec report, the last before Labor lost the March 26 election, NSW appears to be ranked last with the report stating \u201cNSW economy is not far away from the pack\u201d. [3]\n\nBut in the April 2011 report, just after Labor was voted out, CommSec did not name the worst state economy, but listed NSW, Queensland and Tasmania as the weakest performers. [4]\n\nThe treasurer\u2019s claim that NSW was ranked last under Labor in 2011 is impossible to determine as an exact ranking was not given in the January 2011 and April 2011 CommSec reports. NSW was grouped as one of the last but not the last.", "lang": "en"}
