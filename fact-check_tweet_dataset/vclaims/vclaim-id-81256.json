Usually, Republicans describe the dropping of the Bush plan for missile defense as a \u201cgift,\u201d but on Sunday Cheney said it took place after a \u201cmere request\u201d from Russian President Vladimir Putin. He then unfavorably contrasted President Obama\u2019s handling of the crisis over Crimea with Bush\u2019s handling of a similar showdown over Georgia in 2008.\n\nToward the end of his presidency, George W. Bush, concerned about a possible threat to Europe and the United States from Iranian missiles, proposed to install 10 interceptor missiles in Poland and a radar system in the Czech Republic. The Russians certainly were not happy about it, even though U.S. officials insisted the system was aimed at Iran.\n\nIn September 2009, Obama announced that he was scrapping the Bush plan and introducing an alternative, what he called a \u201cEuropean phased adaptive approach.\u201d The four-part plan would initially focus on threats posed by Iranian short- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Europe, and then eventually would include a fourth phase that would target as-yet undeveloped Iranian intercontinental missiles.\n\nAlthough Obama made the announcement as he was actively trying to \u201creset\u201d relations with Russia, the \u201crequest\u201d to change the plan actually came from Bush\u2019s \u2014 and Obama\u2019s \u2014 defense secretary, Robert M. Gates. In fact, Gates had recommended the original plan to Bush but decided the new version would be more effective, less costly and timelier.\n\nIndeed, in his memoir, \u201cDuty,\u201d published in January, Gates noted that the Bush plan was already running into trouble in both Prague and Warsaw and likely would have been rejected by parliaments in both countries. \u201cThe Polish and Czech governments were relieved,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cI sincerely believed the new program was better \u2014 more in accord with the political realities in Europe and more effective against the emerging Iranian threat,\u201d Gates added. \u201cWhile there certainly were some in the State Department and the White House who believed the third site in Europe was incompatible with the Russian \u2018reset,\u2019 we in Defense did not. Making the Russians happy wasn\u2019t exactly on my to-do list.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow ironic that U.S. critics of the new approach had portrayed it as a big concession to the Russians,\u201d Gates added sardonically. \u201cIt would have been nice to hear a critic in Washington \u2014 just once in my career \u2014 say, Well I got that wrong.\u201d\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the second part of Cheney\u2019s comments \u2014 that the Bush response to the Russian incursion of Georgia was \u201cmore robust.\u201d To some extent, this is difficult to judge because the situations are different.\n\nIn the Georgian-Russian conflict of 2008, there was a split between Europe and the United States on the cause of war. Many Europeans thought Georgia itself had provoked the Russian military response \u2014an opinion confirmed by an E.U.-sponsored report in 2009 \u2014 whereas WikiLeaks cables showed that U.S. diplomats in 2008 relied all too often on the Georgian version of disputed events.\n\nThe war started on Aug. 7, 2008, and by Aug. 11 the airlift of nearly 2,000 troops from Iraq was nearly complete, according to the Pentagon, which emphasized it was not flying the soldiers to the war zone. On Aug. 12, a cease-fire was announced by Russia. \u201cDid the U.S. airlift of the Georgian troops to Tbilisi change the tide of battle or Moscow\u2019s political calculations? No. The Russian army handily drove them back,\u201d wrote former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Steven Pifer in Politico.\n\nAs for the ships carrying \u201cvarious kinds of supplies,\u201d Cheney is referring to humanitarian supplies brought by U.S. ships in late August \u2014 many days after the cease-fire went into effect. The Coast Guard cutter Dallas, for instance, carried 34 tons of aid. The guided missile destroyer USS McFaul also carried humanitarian aid, entering the Black Sea on Aug. 22.\n\nMeanwhile, former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice has acknowledged that \u201cthe United States and Europe could agree on only a few actions to isolate Russia politically.\u201d By contrast \u2014 in part because Europeans do not blame Ukraine for the tensions \u2014 in the current situation the United States and European nations have agreed on several rounds of financial sanctions. Whether these sanctions will be effective remains to be seen.\n\nGiven that former defense secretary Gates, who served with Cheney, sharply disputes the notion that Obama dropped the defense plan in response to Russian pressure \u2014 or a \u201cmere request\u2019 from Putin \u2014 it\u2019s a bit amazing that Cheney is still trying to argue this point. Gates\u2019s memoir is often tough on Obama, giving his account of this particular issue additional credibility.", "lang": "en"}
