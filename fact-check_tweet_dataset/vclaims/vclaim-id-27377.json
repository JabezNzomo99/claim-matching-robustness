As the public phase of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry begins on Wednesday, here are some of the most common rationales Republicans are putting forward to argue Mr. Trump\u2019s actions are not impeachable, and how they stack up against the facts. Mr. Trump himself is the most vocal proponent of this shoot-the-messenger defense. He has falsely claimed at least two dozen times that the whistle-blower complaint that spurred the impeachment inquiry was \u201cinaccurate,\u201d \u201cfalse\u201d or \u201ca lie.\u201d In fact, the White House released a reconstructed transcript of the president\u2019s phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine that corroborated much of what the whistle-blower reported. Witness testimony has also backed up and fleshed out the whistle-blower\u2019s main points. Mr. Trump has also accused Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the whistle-blower, of planning to \u201coverthrow\u201d the president, pointing to a 2017 Twitter post as proof. In the tweet, Mr. Zaid said a \u201ccoup\u201d had started and impeachment would follow, in reaction to Mr. Trump firing Sally Q. Yates as acting attorney general. (Mr. Zaid told The Times last week that his tweet was taken out of context and that he had also represented the Republican National Committee.)\n\nThe whistle-blower cannot be trusted, according to Mr. Trump, because he or she is a \u201cstrong Democrat.\u201d While Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community, has said the whistle-blower showed \u201carguable political bias\u201d in favor of a rival candidate, that did not alter Mr. Atkinson\u2019s conclusion that the complaint was credible. Mr. Trump has also branded several officials who have testified before Congress as \u201cNever Trumpers.\u201d Speaking about Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, who donated $1 million to the president\u2019s inauguration committee, Mr. Trump said this month that \u201cI hardly know the gentleman\u201d \u2014 despite having called Mr. Sondland \u201ca really good man and great American\u201d and \u201chighly respected\u201d last month. For weeks, Mr. Trump and his allies have aimed to hammer home this simple defense: there was no quid pro quo linking American military aid to Ukraine with investigations the president sought into the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a leading Democratic presidential candidate, and the conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that hacked the Democratic National Committee in 2016.\n\nAs an addendum, Mr. Trump has repeatedly cited Mr. Zelensky\u2019s denial that he felt pressured as evidence of their \u201cperfect call.\u201d William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, suggested otherwise when he testified to Congress that a national security adviser to Mr. Zelensky told him that the Ukrainian president \u201cdid not want to be used as a pawn in a U.S. re-election campaign.\u201d This argument \u2014 that Ukraine had been unaware that military aid had been withheld so it was impossible that Mr. Trump had conditioned its release on Ukraine opening certain investigations \u2014 has been employed by several Republican lawmakers as well as Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s eldest son, with varying degrees of accuracy. \u201cFirst of all, because nothing was withheld. The other guy on the other side actually said, \u2018I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u2019 No one knew any aid was even being withheld,\u201d the younger Mr. Trump said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d last week. \u201cThe president was pressuring for investigation but there was no quo. The Ukrainian leader did nothing different to actually get the aid,\u201d Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska said in late October. Representative John Ratcliffe of Texas focused on the timing of the president\u2019s call with Mr. Zelensky. \u201cNeither Zelensky or any Ukrainian was aware there was a hold on military aid on July 25,\u201d Mr. Ratcliffe said last month, adding that \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter\u201d that the Ukrainians learned about it later. First, it\u2019s not true that \u201cnothing was withheld.\u201d The White House disclosed on July 18 in a secure call with national security officials that it was freezing the aid, and did not release it until Sept. 11, after coming under bipartisan pressure from Congress.\n\nThe New York Times has reported that some Ukrainian officials had learned of the aid freeze by the first week of August, and the whistle-blower\u2019s account said he had heard as of \u201cearly August\u201d that some Ukrainian officials were aware the aid might be in jeopardy. Mr. Zelensky has said he raised the issue with Vice President Mike Pence in a Sept. 1 meeting. According to Mr. Taylor, Mr. Sondland told a top aide to Mr. Zelensky that the \u201csecurity assistance money would not come\u201d until Kiev committed to pursuing the investigation into Mr. Biden\u2019s son. (This was also corroborated by Mr. Sondland.) It\u2019s also not true that Mr. Zelensky \u201cdid nothing different\u201d in an attempt to release the aid. He had agreed to appear on CNN on Sept. 13 and announce the investigations Mr. Trump had sought; that ultimately did not happen, but only because the White House released the aid. Denying that the president had personally directed a quid pro quo Allies of Mr. Trump have brushed aside the testimonies of Mr. Taylor and Mr. Sondland as mere speculation, not proof. Their argument is that there is no justification for impeachment \u201cbased on somebody saying they presumed and someone else saying they interpreted,\u201d Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, said last week. \u201cBill Taylor\u2019s presumption of the president\u2019s involvement or whatever came from a media story,\u201d Representative Doug Collins, Republican of Georgia, said last Wednesday on Fox News. \u201cHe pointed to Mr. Giuliani, he didn\u2019t point to the president.\u201d\n\nThat media story was a New York Times report in May that detailed efforts by Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, to press Ukraine into investigating Mr. Biden\u2019s son and the theory that origin of the special counsel inquiry into Russia\u2019s interference in 2016. Mr. Giuliani told The Times\u2019s Kenneth P. Vogel that Mr. Trump supported his actions and \u201cbasically knows what I\u2019m doing, sure, as his lawyer\u201d \u2014 contradicting the suggestion that Mr. Trump was unaware. \u201cSondland\u2019s actions were based on Sondland\u2019s assumptions,\u201d Representative Mike Johnson of Louisiana, said last Wednesday on CNN. \u201cThere are many assumptions about a lot of what he said and that was based on his ideas about what was happening, not necessarily about what the president said.\u201d\n\nMr. Sondland, in his revised testimony, did say that he \u201cpresumed that the aid suspension had become linked to the proposed anti-corruption statement.\u201d But he also noted that he believed the Ukrainian president needed to make a public pledge that he was beginning certain investigations before a White House visit would be granted \u2014 a condition, he said, that was communicated by Mr. Giuliani at Mr. Trump\u2019s direction. The most explicit example of this line of argument comes from Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky. \u201cMenendez tried it. Murphy tried it. Biden tried it. Trump\u2019s tried it. They\u2019re all doing it. They are all trying to manipulate Ukraine to get some kind of investigation, either to end an investigation or start an investigation,\u201d Mr. Paul said on Sunday on NBC. In May 2018, Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey and two other Democrats wrote a letter to Yuriy Lutsenko, then Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, expressing concerns that Mr. Lutsenko\u2019s office had frozen investigations related to the special counsel investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III because officials were wary of offending Mr. Trump. The letter made no explicit mention of aid.\n\nSenator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, met with Mr. Zelensky in September as part of a bipartisan delegation. The Times reported that Mr. Murphy \u201csaid he urged Mr. Zelensky not to heed the requests from Mr. Giuliani, warning that to do so could threaten bipartisan support for Ukraine in Washington.\u201d Mr. Murphy later described his comments as a \u201ccommon sense\u201d caution against interfering in the 2020 election. As vice president, Mr. Biden had called for the dismissal of Viktor Shokin, who became prosecutor general of Ukraine in 2015, and Mr. Biden threatened to withhold assistance from the United States until Mr. Shokin was pushed out. But Mr. Biden\u2019s actions were in line with United States foreign policy as well as the stated positions of Senate Republicans, European Union leaders and the International Monetary Fund, all of whom were calling for Mr. Shokin\u2019s ouster. Arguing that quid pro quo is \u2018not an impeachable offense\u2019 Some Republicans have not gone so far as to completely absolve Mr. Trump, but argue that his actions do not rise to the level of an impeachable offense. \u201cI believe that it is inappropriate for a president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival,\u201d Representative Mac Thornberry of Texas said on Sunday. \u201cI do not believe it was impeachable.\u201d \u201cI think if you\u2019re trying to get information on a political rival to use in a political campaign is not something a president or any official should be doing,\u201d Representative Will Hurd of Texas said on Fox News Sunday. \u201cI believe that\u2019s something that would make it \u2014 have to truly consider whether impeachment is the right tool or not.\u201d Curious about the accuracy of a claim?
