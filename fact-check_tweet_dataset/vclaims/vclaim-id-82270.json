Walker won his first gubernatorial election in 2010, the recall election in 2012 and his re-election in 2014. He governed conservatively, fought the unions and still won three times in four years in a blue state, he says, and he can do the same on the national level.\n\nWalker\u2019s characterization of Wisconsin as \u201cblue\u201d appears to hinge on the fact that the state had voted for Democratic presidents since Ronald Reagan\u2019s re-election in 1984. (Only two Republican presidents have won in Wisconsin since 1960: Richard Nixon and Reagan.) Indeed, how it votes for president has become a common way to define whether a state is blue or red.\n\nWisconsin is \u201ca different state politically\u201d during presidential years, \u201cdrawing a bigger, younger, less conservative, more diverse electorate,\u201d Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s Craig Gilbert wrote in \u201cThe Wisconsin Voter,\u201d his column about the state\u2019s political trends. Republicans lost all 12 contests for U.S. senator and president since 1988, but won eight of the 13 contests for U.S. senator and governor on non-presidential ballots since 1986, Gilbert wrote.\n\nStill, the Democratic margin of victory in presidential elections often has been small, noted Ken Mayer, University of Wisconsin-Madison political science professor: 0.4 percent in 2004, 0.2 percent in 2000 and 3.6 percent in 1988. Since 1987, Wisconsin has had a Republican governor 20 of 28 years, Mayer said: \u201cI\u2019d characterize us as a state that is reliably, but not sure, Democratic in presidential years and generally Republican in midterms.\u201d\n\nWalker was elected governor in non-presidential years (his 2012 recall election was in June) with a much lower turnout (about 50 to 55 percent, compared to the 70 percent turnout in presidential years) that is much less diverse or Democratic than in presidential years. There has been particularly low midterm turnout in deep blue counties \u2014 even his home county of Milwaukee, where he lost in all three elections. It\u2019s questionable how he would fare with a much bluer presidential electorate.\n\nWisconsin has a Republican-majority state government, with Walker as governor and the GOP in control of both legislative chambers, as PolitiFact Wisconsin pointed out. But not too long ago \u2014 just before the 2010 elections \u2014 Wisconsin state government was blue, with a Democratic governor and Democrats controlling the legislature.\n\nHow about the notion that Walker\u2019s electability in the state plays favorably in the presidential race? Julia Azari, Marquette University political science professor, said his victories can\u2019t necessarily be extrapolated to the national level: \u201cIf you think about the states that are swingy but tend to be a lot bluer, like Colorado or Pennsylvania, it\u2019s not obvious that Walker has anything that would make him terribly special in those states. Although he won [in Wisconsin], it wasn\u2019t by making nice with conventionally Democratic voters. \u2026 What he\u2019s been able to do is do really, really well in areas where Republicans do well.\u201d\n\nWhile Walker says he fought and won in a blue state, it is difficult to definitively call Wisconsin a blue state. Color-coding states as such often relies on the state\u2019s record electing presidents. Using that measure, Walker was elected in a state that voted for a Democratic president in both 2008 and 2012, before and after he became governor. But the state leans bluer in presidential years and was not as reliably blue in the elections that Walker won.\n\nBy other measures \u2014 state legislature, the governor, congressional delegates and U.S. senators \u2014 Wisconsin\u2019s hue is a mix of blue and red. In definitively calling Wisconsin a blue state (apparently based on its choice for president), touting his three victories in said blue state (even though he didn\u2019t face the presidential voters in those three elections) and then extrapolating his electability on the national level \u2014 Walker makes a leap in boasting his record.
