She posted the same picture along with an explanatory video on April 26, 2020.\n\nIn the video, she assures that she\u2019s doing well and explaines that she is not treating coronavirus patients but is voluntarily helping out healthcare workers during the pandemic. She also said that she is a BJP member in Uttar Pradesh and a social worker.\n\nThe above information proves that the woman in the picture is not Dr. Maneesha Patel but Dr. Richa Rajpoot and she\u2019s not dead.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
