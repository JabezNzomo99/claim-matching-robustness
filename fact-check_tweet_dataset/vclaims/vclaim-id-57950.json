Williams\u2019 manager confirmed the claim is false.\n\nA Grammy Award-winning recording artist and the son of late Country Music Hall of Fame inductee Hank Williams, Williams is known for such songs as \u201cA Country Boy Can Survive\u201d and \u201cAll My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight.\u201d The Country Music Association announced on Aug. 12 that he would join the Country Music Hall of Fame as part of its class of 2020.\n\nA post on Facebook shares a lengthy quote, purportedly from Williams, that tells people to \u201cleave it alone\u201d if they are offended by something. The post, which mentions statues, the book \u201cGone With The Wind,\u201d the Bible and military bases, among other things, does not specify where the musician allegedly made or posted the long statement.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like the names of military bases, but I do, so leave them alone and stay away from them,\u201d the statement reads, in part. \u201cYou don\u2019t like the police force, then don\u2019t call them when you are in trouble, but leave them alone so I feel safer having them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are the things you want so much more important than what I want?\u201d the post continues. \u201cAre your demands greater than my likes? Is it because you use intimidation, blackmail and force to get your way- that you do? Let\u2019s make a deal. I will leave what you like alone and you leave what I like alone and the world will be a better place for everyone.\u201d\n\nBut there is no evidence Williams made or posted it. An internet search by Check Your Fact found no credible report of Williams making the statement or posting it online. The statement in question also doesn\u2019t appear on Williams\u2019 official website, nor can it be found on his Facebook, Twitter or Instagram accounts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fake,\u201d Ken Levitan, Williams\u2019 manager, confirmed to Check Your Fact in an email.

The long statement also appears in a June 3 column written by Darrell Berkheimer in The Union, a Nevada County, California, newspaper. Berkheimer wrote in the column that the quoted statement came from an email sent to him, but he did not identify the email\u2019s author.", "lang": "en"}
