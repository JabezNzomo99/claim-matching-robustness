Or is someone trying to send Christians a message?\u201d the article on theblacksphere.net reads. \u201cMany people speculate this is a Muslim attack on Christianity. In 2016, a car parked outside Notre Dame was discovered. It contained full gas tanks and documents written in Arabic. Therefore, authorities were well-aware of the threats posed against Notre Dame.\u201d\n\nBut there is no evidence tying that 2016 episode with this week\u2019s fire, as some news outlets worked to make clear. The U.K.\u2019s Telegraph, which covered the 2016 incident at the time, affixed an update to its story indicating: \u201cThis story is from 2016 and unrelated to the fire at Notre-Dame on April 15 2019.\u201d\n\nTheblacksphere.net, which makes a passing reference to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S., further attempts to support its narrative by citing a now-deleted tweet from Christopher Hale, a self-described \u201cTennessee politico\u201d who unsuccessfully ran for Congress in the Democratic primary last year and who worked on faith outreach for former President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cA Jesuit friend in Paris who works in #NotreDame told me cathedral staff said the fire was intentionally set,\u201d the tweet said. In a subsequent tweet \u2014 omitted by the story \u2014 Hale acknowledged that his friend had \u201czero evidence\u201d and that it was an \u201cunsubstantiated rumor.\u201d\n\nIn a phone interview with FactCheck.org, Hale called the tweet \u201chearsay\u201d and \u201ca horrible mistake.\u201d He said he deleted it after about 10 minutes.\n\n\u201cIt became clear it was becoming weaponized by Islamophobic forces,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worst parts of the internet were using it for nefarious means.\u201d\n\nOther websites, including InfoWars, also used the tweet to claim the fire was \u201cdeliberately\u201d set. They all referred to Hale as a \u201cTIME columnist,\u201d although Hale told us he writes occasional opinion pieces for the magazine and other outlets.\n\nAnd while theblacksphere.net story says that \u201cHale isn\u2019t the only one to believe this fire has Muslim ties,\u201d Hale pointed out that his tweets never made any mention of any supposed Muslim connection to the fire.\n\nHale declined to discuss his friend who provided the initial, unsubstantiated rumor, but he said: \u201cNeither he or I think it was anything but an accident.\u201d\n\nTheblacksphere.net story also links to a grainy video on Facebook purporting to show \u201cWHAT LOOKS LIKE A MUSLIM ON THE LEDGE,\u201d at the cathedral. But, as the French newspaper Lib\u00e9ration\u2018s fact-checking arm, CheckNews, found, clearer video from CNBC shows that the individual in the video was actually a firefighter.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nSamuel, Henry. \u201cGas tanks and Arabic documents found in unmarked car by Paris\u2019 Notre-Dame cathedral spark terror fears.\u201d The Telegraph. 8 Sep 2016.\n\n\u201cParis prosecutor \u2013 accident seen as likely cause of Notre Dame fire.\u201d Reuters. 16 Apr 2019.", "lang": "en"}
