But before you mindlessly click on that text message that looks like it\u2019s from FedEx, take a second look because it could be a scam. Some people around the country are receiving text messages that show a supposed tracking code and link to \u2018set delivery preferences.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe text is deceiving as it uses the recipient\u2019s real name. The link directs people to a fake Amazon listing and then asks them to take a customer satisfaction survey, according to HowToGeek.com. After answering a couple questions, the scam then asks for personal information and a credit card number to claim a free gift.\u201d\n\nThe formula of words used in the text message, in particular the key phrase \u201cwaiting for your to set delivery preferences,\u201d was corroborated and confirmed in multiple examples posted by social media users, as well as at least one law enforcement agency, Duxbury Police Department in Massachusetts:\n\nThe scam\u2019s methodology was outlined on the website HowToGeek.com, which explained as follows:\n\nAfter you click on the link [in the text message], you\u2019re taken to an obviously-fake Amazon listing and asked to take a customer satisfaction survey. As a thank you for answering some questions, you\u2019re given the opportunity to claim an \u201cexpensive\u201d product for free as a reward. Now it\u2019s time to tell the spammer where you live and provide them with a credit card number. As you can see, the \u201creward\u201d is free but you still need to pay a small shipping and handling fee. The real scam resides in the fine print. By agreeing to pay the small shipping fee, you\u2019re also signing up for a 14-day trial to the company that sells the scammy products. After the trial period, you will be billed $98.95 every month and sent a new supply of whatever item you claimed as a reward.\n\nIn response to widespread concerns over the prevalence of the scam in January 2020, FedEx itself advised the public on Twitter that \u201cWe do not send unsolicited texts or emails requesting money package or personal information,\u201d and \u201cSuspicious messages should be deleted without being opened and reported to abuse@fedex.com.\u201d\n\nSome social media users linked the FedEx scam to sex trafficking, claiming that it was ultimately designed as \u201ca way for sex traffickers to track you down.\u201d Snopes has found no evidence whatsoever that the FedEx text message scam has any connection to sex trafficking, rather than simply being a way to fraudulently obtain payments from unsuspecting recipients.\n\nThe purported connection to sex trafficking appears to be mere speculation based on no more than the fact that the scam involves the acquisition of a victim\u2019s mailing address.", "lang": "en"}
