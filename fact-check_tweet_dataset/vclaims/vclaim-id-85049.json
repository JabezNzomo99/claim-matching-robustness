Trust me, we Muslims will make the life of Hindus Hell! We Muslims will make Hindus our slaves! Trust me, after Modi loses Muslims will rule India!\u201d is the text of a tweet by a Twitter handle called @Muhammadzee69. The biography of this Twitter account claimed that the person is a teacher in Dhirubhai Ambani International school. The abusive, bigoted, nature of the tweet and the alleged association of this person with Dhirubhai\u2019s school become an object of outrage on social media.\n\nShefali Vaidya, who is followed by PM Modi on Twitter, put out a tweet while tagging Mumbai police. This got retweeted over 1200 times.\n\nSome of the other tweets on this issue which got wide circulation were by Twitter accounts namely @SaffireGem and @goyalsanjeev which got retweeted over 900 and 600 times respectively.\n\nMadhu Kishwar, who has a penchant for succumbing to fakery, also tweeted about this and then deleted it later. Screenshots of her tweet made it to various right-wing Facebook pages and Whatsapp groups and were shared widely.\n\nFake News site Postcard News also published a screenshot of the tweet on their Facebook page.\n\nAbhimanyu Basu, the Deputy Head at Dhirubhai Ambani International School, Mumbai, clarified on Twitter that no person with the name Muhammad Zeeshan was associated with the school in any position or capacity whatsoever.\n\nFurther, Alt News also came across a tweet by a Jammu & Kashmir based journalist whose picture had been appropriated by the said account a few days ago. Stealing others\u2019 pictures has been a trend that has been noticed repeatedly with fake accounts.\n\nAlt News also looked up some of the old tweets from this account, the contents of which were in stark contradiction to the views presented by this said person in his \u2018anti-Hindu\u2019 tweets. There were tweets which were either abusive toward the minority community or endorsement of right wing politics and politicians.\n\nThe erratic nature of this account\u2019s tweets dates back to the time when this account was first created in October 2017. The first three tweets from this account were similar to the tweets that have now created much outrage.\n\nA clear case of a fake account pushing out tweets that gain currency with the right-wing ecosystem, but clearly not the first. Sample these.\n\u2022 A Muslim who appreciates the greatness of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, roots for Yogi Adityanath and is critical of the Muslim community. Gini Khan, who lives in Canberra was the toast of the right-wing social media ecosystem for her glamour and her thoroughly agreeable views.\n\u2022 In the aftermath of the terror attack on pilgrims at Amarnath in July 2017, a Twitter account @ShaneMalwa with the name Dr. Abdul Vashisht sent out several hateful tweets against Hindus. Alt News had found that the account was fake.\n\u2022 Zubina Ahmad, who claimed to hail from a defence background was a favourite with right-wing social media users. Zubina\u2019s father had served in the army and her brother in the air force. Her views on most issues were stridently \u2018nationalist\u2019. This account has now been suspended\n\nSuch accounts capitalise on the tendency of social media users to outrage first and verify later, if at all. They also try to reinforce popular narratives, such as endorsement of politicians, political parties and policies. Social media users who are unaware that these accounts are fake fall prey to subtle and not so subtle propaganda. Such accounts keep spawning time and again to target the gullible and further an agenda.", "lang": "en"}
