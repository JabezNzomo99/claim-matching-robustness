Growth has since\n\n, with the most recent official data showing growth of 1.87% between\n\nThis brings the number of quarters with consecutive GDP growth to 12, or 11 \u201csince exiting\u201d recession.\n\n. But the president\u2019s figures for 2018 and 2019 are the average of four quarters, which he then compared to a single quarter of 2020.\n\nIs it correct that this year's dip was only because of the pandemic? We asked experts.\n\nIt is not accurate to attribute the drop entirely to Covid-19, Christopher Ekong, professor of economics at the\n\n\u201cYou can say Covid-19 aggravated it, but the main reason for the drop in GDP growth rate is the drop in oil prices. Our economy is still largely dependent on oil.\u201d There had also been a drop in demand for Nigeria\u2019s oil. Both falls started in the second half of last year.\n\nAnother factor hurting the economy before the pandemic was the fall in regional trade following the closure of the country\u2019s borders, Ekong said. In August 2019 Nigeria\n\nwith Benin, Niger, Chad and Cameroon in an attempt to curb smuggling.\n\nAccording to development economist Prof Tukur Garba, insecurity in northern Nigeria had also affected agriculture, a major contributor to the economy.\n\n\u201cCovid-19 lockdown is a factor, but the security crisis going on in northern Nigeria is a major reason for the drop in GDP growth rate,\u201d Garba, a lecturer at the\n\nAttacks by armed groups including Boko Haram has meant that many farmers in northern food-producing states were displaced. \u201cThis means reduced farming activities, low productivity and high food prices,\u201d Garba said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s economic growth declined on a year-on-year basis from 2.55% in the fourth quarter of 2019, to 1.87% in the first three months of 2020. This underpinned Buhari\u2019s claim that the pandemic had seen a decline in growth for \u201cevery single economy\u201d in the world, and that Nigeria\u2019s had been \u201crelatively moderate\u201d.\n\nDid no economy escape a knock? Not exactly. We identified at least two countries that did not decline,\n\nAt least 18 of the 37 OECD countries had positive growth rates in the first quarter of 2020, but only two \u2013 Chile and Russia \u2013 grew when compared to the last quarter of 2019, the measure considered by Buhari.\n\nChile\u2019s GDP growth rate was -2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2019, and 0.5% in the first quarter of 2020. Russia posted 1.5% year-on-year GDP growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2019, and 1.8% in the first three months of 2020.\n\nOECD data does show consistent declines for its member countries, tying in with\n\nfor global economic growth by the\n\nit is headed for a sharp decline over 2020.\n\nBut at the time Buhari made his claim, data shows he was off the mark for at least two countries.\n\nExternal reserves are also known as foreign exchange reserves,\n\nNigeria\u2019s central bank. These include foreign currency and treasury bonds and are particularly useful should the country\u2019s currency rapidly lose value.\n\nBuhari said this rise was between 29 April and \u201cMay\u201d, but did not give a specific date for May.\n\nCentral bank data shows the country\u2019s gross external reserves were at\n\non 29 April. They increased to $33.89 billion on 4 May and to $36.59 billion on 29 May.\n\nOne month too short for analysis\n\nIt would appear the president was broadly accurate on this score. But there is a caveat \u2013 you cannot use data from one month to determine the state of Nigeria\u2019s external reserves, economics lecturer Prof Sheriffdeen Tella told Africa Check. He teaches at the\n\n\u201cTo get a good picture, you look at a minimum of six months or one year. This is because payment for oil sold is often in the future. So a rise in external reserves this month may be due to proceeds of oil sold months back. Focusing on one month may serve a political purpose,\u201d said Tella.\n\nLonger term data shows the country\u2019s reserves dipped consistently from August 2019 to May 2020, when they started to recover.\n\nExternal reserves are important as they determine a country\u2019s creditworthiness, ability to import and to stabilise its exchange rate, Tella said.\n\nBuhari said the $36 billion in external reserves as of May 2020 could finance seven months worth of imports.\n\nBut this assumed that imports for each month would be of the same approximate value, Prof Sheriffdeen Tella of\n\n\u201cImports vary significantly from month to month. So you can\u2019t really say a certain amount can finance future imports.\u201d\n\n, Buhari highlighted increases in two of Nigeria\u2019s biggest agricultural exports: cocoa and sesame seeds.\n\nThe most recent data from the national bureau of statistics\n\nin the year to March 2020. (\n\nIn the year to March 2019, the country had exported sesame seeds worth N39.6 billion ($129.5 million). This works out to a $31 million increase, against the claim of $153 million by the president.\n\nOver the same period, exports of Nigeria\u2019s various types of cocoa beans were valued at N55.98 billion ($182.94 million)\n\n. The total value of cocoa exports therefore increased by $76.54 million, or about $3 million less than Buhari\u2019s claim.\n\nThere has certainly been\n\nin the value of the two exports in the past year, but the figures provided by the president do not tally with those published by the statistics agency. In the absence of clarification from his office, we rate this claim as unproven.\n\nBuhari\u2019s administration has been keen to highlight the country\u2019s improved ranking on the\n\nEvery year, the bank publishes a report ranking how friendly countries make their economies to investors. The most recent,\n\n. It ranks the economies of\n\nlisted as member states of the United Nations.\n\nNigeria has moved up 25 spots on the ranking, from 146th to 131st. This is the country\u2019s\n\nWe went back 10 years on the index. The president\u2019s term in office started in 2015.\n\nis a 15-spot jump on the previous year, it is the same ranking it had in 2013, when 185 countries were rated.\n\nThe president seemed to be referring to changes in the past year. However, the country moved up 15 places, not 25 as he\n\n. We could not find a 25-spot move. We therefore rate the claim incorrect.\n\nStaying with the World Bank\u2019s ease of doing business ranking, Buhari said Nigeria is now rated among the top 10 reforming countries.\n\nOf the 10 economies which improved the most across three or more areas measured in 2018/19,\n\n. It said the country had improved the ease of starting a business, dealing with construction permits, registering property, getting electricity, cross-border trading and enforcing contracts.\n\nDebate about value of ranking continues\n\n\n\n In March 2020, Africa Check asked experts about the index when researching a similar claim about Mauritius. \n\n\n\n , an international financial services firm, based in Mauritius. She said that the ranking is \u201ca signal that a country gives to the outside world about it\u2019s attractiveness for investment\u201d. \n\n\n\n \u201cIt is key for the financial services sector. It really shows how ready the country is to attract investors or entrepreneurs to come and do business in the country. It means that the government has more or less the right policies to attract investors,\u201d Bhugeloo said. She has previously \n\n\n\n The index has however caused within the World Bank.

They do not necessarily reflect what actually happens in practice and there may be large divergence in some cases between formal law and what takes place on the ground.\u201d \n\n\n\n \u201cWhat the rankings measure are assumptions that a certain formal state of affairs will necessarily bring about economic growth. There is no guarantee that this will be the case\u201d. The debate continues.", "lang": "en"}
