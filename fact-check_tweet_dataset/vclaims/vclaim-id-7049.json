With a distinctive Wisconsin tone, Bryce said: \"Let\u2019s trade places. Paul Ryan, you can come work the iron, and I\u2019ll go to D.C.\"\n\nAt least in Democratic circles, Bryce became a sensation. Ten months later, his prospects improved dramatically when Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House, announced he would not seek re-election to his southern Wisconsin seat.\n\nBut despite Bryce\u2019s everyman image, which he has continued to cultivate in the campaign, a claim he made on the May 6, 2018, edition of \"The Circus,\" a weekly political program on the Showtime cable network, caught our attention.\n\nIt came during this exchange with co-host Mark McKinnon, as Bryce made a reference to President Donald Trump:\n\nBryce: Last year at this time, I was working on a parking structure, and just talking with the co-workers, just really ticked off at what's going on, and they're like, what are you going to do? And I was like, well, I'll show you.\n\n \n\n McKinnon: So you're not a politician?\n\n \n\n Bryce: No, and I think that's what people like. But I mean, people voted for Trump because he was seen as a non-establishment type guy.\n\nNationally, Bryce is a newbie; but this isn\u2019t his first electoral rodeo.\n\nSo, let\u2019s check his claim that he is not a politician.\n\nDictionaries aren\u2019t much help on this claim, given how widely the definitions of politician vary:\n\nBut the more, and more deeply, involved you become in politics, the closer you are to being a politician -- a label many want to avoid.\n\n\"In common current parlance, the word definitely has taken on a pejorative connotation,\" said Wendy Scattergood, a political science professor at St. Norbert College in DePere, Wis. \"People use it as an easy way of calling somebody a bad name.\"\n\nFor Bryce\u2019s part, his campaign defended Bryce\u2019s claim by saying he has been an ironworker and union member for 20 years.\n\nOn one level, it\u2019s easy to argue that the Racine-area resident is not a politician \u2014 he has never held public office.\n\nBut in the space of just over two years, Bryce ran for three different offices, including two that are partisan:\n\n1. August 2012: Bryce lost, 70 percent to 30 percent, in the Democratic primary for an open seat in the Wisconsin Assembly.\n\n2. February 2013: Ten candidates, including Bryce, ran for three seats on the Racine Unified School Board. Four of them, including Bryce, were eliminated in the primary.\n\n3. November 2014: Bryce lost in the general election for an open seat in the state Senate. He was defeated, 61 percent to 39 percent, by a Republican who formerly held the seat.\n\nTo Mordecai Lee, a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee political science professor and former Democratic state lawmaker, Bryce seems more like \"a wanna-be politician.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s easier to say who is a politician,\" Lee said, referring to current elected officials in jobs that pay more or less a full-time salary. \"Short of that, it sort of becomes a rhetorical somersault.\"\n\nBut his current campaign means Bryce is now making his fourth run for public office in six years \u2014 arguably, enough to make him a perennial candidate. And running for Congress is a much larger venture than school board, or even the statehouse.\n\n\"There\u2019s not an obvious point when a person becomes a politician,\" said Barry Burden, a University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist, \"but Bryce has done enough things that he\u2019s clearly moving toward that category.\"\n\n\"If you continue to run, you\u2019re spending a decent amount of effort trying to win public office \u2014 you\u2019re a politician in that case,\" he said, adding: \"If you\u2019re going to spend that much time running for a congressional seat,\" he added, \"that is a full-time job.\"\n\nIndeed, for Bryce to flatly reject the label of politician as he did on Showtime, verges on disingenuous. In the eyes of a typical ironworker who has never run for public office, Bryce\u2019s four runs might make him look very much like a politician. And he hasn\u2019t been working the iron during 2018, his campaign told us, as he runs full time for Ryan\u2019s seat.\n\nMoreover, Bryce\u2019s campaign says it has raised $5.5 million, while winning endorsements from the likes of a former presidenetial candidate -- U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders -- and national unions such as the United Auto Workers.\n\nThat\u2019s high-level stuff, not just a citizen tossing his hat in the ring for a part-time gig on the local school board.\n\nAnd while Bryce hasn\u2019t won public office or held a government position, he has been active in party politics; he is currently chairman of the veterans caucus of the Wisconsin Democratic Party and first vice chairman of the Racine County Democratic Party.\n\nBryce says he is not a politician.\n\nThe ironworker and candidate for Ryan\u2019s U.S. House seat has not been elected to public office and has not held a government position. And there is no universal definition of politician.\n\nBut Bryce, who is active in the Democratic Party, is making his fourth run for public office in the past six years. And his current run is by far the most involved -- as the nearly $5 million he has raised, his national endorsements and leaving his job to campaign full time would attest.\n\nBryce\u2019s statement has some element of truth but is misleading.
