Then, when they had their deal, TPA had the votes to pass. Shortly thereafter, we had a Senate Republican lunch, where I stood and asked the majority leader, very directly: What is the deal that was just cut on TPA and was there a deal for the Export-Import Bank? It was a direct question I asked the majority leader in front of all of the Republican Senators. The majority leader was visibly angry with me that I would ask such a question, and the majority leader looked at me and said: \u201cThere is no deal. There is no deal. There is no deal.\u201d Like Saint Peter, he repeated it three times. He said: \u201cThe only thing I told the proponents of the Export-Import Bank is, like any other Senator in this body, they could offer any amendment they liked on any amendable vehicle, but I gave them nothing.\u201d Following that public discussion, Senator Mike Lee and I approached the majority leader afterward, in which he emphasized: \u201cThere is no deal. I will do nothing. I oppose the Export-Import Bank. All I said is they can offer an amendment like any Senator can to any bill.\u201d\n\nOpponents of the Ex-Im Bank had come armed with amendments to make it difficult for supporters, such as capping the size of loans so that companies such as Boeing would no longer benefit. They had hope, through legislative maneuvering, of getting a vote on the Obamacare repeal that would only require 50 votes for passage, not the normal 60. (Not to get too technical, but others in the Senate dispute this would have been possible.)\n\nBut McConnell used a maneuver known as filling the amendment tree to block all but two amendments\u2014the Ex-Im Bank and the Obamacare care amendment requiring 60 votes. So Cruz and his allies were blocked from doing anything more. (McConnell had indicated he would limit the use of this tactic, but he had already done it a number of times before that morning, according to a Congressional Research Service report.)\n\nFirst of all, if, in fact, the majority leader had somehow misrepresented to the 54 Senators what the facts are with regard to the Ex-Im Bank, I suspect we would find other voices joining that of the junior Senator, but I hear no one else making such a similar accusation. Secondly, I would just say to my colleague that there is an alternative explanation. As the majority leader has said time and time again, anytime 65 Senators want to do something here in the Senate, sooner or later they are going to get their way. Indeed, that represents the vote in support of the Ex-Im Bank\u2014something I will end up voting against but where I realize that majorities will carry the day eventually.\n\nThe emotions surrounding the Ex-Im vote apparently are still raw. But Cruz cannot easily claim that no one disputed his version of events. Cornyn clearly said Cruz was mistaken and that there was an alternative explanation. (We acknowledge that Cornyn did not deal with the accusation that calling up the amendment as McConnell did left no options for opponents of Ex-Im Bank.) Hatch also, with fewer specifics, has said Cruz was wrong, though he did not directly say that at the time.", "lang": "en"}
