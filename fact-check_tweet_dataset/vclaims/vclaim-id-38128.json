Eisenhower, the United States\u2019 34th president and the famed general who served as Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in Europe during World War II. The TPUSA meme featured a picture of Ike along with a putative quotation from him, accompanied by the caption \u201cSocialism Is SLAVERY! #SocialismSucks\u201d:\n\nThe quote attributed to Eisenhower (\u201cIf you want total security, go to prison. There you\u2019re fed, clothed, given medical care and so on. The only thing lacking is freedom.\u201d) was a loose paraphrase of comments the five-star general offered during a speech he delivered in Galveston, Texas, in 1949, shortly after assuming the presidency of Columbia University \u2014 a time in history sandwiched between the defeat of fascism in Europe and the escalating post-conflict Cold War. As reported by the New York Times on Dec. 9, 1949, Eisenhower\u2019s remarks stressed the importance of preserving individual liberty and dignity rather than submitting to totalitarian governments that promised to meet basic protection and material needs:\n\nAccording to the Times, Eisenhower stated that \u201cIf all that Americans want is security, they can go to prison. They\u2019ll have enough to eat, a bed and a roof over their heads. But if an American wants to preserve his dignity and his equality as a human being, he must not bow his neck to any dictatorial government.\u201d\n\nEisenhower also admonished his audience that Americans should vote in all elections, \u201cfrom school board members to presidents,\u201d because \u201cAmerica will never be lost if we vote.\u201d As well, he cautioned against complacency, saying that Americans should be motivated by the same sentiment that prompted Patrick Henry to declare in 1775, \u201cGive me liberty, or give me death.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe owe it to ourselves,\u201d Eisenhower asserted, \u201cto understand the nature of the times and not trade the principles that made this nation great for some panacea dished out by a bureaucrat sitting in an easy chair in Washington.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
