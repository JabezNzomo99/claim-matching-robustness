The partner had not given the United States permission to share the material with Russia.\n\u2022 None After Trump\u2019s meeting, senior White House officials took steps to contain the damage, placing calls to the CIA and the National Security Agency.\n\u2022 None The Post withheld most plot details, including the name of the city, at the urging of U.S. officials who warned that revealing them would jeopardize important intelligence capabilities.\n\nThis is a judgment call, but what White House is going to say the president did something inappropriate? The Post article merely noted some of the possible consequences from Trump sharing the information, but made no judgment on whether Trump had the authority to take the action he took.\n\nMcMaster confirms another key detail in the article \u2014 that Thomas P. Bossert, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, placed calls to the directors of the CIA and the NSA to inform them that the president shared the information to Russia. (The Post also reported that \u201cone of Bossert\u2019s subordinates also called for the problematic portion of Trump\u2019s discussion to be stricken from internal memos.\u201d) It\u2019s a bit strange that McMaster would not have discussed this with one of his key subordinates, so we\u2019re dubious about the credibility of that comment.\n\nAgain, this gets back to the White House trying to push back against the idea that Trump did something wrong. Which White House aide is going to publicly admit that a president\u2019s decision was inappropriate? By naming three officials, McMaster is trying to elevate this point but again it\u2019s a judgment call that does not call into the question the key facts contained in the article.\n\nMcMaster, asked if Trump revealed the city where the intelligence was gathered, again does not deny this specific element of the article. Instead, he says the name would be familiar to anyone reading about the Islamic State. This is an interesting bit of spin because the article says White House officials had specifically asked The Washington Post not to reveal the name of the city.\n\nMcMaster actually has no way of knowing the possible consequences of Trump sharing the information. The Post article noted the concerns of several U.S. officials familiar with the intelligence and how it was gathered, including that Russia could use it to help identify the U.S. ally or intelligence capability involved, especially if it involved intelligence on Russia\u2019s activities in Syria.\n\nThis is deflection. The president would not necessarily know sources of intelligence unless he specifically asked. But intelligence is marked to indicate its sensitivity and whether it can be shared with other countries. So presumably Trump knew that before he shared it with Russia.", "lang": "en"}
