If you look closely, the person is holding some kind of hose.\n\nMr Krouse said: \u201cTherefore, the need for a [protective suit] to prevent back-splash onto his skin and clothing.\u201d\n\nHe added that it wasn\u2019t a 5G tower, but looked like a \u201cstandard 4G tower based on the antennas mounted to it\u201d.\n\nWe showed Arqiva, a communications infrastructure provider in the UK, the image, and asked them whether 5G installers have to wear radiation suits. They told us: \u201cAnyone undertaking works on a telecoms site, including \u2018installing 5G\u2019, would not be required to wear such equipment as the site would be turned off.\u201d\n\nAnd even if it was turned on, they wouldn\u2019t need to wear hazmat equipment.\n\n5G is the next generation of wireless network technology, following on from 4G. Like 4G, 3G and 2G before it, 5G mobile data is transmitted over radio waves\u2014a small part of the whole electromagnetic spectrum (which includes microwaves, visible light and X-rays).\n\nThese radio waves are non-ionising, meaning they don\u2019t damage the DNA inside cells, as X-rays, gamma rays and UV rays are able to do. 5G, although at slightly higher frequencies than previous networks, is still in this radio part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nSuits like the one in the image can protect wearers from biological contaminants (for example when working with people with infectious diseases) or particulates when working with chemicals, but would not protect against ionising radiation as the post suggests.", "lang": "en"}
