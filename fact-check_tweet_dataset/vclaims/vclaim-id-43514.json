The author says he or she is one of many top officials \"working diligently from within to frustrate parts of (Trump\u2019s) agenda and his worst inclinations.\"\n\nPeople inside and outside the White House continue to speculate on the writer\u2019s identity, and some bloggers have jumped on the opportunity to spread misinformation. One example comes from TheLibertyNews.us with this headline: \"BREAKING: White House \u2018Resistance\u2019 mole a fake \u2013 NY Times admits they were trolled.\"\n\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe story was copied word-for-word from one of America\u2019s Last Line of Defense websites, and it attributes the op-ed to Art Tubolls, \"an infamous liberal troll on the Soros payroll.\" Art Tubolls\u2019 anagram Busta Troll is a pen name for Christopher Blair \u2014 the man who runs those sites, which are among the biggest sources of false news online.\n\nIn addition to the fake author, the false article quotes a fake source: \"senior editor John Pragerski.\" The New York Times does not have an editor with that name.\n\nWhile the America\u2019s Last Line of Defense websites call themselves satire, TheLibertyNews.us did not include a disclaimer on its home page or on the story.\n\nWe\u2019ve fact-checked other stories featuring Art Tubolls \u2014 recently he\u2019s appeared as Michael Jordan\u2019s spokesman and as the CEO of Comedy Central. He\u2019s neither, and he\u2019s not the author of the op-ed, either.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
