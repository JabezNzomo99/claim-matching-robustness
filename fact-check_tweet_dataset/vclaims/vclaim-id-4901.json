When opened on Youtube, the video is actually a July 24, 2016 video uploaded by the channel PhTrends showing him delivering a speech at the New Bilibid Prison four days earlier.\n\nDela Rosa is very much alive, and was in the news last week after senators from Guam cancelled a courtesy visit he was supposed to pay them.The lawmakers said being photographed with the former Philippine National Police chief, who was very much involved in the Duterte administration's war on drugs, would \"send the wrong message.\"\n\nThe stopping clip, where a dubious Facebook \"security check\" would pop up before one can continue watching, mirrors the same action that happens in other hoax videos.\n\nJust last month, a stopping video was also the content of the fake report website vira1.gasatentayukuma.com that claimed to show a sex tape between Dela Rosa and his 'mistress.' The video was later found to be a spoof.
