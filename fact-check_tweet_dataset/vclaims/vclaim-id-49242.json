In the viral photo, the kidnapper has been wrongly identified as a JMIU protester, whose identity was left exposed.\n\nThe photo appears to be of a man who was caught while kidnapping children in Egypt.\n\nThe photo, doing the rounds on WhatsApp, has been captioned as, \"Meet Jamia's woman protester.\" (Original text in Hindi: \u092e\u093f\u0932\u093f\u090f \u091c\u093e\u092e\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u092e\u0939\u093f\u0932\u093e protester \u0938\u0947)\n\nStudents across the country have been protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) since last week. Protests turned violent in the JMIU and the Aligarh Muslim University campus after police cracked down on the varsity on Sunday leaving multiple students injured.\n\nThe same photo was sent to BOOM's helpline number for verification.\n\nThe image is viral on Facebook and Twitter with a similar narrative.\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search and found that the photo is of a man who was arrested for allegedly kidnapping children under the guise of a woman in Egypt, two years ago. Upon relevant keyword searches, we were directed to multiple news reports which reported about a young man who donned a burkha to kidnap children, in a gathering that was held in Cairo.\n\nThe accused was caught from a mall located at North 90 Street, gate number 8, Cairo Festival City, by residents, who became suspicious of his movement. He was later handed over to the police.\n\nClick here to access one of the news reports on the incident.", "lang": "en"}
