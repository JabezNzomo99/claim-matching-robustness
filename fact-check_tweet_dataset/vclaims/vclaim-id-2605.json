While these rumors did seem to be rooted in a little truth \u2014 the Clinton campaign was not happy with the questions Lauer asked (or didn\u2019t ask) during the event \u2014 claims that Clinton threw a \u201chissy fit\u201d over it were unfounded.\n\nThe website Victurus Libertas was the first to promulgate this rumor, publishing an article headlined \u201cTemper! Temper! Hillary Goes on Rampage for Over An Hour \u2014 Throwing Glass at Staffer\u2019s Head.\u201d Although Victurus Libertas linked to credible reports from NY Mag and Yahoo! News detailing that Clinton\u2019s campaign was miffed with Lauer for not fact-checking Republican candidate Donald Trump during the event, they cited Politico as their source for the claim that Clinton had thrown a water glass at a staffer:\n\nAnd Politico\u2018s headlines read: \u201cLiberals Lash Out at Lauer, NBC\u201c. It seems to me, no one is \u201clashing out\u201d but Hillary. Hillary\u2019s meltdown included throwing a water glass at a staffer \u2014 narrowly missing her head, and demanding Matt Lauer be fired! She was overheard threatening executives at NBC saying \u201cIf I lose, we all go down and that Fascist Fuck will have us swinging from nooses! What the fuck is wrong with you idiots?\u201d\n\nNone of this information appeared in the cited Politico report, however.\n\nPolitico published an article headlined \u201cLiberals Lash Out at Lauer, NBC,\u201d reporting that Clinton\u2019s campaign and supporters were upset with interviewer Lauer for posing \u201cunbalanced questions\u201d:\n\nBut Politico did not report that Hillary Clinton threw a water glass at anyone\u2019s head, threatened the firing of Matt Lauer, or called Donald Trump a \u201cfascist fuck.\u201d All of that was invented by Victurus Libertas in an apparent attempt to smear the Democratic candidate, and it served as the basis for a longer, highly embellished version of the rumor that began circulating via e-mail in October 2016:\n\nWHAT REALLY HAPPENED AT THE NBC PRESIDENTIAL FORUM WITH MATT LAUER? DEMOCRAT HILLARY CLINTON\u2019S BEHIND THE SCENES TIRADE AFTER NBC\u2019s MATT LAUER ASKED CLINTON ONE QUESTION SHE HAD NOT PRE-APPROVED. VETERAN NBC CAMERAMAN: \u2018YOU REALLY HAD TO SEE THIS TO BELIEVE IT \u2026 SHE CAME APART \u2013 LITERALLY UNGLUED; SHE IS THE MOST FOUL-MOUTHED WOMAN I\u2019VE EVER HEARD \u2026 AND THAT VOICE AT SCREECH LEVEL \u2026 AWFUL!\u2019 \u201cSHE LOOKED SO ENRAGED THAT WE ALL THOUGHT HER HEAD WOULD EXPLODE \u2026 IT WAS A FULL-ON MELT-DOWN, AND THEN SHE SCREAMED SHE\u2019D GET THAT F\u2013\u2013\u2013ING LAUER FIRED FOR THIS. IT WENT ON FOR AT LEAST A HALF HOUR; WE ALL THOUGHT THE EMS WOULD BE THE NEXT CALL.\u201d Behind the scenes, NBC technicians and cameramen at the Wednesday night, Commander-in-Chief Forum (Sept 7) report that Hillary Clinton was so angry and incensed that she had been \u2018blind-sided\u2019 by one question she was not prepared for and had not approved in advance. \u201cWhen her time in front of the cameras ended, Clinton shook the hand Lauer extended to her and smiled once more for the wide camera shot and then Hillary proceeded to pick up a full glass of water and threw it at the face of her assistant and the screaming started. She was in a full meltdown and no one on her staff dared speak with her \u2014 she went kind of manic and didn\u2019t have any control over herself at that point. How these people work with this woman is amazing to me. Most of the small military audience were cordoned off, their seating not close to Mrs. Clinton, but certainly they heard her screaming because it was loud \u2026 and she really didn\u2019t seem to care who heard any of it.\u201d Republican Donald Trump also appeared, in a separate telecast from Hillary Clinton\u2019s and arrived with his two sons but no entourage or assistants in tow. The NBC cameramen involved in his segment said he was a \u2018true gentleman\u2019 and Trump and his sons spoke to everyone and thanked them for inviting him to speak: \u201cIt was a pleasure to answer your questions Matt.\u201d Hillary Clinton\u2019s segment was much different. According to people working on the sidelines, \u201cWhen Matt posed the one legitimate question about the FBI investigation concerning her homemade server and the unsecured emails, we could see she was beginning to boil and her eyes looked to pop.\u201d \u201cIt was toward the end of her interview so she was becoming unglued by the time Lauer finished with questioning. Hillary went ballistic, throwing a huge tantrum and screaming at her staff, \u201cyou f\u2013\u2013\u2013ing idiots, you were supposed to have this thing set up for me and you\u2019ve screwed it up! If that fucking bastard wins we all hang from nooses! Lauer\u2019s finished \u2026 and if I lose it\u2019s all on you ass\u2014-s for screwing this up.\u201d Clinton finally stormed off the military \u2018set\u2019 and the assistant producer said she was screaming that she wanted to talk to \u201cthe idiot who set this mess up \u2026 you do not blindside me \u2013 ever!\u201d and continued to demand to speak with executives at Comcast, parent company to NBC Universal. Her dozen or more aides were visibly disturbed and tried to calm her down when she started shaking uncontrollably. That did not stop her from demanding an executive \u201con the phone, now!\u201d She was told the executive-in-charge of the forum was ready to talk with her and she was led away by two rather large aides who appeared to help her walk. The TV executives got the message with all of the censuring headlines that followed over the next couple of days when it seemed the entire media turned on Matt Lauer for behaving in a \u201cpartisan\u201d manner and \u201cbeing grossly unfair and critical of the former secretary of state.\u201d Matt Lauer was heavily criticized on air by the Clinton campaign the rest of the week with most of the mainstream media joining in. The media appeared to frame Matt\u2019s one serious question as the Clinton campaign was doing\u2026\u201dan unfair and partisan attack on Mrs. Clinton.\u201d Matt Lauer is still facing major backlash following his 23 minutes with Hillary Clinton. Privately, many reporters said Matt handed the Democrat nominee the expected softball questions, but made the decision to ask about the emails because, \u201cthe American people deserve an answer from the former secretary of state.\u201d Calls were made to New York Times, Washington Post and Huffington Post and Twitter executives with orders to \u201cCrush Matt Lauer\u201d. As you can easily see with all the headlines from these MSM sources, they did as they were told by the Clinton campaign. Hillary also screamed that she would be \u201ctreated with respect at the debates or heads will roll.\u201d Staffers at the Clinton campaign report that they fear her wrath and uncontrollable outbursts, and one described Hillary as \u201can egotistical psychopath\u201d. Since Hillary does not allow any staff to have cell phones when she is in their presence, no footage is available, but Hillary will never let this rest. She has made it clear that she wants Matt Lauer to be \u201cpersona non grata \u2013 for putting her on the spot.\u201d Interim DNC chairman Donna Brazile, the first black woman to hold the position, was singled out by Hillary during the rant. She screamed at Donna, \u201cI\u2019m so sick of your face. You stare at the wall like a brain dead buffalo, while letting that f\u2013\u2013\u2013ing Lauer get away with this. What are you good for, really? Get the f\u2013\u2013\u2013 to work janitoring this mess \u2014 do I make myself clear?\u201d A female NBC executive said that Donna Brazile looked at Mrs. Clinton and never flinched, which seemed to enrage Hillary all the more. The executive continued, \u201cIt was the most awful and terrible\u2026and racist display \u2014 such a profane meltdown I have ever witnessed from anyone, and I will never forget it. That woman should never see the inside of the oval office I can tell you that. She was unhinged and just continued to verbally abuse everyone \u2014 she was out of control.\u201d\n\nThe earliest iteration of that longer narrative we could uncover was posted to the message board of the web site MTStars, where it was presented without citations, source information, audio, video, or any other documentation that the described these events actually transpired. It should also be noted that no credible news outlets reported that Clinton went on a cursed-filled tirade after the Commander-in-Chief Forum, or that she threw a water glass at a staffer\u2019s head.\n\nRumors that Clinton threw a \u201ctantrum\u201d after NBC\u2019s Commander-in-Chief Forum started with a fictitious quote, and that narrative was later expanded with more fake quotes from other anonymous sources. Meanwhile, no actual evidence has surfaced to prove that any of these events actually transpired.", "lang": "en"}
