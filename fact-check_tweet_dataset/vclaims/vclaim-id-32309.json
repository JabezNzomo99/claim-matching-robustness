But we know he didn\u2019t write it.\n\n\"The mayor of Livermore California explains Trump\u2019s popularity and success. This is perhaps the best explanation for Trump's popularity,\" said the headline of a June 16, 2018, LinkedIn post shared on Facebook.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe column on Trump was actually written by conservative author Evan Sayet and posted July 13, 2017, on townhall.com. It\u2019s been widely misattributed to Kamena, whose mayoralty ended in late 2011. The current Livermore mayor is John Marchand.\n\nVersions of the LinkedIn headline have appeared elsewhere since 2017 (including the website of an Orlando radio station), claiming that Kamena wrote a good read offering a better understanding of Trump and U.S. politics.\n\nThe posts claim that Kamena is a registered Democrat who \"ran on the Democratic ticket,\" yet is \"as conservative as they come.\" We don\u2019t know Kamena\u2019s political leaning or registration; Livermore local elections are nonpartisan.\n\nPolitiFact tried to get in touch with Kamena but didn\u2019t hear back from him.\n\nThe body of the LinkedIn blog post does not match its headline. The blog post consists of an introductory paragraph followed by the full text of Sayet\u2019s column. In that introduction, the author of the Linked blog post acknowledges in a muddled way that Sayet\u2019s column was \"mistakenly attributed\" to Kamena.\n\nA LinkedIn headline shared on Facebook claimed that the mayor of Livermore, Calif., wrote a column defending Trump.\n\nThe column was written by conservative author Evan Sayet, and misattributed to a former mayor of Livermore.", "lang": "en"}
