The state allows funeral services with limited visitors.\n\nCOVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, has claimed the lives of over 29,000 people in New York to date, according to The New York Times.

There will be no wakes or memorial services to pay your last respects. Every contaminated corpse belongs to the state and will be exposed of in an incinerator.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no evidence to corroborate the post\u2019s claim. No such policy appears in any of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s executive orders, and the New York State Assembly website shows no laws mandating such actions.\n\n\u201cNOTHING stating the State owns any body and will incinerate it upon verification of being infected with Covid-19,\u201d Scott Schmidt, president of the New York State Association of Coroners and Medical Examiners, told FactCheck.org. \u201cFuneral directors, Coroners and Medical Examiners have been briefed on proper handling procedures for such cases as have Cemetery and Crematory Operators.\u201d\n\nAja Worthy-Davis, a spokeswoman for the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, also told FactCheck.org that the claim is \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\nNew York City\u2019s government explicitly states on its website that funeral services are allowed. Jeffrey Hammond, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Health, confirmed to the Daily Caller that \u201cfuneral homes may continue to operate and hold services.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, they should postpone services when possible,\u201d Hammond said in an email. \u201cIf services must be held, funeral homes should limit the size of any services or gatherings to as few participants as possible (e.g. immediate family).\u201d\n\nSome funeral homes have offered live streaming and video conferencing to those beyond immediate family to partake remotely, according to Gothamist.", "lang": "en"}
