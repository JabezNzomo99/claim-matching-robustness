No, that's not true: Articles making the claim offer no quotes, sourcing or details to confirm that anyone associated with the vegan movement has made the claim that stuffing a turkey with bread before cooking it was a sexual assault. In fact, it began as a joke. While PETA produced controversial video ads equating the breeding of farm animals to human sexual assault, we could find nothing relating to grandmother's recipe.\n\nThe story originated from an article (archived here) where it was published by a satire site wokenews.com on Christmas Day, 2018 under the title \"Vegans now claiming that 'stuffing the turkey' to be sexual assault\".

And I feel worthless,\" women in the ad say. But, then, one woman featured in the ad holds up a picture of a cow and says, \"Because I am you -- only different.\" The ad ends with this message: \"Every year, billions of animals are born into the meat, egg, and dairy industry.
