Many Democrats called the collapse of talks unsurprising, but \u201cunfortunate.\u201d They criticized Mr. Trump for a lack of strategy, but urged the administration to continue its efforts. While some Democrats did mock calls for Mr. Trump to receive a Nobel Peace Prize as a result of the diplomatic effort, few if any celebrated or described the scuttled talks as a positive development. Neither Senator Chuck Schumer of New York nor Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leaders in Congress, expressed glee after Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement.\n\nIn a May 17 news conference, Ms. Pelosi criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s use of the term \u201canimals.\u201d The president and the White House maintain he was referring specifically to MS-13 members. Others \u2014 like Ms. Pelosi and many Democrats \u2014 interpreted his comments more broadly. \u201cWhen the president of the United States says about undocumented immigrants, \u2018These aren\u2019t people, these are animals,\u2019 you have to wonder, does he not believe in the spark of divinity, the dignity and worth of every person? \u2018These are not people, these are animals.\u2019 The president of the United States.\u201d Ms. Pelosi did not defend, or even mention, MS-13 or gangs. She clearly said she objected to the term \u201canimals\u201d used to describe undocumented immigrants. Because Mr. Trump phrased his initial May 16 \u201cthese are animals\u201d comment ambiguously, he left room for interpretation. Democrats have been precise in their criticism of his comments: They object to using the term to describe immigrants, not MS-13. The White House did not respond to a request for evidence for Mr. Trump\u2019s claims.", "lang": "en"}
