But it\u2019s not.\n\nIn late June 2020, Facebook users shared a photograph of a mural that showed people of the world wearing masks. The posts claim that the mural was created in 1994 for the Denver International Airport, and the mural proves that the virus was planned.\n\n\"The Denver airport mural painted in 1994. Tell me this is not weird, how far do they plan this stuff in advance?\" text along the bottom of the image reads.\n\nOne user who shared the image wrote: \"And I\u2019m the conspiracy \"theorist\"?! Sorry, but no\u2026\"\n\nAnother said, \"PLANDEMIC 1994 Denver International airport. Illuminati artworks on display.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe mural itself is legitimate. But it\u2019s not from 1994, it\u2019s not in the airport, and it didn\u2019t portend the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThere is some confusion over who created the piece, but we can confirm that it has never been displayed in the Denver International Airport and was made in 2020, not 1994.\n\nThe earliest online appearance of the piece was when CJ Trinidad, an artist in the Philippines, shared it to his Facebook page in February 2020 with the caption \"MASKCOMMUNICATION.\"\n\nHe posted multiple photographs of the artwork, including one of it in progress, and another of him posing with it. His signature appears at the bottom right corner of the piece, and apparel that features the artwork has also been shared on his Facebook account.\n\nBut the same piece was credited to someone named Neha Kumari for a coronavirus-themed global art competition hosted by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. Kumari entered it into the competition under a different title. The image of the mural on the website also shows Trinidad\u2019s signature is cut off.\n\nAuthorship aside, the listed submission date of the artwork on the contest website is where people may have gotten the wrong idea about when it was created.\n\nThe piece is listed on the site as being submitted on Dec. 28, 1995, but this appears to be an error. The competition\u2019s submissions didn\u2019t open until April 2020. We reached out to the organization for clarification but haven\u2019t heard back.\n\nAs for the Denver airport piece of the claim, that\u2019s easy to disprove. Alex Renteria, an airport spokesperson, told PolitiFact that the piece is not from the airport\u2019s collection.\n\n\"The only mural painted in 1994 for DEN featuring international children wearing traditional clothing and that also features flags is Leo Tanguma\u2019s \u2018Children of the World Dream of Peace,\u2019 but none are wearing masks,\" Renteria said.\n\nThe airport opened to the public in February 1995 and has been a hotbed for conspiracy theories for decades, particularly involving its bold, and sometimes unnerving, public art pieces.\n\nFacebook posts claim that a piece of artwork that shows citizens of the world wearing masks was created in 1994 and is displayed in the Denver International Airport.\n\nWhile the original artist is still unclear, the image of the piece does not show a mural that was made in 1994 at the airport.", "lang": "en"}
