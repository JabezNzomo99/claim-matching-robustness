But this data cannot be said to represent the situation on the continent. \n\n\n\nAfrica Check to verify if a claim that as many as 40% of medicines sold in Africa were fake.\n\n\u201cHeard on RFi, 40% of the medicines sold in Africa are fake. My question: are pharmacies concerned?\u201d\n\nWhere could the figure have come from?\n\nAfrica Check contacted RFI for more details about the statistic, including what evidence there was for it.\n\nThe French radio station, which broadcasts to five continents, said that it would be \u201ccomplicated to answer without knowing what content this Twitter account is referring to\u201d.\n\nWe asked the tweet\u2019s author what programme or time he might have heard this on, but he has not yet responded. We will update this article should we hear from him.\n\nWe did find on RFI\u2019s website an\n\n, the president of the\n\nthat took place in Lom\u00e9, the capital of Togo on 17 January 2020 and which focused on the trafficking of fake medicines.\n\nIn the interview, he said: \u201c(...) Togo, where I am currently, acknowledges that there are roughly 40% of fake medicines available\u201d.\n\nWe were however unable to establish if this was what the tweet in question had been referring to.\n\nIt is a statistic that is quoted often\n\nIt is a well travelled claim. An\n\nsays that \u201caccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 40% of the medicines sold in Africa are fake\u201d.\n\nThe article is dated October 2019, three months before the Lom\u00e9 summit.\n\npublished in 2017, the WHO notes that \"for many years, the response to this important threat to public health was embroiled in the discussion of complex definitions that meant different things to different people\".\n\nThe study says that the term fake medication\n\u2022 None Substandard medical products: also called \"out of specification\": these are authorized medical products that fail to meet either their quality standards or their specifications, or both.\n\u2022 None Unregistered/unlicensed medical products: Medical products that have not undergone evaluation and/or approval by the national or regional regulatory authority for the market in which they are marketed/distributed or used, subject to permitted conditions under national or regional regulation and legislation.\n\u2022 None Falsified medical products: Medical products that deliberately/fraudulently misrepresent their identity, composition or source. \n\n\n\nWHO\u2019s database includes two types of drugs: fakes and those below the required quality standards, Dr\n\n, an associate professor at the\n\nand author of the study, said.\n\nThis, she said, means that the data does \"not distinguish clearly between the two, although they are really quite different, as are the mechanisms that drive them\".\n\nWHO doesn't say 40% of drugs sold in Africa are fake\n\nThe study stated that \"42% of all fake medicines that were reported between 2013 and 2017 came from Africa\".\n\nPisani told Africa Check that it was important to understand the difference between the statement \u201c42% of medicines in Africa are fake\u201d and \u201c42% of the fake medicines reported to our system come from Africa\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe WHO data is based on a case reporting system. That means that it counts whatever is reported to it, but what is reported is not, repeat not, representative of what is actually out there,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nTo better explain the situation, Pisani gave a practical example.\n\n\u201cImagine that Senegal finds 10 cases of fake medicines in a year, and reports all of them to WHO. Bangladesh finds 100 cases in a year, but only reports the five cases that were discovered by journalists and became public knowledge.\n\n\u201cSo now the WHO database would have 15 cases in its database, 66% of them from Senegal. In reality, there are 110 cases, only 9% of them from Senegal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an imaginary example, but it illustrates the limitations of the WHO database. At the time of that report, 42% of all reported cases were from Africa,\u201d Pisani said. The report notes that this in part is because the heath agency\n\n\u201d to identify and report cases, meaning there \u201cis more reporting from Africa\u201d.\n\n\"This figure (42%) does not represent the real proportion of what is out there.\"\n\nin the global surveillance and monitoring system for substandard and falsified medical products at WHO.\n\nince 2013, WHO has been receiving reports of substandard and falsified medical products from the national focal points. These reports are then pooled in a single global database\n\n\u201cThis database leverages qualitative and quantitative data to assist in incident handling, understanding the driving forces of substandard and falsified medical products and developing appropriate solutions,\u201d Esteve said.\n\nthe global system is a case reporting database and cannot be used to extrapolate prevalence nor incidence rates\u201d.\n\n\u2018\u201cThe 42% figure refers to the reporting levels from the African region to this global system (and not the prevalence)\u201d, she said.\n\nContinent-wide data not yet available\n\nPisani told Africa Check that the WHO \u201cdid sponsor studies of the quality of antibiotics in six African markets in 2019, but the results are not yet available\u201d.\n\nThere are other studies of narower scope,\n\n, head of the nephrology division at\n\n10 mainly West Africa countries. This found that nearly a quarter of the available generic antihypertensive medicines are of poor quality.\n\nConclusion: No evidence that 40% of medicines sold in Africa are fake\n\nA much travelled claim holds that \u201c40%\" or some similar share of the medicines sold in Africa are fake.\n\nSome sources have attributed this statistic to the World Health Organization. The global health agency did in a study published in 2017 find that \u201c42% of all fake medicines reported to them between 2013 and 2017 came from Africa\u201d.\n\nBut the study\u2019s author told Africa Check that this figure does not represent how prevalent fake medicines are on the continent, but rather the cases that were reported to the WHO.\n\nAs such, this study cannot be used as evidence for the claim. There still isn\u2019t research that can be said to be representative of the continent.\n\nThis was after a user on Twitter in January 2020 said that he had come across this statistic on Radio France Internationale (RFI).", "lang": "en"}
