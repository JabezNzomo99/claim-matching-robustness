He also falsely claimed the coalition has not been regularly providing the public with the information about airstrikes.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "December 28, 2017", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-7744", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-syria-us/28944455.html", "vclaim": "In an interview with the Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda published on December 26, Russia\u2019s top general, Valery Gerasimov, who is chief of the general staff of the country's armed forces, answered questions regarding Russia\u2019s military operation in Syria.\n\nDespite the lengthy interview, General Gerasimov provided little new information beyond stating that \u201c[m]ore than 48,000 soldiers and officers have gone through the Syrian campaign,\u201d and adding that a quarter of them had received awards for their service in Syria. Yet this information gave the lie to the long-standing claim by the Kremlin and Defense Ministry that Russian troops had not been taking part in the ground operations in Syria -- a claim Polygraph.info has previously debunked.\n\nThe newspaper's reporter asked Gerasimov: \u201cThe information department of the Russian Defense Ministry and the General Staff has practically daily informed the public after almost every missile/bomb attack on the terrorists in Syria. Why, in your view, hasn\u2019t the American coalition behaved in a similar fashion?\u201d\n\nThe general responded: \u201cAbout eight months ago, they also started to inform, to provide a summary. Of course, the difference is fundamental. They [do it] from time to time, but we [do it] on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition\u2019s mission against Islamic State, called the Combined Joint Task Force \u201cOperation Inherent Resolve,\u201d started releasing information on every airstrike in January 1, 2015, not \u201ceight months ago,\u201d and the reports are as detailed as it gets -- not \u201csummaries,\u201d as Gerasimov claims.\n\nThe coalition's \u201cStrike Release\u201d reports have been issued and published on a daily basis, not \u201cfrom time to time,\u201d as Gerasimov says. Every day of \u201cOperation Inherent Resolve\u201d since January 2015 to the present has been accounted for transparently, and the reports are available to the public.\n\nPolygraph.info has done multiple fact-checks debunking the claims repeated by Valery Gerasimov in his interview. Here are just a few examples.\n\nFALSE: \"It seems to me that the coalition did not set as an objective, neither at that time nor now, the final defeat of ISIS.\"\n\nFALSE: \u201cIt is actually ISIS. But after the work done with them [by the U.S. instructors], they change their colors, take another name \u2013 the 'New Syrian army' and others. Their objective is to destabilize the situation.\u201d\n\nFALSE: \u201cSomewhere 25 kilometers west of al-Tanf there are more than 50,000 Syrian refugees. The Center for Reconciliation was created as part of the Russian military group in Syria, which is in fact coordinating and directing the delivery of all humanitarian aid, humanitarian convoys -- our Russian ones, U.N ones. These convoys go everywhere, but it is not working out in Rukban: the Americans do not allow them there - neither Syrian nor other convoys. The people are suffering.\u201d\n\nMISLEADING: \u201cWe broke the backbone of ISIL in Syria. In fact, our armed forces have routed the enemy.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
