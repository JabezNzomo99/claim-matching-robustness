In this case, Lester Holt correctly presented the facts about stop and frisk. Trump has called on a national stop-and-frisk policy, praising former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for enacting the policy and driving down crime rates. (We awarded Three Pinocchios to his claims attributing 20 years of crime decline to the stop-and-frisk policy under Giuliani.)\n\nThe important distinction here is that stop and frisk as a tactic is constitutional. The way it was applied in New York City, and as it was challenged in the lawsuit that Trump and Holt were referring to, was found unconstitutional. For this reason, there has been some confusion in news coverage about this. We dug into the facts.\n\nBlacks and Hispanics who were stopped by New York police sued the city, arguing that the use of stop and frisk violated their constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment (prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure) and that they were targeted for stops in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Plaintiffs weren\u2019t seeking the city to end the practice, and did not argue about its effectiveness in addressing crime. Instead, they requested the policy be changed so that it stays within constitutional limits.\n\nIn 2013, U.S. District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin, in the Southern District of New York (which covers Manhattan, the Bronx and some other counties), issued a 195-page ruling in favor of the plaintiffs. She found the city liable for violations of the plaintiffs\u2019 rights under the Fourth and 14th amendments. Scheindlin laid out the facts:\n\nShe concluded her ruling by quoting New York Times columnist Charles Blow: \u201cThe idea of universal suspicion without individual evidence is what Americans find abhorrent and what black men in America must constantly fight. It is pervasive in policing policies \u2014 like stop-and-frisk, and \u2026 neighborhood watch \u2014 regardless of the collateral damage done to the majority of innocents. It\u2019s like burning down a house to rid it of mice.\u201d\n\nAs Trump says, Scheindlin was removed from the case on appeal. But it wasn\u2019t related to her being a \u201cvery against-police judge.\u201d A federal appeals court found that Scheindlin gave an appearance of bias by using a legal maneuver to hear the case in her court, and by giving news interviews. Bloomberg\u2019s administration praised the decision, saying Scheindlin \u201cendangered public safety with an anti-police mindset.\u201d\n\nBut by the time de Blasio became mayor, stop and frisk was already on its way out. The number of stops declined after the peak in 2011, and in 2013, there were fewer than 200,000 stops. In 2014, there were just under 46,000, according to NYPD data. Last year, there were 22,939 stops, the New York Times reported.\n\nAnd while the number of recorded stops decreased through 2013, the crime continued to fall \u2014 calling into question how effective the stops have been in decreasing crime. If the practice had a direct impact on crime, one would assume the crime rate would soar after police ended the stops.\n\nData showed that while blacks or Hispanics were not more likely than whites to carry guns or drugs, they were being stopped at extremely disproportionate rates, said Faiza Patel, co-director of the Liberty and National Security team at New York University Law School\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice. Plus, gun recovery rates over the course of stop and frisk did not match the increase in stops through 2011, Patel said.\n\nThe Center for Constitutional Rights, which argued the case on behalf of the plaintiffs, issued a statement confirming that the practice was found unconstitutional in the 2013 case. But NYPD rejected the claim that stop and frisk is unconstitutional. In a statement, the agency acknowledged Scheindlin ordered remedies to ensure the agency \u201capplies the lawful policing tool constitutionally.\u201d\n\nTrump is incorrect: Stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York. By the time de Blasio dropped the appeal, the practice was already on its way out, although it continued through last year. There is a court-appointed monitor working with NYPD to ensure that the practice is within constitutional limits.\n\nThere has been some confusion about this issue in news coverage. Stop and frisk as a tactic is constitutional. But the way the tactic was applied in New York City has been found unconstitutional. This is an important distinction.\n\nTrump said the argument for stop and frisk was that \u201cwe have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn\u2019t have them.\u201d As noted earlier, police found a weapon in 1.5 percent of all frisks.", "lang": "en"}
