Among those who shared the clip is Madhu Kishwar.\n\nThe video is massively viral on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nFacebook page \u092d\u093e.\u091c.\u092a\u093e : Mission 2019 posted a video on January 2 titled \u2013 \u2018\u092a\u093e\u0915\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0941\u0913 \u0915\u093e \u0939\u093e\u0932 (The condition of Hindus in Pakistan)\u2019 and captioned it as \u2013 \u2018\u0907\u0938 \u0935\u093f\u0921\u093f\u092f\u094b \u0915\u094b \u0926\u0947\u0916\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0926 \u0906\u092a\u0915\u0940 \u092d\u0940 \u0906\u0901\u0916\u0947 \u092d\u0930 \u091c\u093e\u092f\u0947\u0917\u0940,\u0939\u094b \u0938\u0915\u0947 \u0924\u094b \u0915\u0941\u091b \u0914\u0930 \u0932\u094b\u0917\u094b \u0915\u094b \u091c\u0917\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0928\u093e (Even your eyes will water after watching this video. If possible, wake others up too.)\u2019. At the time of writing this article, the video had 1.3 million views and nearly 40,000 shares.\n\nThe 3:19-minute video shows police entering people\u2019s homes by force and thrashing them with lathis. The women can be heard wailing while the men of the family are taken away. Later parts of the video show more violence instilled on the public. A few other Facebook pages (Narendra Modi PM 2019 and\u092c\u091c\u0930\u0902\u0917 \u0926\u0932 \u2013 \u091a\u094c\u092e\u0942\u0902 \u0928\u0917\u0930) also claimed that the incident portrayed the treatment of Hindus in Pakistan.\n\nA Twitter user Dinesh Joshi, who is followed by Prime Minister Modi and Railway Minister Piyush Goyal\u2019s Office, had tweeted the same video in January 2018. He claimed that a Hindu was thrashed in Pakistan for hoisting a saffron flag on his house.\n\nIn January last year, the video was also viral with the same narrative in Telugu.\n\nFact-check: 2013 video; DOES NOT depict atrocities on Hindus\n\nUpon breaking the video into multiple frames using InVid software and reverse-searching one of the frames on Google, we landed on several fact-check stories. BBC, Boomliveand Hoax or Facthave debunked the video in the past.\n\nBBC spoke to one of its correspondents from Islamabad who informed that the video does not depict Hindus being beaten in Pakistan. It pertains to an incident that took place in Faisalabad in Pakistan\u2019s Punjab province in 2013.\n\nPakistani media Dunya News, Geo TVand The Express Tribunehad reported the event where citizens were thrashed by personnel of Pakistan\u2019s \u2018Elite Forces\u2019.\n\nAccording to Dunya News, \u201c\u2026during a protest against electricity load-shedding in Faisalabad, police entered the houses of protesters and manhandled their women.\u201d\n\nBBC Islamabad correspondent Umar Daraz informed that Faisalabad is prone to electricity shortages but in 2013 the situation turned dire. People took to the streets in protests after complaining of power outages for 14-16 hours a day.\n\n\u201cThey had resorted to throwing stones and had also burned down a FESCO office, after which police officers abused and assaulted the protesters,\u201d per a June 2013 Express Tribunereport. Three police personnel Babar Masih, Tauseef Ahmed, Abid Hussain were suspended after police excess on Muslim families.\n\nThe video of Pakistani \u2018Elite Forces\u2019 cracking down upon protesting citizens was, thus, viral as \u2018Hindus beaten in Pakistan\u2019.\n\nThe man behind the video \u2013 Santosh Srivastava\n\nIf one notices closely, the video shared by several Facebook pages carries a stamp (in the image below).\n\nUpon scrolling through \u092d\u093e.\u091c.\u092a\u093e : Mission 2019, we found that a similar stamp has been used in several of its posts. In one of the them, the stamp carried the name \u2013 \u2018Santosh Srivastava\u2019 and this led us to the Facebook profile of the creator of the video.\n\nSrivastava is associated with a plethora of Facebook pages that churn out misinformation and pro-BJP propaganda posts on a regular basis. One of his most popular pages \u2013 \u092c\u093e\u0930 \u092c\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u2013 Modi Forever \u2013 has over 37 lakh followers. Some of the other pages and groups he is associated with are \u2013 WE SUPPORT PM MODI (20+ lakh members), NAMO (45+ lakh followers), I Support Yogi (8+ lakh members), I M With Namo (20+ lakh followers) and Youth 4 UP (13+ lakh followers).\n\n\u2018Hindus beaten in Pakistan\u2019 video viral since 2014 with varied narratives\n\nAn incident where the Pakistani Elite Forces cracked down upon its own people was recently viral in the Indian social media sphere, attempting to show police brutality on the country\u2019s minority Hindu community.\n\nThe claim propagated by Santosh Srivastava wasn\u2019t the sole false narrative floating on the internet. The video has been doing rounds with distorted facts in other countries as well. A Persian website \u2018Shia News Association\u2019 in 2014 claimed that it depicted Pakistani police excess on Afghan refugees.\n\nIn 2015, the video was circulated with the claim that it portrayed Pakistani police brutality on Christians. From a YouTube handle \u2018Peace Worldwide\u2019, it attracted over 95,000 views. A Twitter user from Europe, who is followed by Railway Minister Piyush Goyal\u2019s Office, also shared the identical video with the \u2018Christian\u2019 narrative, but in 2017.\n\nProvocative claims circulated on social media are often veiled behind disinformation. It is, therefore, pertinent that social media consumers perform a basic fact-check and not blindly trust the narrative.", "lang": "en"}
