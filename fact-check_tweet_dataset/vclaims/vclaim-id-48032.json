I\u2019m just in their way.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nSearching for the quote online, we found several posts on meme websites but no credible sources connecting Trump to the statement.\n\nWe also didn\u2019t find any coverage of Trump making such a statement in the Nexis news archive.\n\nCertainly, Trump has accused liberals for attacking Christian values.\n\n\"In recent years, the hard left has tried to muzzle Christian voices in their aggressive attack on free speech,\" he said during an address at the Values Voter Summit on Oct. 12.\n\nIn the same speech, he also said:\n\n\"On every front, the ultra-left is waging war on the values shared by everyone in this room. They are trying to silence and punish the speech of Christians and religious believers of all faiths.\"\n\n\"The grave danger posed to historic Christian communities is incredible.\"\n\nWhat he didn\u2019t say is what appears in the Facebook post.\n\nIf evidence surfaces that Trump did make this statement, we\u2019ll reconsider our rating. Until then, we rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
