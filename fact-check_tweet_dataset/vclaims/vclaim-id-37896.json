This is false -- the woman is the baby\u2019s great-grandmother -- and follows on the heels of a similar hoax report that AFP debunked last year.\n\nThis Facebook post, published on November 8, 2019, has clocked up more than 121,000 shares.\n\nIt describes how an elderly woman gave birth at the age of 103 after \u201cmany years of praying, fasting and crying\u201d.\n\nThe claim has also appeared here, here and here since 2018.\n\nIn the past, the picture has been published alongside at least two more false claims, one of them debunked here by AFP in November last year.\n\nAnother claim (here, here and here) accompanying this photo told readers of a controversial ovarian transplant procedure that doctors purportedly carried out on 101-year-old Italian Anatolia Vertadella, allowing her to fall pregnant and give birth.\n\nA \u201cDr Alexandro Popolicchi\u201d was named as the medical expert behind the procedure and a photo purportedly showing him featured a bearded man in hospital scrubs.\n\nBut a Google reverse image search revealed the image was that of Dr Sherman Silber, the managing director of The Infertility Center of St Louis in the United States.\n\nThe story of \u201cAnatolia Vertadella\u201d was first debunked in 2016 by Snopes but continued to circulate online.\n\nThe Huffington Post reported that Rosa Camfield was 101 when the now-famous picture was taken of her by her granddaughter Sarah Hamm in March 2015, two weeks after Hamm delivered baby Kaylee. Hamm was interviewed by The Huffington Post and multiple other US news outlets.\n\nThe image made its way to a Facebook page called Life of Dad, where it went viral with more than 79,000 shares.\n\nCamfield died less than two weeks after the picture shot around the world, sparking renewed media interest (see here, here and here).", "lang": "en"}
