The claim is false; the image shows a music festival in Berlin in 2003.\n\nThe image was published in this Facebook post on August 30, 2020.\n\nThe German text overlay on the image translates to English as: \u201c4 million people in Berlin!!!\u201d\n\nThe post reads in part: \u201cWAY TO GO BERLIN!!! 4 million people protested against - CV scam, masks, governments breaking all Geneva conventions, vax, lockdowns, 5G and more in Berlin yesterday!!\u201d\n\nThe posts circulated online just one day after thousands gathered in Berlin to protest against coronavirus restrictions on August 31, 2020. Some 18,000 people gathered at Berlin Brandenburg Gate, before the rally was forced to stop due to a police injunction because many were not respecting social distancing measures, as reported here by AFP.\n\nThe image was also shared here and here on Facebook in August 2020. It also circulated in Facebook posts in Spanish and Portuguese, alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim, however, is false; the photo was taken in 2003.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found an identical photo published here on the website for the Nineties Berlin museum. The article describes an exhibit commemorating the 30th anniversary of Love Parade, a music festival hosted in Berlin.\n\nThe photo, dated 2003, is credited to Matthias Roeingh, a German DJ also known as Dr. Motte. The photo was published with the same attribution on Motte's personal blog here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the image in the misleading post (L) and the photo on the Nineties Berlin website (R):\n\nAccording to this article by German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel published on July 13, 2003, police estimated at least 500,000 people attended the Love Parade music festival that year in Berlin.", "lang": "en"}
