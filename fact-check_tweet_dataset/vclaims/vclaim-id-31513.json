It has also been confirmed while the U.S. was hitting its climate goals, at the same time \u201980 percent of the increase in CO emissions came from Asia and that China and India both contributed significantly\u2019 to global increases.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 11, the right-leaning Washington Examiner wrote that \u201cU.S. emissions fell 2.9%, or by 140 million tons, continuing the trend of the United States leading the world in total emissions decline since 2000.\u201d That prompted Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, to tweet:\n\n\u201cFACT you will NEVER see on the 6 o\u2019clock news: U.S. emissions FELL 2.9%, or by 140 million tons, continuing the trend of the United States LEADING THE WORLD IN TOTAL EMISSIONS DECLINE since 2000.\u201d\n\nBased on the data contained in the International Energy Agency\u2019s (IEA) February 2020 report, it would be accurate to say that in 2019 the U.S. had the largest year-on-year reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of any country, in absolute terms.\n\nHowever, claiming \u2014 as The Daily Wire and Breitbart did \u2014 that the U.S. had \u201cled the world\u201d or was \u201cthe global leader\u201d in reducing emissions that year, risked giving readers the mistaken impression that the U.S. had performed better than any country when it came to reducing CO emissions. This was not the case, because the U.S. reduced its CO emissions by just 2.9%, while other countries and regions fared better. Germany, for example, achieved a year-on-year reduction of 8% in its CO emissions.\n\nThe source of the aforementioned claims was the IEA Feb. 11 data release entitled \u201cGlobal CO Emissions in 2019.\u201d The IEA told Snopes that a more detailed, country-by-country breakdown of emissions data was not yet available, but would be published in March. However, some country- and region-specific details were already clear.\n\nAccording to the report, the overall global trend was as follows:\n\n\u201cGlobal energy-related CO emissions flattened in 2019 at around 33 gigatonnes (Gt), following two years of increases. This resulted mainly from a sharp decline in CO emissions from the power sector in advanced economies, thanks to the expanding role of renewable sources (mainly wind and solar PV), fuel switching from coal to natural gas, and higher nuclear power output.\u201d\n\nAlthough advanced economies (a category that includes the U.S., the European Union, Australia, Japan, Canada, and others) experienced positive economic growth in 2019, energy-related CO emissions also fell, on average, in those countries and regions.\n\nThe U.S. produced around 4.8 Gt (gigatons/billions of tons) of CO in 2019. That was 140 Mt (megatons/millions of tons) fewer than it produced in 2018 \u2014 the biggest single absolute reduction in energy-related CO emissions by any country. The U.S. produced around 2.9% less CO in 2019 than it did in 2018.\n\n\u201cUS emissions are now down almost 1 Gt from their peak in the year 2000, the largest absolute decline by any country over that period. A 15% reduction in the use of coal for power generation underpinned the decline in overall US emissions in 2019. Coal-fired power plants faced even stronger competition from natural gas-fired generation, with benchmark gas prices an average of 45% lower than 2018 levels. As a result, gas increased its share in electricity generation to a record high of 37%. Overall electricity demand declined because demand for air-conditioning and heating was lower as a result of milder summer and winter weather.\u201d\n\nThe large absolute reduction in CO emissions in the United States in 2019 is in part a function of the sheer volume of CO produced there (which is in part determined by the large size of the U.S. economy). By contrast, its rate of emissions reduction was not as significant as that achieved in other countries and regions. For example, the IEA report explained that Germany achieved a year-on-year reduction in CO emissions of 8%, while Japan\u2019s emissions fell by 4.3% \u2014 significantly greater rates of decline than the 2.9% achieved in the U.S.\n\nDespite having an overall CO output that is almost 40% smaller than that of the United States (2.9 Gt vs 4.8 Gt), the European Union still managed to achieve a greater absolute reduction in emissions than the U.S. in 2019 (160 Mt vs 140 Mt). That was because emissions fell at a significantly greater rate in the EU than in the U.S. (5% versus 2.9%).\n\nIt\u2019s true that, according to the IEA\u2019s February 2020 report, the U.S. achieved a greater absolute reduction in CO emissions than any other country, in 2019. However, claims that the U.S. therefore \u201cled the entire world\u201d or was a \u201cglobal leader\u201d in CO emissions were belied by the fact that other countries (including Germany, Japan, and likely others) achieved a superior rate of reduction in CO emissions. Although not a country, the European Union achieved both a larger absolute reduction and a greater rate of reduction in CO emissions than the US did.\n\nAs such, we\u2019re issuing a rating of \u201cMixture.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
