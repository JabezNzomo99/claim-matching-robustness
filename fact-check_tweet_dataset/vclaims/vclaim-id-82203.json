Johnson had left the nation with \u201cthe same poverty rates\u201d and 45 million people in poverty. And, then, there was a Democrat saying that without that effort, 40 million more Americans would be in poverty.\n\nSo what does Ryan mean when he says \u201cwe still have the same poverty rates\u201d as when the war on poverty was launched 50 years ago. A spokesman said that he was referring to the official poverty rate. Sure enough, the Census Bureau (see page 12) shows it was about 15 percent in 1965 and it is now about 15 percent. The number of people below the poverty line is about 45 million, as Ryan said.\n\nFor instance, transfer payments, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or food stamps, are not recorded as income, meaning that the impact of programs for the poor is not reflected in the official estimate. (This makes it especially difficult to assess whether these programs actually help fight poverty.) The Census Bureau has tried to mitigate these concerns with a new Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), introduced in 2011, but that has come under attack as well.\n\nBruce D. Meyer and James X. Sullivan, in a paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research, also forcefully argued that the rate was both higher when the \u201cwar\u201d was launched and is significantly lower than the official rate now, largely because of changes in tax policies. (See the charts starting on page 51.)\n\nThis is what Van Hollen was referring to when he claimed that \u201cif you did not have the Great Society war on poverty, 40 million more Americans would be in poverty.\u201d He was basing that figure on the Supplemental Poverty Measure, according to the communications director Bridgett Frey, citing calculations in the 2014 report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers. The report reassessed poverty rates over time using the SPM.\n\nSwift added: \u201cThe point is that none of us should be satisfied with the status quo, and we need to rework our poverty fighting strategies so that we\u2019re focusing on outcomes and results \u2014 getting people out of poverty and making that OPM rate decline \u2014 rather than inputs \u2014 how much money we spend or how many new programs we create.\u201d\n\nIncreasingly, the official poverty measure is considered inadequate for assessing whether efforts to fight poverty have been effective over time. In particular, it seems odd to rely on a measure that does not include some of the most effective anti-poverty programs around, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. (In fact, Ryan has called for expanding the EITC.)\n\nOn the one hand, Ryan is referring to an official statistic from the Census Department. But at the same time he must know that Census is not especially pleased with it, which is why the agency has introduced an alternative measure. If Ryan had concerns about the methodology, then presumably his spokesman would identify them rather than duck our questions.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit slick for Ryan to suggest the war on poverty has been a failure while touting an improvement in an anti-poverty program that is not captured in the statistic he cites. At the very least, he should acknowledge, as Van Hollen does, that the numbers can change depending on the measure that is used. He earns Two Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
