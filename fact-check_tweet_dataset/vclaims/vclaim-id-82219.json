The above headline and survey caught the attention of one of our readers, who was skeptical about the facts. The implication that federal employees in Washington spent Memorial Day binge-watching NSFW material also led to some social media buzz around the holiday.\n\nThere, indeed, have been instances where federal employees were found to have viewed pornographic Web sites at work. A recent watchdog report found the Environmental Protection Agency was not promptly punishing employee misconduct, including cases where employees watched porn on government computers. But what exactly did the survey on computer viruses in Washington find? Does it relate to the topic of federal employees\u2019 use of government devices, or their activities on government time?\n\nThe survey of the four cities looked at the average number of daily infections for the month leading up to a federal holiday, and compared it with the number of infections detected on a federal holiday. The company found that Washington had the highest spike in malware on federal holidays in the past two years. Colorado Springs ranked second, and the level in the other two cities were not significant enough to warrant a good comparison of data, according to the company\u2019s spokesman, Ryan Gerding.\n\nThe 51 percent spike in Washington was much higher compared with the overall spike on federal holidays, which is about 30 percent, the company said. The highest spike in Washington was on Veterans Day, at 92 percent. The lowest was on Christmas, at 23 percent. Memorial Day ranked second, at 63 percent.\n\nThey measured this by looking at computers that downloaded the company\u2019s anti-virus software. The company declined to say exactly how many computers had downloaded the software in the four cities. But Gerding said there were at least 1,000 infections per day on average in Washington during the time of the survey, which does not necessarily mean the infections were on 1,000 separate computers.\n\nThere also is no way to know exactly what caused the viruses. It could be adult content, but it also could be anything that was linked to a virus. That means spam mail, a link in a hacked social media account, as a part of illegally downloaded movies and shows, a bogus \u201cupdate\u201d to a program in your computer, etc.\n\nThe company wanted to examine infection rates when there is an anticipated increase in the number of people who are home or on their computers than usual, Gerding said. The assumption is that people who are stuck at home spend more time online. So in studying infection rates on federal holidays, the company specifically looked at cities where there would be a higher number of people spending the day off work on those days. \u201cWhat we were interested in was not so much the overall infection rate of a particular city, but how big of a spike over that city\u2019s average there was on a specific federal holiday,\u201d Gerding said.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the worst: that the 51 percent spike in infections in D.C. on federal holidays was all from federal employees, and that there was one computer per infection. If there was an average of 1,000 infections per day in Washington, a 51 percent spike would mean 1,510 infections. Compare that with the total number of federal employees in Washington: about 203,000, as of 2013. That means less than 1 percent of federal workers were affected by malware, whatever the source of the virus may be.\n\nThere is an effort in Congress to ban porn viewership by federal employees on government-owned devices. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) introduced the Eliminating Pornography from Agencies Act after revelations that some employees downloaded pornographic files to their computers. But since the EnigmaSoftware study relates to personal computers, it does not relate to this bill, said Meadows\u2019s spokeswoman.\n\nThis combination of a catchy headline and a narrow survey could lead to public misperception about this issue. There is no proof in this study that shows causation between federal employees and porn viewership. The study only looked at four cities, so there is no telling how Washington\u2019s infection rate on federal holidays compares with other cities that do not have a high concentration of federal employees.\n\nAs regular readers of The Fact Checker know, we are skeptical of click-bait, bite-size summaries that easily can be shared, and misconstrued, on social media. The nuances of the findings become clearer in the news article, beyond the headline. But it takes some digging to understand what exactly the survey found, and what it means. We challenge the public and the media to dig deeper \u2014 especially when it sounds too scandalous to be true.", "lang": "en"}
