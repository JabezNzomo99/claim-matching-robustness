Two officers were fired after video of the encounter was broadcast by a local television station. The president apparently saw this segment on One America News Network (OANN), a television network that leans more to the right than Fox News. It put a different spin on the situation.\n\nNotice the accent of reporter, Kristian Brunovich Rouz? He\u2019s originally from Siberia. The Daily Beast reported in 2019 that while working for OANN, he also has been writing for Sputnik, a Kremlin news service that U.S. intelligence agencies said was implicated in the Russian efforts to intervene in the 2016 election on behalf of Trump.\n\nRouz cites as his source \u201cThe Conservative Treehouse,\u201d in particular a blog post by an unidentified person labeled \u201cSundance.\u201d The blog post claimed Gugino is a \u201cprofessional agitator and Antifa provocateur.\u201d (The evidence supposedly is Gugino listing on his personal blog that he has been arrested \u2014 but not convicted \u2014 four times between 2009 and 2016 for participating in protests, including twice in front of the White House during the Obama administration.)\n\nTrump has claimed without evidence that \u201cAntifa\u201d \u2014 a loose collection of \u201canti-facist\u201d activists who originally sprung up to challenge white supremacists \u2014 is responsible for the violence that sometimes took place during protests against police brutality. But there is no apparent connection to Gugino and Antifa.\n\nGugino\u2019s attorney Kelly V. Zarcone told WKBW in a statement that her client is a \u201clongtime peaceful protester and human rights advocate.\u201d Gugino, who remains in the hospital, is a member of two nonprofits: PUSH Buffalo, which focuses on affordable housing, and Western New York Peace Center, a human rights organization. He is also part of the Catholic Worker Movement, a nonviolent group.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a gentle person who really believes that he must stand up for what he thinks is right,\u201d said a friend Terrence Bisson, who has worked with Gugino on Latin American issues through the Western New York Peace Center, in an interview with the Buffalo News.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why he went to the demonstration. He would never resist physically any kind of orders,\u201d Bisson said. \u201cHe\u2019s a bit frail, not because of his age. He has some health problems.\"\n\nIn the OANN report, Roz claimed: \u201cNewly released videos appear to show Gugino using a police tracker on his phone trying to scan police communications during the protest. The tactic, known as skimming, is an old trick used by antifa to locate police officers and plan violence activities, bypassing the police response.\u201d\n\nThis is not new video, just the original video with the speed slowed down so much that waving a phone while talking to police is made to appear like a scanner. There is no evidence he is using the phone as a scanner. The slowed-down video, posted on YouTube on June 6, has already received more than 150,000 views.\n\nThe OANN report also includes a clip from this tweet, which shows video of Gugino in animated conversation with other people before the incident with police. It\u2019s unclear what they are arguing about but one person points to Gugino, turns to the camera and says, \u201cI think he\u2019s looking to get punched in the face.\u201d The provenance of this video is unclear. The original source for the Conservative Treehouse is an account with just seven followers, which took the video from a tweet that has since been deleted. But it\u2019s now been viewed more than 50,000 times.\n\nThe president has irresponsibly tweeted a ridiculous conspiracy theory. The slowed-down video does not show Gugino with a scanner; that\u2019s simply his phone. There is no evidence he is using it as a scanner. He was gesturing with his arm when he was stopped by police before he was brutally knocked over. No matter what Gugino hoped to accomplish by participating in protests, it does not excuse the behavior of the police, as captured on videotape.", "lang": "en"}
