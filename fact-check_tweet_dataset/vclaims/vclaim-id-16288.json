The figure of \u00a310 billion refers to the NHS England budget, not overall health spending\u2014a definition that\u2019s been used in the past. There will be spending reductions in areas like public health that the NHS assumed would be funded when it calculated the size of its request.\n\nOverall health spending this parliament is going up by \u00a34.5 billion after inflation, once you count those other areas, as Mr Corbyn says. The Health Committee of MPs agrees.\n\nIn addition, NHS leaders asked for (at minimum) \u00a38 billion extra over five years. The government\u2019s \u00a310 billion figure is calculated over six years, counting a year\u2019s worth of money that\u2019s already been spent in the previous parliament.\n\nThe government has claimed recently it understands the NHS\u2019s request did cover this extra year. Full Fact is investigating.\n\nThe NHS says it is facing a funding gap of \u00a330 billion by the end of this decade, as the population grows larger and as people live longer. It said in 2014 one option for dealing with this is for it to find \u00a322 billion in efficiency savings, with the government putting in \u00a38 billion.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. The NHS also said its ambitions for savings were only possible \u201cprovided we take action in prevention, invest in new care models, sustain social care services, and\u2026 see\u2026 wider system improvements\u201d.\n\nThe government\u2019s \u00a38 billion commitment refers specifically to the NHS England budget. Outside of this, spending on public health is expected to fall over this parliament, and spending on social care is expected to continue to fall short of what\u2019s needed, according to health policy experts.", "lang": "en"}
