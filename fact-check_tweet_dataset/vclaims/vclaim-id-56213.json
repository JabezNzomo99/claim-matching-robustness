The DESE has publicly debunked the claim.\n\nMissouri Gov. Mike Parson announced on April 9 that all public school districts and charter schools shall remain closed through the current school year in an effort to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. At press time, the state has reported 114 deaths and 4,388 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, according to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.\n\nA viral image falsely alleges in a post that the DESE sent out a letter to parents saying their children must repeat the current school year, despite the DESE debunking the letter.

We could not be more disappointed that someone chose to use their free time to create this document, illegally using our department logo, and make a joke about something as serious as our students\u2019 education.\u201d\n\nThere is no indication that the DESE or Missouri school districts intend to make students repeat the school year at this time. Many students have transitioned to online learning environments in response to schools stopping in-person classes, according to KSHB-TV.\n\nThe fake letter, signed by \u201cCandice B. Fureal,\u201d appears to be an April Fool\u2019s Day joke but many social media users took it as fact amid school closures across the country due to the coronavirus pandemic.", "lang": "en"}
