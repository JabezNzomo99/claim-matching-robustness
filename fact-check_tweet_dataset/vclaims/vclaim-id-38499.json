Let\u2019s check the authenticity of that claim.\n\n\n\nClaim: Video of Celebrations in Ayodhya on November 9, 2019, after the SC verdict. Fact: The Supreme Court\u2019s decision on the Ayodhya dispute came on 09 November 2019, but the same video was found on YouTube with the date of upload as June 21, 2018. So, the video is related to an event prior to the Ayodhya verdict. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe Supreme Court has given the verdict in the Ayodhya case on November 9, 2019. But when the screenshots of the video in the post were subjected to Yandex reverse image search technique, the same video was found to exist on YouTube from last year. Those search results suggest that the video shows some celebrations related to Chhatrapati Shivaji in Maharashtra in June 2018. Also, by looking at the flags in the video, one can see Chhatrapati Shivaji\u2019s face on them. \n\n\n\nTo conclude, an old video is being falsely shared as \u2018Celebrations in Ayodhya after the SC verdict\u2019. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
