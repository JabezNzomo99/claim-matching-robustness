The message, by someone claimed to be from English news channel NDTV, elaborates how a recommendation made by a London-based group was mistaken by Akhtar as a win. However, The Quint found that this is a fake message and that the Richard Dawkins award has indeed been conferred on Akhtar. He has been given the honour for critical thinking, holding religious dogma up to scrutiny, advancing human progress and humanist values.

THIS IS PATENTLY UNTRUE! We have an email from Richard Dawkins on 5th June offering the award and also from Robyn Blumner who heads the Centre for Inquiry USA.I feel sad 4 these pathetic trolls who do not care that they will stand exposed in seconds 4 such a preposterous claim ! https://t.co/Ro1ejCNSdk \u2014 Azmi Shabana (@AzmiShabana) June 9, 2020 The Quint then reached out to Azmi, who sent us the emails mentioned, which clearly show that Richard Dawkins had himself emailed Javed Akhtar on 5 June (much before the news broke on 7 June) informing him that he had been unanimously voted as the recipient of the 2020 award by the board of Center for Inquiry. We have also seen another email from Robyn Blumner, President and CEO, Center for Inquiry to Akhtar congratulating him on the win. This email is dated 6 June. Therefore, it is clear that the claims made by the message that the award was not won by Akhtar and that the group mentioned was pleading for the award to be given to him are completely baseless. Private correspondence between those directly involved since 5 June clearly show that the organisation had informed Akhtar about him having won the award, much before news broke on the media.

Javed Akhtar @Javedakhtarjadu is the 2020 Richard Dawkins Award winner and I could not be more pleased. The Center for Inquiry, on whose board I sit, has designated him this year's recipient for his courageous public stands on behalf of atheism, rationality, and freethought. \u2014 Richard Dawkins (@RichardDawkins) June 9, 2020 It is clear that the viral message is making completely fake claims using the fact that the news did not come first from those involved with the Center for Inquiry. However, the official announcements have now been made and there is absolutely no basis to claim that the decision to give the award to Akhtar was made after the news broke, as the viral message claims. The citation for the Richard Dawkins award says that the recipient is \u201ca distinguished individual from the worlds of science, scholarship, education, or entertainment, who publicly proclaims the values of secularism and rationalism, upholding scientific truth wherever it may lead.\u201d Previous winners include philosopher and cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett, Cosmos co-creator Ann Druyan, activist and feminist Ayaan Hirsi Ali, and actor and writer Stephen Fry. In 2019 the award was given to comedian and actor Ricky Gervais.", "lang": "en"}
