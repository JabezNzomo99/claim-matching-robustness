There was also a red circle with the word \u201cFIRE\u201d at the lower right side of the screen and a bunch of codes on the opposite side. The screen was shown in grayscale.\n\nThe video lasted for a minute and 41 seconds. The crosshair aimed at a number of what appeared to be moving vehicles lined up along a curved road and subsequently fired at them. The video\u2019s perspective showed a bird\u2019s eye view.\n\nAs of writing, Viral T.V\u2019s post had been viewed over 236,000 times on Facebook. It also had 5,148 shares, 2,446 reactions, and 403 comments.\n\nUsing a screenshot of the first frame of the video shared on Facebook, Rappler did a reverse image search and found that it came from a YouTube video uploaded in March 2015 by Argentina-based video game development company Byte Conveyor Studios. The video was titled \u201cAC-130 Gunship Simulator - Convoy engagement.\u201d\n\nThe video from Byte Conveyor Studios showed the exact same features in the video clips that have gone viral. The audio was also the same.\n\nThis is not the first time Rappler debunked a false post about the tensions between US and Iran. On January 17, Rappler published a fact check on another video of a night sky flare, which Facebook pages said was the \u201cstart of Iran vs U.S. World War 3.\u201d This was also proven false. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
