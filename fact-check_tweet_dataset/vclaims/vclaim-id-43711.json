All 15 crew member aboard the Ilyushin Il-20 maritime patrol aircraft were killed.\n\nInitially, the Russian Defense Ministry blamed Israel despite knowing the plane had been shot down by an S-200 surface-to-air missile operated by the Syrian Arab Army. A Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson claimed the Israeli F-16s were using the Russian military plane as \u201ccover\u201d to escape detection and ground fire during the raid. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu himself repeated this claim.\n\nHowever, President Vladimir Putin declined to point fingers when asked about the incident at a joint press conference with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.\n\n\u201cIn this case, it is more a chain of tragic circumstances because an Israeli fighter did not down our aircraft,\u201d Putin said.\n\n\u201cIt goes without saying that we must get to the bottom of this. Our attitude towards this tragedy is set forth in a statement by our Defense Ministry, and has been fully coordinated with me.\u201d\n\nThe Israeli Defense Forces\u2019 official Twitter account offered condolences to Russia for the lost crewmembers, but put the blame for the incident on the Assad regime forces which actually shot down the plane. The Israeli Twitter account said the Israeli warplanes were \u201cnot within the area of the operation\u201d and had returned to Israeli airspace when the Russian jet was downed.\n\nThe Russian independent news outlet Meduza interviewed Russian military air defense expert Mikhail Khodarenko on what might have caused the incident. He said the fault most likely lies with the air defense system\u2019s crew, which did not take the steps necessary to properly identify their target before launching a missile. He also suggested the possibility of a technical fault, such as a failure of the missile\u2019s guidance system, but in his opinion this was less likely than human error.\n\nWhile we are not able to independently verify the Israeli military claim, taken together with Putin\u2019s remarks and the Meduza interview, we find the Russian Defense Ministry\u2019s initial allegations are likely false.", "lang": "en"}
