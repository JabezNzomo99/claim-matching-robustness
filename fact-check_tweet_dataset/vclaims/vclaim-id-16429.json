That was set at \u00a318,600 a year before tax, and remains at this level today.\n\nThis threshold doesn't apply to EEA citizens who want to bring a non-EEA partner to the UK.\n\nIf applicants have children, the income required rises by \u00a33,800 for the first child and \u00a32,400 for each child after that. Their partner\u2019s income can sometimes count towards the threshold, if they are already working in the UK on another visa.\n\n\u00a318,600 was chosen following analysis from the Migration Advisory Committee\u2014which advises the government on immigration policy. The government asked it what the income threshold should be to ensure spouses and children brought to the UK wouldn\u2019t become \u201ca burden on the state\u201d financially. As experts at the Migration Observatory explain:\n\n\u201cThe \u00a318,600 threshold is the level at which a specific type of family \u2013 a single-earner household with no children paying \u00a3100 per week in rent \u2013 is no longer eligible for tax credits or housing benefit.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t know the exact number of people who haven\u2019t come to the UK because of the threshold.\n\n47% is an old estimate\u2014it refers to the estimated proportion of British nationals working as employees who earned below \u00a318,600 around the time the threshold was introduced, and was widely reported at the time.\n\nSince earnings have been increasing and the threshold has stayed the same, the proportion of workers earning less has fallen. It was estimated at 43% in 2014 and 41% in 2015, which are the most recent estimates we\u2019ve seen.\n\nThis is the percentage of British nationals only. The earnings threshold also applies to non-British nationals who are settled in the UK, or living here with refugee leave or humanitarian protection.\n\nA single, national number for this also doesn\u2019t tell the whole story, because incomes vary a great deal. The Migration Observatory has previously identified that women, ethnic minorities, younger people and people living outside of London and the South East are less likely to be eligible on income grounds.", "lang": "en"}
