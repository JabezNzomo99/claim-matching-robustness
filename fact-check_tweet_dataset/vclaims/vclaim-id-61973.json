There are some laws already on the books, however, that would likely apply.\n\nA policy initiative passed in 2015 titled No Jab No Pay requires children to meet immunization requirements established by the National Immunisation Program Schedule for families to qualify for the Family Tax Benefit and child care fee assistance. For this policy to apply to the coronavirus vaccine, the vaccine would have to be recommended as a part of the National Immunisation Program Schedule, which specifies which vaccinations children should receive at which age. Another connected piece of policy titled No Jab No Play, deals with immunizations and child care. The requirements differ between the Australian states and territories, with some requiring children to be immunized in order to attend child care services, while others, like the Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania, do not have the same requirement.\n\nImportantly, those states that do require immunization require it for children to attend child care only, not school itself. Children enrolling in schools in Australia are required to have an Immunisation History Statement, so that \u201cif there is a disease outbreak, unvaccinated children can be quickly identified and excluded from school until the risk of infection has passed,\u201d but no vaccines themselves are currently required. In instances where a breakout occurs, \u201cthe local public health officer may request the principal to exclude any children who are not fully immunised against that disease during the incubation period.\u201d\n\nA member of Australia\u2019s coronavirus response team, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr. Nick Coatsworth, said on August 19 that for those who don\u2019t receive the coronavirus vaccine the Australian government is \u201clooking at specific things like not being able to go into restaurants, not being able to travel internationally, not being able to catch public transport or more broadly having what in the olden days would have been a yellow fever vaccination certificate, these are clearly policy decisions that need, will be discussed.\u201d\n\nAustralian Health Minister Greg Hunt cautioned though that \u201cthere's no current mechanism to enforce that sort of thing at the moment.\u201d Hunt has similarly stated that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t rule out\u201d the possibility of requiring anyone entering the country, including returning citizens, to receive the coronavirus vaccine. When asked if the government could incentivize people to be vaccinated by adding a vaccination requirement to school attendance and welfare, Hunt responded: \u201cwe reserve the right, subject to medical advice, to take steps that might assist [in convincing Australians to be vaccinated].\u201d None of these plans have moved beyond the speculative planning phase.\n\nWhile the Instagram post correctly identifies possible avenues to incentivize vaccination the Australian government is exploring, such stipulations of not receiving the vaccine have not been implemented and, indeed, may never be.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
