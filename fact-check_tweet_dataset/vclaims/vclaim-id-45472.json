The party reportedly paid an admission of guilt fine of N$ 2000 at the Windhoek Central Police Station.\n\nAccording to a letter sent to Sade Gawanas of the Landless People\u2019s Movement (LPM), which had laid a criminal charge in April 2020 against the ruling party over its violation of the lockdown regulations, the fine was paid by Swapo Party executive director Austin Samupwa on 21 May 2020. The letter was sent by Nampol inspector-general Sebastian Ndeitunga.\n\nThe international reporting of this case erroneously stated that all the members of the party who were at the birthday gathering were individually fined for breaking lockdown rules.\n\nThe misleading reporting appears to emanate from an AFP report from late May 2020 which was widely picked up across Africa and even as far as the United Kingdom (UK), where it was published by The Telegraph.\n\nThis is what The Telegraph article\u2019s headline stated:\n\nThe second line in the article states:\n\nHere\u2019s how the full article (which is behind a paywall) reads:\n\n\u201cThe vice president, prime minister and ruling party\u2019s secretary-general were all attending\n\nBy Will Brown\n\n29 May 2020\n\u2022 2:05pm\n\nNamibia\u2019s president has admitted that he breached his country\u2019s coronavirus regulations when he hosted a party to mark his political party\u2019s 60th anniversary. \n\nHe has now fined all those who attended the illegal birthday bash. \n\nNamibia\u2019s ruling party, the South West Africa People\u2019s Organisation (SWAPO), held a celebration on April 19th, when the sparsely populated southern African nation was under lockdown and gatherings were banned.\n\nHage Geingob, the president, said that less than ten people attended but those included the vice-president, the prime minister and party\u2019s secretary-general. \n\nAll of the guests have been fined 2,000 Namibian dollars, the equivalent of about \u00a3110. \n\n\u201cWe had a very important occasion of the 60th anniversary of SWAPO,\u201d Mr Geingob said in a press conference yesterday. \u201cWe were found not on the right side of the regulations and law. We had to admit guilt and we were punished, we paid.\u201d\n\nFrom official data, Namibia seems to have been extraordinarily successful in its efforts to keep the coronavirus pandemic under control. \n\nThe Namibian government was quick to react when it recorded its first cases of coronavirus on the 13th of March. Soon after, it closed its borders to international travel. \n\nThe vast nation is roughly the same size as France and England combined has just 2.5m people. So far it has recorded 23 cases of coronavirus and no deaths. However, this is not the first time the president has attracted controversy. He invited several Africa presidents to his swearing-in ceremony in March, prompting them to breach their own travel bans. Botswana\u2019s president was forced to self-isolate for 14 days upon his return.\u201d\n\nA short video of the president admitting the party had transgressed can be viewed here.\n\nFor context, read the following Namibia Fact Check article in which we give a detailed assessment of what happened on 19 April 2020.", "lang": "en"}
