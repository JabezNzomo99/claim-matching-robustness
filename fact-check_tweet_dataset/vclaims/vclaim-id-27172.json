Readers were right to be skeptical.\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted before, ourlandofthefree.com publishes satirical stories. A disclaimer on the website reads: \u201cOurlandofthefree.com makes no guarantee that anything you find here will be based at all in reality. All posts should be considered satirical and all images Photoshopped to look like something they\u2019re not. It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the terms and conditions page on worldpoliticsnow.com, which reposted the story, says that \u201c[b]y operating the Website, World Politics Now does not represent or imply that it endorses the material there posted, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful or non-harmful.\u201d\n\nEven without the disclaimers, there are signs that the story is false.\n\nFor one, it says, \u201cPresident Trump was giving a speech in New Plantitngton, New Jersey today when he suddenly looked dazed\u201d and \u201cjust crumpled to the floor.\u201d But there is no such place as \u201cNew Plantitngton, New Jersey,\u201d and the image of Trump sprawled on the floor was taken by the Associated Press on April 1, 2007, during Wrestlemania 23.\n\nAlso, Trump held no public events on Sunday, July 30, when the story was originally published on ourlandofthefree.com. He visited one of his golf properties in Sterling, Virginia, that day and returned to the White House. Trump didn\u2019t travel to New Jersey for a 17-day working vacation until Aug. 4, which was after all three websites had published the same story.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nFoxtrot, David. \u201cPresident Trump Passes Out In The Middle Of A Speech, Rushed To The Hospital.\u201d Ourlandofthefree.com. 30 Jul 2017.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump Passes Out In The Middle Of A Speech, Rushed To The Hospital.\u201d Worldpoliticsnow.com. 2 Aug 2017\n\n\u201cPresident Trump Passes Out In The Middle Of A Speech, Rushed To The Hospital.\u201d 24usadailynews.com. 3 Aug 2017\n\nJackson, David. \u201cPresident Trump is going on vacation to Bedminster.
