The claim is false; the list was not published by Harvard. It was taken from a 2017 article published by a student newspaper about the \u201cmost difficult majors in America\u201d, ranked according to information submitted by students.\n\nThe photos were published here on Facebook on July 22, 2019.\n\nThey have been shared more than 3,000 times after being posted to a Facebook page with more than 280,000 followers.\n\nThe images purport to show a list of 55 academic degree courses ranked in order of difficulty. \u201cArchitecture\u201d is ranked in first place, and \u201cPublic Relations\u201d is in the 55th place.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption states: \u201c55 most difficult courses.

What position is your course?\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe same photos were shared on Twitter here and on Instagram here with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; a reverse image search on Google found the source of the list is not Harvard University, but this 2017 article by student newspaper The Tab.\n\nThe article\u2019s headline states: \u201cRanked: The most difficult majors in America\u201d.\n\nAn image published in the article shows the same list and includes a header text, which was cropped in the misleading posts.\n\nThe text states: \u201cWhich is the most difficult major in America?\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo from the 2017 article:\n\nThe Tab describes itself as a \"site covering youth culture and student culture\".\n\nIn the article, it states the list of the most difficult majors was compiled based on an analysis of \u201cself-reported results\u201d, such as GPA scores, time spent studying, all-nighters pulled and even hours napped.\n\nThe article states in part: \u201cBased on extensive data analysis, we have found Architecture is the most difficult major. On average those studying it work the most hours during the week, pull the most all nighters, have the highest GPA, nap the least and are stressed out more than any other degree.\n\n\u201cOur in-house data expert Matt Pencer explains our methodology: \u2018Through a weighted-analysis of thousands of self-reported results from surveys conducted by NSSE and The Tab, we have worked out which majors are the most difficult. The Tab used data on the number of hours students spend studying, all-nighters pulled, hours napped, GPA, and how often students said they feel stressed to compile a ranking of 55 majors.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile some social media users seemed to believe the list in the misleading posts, others were more sceptical and wondered why some majors were mentioned twice.\n\nBelow are screenshots of some comments on Facebook:", "lang": "en"}
