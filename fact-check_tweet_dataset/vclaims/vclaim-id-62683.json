Yadav later deleted her tweet which said, \"Chandni Chowk, Delhi. Will Delhi be the new Bombay? These videos that are coming out are pretty scary.\"\n\nBelow is the screenshot of the archive of her tweet.\n\nWe broke the video into key frames and found that the video was previously being shared on Twitter by several Pakistani Twitter users claiming it is a scene from Faisalabad.\n\nSeveral Facebook pages had also shared the video on May 18, claiming the several people crowded Anarkali Bazaar in Faisalabad, to shop for Eid festivities.\n\nWe analysed the video and found that at 13 seconds a board with urdu text was visible. A translation of the text showed us that the board says - Aini shoes.\n\nA search for Aini Shoes showed results for a store in Faisalabad. The store which has a website, listed their address as Anarkali Bazaar, Faisalabad.", "lang": "en"}
