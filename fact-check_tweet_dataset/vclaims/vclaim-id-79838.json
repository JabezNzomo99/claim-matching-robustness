Kamala Harris will defund Social Security.\n\nThere is no record of Biden saying he and Harris will defund Social Security. While Biden did advocate for freezing Social Security for one year and reducing the cost of living adjustment by one percent at certain points during his tenure as a senator, his presidential campaign calls for increasing the solvency of the program and some benefits.\n\nBiden announced Harris as his pick for vice president on Aug. 11, according to The New York Times. They made their first joint appearance as running mates in Delaware the following day. A viral post from that same day as their joint appearance claims Biden said in a speech that the duo will defund Social Security.\n\n\u201cI hope every American citizen heard Joe Biden say in his speech, that he and Kamala Harris will defund Social Security,\u201d reads the post.

Had he said that in a speech, media outlets would have covered it, yet none appear to have done so. A search of Biden\u2019s speeches in August turned up no instances of him saying he and Harris plan to defund Social Security.\n\nHis Aug. 12 speech with Harris, for example, did not call for defunding Social Security, but rather accused President Donald Trump of attempting to do so via his executive order temporarily suspending the payroll tax for those making $100,000 and less a year, according to CNN. Nor did Biden mention wanting to defund Social Security on Aug. 6, during the 37th annual conference of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials.\n\nBiden also doesn\u2019t appear to mention a plan to defund Social Security in July speeches, such as ones given July 9, July 14 and July 28.\n\nSearching Biden\u2019s campaign website turned up no results for plans to defund Social Security. In fact, the website states that his \u201cplan for older Americans\u201d will \u201cput Social Security on a path to long-run solvency.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe impending exhaustion of the Social Security Trust fund imperils American retirement as we know it,\u201d the plan reads, in part. \u201cWaiting to act only jeopardizes the program further, and will make an eventual solution that much more difficult. The Biden Plan will put the program on a path to long-term solvency by asking Americans with especially high wages to pay the same taxes on those earnings that middle-class families pay.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s plan proposes, among other things, a \u201chigher monthly check\u201d for those who have been receiving retirement benefits for at least 20 years and \u201craising the monthly payment by about 20%\u201d for widows and widowers.

In 1996, Biden also suggested raising the retirement age by a year and reducing cost of living adjustment by one percent.\n\nThe Biden campaign did not respond to requests for comment.", "lang": "en"}
