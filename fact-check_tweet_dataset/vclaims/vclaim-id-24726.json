No, that's not true: The only Democratic leader listed on a trending meme making the claim who was born near that date was Al Gore, who was born on March 28, 1948. Lead Stories has not fact checked if the former vice president and 2000 Democratic presidential nominee was bred by aliens from another planet, but the meme is ruled a hoax since the birthdays of the other eight Democrats are not in the stated timeframe.\n\nThe false claim has circulated via email and social media since at least 2006 and most recently in a post (archived here) published on April 13, 2019, under the title \"Well this answers a lot of questions!!!\" It opened:\n\nSome of you will recall that on July 8, 1947, a little over 60 years ago, witnesses claim that an unidentified flying object (UFO) with five aliens aboard crashed onto a sheep and mule ranch just outside Roswell, New Mexico. This is a well known incident that many say has long been covered up by the U.S. Air Force and other federal agencies and organizations. However, what you may NOT know is that in the month of April 1948, nine months after that historic day, the following people were born: See what happens when aliens breed with sheep and jackasses? I certainly hope this bit of information clears up a lot of things for you. It did for me. No wonder they support the bill to help illegal aliens!\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nLead Stories assumes this claim started as political humor, but too often unquestioning minds accept satire as true history. Here are the birthdays for each of the Democrats on the list as purportedly born on or about April 1948.\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton, former first lady, secretary of state and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, October, 26, 1947\n\nCharles Schumer, U.S. senate from New York, senate Democratic leader, November 23, 1950\n\nBarbara Boxer, former U.S. senator from California, November 11, 1940\n\nAccording to a Snopes review published in 2013, the same claim has been made about Republican leaders, none of whom were born in the stated timeframe.", "lang": "en"}
