Even though the four jihadis were arrested, where is the gang that screams mob lynching?)\u201d Mishra has now taken down his tweet.\n\nCo-convenor of BJP IT cell, Jamnagar district, Ranjitsinh Chudasama, had also shared the photograph.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nThe textual claim made via the tweets is true. A man named Vishnu Goswami was burned alive in Gonda, Uttar Pradesh reportedly over a verbal altercation. The youth was taken to a hospital in Lucknow for recovery. According to Dainik Jagran, Goswami was beating his father when four men intervened, which led to an argument. The altercation soon took a turn for the worst. The men poured petrol on Goswami and set him of fire. The police arrested the perpetrators namely, Imran, Tufail, Nizamuddin and Ramzan.\n\nAccording to a subsequent report in Amar Ujala, the perpetrators were drivers who transported oil tankers. Vishnu succumbed to his injuries on May 19.\n\nThe incident was also reported by Hindustan Times, according to which, \u201cThe victim\u2019s cousin, Raj Kumar Goswami, said the incident occurred when Vishnu and his brother Mahesh had gone to get back their drunken father, Ramgeer Goswami, who was loitering near the village, under Kotwali Dehat police limits, at around 8.30 pm on Tuesday. He said the four accused got into a verbal duel with the brothers while they were trying to take their father home. The accused confronted Vishnu and allegedly set him ablaze after pouring petrol on him when he was washing his face after the heated exchange.\u201d\n\nHowever, the video of the man burning alive does not correspond to the said incident. Gonda police tweeted about the misinformation on May 16. \u201cIt has come to our notice that people are using a misleading image to spread a rumour by giving the incident a communal colour to cause disruption. This is illegal and irresponsible,\u201d the police wrote.\n\nGonda police reiterated to Alt News in a phone conversation that the incident was not communally motivated. We also spoke with Vishnu\u2019s cousin Raj Kumar Goswami and his brother Mahesh, who had accompanied his brother when the incident took place. Both the men narrated the same story reported by Hindustan Times.\n\nYandex search results revealed that the video viral on social media has been around on the internet at least since 2013.\n\nSM Hoaxslayerfound that the video depicts a 2010 incident from Mehsana, Gujarat. According to an Indian Expressreport published on September 9, 2010, the deceased (Kalpesh) had set himself on fire at a police station, following which, two journalists were booked for abetting the suicide as they had made a video of the incident. \u201cTo douse the fire, we had no other option except our cameras. Due to unbearable mental stress exerted by the police, Kalpesh committed suicide in their presence. We have taken the footage to support this. The incident was also recorded by Kamlesh Rawal, Vinod Rawal and Chandresh Parmar,\u201d the journalists said in a plea.\n\nAn old video was, therefore, shared in the context of a recent event. Furthermore, the crime was claimed to be communally-motivated but the allegation has been denied both the police and the family members of the victim.\n\n[UPDATE: The 2010 Indian Express article that reported the incident depicted in the viral video has been added to the fact-check.]", "lang": "en"}
