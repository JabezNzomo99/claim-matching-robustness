(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe found no credible evidence that supports this claim. Pedophilia is characterized by an obsession of seeing children as sex objects, according to Nolo\u2019s Plain English Law Dictionary: \"A person who acts upon this obsession, by molesting a child, taking explicit photographs, and performing other acts specified by law, is guilty of a crime.\"\n\nIn Biden\u2019s more than 40 years of public life \u2014 including two prior runs for the Democratic presidential nomination and eight years as vice president \u2014 there have been no formal accusations, complaints, arrests or investigations that implicate him in any sort of sex crimes involving kids.\n\nBiden has been accused by some adult women of unwanted touching in public \u2014 and former Senate staffer Tara Reade accused him of sexual assault \u2014 but there have never been any credible accusations of Biden engaging in inappropriate conduct with children.\n\nOur searches of Google and the Nexis database, dating back to Biden\u2019s Senate days, turned up no arrests, news reports, or authoritative testimonies of inappropriate acts by Biden involving children.\n\nWhen we reached out to discuss the accusations, Biden\u2019s campaign pointed us to a May 2020 statement that was issued in response to an Instagram post by Donald Trump Jr. in which the president\u2019s son shared an image of Biden saying, \"See you later, alligator\" alongside a photo of an alligator saying, \"In a while, pedophile,\" to his 3 million followers.\n\nAndrew Bates, a spokesman for Biden, told the New York Times, \"No repulsive, manipulative tactic will change the subject from how almost 90,000 Americans have paid for Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus negligence with their lives and how the booming economy he inherited from the Obama-Biden Administration is now suffering from depression-level job losses.\" The COVID-19 death count in the U.S., as of this writing, is over 164,000.\n\nTrump Jr. later claimed he was \"just joking\" in a Twitter post, yet also repeated the insinuation by saying Biden should stop his \"unwanted touching\" and posted a collage of photographs of Biden with children at White House events.\n\nBiden briefly addressed Trump Jr.\u2019s actions shortly after, saying that what the president\u2019s son was \"trying to do is get something going on the internet\" by repeating the claim often enough that people believe it.\n\n\"It\u2019s sick,\" Biden said during a Yahoo News virtual town hall. \"But he is his father\u2019s son.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump has also been accused of sexual misconduct by several women. Dated photos of Trump with young girls, some of them doctored, have also spread on social media along with unproven allegations that he, too, is a pedophile.\n\nOn social media, the accusation is often accompanied by images, memes, GIFs and videos of Biden appearing to touch children inappropriately. The photos that are real often lack context. Others are not of him or have been deceptively edited to suggest something improper.\n\nWe found that these images are overwhelmingly captured at public events when he is posing for pictures or greeting people and many depict Biden showing affection toward his family.\n\nFor example, one photo, of Biden leaning down by a boy with his hand cupped on the child\u2019s face, shows him comforting his grandson at the funeral of Beau Biden, Biden\u2019s son who died of brain cancer. Another image from the funeral routinely used in posts shows Biden kissing the top of his granddaughter\u2019s head as she stands holding her mother\u2019s hand. Another shows Biden leaning in to kiss his grandson during his 2013 swearing-in ceremony as vice president.\n\nRELATED: No, this photo doesn't show Joe Biden engaging in disturbing behavior with a boy\n\nSome of the photos used in the posts were taken at various White House events over the years, and in multiple cases the parents have spoken out against claims that Biden behaved inappropriately around their children.\n\nOne often-used photo shows Biden touching a young girl\u2019s arm as he leans in to whisper something as she looks slightly uncomfortable.\n\nThe image shows Maggie Coons, the daughter of Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, during her father\u2019s swearing-in ceremony in January 2015.\n\nAfter the clip went viral, Sen. Coons, a Democrat, told Fox News host Chris Wallace that Biden was simply offering her reassurance and that his daughter didn\u2019t think he was creepy. Coons said that Biden, who held Coons\u2019 Senate seat before resigning to serve as vice president, has known his children their whole lives.\n\n\"I could hear him,\" Coons said in the interview. \"He was leaning forward and whispering some encouragement to her about how, when he was sworn in, his own daughter Ashley was 13 and she felt awkward and uncomfortable.\"\n\nCarly Melin, former member of the Minnesota House of Representatives, spoke out on Twitter when a 2014 photo she took with Biden and former U.S. Rep. Rick Nolan, D-Minn., became the subject of a Twitter thread by conservative columnist Richard Armande Mills. In the image, Melin and Biden are both holding Melin\u2019s son. Mills, a conservative columnist for Turning Point USA, wrote in the tweet that Biden is \"an open sexual predator.\"\n\n\"Sir, I don\u2019t know you,\" Melin responded. \"You have tweeted out multiple photos of my infant son in a disturbing, misconstrued attempt to advance your political viewpoint. Delete all tweets that include my son. I\u2019ve reported your behavior to Twitter. Thank you.\"\n\nSocial media users claim that Biden is a pedophile. There is zero evidence \u2014 no accusations, testimonies, arrests or investigations \u2014 that gives this claim any credibility.\n\nPhotos that supposedly support the claim are taken out of context or have been directly contradicted by the families involved.\n\nWe rate this Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
