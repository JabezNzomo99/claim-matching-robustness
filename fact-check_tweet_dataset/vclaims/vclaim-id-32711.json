Bernie Sanders at the 1969 Stonewall riots.\n\nThe photo doesn\u2019t appear to resemble any archival images of the Stonewall riots. A spokesman for the Sanders campaign confirmed the young man in the photo is not the Vermont senator.\n\nShortly after Sanders won the New Hampshire primary, a black-and-white photo of four women and a man standing up against a wall started circulating widely on Instagram and Twitter, with some users alleging the man wearing the black turtleneck is \u201cBernie Sanders at the stonewall (sic) riots.\u201d\n\nThe Stonewall uprising occurred following a June 28, 1969, police raid that targeted gay patrons at the Stonewall Inn in New York City. The riots are widely considered a catalyst for the modern LGBTQ rights movement.\n\nThe image, however, doesn\u2019t resemble any archival photos of the 1969 Stonewall uprising available online. Social media users have used a colorized version of the image to poke fun at hipsters and Tumblr users since at least December 2014, further adding to the post\u2019s dubiousness.\n\nMike Casca, a campaign spokesman for Sanders, told The Associated Press that the Vermont senator isn\u2019t pictured. (RELATED: Did Bernie Sanders Say The US Has \u2018Had Enough With White Men In Places Of Power\u2019?)\n\nSanders has publicly supported gay rights in the past. For instance, the Vermont Senator spoke against the controversial \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy, which permitted gay and lesbian Americans to serve in the military as long as they hid their sexualities, and the Defense of Marriage Act, which proposed defining marriage as between a man and a woman, according to The New York Times.", "lang": "en"}
