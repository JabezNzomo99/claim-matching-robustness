While both media outlets clearly stated that the video was old, they misidentified the speaker. (Click here to view an archived version of Times Now's story and here for Zee New's story)\n\nTimes Now's story claimed, \"The video shows Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan attending a Ram Katha programme led by Morari Bapu, the renowned exponent of the Ram Charit Manas. Bapu was in Abu Dhabi from September 17-25, 2016, for his 780th 'Ram Katha'.\"\n\nTimes Now later updated its story after being called out on Twitter but did not issue a correction. Zee News has killed the story all together.\n\nFake News and propaganda website Postcard News also repeated the mistake.\n\nThe video and stories was promptly lapped up on social media.\n\nIn the below video, the host introduces the person saying 'Jay Siya Ram' as the Sheikh Sultan and not the Abu Dhabi crown prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.\n\nSultan Sooud Al Qassemi is a UAE-based columnist and a prominent commentator on Arab affairs.\n\nBelow is a tweet from the crown prince's official Twitter handle.\n\nThe gaffe by Indian news outlets has not gone unnoticed by international media. Gulf News has published a scathing article hauling up Times Now and Zee News for the error.", "lang": "en"}
