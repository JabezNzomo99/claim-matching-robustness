Please don\u2019t believe any rumour.\n\nThe image shared in the tweet clarifies that such messages should not be believed and \u2018+140\u2019 calls are telemarketing calls. It further advises users to not share any OTP or bank details with any telemarketers.\n\nFurther, when we Googled the keywords \u2018140 number scam calls\u2019, we came across multiple reports about calls from the channel SonyLiv as part of a publicity gimmick.\n\nAs per a Hindustan Times article from July 11, 2020, as part of show promotion, many people got a call from a 140 or 40 number. The call was a pre-recorded message of a person who identified himself as `Rishi\u2019. In the recorded voice message, he is supposedly begging for help and stating that he has witnessed a murder and recorded the incident on a mobile phone. The killer was now trying to kill him, the message said.\n\nFollowing this activity, the Maharashtra police had issued its warning:\n\nThe account further clarified the misinformation around the video of the police personnel.\n\nHence, the claims that attending a call from a +140 number can lead to emptying of your bank account are misleading.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
