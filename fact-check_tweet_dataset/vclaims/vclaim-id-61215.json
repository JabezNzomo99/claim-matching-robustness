Scott Walker\u2019s latest TV ad seeks to link his leading rival for governor to \"billions\" in tax increases approved under Walker\u2019s predecessor, Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle.\n\nThe new TV spot, which uses a gambling motif complete with playing cards that depict Doyle as a joker and Burke as a queen, says:\n\n\"When Jim Doyle was governor and Mary Burke was commerce secretary, they gambled taxpayer money on dreadful policies, like billions in middle-class tax hikes on nursing home beds, gas, phones and garbage.\"\n\nThe ad then blames the duo for \"state budgets that created billions in deficits, and unemployment rates above the national average for the only time in 25 years.\"\n\n\"Wisconsin can\u2019t afford to be dealt another bad hand by Mary Burke,\" it concludes.\n\nThe unemployment rate claim is a familiar one. We gave the state Republican Party a Mostly True when it said \"The only time over the last 25 years when the state\u2019s unemployment rate exceeded the U.S. average was when Burke was commerce secretary.\"\n\nBut what about the tax-hike claim in the ad?\n\nWhen we asked Walker campaign spokeswoman Alleigh Marr\u00e9 for back up, she pointed in part to fiscal estimates for specific tax and fee increases in the proposed 2007-\u201909 state budget, as calculated by the nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau.\n\nThe bureau is considered the gold standard for budget scorekeeping.\n\nThe estimates show that when Burke was commerce secretary (Feb. 2005 - Nov. 2007), Doyle\u2019s proposed 2007-\u201909 budget sought a higher tax on nursing home beds and proposed a new tax on oil company revenues based on vehicle fuel sales.\n\nWhat about taxes on \"garbage\" and \"phones\"?\n\nThey are not listed as tax increases, but the same Fiscal Bureau report tallies fee increases. Doyle sought increases in \"tipping fees\" for disposing of recyclables and industrial waste. And he sought fees on telecommunications companies to help fund various library services.\n\nThe gas and nursing home taxes came to $305 million in Doyle\u2019s two-year budget proposal. The fees would have added another $61 million.\n\nThat\u2019s far short of the \"billions\" mentioned in the TV ad.\n\nThe gap grows when you look at the final version of that 2007 budget as signed by Doyle. The Legislature, which was under split control of Democrats and Republicans, changed the budget and the final budget included $19 million in increases for the items mentioned in the TV ad.\n\nIn the list she sent us, Marr\u00e9 added a big item not mentioned in the TV ad: a $414 million tax increase on hospital\u2019s revenue, to support state health programs.\n\nIt didn\u2019t make it into the adopted budget, but even if you count that proposal, the tally is $780 million, not \"billions.\"\n\nWhen asked about the ad\u2019s \"billions\" claim, Marr\u00e9 contended other Doyle budgets -- not just 2007-09 -- are fair game. The TV ad, she said, is meant to refer to tax increases at any point in Doyle\u2019s time (2003-2011) -- or increases during Burke\u2019s state time.\n\nBut the ad isn\u2019t clear on that.\n\nThe ad\u2019s language -- \"When Jim Doyle was governor and Mary Burke was commerce secretary\" -- refers to their time together. And Burke was around for development of just one budget.\n\nNevertheless, we took a look at the 2009-11 budget, which Marr\u00e9 argued should be included when evaluating the ad.\n\nBy our calculation, that second budget proposal contained $520 million to $1.35 billion in new taxes and fees on the four items cited in the ad. (It depends on whether you count $830 million in fees on telecommunications companies as a levy on \"phones\"; the bill barred companies from passing it directly along on consumers\u2019 bills).\n\nSo if you add the two budgets together, there were as much as $1.7 billion in new taxes on those four items.\n\nBut there\u2019s a major problem with tying Burke to that budget.\n\nShe left more than a year before it was proposed.\n\nMarr\u00e9 brought up one last point, a quote from Burke that is also in the TV ad, which says, \"Mary Burke came out saying, \u2018I support Gov. Doyle\u2019s positions entirely.\u2019\"\n\nBurke did say that, in an interview with the Wisconsin State Journal:\n\nBurke: No, and I can't say why or why not...I've always been an independent. I've always voted for who I thought was the best person for the position. I support Gov. Doyle's positions entirely. I'm very impressed, and I'm starting to feel very Democratic at this point because I feel he is just doing so much that's right for Wisconsin that creates a better place to live for everyone.\"\n\nThe comment is sweeping, so it\u2019s fair game.\n\nThat gives it limited value at best as evidence of how Burke felt about a Doyle budget proposed after she left state government.\n\nIn a campaign ad, Walker says that \"when Jim Doyle was governor and Mary Burke was commerce secretary,\" Wisconsin saw \"billions in middle-class tax hikes on nursing home beds, gas, phones and garbage.\"\n\nAs a cabinet secretary, Burke would have had some impact on one of Doyle\u2019s budgets. And it did contain increases on those four items.\n\nBut the ad misfires badly on the math and the blame game.\n\nProposed new taxes and fees in that one budget totalled $366 million on nursing homes, gas, garbage and phones, not \"billions.\" And the tally was far less in the final version of the budget Doyle signed.\n\nBeyond that, Burke was gone when Doyle\u2019s subsequent budget sought up to $1.35 billion more for those items in 2009.", "lang": "en"}
