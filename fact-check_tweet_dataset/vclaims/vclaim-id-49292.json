A self-described conservative, Miller appears to use Twitter trolling and promoting conspiracy theories as a tactic to attract attention to his congressional campaign.\n\nBefore we look at the origins of this bizarre theory, let\u2019s take a glance at Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s family tree.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 was born to Black parents, Tina and Mathew Knowles, in September 1981. Beyond that, her ancestry can be traced back to her great-great-great-grandmother, Rosalie Jean Louis, a slave who was born in Louisiana in 1800, and Joseph Lacey, a wealthy white merchant and Louis\u2019 reported slave owner.\n\nIn 2018, Beyonc\u00e9 revealed to Vogue that she was the descendant of a slave and a slave owner (emphasis ours):\n\nI come from a lineage of broken male-female relationships, abuse of power, and mistrust. Only when I saw that clearly was I able to resolve those conflicts in my own relationship. Connecting to the past and knowing our history makes us both bruised and beautiful. I researched my ancestry recently and learned that I come from a slave owner who fell in love with and married a slave. I had to process that revelation over time. I questioned what it meant and tried to put it into perspective. I now believe it\u2019s why God blessed me with my twins. Male and female energy was able to coexist and grow in my blood for the first time. I pray that I am able to break the generational curses in my family and that my children will have less complicated lives.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 has been in the public eye for more than two decades. So what\u2019s more believable? That philanthropist George Soros found an Italian singer, changed her name, brought her to America, found two Black people to pretend to be her parents, found her a spot in the musical group Destiny\u2019s Child, waited for her to become a successful solo artist, and then, after more than 20 years of deceitful patience, got her to insert subliminal messaging into her songs about a New World Order? Or, that Beyonc\u00e9 is a successful Black woman with a voice all her own?\n\nRegardless, the idea that Beyonc\u00e9 is actually an Italian woman named Ann Marie Lastrassi is not supported by any evidence.\n\nIn fact, this rumor was popularized by a tongue-in-cheek Twitter thread mocking a single comment in an Instagram post. In June 2020, the Instagram account Lawlessbey posted two photographs of Beyonc\u00e9 along with a compliment about how the singer still looked youthful. An Instagram user then commented on this post that Beyonc\u00e9 was actually an Italian woman:\n\nThis single comment (since deleted) appears to be the basis of this rumor. This comment was not accompanied by any evidence to support this claim, and this news has not been reported or corroborated by any credible source. In fact, we weren\u2019t able to find any sources (credible or otherwise) making this claim prior to JJwwebb\u2019s post.\n\nOn June 22, the @Barcarvs Twitter account popularized this theory in a joke thread mocking the conspiracy theory:\n\nIt should be noted that the hashtags at the bottom of Miller\u2019s tweet relate to the \u201cQAnon\u201d or \u201cQ\u201d movement, built on an unwieldy, nonsensical, ever-evolving collection of unfounded rumors that, more or less, claim that a \u201cdeep state\u201d cabal of Satan-worshiping, cannibalistic pedophiles is working to undermine U.S. President Donald Trump. This movement came to prominence in part thanks to the debunked \u201cPizzagate\u201d conspiracy theory and has spawned dozens of offshoot theories. For instance, some proponents of Q believe COVID-19 coronavirus disease is spreading via 5G towers (false). Although these conspiracy theories are outlandish at best, QAnon references have started to pop up in the feeds of some opportunistic politicians.\n\nOne of the apparent problems with QAnon is that it revolves around rumors of uncertain origin that often touch on barely believable topics. This makes it difficult (as seen above) to tell the difference between jokes that mock Q-like conspiracy theories and posts that actually attempt to further these ideas in earnest.", "lang": "en"}
