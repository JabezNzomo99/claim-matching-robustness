This claim is false. The person in the video is a different man, also named George Floyd.\n\nPosts sharing the miscaptioned video can be found here , here , and here .\n\nIn the video, the plaintiff, identified as Claudia Knight, is suing the defendant, identified as George Floyd IV, for damages to her car. Floyd admits he stole and crashed it while being chased by police in Chicago.\n\nIn some iterations of the video, such as this one here , the defendant is identified at the 26-second mark as \u201cGeorge Floyd IV.\u201d The full name of the man who died in custody of the Minneapolis police on May 25, 2020 was George Perry Floyd, Jr ( here ).\n\nGeorge Perry Floyd, Jr. was 46 years old when he died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020 ( here ). Born on October 14, 1973 ( here ), he would have been nearly 23 years old when Judge Judy premiered on television on September 16, 1996 ( www.imdb.com/title/tt0115227/ ). In the videos, the defendant identifies himself as being 16 years old.\n\nIt is likely that this clip is from an episode of Judge Judy that aired in 2010. Two Judge Judy blogs ( here and here ) include in their descriptions for Season 14, Episode 241: \u201cA teen carjacks a woman's vehicle and then wrecks it while fleeing from police.\u201d The blogs say that the episode aired on May 24, 2010, when the late George Floyd was 36 years old. The teenage plaintiff, George Floyd IV, would today be in his mid-to-late-20s, over a decade and a half younger than George Perry Floyd, Jr. was at the time of his death.\n\nPublished here by the Los Angeles Times and here by the New York Times, images taken of George Perry Floyd, Jr. as a high school student do not resemble the George Floyd featured in the Judge Judy clip.\n\nFalse. The teenager in the video, identified as George Floyd IV, is different person.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
