Whelan, who holds the citizenships of four nations, including the United States, said he was a \u201cvictim of a political kidnapping\u201d and the accusations against him were a \u201cpolitically-motivated sting.\u201d\n\nThe United States Embassy in Moscow has demanded that Russian authorities release Whelan from prison, saying the conditions of his detention are inhumane and that he has been deprived of adequate medical help amid deteriorating health and isolation from his family.\n\nDuring the course of Whelan\u2019s detention, Russian authorities have pushed several false narratives.\n\nFirst, Russia has insisted Whelan has no health issues requiring medical assistance. Moreover, in July, when the U.S. Embassy said Whelan\u2019s health was deteriorating and he requested an independent medical examination, the Russian Federal Penitentiary Agency (FSIN) denied such a request had been made or that Whelan had any health issues requiring medical tests.\n\nThat claim is false, Paul\u2019s brother David Whelan and lawyer Vladimir Zherebenkov told Polygraph.info via phone.\n\n\u201cPaul has a number of medical issues, but the primary one is a hernia that is becoming more serious. He was scheduled to have surgery in January this year when he returned from Russia, but obviously he has never returned from Russia,\u201d David Whelan said.\n\nAccording to Zherebenkov, doctors at Moscow\u2019s Hospital #20 examined Whelan on September 6, confirming that he was suffering from a hernia and that he needed surgery.\n\n\u201cWe have been sending requests for a medical examination to the Ministry of Health and others, so he was examined last Friday,\u201d Zherebenkov told Polygraph.info. \u201cThe doctors did not say the hernia was in an acute stage yet offered surgery, but Paul refused; he doesn\u2019t trust the Russian doctors.\u201d\n\nZherebenkov said Paul has chosen to manage the pain with medicine provided by the prison administration.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s given No-Spa [a brand of antispasmodic drug also known as Doverin] every day for pain,\u201d Zherebenkov said.\n\nOn September 2, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow posted on Twitter in Russian: \u201cPaul Whelan's parents are celebrating their 59th wedding anniversary today. Paul Whelan hasn't heard their voices in over 8 months. Maybe the Russian government will let Paul call his parents and congratulate them personally? Stop the isolation #PaulWhelan @MID_RF\n\nThat tweet was not the first time the U.S. Embassy has claimed Whelan is isolated in prison. The U.S. has repeatedly demanded that the Russian government end Whelan\u2019s isolation. Russia has responded by denying it has isolated Whelan, claiming he has been afforded all contacts and communications in accordance with Russian law.\n\nRussian law allows detainees at least one phone call a month with their families.. Vladimir Zherebenkov told Polygraph.info that Whelan, despite his repeated requests, has not been granted a single phone call during the course of his detention.\n\n\u201cBecause there are no translators at Lefortovo it is impossible to control what Paul will be talking about with his relatives, so due to such technical reasons there has not been a single phone call and there is no such possibility in the future,\u201d Zherebenkov said.\n\nDavid Whelan confirmed to Polygraph.info that Paul requested but was denied the right to make phone calls.\n\n\u201cPaul sought phone call access but that was denied by FSB investigator Aleksei Khishnyak,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that it would be safe for us to visit Russia while he is in prison and we have no other way to communicate with him.\u201d David Whelan added that mail correspondence with his brother travels via special channels and takes a long time.\n\n\u201cThere is a complication with Paul\u2019s mail correspondence with the family due to censorship and translation,\u201d Zherebenkov said. \u201cThere are no translators at Lefortovo, so the warden receives the letters, he then sends them to the FSB investigator, and the investigator sends them to the translator, then the entire process repeats in reverse order. This takes up to two months.\u201d\n\nIsolation and limited access to medical assistance are part of a Russian government pressure tactic to extract a confession from his brother on \u201ccompletely bogus charges,\u201d David Whelan said.\n\nIn covering his brother\u2019s case, Russian media do not \u201cseem to bother with the facts,\u201d David Whelan said, instead feeding the public mainly disinformation and reporting what the government tells them.", "lang": "en"}
