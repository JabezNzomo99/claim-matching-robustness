The meme read as follows:\n\nHis primary rules were: never allow the public to cool off; never admit a fault or wrong; never concede that there may be some good in your enemy; never leave room for alternatives; never accept blame; concentrate on one enemy at a time and blame him for everything that goes wrong; people will believe a big lie sooner than a little one; and if you repeat it frequently enough people will sooner or later believe it.\n\nWhom else these words might apply to is a subjective issue, but we can verify that they were taken from a genuine psychological profile of Hitler.\n\nDuring World War II, William J. \u201cWild Bill\u201d Donovan, the head of the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (OSS), commissioned a psychoanalytic report of Hitler that was prepared by psychoanalyst Walter C. Langer in collaboration with other psychologists and submitted to the OSS in late 1943 or early 1944.\n\nTitled \u201cA Psychological Analysis of Adolph Hitler: His Life and Legend,\u201d the 165-page document, which was initially classified \u201cSecret,\u201d was declassified in 1968 and published in book form in 1972. The passage quoted above appears on page 38 in Part III (\u201cHitler \u2014 As His Associates Know Him\u201d) of the report:", "lang": "en"}
