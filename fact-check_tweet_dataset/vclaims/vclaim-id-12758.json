The fake message claims the children were abducted from different countries and trafficked to India.\n\nThe same message has also been dubbed in Malayalam now. (BOOM has decided not to embed the audio clips in its story as a precaution against it being misused)\n\nThe photo in the message is from October this year taken at Barwani district of Madhya Pradesh and features in an article dated October 10, 2018 by Hindi newspaper Patrika.

While four boys were born to first wife Sungi Bai, the youngest of the five was born to Singh\u2019s second wife Sunita. Singh along with his first wife were said to be missing since the incident came to light, media reports said.\n\nLocal police were not immediately available for comment. BOOM will update the story upon receiving a comment.\n\nA video from Eenadu India also proves that the photo is unconnected to supposed child kidnappers in Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe second photo showing rows of bodies of little children is from a chemical gas attack in Ghouta, Syria in August 2013 and was debunked by BOOM in 2017. (Click here to read the story) Deadly nerve agent \u2018sarin\u2019 was used in an attack on the Ghouta agricultural belt around Damascus on the morning of August 21st 2013.\n\nThe disturbing photo went viral in late 2016 and early 2017 to spread a hoax about organ harvesting in Thailand and Malaysia. American fact checking website Snopes debunked the rumour in Dec 2016. (See Snopes\u2019 story here)\n\nRumours of child abductors particularly on WhatsApp have had brutal real world consequences in India where at least 25 people were lynched by mobs in separate incidents, this year alone. Over 30 people have been killed over child kidnapping rumours since 2017, data shows. In all cases, the victims were attacked on mere suspicion with police finding no evidence of the victims being child kidnappers.\n\nBOOM was the first news organisation to debunk child kidnapping images and videos in India including infamous the cropped Pakistani ad that was shared as CCTV footage of an actual abduction, in May 2017.
