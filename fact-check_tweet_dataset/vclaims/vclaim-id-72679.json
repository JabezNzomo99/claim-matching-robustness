A third featured a doctored photo of Russell in a \"Trump 2016\" shirt.\n\nNow, a Facebook post from Jan. 23 reports that he\u2019s supposedly speaking out again.\n\n\"If the Dems regain power, they have promised to abolish the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th & 6th amendments,\" reads the text of a quote next to a picture of Russell\u2019s face. \"Also the Senate, the Electoral College, the Supreme Court, borders, ICE, and more.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe quote has appeared elsewhere, including on this meme website that appears to show Kurt Russell tweeting the claim about Democrats. But the handle associated with the apparent account\u2014@kurtru\u2014doesn\u2019t exist. While the actor\u2019s longtime partner, Goldie Hawn, has a verified Twitter account, Russell seems to be absent from the platform.\n\nAlso absent: Any credible sources supporting the claim that Russell suggested that the Democrats, who took control of the U.S. House after the midterms, are enemies of the state.\n\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
