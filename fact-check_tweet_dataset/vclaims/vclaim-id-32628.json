The United States of America should have a foundation free from the influence of clergy.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Washington authored the statement. The first sentence comes from a version of the Treaty of Tripoli; the second may actually be a variation of a line from a biography of Albert Gallatin, the treasury secretary from 1801 to 1814.\n\nWashington, a founding father and the nation\u2019s first president, is frequently ascribed sayings on governance and religion.

It appears nowhere in the Papers of George Washington or his recorded speeches.\n\nA quick internet search revealed that the first line actually comes from the English-language version of the Treaty of Tripoli. The treaty, which was ratified in 1797, sought to protect American ships from Barbary pirates.\n\nKatie Blizzard of the Washington Papers at the University of Virginia confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller that the second sentence of the alleged quote does not appear in Washington\u2019s writings but was unable to provide \u201cany definite information\u201d on its origin.\n\n\u201cThere does not appear to be any basis for Washington authoring the quote after which you are inquiring,\u201d Blizzard told the Caller in an email. \u201cThough Washington respected religious diversity, he also believed religion to be important to the preservation of democracy.\u201d\n\nThe second sentence is often attributed to Gallatin, a former treasury secretary, yet it does not appear in the \u201cWritings of Albert Gallatin,\u201d according to Blizzard. It may actually be a variation of a line from John Austin Stevens\u2019 1883 biography of Gallatin that readers then mistakenly ascribed to Gallatin.\n\nIn the biography, Stevens offered an interpretation of what he perceived to be Gallatin\u2019s beliefs, writing, \u201cPrivate zeal could alone be relied upon to establish the new enterprise on a foundation free from the influence of clergy; an indispensable condition of success. These were the views of Mr. Jefferson in 1807. These were the views of Mr. Gallatin.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
