Cooper\u2019s now-deleted tweet featured a video of Trump at a rally pretending to gasp for breath and crying \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nTrump has not held a rally since early March, when he canceled public gatherings for his campaign due to concerns about coronavirus. The video in question comes, in fact, from a February 20 rally held in Colorado Springs. During the rally, Trump mocked former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg for his performance at a recent Democratic debate, saying that Bloomberg \u201cchoked.\u201d Trump then pretended to be Bloomberg \u201cchoking\u201d on-stage.\n\nThe video of Trump saying \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d was filmed well before the current protests and was mocking Bloomberg, not, as Cooper claimed, Floyd or any protesters.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
