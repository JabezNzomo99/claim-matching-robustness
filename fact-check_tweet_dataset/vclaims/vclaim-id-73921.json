The system being used is different this year after the Covid-19 pandemic led to all exams being cancelled. The evening before, 12 August, The Daily Telegraph tweeted a picture of its front page for the next day, which included a news story containing quotes from Mr Williamson\u2019s article.\n\nThe story was headlined \u201cBoosting exam grades \u2018would harm Generation Covid for life\u2019\u201d. In the quotes, Mr Williamson said that giving results based only on the predicted grades of teachers would mean results were considerably higher this year, which he said would \u201cdevalue the results for the class of 2020\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cBut worse than that, it would mean that students this year would lose out twice over, both in their education and their future prospects.\u201d\n\nIf the results are devalued, this would suggest that universities or employers might not take high results seriously, rather than pupils being overpromoted.\n\nDaisy Christodoulou, an education specialist, noted on Twitter that shortly after The Daily Telegraph front page was tweeted on 12 August, it was retweeted by financial journalist Philip Coggan with the caption: \u201cThe danger is that pupils will be overpromoted into jobs that are beyond their competence, says Gavin Williamson.\u201d\n\nThis caption was not written as a direct quote. The next day, Mr Coggan tweeted: \u201cJust to emphasise, as I think most people realised, this was a joke based on the tone of Williamson's remarks.\u201d However, by this point the \u2018joke\u2019 had been widely shared as a fact.\n\nPublic figures attributed this quote to Mr Williamson, including journalists Piers Morgan, John Crace and Adam Boulton, comedian and actor David Schneider, Labour MP Toby Perkins and Labour peer Lord Andrew Adonis. It was also reported or featured in The Guardian, Huff Post, Indy100 and The Poke.\n\nOn Twitter, the Department for Education warned about the \u201cfalse statement\u201d, writing: \u201cA false statement attributed to the Secretary of State has been widely circulated today regarding the standardisation of A-level grades and students\u2019 future career prospects.\n\n\u201cThe Secretary of State said if grades weren\u2019t standardised it \u201cwould devalue the results for the class of 2020. But worse than that, it would mean that students this year would lose out twice over, both in their education and their future prospects\u201d.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
