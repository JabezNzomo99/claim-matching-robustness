The channel\u2019s political editor and anchor went on to suggest the shooter was encouraged by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress\u2019 Rahul Gandhi adding that this is the \u2018real face of anti-CAA protests\u2019.\n\n\u201cRahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal should answer how they are supporting. Under which condition are they supporting these kind of people because under CAA this is happening,\u201d the political editor went on to say.\n\nBut the narrative that the channel built around this episode, which (for them) started with blaming the anti-CAA protesters, was not just wrong but also provocative.", "lang": "en"}
