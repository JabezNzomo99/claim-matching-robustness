It was alleged that the Congress rally where Pakistani flag was raised was held in Tumkur, Karnataka.\n\nThe video was shared on Facebook mostly by individual users in both English and Kannada captions.\n\nNot the flag of Pakistan\n\nThis claim was shared earlier in 2018, ahead of the Karnataka assembly election. It has already been debunked by Alt News. The green-coloured flag seen in the video is not the Pakistani flag. It is in fact the banner of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), a political party based in Kerala.\n\nThere are clear and visible differences between the IUML banner and the Pakistani national flag. The two have been juxtaposed below for comparison.\n\nThe \u2018Pakistan flag\u2019 bogey is raised every time elections are on the anvil. Earlier in May 2018, ahead of the Karnataka assembly election, the same video had been circulated with the same narrative. It was also falsely claimed that the Pakistani flag was waved at a victory rally of the Congress party in Rajasthan.", "lang": "en"}
