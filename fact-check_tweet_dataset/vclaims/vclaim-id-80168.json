While the document is real, it does not offer definitive evidence that she requested air strikes.\n\nThe reports, including on Pinoy Hub, state the declassified CIA cable from December 4, 1989, contains proof that Aquino asked for the US air strikes to quell the rebels.\n\nThe headline in the Pinoy Hub article, written in Filipino, states: \u201cCIA reveals documents proving that Cory Aquino requested air strikes against Filipino soldiers in 1989!\u201d\n\nIdentical, or very similar headlines, have been carried in multiple reports and they have been widely shared on Facebook such as here at HiddenTruthPH.\n\nAquino led the famous \"People Power\" revolution that overthrew dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 1986. She ruled for the next six years, although she had to survive a number of deadly coup attempts including the one in December 1989.\n\nMany Filipinos regard Aquino, who died in 2009, as a democracy heroine. Some of her critics have sought to use these reports to discredit her.\n\nThe cable cited in the reports is real. It was declassified in 2013. It can be viewed at the CIA 's website here. In it the CIA does state that Aquino asked for help in quelling the coup.\n\nHowever, the document\u2019s only reference to Aquino specifically asking for air strikes is sourced to reports from the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post.\n\nThe CIA does not confirm in the document whether the media reports are accurate.\n\nSo the so-called proof the reports claim has been \"revealed\" in the CIA document is an unconfirmed citation of the American media.\n\nThe mutineers ultimately stood down, although the uprising left nearly 100 people dead, according to the government\u2019s official record of the events.\n\nDuring the fighting pro-government forces and rebels used air strikes against each other, according to the official account that was released in 1990.\n\nThe official account also states that then-defense secretary Fidel Ramos asked then-US ambassdor Nicholas Platt for American air support, but described them as \"persuasion flights\".", "lang": "en"}
