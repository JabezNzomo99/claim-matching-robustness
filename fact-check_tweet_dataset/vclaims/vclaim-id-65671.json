This is false; the pandemic has shown that nobody is immune to COVID-19, and experts called the claim \"dangerous.\"\n\n\u201cGo ahead and take my picture, I don't need to wear no stupid mask. Covid doesn't affect anyone under 10% body fat BTW. The virus is only killing off obese people who never lifted weights or worked out a day in their lives,\u201d the July 22, 2020 post says.\n\n\u201cThis statement is 100 percent false. Nothing in medicine is that cut and dry,\u201d Hallie Prescott, assistant professor in the Division of Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine at the University of Michigan Health System, told AFP by email. \u201cRisk for severe disease varies across patients, most notable by age, but no one is immune to getting severe COVID.\u201d\n\nTaison Bell, critical care and infectious disease physician at the University of Virginia, said by phone: \u201cWe have never really envisioned that there is a body mass index number or percent body fat that makes you safe because, what we see is, the only requirement for you to get sick from COVID-19 is to be a human being. That\u2019s really it.\u201d\n\nChronic conditions such as diabetes, kidney or heart disease may lead to worse outcomes if a person contracts the virus, Bell added.\n\n\u201cBut I see plenty of patients who are not obese, with regular body weight, and some patients who are athletes, who have contracted COVID and were completely knocked down by it,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, \u201cEveryone is at risk for getting COVID-19 if they are exposed to the virus.\u201d\n\nOlder adults and people with certain underlying medical conditions -- including obesity -- are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19, the CDC added.\n\nIn May, Johns Hopkins Medicine shared the example of coronavirus survivor Ahmad Ayyad on its Patient Stories page.\n\nAyyad, whom the article describes as a \u201cchiseled 215 pounds\u201d who lifted weights and ran obstacle races before he got sick, was placed on a ventilator for 25 days after contracting the virus.\n\nHe was discharged from the hospital on April 22 with \u201ca blood clot in his left arm and damage to his heart and lungs -- all complications of COVID-19,\u201d according to the Johns Hopkins\u2019 website.\n\nPrescott said: \u201cImportantly, even people with milder symptoms and people who are not yet symptomatic can spread the disease to others.\u201d\n\nAnd Bell noted that \u201cit\u2019s dangerous to circulate claims\u201d like those in the post, \u201cbecause people may do something that\u2019s more risky,\u201d such as not wearing a mask in public or not social distancing, thus placing their lives and those of others at risk.\n\nThe post describes face masks as \u201cstupid,\u201d but health officials have emphasized the importance of wearing a mask in public places to curb the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nThe claim was shared on a Facebook page called \u201cBodybuilders Against Tipping,\u201d which has than 34,000 followers and claims that \u201ctipping should be abolished. Serving food and drinks does not warrant a tip.\u201d\n\nThe post links to an Instagram account of bodybuilder Said Sergeyevich based in Sydney, Australia, who has denied having any association with the Facebook page despite his personal photos being used regularly on the page, such as here or here.\n\nAFP contacted both the Facebook page and Sergeyevich\u2019s personal profile. No response was forthcoming.\n\nDeaths in the United States from COVID-19 on July 28 reached their highest level in two months.\n\nA complete list of AFP\u2019s more than 570 fact checks in English on false and misleading claims surrounding the novel coronavirus crisis can be found here.", "lang": "en"}
