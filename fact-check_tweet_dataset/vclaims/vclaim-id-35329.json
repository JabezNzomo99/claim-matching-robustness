But the story of the Mississippi River giant is the invention of an imaginative writer, who penned it as an April Fools\u2019 joke.\n\nThe article, shared on Facebook here and here by users who seem to believe its claim, features an image that appears to show a massive fish with \u201ca mouth as wide as a dumpster.\u201d\n\nThe article claims the catfish was hauled in with the help of the US Coast Guard and a crane, and had apparently eaten the town of Alton\u2019s tallest recorded person.\n\nBut RiverBender.com, the local news site that published the piece, said it was a joke dating to 2016 that resurfaces every year, an example of the long lifespan of an internet hoax.\n\nAlthough allegedly a Mekong giant catfish, which can grow to be about 700 pounds, the fish in the photo is actually a flathead catfish, which only reaches about 120 pounds, said Dr Jay Stauffer, an ichthyologist at Pennsylvania State University.\n\nMekong giant catfish are endangered and are native to southeast Asia.\n\nThe story makes the rounds every year, said Mike Hall, who has worked at RiverBender.com for 13 years. \u201cEvery April Fools\u2019 Day, we do a satire story. That particular one kind of blew up.\u201d\n\nAlthough some readers recognized that the article\u2019s claim was fake, comments on Facebook indicated that other users believed it was real.\n\nIllinois records indicate the largest reported catfish in the state was a 124-pound Blue Catfish caught in the Mississippi River in 2005.\u200b", "lang": "en"}
