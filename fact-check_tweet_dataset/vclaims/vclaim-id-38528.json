Ilhan Omar said, \u201cTrump is taking benefits away from black Americans by giving them jobs! You may think a low unemployment rate is good, but it\u2019s just part of Trump\u2019s evil racist plan to make sure blacks are no longer wards of the state. It\u2019s horribly racist to make them work.\u201d\n\nThe quote originated on a fake news website. There is no evidence that Omar ever made the statement, though she has been critical of some of President Donald Trump\u2019s policies in the past.\n\nOmar has become a popular target for fake quotes since her election to the House of Representatives in 2018. This meme, which has been widely shared on Facebook, alleges that the freshman congresswoman criticized Trump for \u201ctaking benefits away from black Americans by giving them jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may think a low unemployment rate is good, but it\u2019s just part of Trump\u2019s evil racist plan to make sure blacks are no longer wards of the state,\u201d the caption reads. \u201cIt\u2019s horribly racist to make them work.\u201d (RELATED: Did Ilhan Omar Say That \u2018All White Men Should Be Put In Chains\u2019?)\n\nHowever, there is no evidence of Omar saying the quote attributed to her in the Facebook post. The Daily Caller searched the web and her verified social media accounts and could not find any proof that Omar ever made the statement. It doesn\u2019t appear in ProPublica\u2019s archive of her deleted tweets either.\n\nThe quote seems to have originated with a fake news article on the website Genesius Times entitled \u201cOmar: \u2018Trump is taking benefits from blacks by giving them jobs.'\u201d The article, published in July, also includes a fabricated quote from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nThough the website has a clear disclaimer noting that it\u2019s a fake news website, the image shared on Facebook fails to issue a similar warning. It deceptively portrays the quote as real.\n\nThe website\u2019s tagline describes itself as the \u201cmost reliable source of fake news on the planet.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
