The claim is misleading; local and state police have said the message is a hoax; local authorities did issue some restrictions on social media communications ahead of the Ayodhya ruling, but their directive does not correspond with the \u201cnew rules\u201d outlined in the hoax advisory.\n\nOn November 9, 2019, India\u2019s Supreme Court issued a decision on a long-running ownership dispute over a religious site in Ayodhya, a north Indian city in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Here is an AFP report over the court\u2019s ruling.\n\nThe purported advisory was shared here on Facebook on the same day -- November 9, 2019 -- and claims to set out 12 new rules on communication which will come into force from November 10.\n\nThe text of the misleading post says:\n\n\u201cNew rules of Ayodhya decision on new communication will be applicable tomorrow: _ *\n\n 1. All calls will be recorded.\n\n 2. All call recordings will be saved\n\n 3. WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and all social media will be monitored: Tell anyone who doesn't know.\n\n 5. Your devices will be connected to the Ministry system.\n\n 6. Note that do not send the wrong message to anyone\n\n 7. Inform your children, brothers, relatives, friends, acquaintances, etc. that they should all take care of. Do not send any objectionable posts or videos ..\n\n 9. At this time it is a crime to write or send an abusive message on any political or religious issue\u2026. Doing so can lead to arrest without warrant.\n\n 10.Police will issue a notification\u2026 then cybercrime\u2026 then action will be taken.\n\n 11. This is very serious.\n\n All members of the group, organizers, ... think deeply about this topic\n\n 12. Do not send an incorrect message. Notify everyone and keep an eye on this topic.\n\n 13. Please Share It \u2026 Be careful of the group and beware of the group.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe same message has also been shared here and here on Twitter, and in Hindi here on Facebook.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Hindi text message:\n\n\u201cThe government or police have not issued any such directive; it\u2019s false,\u201d said Ashish Dwivedi, a spokesperson for the state police in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, when asked about the viral text message on November 13, 2019.\n\nThe Ayodhya Police also said here on Twitter on November 3, 2019, that the purported advisory was fake.\n\n\u201cThe Ayodhya Police completely refutes such messages that have been shared in several WhatsApp groups. Please don't share this misleading message. @dgpup @IpsAshish @adgzonelucknow @igrangeayodhya #UPPAgainstFakeNews,\u201d the Hindi language tweet says.\n\nOn October 31, the Ayodhya district administration did issue a directive including some temporary restrictions on social media postings.\n\nPhotographs of the Hindi language document were widely shared online by Indian media organisations and journalists, for example here by The Times of India reporter Rohan Dua and here by Indian fact-checking site BOOM.\n\nThe directive orders people \u201cnot to post or forward false, misleading or provoking messages and posters\u201d regarding the Ayodhya land case that could \u201cdisturb communal harmony\u201d.\n\nAccording to this tweet by Indian news agency ANI, which was retweeted by Ayodhya District Magistrate Anuj Kumar Jha, the prohibition, which was issued on October 31, will stay in force till December 28, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the detailed directive \u200bissued by the local administration on October 31 and uploaded here by BOOM, with two points - on social media restrictions - highlighted in red:\n\nThe Hindi language text says: \u201cNo person/ organisation/ group/ community/ political party is allowed to disrespect any deity or saint of any religion/sect or community directly or indirectly on any social media platforms, like WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, Hike, Telegram, Twitter etc or put any statue of god/saint without prior permission of a competent official.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo person/ organisation/ group/ community/ political party is allowed to post or forward any communal/ false/ misleading/ provocative message/ article/painting on any social media platforms, like WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, Hike, Telegram, Twitter etc. Also, no one is allowed to share, post or like social media posts/ message/ photo prone to spread rumours and disturb communal harmony.\u201d\n\nThe directive does not contain any provisions that allow local authorities to record all calls, save all telephone recordings, or connect all devices \u201cto the Ministry system\u201d as is claimed in the misleading purported advisory.\n\nThe state police chief also issued a similar appeal, calling on people not to post or forward misleading messages regarding the court\u2019s verdict, here on Twitter on November 9, 2019.\n\nAhead of the Ayodhya verdict, local authorities boosted security and deployed teams of people to monitor social media, according to this report by AFP.\n\nAt least 77 people have been arrested over social media comments deemed to threaten \u201ccommunal harmony\u201d after the court verdict, according to this AFP report.", "lang": "en"}
