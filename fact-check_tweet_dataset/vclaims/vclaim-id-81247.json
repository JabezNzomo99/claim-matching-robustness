Kay Hagan (D). In 2012, within the space of a week, it was revealed that two of his top aides, including his chief of staff, were having affairs with different married lobbyists.\n\nAt the time, Tillis announced that the aides had resigned and that he had authorized one month\u2019s severance for each aide \u2014 $12,500 for chief of staff Charles Thomas and $6,833.33 for policy adviser Amy Hobbs. (They also received thousands of dollars in unused vacation time.) By contrast, the N.C. Home Builders Association said it paid no severance to its lobbyist, Jessica Hayes, who had had an intimate relationship with Thomas.\n\nHere\u2019s how WRAL-TV put it: \u201cPayment for unused vacation time is standard for state employees who resign. But \u2018Payment in Lieu of Notice\u2019 is not. Legislative employees like Thomas are \u2018EPA\u2019 \u2013 exempt from the State Personnel Act \u2013 and can be fired at will with no notice.\u201d\n\nBut Tillis defended the payments as \u201cfair\u201d in the face of complaints that he should not use taxpayer funds for the severance. He argued that the aides had left their posts immediately and thus did not have a chance to give the standard two weeks\u2019 notice.\n\n\u201cI recognized that their jobs and careers were forever affected by their choices,\u201d Tillis said in a statement quoted in the Raleigh News & Observer, \u201cand that serious family obligations still existed for each of them. I stand by my decision to accept their resignation while recognizing the difficult transition period they are now entering.\u201d\n\n\u201cThom Tillis shared an apartment with his chief of staff when North Carolina news reported that the chief of staff was having an extramarital affair with a lobbyist. He was caught on camera and resigned. Then one week later, another Tillis staffer resigns for another sexual relationship with a lobbyist. Thom Tillis\u2019s reaction? He claimed he was surprised by his roommate\u2019s affair, but then rewarded both aides with taxpayer-paid bonuses. Thom Tillis: Spending our money to clean up his mess.\u201d\n\nThe only thing a bit dubious in this account is the language that Tillis \u201crewarded\u201d the aides with money. It makes it sounds like he rewarded them for having an affair or for having been caught. But otherwise, the ad captures the essence of a pretty juicy local scandal.\n\nTo some extent, this is a semantic dispute. The aides obviously resigned under pressure, and that point is made clear in the Senate Majority PAC ad. That\u2019s not enough to flatly label the Senate Majority PAC ad as \u201cfalse\u201d \u2014 especially since Tillis at the time repeatedly said the aides resigned. (He did not even say he asked for their resignations, simply that he \u201caccepted\u201d them.)\n\nBesides, the key point in the Senate Majority PAC ad is that Tillis gave the aides taxpayer-funded severance payments. The response ad is simply silent on that point, and instead veers into an attack on Reid for \u201cmeddling\u201d in a Republican primary.\n\nThe Tillis campaign uses the \u201cfalse\u201d label too quickly. The story may be sleazy, but the facts in the Democratic ad are fairly solid. The Tillis response ad earns Three Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
