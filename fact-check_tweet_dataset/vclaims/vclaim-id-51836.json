There is currently no evidence of COVID-19 transmission associated with fish or food products.\n\nAs the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases continues to rise worldwide, the internet has become replete with misinformation related to the new coronavirus that causes the disease. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims Coronavirus Cannot Spread In Areas With Warm Weather)\n\nThis particular post masquerades as an article from the Oklahoma City-based affiliate News 9, saying, \u201cAfter multiple individuals near Oklahoma waters tested positive for covid-19, healthcare officials began testing for an aquatic carrier. Upon further investigation it was found that rivers in Oklahoma are full of catfish carrying the virus.\u201d\n\nBut the real article, titled \u201cOklahoma Next Possible Hot Spot For Coronavirus Outbreak, Experts Say,\u201d does not mention catfish at any point. It actually discusses an uptick in coronavirus cases and deaths within Oklahoma and the measures that state and local officials have taken to curb the spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cACTUAL FAKE NEWS: If your friends share a fake graphic about COVID-19 and \u2018catfish\u2019 that looks like it\u2019s from News 9, tell \u2019em it\u2019s not from us,\u201d the local affiliate said on Facebook. \u201cIt is a fake, 100 percent.\u201d\n\nThere is currently no scientific evidence that catfish can carry the new coronavirus or transmit it to humans. The World Health Organization notes on its website that the virus primarily spreads from person-to-person through respiratory droplets.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration also state that there is no evidence of food or food packaging associated with transmission of COVID-19.\n\nAt press time, Oklahoma has reported 1,472 confirmed coronavirus cases in-state and 2 out-of-state, according to its Department of Health website.", "lang": "en"}
