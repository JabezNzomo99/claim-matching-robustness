But his phrasing, depending on how you hear it, could merit Pinocchios.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-08-30T07:00:42.029Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-86118", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/08/30/beto-orourkes-claims-blacks-police-shootings/", "vclaim": "A reader questioned a section of this quote \u2014 that unarmed black children are being killed at a \u201cfrightening level\u201d by police. At least, that\u2019s how it sounded to the reader. But O\u2019Rourke\u2019s phrasing could also mean that unarmed black children are being killed, \u201cincluding by members of law enforcement.\u201d In other words, he might have been speaking more broadly about violence against black Americans, and police shootings would be a subset of that.\n\nHere at The Fact Checker, we debated what was the most reasonable interpretation. The O\u2019Rourke campaign unfortunately did not respond to our queries, which did not clear up matters.\n\nIf you drill down and look at the data for unarmed black children killed by police, there is virtually no support for the idea that this happens at a frightening level. The Washington Post fatal-shootings database for 2015, 2016, 2017 and through Aug. 20 of this year shows no black children were fatally shot by police in that period. (A well-known case in 2014, involving 12-year-old Tamir Rice, would not qualify as \u201cunarmed\u201d under Washington Post criteria because Tamir had a toy gun.)\n\nEven unarmed black teenagers (18 and under) who were fatally shot represent a small set. The Post database lists only three killings of unarmed black teens, two of which took place in Texas: Jordan Edwards, 15, on April 29, 2017, and David Joseph, 17, on Feb. 8, 2016. The third fatal shooting, of 17-year-old Antwon Rose, took place in Pittsburgh on June 19, 2018.\n\nWhile O\u2019Rourke said police often shoot blacks without accountability \u2014 and the data backs him up \u2014 the white police officer who shot Edwards was found guilty of murder on Tuesday. Roy Oliver, who was fired after the incident, shot and killed Edwards when he was in a car with friends driving away from a house party.\n\nThe picture changes, however, if we zoom out and look at homicide deaths of blacks in general. In other words, are there frightening rates in which black men, teens and children are being killed in the United States, with some of those killings by police?\n\nHere, we will use unpublished data from The Washington Post\u2019s investigation of homicides in the 50 largest cities, which has shown that black men and women are more likely to be homicide victims and less likely to see their killers arrested than white victims. The data was provided by our colleagues Wesley Lowery and Steven Rich.\n\nThere\u2019s little question the black community faces extraordinary levels of violence. But whether O\u2019Rouke\u2019s statement qualifies as Pinocchio or Geppetto-worthy depends on how you hear it. There have been virtually no shootings of unarmed black children by police in the past five years. But hundreds of black children have been homicide victims.", "lang": "en"}
