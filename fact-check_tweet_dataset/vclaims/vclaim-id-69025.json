But we were interested in the second half of his claim: Have agricultural producers taken a disproportionate hit?\n\nThe Agriculture Department pointed out that 37 percent of U.S. exports facing retaliatory tariffs are agricultural exports. Those are the tariffs as of July 31, 2018 coming from China, the European Union, India, Turkey, Mexico and Canada.\n\nThat\u2019s disproportionate to the total goods the United State exports: about 10 percent are agricultural goods, according to the USDA\u2019s 2017 data.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to measure the exact numbers, though. That\u2019s because tariffs are listed individually by the governments that issue them (in this case, not the United States), and because the United States doesn\u2019t keep close tabs on exports. USDA calculated the 37 percent figure using official import customs data from the retaliating partner through a private third party, Global Trade Atlas.\n\n\"Export data is notoriously bad,\" Laura Baughman, president of the Trade Partnership, told us in July. \"It\u2019s inaccurate because people don\u2019t necessarily report it very carefully, since you are not assessing tariffs on exports.\"\n\nHowever, the agricultural industry is on average much more dependent on world markets than other industries, according to David Laborde, a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute.\n\nExports comprise 10 percent of total GDP in the United States, whereas they comprise about 20 percent of GDP in the American agricultural sector. That fraction is even higher for crops like cotton (76 percent is exported), soybeans (50 percent) and wheat (46 percent), according to USDA.\n\nAbout 16 to 17 percent of exports to China are agricultural goods, so any conflict with China (like the ongoing one) takes a heavy toll on agriculture, Laborde said. He calculated that 86.8 percent of agricultural exports to China are impacted by retaliatory tariffs while 36.9 percent of the non-agricultural exports are covered.\n\nFarmers face two additional aggravators: their products are easily replaceable and they\u2019re an easy political target.\n\nOne ton of U.S. soybeans is a nearly perfect substitute to one ton of Brazilian soybeans, Laborde pointed out. But high-tech medical equipment (another type of products exported to China) is difficult to substitute, so Chinese consumers are more willing to endure the tariff.\n\nAnd from a political economy point of view, Laborde said it made sense for China to maintain pressure on farmers in particular, as a core constituency for the Trump administration.\n\nPerdue said, \"America\u2019s hard-working agricultural producers \u2026 have taken a disproportionate hit when it comes to illegal retaliatory tariffs.\"\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to measure the impact of tariffs on the economy and particularly hard to measure the impact of retaliatory tariffs on exports. That said, the economy sets up agricultural producers to bear the brunt of tariffs. Exports are doubly important for the agricultural sector\u2019s GDP as for the country\u2019s GDP. USDA calculated that 37 percent of exports facing tariffs are agricultural goods, whereas agricultural goods comprise 10 percent of total exports.\n\nWe rate this statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
