{"title": "Dmitry Kiselyov\u2019s Lawyers Say He Never Backed Russian Military Intervention in Ukraine", "subtitle": "Lawyers for pro-Kremlin media figure Dmitry Kiselyov claim their client never expressed support for sending Russian troops into Ukraine, and that the European Council has denied him the right to legal defense. In fact, Kiselyov is notorious for provocative comments about Ukraine and the court followed regular procedures in adjudicating his case.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "June 21, 2017", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-20333", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-tv-propaganda-dmitry-kiselyov-eu-sanctions-ukraine/28571309.html", "vclaim": "In mid-June, Dmitry Kiselyov, director general of the Russian government-owned international media holding Rossia Segodnya, lost a suit he filed against the European Council at the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), the EU\u2019s chief judicial authority.\n\nIn the application he submitted to the CJEU in May 2015, Kiselyov demanded that the court annul sanctions the EU imposed on him for his role in Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine.\n\nThe court ruled in favor of the European Council, leaving the sanctions intact and ordering Kiselyov to pay court expenses.\n\nKiselyov\u2019s lawyers then claimed the EU denied their client his right to legal defense, implying that the CJEU approached their client\u2019s case on the basis of political considerations, not legal ones.\n\nThe proceedings and ruling in Dmitry Kiselyov\u2019s case were similar to those in any other case, the CJEU\u2019s press office in Luxembourg told Polygraph.info\n\n\u201cThe case was held before the General Court and the verdict speaks for itself; you just have to look at the judgment,\u201d said CJEU representative Stefaan Van der Jeught.\n\n\u201cIn this case the General Court, a panel of three judges, looked at all the facts, looked at all the arguments that were brought up, and made a decision,\u201d he said. \u201cIn general, if parties are not in agreement with the judgment, then they can appeal.\u201d\n\nIn comments to the Russian media, Kiselyov\u2019s lawyers claimed he never supported the deployment of Russian forces into Ukraine.\n\nRasa Jukneviciene, a member of Lithuania\u2019s parliament and the country\u2019s former defense minister, rejected that claim.\n\n\u201cIn this particular case, propaganda actively contributed to the destabilization of Ukraine,\u201d she told Polygraph.info. \u201cKiselyov provided active support to the Russian government in the annexation of Crimea and interventions in Eastern Ukraine. Therefore, he is equally as responsible as those who have executed orders to occupy a specific territory using conventional military means.\"\n\nOn March 2, 2014, some two weeks before Moscow annexed Crimea, Kiselyov declared on \u201cVesti Nedeli\u201d (News of the Week), his weekly show on Russian state television\u2019s Channel One: \u201cRussia is answering the plea for protection coming from the Russians in Ukraine and in Crimea. In complete accordance with the constitution, President Putin has been granted the right to use troops in Ukraine!\u201d\n\nOther observers say Kiselyov clearly backed Russia\u2019s annexation of the Ukrainian Black Sea peninsula.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely untrue that he didn't support Moscow on Ukraine,\u201d Paul Goble, a former U.S. presidential adviser on Russia and Eurasia, told Polygraph.info.\n\nAlexey Kovalev, a Russian investigative reporter and founder of the fact-checking website \u201cLapshesnimalochnaya,\u201d told Polygraph.info: \u201cIf you watch all his programs since February 2014, Kiselyov actually never said such a phrase as \u2018I support Russia\u2019s military presence in Ukraine\u2019, but all of this is craftiness, of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he was not supporting the presence (of Russian troops in Ukraine), nobody would allow him to host the highest-rated program on the biggest federal TV channel,\u201d Kovalev said. \u201cHe, of course, does it in a less straight-forward way compared with classic propaganda manipulations. But, for the last three years, \u2018Vesti Nedeli\u2019 has existed only for that \u2013 to inflame military hysteria in Russian society in regard to Ukraine and to Syria.\u201d\n\nDmitry Kiselyov is notorious for aggressive and often radical rhetoric aimed against the United States and European Union. According to multiple reports, he is \u201cPutin\u2019s favorite TV host\u201d and the \u201cchief spin doctor of Russian propaganda.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter the ruling of the EU\u2019s General Court, it is clear that propaganda is not covered by the freedom of speech,\u201d Lithuanian MP Rasa Jukneviciene told Polygraph.info.\n\n\u201cI encourage politicians to take one more step forward and eventually stop calling the Kremlin's propaganda tools 'media'. These propaganda channels are weapons for aggression against other states. These weapons, unlike conventional ones, are not for direct killing, but are aimed to affect peoples\u2019 thinking.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
