Is that really the case?", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2016-02-02T18:54:54Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-82802", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/07/28/has-obama-created-a-national-school-board/", "vclaim": "In speeches and in a 2012 Wall Street Journal article, Alexander says that in the early 1980s he promoted the idea of a \u201cgrand swap,\u201d in which the federal government would take over all responsibility for the state-federal Medicaid program and in exchange states would assume all responsibility for kindergarten through 12th grade public schools. That\u2019s certainly the case; he even wrote an opinion article on the plan for The Washington Post in 1982.\n\nIn any case, even if Reagan liked the idea, there\u2019s no evidence it made much of an impression. The late president doesn\u2019t mention any such Oval Office exchange in his dairies, though Alexander does show up at one point expressing interest in being U.S. ambassador to Japan. We couldn\u2019t find that the White House ever seriously considered pushing for a \u201cgrand swap\u201d of Medicaid for K-12 educations as policy, though the president did propose swapping Medicaid for welfare programs, along with block grants for vocational and adult education and other programs. As Alexander admits, the idea \u201cwent nowhere.\u201d\n\nSo, what is Alexander talking about? It\u2019s a combination of several things happening at once in federal education policy. First, there was an organic effort to create common standards for schools, what is known as Common Core. This was a state-led effort that began in 2009, but it has been embraced by the Obama administration with a grant-making program known as \u201cRace to The Top.\u201d States participate in Common Core on a voluntary basis, but so far as many as 46 states have adopted it, but a growing backlash has led some states to drop out.\n\nSecond, there was growing dismay in schools about the No Child Left Behind law passed during the George W. Bush administration, especially about a provision that required schools to show yearly progress in math and reading proficiency or face punitive measures. The goal for proficiency was set in 2014, and as Congress could not agree on how to fix the law, the Obama administration began issuing waivers to states \u2014 and even school districts \u2014 if they agreed to adopt the administration\u2019s education proposals.\n\nIn April, Alexander challenged Education Secretary Arne Duncan at a congressional hearing: \u201cPlease explain to me how using your waiver authority to place conditions on states about common standards, about performance targets, about teacher evaluation systems that are not otherwise required by federal law and in the case of standards, in my opinion, is prohibited by the law \u2014 how does that not amount to, in effect, a national school board?\u201d\n\n\u201cI used to be a superintendent, and I\u2019m not a national superintendent now. And what we\u2019ve tried to do is just very simple,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cWhere states want to move away from the onerous provisions of No Child Left Behind, where they want to partner with us and where we want to provide some flexibility, we just say some very simple things. You have to have high standards.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very important that we use language very precisely, encouraging high standards,\u201d Duncan added. \u201cAgain, common, not common. Our goal is high. We feel very good about that. We never have, never will touch curriculum. Curriculum is not standards. Those things get conflated either through \u2014 well, I won\u2019t get into why they get conflated. But standards are the bar we want people to reach, which is college- and career-ready once they graduate from high school. How you teach to those standards is curriculum, and it would be the height of arrogance to say anything about it. We never have, and we never will.\u201d\n\nSo what you have here is a definitional dispute. The administration says it is not acting like a national school board, whereas critics say it is \u201cin effect\u201d or \u201cde facto\u201d becoming one. We obviously take no position on that, but it is worth noting that the National School Boards Association, a federation of state associations of school boards, has endorsed legislation that seeks to rein in the Education Department\u2019s role as a policy-maker. Clearly the administration\u2019s moves have spawned some controversy.\n\nIn researching this issue, we discovered that our colleagues at PolitiFact in 2013 labeled as \u201cfalse\u201d a similar statement by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) about Obama \u201ceffectively\u201d creating a national school board. That fact check focused on the more narrow question of whether Common Core was turning the Education Department into a national school board -\u2013 not on the complex interaction with waivers that Alexander has highlighted. Still, that fact check should have indicated to the Alexander campaign that this claim was potential fact checker bait.", "lang": "en"}
