Were thousands of fraudulent votes recorded for him?\n\n\n\nA: Those claims were made by self-described \u201csatirical\u201d websites. The Alabama Secretary of State says there\u2019s no evidence that fraudulent voting affected the outcome. \n\n\n\nIs it true there was voter fraud in the Jones\\Moore campaign? I read that a small town of 1800 people had over 5000 votes for Jones.\n\nAlabama voters elected Democrat Doug Jones their next U.S. senator on Dec. 12. A week later, his Republican opponent, Roy Moore, still hasn\u2019t conceded the race.\n\nIn that time, a number of websites have posted made-up stories suggesting that rampant voter fraud contributed to Jones winning by an unofficial margin of 20,715 votes.\n\nBut, there is no evidence of wide-spread voter fraud. The Alabama Secretary of State\u2019s Office, which oversees statewide elections, doesn\u2019t usually comment on reports of voter fraud, but it has not received reports in any numbers that would change the outcome of the election, Communications Director John Bennett told us on Dec. 13. That interview was for an article we wrote about a fake story that said 60,000 votes in Birmingham, Alabama, may be invalid.\n\nSince then, the same network of self-described \u201csatirical\u201d websites that originally published that bogus story has fabricated several more advancing the idea that the outcome of that special election is questionable. A disclaimer on each of the affiliated websites states: \u201cEverything on this site is fiction.\u201d\n\nFacebook users flagged some of the stories after they were published by other websites without a satire label. Our readers have inquired about them, as well.\n\nClaim: Black residents from other states were bused in to vote for Jones.\n\nA story published on the Patriot Post website carried the headline: \u201cBREAKING: Busload Of Blacks From 3 States Drove To Alabama To Vote Illegally.\u201d That didn\u2019t happen. All of the details in the story were fabricated.\n\nFor example, the story quotes a fictional official from the \u201cState Election Integrity Board,\u201d which does not exist. Then it says that 27 black people were arrested at \u201cWarsaw Middle School in Selma,\u201d which is not a real school. It also identifies the Selma police chief as \u201cSantiago Swearinger,\u201d when his name is actually Spencer Collier.\n\nIn addition, the story also featured the photos of eight young African Americans who were not involved in the Alabama special election. The photos were taken in 2014 after those eight teens were arrested for allegedly throwing rocks and food from their school bus at passing vehicles in South Carolina.\n\nClaim: Thousands of fraudulent votes were recorded in one small Alabama town.\n\nThe headline on another fake story from Ladies of Liberty, a related website, reads: \u201c\u2018Thousands\u2019 Voted For Doug Jones In Alabama Town With Population Of 2,256.\u201d\n\nAccording to the story, the town of \u201cBordalama,\u201d which is described as being 20 miles outside of Birmingham, recorded 5,327 votes for Jones, even though it has only 2,256 residents. But there is no such municipality in the state of Alabama, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. A link on \u201cBordalama\u201d in the story takes readers to the website for the cartoon band \u201cHampton and the Hampsters.\u201d\n\nThe bogus story suggests that the votes of dead residents were counted for Jones, and the featured photo shows headstones decorated with \u201cI voted\u201d stickers. That picture, though, has been part of a popular internet meme, titled \u201cDemocratic Voter Registration,\u201d that has been in circulation since at least 2012.\n\nThe original photo of headstones \u2014 without the stickers\u2013 appeared online as early as 2007, when it was used to illustrate a Ukrainian website\u2019s story about the psychological effect the fear of death has on people.\n\nThis fake story, also posted by Ladies of Liberty, falsely claims that the \u201cBirmingham Press\u201d reported that \u201cpolling officials caught what appears to be a \u2018van full of illegals\u2019 who traveled to at least 7 polling locations with fake identification to vote for Moore\u2019s opponent Doug Jones.\u201d\n\nThat was not reported by the \u201cBirmingham Press,\u201d which is the name of a British website, not an Alabama news publication. A link to the alleged article leads to the same bogus story about unauthorized immigrants voting that was published on fellow \u201csatirical\u201d website, No Fake News Online.\n\nThe story says that the vehicle transporting the men was stopped by law enforcement at \u201cSanta Recto Middle School in Wilmington,\u201d as reported by the \u201cSanta Recto Observer.\u201d But neither the school nor the newspaper exist. And \u201cSan Salmos\u201d and \u201cPuerta Gorda\u201d \u2014 where some of the men were alleged to be from \u2014 are not countries.\n\nThere is only one person named in the story, \u201cMarcos Ramos.\u201d But that is also the name of a made-up character in another bogus Patriot Post story about illegal voting in Alabama. That story claimed the \u201c32-year-old Marcos Ramos\u201d worked at the Democratic National Committee, according to a non-existent Alabama publication, the \u201cMobile Press.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the Patriot Post\u2019s fake story contains a split-screen image of two men, but neither man is \u201cRamos.\u201d One photo shows a Mexican national who pleaded guilty in 2016 to smuggling methamphetamine into New Mexico. The other photo of an unidentified immigrant being deported to Mexico was used in a 2016 Arizona Republic story about illegal U.S. border crossings.\n\nUpdate, Dec. 28: Alabama Secretary of State John H. Merrill reiterated in a Dec. 28 interview that there\u2019s no evidence of widespread voter fraud that would change the election results. He told CNN that his office has received \u201cwell more than 100\u201d reports of voter fraud and has \u201cadjudicated more than 60 of those.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201cBREAKING: Busload Of Blacks From 3 States Drove To Alabama To Vote Illegally.\u201d Patriot Post. 13 Dec 2017.\n\n\u201cUPDATE: \u2018Thousands\u2019 Voted For Doug Jones In Alabama Town With Population Of 2,256.\u201d Ladies of Liberty. 13 Dec 2017.\n\n\u201cThe psychological effect of the fear of death on man.\u201d Podrobnosti.ua. 12 Nov 2007.\n\nGonzalez, Daniel. \u201cHow many Mexicans actually cross the border illegally?\u201d Arizona Republic. 9 Oct 2016.\n\n\u201cUPDATE: Van Full Of Illegals Caught Voting At Multiple Alabama Polling Locations.\u201d No Fake News Online. 13 Dec 2017.", "lang": "en"}
