Texas and Florida have successfully asked the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), the Department of Agriculture agency that oversees NAP, for temporary emergency waivers on this rule in light of the damage caused by hurricanes in those states.\n\nIn a press conference on Tuesday 3 October, Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 said that Puerto Rico had petitioned the federal government for a waiver on hot food and fast-food restaurants, and that he hoped to receive that waiver.\n\nThe relevant section of this video of Rossell\u00f3\u2019s press conference starts at 1.20.\n\nI have submitted a petition so that FNS [the Food and Nutrition Service] can \u2013 so we can request a waiver for FNS so that some of the food stamps and the moneys provided to the most vulnerable population could be used for purchasing in fast food establishments with pre-made foods. The reason being that this will give accessibility to the people of Puerto Rico to get prepared and hot food, and as we\u2019re seeing, a lot of these establishments are starting to develop effectiveness. So we\u2019ve made that petition, and expect a waiver so that the people of Puerto Rico that depend on this can actually get some hot food for them and for their families.\n\nHowever, we know that a request for a \u201chot food\u201d waiver made by Puerto Rico\u2019s Department of Family and Children on 28 September was agreed to by the Food and Nutrition Service on 30 September \u2013 three days before Rossell\u00f3\u2019s remarks. This is made clear in a letter included in The Hill\u2019s updated article.\n\nLater in the press conference, though, Rossell\u00f3 says a previous request for a hot food waiver was denied. The relevant exchange there starts at around the 34.45 mark. His comments were made in Spanish, but can be translated as follows:\n\nThis was reflected in a report about the press conference by the Puerto Rican news web site El Nuevo Dia, which wrote (translated from Spanish):\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether the governor was erroneously referring to the 28 September request as having been denied, or referring to an earlier request, while erroneously describing the 28 September request as still pending.\n\nWe were unable to contact the offices of either Puerto Rico\u2019s governor or Secretary of Family and Children, who made the 28 September request. In a statement, the U.S. Department of Agriculture told us they were not aware of any earlier request for a hot food waiver, but had given the Puerto Rican government \u201ctechnical assistance\u201d on that issue.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture provided us the following chronology of correspondence, requests and responses surrounding the suspension of food stamps rules in Puerto Rico:\n\u2022 September 12: FNS [Food and Nutrition Service] provided technical assistance to Department of the Family Puerto Rico regarding hot foods waiver but they opted not to submit a request (after Irma).\n\u2022 September 17: Letter to FNS from Department of the Family Puerto Rico asking the differences between NAP [Nutrition Assistance Program] and SNAP [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]\n\u2022 September 30: FNS responds to Sept 28 letter\u2026 [see below]\n\u2022 October 3: Letter to Secretary of Agriculture from Governor of Puerto Rico requesting reconsideration of allowing 50% \u2013 100% of NAP benefit withdrawal in cash to purchase hot foods. (Response Pending)\n\nWe were unable to contact the offices of either Governor Rossell\u00f3 or the Department of Family and Children, in order to ask whether they regard this timeline as complete and accurate. Phone service is still down for much of the island.\n\nThe 30 September letter \u2013 published by The Hill in its updated article \u2013 was written by Patricia Dombroski, Mid-Atlantic Region Administrator for the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service, and addressed to Glorimar Andujar-Matos, Secretary of Family and Children in Puerto Rico.\n\nAmong other provisions, it states that:\n\nHowever, the Food and Nutrition Service did not agree to every food stamps-related request made by Puerto Rico\u2019s Department of Family and Children.\n\nThe department had requested that the cash portion of each recipient\u2019s monthly NAP allotment should be increased from 20 percent to 50-100 percent \u2013 meaning recipients would have been able to withdraw half or even all their food stamps allocation as cash.\n\nThe FNS denied this request, and instead decided to postpone for two months a new rule which would have lowered the cash portion from 20 percent to 15 percent. The rule was originally due to kick in at the start of October.\n\nOn 3 October, Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 wrote to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to ask him to reconsider that denial, and the request is pending, as of 5 October 2017.", "lang": "en"}
