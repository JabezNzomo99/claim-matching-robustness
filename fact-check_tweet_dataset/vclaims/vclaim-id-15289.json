It seems in the video that the PM is calling himself the son of a Pathan while addressing a rally. Modi can be heard saying, \"Main Pathan ka bachcha hu, main sachcha bolta hu, sachcha karta hu (I am the son of a Pathan. I speak the truth and act accordingly).\"\n\nThe video is being shared widely on Facebook and Twitter. It has been shared in thousands at the time of writing this story.\n\nIndia Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is misleading. A part of the speech is being spread without context.\n\nWith the help of some keywords, we found that the viral video is from a rally Modi held in Rajasthan's Tonk district in February this year. In the rally, Modi was actually telling the crowd about his conversation with Pakistan PM Imran Khan.\n\nModi told the public that he wished Imran on phone when he was chosen the Prime Minister of Pakistan. During this conversation, Modi asked Imran to come together and fight poverty, illiteracy and impiety in both countries.\n\nIn reply, Imran told Modi that he is the son of a Pathan, he speaks the truth and acts accordingly. (\"Modi ji, main Pathan ka bachcha hu, main sachcha bolta hu, sachcha karta hu\").\n\nIt is clearly understood from the original video that Modi actually attributed the 'Pathan's son' statement to Imran. Someone mischievously tailored and shared only a portion of the speech.\n\nAlso Read | Fact Check: BBC never called BJP the most corrupt party in the world\n\nAlso Read | Fact Check: Viral photo claiming Sidhu being thrashed is misleading", "lang": "en"}
