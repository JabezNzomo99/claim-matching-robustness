The site includes a disclaimer at the bottom of each page that says: \u201cWorld News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content.\u201d\n\nThe made-up story, though, received more than 500,000 interactions on Facebook, including 47,000 shares, according to CrowdTangle data. It was also shared on YouTube and 4chan, an open, image-sharing forum, without the disclaimer. Some 4chan users commented that it was fake, but comments by others indicated that some thought it was real.\n\nThe bogus story states that \u201cElena Travis,\u201d who is described as a \u201c34-year-old Pro-Choice activist,\u201d officially broke the world record after receiving her 27th abortion. The photos that accompany the story are actually stock photos from Getty Images.\n\nAside from the misidentified photos and a disclaimer at the bottom of the story, there are other indications that the story is false. There is no byline on the story and the clinic mentioned as performing the \u201chistoric operation\u201d does not seem to exist. A Google search for \u201cSacramento Street Health Center\u201d yielded no results.\n\nWe\u2019ve written once before about World News Daily Report and have included the website in our \u201cMisinformation Directory,\u201d which lists websites that spread misinformation on the internet.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cA 34-year-old Pro-Choice activist has officially broken a world record after receiving her 27th abortion.\u201d World News Daily Report. 9 Oct 2018.\n\n\u201cCalifornia: Pro-Choice Activist Proudly Breaks World Record By Getting Her 27th Abortion.\u201d Earth Changes YouTube Channel. 12 Oct 2018.", "lang": "en"}
