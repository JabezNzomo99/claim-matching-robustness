In the video clips, Congress President Rahul Gandhi and AICC general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh Priyanka Gandhi were seen standing on a truck and waving at the crowd during their roadshow in Wayanad, Kerala. Mr. Gandhi filed his nomination from the Wayanad constituency on April 4.\n\nA massive crowd was seen waving different flags at the roadshow including the banner of the Indian National Congress. Pointing out the green-coloured flags seen in the video of the rally led by the Gandhi duo, @Padhalikha said, \u201cThere are more Islamic flags at Rahul Gandhi\u2019s rally than Indian flags.\u201d\n\nIn another tweet, which included a video of the same roadshow, @Padhalikasaid, \u201cJust look at the number of Pakistani/Islamic flags in his rally.\u201d The tweet also warned the people that if Rahul Gandhi comes to power, you will have \u201c500 Kashmirs in entire India\u201d.\n\nActress Koena Mitra also posted a photo a rally, where men can be seen holding green coloured flags saying that Rahul Gandhi was welcomed in Kerala with \u201cIslamic flags\u201d.\n\nThe video was earlier posted by INC\u2019s official Twitter handle on the same day.\n\nThe green-coloured flag seen in the video represents the flag of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) and NOT the Pakistani flag. The difference between the two flags is clearly visible in the images juxtaposed below.\n\nMoreover, the flags waved at the rally are also NOT the \u2018Islamic flag\u2019 as claimed. In the comparison below, the image on the left is a flag often used by Muslim religious organizations in India. However, the crescent star and the moon are placed on the top-left corner in IUML\u2019s flag whereas the same is placed in the middle in the generic religious banner that is often used in the subcontinent.\n\nIn Rahul Gandhi\u2019s rally, the flag, that be can be seen, has a crescent star and the moon at the top-left corner and thus can be concluded as IUML\u2019s flag and NOT Pakistani flag or the common Islamic banner.\n\nIUML is one of the six parties in the United Democratic Front alliance, which includes the Congress party. A report published by The Indian Express also stated, \u201cPeople were seen clicking photos on their mobile phones and waving flags of the Congress party and its ally Indian Union Muslim League (IUML).\u201d\n\nAlt News found that the image posted by Koena Mitra is old and dates back to January 2016. It pertains to former Kerala Minister PK Kunhalikutty\u2019s rally in Kozhikode, Kerala. He belongs to the Indian Union Muslim League and the men in the picture are IUML cadre holding IUML\u2019s flags and NOT Islamic flags.\n\nOne Facebook user Dhruv Kumar posted images of IUML supporters dressed in green attire with a misleading message, \u201c\u0935\u093e\u092f\u0928\u093e\u0921 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0930\u0948\u0932\u0940 \u0915\u093e\u0901\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u0915\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u092f\u093e #\u0939\u093e\u092b\u093f\u091c_\u0938\u0908\u0926 \u0915\u0940 \u0938\u092e\u091d \u0928\u0939\u0940 \u0906 \u0930\u0939\u093e (I am unable to understand, is it a Congress\u2019 rally or Hafiz Saeed\u2019s -translated)\u201d\n\n@squintneon, a Twitter handle quote-tweeted a tweet by the Indian National Congress, which comprised photographs from the same rally, saying, \u201cNotice the green Pakistani flag\u201d.\n\nMany other individuals on Facebook and Twitter have posted a video of Rahul Gandhi\u2019s rally in Wayanad, Kerala saying, \u201c\u092f\u0947 \u0926\u0943\u0936\u094d\u092f \u092a\u093e\u0915\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0915\u093f\u0938\u0940 \u091c\u0932\u0938\u0947 \u0915\u093e \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0915\u0947\u0930\u0932 \u092e\u0947\u0902 #Wayanad \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0930\u093e\u0939\u0941\u0932 \u0915\u0940 \u0930\u0948\u0932\u0940 \u0915\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0964 *pappu4pakisthan* Ab Toh Samajh jao (This is not a visual from some celebration in Pakistan. It\u2019s from Rahul Gandhi\u2019s rally in Wayanad, Kerala. At least understand now -translated)\u201d\n\nIn states where IUML has its presence, their supporters are often seen in Congress rallies holding IUML flag and these have been regularly misrepresented as Islamic or Pakistani flags. Earlier, IUML flags were falsely shared as Islamic flags waved by Congress supporters over reports of Rahul Gandhi contesting the election on the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat in Kerala.", "lang": "en"}
