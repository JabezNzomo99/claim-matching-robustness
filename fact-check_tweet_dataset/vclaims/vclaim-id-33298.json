{"title": "Russian Reporter Fibs About Ukrainian Delegation at the Council of Europe", "subtitle": "The main response by members of the Ukrainian delegation was to sing the national anthem and say the Ukrainian national slogan. No one wished death to Russia or the reporter.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "October 12, 2018", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-33298", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/russian-reporter-fibs-about-ukrainian-council-of-europe-fact-check/29538610.html", "vclaim": "On October 9, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) discussed restoring Russia\u2019s voting rights in the body, which were revoked in 2014 following Moscow\u2019s annexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine.\n\nUkraine\u2019s PACE delegation proposed an amendment to the rules covering sanctions on PACE delegations, with the intention of barring a vote to restore Russia\u2019s voting rights. Ultimately, voting on the issue was postponed.\n\nOlga Skabeyeva, co-host of the program 60 Minutes on the Russian state-owned TV channel Rossiya-1, attempted to interview the Ukrainian delegation outside the assembly hall. Rather than seriously answer her questions, the Ukrainian delegates responded with the Ukrainian slogan \u201cGlory to Ukraine!\u201d and then began singing the national anthem.\n\nThis was not how Skabeyeva reported the incident on her program, however. Instead, she portrayed the Ukrainians as bullied who threatened her, saying that they shouted \u201cDeath to Russia!\u201d and \u201cDeath to you!\u201d\n\nYet in her own video clip, it is clear the delegates are not saying that. One delegate, Boryslav Bereza, at one point did use the less-popular nationalist slogan \u201cGlory to the Nation! Death to the enemy!\u201d Later, Bereza clearly says \u201cShame on the Russian Federation!\u201d Bereza\u2019s slogans and mannerisms, which later included a \u201cmic drop\u201d with the reporter\u2019s microphone after she hands it to him. It looked as if he might have been deliberately mocking the Russian reporter.\n\nThe response to Skabeyeva is similar to the one her 60 Minutes co-host and husband Evgeny Popov received from Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko two weeks earlier at the United Nations General Assembly. Poroshenko categorically refused to give him an interview and accused Russian state media of spreading disinformation.\n\nSince the Maidan revolution of 2014, Russian state media have flooded the information space both inside and outside of Ukraine with negative propaganda, including completely fabricated stories. An analysis by the Ukrainian volunteer organization StopFake found that from March 2014 to June 2017, there were 919 fake or misleading narratives about Ukraine w published or broadcast. Most of these were produced by Russian state media outlets like Rossiya 24 (Rossiya 1\u2019s sister channel), RT, TV Zvezda and Channel 1.\n\nChannel 1 in particular produced one of the most infamous stories to come out of the war in eastern Ukraine, in which a woman claiming to be a refugee from the town of Slovyansk claimed to have watched Ukrainian soldiers crucify a young boy on a billboard before dragging her mother behind a tank until she was dead. StopFake later found that the same woman appeared in subsequent stories, with a completely different persona, leading some to refer to her as an \u201cactress.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
