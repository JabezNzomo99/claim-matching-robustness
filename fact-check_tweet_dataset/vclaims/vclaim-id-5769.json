This is false.\n\nVersions of the image with thousands of shares as of July 29 have been posted to Facebook ( here and here ). Posts include a screengrab purporting to show a Google search result for the question: \u201cIs a chihuahua a dog?\u201d Below the enquiry is a preview of a story ( here ) from The Watley Review website, dated May 25, 2004.\n\nThe story carries the headline: \u201cDNA Study Finds Chihuahuas Aren\u2019t Dogs\u201d. A passage from the article is quoted in the preview. It reads: \u201cIt was more of a surprise to find that some breeds are not even dogs. Among other findings, the analysis determined that the Chihuahua is actually a type of large rodent, selectively bred for centuries to resemble a canine.\u201d\n\nThe Watley Review is a satirical publication ( here ). It describes itself as producing articles \u201ccompletely without journalistic merit or factual basis\u201d. The satirical article does not appear to currently feature as a preview in a Google search of the phrase \u201cIs a chihuahua a dog?\u201d\n\nThere is no truth in the claim that chihuahuas are a type of rodent. The chihuahua is listed as a recognized breed of dog by the UK Kennel Club ( here ) which states: \u201cThe smallest breed in the world takes its name from the Mexican state where it became fashionable in the late 19th century\u201d.\n\nFalse. A viral claim that a chihuahua is a rodent, not a breed of dog, is based on a satirical news article.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
