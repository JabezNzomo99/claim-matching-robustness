To me, old age is always 15 years older than I am.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Bacon ever said or wrote this saying.\n\nBacon, an English philosopher who lived from 1561 to 1626, is widely credited with establishing and popularizing the scientific method. His best known works include the scientific treatise \u201cThe New Organon,\u201d the book \u201cThe Advancement of Learning,\u201d and the posthumously-published novel \u201cNew Atlantis.\u201d He also served as England\u2019s lord chancellor from 1618 to 1621.\n\nWhile Bacon wrote widely on a variety of subjects, there is no evidence that he authored the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. The saying does not appear in any of his written works.

However, the saying had already been in circulation for several decades at that point, with Quote Investigator locating the earliest instance of a version of the statement in Walter A. Clark\u2019s 1909 book \u201cA Lost Arcadia: Or, the Story of My Old Community.\u201d\n\nIn that book, Clark credited his father with saying, \u201cOld age is always ten years ahead of us.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
