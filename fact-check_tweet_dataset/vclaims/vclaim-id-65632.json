Over 423,000 were \u201cforcible evacuations,\u201d while around 28,000 were cases of threats, harassment and intimidation.\n\nIn a statement that same month, the Northern Mindanao Region chapter of Movement Against Tyranny recounted incidents of abuse allegedly perpetrated by state forces, saying the latter weaponized the imposition of martial law to \u201cjustify attacks against the Moro people and the progressive groups.\u201d\n\nThe Commission on Human Rights, following the Supreme Court decision on Feb. 19, 2019 to uphold the third extension of martial law in Mindanao, urged the government to \u201censure that alleged human rights violations are addressed.\u201d This included claims of \u201ctorture, profiling, and other infringement of rights caused by continuing internal displacement of communities arising even from its first instance of declaration.\u201d\n\nIn December 2019, Mindanao rights group Barug Katungod (Stand for Rights) welcomed the Duterte government\u2019s announcement that it will no longer extend martial law in the region, but called for an international probe on alleged abuses.\n\nThe group documented 162 cases of EJKs, 704 \u201cfabricated charges,\u201d 284 illegal arrests and detentions, 1,007 victims of aerial bombardments, and over 500,000 people who underwent forced evacuation throughout the two years and seven months of martial law in Mindanao.\n\nDuterte first proclaimed martial law in Mindanao effective for 60 days on May 23, 2017, following the Marawi siege by the ISIS-inspired Maute group. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Duterte revises Marawi story, contradicts martial law justification)\n\nUnder Sec. 18, Art. VII of the 1987 Constitution, the president may suspend the writ of habeas corpus or place the Philippines or any part of it under martial law only in case of invasion or rebellion and when public safety requires it. (See VERA FILES FACT SHEET: Explaining martial law)\n\nWhile the power to declare martial law is given solely to the chief executive, Congress may still vote to revoke the proclamation, which \u201cshall not be set aside\u201d by the president. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Panelo, Duterte\u2019s outlandish martial law justifications)\n\nEven after declaring the liberation of Marawi City on Oct. 17, 2017, Duterte, with the concurrence of Congress, extended martial law in the region three times until it lapsed in December 2019.\n\nEditor's note: This fact check was produced by a student from the University of the Philippines Diliman who is doing her internship with VERA Files.\n\n\n\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Philippines warned over \u201cmassive\u201d impact of military operations on Mindanao indigenous peoples, Dec. 27, 2017\n\nKarapatan Alliance Philippines, Karapatan: 2 years of Duterte's martial law marked by human rights violations, the continuing dire state of Marawi evacuees, plunder of Mindanao's resources, questionable dealings of security forces, and gross impunity, May 23, 2019\n\nMovement Against Tyranny - Northern Mindanao Region, Still No Peace, Just Piling Cases of Human Rights Violations, May 24, 2019\n\nCommission on Human Rights, Statement of CHR spokesperson, Atty.
