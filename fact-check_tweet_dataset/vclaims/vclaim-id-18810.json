You can watch the video below and access its archived version here.\n\nThe video has been shared widely from several Facebook profiles.\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search on one of the frames from the viral clip and found that the same video was published on YouTube in 2017 too. Meanwhile, with the help of some keywords, we traced the original video to June 2015. Watch the video below.\n\nThe original video is from June 2015 when Khan was not the prime minister of Pakistan. According to the report, Khan was addressing a press conference regarding the brutal killings of two brothers by Punjab (Pakistan) police personnel in Rawalpindi.\n\nImran Khan, then the president of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, had also taken to Twitter to protest against the incident.\n\nBOOM could not independently establish that Khan's tweet and the YouTube video are related to one and the same incident. However, we were able to trace the viral video to 2015 which means it has nothing to do with the abrogation of Article 370 which happened on August 5, 2019.", "lang": "en"}
