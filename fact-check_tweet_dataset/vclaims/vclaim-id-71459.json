No, that's not true: The photo shared widely on social media is of a notorious internet troll who has fooled major news outlets on several instances in recent years. It is not Officer Derek Chauvin, who was fired after Floyd's death. Another photo of a man on stage at a Donald Trump rally and identified in some posts as Chauvin is also not the officer, according to the Minneapolis Police Union president.\n\nThe red-hat photo appeared in a post shared on the \"Progressive American Politics\" page (archived here) on May 26, 2020. The post read:\n\nThis is what the red hat post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nThe man in the photo wearing the red hat is not Chauvin. Chauvin is the uniformed officer in the other photo with his knee on Floyd's neck.\n\nThe man wearing the red hat appears to be Jonathan Riches, a notorious troll who spent time in prison for wire fraud. The Huffington Post covered Riches' trolling of multiple politicians including Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.\n\nNBC New reporter Brandy Zadrozny reported the man in the MAGA-style hat was Riches, not Chauvin.\n\nThe Facebook image of uniformed Chauvin showing him pinning down Floyd is from the viral video of the incident, in which Floyd says he can't breathe multiple times before losing consciousness.\n\nWhile the photo was taken down on several Twitter accounts, rapper Ice Cube, whose real name is O'Shea Jackson, still had the photo up on May 27.\n\nTwitter accounts also showed photos of a man on stage at a President Donald Trump rally in October 2019, misidentifying the man on stage as Chauvin, according to the Minneapolis police union.\n\nMinneapolis news station FOX9 reported that Minneapolis Police Union President Lt. Bob Kroll, who spoke at the Trump rally, said Chauvin is not the officer in the photo.\n\nOne Facebook post sharing this image was accompanied with the message:\n\nThis is video of the Trump rally in Minneapolis in October, 2019.\n\nChauvin and the three other police officers at the scene with Floyd have been fired.\n\nHere is video from the TODAY Show that shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd and the news report of the incident.", "lang": "en"}
