Energy and power-related PSUs rule the roost, with oil and gas exploration company ONGC and power-generation company NTPC donating \u20b9300 crores and \u20b9250 crores respectively. The information also shows that many PSUs, such as ONGC and oil marketing company Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (abbreviated HPCL, which is owned by ONGC) have dipped into their CSR (corporate social responsiblity) funds, which are yet to be earmarked for the ongoing financial year.\n\nIE filed RTI queries with 55 PSUs, and received 38 responses, with the data pertaining to the period March 27 to August 13. \n\n\n\nThese numbers are significant, as the PM CARES fund has been facing flak for not being transparent about the true extent of the donations it has received since being established on March 27 this year. This leaves only estimates of the holistic and actual collection for the fund, with the Prime Minister's Office repeatedly mentioning that the fund does not fall under the purview of the RTI Act. This was once again shown in a response obtained by IE. When the fund was established, its also faced questions on doing so in the first place due to the presence of a pre-existing Prime Minister's National Relief Fund.\n\nAlso Read:PM Cares Vs PM National Relief Fund: All You Need To Know\n\nThe fund shows through its website that it has collected \u20b93,076.62 crores in 2019 - 2020 (a period of 5 days since its establishment).

HPCL has admitted to contributing \u20b9120 crores from its CSR budget for the ongoing financial year which is yet to be finalised.\n\nPower Finance Corporation was one PSU that contributed more than its CSR allocation. While its contribution this financial year has been \u20b9200 crores towards the fund, its CSR budget estimate for the the ongoing year is just north of \u20b9150 crores.\n\nLast (financial) year, the Airports Authority of India also contributed \u20b915 crores from a CSR allocation of \u20b983.79 crores.\n\n\n\nSome PSUs have dipped into their CSR budgets across financial years: the ongoing and previous one.\n\nOIL India Limited has contributed \u20b913 crores in the previous financial year, and \u20b925 crores in the ongoing one.
