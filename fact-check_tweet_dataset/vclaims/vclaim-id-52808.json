Some memorials, including the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C., and the Robert Gould Shaw and Massachusetts 54th Regiment Memorial in Boston, have been defaced during such protests.\n\nThe Facebook post features two photos: one of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and one of a bench commemorating the Marine Corps in Pensacola, Florida. It suggests both were damaged during recent protests, with the caption saying, \u201cOf course this was to honor George Floyd right?\u201d\n\nThrough a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered that the top image dates back to 2016. The Philly Voice included the photo in a March 2016 report about a vandal allegedly stealing several star medallions from the memorial.

The caption for the file photo reads, \u201cThe Marine Corps commemorative bench at Veterans Memorial Park in Pensacola was mysteriously damaged, possibly by vandals, in June 2012. The Vietnam Veterans Legacy Motorcycle Club paid $1,000 for a new bench, which was installed in September 2012.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time social media users have shared photos of memorials along with false claims that people vandalized them during protests. The Daily Caller recently debunked the claim that \u201crioters\u201d defaced the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in D.C. with graffiti.", "lang": "en"}
