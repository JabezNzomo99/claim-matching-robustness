It further claims that the Gates Foundation is secretly planting bill gates microchips when patients\u2019 noses or throats are swabbed during COVID-19 testing. Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral claim is false.\n\nThe post doing rounds on Facebook claims that there\u2019s no coronavirus pandemic! It further states that what we\u2019re really doing is implanting Bill Gates\u2019 microchip and the Gates Foundation is paying $25k per implanted chip. The complete post can be read in its archived version here.\n\nAs per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), COVID19 testing can be done on samples obtained by various methods, including a nasopharyngeal swab, sputum (coughed up material), throat swabs, etc. There are certain Specimen Handling and Storage guidelines that are followed after swab collection. There are no reports that state COVID19 testing implants microchips in the throat.\n\nDuring our investigation, we came across a report titled: \u201cBill Gates will use microchip implants to fight coronavirus\u201d. The report includes a quote from a Q&A with Reddit about COVID-19: \u201cEventually we will have some digital certificates to show who has recovered or been tested recently or when we have a vaccine who has received it.\u201d\n\nAs per a Reuters report on the same subject, Bill Gates did mention the possibility of having a \u201cdigital certificate\u201d for health records \u201ceventually,\u201d but he did not say these certificates would be \u201cmicrochip implants.\u201d\n\nVishvas News contacted Gates Foundation over mail. They replied: \u201cThank you for enquiring to us. This is a fake news that Gates Foundation is planting microchips during swab testing.\u201d They also referred to the Reuters article where they\u2019ve debunked a similar claim. It stated that: Bill Gates foresees the use of \u201cdigital certificates\u201d with health records, but did not say these would be in the form of microchip implants. There are no plans to use this future technology during the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nWhen we scanned the profiled of the user we found that the user is based out of United States.\n\nConclusion: No, Gates Foundation is not planting microchips during COVID19 swab testing. Viral post is fake.", "lang": "en"}
