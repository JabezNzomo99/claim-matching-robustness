The first was a viral quote: \u201cSocks is the White House cat. But did you know there is also a White House dog?\u201d \u2013 Rush Limbaugh, holding a pic of 13-year-old Chelsea Clinton on TV, 1993.\u201d\n\nThe second was a video clip containing a similar insult. In the clip, Limbaugh says, \u201cLet\u2019s see who is the cute kid in the White House,\u201d and then he shows a picture of a dog:\n\nWe have been unable to find audio, video, or an official transcript for the viral quote starting \u201cSocks is the White House cat.\u201d However, the remark wasn\u2019t conjured out of thin air. This quote was first reported on by Molly Ivins in an Oct. 17, 1993, article published in the Arizona Republic entitled \u201cRiding the Powerless for a Laugh.\u201d\n\nBeing attacked by Rush Limbaugh is like being gummed by a newt. The current champion of the ad hominem argument has seen fit to reflect on me because I quoted what I still think is one of the funniest examples of white-backlash thinking I have ever come across. The quote in question was the immortal observation, made by a Limbaugh listener at a coffee group in Weatherford, Texas, in August, \u201cWhy, I agree with Rush that racism is dead. I just wonder what the n*ggers are going to find to complain about now.\u201d This quote caused some Limbaugh \u201cdittohead,\u201d as he calls his followers (Do you suppose they are actually flattered by that?), to call, gobbling with outrage, which seems to be a constant condition with many dittoheads, to demand how I dared accuse Rush of racism. Sigh. What I really hold against Limbaush is that many of the people who listen to him seem so singularly unable to reason their way out of a paper bag. Although we have no hard evidence of this as yet, I infer that this is a consequence of listening to the The Master several hours a day. Perhaps it is not fair to hold a radio talk-show host responsible for the several idiocies of his listeners, so let\u2019s consider Limbaugh himself. Here is a Limbaugh joke: Everyone knows the Clintons have a cat. Socks is the White House cat. But did you know there is also a White House dog?\u201d And he puts up a picture of Chelsea Clinton. Chelsea Clinton is 13 years old.\n\nA clipping of this newspaper article appears below:\n\nIvins provided no information about when Limbaugh made this remark, and it\u2019s unclear if this was a paraphrased version of something he said or a direct quote.\n\nAs for the viral video clip, the segment reportedly aired on Nov. 6, 1992. President Bill Clinton had just won election and Limbaugh was commenting on a New York Daily News article about what was coming \u201cIN\u201d to the White House with the Clinton family and what was going \u201cOUT\u201d of the White House with the Bush family.\n\nHere\u2019s a transcript of the segment from Media Matters:\n\nLIMBAUGH: Thank you. This show\u2019s era of dominant influence is just beginning. We are now the sole voice of sanity, the sole voice of reason. We are the sole voice of opposition on all television. This is the only place you can tune to to get the truth of the opposition of the one-party dictatorial government that now will soon run America. Oh, I mean, we are only beginning to enjoy dominance and prosperity. Most of these things on the in-out list are not even funny, but a couple of them\u2013one of them in particular is. David Hinckley of\u2013of the New York Daily News wrote this, and what he has\u2013he\u2019s got\u2013it\u2019s very strange. He says, In: A cute kid in the White House. Out: Cute dog in the White House.\u2019 Could\u2013could we see the cute kid? Let\u2019s take a look at\u2013see who is the cute kid in the White House. LIMBAUGH: (Voiceover) No, no, no. That\u2019s not the kid.\n\nThis segment was also featured in a 1995 Frontline special entitled \u201cRush Limbaugh\u2019s America.\u201d\n\nWhile we haven\u2019t found video of the full segment, a transcript shows how Limbaugh launched into an attack on another former White House child (he called Amy Carter, the daughter of President Jimmy Carter and Rosalynn Carter, the \u201cthe most unattractive presidential daughter in the history of the country\u201d) and then \u201capologized\u201d for the Chelsea Clinton mix-up, blaming the crew for showing a picture of a dog instead of Chelsea.\n\nHere\u2019s a transcript of the show (emphasis ours):\n\nLIMBAUGH: That was a terrible thing. That \u2014 that was an absolutely terrible \u2014 I am \u2014 I am sorry. You know, I just \u2014 the end of the week, the pressure\u2019s on \u2014 actually the pressure\u2019s off, and I relaxed a little bit too much. You know, when my radio show started in August of 1988, a presidential campaign then, and Amy Carter was protesting everything American while at Brown University. And I didn\u2019t, of course, like that. I didn\u2019t like her protesting everything American, and I made a remark on my show that I\u2019ve now since apologized for and I\u2019ve taken it back; I didn\u2019t mean it. I said, You know, she may be the most unattractive presidential daughter in the history of the country.\u2019 LIMBAUGH: Well, there was outrage. No, there was. I mean, there was just plenty \u2014 my \u2014 my mom called me at home that night. She said, Son, you know, you \u2014 if you\u2019re going to be serious about this, you can\u2019t make fun of the way people look. You\u2019re not supposed to \u2014 you\u2019re not \u2014 you can talk about how you disagree with Amy Carter. You can talk about how you disagree with her politics and you think she\u2019s doing some bad things, but she can\u2019t help the way she looks, and you can\u2019t \u2014 you shouldn\u2019t make fun of that. And, besides, you forgot Margaret Truman.\u2019 LIMBAUGH: There I go. My friends, I apologize again. I \u2014 that\u2019s the third time the crew makes a mistake by showing you Millie the dog when I intended to show you Chelsea Clinton, and then I followed with that terrible story. I\u2019m \u2014 I hope you\u2019ll forgive me. I\u2019m fatigued. I\u2019m tired. I really don\u2019t \u2014 in fact, you know what I\u2019ll do? Let\u2019s pretend this is a daytime talk show and that I\u2019m a guest on, say, Sally, Phil or whatever. How can I make amends to you for what I just did? I can spank myself. People who spank themselves, next RUSH. Watch this. (Rush stands) I\u2019ll do it with my left hand. I \u2014 I\u2019m right-handed, so it won\u2019t hurt as much. Do it with my left hand. LIMBAUGH: We\u2019ll be back with the rest of our show in a moment.\n\nLimbaugh issued another apology a few days later on his show:\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I\u2019m sorry. Let me tell you very quickly what happened last Friday night. There was a new in list and new out list that was published in the newspaper. The writer said in, cute kid in the White House; out, cute dog in the White House. Could we show the cute dog in the White House who\u2019s out, and they put up a picture of Chelsea Clinton back in the crew. And many of you people think that we did it on purpose to make a cheap comment on her appearance. And I\u2019m terribly sorry. I don\u2019t \u2014 look, that takes no talent whatsoever and I have a lot of talent. I don\u2019t need to get laughs by commenting on people\u2019s looks, especially a young child who\u2019s done nothing wrong. I mean, she can\u2019t control the way she looks. And we really \u2014 we do not \u2014 we do not do that on this kind of show. So put a picture up of her now and so we can square this. LIMBAUGH: All right. We\u2019re sorry. We didn\u2019t intend to hurt her feelings. We\u2019ll be back with our final segment right after this. Don\u2019t go away.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Limbaugh referred to Chelsea as a dog twice. The first, shortly after Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential election in November 1992. And the second, sometime in 1993. However, it seems likely that the quote reported by Ivins (starting \u201cEveryone knows the Clintons have a cat\u201d) is a paraphrased version of Limbaugh\u2019s comments from 1992.", "lang": "en"}
