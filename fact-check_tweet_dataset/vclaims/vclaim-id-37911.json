They referred us to his\n\nfor the event. While the claim that 4% of deaths were due to cancer specifically cites the WHO, the speech doesn\u2019t give clear sources for the other two claims.\n\nNigeria does not have a country-wide cancer registry yet, Prof Ima-Obong Ekanem told Africa Check.

So Osinbajo is correct on this score.\n\nIn Nigeria, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. Cervical cancer\n\nin women, followed by breast cancer. Non-communicable diseases caused 29% of all deaths,\n\nBut most deaths, including cancer-related deaths, were under-reported in Nigeria, Akande said. The problem started at the detection stage.\n\nCancer cases, he said, were \u201cunder-diagnosed because of low utilisation of health services and poor health seeking behaviour. The expertise and equipment to properly diagnose cancer is also not available in most facilities.\u201d\n\nAkande pointed to inaccurate cause of death records as a major challenge. Reasons for this included many patients dying at home, and autopsies not being done widely.\n\nOsinbajo said he was optimistic the country\u2019s\n\nwould help reduce the burden of cancer. This US$308 million strategy seeks to improve early detection, cancer care, drug access and data collection, among other things.\n\nIn our July 2018 report on\n\n, we found the latest data from the IARC estimated that\n\n71,571 people died of cancer in Nigeria in 2012.

Osinbajo\u2019s claim is therefore in the ballpark.\n\nThe vice president did not specify if he was referring to new or existing cases, or deaths.
