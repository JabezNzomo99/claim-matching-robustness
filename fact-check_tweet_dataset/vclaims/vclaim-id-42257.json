A message has gone viral on social media which claims that Bollywood actor Shahrukh Khan had donated Rs 45 crore to Pakistan. Many social media users on Facebook and Twitter have shared this message.\n\nAnother version of the same narrative suggested that there should be a \u2018surgical strike\u2019 on people like Shahrukh Khan, who have not uttered a word on the martyrdom of CRPF personnel.\n\nFake news circulating at least since 2017\n\nAlt News found a 2017 India TV broadcast which had earlier debunked this claim. In response to India TV, the media team of Shahrukh Khan had reportedly rubbished the claims. The response said that the rumours are baseless and the actor has not donated to the victims of Pakistan\u2019s infamous oil tanker blast of 2017. The fact-check concluded that the claim viral on social media is false.\n\nEarlier in 2017, media reports had emerged about an oil tanker overturning and exploding on the main highway from Karachi to Lahore. The accident had claimed the lives of over 190 people. Social media users had taken to Twitter and Facebook alleging that Khan had donated a sum of Rs 45 crore to the victims of the oil tanker blast. In the past as well, users had also shared a trimmed version of the India TV broadcast to claim the same.\n\nA false and malicious narrative against Bollywood actor Shahrukh Khan has been relentlessly shared on social media even after being debunked by several media outlets in the past. Director Hansal Mehta has also tweeted about the fake news doing the rounds on social media.", "lang": "en"}
