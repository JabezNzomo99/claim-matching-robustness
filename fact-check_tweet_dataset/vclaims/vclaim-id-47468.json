Obama has been publicly supportive of vaccines in the past.\n\nThe viral post suggests that Obama called for Africans to not accept vaccines from the United States and Europe because they are part of a \u201cMachiavellian plan.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the full quote attributed to Obama:\n\nI\u2019ll be an accomplice if I don\u2019t denounce this evil act white people want to do to Africans, first of all I was born in America but I\u2019m African blood, I\u2019m not going to allow white people to kill Africans with their toxic vaccines, I ask Africans to be smart, and to ensure that coronavirus vaccines do not enter African territories, there is a Machiavellian plan they invent, saying we come to help Africans, or that they will come to kill you, I will let this message be shared everywhere, to awaken African minds so that the vaccines do not arrive in Africa.\n\nThere is, however, no evidence that Obama ever made this statement. No news reporting could be found to corroborate the alleged quote. The Daily Caller News Foundation also searched Obama\u2019s Twitter account and ProPublica\u2019s archive of his deleted tweets, but didn\u2019t turn up any matches.\n\nThe message contradicts Obama\u2019s record on vaccines. In February 2015, he publicly encouraged parents to vaccinate their children, for instance. (RELATED: Did Ilhan Omar Say That \u2018All White Men Should Be Put In Chains\u2019?)\n\nKatie Hill, his spokeswoman, confirmed to The Associated Press that Obama didn\u2019t say the alleged quote and is pro-vaccination.\n\nThe quote stemmed from a recent controversy in which two French doctors suggested during a television segment that a tuberculosis vaccine be tested in Africa as a potential treatment for coronavirus, according to The Associated Press. The fake Obama quote started circulating around the same time the controversy received significant social media attention in early April.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
