No vaccine against the novel coronavirus is currently available.\n\nThe viral post uses the image of a canine coronavirus vaccine to suggest that the novel 2019 coronavirus isn\u2019t new. It also speculates about the existence of a human vaccine against COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.\n\n\u201cCan anyone explain to me why they made a Corona virus vaccine a year ago for K9s but are acting like this shit is a new virus that came from China just recently?\u201d reads the post. \u201cIf they have a vaccine for dogs, don\u2019t u think they wud have one for humans too? Wtf is the government tryin to pull on us really?\u201d\n\nThe pictured vaccine, however, actually prevents a coronavirus that causes gastrointestinal issues in dogs. It only works for that canine virus and is \u201cnot effective for the prevention of COVID-19,\u201d according to the VCA Hospital website.\n\nCanine coronavirus is part of the same family of viruses as the novel human coronavirus but is distinct from it. The novel coronavirus had not been previously identified before emerging in China in December, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) website states that no vaccine to prevent COVID-19 is currently available.
