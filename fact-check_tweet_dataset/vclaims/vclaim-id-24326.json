The only thing he had in his shopper was the clothes of his mom & sister who were killed in Syria\u2019. Let\u2019s try to verify the claims made in the post.\n\nClaim: The boy\u2019s mother and sister were killed in Syria and he was migrating alone through the desert. Fact: The boy\u2019s family members weren\u2019t dead. He wasn\u2019t even travelling alone through the desert; he was accompanied by other refugees. He got temporarily separated from his family while migrating from Syria to Jordan and was later united with his mother. Hence, the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image in the post is run through Google Reverse Image Search technique, it was found in an article published by \u201cBBC News\u201d in 2014. The photo in the post was first tweeted on Twitter by Andrew Harper, head of the UN refugee agency UNHCR in Jordan. In his tweet that enclosed this photo, he wrote, \u201cHere 4 year old Marwan, who was temporarily separated from his family, is assisted by UNHCR staff to cross #Jordan\u201d.\n\nThis photo went viral when CNN International reporter Hala Gorani tweeted it saying \u201cUN staff found 4 year old Marwan crossing desert alone after being separated from family fleeing #Syria\u201d. But on finding the authenticity of the photo, he has deleted his tweet. Below is a screenshot of his tweet that was obtained from the \u201cTimes of Israel\u201d article which wrote about the image posted.\n\nAndrew Harper told the BBC that the boy (Marwan) has got temporarily separated from his family at the remote Hagallat crossing and was found by the staff from the UN\u2019s refugee agency. Harper clarified that Marwan was taken by them and was reunited with his mother about 10 minutes after that picture was taken.\n\nAndrew Harper has even made another tweet with the photo that shows Marawan at the back of a group of refugees.\n\nSo, the story in the post along with the photograph of the boy is a fabricated one. To sum it up, the boy\u2019s family members weren\u2019t dead. He wasn\u2019t even migrating alone through the desert. He got temporarily separated from his family and later reunited with his mother.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
