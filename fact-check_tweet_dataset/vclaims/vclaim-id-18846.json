It includes a distorted account of a discussion from the June 27, 2018, episode of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d hosted by Nicolle Wallace.\n\nTo begin with, the story, which is littered with grammatical errors, says: \u201cMSNBC h\u0430v\u0435 Nicolle W\u0430ll\u0430\u0441\u0435 \u0440\u0435t\u0456t\u0456\u043en\u0435d G\u043ed f\u043er a subsidence \u043en Thursday so President D\u043en\u0430ld Trum\u0440 would l\u043e\u0455\u0435 r\u0435-\u0430\u0440\u0440\u043e\u0456ntm\u0435nt in 2020.\u201d Wallace didn\u2019t say anything about God and the clip, as we noted, is from over a year ago. Also, President Donald Trump is up for re-election in 2020, not \u201cre-appointment.\u201d\n\nThe story then goes on to include a warped version of an exchange between Wallace and one of her guests, writer and presidential historian Jon Meacham.\n\nThe exchange happened while Wallace and the show\u2019s panel discussed the state of the U.S. economy and the relationship between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. It actually went like this:\n\nThe story has been shared more than 12,000 times on Facebook, according to data from CrowdTangle.\n\nThe website that posted it, USlibertywire.club, was created in December 2018, according to domain registration records.\n\nThe site calls itself \u201cToday Trump News\u201d on its header, but refers to itself as \u201cConservative-Daily\u201d on its \u201cAbout Us\u201d page \u2014 which includes text that appears to be copied from the \u201cAbout Us\u201d page of Conservative-Daily.com. USlibertywire.club appears to have also copied from another website, CNSnews.com, for its \u201cterms of use\u201d page. CNSnews.com is run by the Media Research Center, which describes itself as working to \u201cexpose and neutralize the propaganda arm of the Left: the national news media.\u201d\n\nOther stories on USlibertywire.club include partisan click bait and some well-worn fake quotes attributed to celebrities, including one supposedly from actor Keanu Reeves that we\u2019ve written about before.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
