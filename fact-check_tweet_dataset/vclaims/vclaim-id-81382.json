In fact, the video shows a medical evacuation\n\nYou may have seen viral posts on Nigerian social media this week claiming that a helicopter came to the Benin-Ore part of the Lagos-Benin road to pick up a billionaire who was stuck in traffic. Another version says the chopper came in to pick up the girlfriend of a Nigerian \u201cbig boy\u201d. But the company operating the helicopter has dismissed claims that it was simply picking up a VIP annoyed by the gridlock -- its chief operating officer says it was performing an evacuation for a person in need of urgent medical care.\n\nThe reports sparked conversations around wealth and poverty in Nigeria. Many comments on social media were critical of the behaviour of the super-rich, while others expressed admiration for how the wealthiest in Nigerian society are able to get ahead. Many ended their comments with the popular saying: \u201cGod punish poverty\u201d.\n\nAn Instagram video of the helicopter landing on the expressway, which we\u2019ve archived here, has been viewed more than 50,000 times. \u201cReal Luxury Lifestyle....the Power of Money....picking up a VIP who is stuck in traffic on the Lagos Benin Expressway,\u201d reads the caption.\n\nA Nigerian theatre and voice actor, Deyemi Okanlawon, also put up the video with the caption: \u201cFather in heaven please let me be able to do this for wifey... there was a 5 hour TRAFFIC hold-up at ORE today and one \u2018big boy\u2019 sent a chopper to pick up his CHICK! Though I joke about this please note that this is actually lawlessness!\u201d His post, archived here, has been seen more than 34,000 times.\n\nMany Nigerian newspapers and blogs also reported that the helicopter came in to pick up a billionaire who was trying to get away from the traffic.\n\nPM News reported that \u201cthe unnamed billionaire was said to have called a helicopter to pick him up from the traffic snare and to everyone\u2019s consternation\u201d. We\u2019ve archived blog posts carrying similar claims here and here.\n\n\u201cNigerian man calls for his helicopter to be used to take him to his destination, after being stuck in Lagos traffic for hours,\u201d read the caption on one tweet carrying the video, which was retweeted more than 4,500 times.\n\n\u201cWhy not just build nice roads in Nigeria,\u201d suggested one reply to the tweet. \u201cYou could save yourself from this national embarrassment.\u201d\n\nBut Tropical Arctic Logistics (TAL), the company that operated the helicopter, clarified at a press conference in Lagos on Thursday that it was performing a licensed medical evacuation.\n\n\u201cWe were therefore surprised when our attention was drawn to several reports making the rounds on social media as well as unfounded statements by some news houses about our AW 139 aircraft making unauthorised diversion on the Lagos-Benin expressway just to pick an individual caught in gridlock,\u201d said the company\u2019s chief operating officer Femi Adeniji.\n\nAdeniji said the helicopter was dispatched to \u201cairlift an individual who suffered a serious health challenge while caught in traffic and needed emergency evacuation\u201d. He added that the company was \u201csaddened that such a life-saving endeavour has been painted in a negative light\u201d on social media.\n\nThe company refused to give details of the person in question, but it said the Nigeria Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) approved the flight planning. The BBC reported that the passenger was a man who had suffered a stroke.\n\nAdeniji said no laws were broken in the operation, and that TAL has not received any query from the regulators. The company has a contract with Flying Doctors, an air ambulance service in Nigeria, he added.", "lang": "en"}
