The image shows two dozen wolves walking in single file through the snow.\n\nThree wolves in front are circled, as are five behind them. Another five wolves towards the back are also marked, and an arrow points to one wolf straggling behind.\n\nThe explanation is that the three wolves in front are \u201cold and sick\u201d. They are there to set the pace, to make sure the rest of the wolves don\u2019t leave them behind.\n\nThe next five, and the five at the back, are the strongest, the meme says. They\u2019re there to protect the 10 or so ordinary pack members between them.\n\nAnd the lone wolf behind the rest? He\u2019s the leader. \u201cHe ensures no one is left behind. He keeps the pack tight and on the same path. He is ready to run in any direction to protect his pack.\u201d\n\nIt is a valuable and humane idea: the weaker members of a group set the pace, the stronger members are always ready to protect everyone else, and the leader walks behind to take care of the entire team.\n\nBut it\u2019s not a lesson we can learn from these wolves.\n\ntracked the original to a photo by\n\n.
