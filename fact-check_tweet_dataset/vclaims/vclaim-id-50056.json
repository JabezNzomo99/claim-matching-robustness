The novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19 only emerged at the end of 2019, so the suggestion being made was that the institute had identified this virus much earlier and lodged a \"patent\" for it.\n\nThe Gates Foundation is one of the world's largest supporters of global health projects, and The Pirbright is quite open about its funding from there for research linked to vaccines. However, that funding isn't related to any work for which a patent has been taken out.\n\n\"It's great to be able to get involved in this research and see if we can learn more about the novel coronavirus. This will be really important when developing effective vaccines.\"", "lang": "en"}
