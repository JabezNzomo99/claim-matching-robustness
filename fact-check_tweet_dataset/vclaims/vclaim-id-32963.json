It is also claimed that Asaduddin Owaisi got injured in this attack. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Photos of the attack on Muslims by RSS men in Telangana. Fact: The photos in the post does not belong to the state of Telangana. Also, these photos were not taken recently (one was taken in 2017 and the other in 2006). Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched for the news on this issue on Google, no latest news was found related to RSS workers attacking Muslims in Telangana or Owaisi getting hurt in the attack. In the post, there are two photos. Let\u2019s try to check when and where those photos were taken.\n\nWhen this image in the post wan run through the Google Reverse Image Search, the same picture was found to be uploaded on Adobe Stock by \u2018Cathal Mcnaughton / Reuters\u2019 in April-2017. The description for the picture reads, \u201cHindu Yuva Vahin vigilante members take part in a rally in the city of Unnao\u201d. So, this photo was not taken in Telangana.\n\nOn Google Reverse Image Search, this photo was found in a photo-essay (\u20182006: India Grieved\u2019) published by the \u2018Outlook\u2019 magazine in December 2006. The description below the picture reads, \u201cAt least two people were killed and dozens injured in communal clashes in Mangalore and adjoining areas after a van carrying cattle to a slaughter house was stopped by Bajrang Dal activists.\u201d So, this photo was taken 13 years back in Mangalore (Karnataka), not in Telangana.\n\nTo sum it up, old and unrelated images are being shared as \u2018RSS attack on Muslims in Telangana\u2019. There is no news of such an attack taking place.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
