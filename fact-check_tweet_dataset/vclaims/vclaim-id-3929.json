Trump, who was supposedly the cousin of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, began circulating online in February 2016. The obituary included message allegedly penned by Thomas before his death, imploring citizens of the United States not to vote his \u201cwalking mucus bag\u201d of a cousin into office:\n\nThis image was first posted to the web site Imgur on 3 February 2016, from which the Facebook group \u201cThe People\u2019s Efforts\u201d picked it up the following day and shared it as if it were a real news item.\n\nThis obituary, however, is a fake.\n\nThe Obituary.com web site shows no record of a man named Thomas P. Trump\u2019s having passing away in January 2016. While there is a record for a Thomas W. Trump, that man was not Donald Trump\u2019s cousin, nor was he the man pictured in the obituary shown above. In fact, the photograph used in this fake obit was a cropped version of a picture of a man in Santa Barbara that was posted to Flickr in 2006:\n\nI met this man today at the base of a very long stairway. we exchange \u201chappy easter\u2019s\u201d. when i came back from a thirty minute walk, he had managed to go up three of the seven flights of stairs. he seemed very happy to be alive. he was joyful and hard of hearing. he quite happily insisted that i take his photo :-)\n\nThe man pictured here was John Pat Cooper, not Donald Trump\u2019s fictional cousin Thomas P. Trump.", "lang": "en"}
