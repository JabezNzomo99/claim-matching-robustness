Would it really be Sanders accepting the nomination this week at the DNC if not for superdelegates?\n\nSuperdelegates, if you\u2019ll remember from our primer, are the party officials and bigshots who make up about one-sixth of the delegates in the Democratic Party\u2019s system. Under the rules that governed this year\u2019s primaries, the superdelegates weren\u2019t bound to the voting results in their state and could vote for whomever they wish.\n\nMany superdelegates backed Clinton before voting even began, and she commanded a disproportionate lead in superdelegates throughout the primaries, eliciting many cries of unfairness and cronyism from voters and Sanders supporters.\n\nBut Trump is wrong. Sanders would not have won the primary without these party insiders.\n\nThe Trump campaign didn\u2019t get back to us, but the \"analysis\" he may have been referring to could be a blog post on Gateway Pundit, a conservative newsblog.\n\nThe post\u2019s headline is \"NOTE TO SANDERS SUPPORTERS: Bernie Would Have Won If Not for Super Delegate System!\" It makes a flawed argument that Sanders would have nabbed the nomination if all of the Clinton superdelegates backed him instead.\n\nThat math checks out on paper, but it is nonsensical in reality. The post offers no rationale for why the superdelegates should flip their votes against the popular vote (Clinton won 3.8 million more than Sanders). Experts told PolitiFact Florida that superdelegates could have played a difference if the race was closer. And to top it off, Sanders himself repeatedly advocated for superdelegates to follow the will of their state\u2019s voters.\n\nIn other scenarios, such as binding superdelegates to their state\u2019s vote proportionally or taking them out of the system all together, Sanders would have still been unable to reach the magical 2,383-threshold of delegates needed to capture the nomination and would still trail Clinton.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of how many superdelegates Clinton and Sanders would have received under different primary systems, based on Green Papers\u2019 superdelegate count.\n\nThe bottom line: Binding the superdelegates to the winner of their state\u2019s primary or caucus would have closed the delegate gap between Clinton and Sanders, but it wouldn\u2019t have been enough for Sanders to win.\n\nTrump tweeted, \"An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.\"\n\nThis does not check out. Sanders would have still lost without superdelegates in the mix, because Clinton won a majority of the popular vote and pledged delegates.\n\nOn the contrary, the only way for Sanders to have won is he would have been able to persuade more superdelegates to switch their votes from Clinton to him.", "lang": "en"}
