Some users are even giving political colours to incidents which are not even remotely related to politics.\n\nA tweet having some disturbing photos of a woman has surfaced. It claimed that the woman got her hair pulled out forcefully, exposing the major portion of her scalp and also warned people to save their sisters and daughters from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claim is false. The incident happened in Gujarat was just an accident and had nothing to do with the BJP or any other political party.\n\nThe archived version of the tweet can be seen here.\n\nA user, Sumit Bhukal tweeted three photos of a woman. Two photos of the tweet are extremely disturbing as they show her exposed scalp after her hair got pulled out.\n\nThe tweet claimed the photos are of a 22-year-old Dalit woman, whose hair was mercilessly pulled out leaving her scalp skin hanging. The tweet said that one of her ear and finger's were also cut and people should save their sisters and daughters from BJP if they can.\n\n\"Yeh kisi grah ke gaddho ki tasveer nahi apitu ek 22 saal ki yuvti ka berehmi se jabran ukhade gaye baalo ka latakta maas hai. Gujarat me dalit ladki ke sir ke baal ukhade kaan aur ungli bhi kaati @BJP4India se bacha sako to bacha lo apni behen-beti ko,\" it said.\n\nMany users started slamming the party on Twitter trusting the facts given on the post. According to his twitter account, Sumit Bhukal is a resident of Barwala in Haryana's Hisar district. He claims to be a dedicated volunteer of the Congress\n\nFacebook users Prakash Chand and Syed Danish Taj also posted the photos with a similar claim including the name of PM Narendra Modi. By the time of filing the story, the posts were already shared more than 800 times. The same photos also went viral last year with similar claims.\n\nOn reverse search, the photos we found were from some news articles published in May 2018. According to these news reports, this incident was from Mandavdhar village near Gadhda in Gujarat.\n\nThe woman in the photos went to meet her boyfriend who used to operate drilling machines for wells and bore wells. When she expressed her curiosity to see the process, they both entered the well. However, her hair got entangled in the moving belt of a machine. She tried to free herself, but in the struggle one of her thumbs got chopped and she suffered an injury on an ear too.\n\nThe incident was reported by several prominent media houses. Her boyfriend was arrested and later got bail. However, none of the media reports mentioned any political connection with the incident.", "lang": "en"}
