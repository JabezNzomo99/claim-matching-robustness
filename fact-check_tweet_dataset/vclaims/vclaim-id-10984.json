For this reason, the verdict has also been changed from \u201cunclear\u201d to \u201cmisleading.\u201d\n\nOn October 20, Macedonia\u2019s parliament held a critical vote on changing the country\u2019s official name from the Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of Northern Macedonia. The name change would finally satisfy the demands of the Balkan nation\u2019s neighbor, Greece, which has long blocked Macedonia\u2019s efforts to enter the European Union and NATO due to the name controversy. The measure passed in parliament with the required two-thirds majority after eight members of parliament broke with their own party\u2019s position and voted with the majority coalition.\n\nThe vote, one of several planned parliamentary votes before the constitution can be officially amended, follows Macedonia\u2019s September 30 referendum, in which 90 percent of voters supported the name change, but overall turnout was below the 50 percent threshold required by the country\u2019s election commission. The parliamentary vote went forward despite the low turnout due to the fact that the referendum was considered \u201cnon-binding,\u201d and the constitution can only be changed via parliament.\n\nFrom the beginning, Russia has opposed the name change vote, since it would lead to Macedonia joining the EU and NATO. Russian media encouraged Macedonians to boycott the vote. In August, Polygraph.info debunked reports by the Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti that Macedonia\u2019s largest opposition party was officially boycotting the referendum. It did not. Another Russian state news outlet, Sputnik, claimed that most Macedonians were opposed to NATO and EU membership, but polls showed the opposite.\n\nAfter Macedonia\u2019s parliament passed the name-change, Russia claimed that the U.S. had masterminded and supervised the voting process in parliament to ensure the \u201cright\u201d result. Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry alleged, without evidence, that members of Macedonia\u2019s parliament were offered bribes and/or blackmailed in order to secure their votes. It also claimed that members of parliament were \u201clocked\u201d in rooms and that their cell phones were confiscated. Again, the Russian Foreign Ministry provided no corroboration for these claims. Polygraph.info attempted to reach the Russian Foreign Ministry for further clarification, but the ministry did not respond to an e-mail inquiry.\n\nIt is true that the U.S. openly supported the name change, and even sent a senior diplomat to Skopje as a show of support. A U.S. State Department official denied the allegations of a U.S. hand in the matter, telling Polygraph.info, the allegations were \u201cabsurd.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny suggestion that U.S. Embassy officials were involved in the parliamentary vote process is patently false,\u201d the official wrote. \u201cThe United States welcomes the decision by Macedonia\u2019s Parliament to initiate the constitutional changes needed to implement the Prespa Agreement with Greece. The United States believes that the Prespa Agreement is a historic opportunity to advance stability, security, and prosperity throughout the region.\u201d\n\nAfter this story was originally published, the U.S. Embassy in Macedonia responded to our request for information on the whereabouts of the U.S. ambassador and other U.S. diplomats on the day of the vote.\n\n\u201cNeither Ambassador Baily nor any American diplomats were in Parliament on October 20,\u201d a spokesperson for the Embassy\u2019s Public Affairs Section wrote.\n\nMacedonia\u2019s parliament released a statement in response to the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s allegation, which was posted on the parliament\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Macedonia considers the allegations made in the comment to be completely unfounded and untrue, as well as presented with a clear tendency to compromise the political process which is of historic importance for the Republic of Macedonia and all its citizens,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThe MPs at the Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, in full conformity with all democratic principles and proscribed parliamentary procedure, adopted a decision that reflects the decades-long commitment of the Republic of Macedonia to membership in NATO and the European Union as its strategic priority enjoying the widest possible social consensus and one which has long since been well known to our Russian friends.\u201d\n\nAfter the allegations of bribery and pressure on members of Macedonia\u2019s parliament, Elizabeta Kanceska-Milevska, former Minister of Culture and one of the eight members who voted for the name change, went on Macedonian television to refute the claims about pressure and bribery.\n\n\u201cI made the decision to vote in that manner without any outside pressure, from either of the parties,\u201d she said in the interview. \u201cI firmly stand behind my decision. I personally believe that we should start the debate on the amendments and see where it take us. I call on anyone who suspects that bribing of any kind took place, to investigate further, and I say it publically, nobody offered me anything in exchange of a vote, neither the opposition nor the Government.\u201d\n\nIn the our initial analysis, our judgment was to make the verdict \u201cunclear.\" We changed our verdict from \u201cunclear\u201d to \u201cmisleading\u201d on Monday, October 29, after receiving a direct response from the U.S. Embassy regarding the whereabouts of the ambassador on that day. In its initial statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry did not provide any evidence to back up its charges. They did not respond to Polygraph.info's request for commentary on the matter.\n\nWe can go no further, at this time, with other questions still not answered \u2013 particularly In our query we sent questions to the Macedonian Foreign Ministry and parliament, asking specific questions about the detailed claims made by Russia -- such as the one about legislators being locked in rooms, their cellphones confiscated. We received no direct answers, only the statements detailed above.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that last week\u2019s vote will not be the final one to decide the issue of changing Macedonia\u2019s constitution and the country\u2019s name from the Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.", "lang": "en"}
