Lynch, did not believe they could win in court and balked at bringing charges. Once Ms. Lynch succeeded Mr. Holder in April 2015, however, Vanita Gupta, the head of the civil rights division, and her lawyers convinced Ms. Lynch that the officers had very likely violated Mr. Garner's civil rights. Ms. Lynch allowed the civil rights division to take a lead role in the case, and the following September the department replaced the F.B.I. agents and prosecutors who had been working on the case with a new team from outside of New York. The two sides disagreed over whether the widely published video of Mr. Garner's arrest proved that Officer Pantaleo had acted wrongfully. Prosecutors in Washington D.C. accused their colleagues in Brooklyn of mishandling the investigation. The case stalled again after Mr. Trump won the presidential election and appointed Jeff Sessions as his attorney general. Civil rights division prosecutors recommended to the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, that charges be brought, but he declined to move forward.\n\nA 2019 report on community policing by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights says: \u201cThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Garrity v. New Jersey that officers compelled to speak to investigators in order to avoid discipline may not have their statements \u2014 or other evidence obtained by means of those compelled statements \u2014 used against them in a criminal prosecution. In light of this ruling, departments have sought to delay administrative investigations to avoid even the slightest possibility of tainting subsequent criminal prosecutions. However, under this approach, the administrative investigation takes so long \u2014 sometimes more than a year \u2014 that the ability to obtain reliable statements from involved officers can be seriously compromised.\u201d\n\nThe NYPD\u2019s delay had a material effect. As Lowery reported, \u201cIn a typical administrative hearing, prosecutors would need only to prove that Pantaleo had violated department policy to get him disciplined or fired. But in this case, the years-long delay had worked in the officer\u2019s favor. Because so much time had passed, NYPD rules required prosecutors to prove both that Pantaleo had used a banned chokehold and that doing so rose to the level of criminal conduct.\u201d\n\nLast year, the New York Times reported: \u201c \u2018No one is dragging their feet,\u2019 Mr. de Blasio said on July 17, 2016, in response to a question about the process, which, even then, seemed unnecessarily delayed. \u2018Everything is being done meticulously because we want to make sure that what happens is fair to everyone involved.\u2019 \u201d After the administrative judge recommended Pantaleo\u2019s firing Aug. 2, de Blasio called it a \u201cfair and impartial process,\u201d but declined to say whether the officer should go.\n\nOne final point: At the debate, de Blasio tried to turn the delays in the Garner case into an attack on former vice president Joe Biden. \u201cMr. Vice President, tell us, what did you do to try and spur on the Justice Department to act in the Garner case?\u201d de Blasio said. Although the president has constitutional authority over the Justice Department, prosecutors are supposed to operate independently. The vice president, however, has no such authority.", "lang": "en"}
