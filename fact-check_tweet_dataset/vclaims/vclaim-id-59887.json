The image shows a Facebook post shared by another user with the same name.\n\nThe screen grabbed tweet shows a Facebook post, purportedly from the tennis star, that expresses frustration about divisions over current issues. The caption says Williams deserves \u201ccredit for winning another grand slam for this post.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of COVID-19. I\u2019m sick of black vs. white,\u201d Williams allegedly wrote. \u201cI\u2019m sick of Democrats vs. Republicans. I\u2019m sick of gay vs. straight. I\u2019m sick of Christians vs. atheists. I\u2019m REALLY sick of the media. I\u2019m sick of no one being allowed to think what they want & feel what they do without offending someone. I am sick of nosey ass people who call the cops when anyone does anything they don\u2019t approve of. I am sick of blaming the whole for the sins of a few.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no record of the tennis player authoring the viral post, despite multiple Facebook and Twitter users claiming the screen grab shows it on her page. (RELATED: Did Dr. Anthony Fauci Write This Viral Essay About COVID-19?)\n\nThe screen grab actually shows a June 14 post from a Facebook user who happens to share the same name as Williams. On that Facebook user\u2019s profile, she states, \u201cNope, not THAT Serena Williams.\u201d She also credits another Facebook user, Gina Torres, with the words that have garnered over 177,000 shares on her page.\n\nWilliams, the tennis player, has been vocal about racial injustice on social media. For example, she tweeted a Nike video addressing the issue on May 31, quoting, \u201cDon\u2019t pretend there\u2019s not a problem in America.\u201d She also told \u201cthose of you involved in equality movements like Black Lives Matter\u201d to \u201ckeep it up\u201d in a 2015 Wired article.", "lang": "en"}
