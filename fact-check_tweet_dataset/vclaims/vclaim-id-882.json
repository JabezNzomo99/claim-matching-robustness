Pat Toomey supported a \u201c$1,300 tax hike for working families.\u201d He did not.\n\nThe claim hinges on a Democratic committee staff analysis of Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s 2013 budget plan \u2014 which Toomey supported. That analysis made assumptions about tax deductions that could \u201cpotentially\u201d be eliminated, but such measures were never actually spelled out in the Ryan plan.\n\nThe attack ad comes from Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC devoted to electing Democrats to the U.S. Senate. Toomey, who represents Pennsylvania, is facing Democratic challenger Katie McGinty in a race the Cook Political Report rates as a tossup.\n\nThe ad portrays Toomey as a Wall Street insider and says that when he came to the Senate he supported \u201chuge tax breaks for millionaires but higher taxes on working families.\u201d Graphics in the ad are more specific, claiming that he supported a plan that would result in a \u201c$286,000 tax break for millionaires\u201d and a \u201c$1,300 tax hike for working families.\u201d\n\nSmall print in the ad notes that this refers to Toomey\u2019s vote in support of Ryan\u2019s 2013 budget plan, \u201cThe Path to Prosperity: A Blueprint for American Renewal,\u201d which failed to advance after a vote of 41-58. Ryan\u2019s plan called for consolidating tax brackets from the current seven rates \u2014 ranging from 10 percent to 39.6 percent \u2014 into just two, 10 percent and 25 percent. Those rate cuts would have resulted in tax cuts at every income level, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis. And they would have reduced revenue by more than $4.6 trillion over 10 years.\n\nRyan vowed to make the plan revenue neutral by eliminating unidentified tax deductions and closing unspecified tax loopholes. He never spelled out which ones. Ryan, who was then the chair of the House Budget Committee, left the revenue-raising details to the House Ways and Means Committee, which is the tax-writing panel.\n\nThe Democratic staff on the Senate\u2019s Joint Economic Committee made projections about the impact of Ryan\u2019s plan based on deductions that could \u201cpotentially\u201d have been eliminated if the plan were approved.\n\nSpecifically, the staff for committee chairman Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania concluded that if tax deductions for mortgage interest, state and local taxes, and charitable contributions, as well as the tax exclusions for employer-sponsored health insurance benefits and contributions to 401(k) plans, were eliminated, \u201cthe typical household making more than $1 million will see their taxes fall by more than $286,000 under Ryan\u2019s budget.\u201d At the same time, \u201ca household making between $50,000 and $100,000 would face a tax increase of at least $1,358,\u201d the report said.\n\nThat\u2019s the basis for the ad\u2019s claim. But note the use of the word \u201cpotentially\u201d in the report.\n\nThe Ryan plan didn\u2019t actually call for across-the-board elimination of tax deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions. As we said, the Ryan plan was silent on the specifics of which tax preferences would be eliminated or reduced in order to meet the goal of making his plan revenue neutral. (The Tax Policy Center\u2019s Howard Glickman was critical of Ryan for \u201cleaving the dirty work\u201d of how to pay for his proposed tax rate cuts to the House Ways and Means Committee.)\n\nRoberton Williams, the Sol Price fellow at the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told us we\u2019d have to know exactly which tax preferences would be changed, and how, before making a reliable prediction about how it would affect taxes at various income levels.\n\nFew elected officials from either side of the aisle have supported across-the-board elimination of home mortgage or charitable deductions, as the Joint Economic Committee\u2019s Democratic staff suggested could \u201cpotentially\u201d happen.\n\nAnd if those deductions were reduced, it is possible to structure the changes such that middle-income earners are not affected. For example, legislators could limit the value of itemized deductions to a certain percentage of adjusted gross income, even if one pays a higher tax rate. Obama, for example, has for years suggested limiting the value of itemized deductions to 28 percent. It is also possible to limit the total amount of itemized deductions to a specific dollar amount.\n\nIn 2014, Ryan said he would limit the home mortgage tax deduction to \u201cmiddle income people\u201d and would oppose eliminating deductions for contributions to charity for any income level.\n\nAnd in his own 2013 budget plan, Toomey was clear that he advocates a tax plan that cuts rates and \u201cmaintains progressivity\u201d by protecting middle-income earners from changes to the tax deductions.\n\nToomey FY 2013 Budget Resolution: The revenue lost from lower marginal rates will be offset by eliminating or reducing various tax expenditures in a manner that maintains progressivity. Tax preferences directed toward lower- and middle-income families, such as the child tax credit and earned income tax credit, will remain unchanged. However, many tax preferences are disproportionately utilized by upper-income taxpayers. Scaling back the use of these provisions will provide the revenue necessary to pay for the reduction of marginal tax rates. With the revenue loss associated with tax expenditures exceeding $1 trillion per year, there are many technical ways to limit the value of deductions and tax expenditures and thereby offset the cost of lowering marginal rates. One method put forward by Harvard economics professor Martin Feldstein and the president of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Maya MacGuineas, is to limit the value of tax expenditures to a certain percentage of adjusted gross income. Another option could involve limiting the total amount of itemized deductions to a specified dollar amount.\n\nToomey stopped short of endorsing either of those alternatives, and merely posed them as options. But the point is that it is possible to protect middle-income earners from changes to tax preferences.\n\nNo matter how tax preferences are handled, the Ryan plan would certainly result in higher-income earners seeing the most tax benefit, Williams of the Tax Policy Center told us. The rate cuts are simply too large for upper-income earners not to reap the biggest benefits. It almost certainly wouldn\u2019t work out to an average tax cut of $286,000 for millionaires \u2014 as the ad states \u2014 but the tax cut would be substantial, Williams said, and disproportionate compared with those making lower incomes.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean middle-income earners would necessarily pay $1,300 more, as the ad states. And an attack based on that assumption is even more baseless given that Toomey has proposed a tax plan that calls for protecting middle-income earners from changes to tax deductions.", "lang": "en"}
