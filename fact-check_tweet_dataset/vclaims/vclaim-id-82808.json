The criminal justice approach seeks to identify an event (such as an assault), determine when it occurred and learn as much about it as possible. The public health approach looks more at behaviors and seeks to stimulate memories, but it is less interested in legal definitions.\n\nSo a criminal justice approach might ask specifically whether someone was raped. But the public health approach would not ask that question directly, believing that rape victims are reluctant to identify themselves (or may not even realize that the act in question was indeed a rape). The hope is that questions about behaviors will increase disclosure and capture various types of unwanted sexual penetration. But it also means the analysts \u2014 not the respondent \u2014 determine whether the situation merits the label of rape.\n\nHowever, the Justice Department survey has long been criticized as an inadequate measure of rape. A National Research Council report in 2014 offered recommendations on how to improve it, saying it was \u201chighly likely\u201d it was underestimating the number of rapes. While the NRC report made no judgment on the CDC survey \u2014 since that was not part of its mandate \u2014 the panel noted how much higher the numbers were in the CDC report: \u201cThis differential between the NISVS and the other surveys is surprising.\u201d\n\nStill, it turns out that almost 50 percent of the rapes reported by the survey depend on this drunk/high/lack of consent section. More than 9 percent of the women \u2014 which adds up to an estimated 11.2 million people \u2014 were classified as rape victims as a result of this question. Lack of consent after alcohol abuse is certainly an important issue, one that college campuses are grappling with. But the eye-popping survey results depend heavily on the outcome of this section of the survey.\n\nUnder the heading of \u201cother sexual violence\u201d \u2014 which the study said affected an estimated 53 million women and 27 million men \u2014 the report lists something called \u201csexual coercion.\u201d This stems from a question concerning people who had sex after a partner did things like \u201ctelling you lies, making promises about the future they knew were untrue, threatening to end your relationship, or threatening to spread rumors about you.\u201d About 15 million women and nearly 7 million men were said to suffer from this form of sexual violence, as defined in the report.\n\nAnother form of \u201cother sexual violence\u201d is men reporting that they were \u201cmade to penetrate\u201d someone else. In this case, the findings are rather unusual. Over the preceding 12 months, the survey estimated 1.921 million men were made to have sex with someone else against their will \u2014 virtually the same number of women who were the victims of rape. (The incidence is even higher for men \u2014 1.7 percent versus 1.6 percent for women.) Only 17 percent of the male victims had a male perpetrator, so most of these incidents allegedly involve women forcing men to engage in sex.\n\nThe study of rape in the United States obviously is still a work in progress. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much that one survey\u2019s findings is better than the other\u2019s, but rather that the definitions and methodology used in the two surveys differ,\u201d said William D. Kalsbeek of the University of North Carolina, also a co-chair of the NRC report. \u201cIndeed, the consensus of the panel was that the best scientific design for a national survey on rape and sexual assault might be to follow the general survey design of NCVS which uses the broader operational definitions of rape and sexual assault used in NISVS.\u201d\n\nBut in this case, the president did not cite the report; he stated it as an actual fact. Granted, he was speaking in a public service announcement, where footnotes and caveats are generally not used. If he was trying to get people\u2019s attention, he certainly did. But by the same token, by citing as fact the results of a survey that may be overstated, the president runs the risk of undermining support for his efforts to call attention to sexual violence.", "lang": "en"}
