The word true in red, capital letters is emblazoned over the photo.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThere\u2019s nothing to it.\n\nThe post says a story circulating online claims that after Pelosi cursed at Republicans, House sergeant at arms Joe Barron forcibly removed her from the floor, and that 10 congressmen who were present confirmed the incident.\n\nThe sergeant at arms \u2014 the House\u2019s principal law enforcement official, charged with maintaining security on the floor and for the House side of the Capitol complex \u2014 is not Joe Barron. The person in that position, notable for shouting out an introduction of the president at the annual State of the Union address, has been Paul Irving, since 2012.\n\nInternet searches show that the post was originally published as satire on the website Busta Troll in April 2020.\n\nSince January 2019, we\u2019ve fact-checked similar Pelosi-drunk-in-public claims, rating them Pants on Fire, Pants on Fire, Pants on Fire and Pants on Fire.\n\nSame rating here: Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
