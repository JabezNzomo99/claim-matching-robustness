Rep. Chris Collins, a Trump supporter, turned the claim around on Hillary Clinton.\n\nDuring an interview on MSNBC, Collins made assertions about Clinton\u2019s views on the Constitution in the context of the Gold Star father\u2019s Democratic National Convention speech.\n\n\"He stood next to Hillary Clinton, who has already said she's going to wipe out the Second Amendment. She doesn't believe in the First Amendment. And, she also believes in big government, which flies in the face of the 10th Amendment.\" Collins said during the interview. \"That was absolutely hypocritical.\"\n\nCollins based his claims on a few of Clinton\u2019s positions. She has criticized the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision that deemed spending money to influence elections \"free speech\" that may not be limited. She supports gun control. Collins said he also believes Clinton will continue to issue executive orders similar to those by President Obama. His office says that practice violates the 10th Amendment.\n\nIs Collins right about Clinton\u2019s positions on the First, Second, and 10th Amendments?\n\nHillary Clinton does not agree with the Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 decision in Citizens United v. Federal Elections Commission.\n\nThe Supreme Court held in the case that restrictions could not be placed on how corporations spend money to influence an election. In the opinion of the court, since corporations have the same rights as individuals, they are also guaranteed free speech under the First Amendment.\n\nThat does not mean Clinton does not believe in the First Amendment. It means she, like many others, does not agree with the court\u2019s interpretation of the First Amendment in this case.\n\nThe Supreme Court has ruled the Second Amendment guarantees the right of citizens to bear arms. Clinton supports gun control policies that gun-rights advocates call contrary to its interpretation.\n\nClinton said in her speech to the Democratic National Convention that she was \"not here to repeal the Second Amendment.\" In an interview on ABC's 'This Week,' Clinton said, \"I believe we can have common-sense gun safety measures consistent with the Second Amendment.\"\n\nPolitiFact earlier this year rated as False Trump\u2019s claim that Clinton \"wants to abolish the 2nd Amendment.\n\nRepublicans have criticized President Barack Obama\u2019s use of executive orders to address issues Congress has not acted on. Clinton\u2019s campaign has said in the past she would consider using that power, too, if she cannot reach agreements with Congress. Collins calls that a slippery slope to violating the Constitution.\n\nThe 10th Amendment reinforces the idea of federalism. Some laws are decided at the state level while others are under federal control. We spoke to constitutional law experts Laurence Tribe from Harvard Law School and Matthew Steilen from the University at Buffalo about Collins' claim. In this case, they said executive actions and orders typically do not directly contradict the 10th Amendment.\n\nThe argument stems partly from Obama\u2019s actions on gun control earlier this year and immigration in 2014.\n\nExecutive actions are not new. George Washington even issued them. Obama has issued more than many presidents, but fewer than others. Ronald Reagan issued 381, while Obama issued 244 through July.\n\nIn an interview on MSNBC, Collins said Clinton is \"going to wipe out the Second Amendment. She doesn't believe in the First Amendment. And, she also believes in big government, which flies in the face of the 10th Amendment.\"\n\nClinton holds positions that contradict certain interpretations of those amendments, but Collins\u2019 claim is too broad.\n\nWe rate this claim as False.", "lang": "en"}
