Yet Trump used the 1.8 million figure to inaccurately claim at the rally: \u201cMore than 1.8 million deceased individuals right now are listed as voters. Oh, that\u2019s wonderful. Well, if they\u2019re going to vote for me, we\u2019ll think about it, right? But I have a feeling they\u2019re not going to vote for me. Of the 1.8 million, 1.8 million is voting for somebody else.\u201d\n\nMore than 1 billion ballots were cast from 2000 through 2014. There were 31 incidents of specific, credible allegations of voter impersonation at the polls, according to research by Loyola Law School professor Justin Levitt, who has been tracking such data for years. So the problem that Trump is warning his voters to watch for at the polls \u2014 to make sure things are \u201con the up and up\u201d \u2014 happens at the rate of 31 out of 1 billion ballots cast.\n\nTrump uses \u201cvoter fraud\u201d has become a catchall phrase for all voting irregularities. Confirmed instances of actual voter fraud do exist, but Trump makes a totally unsupported extrapolation of these isolated cases to say they are indicative of a widespread fraud in the U.S. election system. We wonder whether it ever occurred to Trump that \u201cnobody is talking about\u201d the \u201cbig, big problem\u201d of voter fraud because that \u201cbig, big\u201d problem doesn\u2019t exist. Trump earns Four Pinocchios.\n\n\u201cThen there\u2019s the issue of illegal immigrants voting. The following comes from a 2014 report from The Washington Post: \u2026 \u2018Non-citizen votes could have given Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health-care reform and many other reforms, and other Obama administration priorities.\u2019 Now, it continues: \u201cIt is \u2018possible that non-citizen votes were responsible for Obama\u2019s 2008 victory in North Carolina. Obama won the state\u2019 by 14,000 votes, so a turnout by 5.1 percent of North Carolina\u2019s adult citizens.\u2019\u201d\n\nStephen Ansolabehere, who creates and runs the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (used in the research by Richman and Earnest), and two other researchers offered the most thorough critique. They replicated the research by interviewing the same panel of respondents about their voting patterns in 2010 and 2012. They found that people had identified as a citizen one year, but noncitizen the next \u2014 indicating misclassification.\n\nThey concluded that all of the cases of noncitizen voting \u201care nearly certainly citizen voters who are misclassified as being non-citizens. Hence, their predicted vote rates of non-citizens in fact reflect the behavior of citizens.\u201d Because the citizen group is large compared with the noncitizen group in the survey, even a small classification error could be substantial, they found.\n\nRichman said Ansolabehere\u2019s critique was thoughtful and useful, and that he is working on a revision based on the concerns raised in the response. But Richman said his results are valid and rejected claims that his findings were entirely spurious. There were 10 people who twice answered they were noncitizens but had voted in 2012, Richman said.", "lang": "en"}
