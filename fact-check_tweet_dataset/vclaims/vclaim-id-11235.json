Doug Ducey talked fire safety at a press conference April 13.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s important to note that 90 percent of fires in Arizona are human-caused,\" Ducey said. \"Unattended campfires, discarded cigarettes, hot exhaust pipes, any source of extreme heat or spark can result in a Wallow or Rodeo-Chediski fire.\"\n\nGiven Arizona\u2019s vast land area, 113,594.08 square miles to be exact, we were curious as to whether nine out of every 10 fires in the state really are caused by humans and how that could be documented.\n\nDucey\u2019s spokesman, Daniel Scarpinato, provided us with Arizona State Forestry data that backs up the governor\u2019s claim on the surface.\n\nIn 2015, 352 out of 404 fires, more than 87 percent, were human-caused. Of the 304 fires reported this year, 296, more than 97 percent, were human-caused.\n\nThe State Forestry maintains a database of all fires, even if they don\u2019t respond to a blaze at first. State Forestry spokesman Bill Boyd said most fires historically are human-caused, even something as simple as parking a hot car over grass.\n\n\"If you look at it over the years, there is a large human component in there,\" Boyd said.\n\nBut there\u2019s a caveat here -- the data only includes fires on state and private land, not federal land. Ducey said \"in Arizona,\" which also includes federally-managed land. Almost 40 percent of the Grand Canyon State is federal land.\n\nMultiple agencies, including the U.S. Agriculture Department, U.S. Defense Department and U.S. Interior Department, have fire jurisdiction over certain areas of land.\n\nFor example, the U.S. Forest Service has fire jurisdiction over national forests and the Bureau of Indian Affairs does the same for tribal land.\n\n\"It is complex and coordinated at all levels, from local to national,\" said Mary Zabinski, spokeswoman for the Southwest Coordination Center, an interagency group of state and federal agencies.\n\nAll that coordination means we do have a total for the entire state for human-caused fires. According to the Southwest Coordination Center, for the entire state of Arizona -- state, private and federal land -- 61 percent of fires in 2015 were caused by humans, and 39 percent of fires were caused by lightning.\n\nHowever, U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Jennifer Jones notes that 90 percent of wildfires on all land nationwide are caused by humans.\n\n\"Typically, the majority of fires on land under the jurisdiction of state and local government agencies are human caused as those lands are closer to homes and roads,\" Jones said.\n\nDucey said that \"90 percent of fires in Arizona are human-caused.\" Ducey\u2019s claim is correct when referencing only state and private land. But he wasn\u2019t that specific.\n\nFires \"in Arizona\" includes federally-managed land, in addition to state and private land. And the percentage of human-caused fires on all those lands combined isn\u2019t 90 percent, it\u2019s 61 percent.\n\nSo Ducey has a point that human activity is contributing to wildfires, but the number he cites is a good bit off. On balance, we rate Ducey\u2019s claim Half True.", "lang": "en"}
