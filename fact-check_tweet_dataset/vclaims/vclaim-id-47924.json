For starters, Google does not write its own dictionary entries. The search engine provides links and information from reputable dictionaries, such as the one compiled by Oxford University Press. Second, Gingrich\u2019s complaint is based on an example sentence showing a derogatory use of the word \u201cparasite,\u201d and not an actual definition.\n\nWhen we searched for the term \u201cparasite definition\u201d on Google, we were provided the following definition: \u201can organism that lives in or on an organism of another species (its host) and benefits by deriving nutrients at the other\u2019s expense.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of this search result. A few things are worth noting. First, Google includes the words \u201cFrom Oxford\u201d at the bottom left of this image, indicating the source of the provided information. If you click on the words \u201cFrom Oxford\u201d while performing this search on Google, you will be redirected to Lexico.com, a collaboration between Dictionary.com and Oxford University Press (OUP).\n\nSecond, Google provides a usage example below its definitions:\n\nThe problematic portion of this definition, according to Gingrich, can be seen when the information box is expanded. Google provides a second definition for the term \u201cparasite\u201d but this time shows how the word can be used in a derogatory fashion.\n\nGoogle provides the definition here as \u201ca person who habitually relies on or exploits others and gives nothing in return.\u201d They also give an example sentence of how \u201cparasite\u201d can be used in this derogatory manner: \u201cThe capitalist is really a parasite on the workers.\u201d\n\nDanny Sullivan, Google\u2019s public search liaison, responded to Gingrich\u2019s complaint with some additional information. Sullivan explained the complaint was based on a usage example, not a definition, and that the information was taken from a third party, Lexico.com, and was not created by Google itself:\n\nIn sum, Google did provide an example sentence for the word \u201cparasite\u201d that showed how the term could be used in a derogatory fashion to describe a capitalist. However, this comparison was not made in the actual definition for the word (as alleged by Gingrich), nor was this example sentence written by Google.", "lang": "en"}
