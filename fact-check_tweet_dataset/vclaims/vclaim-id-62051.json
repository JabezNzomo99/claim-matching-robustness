Under the hands, what appears to be a \u201cPolice Evidence\u201d bag can be seen.\n\n\u201cMummified remains of a fairy have been discovered in the Derbyshire countryside,\u201d reads the caption.

The figurine was created for a 2007 April Fools\u2019 Day prank by U.K.-based artist Dan Baines. The creator of illusions for magicians, Baines said he crafted the fairy figure in the photo and made up the backstory about its discovery as a prank, according to BBC News.\n\nThe made-up backstory, which included multiple photos of the fairy, detailed how a man supposedly found the remains while walking his dog in Derbyshire and how forensic experts and anthropologists examined it. Baines clarified after a few days that the mummified fairy remains were a hoax in a statement on his website.\n\n\u201cEven if you believe in fairies, as I personally do, there will always have been an element of doubt in your mind that would suggest the remains are a hoax,\u201d Baines wrote. \u201cHowever, the magic created by the possibility of the fairy being real is something you will remember for the rest of your life. Alas the fairy is fake but my interest and belief has allowed me to create a work of art that is convincing and magical.\u201d\n\nHe went on to apologize for the prank, saying, \u201cI hope you have not been offended by the events of the past few days but if you are I sincerely apologise. It took 50 years for the Cottingley fairies to be revealed as a hoax; at least you\u2019ve only had to endure a few days of mystery.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
