And per a LinkedIn page connected to the Twitter account, Pierce is the founder of Pierce Bainbridge law firm and lives in the Los Angeles metro area. The law firm describes itself as a \u201cstate-of-the-art litigation law firm dedicated to the lost art of combat by trial,\u201d with past clients including U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.\n\nNext, we used the State Bar of California\u2019s database of attorneys to find out if Pierce had an active license to practice law in the state. He did, as of this report.\n\nAfter that, we sought evidence to determine whether he was among defending attorneys representing Rittenhouse, who faces charges including first-degree intentional homicide, which carries a life sentence. Snopes found reports from media outlets including Reuters, the Chicago Sun-Times, Business Insider, WISN 12-Milwaukee, and Fox News, that indeed named Pierce as an attorney fighting the teenager\u2019s charges.\n\n\u201cJohn Pierce told Reuters on Thursday that he and colleagues at Pierce Bainbridge would obtain justice for Kyle Rittenhouse \u2026\u201d\n\nAs more proof, Pierce said on Twitter that he was \u201ccoordinating a whole special forces team to HALO jump in\u201d regarding Rittenhouse\u2019s case. Based on that statement and the news reports, we deemed it accurate to call Pierce an attorney for the teenager.\n\nThen, we looked for evidence on Pierce\u2019s Twitter account of the alleged statement by him: \u201cKyle Rittenhouse will go down in American history alongside that brave unknown patriot at Lexington Green who fired \u2018The Shot Heard Round The World\u2019 on April 19, 1775. A Second American Revolution against Tyranny has begun #FightBack.\u201d\n\nNo such post existed, as of this report. However, a separate tweet in the early hours of Sept. 3 by Lin Wood, a prominent Atlanta attorney who was also on Rittenhouse\u2019s legal defense team, displayed a screenshot of the alleged statement by Pierce, word-for-word, as well as information about Twitter\u2019s terms of service that prohibit content that threatens, glorifies, or promotes violence.\n\n\u201cCensorship. Plain and simple,\u201d Wood wrote, suggesting the social media site wrongfully removed Pierce\u2019s comment that compared their client\u2019s actions to the start of the Revolutionary War.\n\nBy about noon the same day, Pierce said he was \u201cback from the Twitter penalty box\u201d and indicated that, yes, the platform had removed the in-question tweet. He also shared an article by a website called Reclaim The Net that dedicates itself to pushing \u201cback against big tech and media gatekeepers,\u201d which stated:\n\n\u201cTwitter locked the account of John Pierce, the lead defense lawyer for Kyle Rittenhouse, over a tweet comparing Rittenhouse to the \u2018unknown patriot\u2019 who fired the opening shot of the Battle of Concord on April 19th, 1775 that started the American Revolutionary War.\u201d\n\nBased on that activity on Pierce and Wood\u2019s Twitter accounts, as well as the fact that Pierce was part of Rittenhouse\u2019s legal defense team, we rate this claim correctly attributed; the attorney did say the teenager will \u201cgo down in history\u201d for starting a second American Revolutionary War.", "lang": "en"}
