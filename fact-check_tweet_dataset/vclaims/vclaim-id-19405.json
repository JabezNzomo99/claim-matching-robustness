The EU does not currently have any regulations we can find that specifically cover the sale of cabbages.\n\nIn fact, this is an old American urban legend that has been circulating for almost seventy years, and was originally nothing to do with the EU.\n\nThe claim that an organisation\u2019s cabbage regulations contain precisely \u201c26,911 words\u201d is a myth that dates back to 1951, several years before the European Economic Community (the forerunner of the European Union) was even created. That claim was originally about the USA\u2019s Office of Price Stabilization (OPS) during the Korean War, and was itself a variation on an even earlier claim that dates from 1943.\n\nThe claim has been repeatedly debunked by various media outlets over several decades, but still persists.\n\nThe history of the \u201cgreat cabbage hoax\u201d is explained in a 2010 academic paper by Gary Alan Fine and Barry O\u2019Neill, which drew on a 1965 study by Max Hall. There is a seed of truth in its history: the origin is thought to be a wire received in 1943 by the Office of Price Administration (the predecessor of the OPS during World War II), from a business organisation in Kansas, in response to the issuing of an over-wordy regulation about cabbage seeds:\n\nAlthough an exaggeration for comic effect, the wire\u2019s contents were subsequently reported as fact by Reader\u2019s Digest , and mentioned in the Senate that year. When the OPS was formed in 1951 during the Korean War, the legend was revived by various publications\u2014changing cabbage seed to cabbages generally, and increasing the word count tenfold, initially to a round 25,000, before settling on 26,911 (the seeming precision giving it an air of plausibility).\n\nThe myth continued to spread across the media throughout the 1950s, and was revived again in the late 1970s and 1980s as deregulation became a political topic; 1977 is also the first known instance of the target switching to Europe, with the famous US broadcaster Walter Cronkite ascribing it to European Common Market regulations about duck eggs.\n\nThroughout this time, the number of words has generally remained stable at 26,911 (with occasional variations), although the subject of the regulation is sometimes changed to duck eggs, caramel, foghorns or other items.\n\nIn recent years the myth has appeared in columns in both the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, and the version about duck eggs was mentioned in parliament twice in the 2000s.\n\nSo how does the EU regulate cabbages?\n\nWe have been unable to find any current EU regulations that apply specifically to cabbages; when the BBC covered the cabbage myth in 2016, they reached the same conclusion. (Cabbages are, of course, mentioned in plenty of regulations.)\n\nThree cabbage-related regulations did exist in the past: one from 1966 on \u201cquality standards for cabbages, brussels sprouts and ribbed celery\u201d; its successor from 1987 on \u201cquality standards for cabbages, Brussels sprouts, ribbed celery, spinach and plums\u201d, and one from 2006 governing the \u201cmarketing standard applicable to headed cabbages\u201d.\n\nAll three regulations have since been repealed. None of them was 26,911 words long\u2014in all three cases the word count of the text specifically dealing with cabbages was in the region of a thousand words.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the other word counts in the claim are all in roughly the right ballpark, although some of them seem a bit off to us. Many of them are for texts that have multiple different versions of varying lengths, though, so it\u2019s impossible to be precise.\n\nPythagoras\u2019 theorem is basically a formula, but a common sentence version comes out at 22 words (the claim says 24). The Lord\u2019s Prayer is claimed to have 66 words: the traditional Church of England version has 70; the Catholic version has 55. Archimedes principle, supposedly 67 words long according to the claim on Facebook, normally has twenty-something words depending which version of it you read, although it\u2019s not what Archimedes actually wrote. The Ten Commandments (supposedly 179 words) can have somewhere between 76 words and over 300 depending on which source you choose. The Declaration of Independence has between 1,320 words and 1,458, depending on exactly what you count (the claim puts it at 1,300).", "lang": "en"}
