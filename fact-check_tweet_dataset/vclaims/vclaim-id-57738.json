But experts say this method is only safe to remove ticks that have not yet bitten the skin and that it should not be used on pets, and health authorities recommend removing ticks with fine-tipped tweezers.\n\n\u201cWhoever suggested using lint rollers to take ticks off after a walk in the woods...you\u2019re a genius!\u201d reads the caption of a post from April 25, 2020.\n\nThe misleading post resurfaced as Spring weather increased the likelihood of people walking in areas where ticks are prevalent.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported that the number of counties with blacklegged ticks, which can transmit Lyme disease, \u201chas more than doubled over the past twenty years.\u201d The Canadian government also warned that \u201cpopulations of blacklegged ticks are spreading in eastern and central Canada.\u201d\n\nThoroughly checking one\u2019s body and that of a pet after walking in a tick-infested area is the best defense against the pests, but Dr. Katie Chow, a veterinarian and professor at Canada\u2019s University of Guelph, told AFP that the advice to use a lint roller would only work if the tick was still on a person\u2019s clothes and had yet to bite.\n\n\u201cIf the tick has bitten and it\u2019s attached, I would be concerned about using a lint roller,\u201d Chow, who works with the Canadian Lyme Disease Research Network, told AFP by email. \u201cA lint roller on an attached tick could lead to improper removal.\u201d\n\nThe official tick removal advice on the Health Canada website says: \"Using clean tweezers, grasp the head as close to the skin as possible and slowly pull straight out. Try not to twist or crush the tick.\"\n\nThe CDC also recommends using \u201cfine-tipped tweezers to grasp the tick as close to the skin\u2019s surface as possible. Pull upward with steady, even pressure.\u201d\n\nDogs are also very susceptible to tick bites, but Clow cautioned against using lint rollers on a pup.\n\n\u201cI would not recommend a lint roller to be used on an animal though to get the unattached ticks off. That could be painful,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Ian Sandler, a member of the National Issues Committee of the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association, also cautioned against using a lint roller to prevent a pet from catching a tick-borne disease.\n\n\u201cEven if you could remove a few ticks that haven\u2019t attached, it provides a false sense of security that you got all the ticks,\u201d he said.\n\nThe American Kennel Club recommends using \u201cfine point tweezers\u201d or a tick removal hook.\n\nDuring the 2019 tick season, AFP Fact Check reported on another misleading post about tick removal. Health officials cautioned against trying to remove a tick with a soap-soaked cotton ball.\n\nSimilarly, the CDC website says: \u201cAvoid folklore remedies such as \u2018painting\u2019 the tick with nail polish or petroleum jelly, or using heat to make the tick detach from the skin. Your goal is to remove the tick as quickly as possible -- do not wait for it to detach.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
