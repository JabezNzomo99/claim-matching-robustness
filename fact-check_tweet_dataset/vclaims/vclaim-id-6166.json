But he thinks that Labour should carry out \u201cwar game-type scenario planning\u201d in case it does happen.\n\nHe told a Labour Party conference event that people \u201cwant to know that we have got a response to anything that could happen\u201d, according to Sky News.\n\nAt the moment, McDonnell said, the \u201crelevant expertise\u201d is being brought together to carry out such plans.\n\nYet a Labour party spokesperson has since said that this is not official party practice.\n\n\"This was an exercise not done by us but by members\u201d, they told the BBC.\n\n\u201cThe scenarios were to deal with numerous events such as national disasters and acts of terror that could occur under any government.\"\n\nNonetheless, Jeremy Corbyn has spoken supportively of McDonnell\u2019s suggestions in a BBC interview.\n\n\"I think John is right to look at all these scenarios\" he said. \u201cIf we move into government we need to\u2026 look at all the scenarios we might face.\u201d\n\nSo Labour does not expect a run on the pound, but parts of the party are planning for it. And although scenario-planning is not official party practice, Mr Corbyn and Mr McDonnell are both supportive of it.", "lang": "en"}
