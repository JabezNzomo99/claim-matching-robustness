AmethiKiPragati,\u201d wrote Manipur Congress.\n\nThis tweet was made at 1:08 PM and soon after, General secretary and social media in-charge of Mahila Congress Chitra Sarwara also tweeted the same set of images. \u201c\u0915\u093e\u092e \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0939\u0948- @RahulGandhi \u092c\u0938 \u0928\u093e\u092e \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0939\u0948 -@narendramodi (Has done work \u2013 @RahulGandhi Has only promoted his name \u2013 @narendramodi),\u201d read her tweet.\n\nHimachal Congress and Uttarakhand Congress also tweeted the identical collage.\n\nUpon reverse-searching the images, Alt News found that the one on the bottom-right dates back to at least 2011. A website Water and Megacitieshad included the photograph in one of its articles on Varanasi, published on July 28, 2011. Twitter user Ankur Singh had pointed this out. The website is now unavailable although a Google search still throws up the article.\n\nWe also found that the image was used in an article about potholes published by Dainik Jagran in 2012.\n\nSince the photograph exists on the internet prior to 2014, it cannot be attributed to poor governance under the last 4.5 years of BJP\u2019s rule.\n\nThe other image used by Congress (top-right) is also an old picture, even though it does not date back prior to 2014. We found that the image is a screengrab of a video posted in American stock photo agency Shutterstockin 2015.\n\nCongress, therefore, used old images to target BJP by portraying that the party hasn\u2019t contributed to development initiatives in PM Modi\u2019s constituency, Varanasi, in the last 4.5 years. Earlier, BJP had used old images (1, 2,) to portray infrastructural projects completed under PM\u2019s Modi\u2019s tenure.", "lang": "en"}
