The post does not mention about any state and questions Modi for the increase in the number of such cases. So, the reference region is considered to be the whole country. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: In India, the number of reported rape cases increased from 1638 (in 2013) to 3051 (in 2018). Fact: According to the National Crime Records Bureau report, the number of reported rape cases in India in 2013 was 33707, not 1638. Also, the data is not available for the year 2018. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nThe National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) releases data on the number of rape cases reported in India. It has released the data only till 2017. The latest report (\u2018Crime in India \u2013 2017\u2019) was released in October 2019. So, the number of rapes cases registered in 2018 in India cannot be ascertained. \n\n\n\nAlso, according to the \u2018Crime in India \u2013 2013\u2019 report, in 2013, the number of reported rape cases in India was 33707, not 1638.\n\n\n\nThe number of reported rape cases in India in each year over the decade (2008-2017) can be seen in the below graph:\n\nA detailed article by Factly on the number of rapes reported and the conviction rate can be read here.\n\nTo sum it up, the number of reported rape cases in India in 2013 was 33707, not 1638. There is no NCRB data available for the year 2018. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
