The photo was actually taken at a homeless camp cleanup in Washington state in 2017.\n\nSocial media posts, amassing hundreds of thousands of shares on Facebook, show a huge pile of used hypodermic needles collected during a cleanup and misidentify the location as a site in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s congressional district.\n\nIn one post, the caption falsely states: \u201cThese needles were picked up at a city park in San Francisco while cleaning up a homeless camp. This is Nancy Pelosi\u2019s district! Don\u2019t let the Democrats have control of our country or your state will be next!\u201d Another post with a similar caption, also incorrectly attributing the scene to Pelosi\u2019s district, asks viewers to \u201c#pleasevoterepublican.\u201d\n\nThe photo is actually from a 2017 needle cleanup in Snohomish County, Washington. The Daily Herald, a newspaper covering Everett and Snohomish County, wrote about the cleanup more than two years ago when a group of recovering addicts participated in the event at a homeless camp. The newspaper confirmed that the photo in the recent social media posts was taken at the October 2017 event in the south Everett area.\n\nPelosi represents California\u2019s 12th congressional district in San Francisco, not Snohomish County, Washington. Moreover, in an email from Pelosi\u2019s office, her press secretary informed us that protocol for San Francisco\u2019s Recreation & Parks Department calls for used needles to be disposed in bio bins, not left loosely on a tarp, as it appears in the photo.\n\nLarge cities like San Francisco are frequently targeted in conservative social media posts for national problems such as homelessness and drug abuse. President Donald Trump himself often engages in the same behavior.\n\nLast October the president tweeted, \u201cI can\u2019t believe that Nancy Pelosi\u2019s District in San Francisco is in such horrible shape.\u201d The previous month he also attacked San Francisco and Los Angeles for the homelessness problem in those cities, though earlier that day Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson had rejected California\u2019s request for funding to fight the problem.\n\nThese are not partisan or local issues, but rather national problems. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, \u201cOpioid overdoses accounted for more than 42,000 deaths in 2016.\u201d The National Institute on Drug Abuse recently reported \u201cevery day, more than 130 people die in the United States after overdosing on Opioids.\u201d\n\nThe drug problem is indeed acute in Pelosi\u2019s district. Citing preliminary statistics from the city\u2019s medical examiner\u2019s office, the San Francisco Chronicle recently wrote that \u201cFentanyl and heroin overdoses in San Francisco more than doubled in 2019.\u201d\n\nHomelessness has also been a major issue in California and the city of San Francisco. HUD\u2019s 2019 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress said there are an estimated 567,715 homeless people in the United States, of which 151,278 \u2014 more than 26 percent \u2014 reside in California. San Francisco ranked sixth in the nation for the largest number of people experiencing homelessness in 2019, according to a Forbes report.\n\nThe opioid crisis has become a bipartisan issue with politicians working across the aisle on legislation to combat the epidemic. Over 30 states have enacted laws limiting opioid prescriptions, and the Opioid Crisis Response Act passed Congress in 2018 with bipartisan support and signed into law by Trump.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
