The claim is false; the video has been manipulated; the original video has circulated in media reports since at least 2015 about an incident involving a Texas mayor.\n\nThe one-minute, 32-second clip was published here on Facebook on March 15, 2020. It has been viewed more than 8,200 times.\n\nThe post\u2019s Indonesian-language caption translates to English as: \u201cDonald Trump left the meeting room to go to the toilet to defecate, but ...he forgot to turn off the microphone on its tie so his fart can be heard from the meeting room's speaker....\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nDonald Trump is the current president of the United States.\n\nThe video also appeared with a similar claim on Facebook here, here and here, where it has been viewed more than 3,600 times; on Twitter here and here; and on YouTube here.\n\nThe video was also shared in Malaysian language here, here and here; and in English here and here with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the video has been manipulated; the original video actually shows a city council meeting in Texas in 2015 that was interrupted after the local mayor took a toilet break.\n\nA Google reverse image followed by a subsequent keyword search found the original video published by American media New York Daily News here on YouTube on May 4, 2015, titled: \u201cTexas mayor leaves mic on during bathroom break.\u201d\n\nThe caption of the two-minute, 16-second video reads: \u201cA Texas city council meeting was interrupted after the city\u2019s mayor took a bathroom break - but left his microphone still switched on.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison between footage in the misleading post (L) and the New York Daily News video (R):\n\nFrom the 44-second mark to the one-minute 27-second mark of the video, the mayor can be heard urinating and flushing the toilet.\n\nIn the misleading video, however, the audio was changed to include a farting sound.\n\nUS-based news site Time published a report about the meeting here on May 4, 2015, headlined: \u201cSee the Hilarious Moment When a Mayor Leaves His Mic on During a Bathroom Break.\u201d\n\nThe repor'ts first two paragraphs read: \u201cEverything about this April 28 city council meeting in Georgetown, Texas, sounded completely civilized and serious \u2014 until the mayor forgot to turn off his mic when he went to the bathroom.\n\n\u201cIt all starts when Mayor Dale Ross gets up from his seat at the beginning of this clip from the live-stream of the meeting. Thirty seconds later, as Mayor Pro Tem Rachael Jonrowe talks about friends and family members who have contracted antibiotic-resistant infectious diseases, the man can be heard urinating and then flushing afterward.\u201d\n\nAustin American-Statesman, a Texas-based newspaper, interviewed Ross about the incident and published this article dated September 24, 2016, headlined: \u201cGeorgetown mayor: I\u2019m not embarrassed about bathroom video.\u201d\n\nThe manipulated video was previously also shared on Twitter on February 15, 2020, here, with a claim about a Texas mayor who forgot to switch off his microphone. The post, as reported by The Washington Post, was later retweeted by Trump.", "lang": "en"}
