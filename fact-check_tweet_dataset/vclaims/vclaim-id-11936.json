No, that's not true: the story was published by the latest in a long string of websites pretending to be official U.S. news outlets but which only push made up stories to earn money through advertising. The story is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Fox News 15 (not the real Fox News) on December 18, 2018 titled \"Rainbow City, AL: Routine traffic stop ends with officers finding dead lover's hand in man's anus\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nHighway patrol officers in Rainbow City, Alabama have made an unusual discovery during a routine traffic stop: A 33-year old man was pulled over and ended up confessing to having his dead lover's preserved hand stuffed inside his anus. Officers noticed a vehicle with a damaged tail light early yesterday morning, but were not prepared for what was to follow after they pulled over the driver. Upon approaching the vehicle, they observed that the single male occupant was exhibiting signs of nervousness. \"He was sweating profusely and grinding his teeth together,\" said one of the officers who made the discovery. \"I asked him to step out of the vehicle and place his hands on the roof. Instead, he told me he would have to first remove something from his ass that was very suspicious.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nHowever the website was only registered a few weeks ago and has nothing to do with the real Fox News:\n\nAlmost the exact same story (but with a bag of d*cks instead of a hand) appeared on a different site in the network earlier this week:\n\nThe site is part of a larger network of sites all designed to look like news sites from real U.S. news and entertainment brands. Older sites we identified as being part of this network include:\n\nThe current site shares several advertising network ID codes with other sites in this network.\n\nStories published by the network are often copied or inspired by older hoaxes from other satire or fake news sites but the quality of the writing is usually markedly better. The setting of the events is often some small town somewhere in the United States and in many cases the main illustration used is a picture found on the internet showing a police car from the local police force or a sign with the town's name on it. The same story is often re-used by changing the location and/or names of the people involved.\n\nWe wrote about foxnews15.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Butcher NOT Charged With Putting Cheating Wife in Meat Grinder, Feeding Remains to Cat", "lang": "en"}
