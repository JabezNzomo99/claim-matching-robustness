As a joke, the Supreme Court nominee wrote that he founded the nonexistent club, according to his former student government adviser.\n\n\u201cThe club never existed,\u201dsaid Stephen Ochs, a history teacher who also advised Gorsuch as a member of the student government. Ochs told us that Gorsuch listed the club in his yearbook profile as \u201can inside joke\u201d between himself and some of his liberal classmates.\n\nDozens of readers have asked us if Gorsuch, the federal appellate judge whom President Donald Trump nominated to the Supreme Court on Jan. 31, was indeed the leader of a fascist student group at the Jesuit high school in Bethesda, Maryland. He wasn\u2019t.\n\nIn an email to FactCheck.org, Patrick Coyle, the school\u2019s marketing and communications director, wrote that \u201cno such club ever existed on Georgetown Prep\u2019s campus.\u201d\n\nYet in an \u201cexclusive,\u201d the U.K.\u2019s DailyMail.com reported on Feb. 1 that \u201cSupreme Court Justice nominee Neil Gorsuch founded and led a student group called the \u2018Fascism Forever Club\u2019 at his elite high school.\u201d The story was based on an entry in the yearbook in which Gorsuch listed \u201cFascism Forever Club (Founder and President)\u201d among his high school activities.\n\nBut the club mention was not meant to be taken seriously, as Michael O\u2019Loughlin reported for America, a Jesuit magazine, a day after the DailyMail.com story appeared online.\n\nAmerica, Feb. 2: Political differences aside, Mr. Gorsuch was popular and respected, excelling at debate and being elected student body president. When it came time to write his senior biography for the yearbook, he would make light of the divide between his conservative political beliefs and those of the more liberal faculty and students. He wrote that he founded and led the \u201cFascism Forever Club,\u201d though those with knowledge of the school back in the 1980s say there was no such club. The mention of it in the yearbook was a tongue-in-cheek attempt to poke fun at liberal peers who teased him about his fierce conservatism. It was \u201ca total joke,\u201d said Steve Ochs, a history teacher at Georgetown Prep who was the student government advisor during Mr. Gorsuch\u2019s junior and senior years at the Bethesda, Md., school. \u201cThere was no club at a Jesuit school about young fascists,\u201d he told America. \u201cThe students would create fictitious clubs; they would have fictitious activities. They were all inside jokes on their senior pages.\u201d\n\nWe confirmed what Ochs told the magazine when we interviewed him by phone.\n\nOchs recalled that some classmates playfully called Gorsuch, whose mother worked in President Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration, a \u201cconservative fascist.\u201d That\u2019s what motivated him to put it in the yearbook, Ochs explained. He said that it was common at the time for students to make up clubs and activities for their senior pages.\n\nThe yearbook, Ochs said, also included an introductory message before the section for seniors that made another reference to the nonexistent fascism club. It reads, in part: \u201cIn political circles, our tireless President Gorsuch\u2019s \u2018Fascism Forever\u2019 forum happily jerked its knees against the increasingly \u2018left-wing\u2019 tendencies of the faculty.\u201d\n\nThat, too, was written in \u201cmock seriousness\u201d on behalf of the senior class, Ochs said.\n\nO\u2019Loughlin, Michael. \u201cNo, Neil Gorsuch did not start a \u2018Fascism Forever\u2019 club at his Jesuit high school.\u201d America. 2 Feb 2017.\n\nGoodman, Alana. \u201cEXCLUSIVE: Trump\u2019s Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch founded and led club called \u2018Fascism Forever\u2019 against liberal faculty at his elite all-boys DC prep school.\u201d DailyMail.com. 1 Feb 2017.", "lang": "en"}
