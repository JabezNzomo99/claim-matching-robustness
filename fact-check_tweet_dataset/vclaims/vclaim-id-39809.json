The video is being presented in a misleading context; the footage is actually spliced clips of president Rodrigo Duterte and broadcaster Ben Tulfo ranting against the network. The network\u2019s franchise is due to expire in 2020 but as of September 2019, there were multiple bills pending in the Philippine Congress to renew it.\n\nThis 10-minute 44-second video was published on YouTube here on June 22, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe video\u2019s Tagalog language title translates to English as: \u201cConfirmed!!! ABS-CBN To Close Down!\u201d\n\nA Tagalog speaking journalist in AFP\u2019s Manila bureau analysed the video. The content of the video does not bear out the claim in the title.\n\nIt contains four clips showing tirades against ABS-CBN by Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte and broadcaster Ben Tulfo.\n\nThe first clip, between the 0:00 mark and the 1:23 mark, shows Duterte saying \u201cyes\u201d when asked if he is going to block ABS-CBN\u2019s franchise renewal; it has been taken from this Rappler video published on YouTube on April 27, 2017 with the caption, \u201cDuterte to block renewal of ABS-CBN franchise.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the misleading video (L) and the Rappler video (R):\n\nThe second clip, between the 1:24 mark and the 2:36 mark, shows Tulfo talking about allegations ABS-CBN owners have unpaid debt to the government; it is from an August 6, 2018 episode of Tulfo\u2019s show Bitag.\n\nThe third clip, between the 2:37 mark and the 8:30 mark, shows Duterte saying he would \u201cobject\u201d to ABS-CBN\u2019s franchise renewal; it is from the state-run RTVM showing a November 8, 2018 Duterte speech in Boracay Island in Central Philippines.\n\nFinally, the fourth clip, which appears between the 8:31 mark and the 10:44 mark, shows Duterte again saying he will \u201coppose\u201d the franchise renewal; it is from RTVM showing a media interview also in Boracay on November 8, 2018.\n\nAFP has previously fact-checked an online report falsely claiming Philippine legislators have decided not to renew ABS-CBN\u2019s franchise.\n\nBroadcast networks in the Philippines need a congressional franchise in the form of a law to be able to operate, as highlighted in this document published by global legal information resource Getting the Deal Through on page 366.\n\nThere are several bills to renew ABS-CBN\u2019s franchise pending in the Philippine Congress as of September 2019, including here, here, here, here, here, here and here.\n\nThe network\u2019s franchise expires in 2020 according to this press statement.\n\nDuterte has threatened to block the network\u2019s franchise renewal as reported here by ABS-CBN on November 8, 2018.", "lang": "en"}
