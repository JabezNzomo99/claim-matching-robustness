Rich people are rich because they are superior.\u201d\n\nThe graphic says its source is one of Mr Cummings\u2019 essays, entitled \u2018Some thoughts on Education and Political priorities\u2019, which he published while he was an adviser to then-Education Secretary Michael Gove.\n\nThe words in the viral post are not a quote from that 237 page essay. The phrase doesn\u2019t appear anywhere on his blog either.\n\nPart of the essay, which was published in 2013, discusses genetics and social mobility, which was picked up by the Guardian at the time, and mentioned in a Guardian opinion piece by Polly Toynbee. She quoted part of the essay in her article, which said: \u201cMost of those who now dominate discussions of issues such as \u2018social mobility\u2019 entirely ignore genetics and therefore their arguments are at best misleading and often worthless.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
