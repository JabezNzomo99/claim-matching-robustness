According to the caption, the photo was taken last year at a detention facility, presumably at the southern border. The post circulated again this past week after congressional Democrats toured two government facilities in Texas.\n\nThe picture does not, however, depict a child held in one of these facilities. It actually shows a still from the 20th Century Fox movie \u201cDeadpool 2,\u201d starring Ryan Reynolds as the titular Marvel Comics character. Sixteen-year-old actor Julian Dennison, who appears in the viral image, plays a mutant teenager with pyrokinesis in the film.

A reverse image search also turns up similar stills from the movie.\n\nThe Trump administration has come under fire recently for reports of poor conditions, including overcrowding and a lack of toiletries, at some of its holding facilities. President Donald Trump signed a bill Monday granting $4.6 billion in humanitarian aid to help the federal government deal with the influx of migrants at the southern border.", "lang": "en"}
