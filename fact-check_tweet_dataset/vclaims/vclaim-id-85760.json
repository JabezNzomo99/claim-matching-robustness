In particular, they noted that he mentioned property that he owns in the state and yet complained \u201cthe taxes are way, way out of whack \u2026 double and triple what they should be.\u201d\n\nOne reader even compared the property taxes levied on his homes with equivalent homes in Chicago and New York. \u201cDue to Proposition 13, we have some of the most reasonable property tax rates in the country,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI would love to compare our property taxes on the land he owns here compared to a similar market value property in New York or some other state on the East Coast. I\u2019m originally from Chicago and I know high property taxes.\u201d\n\nHe said that on one of his homes, in Claremont, Calif., with a value of $542,584, he pays about $2,492 in taxes a year, compared with $7,528 for an equivalent home in Chicago, according to Zillow. His other home, which is in Winchester, Calif., and is valued at $421,866, has taxes of $4,493, compared with $10,412 for one of equivalent value in Westbury, N.Y.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear from the president\u2019s remarks whether he is talking only about property taxes or taxes overall. (White House officials say he was not.) He knocks Brown \u2014 who raised taxes \u2014 for doing a \u201cvery poor job,\u201d but the governor actually has been lauded for turning around the state\u2019s fiscal condition. The state had a $27 billion budget deficit when Brown took office eight years ago and is now on track for a $6 billion surplus.\n\nEven today, after adjustments over the years, California has relatively low property taxes. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation, which leans to the right, says mean effective property taxes for owner-occupied housing shows the state ranks 34th in the nation, well behind New York, which ranked 11th.\n\nWhite House officials, however, say Trump was not referring to property taxes but income taxes. An article in Forbes magazine highlighted California\u2019s recent increase in its top income tax rate to 13.3 percent, making it the highest in the nation and suggested that it could lead people to leave for lower-taxed states.\n\nThis marginal rate applies only to incomes over $1 million. California has one of the most progressive tax systems in the country, with incomes below $30,000 facing marginal tax rates of between 1 and 6 percent. The Tax Foundation ranks California as the most progressive tax system in the United States \u2014 and even more progressive than any nation in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, including France or Portugal.\n\nMoreover, we should note that while New York state\u2019s top income tax rate is 8.82 percent, New York City adds 3.876 percent to it, for a total of almost 12.7 percent. So California\u2019s rate should not seem so out of line for a wealthy Manhattan resident like Trump.\n\nThe Tax Foundation also says that California is one of the worst states in the country \u2014 48th \u2014 in terms of the business tax climate. While the state does well on property and unemployment taxes, its overall rank is dragged down by the high marginal income tax rates.\n\nThere is a proposal in the state assembly to boost the corporate income tax rate to 18.84 percent, up from 8.84 percent, to make up lost revenue from Trump\u2019s tax-cut bill. The proposed rate would be three times the median rate of other states, but it is given little chance of passage.\n\nThe president claimed that \u201ceverybody that lives in California\u201d knows their taxes are too high. Readers beg to differ, especially when it comes to property taxes. When we first saw Trump\u2019s remarks, we were inclined to agree that he was talking about property taxes, given the context. But White House officials say he was talking about income tax rates; he mentioned his properties to indicate being knowledgeable about the state.\n\nTrump\u2019s imprecise language makes it difficult to reach a firm conclusion. California has the highest marginal income tax rate \u2014 within a very progressive system \u2014 but among the lowest property tax burdens. In other tax areas, it is not the worst, as Trump suggests. So we will leave this at Two Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
