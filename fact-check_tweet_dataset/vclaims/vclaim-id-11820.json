The 140 households whose top-up payments ceased in the past year is four times more than the 35 households in the previous year. Also, we do not know the current status of the 175 households whose top-up payments have ceased. As of 30/9/2018, there are 32,378 households who are receiving the supplementary payments.\n\nOn 1 December 2018, the Irish News reported that \u201cthe number of homes in Northern Ireland hit by the \u2018bedroom tax\u2019 has increased fivefold in the past year\u201d.\n\nWhat is the \u201cbedroom tax\u201d?\n\nThe Social Sector Size Criteria, otherwise known as the \u201cbedroom tax\u201d, can reduce the amount of the benefit that someone receives to help pay their rent. The bedroom tax \u201cis a reduction in Housing Benefit or Universal Credit for people who live in a property that is owned by NIHE or a housing association and that is too large for their household\u201d.\n\nThe \u201ctax\u201d was first introduced by the UK government as part of its 2012 welfare reform and came into force from 1 April 2013 in Great Britain. The Housing Benefit (Amendment) Regulations 2012 determines size criteria to assess whether a housing benefit claimant is under-occupying his or her accommodation. The size criteria allow only one bedroom per\n\u2022 Person over the age of 10\n\u2022 Two children (under 16) of the same sex\n\u2022 Two children who are under the age of 10\n\nA household is under-occupied when it contains more bedrooms than the size criteria allows. This means that, if you live in a council or housing association home, your housing benefits will be reduced according to the number of spare bedrooms:\n\u2022 by 14% where under-occupying by one bedroom\n\u2022 by 25% where under-occupying by two or more bedrooms\n\nThere are also special circumstances where extra bedrooms may be permitted.\n\nThe introduction of the bedroom tax in Northern Ireland is laid out in The Housing Benefit (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2016.\n\nThe original commencement date for the regulations was postponed from 23 January to 20 February 2017, so it coincided with the introduction of new regulations that provide \u201cfor welfare supplementary payments to mitigate the impact on calculations of housing benefit of the social sector size criteria\u201d.\n\nThe new regulations mean that claimants affected by the bedroom tax will get a supplementary payment that equals their loss of housing benefit. The top-up payments are made to the tenant, or directly to the landlord, depending on who receives the original housing benefits. The mitigation measurements will remain in force until March 2020.\n\nThe regulations make an exception where people will stop receiving top-up payments if all of the following three conditions apply:\n\u2022 if you move to another property owned by the Housing Executive or a housing association and\n\u2022 the new property has the same number of bedrooms or more bedrooms than the one you are leaving and\n\u2022 you do not have management transfer status.\n\nThe Irish News article reports that now 175 households \u201care no longer receiving\u201d the top-up payments, \u201cfive times more than the 35 affected at the same point last year\u201d. (This should read either \u201cfour times more\u201d or \u201cfive times as many\u201d.) The Department for Communities in Northern Ireland published three reports on three time periods which \u201cdetail the number of Welfare Supplementary Payments that stopped when customers moved properties and continued to under-occupy by at least the same number of bedrooms\u201d.\n\nThe latest report states that \u201cduring the period 1 April 2018 to 30 September 2018 a total of 54 Welfare Supplementary Payments came to an end\u201d. In the previous six months, 86 payments came to an end, and in the period 1 April to 30 September 2017 a total of 35 payments ceased. The sum of these figures if 175 (see summary table below).\n\nWhile it is accurate to say that 175 households stopped receiving the top-up payment, this does not mean that there are currently 175 households who are in under-occupying properties. As the Department for Communities explained to FactCheckNI: \u201cSome of the households who have had mitigation ended may have since:\n\nFurthermore, \u201cThe Department does not routinely monitor the ongoing Housing Benefit status\u201d of those households who have their top-up payment stopped.\n\nAs mentioned, the top-up mitigation scheme expires in March 2020. In the Irish News article, SDLP Deputy Leader, Nichola Mallon, said, \u201cCome 2020, 34,000 households will be hit by the bedroom tax\u2026\u201d According to the Department for Communities most recent report (ended 30/9/2018), there are 32,378 households receiving supplementary payments (less than the 34,114 households for the period ended 30/9/2017; see table below).\n\nAs reported in the Irish News, 175 households stopped receiving supplementary payments for under-occupying properties. However, we do not know the current status of these households, nor does the Department for Communities.\n\nAs of 30/9/2018, there are 32,378 households in Northern Ireland receiving the supplementary payment. This mitigation top-up scheme is scheduled to end in March 2020.\n\nFactCheckNI is Northern Ireland\u2019s first and only dedicated independent fact-checking service and a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network\u2019s Code of Principles.
