Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of a Chinese Engineer in Karachi beating a Pakistani driver for submitting a fake petrol bill. Fact: The tweet with the above claim was made recently from a satirical account. The video was found to be on the internet at least since 2016. News reports indicated that the video is related to an incident in Malaysia. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen we searched on social media with the text given in the post (\u2018Chinese Engineer in Karachi caught on video beating Pakistani driver for submitting fake petrol bill\u2019), the video was found to be first posted on Twitter. The user \u2018@TheZaiduLeaks\u2019 posted the video on \u201828 June 2020\u2019. The description in the profile of that account states that all the tweets from it are for \u2018fun and 100% fake\u2019.\n\nThe video was later shared by many social media users with the same claim and those posts can be seen here and here.\n\nTo know the exact context of the video, we ran the screenshots of the video through reverse image search and found many reports from Malaysian news websites that were published in November 2016. Those news reports can be seen here and here. In the video, the logo seen on the \u2018Yellow\u2019 t-shirt worn by a man is used in the \u2018BERSIH 5\u2019 rally held in 2016 by BERSIH2.0. The rally was held demanding institutional reforms for a New Malaysia. So, it can be concluded that the incident took place in Malaysia.\n\nTo sum it up, a 2016 video from Malaysia is shared with the false narrative \u2018Chinese Engineer in Karachi beating a Pakistani driver for submitting fake petrol bill\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
