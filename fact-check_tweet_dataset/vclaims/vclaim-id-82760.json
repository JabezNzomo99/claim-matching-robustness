Is this really the case?\n\nSince no one at The Fact Checker reads Farsi, we turned to our friends and fellow fact checkers at Majlis Monitor, which closely tracks the Iranian Parliament, known as the Majlis, and fact checks claims about it. The Majlis Monitor is an offshoot of ASL19, a Toronto-based research organization that seeks to help Iranian citizens circumvent Internet censorship and obtain information online. (ASL19 refers to Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Rights, which focuses on the right to freedom of opinion and expression.)\n\nWhile some of these resolutions have been cited as additional provisions, such as calling for the elimination of Israel\u2019s arsenal, Souzanchi and Lyth said the resolutions \u201care not law and need not be satisfied in order for Iran\u2019s government to have the legal authority to implement the JCPOA. We think that these resolutions are mainly an attempt for Majlis to carve out some relevance for itself on the nuclear file, especially when its own bill gives the Supreme National Security Council (a decision-making body headed by President Hassan Rouhani whose decisions require confirmation by the Supreme Leader) control over implementation of the nuclear deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reaction of many hardliners to Majlis\u2019 bill was one of lament; several said that Majlis had acted as a \u2018rubber stamp Parliament,\u2019\u201d said Souzanchi and Lyth. \u201cWe take this to be an indication that opponents of the JCPOA didn\u2019t get the more favorable deal that they wanted. The resolutions Majlis passed were fairly innocuous with respect to the nuclear deal itself.\u201d\n\nThe resolution on Israel, for instance, \u201ccalls on Iran\u2019s government to use legal, political, and \u2018international\u2019 means to bring Israel into a broader Middle Eastern weapons of mass destruction free zone; it does not require the parties to the JCPOA to eliminate Israel\u2019s nuclear weapons. Other resolutions call on the government to use unfrozen assets to stimulate economic growth, and to only implement the JCPOA if the West lifts sanctions.\u201d (Here is a link to their full analysis.)\n\nIndeed, the Majlis Monitor\u2019s report on the vote noted that MPs were upset that the voting process took only 20 minutes and that Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani \u201cwas accused of pushing the vote forward and not allowing members of the parliament to give amendments and recommendations.\u201d The report said that hardline MPS were critical, with Hamid Rasaei quoted as saying, \u201cAli Larijani today, in less than 20 minutes, pushed the approval of a bill that implicitly approves the nuclear deal. He did not allow any proposals other than three proposals to his liking, and did not allow any discussions about favoring or opposing recommendations.\u201d\n\nKahyan, a hardline newspaper, was also critical of the parliament\u2019s \u201c15-minute decision for 15 years,\u201d the length of the agreement: \u201cWhile the members of Parliament had approximately 200 recommendations for the modification of the implementation of the nuclear deal, in an illegal act without reviewing these recommendations, the most important foreign policy file of the country was closed in parliament in 15 minutes.\u201d\n\nUpdate: Yigal Carmon, president of MEMRI, disputed this analysis. \u201cWe titled the resolutions of the Majlis \u2018an amended version\u2019 because it was not the original JCPOA text, rather Iranian demands that were added to it. No one can call that Majlis resolution an approval of the JCPOA. Majlis speaker Larijani himself said that and so did others, see for example our MEMRI TV report on Iranian Guardian Council Secretary-General Ahmad Jannati,\u201d he said in an email.\n\nWith respect to Carmon\u2019s assertion that we are confused about the nine resolutions in Majlis\u2019 approval bill, I would direct Carmon to MEMRI\u2019s own translation of the Supreme Leader\u2019s letter approving the JCPOA, in which Khamanei refers to \u201cThe nine-point provisions entailed in the recent bill adopted by the Majlis.\u201d See also this additional source that takes MEMRI\u2019s same mistaken interpretation of Majlis\u2019 bill, but yet still refers to \u201cMajlis\u2019s 9-point text.\u201d On the statements from Larijani and Jannati, it\u2019s important to put them in context, and to not selectively interpret them, as I believe MEMRI has done. Jannati is a hardline conservative, the longest-serving member of Iran\u2019s Guardian Council, and, as we have noted, for many hardline conservatives, the JCPOA is unacceptable. For many conservatives, speaking favourably in public about the JCPOA is a bit like a Republican speaking favourably about Obamacare. Larijani is also a conservative, albeit a more moderate one. They each want to be seen to be pursuing Iran\u2019s national interests, and to not pay the political cost of being seen as having sold out to the Western powers. There\u2019s also a political and religious consideration at work: Majlis\u2019 legislation (esp. foreign and defence legislation) and the decisions of the Supreme National Security Council do not go into effect if they do not have the approval of the Supreme Leader. In MEMRI\u2019s own rendering of Jannati\u2019s remarks, \u201cthe work of the Majlis pertains to the implementation of the JCPOA [my emphasis].\u201d As a hardline conservative, Jannati strongly believes in the structure of the regime, at the top of which sits the Supreme Leader \u2014 who alone has the final say on Majlis\u2019 legislation. This belief may be why he said that Majlis did not \u201capprove\u201d the JCPOA. Its legislation \u2014 its approval of the JCPOA \u2014 isn\u2019t valid if it does not have the Supreme Leader\u2019s agreement. With respect to Larijani, again, MEMRI reports him as saying that \u201cthe JCPOA was examined at various conferences, and we explicitly approved it in the Majlis.\u201d He does go on to say that Majlis did not approve the JCPOA \u201cin the way that the other side has said,\u201d but this does not mean that Majlis passed an amended version \u2014 amended in the sense that the other parties to the JCPOA are bound by Majlis\u2019 resolutions ( quoted here ). It does, however, mean that Majlis has a role in monitoring the domestic decisions Iran\u2019s Government makes in implementing the JCPOA.", "lang": "en"}
