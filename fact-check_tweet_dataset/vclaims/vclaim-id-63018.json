This is false; the image is of a cell tower in the US state of Arizona and was taken in 2009, almost a decade before 5G technology emerged.\n\n\u201cYes that is a 5G tower disguised as a cactus courtesy of the trump administration,\u201d one false post claims.\n\nA second search for the photo plus \u201cArizona,\u201d with results limited to January 1, 2000 to August 10, 2012, yields this article, which credits James S. Wood of the Arizona Daily Star for taking the photo in 2009.\n\n\u201cYes I took that photo,\u201d Wood confirmed in an email to AFP, noting that it was common practice for the state to disguise cell towers as Saguaro cactus and palm trees \u201cto make them more appealing.\u201d\n\n5G technology, which promises revolutionary internet speed and telecommunications, is also a source of controversy and conspiracy theories. It began to expand commercially worldwide in 2018, almost a decade after Wood\u2019s photo was posted online.\n\nSearching the Antenna Search portal, which maps cell tower installations in the United States, for Sunrise Drive in Tucson results in the record of a 34-foot structure on the street belonging to telephone company T-Mobile, registered in 2009.\n\n\u201cThis is a T-Mobile site,\u201d a company representative confirmed in an email. \u201cThere have been no upgrades on this site for a number of years, this photo is not current. The camouflage is to ensure compliance with the local permits specific to this site, it is not intended to \u2018hide\u2019 the cell site for any other purpose.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
