Experts have said such an agreement is unlikely.\u201d\n\nSince we wrote that article, Europe\u2019s lead Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said that in the event of a no deal Brexit, the EU would refuse to begin trade negotiations with the UK until the three main issues covered by the Withdrawal Agreement\u2014financial liabilities, citizens\u2019 rights, and the Ireland-UK border\u2014were settled.\n\nEU Trade Commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m has also said that the UK \u201cwill have to trade with us [the EU] and other countries, until there are trade agreements\u2014and we hope that will be a trade agreement\u2014on the \u2018most favoured nation\u2019 basis. And that will mean new tariffs.\u201d\n\nYou can read our full article on GATT Article 24 here.", "lang": "en"}
