A few images of Kejriwal with Imran Khan have gone viral with the claim that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief met the Pakistan Prime Minister just before the election.\n\nFacebook user \"Indra Pal Singh\" posted a set of four images on February 7, 2020, a day before the election, which is still being shared by many on Facebook. The user claimed in Hindi that at a time Prime Minister Narendra Modi is busy teaching Pakistan a lesson, Kejriwal is joining hands with India's enemies to win the election in Delhi.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The viral image is four years old. In 2016, Imran Khan had come to meet the Delhi chief minister at his residence in Civil Lines area. At that time, Khan was not elected the premier of Pakistan.\n\nTill the time of filing of this story, the post was shared over 200 times. The archived version can be seen here.\n\nUsing reverse search, we found that the viral image was published on multiple news websites in 2016. According to news reports published in The Indian Express and The Telegraph, Khan, the chief of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, came to Delhi and met CM Kejriwal at the latter's residence on March 20, 2016. Kejriwal had also tweeted about this meet on March 20, 2016.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that the viral post is misleading. These pictures of Imran Khan meeting Kejriwal are old and have no connection to the recently-concluded Delhi election.", "lang": "en"}
