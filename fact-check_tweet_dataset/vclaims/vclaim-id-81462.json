The video was in fact taken at Mexico's Benito Ju\u00e1rez International Airport in 2017.\n\nThe 26-second video shows a flooded tarmac with taxied planes and airport staff wading in shin deep waters around the planes. The logo of Air France is clearly visible on one of the tails of the aircraft. The footage started doing the rounds on Twitter with users claiming that it was the Mumbai airport that was flooded. It was also viral on WhatsApp.\n\nWhile many users refused to delete their tweets, some accounts deleted the video after others pointed out that it was not Mumbai.\n\nIncidentally the same video was incorrectly tweeted by the White House' social media director as Miami International Airport.\n\nThe clip was also viral last year in Bangalore with messages that it was the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) in the city only for KIA to issue a denial.\n\nThe clip can be found on YouTube as Houston airport after Hurrican Harvey, Hyderabad airport and Bangalore airport.\n\nThe video was shot on August 31, 2017 when the Benito Juarez International Airport in Mexico was shut down for over five hours due to heavy rainfall. A Spanish website had reported it with the video on the same day and the official twitter handle of the airport had tweeted about resuming services.\n\nIn addition, one of the planes seen in the video is that of Mexican carrier Interjet.\n\nLike Mumbai, flooding is a common occurrence in Mexico City during the monsoon season due to an inadequate drainage system that hasn\u2019t kept up with explosive population growth as well as garbage that blocks drains.", "lang": "en"}
