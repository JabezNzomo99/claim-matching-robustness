Rowling. But judging by the popularity of a video supposedly showing a trailer for a new Harry Potter movie that is set for release in 2020, plenty of people apparently still want to take one more trip to Hogwarts.\n\nOn Oct. 14, 2019, Facebook user M\u00e1rcia Farias posted a video entitled \u201cTRAILER HARRY POTTER 2020,\u201d which has racked up more than 20 million views since its initial posting:\n\nThis is not a genuine trailer for a new Harry Potter movie. This is a fan-made trailer that cuts together existing footage from old Harry Potter movies with clips of the actors (Danielle Ratcliffe, Rupert Gint, and Emma Watson) from other non-Harry Potter films.\n\nAt the 1:01 mark, for instance, Ratcliffe can be spotted in a hammock. This clip comes from the 2017 movie \u201cJungle,\u201d not a new Harry Potter movie. A few seconds earlier, viewers can glimpse actress Watson gazing up at the sky. Again, this footage was taken from an unrelated movie (in this case the 2017 movie \u201cThe Circle\u201c) and does not show footage from a new Harry Potter film. Likewise, the images of Grint in a tuxedo come from the Crackle show \u201cSnatch.\u201d\n\nThis is hardly the first time we\u2019ve covered false rumors about a new Harry Potter movie. In April 2018, a fake movie poster for a \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child\u201d movie was circulated on social media. We\u2019ve also previously addressed false rumors about a Harry Potter Netflix show and an eighth book in the series.\n\nAs of this writing, no official announcements have been made regarding a new Harry Potter film. However, fans will have a few more chances to visit this fictional universe. J.K. Rowling and Warner Bros. have produced a spin-off series called \u201cFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.\u201d Two movies in this series have already been released and three more are scheduled over the next few years. A stage play also was created called \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child.\u201d While it\u2019s possible that \u201cCurse Child\u201d will eventually gets a movie adaptation, Warner Bros. has made no announcements to that effect.", "lang": "en"}
