I hear the way she talks about Al Qaeda. Al Qaeda has killed many Americans. She said you can hold your chest out, you can \u2014 when I think of America, when I think of Al Qaeda I can hold my chest out.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I hear the hatred they have for Israel and the love they have for enemies like Al Qaeda, then you know what?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cA politician that hears somebody, where we\u2019re at war with Al Qaeda, and sees somebody talking about how great Al Qaeda is.\u201d Mr. Trump was referring to \u2014 and grossly distorting \u2014 remarks Ms. Omar made during a 2013 interview on a local PBS television show when she was a community activist. Nowhere in the interview does she proclaim \u201clove\u201d for Al Qaeda or \u201chow great\u201d the terrorist group is. In fact, Ms. Omar repeatedly noted that Al Qaeda and Al Shabab had committed \u201cevil\u201d acts and \u201catrocities\u201d and were \u201ctaking part in terror\u201d around the world.\n\nThe October 2013 interview on \u201cBelAhdan,\u201d a show about Middle Eastern community issues, focused on the pressures and stereotypes Arab-Americans face. Ms. Omar and Ahmed Tharwat, the host and producer of the show, discussed the attack on a Kenyan mall by Shabab militants that had occurred a month earlier. The two expressed frustration that Somalis and Arabs in general were asked to condemn or apologize for the attack because of an assumption, Ms. Omar said, that \u201cwe all are connected to this somehow.\u201d But, they added, the same is not asked of citizens in other parts of the world for violence perpetrated by governments or by members of their communities like the Iraq war or mass shootings. The \u201cyou can hold your chest out\u201d quote Mr. Trump cited inaccurately refers to an exchange about the language used to describe terrorist groups between Ms. Omar and Mr. Tharwat. \u201cIt\u2019s very interesting that we keep the Arabic names to such violent or negative entities: Al Qaeda, Al Shabab, Hezbollah. Have you thought about that? Can\u2019t you translate that?\u201d Mr. Tharwat said, commenting that their English-language equivalents are more benign-sounding phrases like \u201cthe base\u201d or \u201cparty of God.\u201d \u201cThey are polluting our language, our daily, casual languages,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think that is a product of the sensationalized media,\u201d Ms. Omar responded. \u201cYou have these sound bites and these words, and everybody says it with such intensity so it must mean or hold a bigger meaning.\u201d\n\nShe then described, while laughing, her experience taking a class about the ideology of terrorism in college and \u201cevery time the professor said Al Qaeda, he sort of like \u2014 his shoulders went up.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t say \u2018America\u2019 with an intensity,\u201d she said, commenting on what she believed the professor\u2019s body language was conveying in referring to Al Qaeda. \u201cYou don\u2019t say \u2018England\u2019 with an intensity. You don\u2019t say \u2018the army\u2019 with an intensity. But you say these names because you want that word to carry weight. You want it to leave something.\u201d Mr. Trump is not the first to take Ms. Omar\u2019s 2013 interview remarks out of context. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer, and officials for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, have previously shared social media posts accusing Ms. Omar of taking \u201cterrorism classes.\u201d Ms. Omar has criticized Saudi Arabia\u2019s royal family for its financial links to Al Qaeda. In congressional hearings, she has also expressed concerns that American weapons \u201cend up in the hands of terrorists\u201d used to carry out attacks in the Middle East and described a \u201chorrific reign of terror\u201d in Africa under Shabab and Boko Haram militants. Asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on Monday, Ms. Omar responded, \u201cI will not dignify it with an answer,\u201d adding that the president\u2019s claim was \u201cridiculous.\u201d She compared his comment to asking white people whether they \u201clove\u201d a gunman who is white. Mr. Trump also cited remarks Ms. Omar had made about the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks: \u201cWhen she talked about the World Trade Center being knocked down, \u2018some people.\u2019 You remember the famous \u2018some people.\u2019\u201d In a March speech made to the Council on American-Islamic Relations about discrimination against Muslims, Ms. Omar said the group \u201cwas founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.\u201d (The group was founded in 1994, and Ms. Omar\u2019s staff said she misspoke.)", "lang": "en"}
