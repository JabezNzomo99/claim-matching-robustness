The claim further says that the dead body of the girl was found in a Jungle in Delhi. The photo is created by combining two different images. The bigger photo shows an injured female lying fainted on the ground and the smaller one shows a young girl, posing in a formal dress. The post gives the impression that both girls are the same.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the photo in which a girl is lying on the ground is from Mexico. We couldn\u2019t find any detail of the other photo which is on the right.\n\nThe message with the viral picture says that a Muslim girl, who was the resident of Assam had secured 92% in class 10. She was the student of a college in Delhi University and was found raped and killed in a jungle in Delhi. The message also alerted people not to send their daughters to Delhi alone.\n\nThe post went viral on Twitter as well.\n\nWhen we reverse searched the image of the injured girl, we found an article of Daily Mail in which the viral photo was used. As per the article, the woman\u2019s name was Maria Santos Gorrostieta, who was the mayor of a town in Mexico. She was kidnapped and killed in November 2012 by a drug gang.\n\nWe also tried to find the information regarding the image on the right but couldn\u2019t get any detail of the same.\n\nWith all the possible keywords, we scanned the internet thoroughly but couldn\u2019t find any such incident of the rape case of Delhi in the news articles.\n\nWe also reached out to Delhi Police to authenticate the message added in the post. Delhi police PRO, ACP Anil Mittal clarified to India Today that no such incident has been reported in Delhi.\n\nAlso read: Fact Check: The truth behind a Tokyo restaurant serving human meat\n\nAlso read: Fact Check: Viral picture of Muslim man being heckled is not from India\n\nALSO WATCH| Did PM Modi spend Rs 80 lakh on make-up?", "lang": "en"}
