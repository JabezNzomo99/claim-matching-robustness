It turns out the answer isn\u2019t simple.\n\nEstimates from charities put the population of the camp at around 9,000, while the local authorities say it\u2019s around 7,000 people. Both agree at least that the camp\u2019s population has increased by around 50% since June.\n\nThe figure of 9,000 has been reported by a number of news outlets.\n\nCharities say there are around 9,100 people in the camp, including children\n\n9,106 migrants were living in the Calais camp at the beginning of August, according to a census conducted by the British and French charities Help Refugees and L\u2019Auberge des Migrants.\n\nWe spoke to Help Refugees which provided us with its figures. In June the charity put the number of migrants in the camp at 6,123.\n\nOfficial figures for the camp\u2019s population are lower\n\nLocal authorities claim that there were 6,901 migrants in the Calais camp on the 17th August, about a week after the charities\u2019 figures were collected.\n\nThere were 4,486 migrants in the camp in June, according to these estimates. This is the figure the Express has quoted.\n\nLocal authorities also point out that the number of migrants in the camp increased last summer too. By October 2015 there were around 6,000 people in the camp, but this had fallen to 3,700 by February.\n\nWhy do the counts differ?\n\nWe worked with our French factchecking counterparts, Lib\u00e9ration: D\u00e9sintox, who contacted the local authorities in Calais.\n\nThey were told that the authorities take an aerial photograph of the camp a few days before the count and divide it into grids.\n\nA team of 25 border police officers then checks the grids, going to each shelter and asking how many people live there, including anyone not present at the time. In August, the whole count lasted five hours.\n\nThe local authorities said they couldn\u2019t comment on why their figure is different from the number of people counted by the charities. They do say that their system of counting is \u201cprecise and exhaustive\u201d.\n\nHelp Refugees told us that its volunteers and translators go to each structure and ask how many people live there, making sure to visually count how many sleeping bags and beds are in each structure too. They also ask other questions about migrants\u2019 history, health and how long they\u2019ve been in Europe. They then mark the shelter so that it isn\u2019t counted twice.\n\nHelp Refugees described its system as \u201cthe most thorough estimate there is of the camp\u2019s population.\u201d It also suggested that its figure might be different from the local authorities because migrants in the camp were afraid to tell border police how many people lived in their shelter and were more prepared to tell the charities as they took longer to conduct their census.\n\nPart of the camp was dismantled\n\nIn February 2016 French courts granted authorities permission to dismantle an area of the camp where up to 1,000 migrants were thought to be living, according to the authorities. Other estimates put the figure at 3,500.\n\nThis was widely covered in the media at the time, along with reports of clashes between migrants, activists and the authorities.\n\nThe French government had provided alternative shelter for migrants in heated containers which housed 1,500 people and offered women and children accommodation in a separate centre. That said, MPs raised concerns about whether or not the new facilities would provide accommodation for all of the people who had lived in the demolished portion of the camp.\n\nThe UK and French governments have taken a number of steps since\n\nIn August 2015 the UK Home Office and its French counterpart issued a joint statement on the situation in Calais.\n\nThe agreement announced, among other things, that the two governments would step up their existing scheme of several monthly flights which return migrants from Calais to their home country.\n\nThe UK Border Force also works within the camp to provide information to migrants about life in the UK and what this can be like without the correct immigration status.\n\nThere is also a \u201cfast track [asylum] process\u201d in place which allows migrants to claim asylum in France and leave the camp.\n\n94 centres across France have been set up to provide emergency accommodation for migrants, whether or not they plan to claim asylum. According to the UN\u2019s Refugee Agency, 2,431 migrants went to one of these centres between October 2015 and February 2016.\n\nIn July, the UK government has also said that around 5,000 people have left the Calais camp and taken up the option of alternative accommodation and support from the French government since last autumn.\n\nWe\u2019ve written more about the migrants and asylum seekers travelling to the UK and Europe here.", "lang": "en"}
