Morgan Griffith has long blamed regulations by the Environmental Protection Agency for the decline of the coal industry across the nation and in his Southwest Virginia district.\n\nGriffith, R-9th, introduced to cut 15 percent of the EPA\u2019s budget, saying the agency has grown \"out of control.\"\n\n\"From 1972 until 2011, the number of EPA employees increased by 107 percent while the number of total federal personnel decreased by 15 percent,\" he on March 25 during testimony before the House Budget Committee.\n\nWe wondered whether Griffith\u2019s figures are correct. His spokeswoman, Andrea Pivarunas, sent us sources for the numbers.\n\nThe EPA had a staff of 8,358 in 1972 and it grew to 17,359 in 2011, according to data from the . That\u2019s an increase of 107.7 percent -- matching what Griffith said.\n\nWe should note that EPA dropped to 15,913 employees last year as many cashed in on an early retirement incentive offered to federal workers. So if Griffith had used the the most current data available, the increase since 1972 would have translated to 90.4 percent.\n\nThe of federal employees was 5.2 million in 1972 and 4.4 million in 2011, according to the federal Office of Personnel Management. That\u2019s a decrease of 15.4 percent -- again, what Griffith said.\n\nThe federal workforce figure requires elaboration because it includes civilians and uniformed military personnel, which have experienced different trends since 1972.\n\nExecutive branch civilian employees numbered 2.82 million in 1972 and 2.76 million in 2011, a drop of 2.1 percent. Meanwhile, uniformed military personnel numbered 2.36 million in 1972 and 1.58 million in 2011, a decrease of 33.1 percent. So the reduction in federal employees has more to do with a smaller fighting force than with a shrinking bureaucracy.\n\nNow, let\u2019s return to the EPA. What accounted for its sharp rise in employment? The answer is that the agency was barely out of infancy in 1972 when Griffith begins his timeline.\n\nThe EPA was created on Dec. 2, 1970, to consolidate environmental quality programs in several federal departments. For example, the Interior Department worked on water quality and pesticides, while the Department of Health, Education and Welfare worked on air pollution, and the Food and Drug Administration conducted pesticides research. In areas where the federal government didn\u2019t have oversight, state or local governments were left to fill in the gaps.\n\nCongress passed a number of laws in the 1970s that expanded the EPA\u2019s authority:\n\u2022 \u201cIf you look at the average teacher pay compared to the average pay of your citizens, Virginia ranks last.\u201d\n\u2022 Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention to to restrict lead-based paints in government-subsidized housing, cribs and toys\n\u2022 Clean Water Act to control discharges of pollution in surface water\n\u2022 Dumping Act to control dumping chemicals and material in the ocean waters\n\u2022 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act to control hazardous waste from creation to disposal\n\u2022 Toxic Substances Control Act to cut health risks from synthetic and organic chemicals\n\u2022 Superfund Act to identify those responsible for chemical contamination of land and compel them to clean up the contamination\n\n\"The 1970s is known as the environmental decade because so much happened so quickly,\" said Daniel Fiorino, director of American University\u2019s Center for Environmental Policy and a former EPA official.\n\nThe agency started with 4,084 employees in 1970 and grew to 13,078 in 1980.\n\nEmployment tapered in the early 1980s, but grew again in the 1990s with a sweeping expansion of the Clean Water Act and as concerns emerged about global warming. The EPA peaked in 1999, with 18,110 employees.\n\nFrom 1980 to 2011, employment at the EPA grew by 32.4 percent while the total number of federal employees -- military and civilian -- dropped by 11.3 percent.\n\nGriffith said, \"From 1972 until 2011, the number of EPA employees increased by 107 percent while the number of total federal personnel decreased by 15 percent.\"\n\nThere are a few minor issues with Griffith\u2019s choice of dates and numbers, but we won\u2019t quibble. The EPA increase would have dipped below 100 percent if Griffith had used the most current employment figures from 2013. On the other had, Griffith could have made the growth sound more dramatic if he had started his comparison in 1970, when the EPA was born.", "lang": "en"}
