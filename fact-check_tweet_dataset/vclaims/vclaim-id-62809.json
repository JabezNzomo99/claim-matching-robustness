No, that's not true: a screenshot with headline making that claim is bogus and was not really published by Brazil's Globo News.\n\nThe headline appeared in a viral image and it read \"Taylor Swift Says We Should Remove The Statue of Liberty\" above a subhead that read \"How can you have a monument to freedom that was built by slaves. Racist monuments make me sick.\" According to the screenshot the story was published \"By G1\" on \"18/06/2020 0h07\".\n\nAn example of the fake viral screenshot appeared in this Facebook post:\n\nThe screenshot looks like it is from g1.globo.com, a news website from Brazil. But that site does not publish articles in English and there appears to be no recent article on the site mentioning Taylor Swift and the Statue of Liberty.\n\nUsing Google Chrome's \"Inspect Element\" feature, Lead Stories was able to create a similar bogus screenshot in under five minutes by changing some text and removing some elements from a story about Taylor Swift that did actually appear on the site:\n\nSwift did speak out against Confederate monuments on Twitter recently, but she never mentioned the Statue of Liberty:\n\nLead Stories reached out to Swift's management for comment, this article will be updated when we hear from them.", "lang": "en"}
