At last count, about 15,000 employees in Missouri will receive one-time bonuses of about $1,000 or $1,500 each, according to various corporate announcements. She echoed other Democrats in saying that such bonuses were only a one-shot deal, and that higher wages are better. (Some companies have also said they would increase minimum wages.)\n\nWe thought this would be a good opportunity to demonstrate to readers whom the tax bill can be framed as good or bad for, depending on the perspective one uses. This tour through these charts and data will be a bit wonky, but we hope it will help illustrate why both sides pick and choose the data that helps make their case.\n\nSince there are far more people in the middle class, there are fewer dollars to share per taxpayer when the savings from a tax cut are divvied up. The nonpartisan Joint Committee of Taxation estimates that 572,000 taxpayers will file returns with an income category of more than $1 million, compared with more than 27 million in the $50,000 to $75,000 category and almost 70 million in the under $50,000 category. (Not to get too technical but these income categories generally are higher than a person\u2019s stated salary because the JCT uses an \u201cincome concept\u201d that includes employer contributions to health plans and Social Security as part of income, among other items.)\n\nThe Joint Tax Committee and the Tax Policy Center both have offered analysis of the impact of the tax cuts in the first year after enactment. We offer two examples below, which show the impact either by income or quintile category. In both cases, they show a benefit for the middle class, especially in terms of a percentage change in taxes. But the money for the middle class pales in comparison to the tax benefits for the wealthy.\n\n\u201cThe last way is the most relevant way to describe the situation, as it tells you about the person\u2019s overall welfare,\u201d Gale said. Edwards does not dispute this analysis, if one just wants to look at a person\u2019s welfare. But he says his approach makes more sense when examining the \u201cfairness\u201d or \u201cequity\u201d of the policy change \u2014 which in this case, he said, ended up making the U.S. tax system more progressive, at least initially.\n\nWith this framework in mind, let\u2019s look at McCaskill\u2019s statement: \u201cIt\u2019s a debt-inducing, make-rich-people-richer tax bill that in the long run is not going to be helpful to the vast majority of people in my state that are sitting around the kitchen table trying to figure out how [to] come out even at the end of the month.\u201d\n\nA state-by-state analysis produced by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a liberal-leaning group, show the vast majority will get some kind of tax cut in Missouri in 2019, but then as much of a third will experience tax increases in 2027. Even more striking is how even the tax cuts shrink. In the middle 20 percent of households, 90 percent would get an average tax cut of $830 in 2019 \u2014 compared to 60 percent getting an average tax cut of $100 in 2027, or about a quarter a day. (The ITEP calculation includes the impact of a variety of provisions, including repeal of the health mandate.) Below is a visual representation of the ITEP data produced by MSNBC.\n\nIn a nutshell, here\u2019s why the two parties appear to be talking about two different tax bills: Republicans focus on the immediate upfront tax cuts, which go to every income group, even if most of the money goes to the wealthy. Democrats focus on the ugly-looking distributional tables for 2027. Perhaps that\u2019s worthy of an asterisk, since Republicans are betting that the tax cuts will be extended \u2014 and Democrats such as McCaskill will not say whether they would actually refuse to extend them.\n\nMcCaskill, in her comment, focused on the \u201clong run\u201d and also on the impact of people sitting around a kitchen table, which denotes a change in after-tax income. Certainly, under the 2027 scenario, many taxpayers would receive very little. But at the same time, it\u2019s probably safe to assume that even a Democratic-led Congress and president in 2025 would seek to avoid tax increases on most Americans, even if they wanted to boost taxes on the wealthy.\n\nSo we face a conundrum. McCaskill framed her statement to reflect the findings of scorekeepers of the bill in 2027, even if the law was designed this way for budget reasons, not practical reality. Her staff says that means her statement is accurate. But in doing so, she ignores the more immediate impact of the law, which probably means noticeable tax cuts for her constituents for a number of years. So she\u2019s telling only half the story.", "lang": "en"}
