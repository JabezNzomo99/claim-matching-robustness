Bush's Cabinet in 2001 and later going to work for a Washington legal and lobbying firm.\n\n \n\n The Madison city clerk was not able to provide us a list of all elections that Thompson could have voted in. The office instead referred us to a list of elections kept by the Dane County clerk.\n\n \n\n Thompson\u2019s voting\n\n \n\n The Madison clerk did provide us with Thompson's voting record; we also checked it against the Wisconsin Government Accountabilty Board\u2019s searchable database. Both sets of records date back to the fall 2002 primary elections and they are identical, in terms of which elections Thompson voted in.\n\n \n\n Thompson campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir pointed out to us that the state board says its database for records from 2005 and earlier may not be complete. But board spokesman Reid Magney told us that doesn\u2019t relate to whether a person voted at all. Rather, some earlier records simply don\u2019t indicate whether a person who voted did so at the polls or by absentee ballot.\n\n \n\n Here are the elections Thompson did not vote in, along with some of the contested races that were on each ballot:\n\n \n\n 2003: February primary and April general -- state Supreme Court, Dane County circuit judge, Madison mayor. The April ballot also included statewide referendum on the right to hunt and fish.\n\n \n\n 2005: February primary -- state schools superintendent; April general -- schools superintendent and Dane County circuit judge. Also on the April ballot was a statewide referendum on four-year terms for certain county offices.\n\n \n\n 2006: February spring primary -- Madison Metropolitan School Board, Dane County Board of Supervisors; April spring general -- school board, Dane County circuit judge; November fall general -- governor (Democrat incumbent Jim Doyle defeated Republican Mark Green), U.S. senator (Democrat incumbent Herb Kohl defeating Republican Robert Lorge), state attorney general and others.\n\n \n\n 2010: February spring primary -- state court of appeals judge; April general -- appeals judge, county supervisor.\n\n \n\n 2012: May recall primary -- Gov. Scott Walker was opposed by protest candidate Arthur Kohl-Riggs.\n\n \n\n So, the records show that, since fall 2002, Thompson did not vote in 10 elections -- five primaries and five general elections in five different years.\n\n \n\n Asked to respond, Nemoir said in an email that Thompson \"makes all efforts to vote and the results provided by the (city) clerk do not take into consideration what was actually on the ballot in terms of contested elections and seemingly fail to represent his participation in the electoral process.\"\n\n \n\n But he offered no evidence of any inaccuracies in Thompson\u2019s voting record. And even if there is an error in the record -- say, for the 2006 general election for governor -- it\u2019s clear that Thompson skipped a number of elections over a number of years.\n\n \n\n Our rating\n\n \n\n Thompson said: \"I have voted every year in Wisconsin.\"\n\n \n\n Records show that since fall 2002, he missed voting in elections in five different years.\n\n \n\n We rate his statement False.\n\nAug. 13, 2012 -- a footnote: Folks who heard Thompson's claim might have thought he meant he had voted in every election. The record shows he did not vote in every election. And to be clear, he missed voting entirely in 2003 and 2005 (there were two statewide elections both years).", "lang": "en"}
