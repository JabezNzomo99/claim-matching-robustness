One image has a cartoon with Modi\u2019s face on it while the other image has a cartoon with Rahul\u2019s face on it. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claims made in these posts.\n\nThe archived version of the posts can be found here and here.\n\nClaim 1: Rahul on the cover of TIME magazine. The cartoon represents Rahul feeding Pakistan by giving donations to terrorist organizations. Fact: The image has been edited. The original cover has a lady cartoon which is replaced by Rahul\u2019s face in the post. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nClaim 2: Modi on the cover of TIME magazine. The cartoon represents Modi feeding Media with donations to keep them in line. Fact: The image has been edited. The original cover has a lady cartoon which is replaced by Modi\u2019s face in the post. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the images posted on Facebook are run through Google Reverse Image search, the original photo of the cartoon can be found in the search results. It can be seen that the original cartoon was drawn by Horsey in 2012 for the Los Angeles Times.\n\nAfter observing the photo, when searched for \u2018Time cover on corporate campaign donations\u2019\u2019 in Google, the original Los Angeles Time article can be found in the search results. It can be concluded that both the images being shared by several groups are fake and have been edited to serve their propaganda.\n\nFinally, the posts with feeding caricatures of Modi and Rahul on the TIME magazine cover are fake.", "lang": "en"}
