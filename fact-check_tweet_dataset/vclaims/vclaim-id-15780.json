Many do, including on a\n\nfor the photo of \u201cDr Gupta\u201d used in the post only returns results related to the post. And a search for \u201cDr. Guruprasad Reddy B V\u201d, again, only gives\n\nfrom the claim. Another search, for Osh State Medical University, does bring up a\n\nfor \u201cMaryland College of Medicine\u201d only returns results for the University of Maryland in Baltimore in the US. While the university was\n\nin 1807 as the Maryland College of Medicine, it was rechartered as the University of Maryland in 1812. The university has a\n\n\u201cThe idea that sugar is responsible for kick-starting or fuelling a cancer\u2019s growth is an oversimplification of some complicated biology,\u201d says an\n\n\u201cCancer cells usually grow quickly, multiplying at a fast rate, which takes a lot of energy. This means they need lots of glucose. Cancer cells also need lots of other nutrients too, such as amino acids and fats; it\u2019s not just sugar they crave.\u201d\n\nThe article adds that while it\u2019s sensible to avoid sugary foods as part of a healthy diet, there is no evidence that stopping all sugar intake will stop or prevent cancer.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s not that simple,\u201d it says.\n\nHealthy cells also need glucose, and \u201cthere\u2019s no way of telling our bodies to let healthy cells have the glucose they need, but not give it to cancer cells\u201d. It adds that there\u2019s \u201cno evidence\u201d that a sugar-free diet lowers the risk of cancer, or \u201cboosts the chances of surviving if you are diagnosed\u201d.\n\nThe post claims blending a whole lemon in a cup of hot water and drinking the mixture for one to three months would make cancer \u201cdisappear\u201d and that this \u201ccure\u201d was \u201c1,000 times better than chemotherapy\u201d.\n\nhave looked into this and found it to be false. So too has the US\n\n\u201cLemons are not a \u2018proven remedy against cancers of all types,\u2019 and no studies have ever been done that would compare the effectiveness of a lemon to chemotherapy,\u201d the centre\n\nof all previous research on the \u201canticancer potential of citrus juices and their extracts\u201d concluded that there wasn\u2019t enough data from clinical studies to support the claim that lemons prevent cancer.\n\n\u201cDespite the large body of evidence of pre-clinical studies showing citrus juices\u2019 anticancer effect, a current limitation for its antitumor employment is that clinical studies are only a few and their results were obtained through self-assessed tests on patients,\u201d the study says.\n\nby Cancer Research UK says that while citrus fruit do have important anti-cancer properties, there is no evidence they can cure cancer \u2013 as the\n\nThis is supported by a\n\n\u201cThe myth significantly exaggerates the potential of lemons and lemon juice as a cancer remedy,\u201d it says.\n\n\u201cThe beneficial compounds in lemon juice have shown promise in recent studies, but the levels found in foods may only enhance the body\u2019s ability to fight off cancer. In the end, there is no proven scientific replacement for radiation therapy or chemotherapy.\u201d\n\nThe post also claims that taking three spoonfuls of\n\norganic coconut oil, morning and night, would again make cancer \u201cdisappear\u201d.\n\nshow that virgin coconut oil can reduce the side effects of chemotherapy, and lauric acid \u2013 a component of coconut oil \u2013 has been\n\nto inhibit the growth colon cancer cells. But there is no evidence that coconut oil cures cancer.\n\nthat coconut oil is not a miracle food with magical cure-all properties.\n\n\u2018Statements in the claim not validated through research\u2019\n\nmade in the Facebook post. Dr Alfred Karagu, the institute\u2019s CEO, said the claims have never been proven.\n\n\u201cThe statements contained in the attached post have not been validated through any research. It's important to note that there are more than 200 known types of cancers whose causation is multifactorial,\u201d he told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore untrue to claim that abstaining from or consuming one product or the other is the solution to preventing cancer.\u201d\n\nin Nairobi, agreed. After reviewing the claims she labelled them as \u201cmyths\u201d and said there was currently insufficient evidence to prove any of them. -", "lang": "en"}
