{"title": "A Misleading Claim About Russia\u2019s Defense Spending", "subtitle": "It\u2019s no surprise that NATO\u2019s 29 countries collectively spend more on defense than Russia alone.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "December 06, 2019", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-34523", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-defense-spending/30312059.html", "vclaim": "On Dec. 4, the official Twitter account of the Russian Embassy in Canada tweeted:\n\nThere are glaring problems in this tweet, starting with the assertion that Russia\u2019s defense budget is $46 billion. That is correct, but misleading.\n\nThe figure is \u201cbasically the baseline defense budget at the current exchange rate,\u201d Mark Galeotti, a Senior Fellow at the Prague Institute of International Relations and an expert on Russian security issues, told Polygraph.info.\u201d It's not technically wrong but firstly understates the bang for buck, or rumble for ruble, the Russians get as they are also buying in rubles, not dollars. Also, there is about a trillion rubles in additional defense-related expenditure not in the defense budget.\u201d\n\nAccording to estimates by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Russia\u2019s military spending totaled $61 billion in 2018. (Although one expert -- Michael Kofman, Director of the Russia Studies Program at CNA Corporation, has estimated the real annual spending at roughly $150 billion in terms of Purchasing Power Parity) By comparison, NATO reports that its members budgeted a total of $1.04 trillion this year for defense. The obvious reason for this disparity is that Russia is a just a single country and NATO consists of 29 states, including some of the world\u2019s leading military powers. Two NATO members, the United States and France, are in the top five global military spenders. They account for $752 billion and $51 billion, respectively, in NATO member spending.\n\nThe embassy tweet also implied that a \u201cfake Russian threat\u201d has been manufactured to justify such high defense spending.\n\nThis ignores the fact that NATO has conducted military operations outside Eastern Europe, including Afghanistan (the International Security Assistance Force, 2003-2014, followed by the Resolute Support Mission, 2015). All 29 NATO countries have contributed to Operation Inherent Resolve against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\n\nRegarding actual Russian aggression, there is the 2014 annexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine, after which Russian forces invaded Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donbas region, parts of which remain under Russian occupation. Putin justified both actions in part by saying Moscow was \u201cprotecting Russian-speakers.\u201d In 2008 Russia went to war with Georgia over separatist territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\n\nSeveral NATO member countries \u2013 the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia \u2013 border Russia and have significant Russian-speaking populations. \n\n While the Baltic states have not yet faced a conventional military attack from Russia, they have been routinely targeted with state-sponsored disinformation. Estonia has been the target of coordinated cyberattacks believed to have been from Russia. In 2014, an Estonian security operative, Eston Kohver, was kidnapped by Russian special forces several kilometers inside Estonian territory.\n\nThe Russian embassy tweet includes a cartoon about wealth inequality, implying that NATO defense spending is responsible for this problem in NATO member-states. Wealth inequality is a global problem; in fact the U.S. and Russia are very close in this respect according to the World Inequality Database. A study by Moscow\u2019s Higher School of Economics, in cooperation with VTB Bank, found that the top 3 percent of Russia\u2019s population held almost 90 percent of the country\u2019s financial assets in 2018. Russia has fared worse than others in addressing this problem, according to a report from the charity organization Oxfam.", "lang": "en"}
