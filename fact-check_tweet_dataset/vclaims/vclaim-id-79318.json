It is being claimed that China is being punished for spreading coronavirus in the world. This video was received on the Fact-Checking WhatsApp bot (+91 9599299372) for fact-checking as well. Vishvas News in its fact-check found the claims to be false. An old video of Japan\u2019s Tsunami has been linked to the coronavirus pandemic and is being shared with false claims.\n\nOn various platforms of social networking website a video is being shared claiming it to be from China and relating it with coronavirus. Md Nasruddin Nasir, a Twitter user shared it with similar claims. User tweeted the video claiming that, \u201cChina deceived the world with the coronavirus pandemic and now is being punished by the God.\u201d\n\nCheck the archive version of the tweet. The video is being shared by the same claim on YouTube too. Check the archive version of the YouTube video too. The same video has been shared claiming it to be from China floods which also destroyed a bridge in the country. Check the Tweet\u2019s archive version of one such claim.\n\nVishvas News first used the InVID tool to check the video. We considered the key frames from the same. Later, we used the Google Reverse Image Search on the key frames that we received on the InVID. In the search result, it was suggested that the images appeared from the Japan\u2019s Tsunami disaster from the year 2011. We found numerous such old videos. Vishvas News found the very video being circulated with false claims on the YouTube channel takuro suzuki. This video was uploaded on 18 December 2011. Which obviously proves that it has no relation with the current situation in China. You can view the video as below.\n\nThe description of the video tells that the this is the Tsunami that was followed by an earthquake in the northern Japan. This video was taken from the roof of Ishinomaki Gas Company, which is a Japanese Gas Company. Another address in the video seen is, 2-3-48, Myojincho, Ishinomaki-shi, Miyagi. The screenshot of the description is as follows:\n\nWe saw a gas tank like structure in the video at 2 min 47 seconds, which can be seen in the viral video. The screen grab of that particular gas tank like structure can be seen below.\n\nFrom the description that we found on the YouTube and the address 2-3-48, Myojincho, Ishinomaki-shi, Miyagi, we opted for the Google Maps. On the Ishinomaki-shi, Miyagi street view we found the exact similar gas tank like structure.\n\nThis was hence proved that the video belongs to the Japan\u2019s deadly Tsunami of the year 2011. The video has been recorded from the roof of Ishinomaki Gas Agency.\n\nIn regards to the viral video, Vishvas News interacted with Assistant Professor Satyendra Singh Department of Higher Education, Geography at Madhya Pradesh. Satyendra Singh told Vishvas News, \u201cAn intense earthquake hit Japan in the year 2011. This intense earthquake resulted in Tsunami. This created a flood-like situation in Japan. This video belongs to that time.\u201d\n\nWe scanned the profile of the Twitter user who shared this video, Md Nasruddin Nasir. This profile was created in August 2020. Until the fact-check 83 people were following the user.\n\nConclusion: The video being widely shared on the social networking platform is not from China. This belongs to 2011 Japan\u2019s Tsunami disaster. Viral claim is fake.", "lang": "en"}
