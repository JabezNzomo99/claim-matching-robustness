People around the world have opposed mitigation measures designed to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus because of economic hardship and concerns over personal freedoms.\n\nAs COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, began to spread from its place of origin in Wuhan, China, other countries instituted social distancing policies and lockdowns to curb its transmission. Nations have ordered businesses to close, imposed travel restrictions, issued stay-at-home orders and established curfews, resulting in protests against these measures around the world.\n\nBut a post that has been shared widely on Twitter and Facebook wrongly claims that only Americans have protested these preventative measures.\n\nThe claim originated on Twitter from Robert James Pangelinan, a music DJ who works under the name Bear Grillz.\n\n\u201cHonest question: why do you think the United States is the only country on earth that is protesting being locked down?\u201d he tweeted on May 1. Another user replied, \u201cBecause people who have never truly been oppressed are being inconvenienced for the first time in their lives and don\u2019t understand what it means to sacrifice in the name of the greater good. Individualist culture, institutionalized racism, commodity fetishism and selfishness.\u201d\n\nBoth tweets were then made into a screenshot and posted to Facebook, where it has garnered hundreds of shares and tens of thousands of views.\n\nIndeed, there have been many demonstrations across the U.S. urging an end to stay-at-home policies and criticizing the governors who have issued the orders. But this is part of a worldwide trend spurred by worries about the economy and potential government overreach. For example:\n\u2022 In Poland, hundreds gathered on April 24 to protest closed borders and a mandatory two-week quarantine policy for people entering the country. Many protesters had jobs in Germany and couldn\u2019t go to work.\n\u2022 In India, migrant workers violated social distancing policies during a May 9 protest that resulted in confrontations with the police. Protesters sought to raise awareness of the plight of migrant workers, many of whom lost their jobs and were prevented from traveling home due to the lockdown.\n\u2022 In Belgium, restaurant workers brought attention to the economic impact of social distancing policies on the hospitality industry by laying down chefs\u2019 jackets in the Grand Place square in Brussels on May 7.\n\u2022 In Ivory Coast, protesters destroyed the construction site of a coronavirus testing center in early April over concerns that the facility would be a danger to residents.\n\nProtests continued within these countries and in others, including Iraq, Lebanon, and the UK.\n\nAs for the claim in the social media posts that Americans are protesting because they \u201care being inconvenienced,\u201d people have taken to the streets in the U.S. for a variety of reasons. While some protesters have touted conspiracy theories about the virus \u2014 many of which we\u2019ve debunked \u2014 others have expressed concerns about the economic impact of the virus. The number of jobless Americans rose to 20.5 million in April, and the unemployment rate more than tripled to 14.7% from March to April.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
