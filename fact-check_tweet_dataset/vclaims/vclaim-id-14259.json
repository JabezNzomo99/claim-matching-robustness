Other Facebook pages such as Defend Duterte and Fight4Digong have also been circulating the post. Readers e-mailed it to Rappler for verification.\n\n\"Yes definitely it's fake news, it's completely illogical for Mar, an advocate of consumer protection to say those things,\" Mar's campaign manager Edgar Erice confirmed to Rappler in a text message.\n\nRoxas' camp also explained the water crisis is not about the water shortage but is instead \"a shortage of competence on the part of Manila Water.\"\n\nIn an interview on March 20 in Batangas City Market, the senatorial candidate was also quoted as saying the crisis is a result of long-term events that need investigation.\n\nRappler asked the Facebook page Don't Me for the source of its post. It said the post is a reshare from Facebook Page Mocha Uson Blog. A check with that page, however, showed that there has not been a post about Roxas' supposed statement since the crisis erupted on March 7.\n\nMeanwhile, the photo of Roxas in the post is a manipulated photo of Rappler's instaquote on Roxas' statement on NAIA's bullet-planting scandal in 2015. \u2013 Addie Pobre, with reports from Mara Cepeda/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
