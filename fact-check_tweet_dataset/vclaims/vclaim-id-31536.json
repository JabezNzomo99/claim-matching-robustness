He was found alive while digging the mud to renovate the Valliyur Temple. He was sitting in Yogasana, when he was found\u2019. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of a Yogi who was found alive after being buried for 300 years in Tamil Nadu. Fact: The man in the video is neither a Yogi nor was buried for 300 years in Tamil Nadu. His name is Alexander, a resident of Kazakhstan. He was suffering from a disease called \u2018Psoriasis\u2019. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through Yandex Reverse Image Search, many articles with similar visuals were found in the search results. In the \u2018Daily Mail\u2019 article, it can be read that the man in the video is Alexander P, a resident of Aktobe city in Kazakhstan. In the article, it was found that the same video went viral previously with the claim that man in the video was attacked by a bear. Later, it was found that the man was not attacked by a bear but was suffering from a disease called \u2018Psoriasis\u2019.\n\nTalking to the \u2018Daily Mail\u2019, the doctor (who treated the man) said, \u2018Someone filmed him as he was undergoing medical assessment and leaked this to YouTube. He suffers from psoriasis but in his case worsened by his failure to seek medical treatment.\u2019 It was also reported by other media agencies that the man has \u2018died from sepsis after psoriasis wounds got infected\u2019. More information regarding the man can be found here, here and here.\n\nTo sum it up, the man is neither a yogi nor was buried for 300 years in Tamil Nadu.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
