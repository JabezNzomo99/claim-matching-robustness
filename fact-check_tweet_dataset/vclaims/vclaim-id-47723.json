Some people are even tagging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to focus his attention on the incident, urging him to take action against the miscreants. One of the comments on the video read:\n\nWhen the fact-checking team at NewsMobile checked the above post we found that the video that is widely being shared in India is actually from Sindh, Pakistan.\n\nUpon extracting the keyframes of the video through InVid and putting them through Reverse Image Search, we found the video on a page called Defence Pakistan.\n\nThe caption of the video read: \u201cUnder the protection of state, beating of doctors coming to take COVID test of respectfully quarantined in Sukhur Pakistan\u201d\n\nOn putting the keywords like \u201cquarantine\u201d, \u201cSukhur\u201d and \u201cPakistan\u201d on Google, we found a video of a quarantine facility in Pakistan uploaded by Pakistan Peoples Party. We also found an article by The Pakistan Post that shows the exact same building and the area as in the viral video.\n\nWhen we compared the buildings in the viral video to the buldings in the quarantine facility, we found that both the videos are taken from the same place.\n\nMoreover, on listening to the audio carefully, it is clear that the dialect in the video is different from the dialects spoken in India.\n\nHence, it proves that the viral video is from Pakistan.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
