This claim is false; all four photos have circulated in recent and old reports about locust swarms in Yemen, Kenya and the Canary Islands.\n\nThe photos, which show locusts swarming buildings and fields, were shared in this Facebook post on February 26, 2020. The post has been shared nearly 500 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nAccording to this March 1, 2020 report by the state-run Xinhua news agency, Chinese authorities have been monitoring locusts swarms, which can pose a serious threat to agriculture, in nearby countries. The risk, Xinhua added, remains \u201crelatively small\u201d but locust swarms could plague China's southwest if the pests are not effectively controlled.\n\nThe same photos of locusts swarming were also shared on Facebook here and here, alongside similar claims.\n\nHowever, this claim is false and the photos are being used in a misleading context.\n\nReverse Google image and keyword searches found that the photos have circulated in unrelated reports about locust plagues in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nThe first photo was traced to this July 25, 2019 report by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.\n\nIts caption states: \u201cA mature swarm flying over a village near Abyan, Yemen, looking for suitable areas to lay eggs that will hatch after about two weeks.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison showing the first photo in the misleading post (L) and the FAO photo (R):\n\nThe second photo appears on this page on the website of the Associated Press (AP).\n\nIts caption states in part: \u201cSwarms of desert locusts fly up into the air from crops in Katitika village, Kitui county, Kenya Friday, Jan. 24, 2020.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison showing the second photo in the misleading post (L) and the AP photo (R):\n\nThe third photo was taken back in 2004 by the European Pressphoto Agency (EPA), and can be viewed on the news agency\u2019s website here.\n\nA portion of its caption reads: \u201cThousands of African locusts fly around at a Fuerteventura beach, Canary Islands, on Monday, 29 November 2004.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison showing the third photo in the misleading post (L) and the EPA photo (R):\n\nFinally, the fourth photo is from this Reuters page, and is captioned: \u201cA swarm of desert locusts fly over a grazing land in Nakwamuru village, Samburu County, Kenya January 16, 2020.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison showing the fourth photo in the misleading post (L) and the Reuters photo (R):\n\nRappler, a Philippine media organization, has also previously fact-checked the photos.", "lang": "en"}
