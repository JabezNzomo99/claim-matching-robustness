No, the 'emergency broadcast' is fictional\n\nMultiple posts shared hundreds of times on Facebook and Twitter warn of an upcoming 12-hour period in Hong Kong when \u201cany and all crime, including murder, will be legal\u201d. But the text of the supposed \u201cemergency broadcast\u201d is fictional; it is nearly identical to the wording of an announcement featured in 2013 American horror film \u201cThe Purge\u201d.\n\nAn image containing a lengthy warning message was published in this Facebook post dated July 23, 2019, which has been shared more than 600 times.\n\n\u201cThis is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the Annual Purge sanctioned by the Hong Kong Government,\u201d says one line of text in the image.\n\nLower down, the message also says: \u201cCommencing at the siren, any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours.\u201d\n\nThe same text has been shared repeatedly on Facebook and Twitter in July 2019 alongside other similar warning messages written in English and Filipino, for example here and here.\n\nThere is no indication given that the posts are satirical or not to be taken seriously.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of one of the misleading Facebook posts:\n\nThere are around 184,000 Filipino citizens living in Hong Kong, according to this government website.\n\nThe semi-autonomous southern Chinese city has seen widespread protests and violent clashes between demonstrators and police during the summer of 2019.\n\nHere is a recent AFP article about the unrest, which was triggered by opposition to a planned extradition law but has evolved into a wider movement for democratic reforms.\n\nSome words and phrases in the misleading posts refer to these events; for example \u201cThe Purge (Hong Kong, Yuen Long) Announcement\u201d and \u201cMember of the Legislative Council, Junius Ho-Kwan-yiu, will support \u2018the white team\u2019\u201d.\n\nYuen Long is a town in Hong Kong where suspected triad gangsters, wearing white T-shirts, attacked people in a train station on July 21, 2019. Here is an AFP report about that incident.\n\nJunius Ho Kwan-yiu is a member of Hong Kong\u2019s Legislative Council of Hong Kong who is pro-Beijing and has defended the men who attacked people in Yuen Long, as described in this article by local newspaper the South China Morning Post.\n\nA keyword search for the warning text on social networks including YouTube led to this mock trailer about the protests, posted to YouTube on July 22, 2019, titled: \u201cTHE PURGE IN Hong Kong (YUEN LONG) Trailer 27/7/2019(SAT)\u201d.\n\nThe YouTube video\u2019s Chinese-language description, translated in full below, says that the story shown in the video is \u201cpurely fictional\u201d.\n\nAn announcement with the same wording as the misleading Facebook posts can be seen 57 seconds into the video:\n\nThe video\u2019s full description, translated to English, says:\n\n\u201cOn July 21, 2019, a group of white-clad gangsters from the village attacked innocent residents in Yuen Long, including pregnant women and journalists. The Hong Kong police colluded with the gangs, and did not attend and arrest the white-clad mob, instead they pat their shoulders and talked with them in a harmonious atmosphere.\n\n\u201cFor Hong Kong people who believe in justice, it's infuriating. July 27, 2019, Saturday, will be designated as the Hong Kong's National Killing Day and Yuen Long will be the experimental area. Hong Kong people have decided to fight against the garbage regime till death.\n\n\u201cOn July 27, 2019 Hong Kongers see you in Yuen Long. This story is purely fictional. Any resemblance to actual individuals or events are coincidental.\u201d\n\nThere is an American horror film called \u201cThe Purge\u201d about a one-day killing spree sanctioned by the US government, which was released in 2013; here is its IMDB page.\n\nThis clip from the film, uploaded to YouTube on March 31, 2014, includes an announcement that is worded nearly identically to the message in the Hong Kong trailer and misleading posts.\n\nOnly the place names have been changed and the reference to Junius Ho and \u201cthe white team\u201d has been inserted into the text.\n\nThe announcement appears around 22 seconds into the clip embedded below:\n\nThe misleading posts say that Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cPurge\u201d will take place on July 27, 2019; no such event took place on that day.\n\nComments such as the one below indicated that some people believed the misleading post.\n\nThe comment below, when translated to English, says: \u201cThe Filipino and Filipina OFWs there are pitiful they will be affected please let\u2019s pray for them\u201d. OFW stands for Overseas Foreign Worker.", "lang": "en"}
