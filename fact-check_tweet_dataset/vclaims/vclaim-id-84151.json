The claim is false; the photo shows a Yemeni man holding his daughter after she was killed in an airstrike in 2015.\n\nThe image was contained in this Facebook post, which has been shared more than 180,000 times since it was published on April 22, 2018. It contains text in Hindi which translates to English as:\n\n\u201cThere is an iron rod in the middle of this child's eye and the parents have no money for the surgery. If you share this, then they will get one Indian rupee per share. So friends share it with full power and be a part of this good deed.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe same image and claim were also shared here on a Hindi-langauge social network called ShareChat.\n\nBut the claim is false; the child seen in the photo is dead.\n\nA reverse image search on Google led to this article on the website of Catherine Shakdam, who describes herself on the site as a \u201cgeopolitical analyst and commentator for the Middle East\u201d.\n\nThe article, dated August 28, 2016, and also published here by the Huffington Post, is headlined: \u201cA father\u2019s cry \u2013 Yemen\u2019s war victim calls for legal actions against Saudi Arabia\u201d.\n\nIn the article, Shakdam states that she interviewed the man in the photo, Ibrahim Abdulkarim, about the death of his daughter Zainab in the Yemeni capital Sana\u2019a.\n\nFurther Google and Facebook searches in English and Arabic found this post published by Abdulkarim on his Facebook page on February 26, 2016, which contains the same photo as in the false post.\n\nBelow is a comparison between screenshots of the false post (L) and the original post on Abdulkarim\u2019s Facebook page (R):\n\nThe Arabic-language caption on Abdulkarim\u2019s post says, translated to English:\n\n\u201cO God, accept our sacrifice, O God. The last picture with my martyr daughter Zainab \u2013 in the refrigerator of the 'revolution hospital' in Sana'a. She was killed by Saudi Arabia-led coalition airforces.\u201d\n\nOther posts on Abdulkarim\u2019s Facebook page state that his daughter was killed in Sana\u2019a on July 3, 2015, for example this one dated July 6, 2015, and this one dated March 7, 2016.\n\nHis post embedded below, dated July 7, 2016, shows the pair on an unspecified date before the airstrike:\n\nAbdulkarim\u2019s story has been reported by multiple international media organisations, for example here by American broadcaster PRI and here in The Guardian.\n\nWhen asked whether they ever paid for likes or shares of posts, Facebook told AFP in a statement:\n\n\u201cWe have clear policies about authenticity in our Community Standards, that state we do not allow people to use misleading or inaccurate information to collect likes, followers, or shares. We encourage anyone who encounters this on Facebook to report it.\u201d\n\nIn this Facebook post dated December 27, 2017, Abdulkarim addresses the false posts that say Facebook will donate money to the child.\n\nThe Arabic-language caption says, translated to English:\n\n\"Someone is using my daughter Zeinab's image to beg. He's saying that she's sick and needs treatment. I tell the one who's begging with a martyred child photo, fear God. And I ask you to help me in finding this page on Facebook.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of that Facebook post:", "lang": "en"}
