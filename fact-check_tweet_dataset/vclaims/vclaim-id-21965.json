Under the leadership of PM Shri @narendramodi, India continues on improving innovation including ICT services, exports, patents and R&D.\u2019 Here is a fact check of this claim.\n\nWhat is the Global Innovation Index?\n\nGlobal Innovation Index (GII) is an annual ranking which measures the innovation performance of a country\u2019s economy based on innovation capabilities and results. GII is a joint effort among Cornell University, World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) and INSEAD. This year, the 12th edition of the index was launched in India by Piyush Goyal, Minister of Commerce and Industry. The theme of GII this year is Medical Innovation.\n\nThe overall GII is calculated as the simple average of Input Sub Index score and Output Sub Index Score. Innovation Input Sub Index is arrived at by taking into consideration Institutions, Human Capital and Research, Infrastructure, Market Sophistication and Business Sophistication. Similarly, the Innovation Output Sub Index Score is calculated based on Knowledge and Technology outputs and Creative outputs. Each of these seven pillars is further subdivided into three sub pillars which have individual indicators associated with them based on which GII is calculated.\n\nWhat is the difference between Global Innovation Index 2015 and 2019?\n\nThe GII theme in 2015 was \u2018Effective Innovation Policies for Development\u2019- where an attempt was made to identify successful policy intervention in 141 economies across the globe. The theme for the GII 2019 is \u2018Creating Healthy Lives- the Future of Medical Innovation\u2019- where focus has been on improving healthcare through medical innovations, both technological and non-technological in 129 economies. The 2015 GII was calculated on the basis of 79 indicators whereas in 2019, a total of 80 indicators were used.\n\nIndia\u2019s position in the annual ranking since 2007 is in the following chart. The high variation in the ranking can be attributed to the modifications made to the methodology for calculating the ranks. India\u2019s best rank so far was in 2007 when it was ranked 23rd out of 107 countries.\n\nThe GII ranking involved a different number of countries each year. The ranking was done for 107 countries in 2007 which increased to a high of 143 in 2014. In 2019, a total of 129 countries were ranked.\n\nHas India\u2019s ranking improved in the last few years with respect to the Individual Indicators?\n\nWhile India was ranked 81 in 2015, India\u2019s rank in 2019 has gone up to 52, an improvement of 29 positions. Notable gains in patent applications, ICT services, exports, labour productivity, Gross Expenditure on R&D and Global R&D companies have been claimed to be made under the NDA government. Here, we take a closer look.\n\nThe measure of \u2018Patent families filed in more than two offices\u2019 is an indicator of Business Sophistication while Patent applications by origin and Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications by origin are indicators under the pillar of \u2018Knowledge and Technology Output.\u2019\n\nPatent families filed in two offices is the number of patent families filed by residents in at least two offices (per billion PPP $GDP). By patent family, reference is made to a set of interrelated patent applications filed in one or more countries/jurisdictions for the same invention. In 2015, the calculation was done including those filed in minimum three offices.\n\nPatent applications by origin (Domestic resident patent) refers to the number of resident patent applications filed at a given national or regional patent office (per billion PPP$ GDP).\n\nPCT applications by origin is the number of patent applications filed by residents (per billion PPP$ GDP) through the WIPO-administered Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT).\n\nIndia\u2019s Ranking: The ranking on the basis of number of PCT applications filed in India has increased from 49 in 2015 to 51 in 2019. Further, difference in methodology with respect to patent families could have influenced the ranking. The ranking with respect to the Domestic Resident Patent has improved by one position and the ranking in patent families filed has improved by 6, from 52 in 2015 to 46 in 2019.\n\nThe report also highlighted the Government\u2019s online service and e-participation under Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) as strengths. At the same time, access and use of ICTs have been identified as weaknesses.\n\nHow are these indicators are calculated?\n\nUse of ICT\u2013 weights Percentage of individuals using the Internet; Fixed (wired)-broadband Internet subscriptions per 100 inhabitants and active mobile-broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants at 33% each.\n\nICT Access\u2013 weights Fixed telephone subscriptions per 100 inhabitants; Mobile cellular telephone subscriptions per 100 inhabitants; International Internet bandwidth (bit/s) per Internet user; Percentage of households with a computer and Percentage of households with Internet access at 20% each.\n\nGovernment\u2019s Online Service Index\u2013 Measures government\u2019s use of ICT in delivering public services at national level with the help of an Online Service Questionnaire which consisted of a list of 140 questions assessed by UN volunteers.\n\nOnline e-participation- calculated as E-Participation Index, it reflects the e-participation mechanisms that are deployed by the government as compared to all other countries.\n\nIndia\u2019s ranking in each of these categories in 2015 & 2019 is as follows.\n\nIndia\u2019s Ranking: India\u2019s ranking has improved substantially in all of these indicators. The greatest improvement was seen in Government Online Service where the ranking improved from 57 in 2015 to 9 in 2019. Even in e-participation, ranking has improved from 40 in 2015 to 15 in 2019. However, India\u2019s rank is still above 100 in both ICT use & ICT access.\n\nFrom the report, there are four main export types which serve as indicators in the Index. These are high-tech exports and ICT service exports which fall under the pillar of \u2018Knowledge and Technology Outputs\u2019 and Cultural and Creative services exports and Creative good exports which fall under the pillar of \u2018Creative Outputs\u2019. The definition of each of these export types is the following.\n\nHigh-tech exports- net high-tech exports as the percentage of total trade have been considered in the ranking. It is calculated as high-technology exports minus re-exports as percentage of total trade.\n\nICT services exports is found out as the Telecommunications, computers, and information services exports as percentage of total trade\n\nCultural and Creative services exports is calculated in terms of percentage of total trade and includes information services, advertising, market research, cultural and recreational services and more.\n\nCreative good exports are determined as the total value of creative goods exports, net of re-exports (current US$) over total trade. Creative goods are those which are defined by UNESCO Framework in 2006 which include arts and craft and cultural goods.\n\nIndia\u2019s ranking in 2015 & 2019 each of these categories is as follows\n\nIndia\u2019s Ranking: India\u2019s ranking has improved in the \u2018Cultural & creative services exports\u2019 from 59 in 2015 to 39 in 2019. In the other categories, India\u2019s rank has deteriorated. India has retained the top position in the ICT exports.\n\nThe labour productivity is be measured from \u2018growth rate of GDP per person engaged\u2019. It is defined as output per unit of labour input. India was ranked 38 in 2015. In 2018 and 2019, labour productivity has improved and India\u2019s ranking is 4.\n\nCalculated as the total domestic intramural expenditure (Total expenditure for R&D within a statistical unit or sector of economy during a specific period) on research and development during a given period as a percentage of GDP, the indicator is used to determine the performance of R&D in a country. India was ranked 42 in 2015, 52 in 2018 and 50 in 2019. Hence, India\u2019s rank has deteriorated in this aspect compared to 2015.\n\nThis indicator was not available in the 2015 report. In the 2019 report, India has been ranked 15 based on the average expenditure by the top 3 companies in Research and Development. The 2018 report ranked India at 18. Thus, there has been an improvement in India\u2019s rank.\n\nOverall, while India\u2019s rank has improved, it has not improved on all the indicators and this is not India\u2019s best rank ever.", "lang": "en"}
