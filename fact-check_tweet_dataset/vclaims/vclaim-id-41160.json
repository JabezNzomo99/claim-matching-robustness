Gasoline price experts say prices spiked over the last few weeks in California due to unexpected refinery outages that reduced the gasoline supply. With the outages now repaired, that temporary bump should begin to recede over the next few weeks, experts told us.\n\nBut California gasoline prices consistently exceed the national average due to the state\u2019s high gas taxes, environmental fees and the cost associated with the state requiring a cleaner-burning gasoline blend.\n\nSince 2015, however, prices have risen higher than can be explained by those higher taxes and regulations. That has prompted an investigation by the California Energy Commission, at the behest of the governor. But none of the potential underlying causes identified to date has anything to do with the state\u2019s efforts to mandate cars with higher fuel efficiency.\n\nIn fact, the proposed automobile fuel standards promoted by California would not diverge from the national standards proposed by Trump until model year 2021. And experts say those higher fuel standards for automobiles wouldn\u2019t place any upward pressure on gasoline prices anyway.\n\nNonetheless, in a tweet this week, Trump linked his administration\u2019s ongoing feud with California over auto fuel standards with the state\u2019s spiking gasoline prices.\n\nTrump\u2019s numbers are off a bit. GasBuddy reports regular gasoline was selling at an average of $4.176 per gallon in California on Oct. 11, the highest rate in the country, while the national average was $2.642. AAA reported nearly identical figures: $4.180 per gallon in California, and a national average of $2.641. We have written about Trump\u2019s dubious claims that California\u2019s efforts to mandate higher fuel efficiency in new cars makes them less safe. Experts told us that is not likely true. And the president has also inflated the added cost of more fuel efficient cars, failing to account for such things as fuel cost savings.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet drew a sarcastic response from California\u2019s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, who wrote, \u201cthose electric vehicles we\u2019re encouraging car companies to manufacture sure are gas guzzlers!\u201d\n\nTom Kloza, an oil industry analyst and a founder of the Oil Price Information Service, told us that the president linking higher gas prices in California to the state\u2019s efforts to require more fuel-efficient cars is inaccurate.\n\n\u201cMandates to use electric vehicles or the effort by the state to keep tougher CAFE standards would argue for less demand in the future, so it is not accurate to attribute the higher prices to those initiatives,\u201d Kloza told us via email.\n\nWhat Caused the Recent Price Spike in California?\n\nAverage gasoline prices spiked in California between Sept. 1 and Oct. 1, rising just over 42 cents per gallon to $4.15, according to GasBuddy. Over the same period, the national average for a gallon of regular gasoline only rose about 5 cents.\n\nGasoline price experts told us the disproportionate jump in California is due to unexpected refinery outages, which have since been fixed.\n\n\u201cCalifornia\u2019s gas prices are high now because there have been a number of refinery outages that caused supply to shrink in the state (and regionally in the West Coast market),\u201d AAA spokesman Devin Gladden told us via email.\n\nIndeed, national gas price maps show that all eight states with the highest average gasoline prices are concentrated on the West Coast.\n\n\u201cWhen supply shrinks while demand remains robust, prices typically spike,\u201d Gladden said. \u201cIt\u2019s unusual to see this happen in the fall, since prices across the nation typically decrease as a result of lower gas demand and the switchover to cheaper to produce winter blend gasoline. That is what is occurring to the prices in the majority of states \u2014 but given California\u2019s gas supply challenges, prices have risen there and in the region.\u201d\n\nPatrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, said the unexpected refinery outages came at a time when other refineries were undergoing planned maintenance, causing gasoline supply shortages. The refineries are back online now, and prices in California should start to decline rapidly as a result, he said. He forecasts prices will dip by 50 cents per gallon in California over the next six weeks or so.\n\nWhy Is Gas Always So Expensive in California?\n\nAside from the recent spike, the average price for gasoline in California is typically about a dollar per gallon higher than the national average, DeHaan told us. Gasoline price experts say there are a number of reasons for that. For starters, California has the highest state taxes on gasoline in the country, adding about 62 cents per gallon, according to the American Petroleum Institute. That\u2019s nearly 26 cents per gallon higher than the national average. Last November, California voters rejected efforts to repeal a 12-cent per gallon gasoline tax, the proceeds of which support highway repair and other transportation infrastructure improvements.\n\nCalifornia also requires a special cleaner-burning blend of gasoline that adds a bit to the cost. \u201cRefiners make more profit on gasoline produced at California refineries, and not all U.S. or worldwide refiners can make the tough specification gasoline,\u201d Kloza told us. It also creates a bigger challenge to resupply when there are unexpected refinery outages, DeHaan said.\n\nAnd the state has a cap-and-trade program that seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The program results in higher costs to petroleum producers, which in turn contributes to higher prices at the pump.\n\nStill, those factors don\u2019t account for all of the price differential in California.\n\n\u201cCalifornia can be viewed as a less competitive market than other regions since there are fewer competing companies in refining and the state is a vast distance from other refining centers in the U.S. (Gulf Coast and Northeast) and the world,\u201d Kloza said. \u201cThe amount of refining capacity in California and the Pacific Northwest has shrunk a bit this century in comparison to the addition of perhaps 2-million barrels per day of additional capacity east of the Rockies. No additional refining and population growth is a dynamic that is unique to western states.\u201d Other factors like more expensive real estate in California also play a role in gasoline prices.\n\nAll of those factors explain why Californians pay more for gasoline than most others around the country, but they don\u2019t explain the widening divergence between California\u2019s gasoline prices and the national average beginning in 2015, said Severin Borenstein, a business and public policy professor at the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business. Borenstein has written extensively about what he calls the Mystery Gasoline Surcharge in California, a phenomenon that he said could be tied to any number of factors from a decline of competition to \u201clogistical problems with importation or distribution of gasoline.\u201d\n\nIn April, Gov. Newsom raised the specter of \u201cinappropriate industry practices\u201d and directed the California Energy Commission to look into the state\u2019s inordinately high gasoline prices. A preliminary report from the commission in May referred to a \u201cresidual price increase\u201d \u2014 above and beyond what could be accounted for by the state\u2019s taxes and regulations \u2014 which it says ranged from an extra 17 cents to 34 cents per gallon since 2015.\n\n\u201cThe Energy Commission has identified a number of possible causes that could explain the residual price increase in California, ranging from refinery outages to potentially market manipulation,\u201d the report states. It also called for a fuller study that is due to be presented in the coming weeks.\n\nThe California Energy Commission\u2019s report doesn\u2019t mention the state\u2019s row with Trump over regulations on fuel efficiency standards for automobiles. Trump has proposed to freeze fuel economy standards put in place by the Obama administration at 2020 levels through 2026. Trump\u2019s plan also revokes California\u2019s ability to set stricter standards, which the state wants to do. Four major auto companies drew the ire of the president last summer when they struck a deal with California to largely adhere to the Obama-era standards. That deal came after talks between the Trump administration and the state broke down. California and 22 other states are now suing the administration, seeking the right to allow California to set its own pollution limits on automobiles.\n\nAs for Trump\u2019s dig that more fuel efficient cars proposed by California aren\u2019t \u201cdoing the trick\u201d to lower gasoline prices, experts told us that argument is a non sequitur. For one, Trump\u2019s proposed freeze is not scheduled to come into play until model year 2021. So the idea that those changes may have affected California\u2019s gas prices now makes no sense from a timing perspective. On top of that, there\u2019s no reason to to believe more fuel efficient cars would create upward pressure on gasoline pricing anyway.", "lang": "en"}
