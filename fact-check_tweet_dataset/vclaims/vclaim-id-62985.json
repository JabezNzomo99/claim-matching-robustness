The search led us to a report by Dainik Jagran dated May 18, 2020, which featured the same video.\n\nThe report suggested that the incident took place when the lady cook served food in a plate and placed it on the bench. However, some of the migrant labourers asked to sit and eat disobeying the social distancing norms. On refusal by the cook, the migrants kicked the food that was lying on the bench and created a ruckus. The incident took place at Saharghat Quarantine Center in Bihar where 25 migrant labourers are in quarantine.\n\nNewsMobile contacted SHO Saharghat, Surendra Paswan, who clarified that there was no communal angle to the incident.\n\n\u201cThe incident took place as a few migrant labourers were not following the social distancing norms,\u201d Paswan told NewsMobile. On being asked if there was any communal link to it, he said, \u201call such claims are rubbish\u201d.\n\nHence, in conclusion, the above information proves that the claim attached to the viral video is FAKE.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
