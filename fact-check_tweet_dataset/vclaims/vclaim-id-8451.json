Watch a replay along with real time analysis here, and read an annotated transcript of the speech. \u201cSince the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone.\u201d The math is correct, but context matters. The economy has added about 169,000 jobs a month since the 2016 election, but that is somewhat less than the 185,000 jobs per month that the economy added over the previous seven years. \u201cAfrican-American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded.\u201d It\u2019s true that the black unemployment rate in December, 6.8 percent, was the lowest recorded, but that is also the culmination of a longer-term trend. Moreover, it\u2019s an open question how much credit a president, especially in his first year, can take for the economy. \u201cAfter years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages.\u201d Wages are, in fact, rising \u2014 but at a slower rate than they were at the end of President Obama\u2019s second term. \u201cWe eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year \u2014 forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they couldn\u2019t afford government-ordered health plans. We repealed the core of disastrous Obamacare \u2014 the individual mandate is now gone.\u2019\u2019 In the newly passed tax law, Congress eliminated penalties for people who go without health insurance, starting in 2019. An estimated 4.5 percent of taxpayers paid the penalty in 2015, and nearly 60 percent of those who did earned less than $50,000 in 2015 \u2014 though the Kaiser Family Foundation found that a sizable amount of low-income Americans paying the penalty could find coverage for less. People could, in many cases, obtain exemptions from the penalties that were indeed a major element of the Affordable Care Act. Other elements of the health care law remain intact. \u201cApple has just announced its plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers.\u201d The technology giant Apple did, indeed, say after the tax cut passed that it would \u201cinvest\u201d $350 billion domestically over the next five years. But at least $275 billion of that was simply continuing the company\u2019s past spending trends. The actual amount of new investment appears to be roughly $37 billion.\n\n\u201cMany car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States \u2014 something we have not seen for decades.\u201d Yes, some car companies have announced new or expanded plants under Trump, but that\u2019s hardly new or unseen \u201cfor decades.\u201d Toyota, for example, opened a plant in Mississippi in 2011. There has been no surge in automotive employment under his tenure \u2014 it\u2019s actually down from a year ago. \u201cLast year, the F.D.A. approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever before in our history.\u2019\u2019 The Food and Drug Administration approved 1,027 generic drugs in the 2017 fiscal year, the highest annual total in the agency\u2019s history. Scott Gottlieb, the F.D.A. commissioner, also said that the agency approved 95 novel medical devices last year, another record. \u201cWe have ended the war on American energy \u2014 and we have ended the war on beautiful, clean coal. We are now very proudly an exporter of energy to the world.\u201d Over all, the United States is a net energy importer, although it is projected to be a net energy exporter sometime in the 2020s. A government analysis found that the United States became a net exporter of natural gas in 2017 for the first time since 1957, and it remains a net exporter of coal. But it is still a net importer of oil. While it is accurate that Mr. Trump has ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to roll back regulations on the burning of coal, it has done almost nothing to revive the industry, which, economists note, was already in decline because of competition from cheaper sources like natural gas. \u201cChrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan.\u201d Chrysler announced that it would move production of heavy-duty pickup trucks from Saltillo, Mexico, to a plant in Michigan. But a truck plant in Saltillo will remain open and be \u201crepurposed to produce future commercial vehicles for global distribution,\u201d according to the automaker. Other plants in Mexico will also continue operations. \u201cOne of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs. In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States, and it\u2019s very, very unfair.\u2019\u2019 Prices for brand-name prescription drugs are typically higher in the United States than in other developed countries, which regulate prices or set them through negotiations with drug manufacturers. Drug makers have strenuously opposed regulation of prices in this country. Cancer drugs and other new medicines sometimes enter the U.S. market with prices exceeding $50,000 a year. And a handful of companies have driven up the prices of some decades-old drugs whose patents expired years ago. \u201cWe built the Empire State Building in just one year \u2014 isn\u2019t it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a permit approved for a simple road?\u201d The Empire State Building was built in just over a year. But construction time shouldn\u2019t be compared with the time needed to get a permit (the design for the Empire State Building changed at least 15 times during planning and construction). The requirements for construction and permits are also different between roads and buildings, two different pieces of infrastructure. Mr. Trump is also overstating the process for building roads. While some bigger projects can take around 10 years to receive permits, small projects, like repaving a road, can take little to no time at all. Average wait times have ranged from three to six years over the past two decades, according to the Federal Highway Administration.\n\n\u201cThe second pillar fully secures the border. That means building a wall on the Southern border, and it means hiring more heroes like C.J. to keep our communities safe.\u201d Homeland Security officials say a border wall would slow the influx of illegal immigrants and drug smugglers and help Border Patrol agents stop them. But it, alone, would not fully stop immigration or the flow of drugs; nor would it make the border fully secure. A majority of border crossings occurred in places where fencing or walls already exist. Just 30 percent of known illegal entries took place in areas without border fencing. \u201cThe third pillar ends the visa lottery \u2014 a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit or the safety of our people.\u201d The visa lottery program provides 50,000 immigrant visas to people from countries with low immigration rates to the United States. An 18-page guide from the State Department says applicants must have a high school education or two years of work experience in the past five years that requires \u201ctwo years of training or experience.\u201d The applicant must undergo a medical exam and cannot have a criminal record. Visa winners are then subjected to a lengthy background check that can last for months. \u201cUnder the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives.\u201d Immigrants who obtain green cards or citizenship can petition to bring in their relatives. But that doesn\u2019t automatically allow entry into the United States. Anyone applying for residency must undergo national security and criminal background checks. The federal government also places annual caps on the number of immigrants\u2019 married children and adult siblings who can sponsor for a visa. The system is badly backlogged; as of Nov. 1, more than 3.9 million people were waiting in line. Some siblings of immigrants who in 2004 petitioned for a visa to come to the United States were just this month starting to have their claims processed. \u201cThe coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated almost 100 percent of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria.\u201d Mr. Trump is correct that the Islamic State has been forced from most of its previously held territory \u2014 98 percent \u2014 in Iraq and Syria. But he is reaping the advantage of a strategy begun in the Obama administration. American-led forces had already wrested more than 13,000 square miles of territory from the group by the time Mr. Trump was elected in November 2016. Things accelerated after he gave American commanders more authority to order airstrikes and make battlefield decisions. But the defeat of the caliphate does not mean the end of the Islamic State, or ISIS, as a movement or ideology.\n\n\u201cThe stock market has smashed one record after another.\u201d The United States stock market has indeed surged since Mr. Trump took office, with the S. & P. 500 stock index rising 24.7 percent and notching a series of record highs. By comparison, the same index was up 26.3 percent at the same point during President Barack Obama\u2019s administration in 2009 and early 2010. Back then, level of the stock market was significantly lower, reflecting the impact of the financial crisis in the United States and the deep recession that followed. Under Mr. Obama, stocks continued to recover and also notched a series of record highs, starting in 2013. \u201cAmerica has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our nation\u2019s wealth.\u201d Economists say the loss of manufacturing jobs has more to do with automation and globalization than specific trade deals. Research suggests that the North American Free Trade Agreement has had a negligible effect on American jobs. And China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001 seems to have had a more pronounced impact on factory jobs. While Mr. Trump has abandoned the trans-Pacific Partnership, negotiations to revamp Nafta are ongoing. \u201cSince we passed tax cuts, roughly three million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses \u2014 many of them thousands of dollars per worker.\u201d The statistic comes from a list of tax-related corporate announcements compiled by Americans for Tax Reform, an enthusiastic booster of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts. His wording is carefully phrased. Mr. Trump notes \u201cmany\u201d of the announced bonuses amount to thousands of dollars, a number that is vague enough to be defensible. (He also could have said \u201cmany of them hundreds of dollars per worker\u201d and been correct, as well.) READ MORE: The Times is tracking companies that have made announcements about bonuses and other employment benefits because of the tax law. \u201cWe enacted the biggest tax cuts and reform in American history.\u201d Mr. Trump won\u2019t stop making this claim, even though zero evidence supports it. Tax cuts signed by President Ronald Reagan were larger as a share of the economy and in terms of their effects on federal revenues. The recently passed tax bill appears to rank 12th in American history, as a share of the economy.\n\nJoseph P. Kennedy III delivered the Democratic response to the State of the Union. Below is a fact check of his remarks. \u201cTop C.E.O.s making 300 times the average worker is not right.\u201d Mr. Kennedy is most likely referring to a 2014 study from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. It said that pay for chief executives at the top 350 American firms were about 300 times more than their employees. But that sample represents a small fraction of all American businesses, and not a very representative one. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, chief executives made an average salary of $194,000 in 2016, about four times what the average worker made.", "lang": "en"}
