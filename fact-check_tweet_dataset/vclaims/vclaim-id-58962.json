The lion pictured was actually receiving a CAT scan for a medical issue.\n\nFor roughly a century, a roaring lion has been featured in the well-known MGM Studios logo, according to Smithsonian Magazine. Several lions, including Leo, Tanner, Jackie and George, have appeared in the logo over the years, the magazine reported.\n\nThe Facebook post alleges that the photo of a lion lying on a table with its head through a large MGM Studios sign depicts the famous logo being filmed, with the caption partly reading, \u201cTurns out he\u2019s really not that Ferocious\u2026\u2026\u2026just really PISSED OFF\u2026\u2026.You would be, too!\u201d\n\nIn reality, the lion pictured was not involved in the creation of the logo for MGM Studios. The film company\u2019s logo has been photoshopped into the image.

The Telegraph, a British news outlet, published the photo with a similar description in August 2018.\n\n\u201cTwo-year-old Samson, a Barbary lion, undergoing a (big) CAT scan at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2005,\u201d reads The Telegraph\u2019s caption. \u201cSamson became a star attraction at an Israeli zoo after his life was saved by a vet in a pioneering nine hour brain operation.\u201d\n\nSamson suffered from \u201cdamage to the posterior portion of his skull, which applied pressure on his cerebellum and the upper sector of the spinal cord,\u201d Dr. Merav Shamir, a veterinary neurological specialist at the Koret School of Veterinary Medicine, said in a Hebrew University of Jerusalem press release. The veterinary team used a CAT scan to diagnose Samson\u2019s condition, and he underwent an operation to treat it, according to Business Insider.\n\nThe lion successfully recovered from the operation and was reunited with his sister Delilah at the zoo in less than two weeks, according to the press release.", "lang": "en"}
