Lewis that describes \u201cthe fear of getting sick\u201d and its effects, suggesting that the British writer prophesied the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is no evidence Lewis ever wrote these words.\n\nThe alleged quote begins \u201cAnd how did you manage to bring so many souls to hell at that time? -Because of fear (\u2026) Fear of getting sick.\u201d The exchange continues \u201cthey had no human contact for days and days\u201d, \u201cthey lost their jobs, spent all their savings\u201d and \u201cthey did not leave their house, did not walk, did not visit their relatives.\u201d\n\nOne version of the claim ( here ) alleges the quote appears in Lewis\u2019 \u201cThe Screwtape Letters\u201d, published in 1942. It consists of a set of letters from a devil, Screwtape, to his nephew, Wormwood, in which Lewis examines theological issues related to temptation ( here ).\n\nThe exchange presented in this claim does not appear in the book ( here ) .\n\nOther iterations (here, here , here and here) attribute the extract to a book by C.S. Lewis allegedly titled \u201cThe Devil's Letters to His Nephew\u201d. This is a direct translation from the Spanish edition of The Screwtape Letters (known in Spanish as \u201cCartas del Diablo a su sobrino\u201d) ( amzn.to/2WbiyS3 )\n\nProfessor Joel Heck of Concordia University Texas, author of four books on C.S. Lewis, told Reuters these words were not written by the author. \u201cIt\u2019s not Lewis. The theology [apparently Christian] fits Lewis, and the language sounds a bit Screwtapian, so it lends itself to believability,\u201d Heck said in an email.\n\nWilliam O'Flaherty, a researcher of quotations falsely attributed to C. S. Lewis, also debunked this quote here .\n\nThe Reuters Fact Check team has previously debunked another quote misattributed to Lewis, who is best known as the author of \u201cThe Chronicles of Narnia\u201d here .\n\nFalse. C.S. Lewis did not write the \u201cprophetic\u201d words attributed to him in the post.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
