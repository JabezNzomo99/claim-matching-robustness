It shows Ayodhya is land of Lord Ram\u201d, reads the viral message. The same has been posted on Twitter. The image has also been shared with a message in Telugu which reads, \u201c\u0c05\u0c2f\u0c4b\u0c27\u0c4d\u0c2f\u0c32\u0c4b \u0c2e\u0c41\u0c38\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c40\u0c2e\u0c41\u0c32\u0c15\u0c41 \u0c07\u0c1a\u0c4d\u0c1a\u0c47 5 \u0c0e\u0c15\u0c30\u0c3e\u0c32 \u0c2d\u0c42\u0c2e\u0c3f\u0c32\u0c4b \u0c05\u0c15\u0c4d\u0c15\u0c21 \u0c2a\u0c46\u0c26\u0c4d\u0c26 \u0c17\u0c41\u0c02\u0c24 \u0c24\u0c35\u0c4d\u0c35\u0c41\u0c24\u0c41\u0c02\u0c1f\u0c47 \u0c2a\u0c41\u0c30\u0c3e\u0c24\u0c28 \u0c2e\u0c48\u0c28 \u0c39\u0c28\u0c41\u0c2e\u0c3e\u0c28\u0c4d \u0c35\u0c3f\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c39\u0c02 \u0c2c\u0c2f\u0c1f\u0c2a\u0c21\u0c3f\u0c02\u0c26\u0c3f\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u0c07\u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c2a\u0c41\u0c21\u0c41 \u0c0f\u0c02 \u0c1a\u0c47\u0c38\u0c4d\u0c24\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c41 \u0c35\u0c47\u0c1a\u0c3f \u0c1a\u0c42\u0c21\u0c3e\u0c32\u0c3f \u0c1c\u0c48 \u0c36\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c40\u0c30\u0c3e\u0c02\u2026 \u0c05\u0c02\u0c1f\u0c47 \u0c05\u0c2f\u0c4b\u0c27\u0c4d\u0c2f \u0c05\u0c02\u0c24\u0c1f\u0c3e \u0c36\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c40\u0c30\u0c3e\u0c2e \u0c39\u0c28\u0c41\u0c2e\u0c3e\u0c28\u0c4d \u0c06\u0c28\u0c35\u0c3e\u0c33\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c41\u201d\n\nIt has been circulating on WhatsApp as well.\n\nThe social media claim is false. The idol has not been recovered from Ayodhya, but from a site in Madhya Pradesh. Upon reverse-searching the image, Alt News found it in a news report by the Hindi publication Patrika. The report of July 2019 states that the idol was found in the village of Barkhedi Abdulla in Bhopal district of MP.\n\nThe report also contains a similar image to the one which has been shared widely as the recovery of a Hanuman idol at the site of the five acres allotted to the Sunni Waqf Board. Alt News found these images on another website, Samachar of India. This report too is of July 2019. Alt News spoke to Suresh Damle, CSP Ayodhya Nagar, Bhopal who confirmed that the idol was indeed recovered from the village of Barkhedi Abdulla in July 2019, but refused to elaborate on the incident.\n\nIt may thus be noted that the image of a Hanuman idol shared as \u201cfound during digging at the site allotted to the Sunni Waqf Board in Ayodhya\u201d, is actually from Bhopal district in MP.", "lang": "en"}
