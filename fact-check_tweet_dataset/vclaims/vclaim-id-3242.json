There are several documented cases of broadband providers blocking or slowing down applications. The FCC in 2008 found that Comcast had violated one of the commission\u2019s Internet policies by blocking some users\u2019 peer-to-peer file-sharing connections in an effort to manage network traffic. (Comcast no longer manages traffic like this; its network management policies are posted online.)", "lang": "en"}
