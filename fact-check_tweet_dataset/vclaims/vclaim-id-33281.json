Cory Booker say he\u2019s \u201csick and tired of the Constitution \u2026 manipulating everything we do\u201d?\n\n\n\nA: No. That viral quote was lifted from a satirical story.\n\nThe satirical Christian website the Babylon Bee poked fun at Senate Democrats in a June story about lawmakers\u2019 supposed resistance to something they felt possessed undue influence over conservative judges: the Constitution.\n\n\u201cStill reeling from Trump\u2019s previous Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, Democrats plan to scrutinize any new nominee to ensure that he or she isn\u2019t yet another crony of something called \u2018The Constitution,\u2019 Senate Democrats announced Friday,\u201d begins the tongue-in-cheek article, published days before President Donald Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\n\nBut some on social media have used the content to blur the lines between fact and fiction. Specifically, a viral meme shared on Facebook in recent days targets Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey by using an illogical quote from the story.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sick and tired of the Constitution sitting in the National Archives, manipulating everything we do,\u201d the meme reads, attributing the quote to Booker. For additional effect, the meme adds a photo of a talking Booker and CNN\u2019s logo.\n\nBut Booker, considered a potential presidential candidate in 2020, didn\u2019t say that. The quote comes from the Babylon Bee\u2019s fictional account.\n\nThe meme was published on multiple Facebook pages, with each post earning thousands of shares \u2014 and scores of comments of condemnation.\n\n\u201cDemocrats HATE Our U.S. Constitution,\u201d is how a page called \u201cRepublican Patriotic Party\u201d started an Oct. 4 post about the meme. \u201cNo Mr. Booker, The Constitution is there to Govern what Our Elected Officials Do, and You have Sworn to Uphold and Protect it! Traitorous Maggot!\u201d\n\nThat post, which garnered more than 7,000 shares, attracted the attention of users who called Booker a \u201ccriminal and a hypocrite\u201d \u2014 and called for him to step down.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cSenate Democrats Demand Supreme Court Nominee Not Be Unduly Influenced By U.S. Constitution.\u201d The Babylon Bee. 9 Oct 2018.", "lang": "en"}
