No, that's not true: that story originated on a military themed satire website, if you read it anywhere else you should know it came from there and it is not real.\n\nThe supposed defection was reported in an article published on April 30, 2018 by Duffel Blog which was titled \"Kim Jong-un defects to South Korea\" (archived here) and which opened:\n\nPANMUNJOM, South Korea -- Friday's summit between North and South Korea came to an unexpected halt after North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un used his brief landmark visit to South Korea to defect across the demilitarized zone, sources confirmed today. Kim crossed the border surrounded by numerous bodyguards and handlers. When this group briefly departed to enable a photo with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, Kim furtively glanced around before dashing at a startled Moon, screaming \"I wish to defect!\" Sources close to the U.S. and South Korean governments say Mr. Kim is freely talking about his life as what he calls, \"a modern slave,\" imprisoned in the North for more than 30 years.\n\nWhile the peace talks and historical meeting with the South Korean leader are real enough (as incredible as that may have sounded a few years ago) the defection did not happen.\n\nThe website Duffelblog.com is a military-themed satire website which sports following legal disclaimer on its 'about' page:\n\nWe are in no way, shape, or form, a real news outlet.
