And now, the idols will be returned to Lord Ram's birthplace at Ayodhya.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that both pictures are indeed from Sri Sadguru Samartha Narayana Maharaj Ashram in Harihar city of Karnataka's Davanagere district. However, there is no credible evidence to establish the authenticity to the claim that these idols were brought from Ayodhya at the time of Mughal emperor Babur.\n\nThe claim, along with the photos, is circulating on WhatsApp. Some have also shared it on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nDuring the investigation, we found both images in a photo gallery of Kannada Times.\n\nAccording to \"Kannada Times\", these images are from Sri Sadguru Samartha Narayana Maharaj Ashram in Harihar and clicked by Chinmaya.M.Rao. AFWA delved deeper into the images:\n\nThis photo shows the idols of Lord Ram, Lakshman and Sita made up of metal. We reached out to a member of the ashram's working committee, Purushottam Gupta, who said, \"These idols are moved out in the ashram's hall area for public offerings and pujas during festivities. Most likely, they are not more than 70-80 years old. The claim that they had been brought from Ayodhya centuries ago is not right.\"\n\nWe also showed the above photo to Ashok Shettar, a retired professor from the department of history and archaeology at Karnataka University. He too said that the claim of these idols being brought from Ayodhya is \"bogus\".\n\nWe then spoke to Satyendra Das, a court-authorised priest at Ayodhya's Ram temple, who denied having heard of the viral story ever.\n\nHe pointed out that the Ram Janmabhoomi temple is dedicated to \"Ram Lalla\", i.e. Ram as a child. Therefore, one would find idols of Lord Ram, Lakshman, Bharat and Shatrughan in the makeshift tent at the disputed site, but no idol of his wife Sita. He argued that since the viral photo also has an idol of Sita, hence it is unlikely to be from Ayodhya.\n\nThis photo shows black stone idols of Lord Ram, Lakshman and Sita. Regarding this photo, ashram working committee member Purushottam Gupta told us, \"After the Ayodhya verdict, some locals started believing that these idols were brought from Ayodhya. However, there is no evidence to that effect. These idols date further back and are placed in the ashram's sanctum sanctorum.\"\n\nIndia Today TV also spoke to a senior journalist in Davanagere, Mohammed Nazir, who said he had never heard of this viral story before the Supreme Court verdict on Ayodhya.\n\n\"Here in Davanagere, after the verdict, people started believing that the stone idols were brought from Ayodhya. As both the images are from the same place, social media users are sharing the same claim with the photo of metal idols too,\" he added.\n\nWe then reached out to Davanagere district magistrate Mahantesh Belagi, who said that looking at the renewed interest of people in the stone idols, he now plans to get them examined by Archaeological Survey of India experts and historians.\n\nRegarding the stone idols, Ayodhya priest Satyendra Das told us that though they look quite old it is difficult to say that these idols were taken to Harihar from Ram Janambhoomi.\"\n\nFrom the above evidence, India Today TV concluded that the debate over Ayodhya's original idols is regarding the stone ones, but with both sets of idols from the same ashram, some people are also sharing the metal idols with the viral claim that they were brought to safety just before Babur demolished Ram Janambhoomi.\n\nHowever, till now, we could not find that any proof which ascertains that the idols were brought from Ayodhya hundreds of years ago. It is also to be noted that the viral post started circulating only after the Supreme Court's verdict on the Ayodhya land. However, till the time there is an official report by ASI or any archaeological expert on this matter, it is difficult to dismiss the claim either.", "lang": "en"}
