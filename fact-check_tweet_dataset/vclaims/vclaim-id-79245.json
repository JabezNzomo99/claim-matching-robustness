The Dallas Morning News reported: \u201cHernandez was accused only in the 2017 election. He visited a woman in April 2017 and took her blank absentee ballot. He filled it out and forged her signature before mailing it in, court records show. The woman contacted the district attorney\u2019s office about the incident. She identified Hernandez from a photo lineup.\u201d\n\nThe Post reported that \u201cthe assistant district attorney on that case said Barr\u2019s description doesn\u2019t match the facts\u201d and that the 700 ballots in the Dallas race were not all cast for one candidate. Kupec said in a statement for that article: \u201cPrior to his interview, the Attorney General was provided a memo prepared within the Department that contained an inaccurate summary about the case which he relied upon when using the case as an example.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot only are there bar codes on the ballot, but the ballot won\u2019t be accepted unless it is from a registered voter, whose name and signature are verified by elections officials,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat would be the point of a counterfeit ballot if it will be counted only if it comes from a real voter? The two principal reasons mail-in ballots are not accepted is that they arrive late or that election officials conclude the signature on the ballot doesn\u2019t match the one on file for the voter. I don\u2019t see how a counterfeit ballot gets around the voter verification process.\u201d\n\nA statement from the Carter Center, issued in May, says: \u201cThe commission\u2019s main recommendations on vote-by-mail and absentee voting were to increase research on vote-by-mail (and early voting) and to eliminate the practice of allowing candidates or party workers to pick up and deliver absentee ballots. Fortunately, since 2005, many states have gained substantial experience in vote-by-mail and have shown how key concerns can be effectively addressed through appropriate planning, resources, training, and messaging.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
