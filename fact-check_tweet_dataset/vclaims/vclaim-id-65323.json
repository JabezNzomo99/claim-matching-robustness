The Prop. 205 cap is 147 dispensaries,\" Humble said.\n\nAccording to Humble, the agency could also add an undetermined number of new stores to \"meet demand\" in 2021.\n\nBarrett Marson, a spokesman with the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, a pro-marijuana group, said there is \"certainly growth\" for new licenses in the initiative.\n\nMoreover, according to the initiative\u2019s language, the new agency would not set rules on recreational marijuana until September 2017.\n\nThe ad claims Prop. 205 \"blocks market entry for new dispensaries.\"\n\nWhile the ballot language does give an upper hand to existing medical marijuana dispensaries, it does not completely block a new dispensary from entering a legal recreational marijuana market.\n\nWe rate the ad\u2019s claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
