The report included copies of the man\u2019s passport, his contract with Wagner and other documents proving his identity.\n\nKremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov commented on the Novaya Gazeta investigation the day it was published, saying the Russian presidential administration had seen neither the video nor the newspaper\u2019s report. Peskov said the matter had \u201cnothing to do with the Russian military\u201d and that any \u201cfears about our reputation are groundless.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president cannot make decisions regarding such companies, it is simply impossible,\u201d Peskov insisted.\n\nWagner is Russia\u2019s most famous private military company, and is reportedly named after its commander, Dmitry Utkin, a former Russian military intelligence (GRU) officer who used the nom de guerre Wagner during his service in Chechnya.\n\nWagner is active in eastern Ukraine, Syria, and several countries in Africa and Latin America.\n\nApart from his position running Wagner, Utkin is chief executive of a company called Concord Management and Consulting LLC.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department indicted Concord and its owner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, in February 2018 as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections.\n\nCommenting on the Concord Management and Consulting LLC indictment, Russian President Vladimir Putin said: \u201cWe heard accusations against the company Concord. \u2026 and the accusations against it just fell apart in a U.S. court.\u201d Polygraph.info earlier found that claim to be false.\n\nPrigozhin is the Russian president\u2019s close confidant and has often been described as \u201cPutin\u2019s chef\u201d because his firms provide food delivery and catering services to the Kremlin.\n\nU.S. prosecutors say Prigozhin is a leading figure in the Kremlin propaganda and disinformation campaigns that are part of its hybrid warfare strategy. His companies finance and own the St. Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency, a.k.a. the \u201ctroll factory,\u201d which was also indicted by the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nIn 2012, Putin, who was then serving as Russia\u2019s prime minister, described PMCs as \u201can instrument for the realization of national interests without the direct participation of the state.\u201d\n\nIn a Kremlin ceremony on Dec. 9, 2016, Putin, who was again serving as president, awarded state medals and orders to Russian military personnel who had served in Syria. Among those who received the Order of Courage was Dmitry Utkin, who was at the time not a Russian Defense Ministry service member, but a retired private business owner.\n\nThe Kremlin confirmed Utkin\u2019s appearance at the ceremony, but declined to provide any details on why he was awarded.\n\nDuring his end-of-the-year news conference in Moscow on December 20, 2018, Putin said: \u201cNow about \u2018Wagner\u2019 and what people are doing: everyone should stay within the framework of the law, everyone. We can ban the private security business altogether, but once we do that, I think you will get a lot of petitions to protect this labor market.\"\n\nPutin added: \u201cAs for their presence somewhere abroad, if, I repeat again, they do not violate Russian law, they have the right to work and push their business interests anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nPutin again spoke about the PMCs during \u201cDirect Line,\u201d his annual televised Q&A call-in, on June 20, 2019.\n\n\u201cAs for private companies, including private security companies \u2026 and they are really present there (Syria), this is not the Russian state, and they are not participants in combat, unfortunately or fortunately,\" Putin said.\n\nPolygraph.info obtained proof of Wagner\u2019s military activities in Syria, after a February incident in which hundreds were reported killed by U.S. troops who came under attack.\n\nOfficially, private military companies are illegal in Russia. Under Putin, the country has dropped out of international initiatives aimed at regulating them.\n\nThe Kremlin benefits enormously by maintaining a fuzzy status for PMCs, experts told the congressional U.S. Helsinki Commission during a Nov. 6 hearing titled \u201cPutin\u2019s Shadow Warriors.\u201d\n\n\u201cRussian PMCs are the tool of the government, which benefits include plausible deniability,\u201d said the Rand Corporation\u2019s Dara Massicot.", "lang": "en"}
