Lindsey Graham of South Carolina that would allow reserve troops to enroll in Tricare, a Defense Department managed health care program. (Statements on Clinton's Web site don't mention that she was one of many co-sponsors.)\n\nThe legislation didn't pass, but much of its substance was adopted in the 2007 defense authorization bill.\n\nThe tone of her ad suggests she was a key player in the passage of the bill, but the record indicates that Graham took the lead in the effort, and she was one of several supporters. So while it's fair for her to say she was an advocate for expanded benefits for Guard and Reserve members, the statement would be more accurate if it indicated she was one of many.", "lang": "en"}
