Stating that \u2018the sooner we bury this the better\u2019 \u2026. Developing.\"\n\nThe post was published on Feb. 20 and has since been shared nearly 3,000 times. It was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nKatie Hill, Obama\u2019s spokesperson, told us the claim was bogus.\n\n\"This internet rumor is completely absurd,\" she wrote in an email.\n\nThe rumor also showed up in a tweet on Feb. 19, with two pictures of Obama and Smollett side by side.\n\nNiether post provides any evidence beyond crediting it to \"sources say.\" There have been no credible media reports regarding Obama having talks with anyone involved in the Smollett case. While the Facebook post includes an image of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Obama\u2019s former White House chief of staff, leaning over to speak to Obama, we know that image to be at least 10 years old, according to a reverse image search on TinEye.com. Emanuel has publicly criticized Smollet\u2019s actions.\n\nSmollet has been charged with one felony count of disorderly conduct for filing a false police report. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson recently said there\u2019s more evidence \"that hasn\u2019t been presented yet that does not support his innocence.\" The producers of Empire announced Smollett will no longer appear on the show.\n\nClearly, it would be national news if a former president inserted himself in a high-profile case such as this one. There is no evidence that this has happened.\n\nThis claim is Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
