That\u2019s why certain people appear bright until you hear them speak.\u201d\n\nThe statement appears nowhere in Einstein\u2019s written works.\n\nEinstein famously put forward, along with other important contributions to the field of physics, the theory of special relativity, which suggests that objects can approach but not exceed the speed of light. (RELATED: Did Einstein Say That Technology Would Create A \u2018Generation Of Idiots\u2019?)\n\nWhile the theoretical physicist did discuss the speed of light in his writings, there is no evidence that Einstein authored this specific saying. A search of the Einstein Archive Online returned no results. It also doesn\u2019t appear in Alice Calaprice\u2019s \u201cThe Ultimate Quotable Einstein,\u201d which contains more than 1,000 verified sayings and quips from Einstein.\n\nThe earliest close match to the statement dates back to 1989, where it was published in a Delaware newsletter as part of a list of quips, according to the website Quote Investigator. It\u2019s unclear, however, whether it originated with Robert Orben or Gary Apple, who both served as editor of the newsletter, or another source altogether.\n\nEinstein has been credited with coining the saying since at least 2009, according to Quote Investigator.", "lang": "en"}
