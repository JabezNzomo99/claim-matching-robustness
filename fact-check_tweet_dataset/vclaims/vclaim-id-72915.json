And to my mind this security legislation does not impede that whatsoever.\u201d\n\nThis is not accurate.\n\nThere are at least two new powers that cover non-criminal offences: 1) information sharing among government bodies, and 2) disruption measures for Canada\u2019s spy agency, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS).\n\nThe bill defines an activity that undermines Canadian security in part 1, which introduces the Security of Canada Information Sharing Act. The purpose of this act is to \u201cencourage and facilitate\u201d information sharing among government bodies about \u201cactivities that undermine the security of Canada\u201d (section 3).\n\nThe word \u201ccriminal\u201d is not used in the definition of an activity that undermines the security of Canada, but the terms \u201clawful\u201d and \u201cunlawful\u201d are. One of the undermining activities is \u201cunduly influencing a government in Canada by force or unlawful means\u201d (section 2.(b)).\n\nThe definition only excludes \u201clawful advocacy, protest, dissent and artistic expression\u201d (section 2). That leaves \u201cunlawful\u201d activities, which is not the same thing as \u201ccriminal\u201d activities.\n\nCraig Forcese, a national security law expert who has written several backgrounders on bill C-51 with colleague Kent Roach, said in an email that \u201c\u2018unlawful\u2019 in practice means a lot more than [criminal], unless something in the statute defines it narrowly (and nothing does).\u201d\n\nFor example, an unlawful activity is a protest without the right city permit, or an unauthorized strike, said Forcese, who also pointed out in a recent blog that concerns about a too-wide definition of \u201clawful\u201d were hashed out over a decade ago during debate over the original Antiterrorism Act.\n\nThe proposed bill gives CSIS powers to disrupt threats to Canada\u2019s security in part 4, which introduces amendments to the CSIS Act. The agency \u201cmay take measures, within or outside Canada, to reduce the threat\u201d (section 12.1(1)). This moves CSIS beyond current duties of surveillance and intelligence gathering.\n\nTypes of disruption activities are not listed in the bill, apart from those that require a warrant, like measures that contravene the Charter or Canadian law, and those that are prohibited, like causing death or bodily harm, obstructing justice, and violating sexual integrity.\n\nWhat about the types of activities CSIS can disrupt? Those that count as a threat to Canada?\n\nThe definition above of an \u201cactivity that undermines the security of Canada\u201d is not to be confused with the definition of \u201cthreats to the security of Canada,\u201d which is found in the CSIS Act and is core to the agency\u2019s mandate, and which would not change under C-51.\n\nThe list of threats in the CSIS Act definition includes espionage, sabotage and acts of violence. Excluded is \u201clawful advocacy, protest or dissent\u201d but with the caveat \u201cunless carried on in conjunction\u201d with one of the listed threats, like espionage, sabotage, etc. (section 2).\n\nForcese and Roach point out this caveat is quite significant. In a backgrounder on C-51, they wrote that at present, \u201cthe exemption still allows CSIS to investigate many otherwise democratic activities with a loose and distant relationship to actual espionage, sabotage, foreign-influenced activities, political violence or terrorism or subversion.\u201d\n\nThe agency\u2019s new powers of disruption cover this same set of activities. Disruption would therefore not be restricted to criminal offences.\n\nIt is false to say that only criminal offences are within the scope of the bill. At least two new powers go further. Unlawful and some lawful activities could also be fair game.\n\nSee how we score.", "lang": "en"}
