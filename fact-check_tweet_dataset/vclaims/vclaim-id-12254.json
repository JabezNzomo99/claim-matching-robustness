This article is a fact check of the claims. What is the Blue Revolution?\n\nAs per a response in the Lok Sabha, \u2018Government of India has identified Fisheries as a key sector considering its immense potential for growth, to achieve economic prosperity and nutritional security by effective utilization of water resources in a sustainable manner. Accordingly, the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries has restructured the Central Plan Schemes by merging all fisheries schemes under an umbrella of Blue Revolution. The restructured Scheme on Blue Revolution: Integrated Development and Management of Fisheries approved in December, 2015 by the Government provides for a focused development and management of the fisheries sector to increase both fish production and fish productivity from aquaculture and fisheries resources. This includes both the inland and marine fisheries sector, including deep sea fishing with special focus on modern and innovative techniques. The objectives of the scheme are to\n\u2022 Increase the overall fish production in a responsible and sustainable manner for economic prosperity\n\u2022 Modernize the fisheries with special focus on new technologies\n\nThe Blue Revolution scheme also provides for Training, skill development and capacity building programmes for fishers, fish farmers and other The scheme also provides financial assistance for renovation of existing ponds, rejuvenation of urban/semi-urban/rural lakes/tanks for fish culture and establishment of fish hatcheries to ensure supply of quality seeds to fishers and fish farmers at an affordable rate towards enhancement of fish production.\u2019\n\nWhat is the outlay for Fisheries?\n\nThe first claim is that government has provided for \u2018integrated development and management of fisheries with an outlay of Rs. 3000 crores.\u2019\n\nAccording to the expenditure budget of 2018-19, the revised budget estimates for integrated development and management of fisheries for the year 2017-18 is Rs. 301.73 crores while for the year of 2018-19, it is Rs. 632.61 crores.\n\nThe actual expenditure on \u2018Blue Revolution\u2019 in 2016-17 is Rs. 387.81 crores. There was no allocation for \u2018integrated development and management of fisheries\u2019 as a separate head before 2017-18. In fact, this particular head is not seen in the previous year budget documents.\n\nThe following chart shows the actual expenditure of the fisheries department (allocations have been made under the name of blue revolution since 2012-13). The total expenditure during UPA-2 was Rs. 1631 crores and the expenditure during the current government (including 2018-19 budget estimates) is Rs. 1920 crores. These numbers do not add up to the figure of Rs. 3000 crores as mentioned in the infographic.\n\nThe second claim is that \u2018Fish production increased from 186.12 tonnes during 2012-14 to 209.59 tonnes during 2014-16\u2019. The numbers are odd since the production in the entire country will be a few lakh tonnes. Hence the assumption is that the numbers in the infographic mean lakh tonnes.\n\nAccording to one response in Lok Sabha, the fish production during the year 2012-13 was 9040.34 thousand tonnes or 90.4 lakh tonnes. In the following year of 2013-14, production increased to 95.78 lakh tonnes. The total production for the two years (2012-14) adds up to 186.18 lakh tonnes.\n\nAs per another answer in Lok Sabha, the fish production for the year 2014-15 was 102.6 lakh tonnes and for the year 2015-16 was 107.62 tonnes. Hence the total production for the years of 2014-16 was 210.2 lakh tonnes.\n\nBased on the annual report 2017-18 of the Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries, responses to Lok Sabha question 451, question 3796 and response to Rajya Sabha question 1763, the following chart is made. The chart shows production of fish in the country since 2004-05 in lakh tonnes.\n\nAs per official data, the increase in fish production during UPA-1 was 19%, was 25.7% during UPA-2 and 31.7% in the first four years of the current government. The data clearly suggests that the fish production increased substantially during the current government.\n\nThis story is part of a larger series on the 4-years of the Modi government.
