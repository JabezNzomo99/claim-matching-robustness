The video shows Jalandhar candidate Neetu Shutteran Wala tearing up on getting just five votes which is fewer than the nine members of his family.\n\nIn the video, Shutteran Wala begins crying during a conversation with a reporter as he narrates his tale of woe. Shutteran Wala contested as an Independent candidate.\n\nHere\u2019s how the conversation went.\n\nReporter: Santokh Singh Chaudhary is leading in Jalandhar seat, and we have with us an Independent candidate Neetu Shutteran Wala (turns to Wala) so only five people voted for you?\n\nShutteran Wala (tearing up almost immediately): Sir, despite having nine members in the family, I got only five votes.\n\nReporter: That means even your family members haven\u2019t voted for you.\n\nShutteran Wala: No sir, I think the fraud happened in the voting process.\n\nThe video spread like wildfire on social media. Even some newspapers and websites published reports based on it.\n\nAs per the website of Election Commission 856 people voted for Shutteran Wala in the final tally. It can be inferred, however, that the video was shot even as the count was on, and it may just have been that Shutteran Wala\u2019s kitty had just five votes by then.", "lang": "en"}
