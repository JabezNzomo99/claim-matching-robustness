His father worked as a real estate developer in New York City, and his mother, a Scottish immigrant, supported various charitable causes.\n\nThe Facebook post, which has been shared more than 230 times, shows the Trumps dressed in KKK robes while posing for a photo with their son, who\u2019s wearing a suit and red tie.\n\n\u201cMary and Fred Trump with son Donald in their KKK outfits, 1999,\u201d reads the caption.\n\nHowever, a reverse image search reveals that the original photograph, found on Shutterstock, has been manipulated. KKK robes have been digitally inserted over Fred and Mary Trump\u2019s regular clothing, and the background has been simplified. It also appears to have been flipped.\n\nShutterstock and another stock photo website also date the image back to the early 90s \u2013 not 1999, as the Facebook post claims.
