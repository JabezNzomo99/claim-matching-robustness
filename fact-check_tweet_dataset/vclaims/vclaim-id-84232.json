However, the top photo shows a copper mine in Chile and the majority of lithium is extracted from brine.\n\nThis meme contrasting a photo of an open-air mine with that of an oil sands rig was shared more than 172,000 times with the caption: \u201cThis is a mine where lithium is extracted for electric car batteries. This is an oilsands site in Alberta. Tell me more about how your electric car is better for the environment.\u201d\n\nThe post was shared by Saskatchewan Proud, a Facebook page that is part of a wider network of conservative-leaning Canadian Facebook pages, such as this one and this one, dedicated to issues at a provincial and federal level. Although the post was first shared in 2016, it continues to circulate.\n\nThe sheer size of the alleged lithium mine in a Mars-like landscape, compared with a relatively small oil rig surrounded by forests, seems to make a convincing point. However, the post is misleading.\n\nThe top photo shows La Escondida, the world\u2019s largest copper mine, owned by BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. Below is a photograph of the same mine from another angle.\n\nA flipped version of the photo featured in the meme was used often enough in reference to lithium mining that it is one of the first results for \u201clithium mine\u201d on Google Images.\n\nTo be sure, lithium mining is not an impact-free industry, but large open mines such as Escondida do not accurately reflect the way most lithium is extracted.\n\nAccording to this 2018 study, about two thirds of the world\u2019s lithium production is extracted from brine, in a chemically intensive process that evaporates on average half a million litres of brine per ton of lithium carbonate. Much of the world\u2019s lithium production comes from brine pools that look like the one pictured below, in Bolivia\u2019 Uyuni site.\n\n\u201cExtracting lithium from brine is generally more environmentally-friendly than hard rock (lithium mining), but there definitely are concerns with water consumption,\u201d Brian Jaskula, a United States Geological Survey lithium specialist told AFP by email.\n\nLithium is also extracted from ore processing, although the production is not comparable to that of Chile\u2019s Escondida copper mine. In Australia, Greenbushes, the world\u2019s largest hard rock lithium mine, currently produces about 80 kilotons (one thousand metric tons) of lithium carbonate equivalent annually. In 2018, BHP reported that La Escondida produced 1,213 kilotons of copper.\n\nThe meme\u2019s bottom photo does depict an oil sands site in Alberta -- MEG Energy\u2019s Christina Lake operation.\n\nHowever, using Google Maps\u2019 satellite view it is clear that the meme shows only a part of the Christina Lake operations. This satellite image shows the rig and two lakes visible in the meme\u2019s photo (circled in red), but it also makes it clear that there are additional rigs on the site.\n\nThe Christina Lake site uses Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) in order to recover bitumen lying too deep to be mined (over 75 metres). SAGD is the main method of extraction for in-situ production and requires the drilling of underground wells through an oil sands deposit, in order to continuously inject steam to fluidify bitumen and pump it to the surface.\n\nIn-situ extraction has a lower surface impact than open pit mining of oil sands, Steven Bryant, professor at University of Calgary\u2019s Department of Chemicals and Petroleum Engineering, told AFP in an email. However, studies have found that open pit mining leads to habitat loss and requires the building of tailings ponds that constitute an environmental hazard.\n\nIn Alberta, oil sands reserves accessible by in-situ techniques cover an area 50 times as large as allowed through open pit mining. Researchers at The Pembina Institute argued in this study that in-situ mining was in fact, \"significantly more damaging than conventional oil extraction methods,\u201d when considering forest clearing and its subsequent impact on wildlife.\n\nBryant told AFP the meme was far from an apples-to-apples comparison, arguing that \u201cin the context of the post, a full accounting would also consider the greenhouse gas emissions associated with electric vehicle production and operation vs the GHG emissions associated with oil production and consumption.\u201d\n\nExtraction of lithium and oil sands bitumen on a large scale are both detrimental to the environment. Although lithium mines do exist, they do not compare in size to Chile\u2019s Escondida copper mine.", "lang": "en"}
