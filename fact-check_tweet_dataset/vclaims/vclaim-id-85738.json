Here are some possible answers.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-02-13T08:00:39Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85738", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/02/13/whats-the-immigration-status-of-melania-trumps-parents/", "vclaim": "Still, a few days before the election in November, an Associated Press investigation revealed she was \u201cpaid for 10 modeling jobs in the United States worth $20,056 that occurred in the seven weeks before she had legal permission to work in the country, according to detailed accounting ledgers, contracts and related documents.\u201d Her visa at the time allowed her to be in the United States and look for work but not perform paid work.\n\nWildes told the AP that \u201cthese documents, which have not been verified, do not reflect our records including corresponding passport stamps\u201d but would not say anything more. The Trump campaign refused to comment. The article noted that \u201cit is highly unlikely that the discovery will affect the citizenship status of Mrs. Trump.\u201d\n\nAs for her parents, Viktor Knavs is a former member of the Yugoslav Communist Party who worked as the chauffeur for the mayor of his home town, Sevnica, and supposedly became a successful car salesman; other reports say he sold auto parts. He was born in 1944, making him two years older than the president. Amalija Knavs was a pattern maker at a textile factory. They are now said to be retired.\n\nAccording to various news reports, the Knavses have been living in the United States at least a year and probably much longer \u2014 possibly since the mid-2000s. Since Melania Trump moved into the White House, some reports have suggested they live there. Other reports have said they split their time between the D.C. area, Mar-a-Lago, Trump Tower and Bedminster, N.J. They apparently help take care of Barron Trump, the president\u2019s 11-year-old child.\n\nThey could be here on an IR-5 visa, meaning they are legal permanent residents because they are the parents of a U.S. citizen. Kevin Johnson, dean of the University of California at Davis Law School, believes this is the most likely option, even though the administration\u2019s immigration proposal would limit family visas to spouses and minor children of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, ending \u201cextended-family chain migration.\u201d\n\nOf course, using an immigration path that the president wants to eliminate would be politically explosive. So the easiest explanation could be that they are here on tourism visas and have asked for extensions. Generally, a tourist visa is given for about six months, and can be extended for up to a year.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty common,\u201d said Sarah Pierce, an immigration policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. \u201cIt is way more feasible or likely that they would use tourism visas.\u201d She noted that data from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services shows the approval rate for the I-539 form (which extends status for all types of nonimmigrant visas, not just tourists) is 86 percent.\n\nHowever, another immigration attorney cast doubt on this theory. \u201cAnyone here as a tourist cannot legally be helping to take care of grandchildren. Government considers that working in the U.S., and tourists are not authorized to work,\u201d she said, asking not to be identified. \u201cMany grandparents have been denied visitor visas because they innocently say they will be helping with the new baby\u2014when they are really thinking about just visiting with their child and grandchild.\u201d\n\nIndividuals who are outside the United States may be able to request parole into the United States based on humanitarian or significant public benefit reasons. There is no statutory or regulatory definition of significant public benefit. \u201cParole based on significant public benefit includes, but is not limited to, law enforcement and national security reasons or foreign or domestic policy considerations,\u201d USCIS says. \u201cWe exercise our discretion on a case-by-case basis.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would guess that the first lady\u2019s parents were paroled into the United States and did not have to apply for a visa,\u201d Kolken said. \u201cParole can be extended by the [Homeland Security] Department, or the period of parole could be for a lengthy period of time. If my parents are looking to move to the U.S., and if I were president, I would have them paroled and then file an I-130/485 and get them green cards.\u201d\n\nThis is the least likely possibility, but we thought we would mention it. An international student can remain in the country for as long as they go to school. In the case of the Knavses, for instance, they could attend a program to learn English as a second language. But they would be in violation of this visa if they provided childcare.\n\nTwo of these possibilities are politically troubling for the White House, while two are relatively benign. Frankly, the most logical possibility is that the Knavses have received legal permanent residence because they are parents of a U.S. citizen \u2014 and they may have had this status for years. For the president\u2019s policy preferences, that\u2019s also the most problematic option.", "lang": "en"}
