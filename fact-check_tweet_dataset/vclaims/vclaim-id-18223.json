But what Brexit deal are we talking about?\n\nThe legal route for a country to leave the EU is by triggering Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. It calls for the EU to \u201cnegotiate and conclude an agreement with that State, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal\u201d.\n\nThat agreement can\u2019t be vetoed by a single country, like Slovakia or Poland. It would go ahead if it were approved by 20 of the 27 remaining EU countries, so long as they also represent 65% of the EU population.\n\nBut it won\u2019t necessarily be the treaty that most people mean when they talk about a \u2018Brexit deal\u2019.\n\nThe Article 50 agreement is, according to many experts, about the terms of divorce. It might cover things like the pensions of UK citizens working in the EU; moving EU agencies based in London; and UK payments into the EU budget up to 2020.\n\nThese practical matters should be negotiated \u201ctaking account of the framework for [the UK\u2019s] future relationship with the Union\u201d. That implies two major agreements: one on the logistics of divorce, and another on trade. (More treaties might be necessary on other issues, like security.)\n\nIndividual countries could veto the terms of Britain\u2019s new relationship with the EU\n\nWhile the terms of divorce can be agreed with a majority vote, the terms of future EU-UK trade relations are very likely to need a unanimous vote.\n\nMost of the EU\u2019s free trade agreements require a unanimous vote of all EU governments and ratification by all member countries. That\u2019s because they tend to be \u2018mixed agreements\u2019, meaning that they cover some ground that the EU doesn\u2019t have power over.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s possible for the EU to negotiate a trade agreement that can\u2019t be vetoed, depending on what\u2019s in it. The EU court recently heard a case that will clarify how much power individual governments have to veto EU trade agreements. The outcome of that might change our conclusion.\n\nWhile some experts think that trade talks could, if all countries agreed, be folded into the Article 50 talks, that might mean that the resulting deal would be vulnerable to a veto.\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen, there\u2019s plenty of room for interpretation about what EU rules require in this unprecedented situation.", "lang": "en"}
