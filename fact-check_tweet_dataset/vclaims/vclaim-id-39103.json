He previously in the interview referred to stopping public gatherings as \u201cquite draconian.\u201d\n\nHowever, he says that his view is that \u201cit would be better if we take all the measures that we can now to stop the peak of the disease.\u201d\n\nThe exchange is as follows:\n\nPhilip Schofield: Is the delay essentially trying to spread this out so it doesn\u2019t all happen at once and overwhelm the NHS, and that you can actually delay it into perhaps the summer when it\u2019s a little bit quieter and the ordinary flu might have died down a wee bit, is that what you\u2019re doing?\n\n\n\nBoris Johnson: Well it\u2019s a very, very important question, and that\u2019s where a lot of the debate has been and one of the theories is, that perhaps you could take it on the chin, take it all in one go and allow the disease, as it were, to move through the population, without taking as many draconian measures. I think we need to strike a balance, I think it is very important, we\u2019ve got a fantastic NHS, we will give them all the support that they need, we will make sure that they have all preparations, all the kit that they need for us to get through it. But I think it would be better if we take all the measures that we can now to stop the peak of the disease being as difficult for the NHS as it might be, I think there are things that we may be able to do.\n\nYou can watch the full interview here.", "lang": "en"}
