But just plain common sense. Would you take sanitary napkins steeped in menstrual blood and walk into a friend\u2019s home? You will not. And do you think that it is respectful to do the same when you walk into the house of God? So that is the difference. I have a right to pray. I do not have the right to desecrate. That is my personal opinion,\u201d she said in Young Thinkers\u2019 Conference organised by ORF on October 23.\n\nSoon after, social media was brimming with those criticising Irani\u2019s remarks, which she claimed was \u201cfake news\u201d.\n\nSubsequently, several journalists pointed out to Irani that it was she who had fallen for fake news as no reports suggest that women entered Sabarimala with blood-soaked sanitary pads.\n\nBJP MP Smriti Irani\u2019s remark seemed to be the outcome of a rumour which claimed that activist Rehana Fatima carried a blood-soaked sanitary napkin in her \u2018Irumudikkettu\u2019 (a prayer offering to God) to Sabarimala.\n\nPro-BJP Kerala media outlet Janam TV gave birth to the grapevine, according toNewslaundry. In an article published on October 19, Janam TV made the aforestated claim which was subsequently viral on social media (1, 2, 3, 4).\n\nHowever, as with most rumours, its original version changed with progression. Subsequent to Irani\u2019s remark, several right-wing Twitter handles came to the Union Minister\u2019s defence and alleged that Fatima carried a soiled pad on her head.\n\nBut Irani, in her clarification, seemed to suggest that she hadn\u2019t fallen for misinformation. The minister tweeted that she was \u201cyet to find a person who \u2018takes\u2019 a blood-soaked napkin to \u2018offer\u2019 to anyone let alone a friend.\u201d\n\nThen why exactly did the Union Textile Minister make the remark in the first place at the youth conference?\n\nThere is no reasonable explanation for Smriti Irani\u2019s statement about blood-soaked sanitary napkins apart from the reference to the alleged incident involving Rehana Fatima. Moreover, there are no reported cases of women ever carrying soiled pads to temples, or anywhere else for that matter.\n\nWhen Alt News contacted Rehana Fatima, she brushed off the rumours as \u201cfake news\u201d and added that she wasn\u2019t visiting Sabarimala to protest, but to pray. We also contacted Kerala police for confirmation and they denied that any activist or woman carried a sanitary pad \u2013 used or unused \u2013 inside the temple.\n\nThe BJP MP seemed to imply in her tweet that she hadn\u2019t fallen for misinformation but her rhetorical clarification did little to exonerate her as there is no justification for merely mentioning that women might carry blood-soaked pads inside temples.\n\nMoreover, Irani\u2019s other statements were also an attempt to rationalise the religious impositions on women by drawing parallels with Zoroastrianism, which also disallows menstruating women from entering a fire temple. This further hinted at the Union Minister\u2019s stand against the entry of menstruating women in places of worship.\n\nAfter The Wire\u2019s Siddharth Varadarajan tweeted about Smriti\u2019s Irani\u2019s remark, Aaj Tak\u2019s Executive Director Sweta Singh came to her defence and tweeted that \u201ceven in the Vatican mini-skirts are not allowed\u201d. When Varadarajan pointed out that soiled sanitary napkins are thrown out by women and not carried on \u2018tours\u2019, Singh remarked that if Varadarajan was unaware of the \u2018tour\u2019 Smriti Irani was referring to, he should have refrained from commenting on the subject. Singh, however, failed to mention the \u2018tour\u2019 she was talking about.\n\nDespite police statements clarifying that no such incident of carrying sanitary pads \u2013 used or unused \u2013 took place, the Executive Director of one of the most popular news organisations seemed to have fallen for the same misinformation as Smriti Irani.\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s Union Cabinet has 26 ministers, out of which only four are women. As one among this meagre number, Smriti Irani\u2019s recent statements set a dangerous precedent as her views may be seen as a barometer to the government\u2019s approach toward women\u2019s issues. She not only seemingly fell for a social media rumour but used the misinformation to further her stand against the entry of menstruating women in Sabarimala.", "lang": "en"}
