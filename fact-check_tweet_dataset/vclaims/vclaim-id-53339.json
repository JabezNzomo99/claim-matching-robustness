One post says the \u201cautism community\u201d created the campaign.\n\nWhile some autistic trick or treaters may choose to carry a blue pumpkin, it\u2019s not clear whether or not the autism community widely supports the campaign.\n\nIf someone has a blue pumpkin it doesn't necessarily mean they are autistic (they have also been used to signal certain food allergies). Equally, someone not having a blue pumpkin shouldn\u2019t be taken to indicate that they aren't autistic.\n\nThe initiative seems to have started with a post last year from a mother who\u2019d used a blue pumpkin to signify that her son was autistic when he went out trick or treating. It was also reposted on the Facebook page of US charity Autism Speaks. The charity has long been associated with the colour blue, using it in its logo and range of campaigns. Both posts went viral and, in the run-up to Halloween, the blue buckets have been embraced by some. \n\n \n\n However, some people in the autism community have rejected the campaign due to its connection with Autism Speaks. The charity is the subject of controversy in the community for its descriptions of autism as a \u201cdisaster\u201d and in need of a cure.", "lang": "en"}
