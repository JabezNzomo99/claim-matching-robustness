Kashmiri youth pelting stones at tourists\u2019 cars \u2013 translated). This message is currently circulating on social media along with a video showing rioters attacking cars on a street. It has been claimed that the incident occurred in Kashmir when a group of youth began pelting stones at cars of tourists visiting the valley on vacation.\n\nThe video has been widely shared on Facebook by both individual users and pages. Identical text has been used multiple times by numerous individual users, suggesting that the video may be circulating on WhatsApp too.\n\nThe video is of Switzerland\n\nThis is the same video which Alt News had earlier debunked in an article published on May 29. We broke up the video into individual frames with InVid software for videos, and reverse searched the image via Google. A video demonstration of the fact-check can be seen below. We found that the incident in question had occurred at Birsstrasse in Basel, Switzerland on May 19, 2018 after supporters of the Basel and Lucerne football clubs came to blows.\n\nTwo of the Facebook pages \u2013Dongi AAPand Jammu Mission\u2013 that have circulated the video have a combined membership of nearly 2 lakh people and more than 5,000 individuals have shared the video only from these two pages.\n\nThe video was earlier shared on social media with different claims. One version states that the incident had occurred in Birmingham, U.K when members of the Muslim community resorted to vandalism as they wanted to \u2018eat on the roads\u2019, in a reference to the practice of breaking fast during Ramadan.\n\nAccording to another version, this video has been shared by a YouTube channel RedeBrasil.NET with the claim that this vandalism took place in Brazil. It was also shared along with a set of gruesome images which falsely claimed that a gang of 15-20 people are on an abduction and killing spree in Jharkhand, Odisha and Bihar, attacking vehicles under the cover of darkness.\n\nNow, yet another context has been imagined for this video and shared widely with the objective of inciting suspicion and hatred among communities. This not only points to a pattern in which fake news is floated on social media but also shows that how thousands are still in the dark about the origin of the video. This is further exacerbated by the fact that such misinformation primarily relies on impulse and needs only a click to be shared further.", "lang": "en"}
