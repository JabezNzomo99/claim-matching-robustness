No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to educate gullible Trump supporters and Republicans about the need to actually click and read links before sharing or liking them in order to avoid being embarrassed by fans of the site later. All the events described in the article are not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on December 17, 2018 titled \"BREAKING: Colin Kaepernick Arrested In Massive $200k Drug Bust\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nLiberal hero Colin Kaepernick loves to \"kneel\" when he's making a scene about our \"racist\" country. But we're pretty sure he didn't like being forced to kneel by the Las Vegas police on Sunday. Kaepernick was arrested at the home of Marvin \"Big G\" Kirkpatrick after a neighbor called in a tip about \"loud music and possible drug activity.\" Police responded at 8:67 PM according to the Las Vegas Reporter. When they knocked at the door, someone inside was heard yelling \"Oh **** it's the cops! Hide the drugs!\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail, guaranteeing some would like and share it in their excitement without reading it first:\n\nHad they done so they would have seen several hints the story was false, for example the phrase \"Information you probably shouldn't trust\" in the site header and the category the post was published under (\"SATIRICAL SCANDALS THAT SOUND REAL\").\n\nThe photo illustrating the article doesn't even show Kaepernick but a protester being arrested in 2017 in St. Louis:\n\nLinks in the story that supposedly go to news articles related to the events instead go to articles mocking conservatives and conservative beliefs.\n\nThis is not the first time the site uses Kaepernick in a story with a similar purpose, only last week it published one accusing him of domestic violence:\n\nThe site comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including potatriotpost.us, dailyworldupdate.us and nofakenewsonline.us. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nBlair and his operation were profiled by the Washington Post on November 17, 2018 by Eli Saslow:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes wearethellod.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
