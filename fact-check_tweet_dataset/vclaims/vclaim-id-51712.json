But there were problems with this design, and later the government announced it would be going in a different direction, and \u201ctaking forward a solution that brings together the work on our app and the Google/Apple solution.\u201d\n\nThis Google/Apple solution is a decentralised system the two companies worked on together and released to help governments use Bluetooth data to build tracing apps.\n\nAs of August 2020, this app is currently on trial in Newham, the Isle of Wight and for NHS volunteer responders in England.\n\nSo although media reports that the government u-turned on its app or abandoned it in its previous form are not wrong, claiming that the app in general has been \u201cquietly binned\u201d is not correct.\n\nHow much has the app cost?\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that the app alone has cost the government \u00a3300 million as the post claims. According to the parliamentary under secretary of state for innovation, Lord Bethell, as of 30 June 2020 the app had cost \u00a310.8 million. This figure is based on the spend for developing and hosting the app, plus other costs like evaluating it.\n\nThe figure was reported on 25 June, just after the government announced it was changing track and going with a Google/Apple decentralised app, on 18 June. So it may well have cost more by now, but it seems extremely unlikely it would have reached \u00a3300 million.\n\nThe confusion may have come from the fact that in May, the government announced a \u00a3300 million funding package for local authorities to support test and trace services in general across England. The app is only one part of the test and trace effort.", "lang": "en"}
