Having a caricature that resembles Prime Minister Narendra Modi, text superimposed on the viral post says it was drawn by American cartoonist Ben Garrison.\n\nMany Facebook users have shared the cartoon, titled \u201cLipstick on a Pig\u201d, which shows some piglets feeding from a pig. While the piglets have names of news channels on them, the face of the pig resembles that of PM Modi. Behind, a dog is seen with \u201cBhagwat\u201d written on it. Text superimposed on the post says, \u201cAmerican cartoonist Ben Garrison\u2019s depiction of the state of Indian media today\u201d.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the viral image to be morphed. It was not created by American cartoonist Ben Garrison. His original work, titled \u201cLipstick on a Pig\u201d, depicted Hillary Clinton and her alleged crimes. Garrison has denied making any cartoon on the Indian media.\n\nWith the help of reverse image search, we found this cartoon has been circulating on the Internet since 2017.\n\nThree years back, several users had tweeted the viral image as well. We found the original cartoon was tweeted by its creator, Ben Garrison, on March 8, 2016.\n\nIn his tweet, the cartoonist had given a weblink, where he wrote in details that his creation of \u201cLipstick on a Pig\u201d was targeted at Hillary Clinton.\n\nComparing the two cartoons, it is evident that the viral one is morphed.\n\nIn September 2017, several Twitter users had posted the viral image and asked Garrison if it was fake.\n\nGarrison, in a reply tweet on October 23, 2017, said, \u201cNo- I have never drawn any cartoons on India politics- there are some cartoons with my sig going around- Not mine\u201d.\n\nThe entire works of Garrison can be on his website, here.\n\nEarlier, another cartoon on Indian politics had gone viral, falsely attributing it to Ben Garrison. We do not know who exactly created the morphed image, but it is confirmed that the viral post with the cartoon referring to Indian media has been falsely attributed to the American cartoonist,", "lang": "en"}
