We don\u2019t like what we see,\u201d screen captures of the alleged messages read. \u201cStop. You cannot imagine the consequences of your actions.\u201d\n\nThe FAN said that experts had determined the messages were of American origin due to syntactic and grammatical tells indicative of American English.\n\nIn an unclear reference, the FAN said it called an individual whom it identified, without explanation, as the \u201cmythical American Lieutenant Gibson\u201d.\n\nIn an ensuing video posted to YouTube, the supposed American, speaking in heavily accented English, denies being Lieutenant Gibson, claiming he \u201cisn\u2019t serving in our group.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to identify himself, the respondent claims to be the military adviser of \u201cthe consulate,\u201d adding \u201ccommander is not here.\u201d Seconds after giving his position, \u201cthe American\u201d then says he\u2019s \u201dnot at liberty\u201d to say who he is, adding it\u2019s \u201ca state secret.\u201d\n\nThe FAN report adds the situation appears to be \u201ca farce,\u201d but that it \u201cis not joking.\u201d\n\nWhat is true is that the U.S. Cyber Command is now targeting Russian operatives who it has identified as trying to influence the U.S. mid-term elections. CNN revealed the operation, citing a Trump administration official, who said that Cyber Command is targeting Russian hackers, \u201capparently overwhelming them with electronic messages and fake e-mails\u201d to stymie their efforts at influencing the upcoming U.S. vote.\n\n\"It's very interesting now, seeing this being part of U.S. cyber strategy, to go to these Russian operators, and saying, 'Don't influence these elections. We know who you are, we are tracking you, there will be consequences,\" Jason Healey, a former White House cyber official says in a quote in the CNN article.\n\nWhether or not the screen-grabs presented in the FAN report are authentic or were created to mirror the language in U.S. media reports remains unknown.\n\nBut the alleged phone call posted to YouTube is obviously \u201ca hilariously fake call,\u201d said Bellingcat\u2019s lead digital researcher, Aric Toler, in a mocking tweet.\n\nAs reported by BBC Russia (and available here in English) the troll factory, known as the Internet Research Agency had previously faked a video showing a U.S. soldier shooting at a Koran.\n\nIn an equally inept effort, the Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda published what it called a leaked recording between two CIA agents planning the downing of Malaysia Airlines MH17 over Ukraine in July 2014, replete with stilted language and wavering accents.\n\nThat effort, like the latest \u201caudio\u201d recording released by the FAN, was clearly fake.", "lang": "en"}
