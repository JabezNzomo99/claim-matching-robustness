After this, a question which is presently stirring the Bengal politics is - who destroyed the statue?\n\nMeanwhile, some pictures went viral on social media claiming that CCTV footage revealed Muslim TMC workers vandalised the statue of Vidyasagar.\n\nIn the photos, some men can be seen destroying a white statue.\n\nIndia Today's Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the viral photos have nothing to do with the statue of Vidyasagar.\n\nThe photos are from Iraq and the people seen in the pictures are Islamic State (IS) militants.\n\nApart from Facebook, this misleading post is also being shared widely on Twitter.\n\nA simple reverse search cleared the air around the viral photos. We found a CNN news report published in March, 2015, which used these viral photos.\n\nAs per the report, IS had destroyed some ancient statues and artifacts in Northern Iraq.\n\nThe photos and videos of the vandalism made headlines back then as well.\n\nMoreover, if one was to compare the broken statue of Vidyasagar with the viral photos, one can easily figure out the difference between the places of both the incidents.\n\nOnly investigations can reveal who vandalised the statue of Vidyasagar, but for now we can say that these viral photos are neither of Vidyasagar's statue being vandalised nor are they from India.", "lang": "en"}
