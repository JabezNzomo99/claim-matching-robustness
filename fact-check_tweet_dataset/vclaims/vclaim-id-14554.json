We must raise awareness around harm reduction.\u201d\n\nThe Foundation for a Smoke-Free World is a non-profit organisation. It is\n\nby one of the biggest\n\nsuch as e-cigarettes and vaporisers.\n\nThe foundation\u2019s communication manager, Nicole Bradley, told Africa Check the statistics came from their\n\nThe survey asked more than 17,000 adults from 13 different countries about how often they smoked, their attempts to quit and whether they had ever heard of or used smoke-free products.\n\nIn South Africa, 1,000 people older than 18 were interviewed face-to-face from 29 November to 11 December 2017 in five unspecified regions.\n\nrepresent the entire adult population, but the interviews were done using\n\nWhen they were asked if they smoked tobacco products like cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos or pipes, 44.8% of the men and 27.5% of the women said they smoked them regularly, Bradley told Africa Check. Another 4.1% of men and 6.5% of women said that they smoked them occasionally.\n\nIssues with sampling and weighting of variables\n\nThis is much higher than previous estimates of smoking in South Africa. In a presentation about the poll results, the foundation itself\n\nThese showed that 31.4% of men and 6.5% of women older than 15 in South Africa smoked tobacco products. (\n\n\u201cThe most glaring problem with the State of Smoking poll is the small sample size in each country,\u201d Nicole Vellios, research officer at the\n\n, told Africa Check. \u201cIt is not possible to conduct a robust analysis at a national level on such a small sample.\u201d\n\n, also thought the South African sample size was \u201ctoo small to get a really accurate view of smoking. The reason for that... is that smoking prevalence differs widely by race, gender and location.\u201d\n\nMaking sure a survey represents all the country\u2019s population groups \u201cis absolutely necessary for any sampling in South Africa given the large racial inequalities, which extends to smoking as it does with many other behaviours or economies in South Africa\u201d, Blecher said. \u201cI don't think one can draw any inference on the population level smoking prevalence numbers without understanding how it was weighted by race.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that black people, South Africa\u2019s largest population group, smoked the least. One \u201c\n\nof black people older than 15 had ever smoked.\n\nThere were also wide differences between regions, Blecher said. For example, the HSRC study found that only\n\nof people older than 15 surveyed in Limpopo province had ever smoked, compared to\n\n\u201cIf you end up oversampling white, coloured or Indian people (because your sample is too heavily focused on urban areas, or English and Afrikaans speakers), your overall share of smokers will be higher,\u201d Blecher said.\n\nSouth Africa has \u201cvery good smoking prevalence estimates\u201d, Blecher said. He directed Africa Check to the\n\n. This is a project of the\n\nat the University of Cape Town.\n\nThe fifth round of\n\nwas done in 2017, when about 24,000 adults in South Africa were surveyed. It found that 35.7% of men and 8.1% of women older than 18 smoked cigarettes, Vellios said. (\n\nVellios said roughly one in five South African adults smoked, a trend that had stayed \u201cpretty flat\u201d over the past decade.\n\nConclusion: Better studies show that in South Africa, about a third of men and 10% of women smoke tobacco\n\nThe Foundation for a Smoke-Free World said its global State of Smoking survey for 2018 had found that 49% of men and 34.1% of women in South Africa regularly or occasionally smoked tobacco.\n\nThe foundation\u2019s survey only asked 1,000 people in South Africa about their smoking habits, and only using questionnaires in English or Afrikaans. Experts said this sample was too small to represent all the people in South Africa when it comes to smoking.\n\nMore thorough surveys \u2013 by the University of Cape Town and the Human Sciences Research Council \u2013 found that about one in three men and one in 10 women in South Africa smoke cigarettes or had smoked tobacco before. Overall, roughly 20% of the country\u2019s people are smokers.", "lang": "en"}
