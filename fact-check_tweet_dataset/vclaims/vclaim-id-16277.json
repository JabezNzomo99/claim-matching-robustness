It acts as a disincentive for us to build and for people to move.\u201d \u201cDear @FullFact - have you ever looked at claim, repeated on @BBCNews last night, that UK \"has highest property taxes in the world\"?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that the UK government takes a higher proportion of GDP and a higher proportion of tax revenue in property taxes than any other developed country. But this statistic doesn\u2019t tell us how much of a drag property taxes put on the UK housing market.\n\nTo start with, the OECD\u2019s definition of \u2018total property taxes\u2019 includes \u2018recurrent taxes on immovable property\u2019, like council tax, which don\u2019t generally have a big impact on people\u2019s ability to buy and sell homes.\n\nPeople buying homes in the UK do have to pay stamp duty, which makes up 2.4% of the UK\u2019s total tax revenue according to the OECD. That\u2019s a relatively high proportion by international standards. Only Korea, Turkey and Italy seem to levy a higher proportion of their tax revenue through stamp duty (although the category we\u2019re using also includes charges on some non-housing transactions, so the comparison isn\u2019t exact).\n\nLooking at the overall take as a proportion of tax revenue doesn\u2019t tell us the rates that particular individuals and companies pay, or how that affects their behaviour when it comes to buying and selling property. The UK doesn\u2019t seem to have the highest rates of tax in the world for individual property transactions, and Scotland has its own system. We haven\u2019t found a source that comprehensively compares the rates on individual property transactions in different tax systems.\n\nAnd it\u2019s hard to draw easy conclusions from international comparisons without having a decent understanding of how different tax systems work in different countries, and how the burden falls on different parts of society.\n\nThat said, there is a debate about whether stamp duty should be changed or abolished in the UK. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has argued that there is little theoretical defence for it in the past.", "lang": "en"}
