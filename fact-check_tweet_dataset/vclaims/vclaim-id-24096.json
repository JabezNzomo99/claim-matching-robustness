The claim is misleading; the Japanese TV show was actually discussing the length of a meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Jokowi.\n\nThe video has been shared repeatedly on Facebook, for example this July 1, 2019, Facebook post, and on YouTube, for example here, where it has been watched more than 5,700 times.\n\nA similar version shared here on Twitter, where it has been viewed more than 18,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe Facebook post's Indonesian-language caption translates to English as: \u201cThere is a local TV station in Japan that \u2018for fun \u2019 counts the duration of speeches of state leaders at the G20 Summit\u2026\n\n Funny enough, there is a leader whose speech only lasted for one minute and it became a laughing stock of the programme\u2019s presenter and guests. \u200bThe country of origin of the leader is Indonesia! What a shame...\u201d\n\nOn the top left corner of the Facebook video, which has been viewed at least 1,100 times, there is an Indonesian-language text that says: \u201cThe president who is the pride of tadpoles. An embarassment to my country.\u201d\n\nThe G20 meeting in Osaka was held from June 28 to June 29, 2019, and was attended by leaders of the world\u2019s major economies, including Jokowi. Here is an AFP report about the event.\n\nThis Jakarta Post report published on June 28, 2019, states Jokowi attended the event.\n\n\u201cTadpoles\u201d is a nickname given to Jokowi\u2019s supporters. Here is a Jakarta Post article about the nickname.\n\nThe claim in the posts is misleading; the video actually shows the Japanese television show panellists discussing the duration of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s meeting with Jokowi during the G20 summit.\n\nThe footage has been captured from a broadcast of Japanese TV show New Joho 7 Days Newscaster.\n\nThis video, published on YouTube on June 29, 2019, shows the same segment as seen in the first misleading post, from the six-minute, five-second mark until the seven-minute, three-second mark.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the first misleading post (L) and the YouTube video (r):\n\nDuring this segment of the programme, presenter Shinichiro Azumi holds up a board with a list that shows the names of G20 leaders whom Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met or was planning to meet during the summit.\n\nSitting on the far left of the screen is comedian and actor Takeshi Kitano, and on the right is freelance broadcaster Takae Mikumo and the Tokyo bureau chief for the Wall Street Journal, Peter Landers.\n\nThe segment translates to English as:\n\nAzumi: \u201cDuring the G20 held in Osaka, Abe did a great job while having a tight schedule of talks to leaders from many countries. It\u2019s a pity that there\u2019s no talk with the South Korean leader. When it comes to Indonesia \u2019s President Joko, it was only one minute. And they supposedly discussed and affirmed an economic partnership agreement.\u201d\n\nMikumo: \u201cThere must have been translators, too.\u201d\n\nAzumi: \u201cIt must have been a very brief exchange.\u201d\n\nAzumi: \u201cPlease let us continue working together on the economy. Let us remain friendly.\u201d\n\nKitano: \u201cYou say all that, and that's all the time you have. \u201d\n\nAzumi: \u201cSo you can see how busy people are at the G20\u2026\u201d\n\nThe panellists can then be heard laughing intermittently during the discussion.\n\nThe Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued this statement about the meeting between Abe and Jokowi on June 28, 2019.\n\nThe first two sentences of the statement read: \u201cOn June 28, Mr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, held a pull aside talk with H.E. Mr. Joko Widodo, President of the Republic of Indonesia, who is visiting Japan to attend G20 Osaka Summit. Both leaders confirmed the completion of the General Review of the Japan-Indonesia Economic Partnership Agreement, and decided to continue the negotiation to amend the Agreement based on the outcomes of the General Review, aiming to conclude it by the end of this year.\u201d\n\nAccording to this Detik.com report on July 2, 2019, Febrian A. Ruddyard, the director general for multilateral cooperation at the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that Jokowi gave two speeches at the G20, one lasted five minutes and the other three minutes.", "lang": "en"}
