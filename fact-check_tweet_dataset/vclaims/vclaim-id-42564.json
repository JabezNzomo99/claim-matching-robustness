The image shows that there will be a \u2018Lockdown\u2019 phase from 20 March to 12 April, wherein \u2018Section 144\u2019 will be in place across all the affected areas. Then, there will be a \u2018Precautionary\u2019 phase with social distancing from 13 April to 17 May. Again, there will be another \u2018Lockdown\u2019 phase with \u2018Section 144\u2019 in place from 18 May to 31 May. Lastly, there will be an \u2018Open up\u2019 phase with all the restrictions lifted off from June. Let\u2019s check the authenticity of the message.\n\n\n\nClaim: Government of India has announced a \u2018National Lockdown\u2019 in the country from 20 March 2020. Fact: No, the Government of India hasn\u2019t announced a \u2018National Lockdown\u2019 in the country from 20 March. PM Modi, in his recent address to the nation about the Coronavirus outbreak, has asked people to practice \u2018social distancing\u2019 and to stay home as much as possible for the coming few weeks to combat COVID-19. Also, the Press Information Bureau (PIB) has clarified that the message is \u2018fake\u2019. So, the claim isFALSE.\n\nWhen searched on Google if the Government of India has announced a \u2018National Lockdown\u2019 in the country from 20 March, no information corroborating the same was found. On 19 March, PM Narendra Modi, in his address to the nation about Coronavirus outbreak, has asked people to practice \u2018social distancing\u2019 and to stay home as much as possible for the coming few weeks to combat COVID-19. Also, he assured that there is no shortage of essential goods and asked people to avoid panic buying. In his speech, Modi also asked the people of India to observe \u2018Janata Curfew\u2019 on 22 March by staying in their houses from 7 am to 9 pm. In his speech, PM Modi hasn\u2019t spoken anything about the \u2018National lockdown\u2019.\n\n\n\nWhen the same message went viral on 19 March saying that the things in it would feature in PM Modi\u2019s address to the nation about Coronavirus, the Press Information Bureau (PIB) has debunked it and clarified that the messages of \u2018National Lockdown\u2019 are baseless.\n\nWhen researched further, it is found that the image shared in the post is part of a presentation submitted to the government by entrepreneurs across India.\n\nTo sum it up, the Government of India hasn\u2019t announced a \u2018National Lockdown\u2019 in the country from 20 March. The message is a \u2018fake\u2019 one. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
