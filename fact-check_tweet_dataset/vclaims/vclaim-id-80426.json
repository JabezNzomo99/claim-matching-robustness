A source within the RBI confirmed to BOOM that the message was fake.\n\nThe spurious message also claims cash withdrawals of only Rs. 3000 will be permitted and urges people to reject any cheques of the bank. But the message does not explain how any withdrawal of cash is possible if the account is frozen.
