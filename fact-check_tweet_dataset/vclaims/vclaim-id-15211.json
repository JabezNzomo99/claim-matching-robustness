Instead, for each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the Special Counsel views as \u2018difficult issues\u2019 of law and fact concerning whether the President\u2019s actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction. The Special Counsel states that \u2018while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\u2019\u201d Barr during the Thursday news conference: \u201cAfter finding no underlying collusion with Russia, the Special Counsel\u2019s report goes on to consider whether certain actions of the President could amount to obstruction of the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation. As I addressed in my March 24th letter, the Special Counsel did not make a traditional prosecutorial judgment regarding this allegation. Instead, the report recounts 10 episodes involving the President and discusses potential legal theories for connecting these actions to elements of an obstruction offense.\u201d\n\nOn the report\u2019s early release to the White House\n\nOn whether the White House \u2018fully cooperated\u2019 with Mueller", "lang": "en"}
