The Trust says that the average person using a food bank will do so twice in a year, so it estimates that around 590,000 different people used its services in 2016/17.\n\nA 2014 estimate suggested that the Trussell Trust\u2019s food banks account for around half (420) of the food banks in the UK. That suggests the actual number of food parcels handed out across the UK, and the number of users of food banks, will be higher.\n\nThe number of food banks has also increased since 2010 so more people have access to a food bank now. That means we can\u2019t be sure that the increasing use of food banks is due to increasing demand. It may be that demand has stayed the same but there are now more services available for people to use. We\u2019re looking into the research that\u2019s been done on this.", "lang": "en"}
