It goes on to say that she has been unofficially diagnosed by Dr. Lauren A. Wright, a public affairs professor at Princeton University and a board member of the White House Transition Project.\n\nThe \"diagnosis\" referred to is the analysis of first ladies Wright gives in her book, On Behalf of the President. In the book, Wright describes the ways in which Obama helped shape her husband\u2019s legacy from a personal place as a mother and wife, focusing on her use of social media.\n\nWhile Wright notes that Obama has made more speeches and major public appearances in her first six years in office than any first lady in recent history, she writes that they were in support of her husband\u2019s policy agenda, not slams toward Trump and America.\n\nThe NY FOX News post contradicts itself by claiming that Obama has remained out of the public eye yet tries to remain \"the center of everyone\u2019s attention\" by making public remarks against America.\n\nThe article notes that one of the biggest claims made by Obama was that America was a racist nation that needed her husband in office. Obama has spoken out about racially motivated remarks that were made against her appearance while she was in office, but she has never claimed that America is \"a racist nation.\"\n\nThe other claim made is how Obama was never proud of America until her husband had been elected to the White House, a statement made in 2008 that was taken out of context and was debunked as False by PolitiFact in 2017.\n\nThe motivations of NY FOX News are unclear. The website appears to have started publishing stories on Feb. 28, 2018, most of which appear to be false. The website includes no contact information, has no \"About us\" page that we could find, and does list any authors. It does not appear to display advertising. The website is registered in Panama.\n\nThis claim about Michelle Obama\u2019s diagnosis is a hoax.\n\nWe rate it Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
