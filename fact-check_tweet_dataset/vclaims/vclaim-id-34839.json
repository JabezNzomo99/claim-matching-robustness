Ted Cruz said border communities in his home state of Texas are overwhelmed by the volume of people attempting to enter the country illegally.\n\nIn making his point, Cruz offered statistics about recent apprehensions and projections for the coming year.\n\nHere are his comments in full, according to a press release issued by his office:\n\n\"The Texas border is a wonderful place. Unfortunately right now, the border is a flashpoint for enormous political disagreement. On border security, what we are seeing is a crisis. As you know, we apprehended over 144,000 people in a single month. That is a pace, which if it continues for 12 months, would put us on a pace for nearly 2 million apprehensions on the border. That exceeds what we can handle. And I\u2019ve heard from a number of you in this room about how the volume of illegal crossings is now overwhelming infrastructure, overwhelming the ability of the communities to absorb that much population coming in.\"\n\nCruz repeated his claim about apprehension figures in a statement later that same day, after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced that he would deploy 1,000 Texas National Guard troops to the border.\n\n\"In May, the Border Patrol apprehended over 144,000 individuals \u2013 and if that pace continues, we\u2019re looking at nearly 2 million apprehensions in a single year,\" Cruz said in the statement.\n\nWe decided to fact-check these figures. Let\u2019s dive in.\n\nFirst, we\u2019ll look at Cruz\u2019s claim that federal agents have \"apprehended over 144,000 people in a single month.\"\n\nMaria Jeffrey, a spokeswoman for Cruz, directed us to an article from U.S. News and World Report titled, \"Arrests at Southern Border Jumped to 144,000 in May.\"\n\nShe also shared a link to data from Customs and Border Patrol with migration statistics from the southern border.\n\nA chart accompanying the data shows that in May, there were 144,278 people apprehended or deemed inadmissible at the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 the highest monthly total this fiscal year, the timeframe CBP uses to analyze apprehension data.\n\nThe problem here is that this figure includes both apprehensions and \u2018inadmissibles,\u2019 people who attempt to enter the country legally at ports of entry but were unable to enter.\n\nThis could include people \"presenting themselves to seek humanitarian protection,\" people who were seeking lawful admission but didn\u2019t meet the requirements, and people who ultimately withdrew their application for admission and returned to their countries of origin.\n\nThese individuals are not taken into custody at the border, but instead are turned away \u2014 the U.S. News and World Report story is wrong to count them in the same category as apprehensions.\n\nIn May, 11,391 people attempted to enter the country through ports of entry and were deemed inadmissible. This included 6,799 single adults, 4,124 family units, 386 unaccompanied children and 72 accompanied minors.\n\nThe actual number of apprehensions at the southern border in May was 132,887, which included 84,542 family units, 36,838 single adults and 11,507 unaccompanied children.\n\nThe second part of Cruz\u2019s statement looks at projected apprehensions. He said if apprehensions continue at the volume they did in May for the next 12 months, it would \"put us on a pace for nearly 2 million apprehensions on the border.\"\n\nIf we look at the 144,000 figure offered by Cruz and multiply it by 12, it would translate to more than 1.7 million apprehensions over the next year. Jeffrey confirmed that this is how Cruz calculated his estimate.\n\n\"And yes, 144,000 x 12 is 1,728,000 \u2013 so nearly 2 million,\" she wrote in an email.\n\nWhile Cruz\u2019s math is right, experts said that this is not an accurate way to estimate apprehensions.\n\n\"People who know the border well are aware that apprehensions typically follow seasonal patterns, so taking what in most years is the highest month of the year for apprehensions and multiplying by 12 will get you a rate well in excess of yearly totals,\" said Michelle Mittelstadt, spokeswoman for the Migration Policy Institute, in an email.\n\nData shows that June apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border have been lower than those in May during every fiscal year since 2000 \u2014 with the exception of 2017.\n\nBut relying on seasonal patterns could still give an inaccurate estimate of future apprehensions, due to the changing demographics of migrants.\n\nJeffrey Passel, senior demographer for the Pew Research Center, said the current influx of migrants is largely from Central America and includes significant numbers of families and children \"who are turning themselves in to the Border Patrol with the intention of claiming asylum.\"\n\nHistoric migration patterns at the southern border were driven by a different population group.\n\n\"For most of the (data on seasonal migration patterns), well over 95% of the apprehensions were Mexicans (mostly men), people coming to work in agriculture or other seasonal work,\" Passel said. \"Thus, models built on the historical apprehensions probably are not applicable to the current situation.\"\n\nBut Cruz\u2019s methodology for estimating future apprehensions isn\u2019t better.\n\nMittelstadt said Cruz could come up with a more accurate estimate if he used existing data to estimate future flows, instead of relying on figures from one month. This would account for monthly fluctuations and include data from both low and high months.\n\n\"We\u2019d be reluctant to undertake any such exercise, though, without noting how dynamic conditions are at the border right now,\" she said, pointing to changing policies at the border and the deployment of Mexican troops to the country\u2019s northern border.\n\nSince the start of the fiscal year (October), federal agents have made 593,507 apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border. More than 65% were people in a family unit or unaccompanied children.\n\nLooking at the calendar year, there have been 439,895 apprehensions at the southern border, with more than 67% being people in a family unit or unaccompanied children.\n\nN\u00e9stor Rodr\u00edguez, a sociology professor at the University of Texas at Austin who studies migration, also said in an email that the best way to estimate future apprehensions takes a variety of factors into account, including seasonal fluctuations and \"variables such as conditions of unemployment and crime levels in home countries and local settings.\"\n\nCruz said, \"As you know, we apprehended over 144,000 people in a single month. That is a pace, which if it continues for 12 months, would put us on a pace for nearly 2 million apprehensions on the border.\"\n\nCruz\u2019s assessment of the number of apprehensions includes figures for people who presented themselves to federal officials at ports of entry who were then \"deemed inadmissible.\" These individuals are turned back and are typically not taken into custody.\n\nThe second part of his statement offered an estimate for future apprehensions based on those figures. Changing demographics at the border make it tricky to estimate future flows, but experts agreed that Cruz\u2019s estimate (144,000 x 12) is far from accurate, since it doesn\u2019t take any other variables into account.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE \u2013 The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.", "lang": "en"}
