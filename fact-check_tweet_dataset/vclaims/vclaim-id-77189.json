Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as \"not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts - and fact-checking - in politics, journalism, and everyday life.\"\n\nEditor's note: Sunday, April 2, is International Fact-checking Day. To mark the day, PolitiFact will conduct a \"fact-check-a-thon\" on fake news. Here, our editor Angie Drobnic Holan explains the need for an International Fact-checking Day and how you can stand up for facts.\n\nIn the posts we examined, the same false details emerged about the U.S. Secret Service arresting Pelosi, a Democrat from San Francisco, because she was \"wanted for questioning in a possible coup attempt against the president.\"\n\nNo credible media sources repeated the story. Also, the fact-checking website Snopes.com, called it out as \"False\" on March 11, 2017.\n\nAs is the case with several other claims checked before by PolitiFact, this fake news claim originally came from a website called TheLastLineOfDefense.org.\n\nAs noted by Snopes.com, the claim then spread to other \"unreliable sites.\"\n\nTheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn\u2019t identify the Pelosi story as fake, but its About Us page notes that \"all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.\"\n\nThe site has not responded to PolitiFact.\n\nRather than being behind bars, Pelosi has remained active in Washington D.C. and in her district in recent weeks.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what she\u2019s been up to:\n\n-- Pelosi spoke at a press conference on March 13, 2017 in Washington D.C. in response to the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s report on the GOP health care proposal\n\n-- Pelosi participated in a press conference on March 24, 2017 in Washington D.C. reacting to the GOP\u2019s failed bid to repeal Obamacare\n\n-- Pelosi attended a town hall meeting with constituents in San Francisco on March 25, 2017\n\n-- Pelosi called for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-California, to recuse himself from the panel\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election\n\nIn the end, the claim that Pelosi was \"just taken from her office in handcuffs\" is \"total baloney,\" to use a phrase from TheLastLineOfDefense.org.\n\nWe rate it Pants on Fire.\n\nPANTS ON FIRE \u2013 The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
