This child has now been born in Israel\u2026may Allah protect us all. May Allah shower good fortune. Amen.\u201d\n\nThe aforestated message has gone viral on Facebook along with a video which shows an infant with only one eye. The video is 52 seconds long and is of disconcerting nature. Viewer discretion is advised.\n\nThe above post is of the page AIMIM India, a fan page of the Hyderabad-based political party.

Several individual users have posted this video on their Facebook timelines with identical text.\n\nThe video depicts a condition called cyclopia, which is a rare birth defect. It is a type of holoprosencephaly, a disorder in which the forebrain fails to separate completely into two distinct cerebral hemispheres (left and right). According to Healthline, cyclopia is a rare occurrence (1 in 100,000 newborns) and is also found in animals such as dogs, sheep, goats, etc.\n\nBabies born with this defect barely survive for a few hours. A common symptom of cyclopia \u201cis a single eye or a partially divided eye\u201d. The term \u2018cyclopia\u2019 derives from \u2018Cyclops\u2018, a Greek mythical one-eyed giant.\n\nAlt News reverse-searched one of the keyframes of the viral video, and found a that it has been floating on the internet at least since July 2013.\n\nThis video is of a baby born with a rare birth defect called \u2018cyclopia\u2019 and has nothing to do with \u2018Antichrist\u2019 or \u2018Dajjal\u2019.", "lang": "en"}
