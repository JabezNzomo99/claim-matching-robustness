Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media website\u2019s efforts to cut down on fake news.\n\nThe post says U.S. Sen. Hal Lindsay, D-N.J., owned a Wyoming ranch that was just raided by the agency, which seized \"more than 400 marijuana plants, 2 greenhouses full of opium-producing poppies and a small lab that was pumping out massive amounts of refined, finished product.\" The story said Lindsay was released on $10 million bail and faced more than 70 years in prison just for the opium.\n\nExcept Lindsay isn\u2019t in any trouble, because he doesn\u2019t exist. New Jersey\u2019s two senators are Democrats Cory Booker and Bob Menendez.\n\nThere also was no bust, because the story was made up and posted on June 10 at TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a site run by Christopher Blair, a fake news operator whom we have profiled in the past.\n\nTheLastLineOfDefense.org runs fake news stories written by Blair in an attempt to fool conservative readers. These stories often are posted on other websites without attribution or indication they are fake.\n\nThe site\u2019s disclaimer said that it \"is a satirical publication that may sometimes appear to be telling the truth. We assure you that\u2019s not the case. We present fiction as fact and our sources don\u2019t actually exist.\"\n\nThe story about the drug bust continued on Blair\u2019s website, with the fictional Lindsay agreeing in a followup story also posted on June 10 to flip on his business partner, Lester Malroney. The saga telegraphed it\u2019s contrived premise, calling Malroney \"an obviously fictitious name\" and suddenly referred to Lindsay as a senator from Wyoming, not just having a ranch in Wyoming (the state\u2019s senators are actually Republicans Mike Enzi and John Barrasso).\n\nThe fictitious saga led to the pretend senator's death and more, including implicating Chelsea Clinton and tying the DEA raid to a previous fake yarn about the Clinton Foundation smuggling contraband and refugees.\n\nWe attempted to reach NewsFeedHunter.com through their website contact form to ask if they knew the story was fake, but didn\u2019t receive a reply. The site\u2019s registration information is private.\n\nBut we know the story is contrived, because all the articles at TheLastLineOfDefense.org are made up.\n\nWe rate this statement Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
