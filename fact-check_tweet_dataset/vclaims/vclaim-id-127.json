But international news not showing this\u201d.\n\nThis video has been taken out of context. The footage, originally distributed by local news outlet The Stand News, actually shows protesters tearing down 'smart' lampposts in Hong Kong in August 2019 because of fears they could be used to collect people\u2019s personal data. The original video can be seen here .\n\nAccording to the South China Morning Post, Hong Kong protesters were concerned the \u2018smart\u2019 lampposts, intended for traffic and weather data collection, among other things, could be used for surveillance and monitoring the population ( here ).\n\nIn an article mentioning this incident, the Financial Times reported: \u201cThe suspicions around facial recognition in Hong Kong provide a warning of what can happen when a government\u2019s lack of transparency in its use of surveillance tech collides with widespread anger over governance. In the absence of trust, citizens are turning to their own theories of what technology the government is using against them.\u201d ( here ).\n\nThe allegation that it is 5G that is making people sick and not COVID-19 has been previously debunked by the Reuters Fact Check team here .\n\nFalse: This is a video showing Hong Kong protesters tearing down \u2018smart\u2019 lampposts in 2019, not people tearing down 5G poles in China\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
