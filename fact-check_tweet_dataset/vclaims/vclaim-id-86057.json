She is a mental-health therapist, and in 2012, she said in an interview, she acquired some hens as therapy animals for children. She says she had no idea that the Braleys were upset about the hens wandering onto their property until earlier this year. She offered some eggs to Braley\u2019s wife, Carolyn, and she refused to take them. \u201cWe\u2019ve filed a formal complaint against you,\u201d Carolyn Braley told Hampton.\n\nIt turns out that other neighbors also were not happy with the hens, and on May 8 the Holiday Lake Board of Directors told Hampton to fence in the chickens, according to the board\u2019s minutes. But that solution apparently was not acceptable to Braley, who a week or so later called Thomas Lacina, the outside lawyer for the board.\n\nAccording to Lacina\u2019s account, delivered by e-mail to the board on May 29, Braley \u201cwas complaining about the lack of action by the Holiday Lake Board as to the chickens at Holiday Lake. The implication from Mr. Braley was that he wants to \u2018avoid a litigious situation\u2019 and believes strongly that chickens are not pets and should not be permitted at Holiday Lake.\u201d\n\nLacina also included a six-page legal memo in which he had carefully researched the Lake Association\u2019s covenant, relevant laws in Iowa and also legal cases concerning \u201cpets\u201d in other states. \u201cIn conclusion, I think the position reached by the board is supportable under the specific facts,\u201d he said. The board instructed him to write Braley, and on June 3, Lacina wrote a letter saying the board\u2019s decision to allow Hampton to keep her chickens was reasonable. \u201cIndeed, the opposite decision might be highly contestable in court,\u201d he added.\n\nWe sent e-mails and left messages for Lacina, asking whether this was indeed a direct quote from Braley. But Lacina won\u2019t elaborate on his letter because he would be violating client confidentiality, Jenson said. The Braley campaign did not respond to a request to confirm whether he had actually used the phrase \u201clitigious situation.\u201d\n\nThe Fact Checker contacted all of the board members who received Lacina\u2019s e-mail, but only two would speak for the record. William F. Nagel said that \u201cwe were led to believe\u201d that Braley had threatened a lawsuit, based on \u201cthe response we got from our lawyer.\u201d He said he was still mystified by Braley\u2019s failure to simply discuss the situation face-to-face with Hampton.\n\nJenson, the board vice president, said: \u201cWhen I read the letter, it meant that Mr. Braley said it could mean a litigious situation. But I never seriously considered that it could come to that.\u201d Jensen did not believe Braley was threatening the board, but that he was considering suing Hampton. \u201cIt would have been a civil matter between two neighbors,\u201d he said. \u201cMy advice to Bruce would have been: get a dog.\u201d\n\nSo, clearly at least some members of the board believed Braley was at least hinting at taking some sort of legal action. Lacina, the lawyer, also treated the call with great seriousness. After all, Braley is not only a member of Congress but a former president of the Iowa Trial Lawyers Association. One can easily view Lacina\u2019s memo as the work product of an attorney who was preparing for the threat of litigation.\n\nShe also didn\u2019t understand why Braley or his wife did not speak to her first, given that they have been neighbors for 15 years. She said that when she filed a complaint with the board against a neighbor for burning tires in a wood burner, she took that step only after \u201cmany conversations with him\u201d to explain that he was violating pollution regulations.\n\nThat\u2019s still not enough to fully validate her claim. We wavered between One and Two Pinocchios but ultimately settled on One. Braley clearly said something to Lacina that made the board concerned enough to validate the legal basis for their initial decision. Braley probably would have saved himself a lot of grief if he had first walked over to his neighbor\u2019s house to discuss his concerns about the chickens.", "lang": "en"}
