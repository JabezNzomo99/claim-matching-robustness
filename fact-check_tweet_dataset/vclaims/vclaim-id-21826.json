He also brought attention to President Barack Obama\u2019s deportation record.\n\n\"President Obama has moved millions of people out. Nobody knows about it. Nobody talks about it. But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country. They've been deported,\" Trump said.\n\nDeportations and what to do with millions of people in the country illegally are highly controversial topics. Trump himself has not stuck to one approach about it.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt many people have been deported under Obama\u2019s presidency --- but we were curious about Trump\u2019s claim of \"millions\" and on lack of information about it, \"nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security issues yearly statistics on enforcement actions. The latest available is for fiscal year 2014, which is Oct. 1, 2013, to Sept. 30, 2014.\n\nFrom fiscal years 2009 to 2014, there have been more than 2.4 million removals, according to DHS data. Fiscal year 2009 includes data for a few months in which Obama was not in office.\n\nStill, if we add just the full fiscal years in which he has been office, and for which data is available (2010-2014), there have been over 2 million removals. That corroborates Trump\u2019s claim that \"under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country.\"\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement also issues removal data. But its removal totals equals the sum of two actions: \"removals\" and \"returns.\"\n\nRemovals account for people moved out of the country based on a formal order from a judge. Returns track people who were encountered by ICE, but who chose to depart the United States prior to a resolution of their immigration case.\n\nEven then, ICE data shows that more than 2 million people have been moved out of the country while Obama has been in office, supporting part of Trump\u2019s claim.\n\n\u2018Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it\u2019\n\nIn the debate, however, Trump also claimed these millions of deportations have not been spoken about.\n\n\"Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it,\" Trump said.\n\nBut there is extensive reporting that shows otherwise. For years, news outlets have reported on Obama\u2019s deportation numbers.\n\n2010: The Washington Post reported that \"the Obama administration is deporting record numbers of illegal immigrants.\"\n\n2012: NPR reported that the Obama administration \"deported a record 1.5 million\" in his first term.\n\n2014: An analysis by The New York Times found that since Obama became president, \"two-thirds of the nearly two million deportation cases involve people who had committed minor infractions, including traffic violations, or had no criminal record at all.\"\n\n2016: The New York Times reported in June that Obama \"has carried out many more deportations than previous presidents, setting a record of more than 2.4 million formal removals.\"\n\nEven immigration advocates have called out Obama for his deportation record, challenging his campaign promise to provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\n\nObama was dubbed the \"Deporter-in-Chief\" in 2014 by Janet Murgu\u00eda, president of the National Council of La Raza, an immigrant advocacy group.\n\n\"For the president, I think his legacy is at stake here,\" Murgu\u00eda told Politico in March 2014. \"We consider him the deportation president, or the deporter-in-chief.\"\n\nWe pointed out the Politico article to Trump\u2019s campaign and a spokesperson said, \"That was published over two years ago.\" But Trump\u2019s claim at the debate did not specify that deportations under Obama are not currently being talked about -- which would still be an inaccurate statement.\n\nObama addressed the \"Deporter-In-Chief\" moniker in a 2014 interview with Jorge Ramos, a Fusion and Univision anchor. Ramos told him 2 million deportations under his presidency had destroyed families and that he was called \"Deporter-in-Chief.\" Obama said it was \"not true\" when Ramos said he could\u2019ve stopped deportations.\n\n\"There certainly has been a lot of folks who have focused on Obama\u2019s deportation record,\" said William Stock, an immigration lawyer and president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \"No one can argue that not only have there been hundreds of thousands of removals each year, but there have also been a lot of people talking about those removals.\"\n\nThe number of deportations under Obama have been raised by the press, advocacy groups and even at congressional hearings with Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., a Trump adviser, Stock said.\n\nTrump said \"Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it, but under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country, they've been deported.\"\n\nMore than 2.4 million people have been deported under Obama\u2019s presidency. But Trump\u2019s claim that \"nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it,\" is completely wrong. Not only is federal data issued about it on a yearly basis, there has also been extensive media coverage about it. Immigration advocates have called out the president for it and congressional hearings on deportations have also taken place.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim is partly right.
