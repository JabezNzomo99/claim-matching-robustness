This claim is false.\n\nExamples of this claim can be seen here and here .\n\nThe image appears to be a scanned copy of a crumpled document containing \u201capproved practices\u201d for protesting, instructions around whether to escalate the conflict, guidelines for the use of props, and other directions for \u201cgeneral behavior\u201d. At the bottom of the page, the document is marked \u201cconfidential\u201d, and \u201cLevel 7\u201d, implying the involvement of government entities. The scanned document also contains what appears to be the signature of \u201cSoros\u201d.\n\nThis \u201cleaked\u201d document, however, is not recent, nor is its appearance online related to the protests across the U.S. following the death of George Floyd. A quick search online shows that this scanned page is part of a larger instruction manual posted online at least as far back as 2018 by outlets like Infowars, in which it alleged a funding conspiracy related to protests after the death of Freddie Gray in April, 2015.\n\nOne version of the claim featuring a longer document can be seen in a Twitter post, here .\n\nThe longer document is entitled \u201cBWI0418\u201915\u201d, in reference to Baltimore \u2014the place of Gray\u2019s death and of the subsequent protests\u2014which began in mid-April 2015 (Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport is often referred to as BWI). Other hand-written notes on the document also reference April 2015. This longer document appeared to start circulating online around 2018.\n\nAt the top, the document prominently shows the logo for \u201cFriends of Democracy\u201d, a Super PAC (Political Action Committee) founded by Jonathan Soros, son of George Soros ( archive.vn/wvAl2 ). In past election cycles, the Friends of Democracy Super PAC had donated exclusively to Democratic politicians ( here ).\n\nIn 2014, the Huffington Post reported Friends of Democracy merged with the Public Campaign Action fund to create Every Voice, a non-profit organization focused on campaign finance reform ( here ). Friends of Democracy therefore merged into a different PAC a year prior to the protests in Baltimore following Freddie Gray\u2019s death in April 2015, and six years prior to the protests following George Floyd\u2019s death in May 2020.\n\nWhen the claims that Friends of Democracy were funding protesters after Gray\u2019s death circulated in 2018, the CEO of the organization, David Donnelly, issued a statement on Twitter confirming these flyers were fabricated: \u201c[\u2026] No, Friends of Democracy PAC was created in 2012 to help elect money-in-politics reform champions. Period. Any document that says FOD was involved in, or funded, or in any way encourage, the protests in Baltimore after Freddie Gray\u2019s death IS COMPLETELY FALSE AND FORGED.\u201d ( here )\n\nReuters recently debunked a claim related to fake flyers showing job listings to become \u201cprofessional anarchists\u201d and implicating George Soros here .\n\nFalse. George Floyd protesters were not issued these instructions.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
