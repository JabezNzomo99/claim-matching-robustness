BOOM had previously fact checked a set of three images of old women sharing space with Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Shashi Tharoor, and BJP leader K Surendran. We found that they had distinctly different facial features. The photo of an old woman with Kamalnath, however, was earlier viral with a different claim and is a recent addition to the misinformation.", "lang": "en"}
