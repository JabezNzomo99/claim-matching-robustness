The photo does not show Harris\u2019s parents, but rather two supporters she posed with at a charity gala in 2016.\n\nExamples of these posts can be found here and here . Text on the posts asks: \u201cWhy does she keep referring to herself as an African American?\u201d\n\nThe photo ( here ) was taken on August 27, 2016 in Palo Alto, California, at an event hosted by the Indian-American charity group Pratham in support of children\u2019s education in India. It shows then California Attorney General Harris standing between supporters Suneil and Rohini Parulekar, both identified on Pratham\u2019s website as executive board members ( here ).\n\nThe posts on social deny that Harris has African ancestry, attempting to discredit the senator and former presidential candidate\u2019s Black identity. In a 2019 interview with DJ Envy and Charlamagne Tha God on their radio show \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d ( here ), Harris answered questions on the \u201clegitimacy\u201d of her Black identity by saying the following: \u201cI am Black and I am proud of it\u2026 I was born black and I\u2019ll die black and I am proud of it. And I am not going to make any excuses for it, for anybody, because they don't understand.\u201d ( here )\n\nPublished by San Francisco Bay Area newspaper The Mercury News, an image of Harris\u2019s parents together can be found here . Harris\u2019s father, Donald Harris, immigrated to the U.S. from Jamaica in 1964 to pursue a doctorate degree in economics at the University of California, Berkeley; her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, had come from India for doctoral work in endocrinology ( here ).\n\nDonald Harris is a former economics professor at Stanford University ( here ).\n\nJamaica\u2019s population largely consists of those descended from enslaved Africans brought by the English to work the island\u2019s sugar estates ( here ). As of 2012, 90% of Jamaicans were of African origin ( here ).\n\nThe senator\u2019s late mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was Tamil Indian-American. Gopalan graduated from the University of Delhi and then received a PhD in nutrition and endocrinology from UC Berkeley ( here ). She became a cancer researcher at Berkeley, and then at the University of Illinois and the University of Wisconsin. Gopalan died of colon cancer in 2009 ( here ), seven years before the photo of her daughter with Suneil and Rohini Parulekar was taken.\n\nFalse. This photo does not show the parents of Kamala Harris, but two supporters at a 2016 charity event.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
