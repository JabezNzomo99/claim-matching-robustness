They said they did so to prove that the city\u2019s mosques and shrines, which draw millions of Muslim pilgrims a year, are immune to coronavirus. The videos have instantly gone viral.\n\nIn one of the videos, an unidentified Iranian man films himself walking inside the shrine. \u201cIn sacred places like this, there is no room for viruses, germs or diseases,\u201d he says looking into the camera.\n\nMasih Alinejad, a prominent Iranian journalist who tweeted the video, told Polygraph.info it was filmed in the Fatima Masumeh shrine in the city of Qom. The video is authentic she said. VOA Persian's Farhad Poulad viewed the video and agreed.\n\nQom is some 80 miles south of Iran\u2019s capital Tehran. The coronavirus outbreak has significantly reduced tourism in Iran, hitting Qom hard.\n\nIran announced the country\u2019s first COVID-19 deaths on Feb. 19. As of March 9, Iran\u2019s official COVID-19 death toll had reached 237, and the number of people infected is nearing 8,000.\n\nMedical experts and government critics in Iran say these estimates are intentionally low and that the real figure is likely 10 times higher.\n\nAlinejad tweeted several of the videos from Qom on March 3, describing the men shown in them as \u201cpro-regime people.\u201d By refusing the quarantine places like Qom, she wrote, the Iranian government is endangering people both inside and outside Iran.\n\nAbdul Karim Hosseinzadeh, a member of the Iranian parliament, supported Alinejad\u2019s call for an immediate quarantine, saying that \u201ccorpses are piling up\u201d on the streets of Qom.\n\n\"Authorities in Iran said they arrested a man for posting a video online of bodies wrapped in white shrouds and zipped into black body bags at a cemetery in Qom on Monday,\u201d Time magazine reported.\n\n\"The video purports to show over 30 corpses waiting to be washed per Islamic tradition, with a man\u2019s voice alleging all were \u201ccorona-infected.\u201d\n\nThe videos emerged after Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called COVID-19 a \u201cso-called virus\u201d that was a scare tactic used by Iran\u2019s enemies to prevent people from voting in Iran\u2019s Feb. 21 parliamentary elections.\n\nTwo weeks later, Khamenei\u2019s message changed. \u201cDon\u2019t violate the recommendations and instructions of the responsible authorities in terms of prevention, in terms of keeping hands, face and living environment clean and not infecting these and preventing the infection of these,\u201d he said on March 3, appearing in a video showing him planting trees in a garden.\n\nIran\u2019s deputy health minister, Iraj Harirchi, said on Feb. 28 that quarantines belonged to the WWI era of \u201cplague, cholera and stuff like that.\u201d He said accusations that Iran was hiding the true COVID-19 statistics were baseless and that the government had \u201calmost stabilized\u201d the situation.\n\nHarirchi confirmed a day later that he had been quarantined after testing positive for coronavirus.\n\nOn March 3, Iranian authorities said two men shown in videos licking shrines in Qom had ignored government recommendations and could be jailed and flogged.\n\nIran\u2019s government also banned prayers on Friday, the one day of the week that Muslims are obliged to pray in a mosque.\n\nCOVID-19\u2019s march through Iran has been accompanied by numerous claims of false cures and a government-backed disinformation campaign labeling the virus as part of a U.S. \"psychological warfare operation\" against China and Iran.", "lang": "en"}
