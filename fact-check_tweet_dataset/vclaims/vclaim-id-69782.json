Clips of the 2008 footage were posted on several blogs at the time, verifying the segment\u2019s age.\n\nAt the time, Ike had been downgraded to a tropical storm, but there was still significant flooding in the area where Cooper was reporting. Cooper notes several times that the water is receding. At one point, he has his cameraman film a wooden pole that is still wet from when water levels were about a foot-and-a-half higher.\n\n\"You can see the water is definitely going down,\" he said in the 2008 liveshot.\n\nCooper also said in the original liveshot that he\u2019s standing next to a road that is on higher ground than most of the area and is being used for evacuations. He points out that there is a drop-off from the road to the surrounding area.\n\nIn his fact-checking segment, Cooper said his camera crew was standing near the road to keep the camera equipment dry. He also said he was not standing on the road because he did not want to hinder the evacuation efforts.\n\nDoug Thomas, a long-time CNN audio technician, was the cameraman seen in the viral photo. He died in September 2017.\n\nThis photo comes from 2008 coverage of Hurricane Ike. Cooper repeatedly shows the range of water depth in the liveshot and is not on his knees or in a ditch. Because the photo is from 2008, the liveshot was not taken to \"make @realDonaldTrump look bad.\"\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
