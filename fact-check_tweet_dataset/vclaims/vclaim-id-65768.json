Also, evidence showed that in many cases \"suspicious\" bricks depicted on social media were on streets for ongoing construction projects, not \"planted\" for protesters.\n\nProtesters in many major U.S. cities used bricks to cause destruction \u2014 or, in some cases, to injure police \u2014 while walking on streets during the 2020 demonstrations.\n\nAs American cities erupted in protests against racism and police brutality following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020, social media users began spreading posts alleging that some group \u2014 or person \u2014 with nefarious intentions had coordinated a scheme to incite and abet violence during the demonstrations by pre-placing piles of bricks along protest routes.\n\nThe claim could be summarized like this: Government officials, law enforcement, billionaires, or protesters themselves had strategically placed caches of cinder blocks in cities nationwide \u2014 including Boston, Dallas, Kansas City, and New York City \u2014 so protesters could quickly grab the bricks and break windows or cause other property damage. Among the most popular posts was a video of someone who recorded a pile of bricks purportedly near a Dallas courthouse and called the pallets a \u201csetup\u201d while another person claimed, \u201cthey put them there on purpose, bro.'\u201d\n\nIt is unequivocally true that protesters in many major U.S. cities used bricks to cause destruction (or, in some cases, to injure police) during the protests against police brutality following the death of George Floyd \u2014 a 46-year-old, unarmed black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.\n\nBut less is known about where, or from whom, the protesters got the bricks, and if the rumors on social media alleging a coordinated scheme on behalf of government, activists, or a powerful figure had any truth.\n\nWhat follows is a multi-prong examination into the claim. First, we describe the different groups behind the assertion, and then we investigate this specific theory: that the government, police, or another powerful entity formed a scheme to pre-place the bricks along protest routes so officers could retaliate against people who used them or to incite destruction. Lastly, we examine the possibility that the bricks were strategically placed on streets by protesters themselves.\n\nWho Is Making the Claim?\n\nAn array of people claimed pallets of bricks appeared in protest hot spots as some nefarious scheme, essentially forming three distinct groups that blamed different entities or people for the alleged conspiracy.\n\nFirst, some people said police officers or government authorities pre-placed the stacks of bricks to create what protesters called a \u201ctrap\u201d set up by officers to quickly catch anyone who used them and have a reason to use excessive force. Many believers of that theory used the hashtag #baitbricks on social media to spread awareness of the alleged government-run scheme and circulated the below-displayed poster as a safety message for protesters:\n\nOther people were less specific with where, or on whom, they were placing blame for the alleged conspiracy to undermine Americans during the protests, and the perpetrators\u2019 rationale.\n\nThey included followers of the QAnon movement and accounts that suggested without any proof that billionaire investor Warren Buffet, Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates, or financier George Soros owned the bricks and created a master plan to instigate violence. For instance, the Twitter account of an anti-vaccine advocate claimed in a June 2 video that went viral:\n\nWhile the videographer did accurately state that Berkshire Hathaway owns the brick manufacturer, that Gates stepped down from Hathaway\u2019s board in March 2020, and that Hathaway owns the industrial holding company Marmon Group in Chicago that Jay Pritzker and Robert Pritzker founded, no evidence suggests any truth behind the video\u2019s underlying claim: that Acme Brick Company, the nation\u2019s largest brick maker, was indeed coordinating brick drop-offs for protesters.\n\nThat brings us to our next point: Some accounts believed antifa (short for anti-fascist) activists \u2014 who include a variety of leftist groups that fight white supremacy and neo-Nazis \u2014 distributed the bricks on streets where they knew they would be protesting for easy access in the heat of the moment. Among that group of skeptics was a Twitter account with more than 145,000 followers to promote \u201cFelccas Talks\u201d \u2014 a pro-U.S. President Donald Trump media campaign \u2014 which tweeted the following, aiming to raise suspicion among his fans that bricks seemed too convenient for protesters to simply discover:\n\nBy June 1, the Daily Mail, FOXNews, and Breitbart had published stories on the phenomenon, articles that essentially recirculated the claims from social media users without attempting to examine from where the bricks originated.\n\nHad Pallets of Bricks Appeared at Protest Sites?\n\nConsidering the variety and amount of video and photographic evidence that shows bricks in areas where protesters were planning to gather, or already had, we can conclusively state: Yes, pallets of bricks were indeed along protest routes in multiple U.S. cities in late May and early June 2020.\n\nBut how they got there, in many cases, was less exciting than what conspiracists claimed. Per video footage, Google Maps, and other evidence, stockpiles of bricks in several cities with protests had been placed on streets long before the demonstrations following Floyd\u2019s death began, as part of a construction project in the area, or else the bricks had a destination that wasn\u2019t a protest site.\n\nIn regards to that latter point, a video that was viewed more than 3.2 million times in just days (even after the user who apparently captured the footage deleted it) showed police officers in Boston preparing bricks in the bed of a pickup to allegedly drop off at protest sites, according to claims online. One Instagram caption to the footage read:\n\nBut according to police authorities, viewers misinterpreted what police were doing with the bricks and where they were taking them.\n\nPer the Northeastern University Police Department (NUPD), which provides security and law enforcement for the Boston campus, the officers in the video are part of the campus force and were on a routine patrol on June 1 when they discovered a damaged brick sidewalk on a popular corridor. To prevent pedestrians from injuring themselves, the officers said they picked up the bricks, returned them to NUPD headquarters (shown in the video), and notified the city\u2019s police force about the sidewalk damage. The agency said on Twitter:\n\nAlong the same lines of what appeared to be viral misinterpretations, the below-displayed photos made the rounds on social media, apparently referencing locations in Dallas.\n\nBut by studying Google Map footage and other evidence related to the claim, a team of NBC journalists determined the photographs actually documented vehicles removing bricks \u2014 not leaving them on streets like the claim asserted \u2014 and the bricks had been in that location since February 2020, months before Floyd\u2019s death.\n\nA similar misunderstanding seemed to have transpired over a video titled \u201cLos Angeles Resident Finds Stash of Rocks by Bus Stop \u2026 Antifa Terrorism\u201d that shows crates of bricks along Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks, California, and includes audio of the videographer saying:\n\nHowever, a Jewish community center on the street, Chabad of Sherman Oaks, said that claim was false, and that the center was responsible for installing the crates months before the protests began as a security precaution to protect the building. A Facebook post by the synagogue said:\n\nSome Reports Appeared to Be Related to Construction, Not to the Demonstrations\n\nIn New York City, the claim surfaced via the below-displayed tweet, which includes a video that\u2019s been viewed more than 3.7 million times and depicts protesters in Manhattan removing barricades surrounding a stack of bricks and then taking from the stockpile. The video stops before viewers see what they do with the cinder blocks, but people can be heard celebrating them.\n\nBut according to our examination of the footage, construction scaffolding is nearby, suggesting that the bricks were part of an on-going construction project rather than some organized scheme. Also, a Google Map image from June 2019 confirms the presence of scaffolding and that the site is under construction.\n\nSimilarly, in Frisco, Texas, where tweets claimed multiple pallets of bricks had been \u201cplanted\u201d near where protests were scheduled, construction crews were seen covering the bricks with tarps as an effort to keep them to complete a purported highway project \u2014 not some strategic plan to instigate protesters.\n\nIn response to another report in that city, the Frisco Police Department said a pile was part of a housing construction project near protesters\u2019 scheduled route, and police removed those stacks from the area to avoid any temptation by protesters. Frisco police Sgt. Evan Mattei told The Associated Press:\n\n\u201cAt this point, our department has no intelligence to suggest that any bricks have been placed on this specific route in advance of this protest for violent purposes.\u201d\n\nOn that same point, the San Francisco Police Department said pallets of bricks that social media users believed to be \u201can attempt to escalate our protest\u201d were part of a construction project, and the department asked the contractor to remove them from the street.\n\nA similar story played out in Fort Myers, Florida, where city officials told the local NBC news station the bricks in question were part of a project to install optic fiber in the area. \u201cThe bricks have been here for a long time,\u201d said a resident, who works in the downtown area.\n\nMeanwhile, in Fayetteville, North Carolina, someone recorded a video in which viewers can see protesters and what the narrator called \u201csome random-ass bricks\u201d near them. But those stacks, too, had apparently been in the area before demonstrations began and were part of a project to improve the walkway for pedestrians.\n\nA video that was uploaded to YouTube on May 24 (the day before Floyd\u2019s death) about the city\u2019s reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic confirmed this theory (it shows the bricks), as well as a 2018 document called \u201cFayetteville comprehensive pedestrian plan\u201d that listed the site as one in need of crosswalk and signal improvements. Additionally, BBC misinformation specialists confirmed with the city of Fayetteville that construction crews had placed the bricks on the sidewalk recently for restoration work.\n\nMight Protesters Have Purposefully Placed Stockpiles of Bricks on Streets?\n\nThose misunderstandings aside, at least two government-run departments \u2014 the Kansas City Police and Houston Public Works \u2014 said they had received and investigated reports of \u201cbricks and rocks\u201d during the demonstrations.\n\nThe former agency \u2014 without providing photographic evidence or further details \u2014 suggested the \u201cstashes\u201d were purposefully placed \u201cto be used during a riot,\u201d essentially suggesting an effort by someone or a group to cause property destruction with the cinder blocks.\n\nFurthermore, in reference to the claims that protesters, perhaps those who consider themselves anti-fascists, had pre-placed the bricks, it is important to note that not all activists who resist fascism use weapons or cause property destruction during protests. However, some antifa members believe any violence that does occur during protests is a form of self-defense to combat extreme right-wing ideologies.\n\n\u201cAntifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,\u201d which historian Mark Bray published in 2017 and explores the movement since the 1920s, includes several instances during protests in which followers of the leftist ideas hurled bricks or had the cinder blocks thrown at them. One group in a newsletter described its activism strategy as:\n\nIn sum, since no evidence suggests there was a coordinated effort on behalf of government entities or billionaires to pre-place bricks on protest routes to incite violence during the 2020 demonstrations against police brutality, and considering the amount and variety of proof that showed many of the reports of suspicious bricks on social media were misunderstandings, we rate this claim \u201cMostly False\u201d \u2014 with the caveat that it is possible that antifa members or other protesters could have strategically placed bricks in easily accessible spots to facilitate causing property damage.", "lang": "en"}
