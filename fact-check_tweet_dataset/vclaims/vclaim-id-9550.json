It clearly indicates that Comey had long contemplated making a public statement about the conclusion of the investigation. Whether it also shows that he had decided on the outcome before Clinton was interviewed is unclear. The various drafts of his statement have not been released.\n\nThen-FBI Director Comey tells reporters that he would make sure politics does not infect the investigation. \u201cI am following this very closely, and I get briefed on it regularly,\u201d he said. \u201cI am confident we have the resources and the personnel assigned to the matter, as we do all our work, so that we are able to do it in a professional, prompt and independent way.\u201d\n\nFBI receives Russian intelligence document claiming a tacit understanding between the Clinton campaign and the Justice Department, citing an email in which then-Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch had privately assured someone in the Clinton campaign that the probe would not delve deeply. FBI later concluded the document was likely a fake, but current and former officials told The Washington Post that Comey relied on the document in making his July decision to announce on his own, without Justice Department involvement, that the investigation was over.\n\nComey sends an email to Andrew McCabe, his deputy, James A. Baker, the FBI general counsel, and James Rybicki, his chief of staff, with a subject heading of \u201cMidyear Exam.\u201d This was internal FBI code for the Clinton investigation. The body of the email was redacted by the FBI, but it appears to have contained a draft of his statement on the conclusion of the Clinton case.\n\nPaul Combetta, a computer specialist who worked for a company that hosted Clinton\u2019s private email system, admits in his interview that he had misled the FBI in an earlier interview about whether he was aware of a congressional request to preserve emails. Instead, he admitted he was aware of the order and yet he used a program called BleachBit to delete email messages. The FBI grants him immunity in exchange for his testimony.\n\nFormer president Bill Clinton meets for 30 minutes with Lynch as her plane is parked at Phoenix airport. Both later insist it was only a social call, related to grandchildren and travel. \u201cThere was no discussion of any matter pending for the department or any matter pending for any other body,\u201d Lynch told reporters on June 29. \u201cThere was no discussion of Benghazi, no discussion of the State Department emails.\u201d\n\nLynch refused calls to recuse herself but said she would accept whatever career prosecutors and the FBI recommended. The incident reinforced Comey\u2019s desire to make his own statement on the case. \u201cHer meeting with President Clinton on that airplane was the capper for me,\u201d he later told Congress. \u201cAnd I then said, you know what, the Department cannot by itself credibly end this.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt one point the attorney general had directed me not to call it an investigation, but instead to call it a matter, which confused me and concerned me, but that was one of the bricks in the load that led me to conclude I have to step away from the Department if we\u2019re to close this case credibly,\u201d Comey testified.\n\nJust days later, in an unusual step, Comey announces that Clinton would not be charged with any criminal wrongdoing. But in what he later said was an effort to be transparent, he provides details about what the probe uncovered and blasts Clinton\u2019s reliance on a private email system for government communications.\n\n\u201cAlthough we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,\u201d Comey said. He added that \u201cthere is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know in our political lives sometimes people casually accuse each other of being dishonest, but if colleagues of ours believe I am lying about when I made this decision, please urge them to contact me privately so we can have a conversation about this,\u201d Comey said. \u201cAll I can do is to tell you again, the decision was made after that, because I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen in that interview. She maybe lied in the interview in a way we could prove.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
