Antifa has been bussed in and are being paid $20/hour with BONUSES paid to those looting and destroying. Soros,\" reads a May 29, 2020 post on Facebook.\n\nThe text is accompanied by an image of Ellison holding a copy of \u201cAntifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook.\u201d\n\nThe claim also appears on Facebook here, here and here and on Instagram here.\n\nFloyd, 46, died when a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes in Minneapolis, Minnesota, sparking days of largely peaceful demonstrations against police brutality toward black Americans.\n\nAddressing the claim that Ellison is coordinating with Antifa, the attorney general\u2019s Deputy Chief of Staff John Stiles said in an email that the \u201callegation is pure fantasy: it is completely fabricated out of whole cloth and contains no facts whatsoever.\u201d\n\nOpen Society Foundations, a philanthropic organization funded by Soros, rejected the claim about its founder.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t fund Antifa and denounce violence of any kind, against people or property,\u201d an Open Society Foundations spokesman said by email.\n\nThe Foundations also said on Facebook: \u201cWe do not pay protesters. Neither does our founder George Soros. Claims that we do serve to delegitimize those who are exercising their Constitutionally-protected right to protest peacefully and petition their government for redress of grievances.\u201d\n\nA search of the Foundations\u2019 database detailing the grants it has awarded in 2020 does not show support for protest actions.\n\nAnd Lieutenant Gordon Shank said by email that Minnesota State Patrol is \u201cnot aware of any occurrence\u201d related to the claims in the Facebook posts.\n\nThe posts appear to be screenshots of a tweet from the @sevareidcbsnews Twitter account, giving the impression that CBS reported the information.\n\nBut Eric Sevareid of CBS News died in 1992. The account bearing his name has been suspended for violating Twitter\u2019s platform manipulation and spam policy, a company representative told AFP in an email.\n\nHowever, the image accompanying the false posts that shows Ellison holding the book on Antifa is legitimate.\n\nEllison, then US Representative for Minnesota\u2019s 5th Congressional District, tweeted the photo on January 3, 2018 with the caption: \u201cAt @MoonPalaceBooks and I just found the book that strike fear in the heart of @realDonaldTrump.\u201d\n\nThe tweet has since been deleted, but it is archived here.\n\nStiles said that \u201cas Attorney General Ellison has said on multiple occasions, he picked up a book in a Minneapolis bookstore that had a title that appealed to him and tweeted it before he had ever even heard of the anti-fascist organization.\u201d\n\nMark Bray, a historian at Rutgers university and author of \u201cAntifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,\u201d which Ellison is holding in the photo, told AFP that taking money to protest would be antithetical to anti-fascist creed.\n\n\u201cThey wouldn't accept money from millionaires and billionaires because they oppose millionaires and billionaires,\u201d Bray said by phone.\n\n\u201cThe whole \u2018George Soros is behind it\u2019 is an anti-Semitic far-right conspiracy theory that\u2019s used to slam every kind of left protest there is all over the world,\u201d he said.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked two other Antifa and George Soros-related claims here and here, as well as other false information related to Floyd and the protests here.", "lang": "en"}
