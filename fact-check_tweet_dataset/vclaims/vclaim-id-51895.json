It falsely claims the kits are from China.\n\nThe deceptive post read: \u201cTesting kits in the UK supplied by China are contaminated with coronavirus!\u201d\n\nOn March 30, The Telegraph reported that the United Kingdom could face delays in mass testing for COVID-19 after traces of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) were found in components of imported test kits. The article, which was cited by several British media outfits in their own stories, did not say the kits were supplied by China.\n\nThe Telegraph said one of the suppliers, Eurofins -- a Luxembourg-based laboratory and testing company -- informed British laboratories that parts of the testing kits called \u201cprobers and primers\u201d that have been delivered to them were contaminated with the virus. There was no mention in the story of Eurofins sourcing its products from China.\n\nThe misleading FB post was published two days after reports of European countries complaining about the accuracy of China-made testing kits surfaced. Slovakia, for one, purchased $16-million worth of kits from China but these were later found to be \u201cunable to detect COVID-19 in its early stages.\u201d Spain found some kits to have less than 30 percent accuracy in COVID-19 detection while the Netherlands rejected testing kits from China for being substandard.\n\nLikewise, Health Undersecretary Maria Vergeire said in a March 28 press briefing that some test kits sent by China only have a 40 percent accuracy. She retracted the statement two days later and clarified that a different brand had the inaccurate rating, and that the Chinese test kits the Philippines received have been assessed by the Research Institute of Tropical Medicine and have passed the World Health Organization\u2019s testing standards.\n\nThe fabricated post has 129 shares and over a hundred reactions to date.", "lang": "en"}
