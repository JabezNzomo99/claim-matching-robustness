This version of \"Home Alone 2\" has been airing on the CBC since 2014. The network said that the scene was cut for time, not political reasons.\n\nIt's true that a scene featuring Donald Trump did not appear in the CBC's 2019 Christmas season broadcast of \"Home Alone 2.\"\n\nDuring the Christmas holiday in December 2019, many people took to social media to complain that U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s cameo in the movie \u201cHome Alone 2\u201d had been omitted from its broadcast on the CBC:\n\nThis edited version of \u201cHome Alone 2\u201d was presented as if it were the result of \u201cTrump Derangement Syndrome.\u201d President Trump\u2019s son, Don Jr., called the CBC\u2019s decision to omit Trump\u2019s scene \u201cpathetic.\u201d\n\nWhile many of Trump\u2019s supporters accused the CBC of \u201ccensorship,\u201d or political bias for editing Trump out of \u201cHome Alone 2,\u201d the network offered a much more benign explanation: The movie was simply edited for time. Moreover, the edits made to this movie were done in 2014, long before Trump announced that he was launching his presidential campaign.\n\nWhen a movie makes its way from the big screen to the small screen, it frequently has to be re-edited. Scenes may be removed if they are not suitable for a television audience, or if the network has to make room for commercials. That\u2019s why many television movies are preceded with a disclaimer, stating: \u201cThis film has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit this screen and edited for content.\u201d\n\nThe CBC said in a statement that the version of \u201cHome Alone 2\u201d that aired over the Christmas holiday in 2019 was edited for time. The network added that these edits were done in 2014:\n\n\u201cAs is often the case with feature films adapted for television, Home Alone 2 was edited for time. The scene with Donald Trump was one of several that were cut from the movie as none of them were integral to the plot. These edits were done in 2014, when we first acquired the film and before Mr. Trump was elected president.\u201d\n\nThompson said that a total of about eight minutes were cut from the original theatrical release of \u201cHome Alone 2.\u201d Trump\u2019s scene was one of many that had to be cut or shortened in order to make room for commercials and to fit the CBC\u2019s allotted time slot for the movie.\n\nYou can view Trump\u2019s cameo in \u201cHome Alone 2\u201d below:\n\nIn short, while it\u2019s true that Trump\u2019s cameo in \u201cHome Alone 2\u201d did not appear in the version of the movie that aired on the CBC in December 2019, this doesn\u2019t appear to be an example of \u201cTrump Derangement Syndrome.\u201d Rather, when CBC acquired the rights to the film in 2014 (before Trump announced his presidency), the company edited the film for time.", "lang": "en"}
