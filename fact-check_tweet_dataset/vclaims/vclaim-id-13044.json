Currently, 28 countries (including the United States and Germany) are members.\n\nThe members agreed that \"an armed attack against one or more of them \u2026 shall be considered an attack against them all\" and that following such an attack, each member would take \"such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force.\"\n\nWe never heard back from Trump\u2019s team about what money Germany owes. But Trump likely was alluding to the fact Germany has not yet met the NATO target commitment for overall defense funding.\n\nAs of 2014, NATO\u2019s collective agreement directed members to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense spending by 2024. According to NATO, only five counties meet that obligation today: the United States, Greece, Estonia, Poland and the United Kingdom.\n\nAs you can see from the graphic above, Germany only pays 1.2 percent of their GDP on defense spending. German leaders have said they intend to boost military spending.\n\nThe problem with Trump\u2019s claim, however, is that Germany doesn\u2019t pay that money to NATO or the United States or any other country, said Daniel Benjamin, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\"(Germany) has, like many members, fallen short of its commitments, which is obviously not good,\" Benjamin said. \"But there is no central bank this money goes into, and there is no transaction.\"\n\nThe United States decides what level of military spending it wants to have, as do all other NATO members.\n\n\"The relatively low levels of military spending among U.S. allies is completely rational,\" said Christopher Preble, the vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. \"They don't see a pressing need to spend more.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s argument that the United States needs to be paid more also misrepresents how NATO works, experts told us.\n\n\"Trump seems to represent the NATO alliance as a licensing deal \u2014 one in which countries like Germany pay the United States for its power and influence,\" said Laicie Heeley, a military budget expert at the Stimson Center, a defense policy think tank. \"This is not the case.\"\n\nThe United States does provide an outsized military commitment to NATO, but this is not done as a favor for Europe; it\u2019s done to benefit all countries in the alliance, experts said. And the United States has several high-profile military bases in Germany that are vital, serving as a key launching point for attacks against terrorists in the Middle East.\n\nTrump said Germany \"owes vast sums of money to NATO\" and the United States \"must be paid more\" for the defense it provides to Germany.\n\nNATO members agreed to spend 2 percent of their country\u2019s GDP on defense by 2024. But that\u2019s not in payments to NATO. Each country funds its own defense, while NATO serves as an umbrella organization meant to protect all members.", "lang": "en"}
