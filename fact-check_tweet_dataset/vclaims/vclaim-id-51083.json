No, that's not true: This story originated from a satire website which publishes stories designed to troll conservatives.\n\nThe claim originated from an article (archived here) where it was published by PotatriotsUnite.com on December 8, 2019, under the title \"Michelle Obama Is The New Face of Versace Cosmetics\". It opened:\n\nBeing one of the most famous and successful women in the world seems to open new opportunities every day for former first lady Michelle Obama. Already the author of a bestselling memoir, a contract holder with mega-company Victoria's Secret, and operator of her own cruise fleet of luxury hovercraft, Mrs. O could easily buy or sell any boomer teabagger fantasizing that she is a man because of mental dumbassery. \n\n Now, Obama has signed a contract with fashion giant Versace to be the face of their cosmetic line, which was discontinued in 2009. Although the products no longer exist, the American diva will be the public face of them, because trumphumping banana-choked dumpermonkeys will absolutely be upset by it, as they are when any woman of color finds fortune. Notice there's no \"u\" in the word \"color\", Bob.\n\nAlthough PotatriotsUnite.com claims on their about page that everything on this website is fiction, they have included at least one actual fact in this story - that the Versace cosmetics line was indeed discontinued in 2009. The part about Victoria's Secret is a self-referential nod to an earlier satire story from another one of the ALLOD network sites. \"Michelle Obama To Be New Face of Victoria's Secret\" was published by Obamawatcher.com in October of 2019. Lead Stories explained that hoax in this fact-check.\n\nPotatriotsUnite is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run by self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact-checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other fact-checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction to this, he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry visible disclaimers everywhere.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past, but new ones keep cropping up.\n\n\n\nAn example of a real fake news site copying one of Blair's stories is (archived here). Blackamericannews.com published the satirical Victoria's Secret story on December 7, 2019, without any of the original disclaimers. Blackamerican.news is one of many websites from a plagiarizing publisher based in Pakistan who is targeting American audiences. Facebook has now blocked all links to Blackamerican.news, but links to many other websites from this publisher are still present on the platform.\n\nHere is a video of Blair explaining how his process works:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer, it is, of course, also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes potatriotsunite.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard, the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
