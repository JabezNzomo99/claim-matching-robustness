Is this real?\n\nOn 4 May 2016, the entertainment web site The Good Lord Above published a fake news article reporting that Ted Cruz went on a Twitter rant blaming God for his failed presidential campaign:\n\nThe above-displayed tweets were not posted on Ted Cruz\u2019 official Twitter account. They were created for a fake news article published by the entertainment web site The Good Lord Above.\n\nShortly after Cruz announced that he was suspending his campaign, he posted a thank you message to the #CruzCrew on his web site:\n\nThank you to the more than 317,000 of you who signed up to volunteer with this campaign \u2014 who made hundreds of thousands of phone calls, knocked on tens of thousands of doors, and spread the word to everyone you know in person and online. Together we assembled a grassroots army unlike anything seen in modern times.\n\nThe Good Lord Above is a humor site that makes its theme clear in its \u201cAbout\u201d page:\n\nGod made the world. Then he flooded it. Then God went to sleep for 2000 years or so. Anyway, eventually God woke up and felt pretty bad for what he\u2019d done in the past. In 2011, after years of therapy, God started his Divine God Facebook Page to restore his good name. In his infinite wisdom, in 2015 God launched this Holy Website, TheGoodLordAbove.com. TheGoodLordAbove provides news coverage of everything God does. As God created the universe, this covers everything in the known universe and all parallel universes. It\u2019s all fair game. Thou shalt remember that The First Amendment protects satire as a form of free speech and expression. TheGoodLordAbove uses invented names in all of its stories, except in cases where public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental. TheGoodLordAbove is not intended for readers under 18 years of age.\n\nPrevious stories originated from the site and were mistaken for actual news articles include the Dalai Lama stepping down to pursue a career as a sitcom writer, Donald Trump referring to Jesus as a \u201csocialist loser,\u201d and Bernie Sanders saving a dog and three children from a house fire but getting ignored by the media.", "lang": "en"}
