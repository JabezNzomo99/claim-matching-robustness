On Feb. 25, Messonnier, who is based at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s headquarters in Atlanta, gave a telephone briefing \u2014 not on camera \u2014 to reporters on the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness,\u201d she said in a clip that Klain says was the \u201cfirst to raise the alarm.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had a conversation with my family over breakfast this morning, and I told my children that while I didn\u2019t think that they were at risk right now, we as a family need to be preparing for significant disruption of our lives,\u201d Messonnier said. \u201cYou should ask your children\u2019s school about their plans for school dismissals or school closures. Ask if there are plans for teleschool. I contacted my local school superintendent this morning with exactly those questions.\u201d\n\nAt the time, more than a month after the first case had been identified in the United States, only 426 people had been tested because of a problem with CDC test kits, far fewer than in other industrialized nations. On Feb. 25, there were 57 documented cases of covid-19 in the United States. (As of March 23, about four weeks later, there are more than 46,000 cases in the United States.)\n\nIndeed, just a day before, Schuchat had participated in a televised news conference of the coronavirus task force, where her message was similar to what Messonnier said, if not quite as stark: \u201cIt\u2019s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen, and how many people in this country will become infected? And how many of those will develop severe or more complicated disease?\u201d\n\nBefore Feb. 25, Messonnier had appeared in 13 telebriefings over six weeks, often issuing warnings. \u201cThe goal of the measures we have taken to date are to slow the introduction and impact of this disease in the United States but at some point, we are likely to see community spread in the U.S.,\u201d she said on Feb. 12. \u201cThis will require the effort of all levels of government, the public health system and our communities as we face these challenges together.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post reported on March 19 that the CDC\u2019s public voice has been sidelined in recent weeks, in part because the White House briefings kept conflicting with plans for CDC briefings. CDC Director Robert Redfield and \u201cSchuchat have testified before Congress and briefed members in closed sessions,\u201d The Post said. \u201cBut top CDC officials have rarely appeared on camera or been quoted in media interviews in recent weeks.\u201d The article said Redfield participates in task force meetings, splitting his time between Atlanta and Washington.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump neglected and lied about the coronavirus outbreak time and time again, disregarding warnings from his own medical and intelligence experts and downplaying the threat to the public. He was outraged that Dr. Messonnier didn\u2019t follow his example and instead told the American people the truth,\u201d said Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates. \u201cAnd after this incident she appeared in no more briefings with Sec. Azar, a core member of the White House task force. Our assertion about her treatment is backed up by the statement of the former head of the CDC, who said, \u2018Nancy Messonnier told it like it is. And she was 100 percent right, and they silenced the messenger.\u2019\u201d\n\nMessonnier continued to hold her regular telephone briefings with reporters for another two weeks. The task force briefings moved to the White House after Pence was named to head the task force, but Messonnier was not a regular participant and she appears not to have been senior enough to share the stage with the president. And although the CDC\u2019s voice has been muted in recent weeks, that development does not appear related to her Feb. 25 comments.\n\nWe concede that news reports indicate Trump was upset by her remarks \u2014 and that there are signs he is tired of warnings from scientists and doctors as the economy implodes. He has certainly lashed out at people who have disagreed with him or given him information that conflicted with his point of view. We\u2019ve documented Trump\u2019s many false or misleading claims about the coronavirus outbreak.", "lang": "en"}
