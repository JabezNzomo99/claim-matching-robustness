While quoting an unnamed member of PM House staff, ANI reported that Pakistan\u2019s first lady\u2019s image does not appear in mirrors. The report was based on a screenshot of Pakistan\u2019s Capital TV which reads, \u201c\u067e\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0645 \u06c1\u0627\u0624\u0633 \u06a9\u06d2 \u0679\u0627\u0641 \u06a9\u06d2 \u0645\u0637\u0627\u0628\u0642 \u062e\u0627\u062a\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0648\u0644 \u06a9\u0627 \u0622\u0626\u06cc\u0646\u06d2 \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u0639\u06a9\u0633 \u0646\u0638\u0631 \u0646\u06c1\u06cc\u06ba \u0622\u062a\u0627 (According to PM House staff, Image of the first lady not seen be seen in the mirror.)\u201d\n\nThe article which was also tweeted by ANI editor Smita Prakash is now deleted. After taking it down, ANI published another article titled, \u201cTwitterati divided over reports that Pakistan PM Imran Khan\u2019s wife Bushra Bibi\u2019s image doesn\u2019t form in mirrors.\u201d\n\nHere they claimed, \u201cEven as some Pakistani journalists alleged that the picture is photoshopped, a Pakistani source said that the news was actually run by the tv channel before being pulled off-air.\u201d\n\nWhat is the truth? Did Capital TV report any such news?\n\nWhile searching for the report by Capital TV, Alt News came across several tweets by the channel calling out ANI and denying that they had published any such report. In one of the tweets, Capital TV blamed ANI and their \u201cirresponsible journalism\u201d for using a \u201cphotoshopped poster\u201d with Capital TV\u2019s template.\n\nIn another tweet,Capital TV claimed that their administration had already filed a complaint with the FIA about a fake poster when it was circulated a year ago. While speaking to the anchor, Director of Capital TV, Naushad Ali had mentioned that they had filed a complaint with FIA Cyber Crime Wing last year.\n\nWhile searching for older reports, Alt News came across a tweet by a Journalist Aniqa Nisar ofCapital TV on Oct 1, 2018, saying no such news was aired by the channel. She had also tweeted that they had filed a complaint with FIA Cyber Crime Wing.\n\nWe found another 2018 tweet by Capital TV which shared a copy of the complaint in FIA\u2018s Cyber-Crime Wing against those \u201cspreading false and absurd news\u201d.\n\nMisinformation by ANI later picked up by several media outlets\n\nTimes Now had published an article with a similar headline, \u201cPakistan PM Imran Khan\u2019s wife Bushra bibi\u2019s reflection can\u2019t be seen in a mirror, claims report.\u201d\n\nTimes Now also published an article in Hindi.\n\nBoth their reports have been updated without a clarification that the channel had earlier published misinformation.\n\nSeveral other Hindi media outlets had also carried similar stories \u2013 Aaj Tak, Dainik Jagran, Amar Ujala, TV9 Bharatvarsh and Loksatta. The Indian Express published a report in Bengali based on the ANI article.\n\nThe misinformation was also shared by propaganda website OpIndiaand MyNation. The former later modified their report, including its title.\n\nIn conclusion, a piece of misinformation travelled in the media and subsequently to millions of viewers after a misinformed report was published by ANI and later picked up by other media outlets.", "lang": "en"}
