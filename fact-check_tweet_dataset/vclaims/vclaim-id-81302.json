Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.). As you can see, the crowd is quite taken aback by one his assertions \u2014 that President Obama proposes to give $24,000 to \u201ceach illegal alien.\u201d Then he goes onto to say that the second-largest part of the Mexican gross domestic product consists of benefits from Social Security.\n\nFirst, regarding the $24,000, Gosar is referring to the fact that Obama\u2019s executive action shielding about 4 million immigrants from deportation \u2014 currently temporarily suspended because of an adverse judicial ruling \u2014 would allow illegal immigrants to receive Social Security numbers. With those numbers, they could file amended tax returns for the last three years claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit. (Gosar called it the \u201chousehold deferred tax credit,\u201d but he meant the EITC.)\n\nA Treasury Department spokesman confirmed that such retroactive claims would be possible, but likely would be cumbersome and possibly costly. \u201cFiling original returns for prior years would likely be difficult, since filers would have to reconstruct earnings and other records for years when they were not able to work on the books,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cIn addition, in order to claim the EITC, these households would need to report income which may result in them owing taxes.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Gosar claimed that every illegal would get $24,000, when that is the maximum possible. The Treasury spokesman said few would qualify for that amount: \u201cThe maximum credit is only available to taxpayers with three or more children and who are within a specific income range \u2014 only about 12 percent of EITC recipients report having three or more children, and many of these individuals have incomes that would not qualify for the maximum credit.\u201d (See figure H in this report.)\n\nThe Fact Checker obviously takes no position on what foes of immigration are calling \u201camnesty bonuses.\u201d But it should be noted \u2014 as the Associated Press did in an article on the issue \u2014 that illegal immigrants have been paying into Social Security already. Stephen Goss, Social Security\u2019s chief actuary, told the AP that over the past decade, illegal immigrants have paid $100 billion in Social Security payroll taxes, even though until now they could not hope to claim any benefits after retirement.\n\nBut Gosar really went off the rails when he claimed that Social Security and other benefits made up the second-biggest part of Mexico\u2019s gross domestic product. It took days to get an answer, but Smith said that Gosar was talking about remittances and their impact on the Mexican economy.\n\nAs Emilly Litella would say, \u201cNever mind.\u201d That\u2019s a big difference. We had not been able to find any evidence that Social Security played much of a role in the Mexican economy, especially since an agreement that would allow Mexicans who have earned benefits to receive them in Mexico has not been ratified by Congress.\n\nEven then, remittances \u2014 transfers of money by a foreign worker to an individual in his or her home country \u2014 are not the second-biggest contributor to Mexico\u2019s GDP, but just 2 percent. Indeed, in terms of remittances as a share of GDP, Mexico is in the middle of the pack among Latin American countries.\n\nMexico received $24 billion in remittances in 2014, but according to the World Bank, that places it fourth in terms of total amount. India received $71 billion in remittances, China $64 billion and the Philippines $28 billion. The World Bank pays close attention to these numbers because remittances are considered a good thing for a nation\u2019s economy; countries with high inflows of remittances are permitted to borrow more.\n\nIn the first quote, Gosar would have been on more solid ground if he had been clear that he was talking about the maximum that an illegal immigrant might receive from the EITC \u2014 and that few would qualify to receive this amount. Instead, he portrayed it as a cash payment to every illegal worker covered by Obama\u2019s action. Contrary to Smith\u2019s explanation, he did not imply anything else \u2014 and in fact, he asserted \u201cyep, absolutely\u201d when an audience member expressed surprise.\n\nRemittances are a different story, and one can certainly have an opinion on whether that fuels immigration, illegal or otherwise. But that\u2019s not what Gosar said. He said that Social Security and other benefits represent the second-biggest part of the GDP, when instead he supposedly meant to say that remittances are 2 percent of Mexico\u2019s GDP.", "lang": "en"}
