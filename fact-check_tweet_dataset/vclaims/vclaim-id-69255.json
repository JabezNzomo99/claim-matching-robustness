Scott Walker\u2019s Department of Administration, and Bob Lang, director of the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, confirmed that the Director of State Courts office has leased space across from the Capitol, in the Tenney Plaza building at 110 E. Main St. in Madison, since 1974.\n\nThe landlord is Tenney LLC. The owner is Urban Land Investments Inc.\n\nIt\u2019s been a bipartisan pattern. That span covers the administrations of eight governors -- four Democrats (Patrick Lucey, Martin Schreiber, Anthony Earl and Jim Doyle) and four Republicans (Lee Dreyfus, Tommy Thompson, Scott McCallum and Walker).\n\nAdamczyk provided lease documents showing that the Department of Administration most recently renewed the lease in January 2017. It\u2019s a five-year lease, for 57,215 square feet, that started in October 2017. The first year\u2019s rent is $1.35 million. With annual increases of 1.75 percent, the lease payment for the fifth year will be $1.45 million.\n\nA few points before we close:\n\u2022 Lang and Michels told us that a renegotiation for the current lease produced a 23 percent reduction in the rent there, saving about $2.5 million.\n\u2022 Adamczyk hasn\u2019t spelled out where in a state-owned building the courts agency might go, what the savings might be and what other issues would come with owning rather than renting.\n\u2022 As part of a separate branch of government, the courts agency generally has the authority to choose its own office space, Michels said.\n\nRailing against the state leasing office space as being too expensive, Adamczyk says the state courts agency \"basically\" has rented the same office space across from the Capitol \"since 1974.\"\n\nHe\u2019s correct, although he doesn\u2019t offer evidence indicating there is a viable alternative for the agency that would save money.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
