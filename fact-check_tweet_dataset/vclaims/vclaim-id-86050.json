Nick Rahall (D-W.V.) uses a miner to put words in the mouth of his opponent.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-05-15T18:24:21Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-86050", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/09/24/a-sleazy-attack-puts-words-in-other-candidates-mouth/", "vclaim": "The ad posits a contrast: Rahall \u201cpassed legislation to expand black lung benefits,\u201d while Jenkins \u201cwill vote to roll back and deny black lung benefits for miners.\u201d Then it has Counts make the devastating claim that he\u2019s heard Jenkins \u201csay that he\u2019s gonna take away our black lung benefits.\u201d\n\nBlack lung disease is the popular term for coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis, which comes from lengthy exposure to coal dust. Since 1969, the federal government has provided benefits for workers totally disabled by the disease, as well as survivors and dependents.\n\nThe black lung legislation that Rahall touts? That\u2019s actually a vote for the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, but apparently it\u2019s dangerous to mention that law by name in a red-leaning state. (The ad simply identifies it as \u201cHR 3590, Votes #165, 3/21/10.\u201d)\n\nThe late Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) had slipped language in the ACA that made it easier for miners who had worked at least 15 years in the mines to qualify for black lung benefits by shifting the burden on the mining company to prove the miner did not have the disease; previously miners had to prove they had it. Byrd also made it easier for survivors to retain the benefits if the miner dies. These provisions, known as the Byrd Amendments, had existed in the Black Lung Benefits Act but had been eliminated in 1981.\n\nYou can see where this is going. Because Jenkins is on record as favoring repeal of the Affordable Care Act, Randall assumes that means he would throw out the enhanced Black Lung Act benefits, as well. Not only that, Rahall appears to assume Jenkins would strip away all black lung benefits. Yet Jenkins, on his Web site, says he is \u201cfirmly opposed to any cuts to the Federal Black Lung Benefit Program.\u201d Indeed, Jenkins says he wants to replace the health care law \u2014 and it is reasonable presumption that, as a West Virginia lawmaker, he would seek to retain the Byrd Amendments in the new law.\n\nBut the ad really goes off the rails when, in the voice of a sympathetic coal miner, the ad pointblank says that Jenkins has made elimination of black lung benefits part of his campaign platform: \u201cWhen I hear Evan Jenkins say that he\u2019s gonna take away our black lung benefits, it just bothers me to no end.\u201d\n\nBut even if the ACA were repealed, along with the Byrd Amendments, this particular coal miner wouldn\u2019t lose his benefits, since he already had them. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to assume the miner\u2019s state of mind \u2013 he\u2019s empathizing with other miners who would have even more trouble receiving benefits if the ACA were repealed,\u201d a Rahall spokesman countered.\n\nBut more to the point, Jenkins never said he was going to take away black lung benefits. The miner \u2014 and the ad \u2014 simply puts words in Jenkins\u2019s mouth.\n\nThe Rahall campaign takes one relatively small aspect of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 though one that\u2019s important to West Virginia voters \u2014 and assumes repeal would means throwing out every aspect of the law. It ignores the fact that Jenkins says he would seek to keep the black lung provisions in any new law, and it leaves the distinct impression that Jenkins wants to eliminate all black lung benefits. That\u2019s highly misleading.", "lang": "en"}
