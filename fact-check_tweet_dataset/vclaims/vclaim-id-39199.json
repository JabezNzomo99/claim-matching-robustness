The virus is 50-200 nanometres wide, and a mask, although sometimes necessary, won\u2019t guarantee that you don\u2019t get Covid-19. The new coronavirus does not settle in the air but is grounded so it is not transmitted by air. The virus can spread via sneeze and cough droplets that can move a short distance through the air and into someone else\u2019s system. Coronavirus lives on the hands for 10 minutes, but can be prevented with alcohol hand sanitiser. It\u2019s not clear how long the virus can \u2018survive\u2019 on hands, but hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol is a good second choice to washing your hands with soap and water. We don\u2019t know how long the virus can survive on surfaces yet, it could be between hours and days. Gargling with warm and salt water kills germs on the tonsils and prevents them from leaking into the lungs. There\u2019s no evidence gargling with saline will cure or prevent Covid-19. If the new coronavirus is exposed to a temperature of 26-27\u00baC it will be killed, as it does not live in hot regions. Also drinking hot water and sun exposure will do the trick and staying away from ice cream and cold food is advised. There have been cases of Covid-19 in areas with warmer temperatures than this, and we don\u2019t know what temperatures the virus can withstand. There\u2019s no evidence that hot water and the sun will cure it or that staying away from cold food can prevent it. Coronavirus stays on fabric for 9 hours, so washing clothes or being exposed to the sun for two hours meets the purpose of killing it. We don\u2019t know how long the virus can survive on fabric. There isn\u2019t evidence that it can transmit from fabrics to people, though soiled clothing from Covid-19 patients should be washed normally.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen a number of tweets showing graphics which make claims about the new coronavirus. The graphics have Unicef branding and are reportedly spreading on WhatsApp.\n\nUnicef in the Philippines has said that the graphics are not from them. Most of the claims here are unevidenced or just plain false.\n\nThe claims seem to have been lifted from a Facebook post which we have checked before. The original text of the post, which has been edited since we first fact checked it, makes some of the same claims about the symptoms of Covid-19 and ways to prevent the disease.\n\nIt seems that at one point, MSN had an article on its website repeating the claims and attributing them to Unicef though the article has now been deleted.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) calls the disease itself Covid-19, and the virus that causes it SARS-CoV-2, and we will use that naming system here.\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus itself is around 50-200 nanometres wide. \u201cAny mask\u201d will not prevent you catching it. The WHO says masks are only effective when combined with regular hand washing. Viruses like this can enter through the eyes even if you\u2019re wearing a mask.\n\nIt\u2019s not completely obvious what this means. The virus that causes Covid-19 certainly can spread through cough and sneeze droplets in the air, which can in turn enter someone else\u2019s system.\n\nAs we\u2019ve said before, it\u2019s not clear exactly how long the virus can \u2018survive\u2019 on your hands, especially not down to the minute. Using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser is a good way to prevent the virus from spreading, if washing your hands with soap and water isn\u2019t possible.\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly how long the virus can last on surfaces yet. The WHO says \u201cStudies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days.\n\nIt\u2019s still good advice to wash your hands regularly with soap and water.\n\nAs we\u2019ve written about before, gargling with salt water is recommended by the NHS for adults who have a sore throat, but only to relieve symptoms once you have caught it, not as a preventative measure. The WHO has said that there\u2019s no evidence saline can prevent Covid-19.\n\nOther fact checkers have also written about this claim, which was attributed to respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan, a key figure during the SARS outbreak. The hospital where he worked debunked the rumour via a post on social media site Weibo.\n\nWe don\u2019t yet know what temperatures the virus can withstand, but it\u2019s worth noting that several of the countries with confirmed cases have warmer climates where the temperature can reach 27\u00baC. Sun exposure is therefore unlikely to protect you from or cure Covid-19. There\u2019s no official advice from the NHS, WHO or CDC to stay away from cold food like ice cream or drink hot water to kill the virus.\n\nWe don\u2019t know how long the new virus can last on fabric, especially this soon after it was discovered. In a blogpost, Harvard Medical School\u2019s instructor in medicine Todd Ellerin writes: \u201cSo far, available evidence suggests it can be transmitted less easily from soft surfaces than frequently-touched hard surfaces.\u201d\n\nThe CDC advises that soiled clothing from Covid-19 patients should be handled with disposable gloves, but can be washed using normal detergent. There\u2019s absolutely no evidence that leaving clothes in the sun can kill the virus.", "lang": "en"}
