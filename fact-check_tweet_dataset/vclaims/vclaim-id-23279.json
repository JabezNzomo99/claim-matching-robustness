For this very reason peoples of other faiths have been afforded asylum, prosperity, and freedom of worship here.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Henry authored this statement. It actually comes from a 1956 article mentioning his Christian faith, published in \u201cThe Virginian\u201d magazine.\n\nHenry is most famous for his influential 1775 speech in which he urged Virginians to prepare for war with Great Britain, allegedly declaring, \u201cGive me liberty or give me death!\u201d He served five terms as governor of Virginia, from 1776 to 1779 and again from 1784 to 1786.\n\nContrary to the claims of the Facebook post, Henry was not a ratifier of the U.S. Constitution. He refused to attend the 1787 Constitutional Convention and strongly opposed the document\u2019s ratification, believing that it insufficiently protected individual and states\u2019 rights.

The Library of Virginia provided The Daily Caller with a copy of this article.\n\nThe article quotes Henry\u2019s will, which in one part states, \u201cThis is all the Inheritance I can give to my dear family, The religion of Christ can give them one which will make them rich indeed.\u201d\n\nHenry died in 1799 at his home, Virginia\u2019s Red Hill plantation.", "lang": "en"}
