A former officer of the Indian army and a newly-inducted member of the BJP, Major Surendra Poonia was among those who shared the photograph. He also shared an image of Congress MP Digvijay Singh with Zakir Naik in an attempt to link an alleged terrorist with the Congress party.\n\nFrom a Twitter handle Chowkidar, The Activist (@AhmAsmiYodha), the post received nearly 4,000 retweets. He addressed controversial Islamic preacher Zakir Naik as \u201cCongress party\u2019s maternal uncle.\u201d\n\nImages of the same man posing with Naik are viral on Facebook as well.\n\nThe man photographed with Zakir Naik is not one of the suicide bombers of the Sri Lanka terrorist attack. He is an Islamic preacher and Naik\u2019s disciple. Reverse-searching the image with the keyword \u201cZakir Naik\u201d redirected us to an article published in Malaysia-based newspaper Malaymailon April 28. The man is Muhammad Zamri Vinoth Kalimuthu who was arrested in Perlis, Malaysia on Sunday for alleged blasphemous remarks on Hinduism.\n\n\u201cA brief video said to show Zamri Vinoth being taken into custody was posted on Facebook this morning by Seberang Perai Municipal City Councillor David Marshel,\u201d reported Malaymail.\n\nThere are several other photographs of Zamri with Naik on the former\u2019s Twitter account.\n\nAll nine suicide bombers were identified as Sri Lanka citizens. Zamri is a Malaysian who was arrested on April 28 hence, could not have been a suicide bomber in the Sri Lanka terror attack.", "lang": "en"}
