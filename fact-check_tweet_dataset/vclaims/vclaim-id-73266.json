The posts are misleading: the photos are unrelated to the Christchurch attack and have circulated widely online since 2016 or 2018.\n\nThis Facebook post contains three photos of women in hijabs and has been shared more than 27,000 times since it was first posted on March 17, 2019.\n\nThe caption states: \u201cDo you know.. They killed 50 Muslims while praying yesterday and today over 350 accepted Islam in New Zealand\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe post was shared two days after 50 worshippers in two mosques were shot dead in the city of Christchurch, New Zealand, on March 15. An Australian man has been charged over the murders. Here is an AFP report from March 20 about the incident.\n\nThe same photos and claim was posted on a page entitled \u2018Die for Islam\u2019 here on March 18, 2019. The post has been shared more than 1,400 times.\n\nAFP established that one of the photos, in which a woman is pictured wearing a pale hijab and glasses, was not captured in New Zealand by conducting a reverse image search on Google.\n\nThe photo appeared in a news story published by the Arkansas Democrat Gazette on February 15, 2016.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the article:\n\nThe photo caption reads: \u201cNancy Allen of Conway wears a hijab, a head covering worn by Muslim women, to show support for them and for freedom of religion. Allen said she has gotten much more positive feedback than negative. - Photo by Kelvin Green.\u201d\n\nAFP established that another image included in the post, which features a woman wearing in a dark blue hijab and a beige coat, has appeared online on multiple web pages since at least January 2018.\n\nHere is a screenshot of some of the results from a reverse image search of the photo on Google on March 20, 2019:\n\nThis article, published on medium.com on January 31, 2018, included the same photo alongside an advert for hijabs for sale.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the article:\n\nThe same photo was used by the same Medium author in articles here and here later in 2018.\n\nThrough the same reverse image search process, AFP established the third image of a woman wearing a black hijab has appeared online since at least July 2018.\n\nThe image was used in a Facebook post here on July 24, 2018.\n\nHere is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe same image was used with an identical caption here in a Facebook post shared on November 22, 2018.\n\nExcept for the photos, none of the misleading posts offered any evidence to support the claim that 350 people in New Zealand had accepted Islam after the attacks.", "lang": "en"}
