In the viral video, various images have been displayed with the sound of \u2018OM\u2019 being audible. Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral post is misleading. Yes, NASA admitted that Sun can be heard, it produces sound, but definitely not \u2018Om\u2019.\n\nThe viral post is shared all across social media claiming that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) recorded the sun\u2019s sound and sun chants \u2018Om\u2019. The post is shared on Facebook by a user named Sandeep Anaberu. The post is viral across social media. You can view the archived version of the post here.\n\nVishvas News investigated and found the original video released by NASA on the research they had conducted on Sun\u2019s sound.\n\nAs per the official website of NASA, data from ESA (European Space Agency) and NASA\u2019s Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) has captured the dynamic movement of the Sun\u2019s atmosphere for over 20 years.\n\nData from SOHO, sonified by the Stanford Experimental Physics Lab, captures the Sun\u2019s natural vibrations and provides scientists with a concrete representation of its dynamic movements.\n\nHere is the Sun sonification (raw audio) as shared by NASA:\n\nNASA recorded the solar sounds generated from 40 days of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory\u2019s (SOHO) Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) data and processed by A. Kosovichev, according to NASA\u2019s website.\n\nThese vibrations allow scientists to study a range of complex motions inside the Sun, from solar flares to coronal mass ejections.\n\nThe sound of the sun shared by NASA does not match with the sound shared in the viral post. The Sun does not chant Om as evident in the report on NASA\u2019s official website.\n\nWe also found a tweet on the official twitter handle of NASA shared in 2018. In the tweet, it was mentioned: \u201cThe Sun is not silent. The low, pulsing hum of our star\u2019s heartbeat allows scientists to peer inside, revealing huge rivers of solar material flowing, along with waves, loops, and eruptions. This helps scientists study what can\u2019t be seen.\u201d\n\nNASA has not made any statement with the sound of Sun similar to OM.\n\nVishvas News contacted NASA regarding the same and the Ames Public Inquiries department of NASA reverted by sharing the link of the report published in 2018 on the Sounds of Sun and that NASA has not recorded OM as the sun\u2019s sound.\n\nConclusion: The video claiming that NASA has recorded sun\u2019s sound and sun has chanted Om is misleading. Yes, NASA admitted that Sun can be heard, it produces sound, but definitely not \u2018Om\u2019 as claimed in the viral post.", "lang": "en"}
