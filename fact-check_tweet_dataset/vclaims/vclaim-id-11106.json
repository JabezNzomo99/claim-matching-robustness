One person can cross into the EU multiple times, particularly if they\u2019re travelling across parts of south eastern Europe. It\u2019s thought that these detections are associated with around one million people.\n\nThe organisation which compiles and publishes the figures\u2014the EU\u2019s border agency Frontex\u2014says that:\n\n\u201cIrregular border crossings may be attempted by the same person several times in different locations at the external border. This means that a large number of those who were counted when they arrived in Greece were again counted when entering the EU for the second time through Hungary or Croatia.\u201d\n\nThis has a significant effect on the figures. Of the 1.8 million detected crossings, 885,000 were through the eastern Mediterranean, mostly from Turkey into Greece. Another 765,000 crossings were detected through the western Balkans into countries like Hungary and Croatia.\n\nIt\u2019s well known this is a big route for migrants entering Europe from the Middle East, since the majority who enter Greece don\u2019t apply for asylum there, according to Frontex.\n\nFrontex itself says these 1.8 million detections correspond with an estimated one million migrants entering Europe in 2015. We\u2019ve asked Frontex for its source here. A similar figure has been estimated by the UN and the International Organisation for Migration.\n\nEven though there aren\u2019t as many people as detections, 2015 was an unprecedented year for arrivals into the EU as today\u2019s reports suggest. Those 1.8 million detections compare to less than 300,000 in 2014 and just over 100,000 in 2013.\n\nAt the same time the number of detections is only as good as the amount of effort member states spend monitoring the flow of migrants illegally into the EU. There\u2019s no way to know exactly how many people have entered the EU illicitly.\n\nEven though the 1.8 million figure has been widely reported today, we knew there were roughly this many detections in 2015 back in January this year.", "lang": "en"}
