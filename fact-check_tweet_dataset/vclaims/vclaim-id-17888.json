No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to educate gullible Trump supporters and Republicans about the need to actually click and read links before sharing or liking them in order to avoid being embarrassed by fans of the site later. All the events described in the article are not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by America's Last Line of Defense on December 29, 2018 titled \"BREAKING: President Trump Orders Drug Tests for All Members of Congress\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nPresident Trump has issued an 11th-hour order to all incoming members of Congress to stop at an approved facility before the swearing-in ceremony this weekend for a mandatory drug test. According to federal law, the Chief Executive is in charge of employment protocols for every branch of government, meaning he has the right and the power to force mandatory drug testing. According to White House Director of Information and Propaganda, Art Tubolls, the move isn't only legal, it's necessary: \"We have several members of Congress openly addicted to bloogies. If it spreads, we're looking at our own lawmakers working for themselves instead of the people. That's not how government works. Therefore, anyone who fails the mandatory test for opiates, cocaine, marijuana, bloogies, and quaaludes will be fired and replaced with an appointee of Trump's choosing.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail so they wouldn't have seen the type of site it originated from:\n\nThere are several hints the story is false. First, there is no such drug as \"bloogies\" and \"Art Tubbols\" is just an anagram for \"Busta Troll\", the nickname of the owner of the site. The story was also posted under the category \"BREAKING SATIRE\".\n\nThe site comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including potatriotpost.us, dailyworldupdate.us and nofakenewsonline.us. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nBlair and his operation were profiled by the Washington Post on November 17, 2018 by Eli Saslow:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes wearethellod.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
