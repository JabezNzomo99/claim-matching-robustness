But Democrats still received 43 percent of the Wall Street money going to congressional candidates.\n\nPelosi\u2019s denial of reality came in response to a comment made at the CNN town hall event. Questioner William Marsh, a steel-company executive, suggested that blue-collar, Midwestern \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d had abandoned the party because they believe it no longer represents their values.\n\nWilliam Marsh, Jan. 31: A lot of these workers feel that the core interest groups of the party do not represent their values. For example, the abortion rights activists, the environmental activists, Wall Street, Wall Street lawyers. Marsh: Yes, a lot of Wall Street supports the Democrat Party now and not the Republican Party. Pelosi: They don\u2019t support me. \u2026No, we don\u2019t get much support from Wall Street.\n\nTo check Pelosi\u2019s claim, we turned to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign money and categorizes it by industry. We selected totals for commercial bankers and for securities and investment firms (which include hedge funds, private equity firms and venture-capital firms) as falling under the general heading of \u201cWall Street.\u201d The donations can come from individuals, political action committees, or both.\n\nPerhaps Pelosi doesn\u2019t consider $47 million to be \u201cmuch,\u201d but it\u2019s more than the $44 million that Democratic congressional candidates received during the same period from labor union PACs and officials.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t stop there. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee \u2014 a party organization devoted to electing and re-electing Democrats to the House \u2014 received $4,799,059 from securities and investment firms and their employees in the last election. And the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee got $6,676,941 from the securities and investment industry, making it the fourth largest industry source for the DSCC, according to the Center for Responsive Politics\u2019 tallies.\n\nAs for Pelosi\u2019s claim that Wall Street donors \u201cdon\u2019t support me,\u201d those in the securities and investment industry actually have contributed more than $1 million to her re-election campaigns since 1989, the third highest total from any industry group, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nAnd it\u2019s still coming in. Her 2016 re-election campaign received $83,280 from securities and investment firm PACs and employees, and $20,930 from commercial bankers, for a total of more than $104,000.\n\nIn addition, Pelosi\u2019s personal PAC \u2014 \u201cPAC to the Future\u201d \u2014 took in $44,500 from securities and investment sources, and $13,500 from commercial bankers.\n\nThose totals are small fractions of the $4.2 million she raised for her 2016 re-election, and the $1.1 million raised by her PAC for the 2016 campaign. But they are \u201csupport\u201d nonetheless.\n\nUpdate, Feb. 2: After this story was posted, Drew Hammill, a Pelosi spokesman, contacted us to say, \u201cLeader Pelosi spearheaded the passage of historic Dodd-Frank reforms that put the needs on Main Street ahead of Wall Street. There\u2019s only one party that\u2019s working hand in hand with corporate lobbyists to undo these critical reforms and that\u2019s the Republican Party.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
