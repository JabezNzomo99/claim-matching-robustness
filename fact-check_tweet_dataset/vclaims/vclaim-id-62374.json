Alt News has also received fact-check requests on its official mobile application.\n\nA reverse-image search of the photographs took us to a report by The Lallantop published on June 22, 2019. According to the report, a 19-year-old girl was murdered in Rajasthan\u2019s Karauli district. On June 20, she had left her home for defecation and was later found hanging from a tree in another village. The doctor who conducted her post-mortem ruled out rape.\n\nAs per a report published by Dainik Bhaskar on June 22, the girl died after her throat was strangulated. The PM report did not hint at rape. The report said, \u201cInitial police investigation speculated a lovers\u2019 spat as the motive behind the crime. The police found the footprints of a person on a far below a field where the deceased\u2019s slippers were also found at a distance of 100 feet from the scene of the crime. On the other side, the shoe prints of the pressure applied to kill the girl were found.\n\nA follow-up report published by Dainik Bhaskar on June 26 said that the police arrested Mahendra Mina and the motive behind the murder was a lovers\u2019 spat. Mina killed the girl to get rid of her and later tied her dead body from a tree.\n\nPhotographs of a year-old incident were shared on social media with the false claim that a Muslim man named Naseer Khan raped and murdered an 8-year-old girl in Rajasthan. The police had arrested Mahendra Mina in connection with the crime. Furthermore, the girl was not a minor but 19 years old.", "lang": "en"}
