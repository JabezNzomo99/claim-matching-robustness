The MLC told us the image was photoshopped and suspected the Bharatiya Janata Party's IT cell for creating the fake. BOOM cannot independently verify who created the fake image.\n\nYadav also shared both photos on his Twitter and Facebook accounts stating the original photo was from December 31, 2018.\n\nBOOM looked for photos online that matched the time period as claimed by Yadav, and found several posts from December 31, 2018 sharing the same image.\n\nWe compared the images and found the original one had indeed been tampered with.\n\nThe first sentence on the fake billboard is edited with its font visibly different from the rest of the message.\n\nAccording to Yadav, the original post was a new year message for the party chief. The message, in Hindi, \u0928\u0935 \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937 \u0915\u0940 \u0939\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0915 \u0938\u0902\u092d\u093e\u0935\u0928\u093e \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0905\u0916\u093f\u0932\u0947\u0936 \u092f\u093e\u0926\u0935, translates to - 'Heartiest possibility for the new year Mr Akhilesh Yadav.\n\nSimilarly, the message with the fake image - \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0927\u093e\u0928\u092e\u0902\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u092c\u0928\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0940 \u0939\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0915 \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092d\u093e\u0935\u0928\u093e \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0905\u0916\u093f\u0932\u0947\u0936 \u092f\u093e\u0926\u0935 - translates to - 'Heartiest possibility of becoming the prime minister Mr Akhilseh Yadav.'\n\nNot the first time it's viral\n\nThe original image that was shared by the MLC on December 31, 2018, was also viral on social media back then.\n\nSeveral users had shared the image with sarcastic captions.\n\nSeveral Facebook pages and Twitter handles including journalists have shared the photoshopped picture.\n\nClick here for an archived version of the post.", "lang": "en"}
