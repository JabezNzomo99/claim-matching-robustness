JOMA GUSTONG PAALISIN SI DUTERTE AT IPALIT SI LENI!!\" and \"BREAKING NEWS: JOMA GUSTONG PAALISIN SI DUTERTE AT IPALIT SI LENI\" (Joma wants to oust Duterte and replace him with Leni), the story carried as its content an 11-minute clip of an hour-and-a-half long June 29 CNN Philippines newscast, uploaded by Youtube channel Tokhang TV with the title \"J0MA GUSTONG MAGKUDETA. KAY LENI NA MAKIKIPAG-USAP. (Joma wants a coup. Will talk to Leni instead.).\"\n\nIn the video, Sison - as chief political consultant of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines - was quoted as saying in a June 28 statement that the NDFP could no longer negotiate with Duterte and that it would \u201crelatively be easier and more productive\u201d for the group to join the Oust Duterte movement.\n\nSison added the NDFP should prepare instead for peace negotiations \"with the prospective administration that replaces the Duterte regime.\"\n\nThe communist leader, however, made no mention of Robredo in his statement.\n\nThe online post, which could have reached more than 901,000 people, was published a day after the peace talks between the government and communist rebels were supposed to resume, after having been thrice postponed. On June 14, Peace Secretary Jesus Dureza announced the June 28 meeting would no longer push through, saying Duterte wanted to engage with the public first before coming up with agreements with the NDFP.\n\nTraffic to the story was largely generated from social media by Facebook pages President Digong News, President Duterte Loyal Supporters, and Ako Ang Media Ni Duterte. Aboutdu30.info was created on June 26; duterteonline.info on June 1; republika.top on April 13; and Youtube channel Tokhang TV in November 2016.", "lang": "en"}
