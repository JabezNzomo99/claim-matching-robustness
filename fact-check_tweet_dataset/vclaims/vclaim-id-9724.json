Facebook groups such as Gun Owners of Merica and Twitter accounts circulated images and GIFs of Gonzalez tearing down the middle of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nTwitter users, including Don Moynihan, a professor of government at University of Wisconsin-Madison, quickly pointed out that the images and GIFs were doctored.\n\nThe original image was taken from a video by Teen Vogue that appeared alongside an op-ed written by Gonzalez entitled \"Why This Generation Needs Gun Control.\"\n\nIn the real video, Gonzalez is ripping up a gun-range target poster.\n\nOne of the accounts sharing the fake images \u2014 \"Linda the NRA Supporter\" \u2014 was suspended sometime after the posts.\n\nBut multiple other Twitter accounts (including Adam Baldwin from the tweet above) have shared the posts in the name of political satire.\n\nGab, \"A free speech social network,\" tweeted the doctored GIF of Gonzalez ripping what looks like the Constitution, and then declared it was clearly \"satire\" shortly after.\n\nDespite this admission, the original post from Gab was retweeted more than 1,500 times and liked over 3,000 times.\n\nThese fake images of Gonzalez ripping up the U.S. Constitution are doctored.
