The image appears to be a doctored version of a genuine BBC News story.\n\nThe image being shared appears to show a screen grab of a BBC News article, purportedly published under the outlet\u2019s \u201cUK, England\u201d section on July 11, that puts up the headline \u201cGhislaine Maxwell moved to intensive care as Coronavirus symptoms worsen.\u201d At the time the image was posted, the article\u2019s alleged publication date was still over five days away.\n\nMaxwell was a confidante and ex-girlfriend of Epstein, who died in jail of an apparent suicide in August 2019 while awaiting trial for federal sex trafficking charges, according to The New York Times. She got arrested in early July on charges of allegedly helping Epstein recruit minors to sexually abuse and recently pleaded not guilty, USA Today reported.\n\n\u201cThe BBC ran this story for a few seconds last night. Luckily people managed to screenshot it,\u201d the Facebook post\u2019s caption claims. \u201cIt is dated 11th July 2020 and was removed within seconds of mistakenly being posted. It concerns Epstein\u2019s ex-gf Ghislaine Maxwell catching Covid-19 and presumably dying \u2013 disappearing so she doesn\u2019t have to face trial for sex offences.\u201d\n\nIn reality, BBC News hasn\u2019t reported that Maxwell was moved to intensive care for worsening COVID-19 symptoms nor that she contracted the disease. No story to either effect appears on the BBC News website, and the Daily Caller couldn\u2019t find any credible record of Maxwell testing positive for coronavirus online, as of press time.\n\nHad BBC News published such an article, it likely would not have been filed under the \u201cUK, England\u201d section, further adding to the post\u2019s dubiousness. Previous stories about Maxwell have appeared under the \u201cWorld, US & Canada\u201d section.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fake news article,\u201d Niamh McKenna, a publicist for BBC News, confirmed in an email to the Caller.

The real article, which had a similar headline, reported that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had entered intensive care during his battle with COVID-19. Johnson has since recovered.\n\nBrown Valley Observer, a self-described satire website, published on July 3 a parody news article about Maxwell testing positive for COVID-19.", "lang": "en"}
