Trump claimed the former intelligence director said, \u201cTrump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign,\u201d when, in fact, Clapper said the FBI did not spy on his campaign.\n\nClapper said that Trump should have been happy to know that the FBI was investigating \u201cwhat the Russians were doing\u201d to infiltrate his campaign and influence a U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe president in recent days has repeatedly accused the FBI of spying on his campaign in the summer of 2016. He\u2019s referring to media reports that an undercover FBI intelligence source met with Trump campaign aides in the summer and fall of 2016 as part of the agency\u2019s counterintelligence investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in the presidential campaign.\n\nIn a tweet on May 20, Trump called for the Justice Department to \u201clook into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes \u2013 and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!\u201d A day later, the Justice Department announced it asked the department\u2019s inspector general to conduct a review.\n\nRod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general overseeing the Russia investigation, said that \u201cif anyone did infiltrate or surveil participants in a presidential campaign for inappropriate purposes, we need to know about it and take appropriate action.\u201d\n\nEven before the inspector general\u2019s office begins its work, however, the president has determined that the FBI was illegally spying on his campaign. In a series of tweets on the morning of May 23, Trump claimed the FBI informant \u201cwas only there to spy for political reasons,\u201d calling it \u201ca major spy scandal\u201d \u2014 which he dubbed \u201cspygate.\u201d\n\nHe also misquoted Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, who appeared on \u201cThe View\u201d on May 22 to talk about his new book, \u201cFacts and Fears: Hard Truths from a Life in Intelligence.\u201d The show\u2019s co-hosts, Joy Behar and Whoopi Goldberg, later asked Clapper about the FBI\u2019s use of an undercover informant.\n\nBehar specifically asked Clapper if the FBI was \u201cspying on the Trump campaign.\u201d He said it did not. Still, Trump distorted Clapper\u2019s answer, putting these words in the mouth of the former intelligence head: \u201cTrump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s choice of words is verbatim from a headline on Real Clear Politics \u2014 except that the website only put the words \u201chappy\u201d and \u201cspying\u201d in quotation marks.\n\nIn remarks to reporters later in the day, Trump said Clapper \u201csort of admitted that they had spies in the campaign, yesterday, inadvertently.\u201d\n\nThe exchange between Clapper and Behar shows that Clapper, in fact, never said that \u201cthe FBI was SPYING on his campaign.\u201d Quite the opposite.\n\nClapper, May 22: With the informant business, well, the point here is \u2014 Behar: Well, let me get to my questions. Clapper: \u2014 are the Russians, not spying on the campaign. But what are the Russians doing and in a sense, unfortunately, what they were trying to do is protect our political system and protect the campaign. Behar: \u2026 So, I ask you, was the FBI spying on Trump\u2019s campaign? Clapper: No, they were not. They were spying on, a term I don\u2019t particularly like, but on what the Russians were doing. Trying to understand were the Russians infiltrating, trying to gain access, trying to gain leverage and influence which is what they do. Behar: Well, why doesn\u2019t he like that? He should be happy. Clapper: Well, he should be.\n\nSo, contrary to what Trump claimed, Clapper said the informant\u2019s target was the Russians, not the Trump campaign.\n\nIn the course of its counterintelligence investigation, which is still ongoing, the U.S. intelligence community has found that Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201cordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election,\u201d according to a declassified intelligence report released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Jan. 6, 2017.\n\nAccording to the report, Russian intelligence services gained access to the Democratic National Committee computer network and released hacked material to WikiLeaks and other outlets \u201cto help President-elect Trump\u2019s election chances.\u201d It also used \u201cpaid social media users or \u2018trolls'\u201d to wage a social media campaign to influence U.S. voters.\n\nSo far, the special counsel\u2019s office has charged three Russian organizations and 13 Russian nationals with illegal campaign activities and conspiracy to defraud the United States. According to the Feb. 16 indictment, Russians used the names of U.S. citizens and companies to illegally buy political ads on social media and paid \u201creal U.S. persons to promote or disparage candidates.\u201d U.S. citizens did not knowingly participate in these illegal activities, Rosenstein said at the time.\n\nIn addition, the special counsel\u2019s office has indicted Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, and Rick Gates, Manafort\u2019s former business associate and a Trump campaign aide, on charges related to their work, conducted before the Trump campaign, for a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine. Gates pleaded guilty to conspiracy and making false statements to federal investigators, and is now cooperating with investigators.\n\nAlso, George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser for the Trump campaign, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with a professor who Papadopoulos \u201cunderstood to have substantial connections to Russian government officials.\u201d\n\nRetired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, also pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI. Flynn admitted he lied to FBI agents about two discussions he had with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, in December 2016 when Flynn was still a private citizen and before Trump took office.\n\nBoth Papadopoulos and Flynn are now cooperating with the special counsel\u2019s investigation. (For more about these and other key moments in the investigation, please see \u201cTimeline of Russia Investigation.\u201d)\n\nPapadopoulos was among three Trump campaign officials who were contacted by the FBI informant in the summer and fall of 2016, according to the Washington Post. The others were Trump campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis and foreign policy adviser Carter Page, the Post reported.\n\nThe FBI informant\u2019s contacts with Trump campaign officials will be the subject of the inspector general\u2019s report, so it remains unclear whether the agency acted properly or not. But it is clear that Clapper thinks the agency did exactly what it should have done, and the president distorts his words in claiming otherwise.", "lang": "en"}
