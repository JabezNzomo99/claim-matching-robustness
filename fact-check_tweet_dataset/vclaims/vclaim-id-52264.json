Tony Evers came under fire after it was revealed a staff member in his office secretly recorded a May 14, 2020 phone meeting between the governor and Republican legislative leaders.\n\nThe move incensed Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, who immediately called for the staffer\u2019s firing.\n\nOther lawmakers, including Republicans and at least one Democrat, echoed that demand.\n\nState Rep. Romaine Quinn, R-Barron, waded into the debate during the GOP\u2019s June 18, 2020 weekly radio address, accusing Evers of \"a complete disregard for civility, cooperation and a lack of leadership.\"\n\nQuinn went on to say: \"The governor has refused to identify or discipline the staff member who secretly taped the conversation.\"\n\nWhat we know\n\nThe call in question came one day after the state Supreme Court threw out Evers\u2019 safer-at-home order, forcing officials to regroup and discuss a new response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nEvers, Vos and Fitzgerald talked respectfully to one another, but disagreed on next steps and what was happening in the state, based on a tape of the call released to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel under an open records request.\n\nWhen asked for evidence to back up Quinn\u2019s claim, an aide pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to a June, 11 2020 Department of Health Services briefing, at which Evers was asked about the recording incident, and a Wisconsin Radio Network-WSAU article about the briefing headlined, \"Evers won't fire staffer who secretly recorded phone call.\"\n\nDuring the briefing, on the state\u2019s response to COVID-19, Evers fielded multiple questions about the controversy and claimed he didn\u2019t know the meeting was being recorded.\n\nThe governor\u2019s chief legal counsel, Ryan Nilsestuen, said staff consented to the recording in compliance with the state\u2019s one-party consent rule, but wouldn\u2019t identify who OK\u2019d it.\n\n\"A staffer wanted help taking notes, and that\u2019s why that staffer did that,\" Evers said. \"I will not discuss personnel issues in public, but needless to say, the practice has ended with this one time.\"\n\nSo Quinn is right that Evers won\u2019t identify the staff member. But what about the discipline?\n\nWisconsin Radio Network reported in its article that Evers said the staffer \"will not be fired.\"\n\nOne problem: Evers never said that in the call, according to a review of the call by PolitiFact Wisconsin.\n\nHe has only continued to reiterate that he won\u2019t talk about disciplinary matters, so it\u2019s unclear how -- or whether -- the staffer has been disciplined. But in a June 23, 2020 DHS briefing, Evers hinted action had been taken, saying:\n\n\"This is obviously a personnel issue, and discipline measures are being handled internally,\" he said.\n\nEvers\u2019 office did not respond to questions from PolitiFact Wisconsin.\n\nIn the weekly GOP radio address, Quinn said Evers \"has refused to identify or discipline the staff member who secretly taped the conversation.\"\n\nThe governor has so far been very clear that he won\u2019t identify the person. But he repeatedly refused to discuss any discipline in public. So, on that point, Quinn mischaracterized what Evers said and what is known about the situation.\n\nThat leaves us with a statement that\u2019s partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.", "lang": "en"}
