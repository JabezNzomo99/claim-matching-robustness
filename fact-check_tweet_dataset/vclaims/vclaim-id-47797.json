The graphic has been digitally manipulated.\n\nDuterte received widespread criticism when he warned in early April that people could be shot for violating coronavirus lockdown measures in the Philippines. Now, a viral Facebook post alleges the queen praised Duterte\u2019s efforts to curb the spread of the new coronavirus in an April 6 televised address.\n\n\u201cPres. Duterte is the kind of leader who knows that way, goes the way, and shows the way. Filipinos are very fortunate to have him,\u201d the post quotes the queen as saying. \u201cSeriously, he looked so overworked. He may not be perfect, but he truly loves his country. Philippines doesn\u2019t have the worst government. It actually has the worst citizens.\u201d\n\nThe queen did make a rare televised speech thanking health care workers and vowing the U.K. \u201cwill succeed\u201d in its efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic on April 5 \u2013 not April 6, as the post suggests. The transcript of the speech shows that the queen at no point mentioned Duterte or the Philippines, however.\n\nThrough a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered that the graphic being shared in misleading posts has been manipulated. Inquirer.net, a Philippine media website, published a graphic quoting part of the queen\u2019s speech on its Facebook page.
