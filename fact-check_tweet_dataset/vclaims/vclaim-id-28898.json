This meant that for every pound donated, the UK government would add another from its international development budget. The donations drive\n\nBut do the two stats hold up to scrutiny? We checked.\n\nis the death of a woman caused by any stage of pregnancy or by childbirth complications, up to six weeks after delivery.\n\nThe cause of death could be direct (such as excessive bleeding) or indirect (when pregnancy aggravates an existing condition such as kidney problems), but accidental deaths are excluded.\n\nTo get the maternal mortality rate, the average annual number of maternal deaths in a population is divided by the female population of reproductive age (typically those aged 15 to 49 years). This is\n\nis not the same as the more commonly used mortality\n\nthe number of maternal deaths in relation to the number of live births. The two measures should not be used interchangeably, Dr Doris Chou, a\n\nwith the department of reproductive health and research at the WHO, told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cThese are all statistical measures and if someone wants to compare then you need to compare MMRatio to MMRatio and MMRate to MMRate, collected in the same methodology,\u201d Chou said.\n\nThere were data series comparing the maternal mortality rate between some countries, but she hadn\u2019t come across a \u201cfull series\u201d that compared all countries.\n\nData on the maternal mortality ratio, on the other hand, is widely available.\n\nthe most recent statistics from UN Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group, Kenya is one of 21 countries with a very high ratio of maternal deaths.\n\nThe data covered 1990 to 2015 and showed Kenya had 510 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births. Nigeria and India accounted for 34% of all maternal deaths, with sub-Saharan Africa countries accounting for 20 of the 21 countries.\n\n\u201cSo it is not \u2018off the mark\u2019 for the charity to make such a claim,\u201d Chou said.\n\nlive births from 2007 to 2014. The WHO previously told Africa Check that this survey was not available when the UN group was modelling the estimates in 2015. If it had been, the agency\u2019s best estimate would have been much closer to Kenya\u2019s.\n\nAn update to the UN\u2019s estimates was due in the next few months, Chou said.\n\nDr Gershim Asiki, an associate research scientist at the\n\n, agreed. \u201cEven 360 [maternal deaths per 100,000] is bad enough to be among one of the highest in the world. I would not ignore such figures as claims, provided they quote the data source,\u201d Asiki told Africa Check.\n\nWe therefore rate this claim as mostly correct.\n\nThe source of this claim was \u201ca Unicef report from 2018 which is the most up-to-date statistics available at the moment\u201d, Penny Appeal told Africa Check.\n\nto data on Kenya by the\n\n- the number of kids who die before their fifth birthday - as 45.6 deaths per 1,000 live births.\n\nThere were 52 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2014, the most recent year for which the\n\nKenya\u2019s national statistics office told Africa Check that the next survey would be done in 2019 and 2020.\n\nThere are more recent estimates. The 2018 Levels & Trends in Child Mortality report,\n\nThe report is produced by the\n\n, which includes Unicef, the WHO, the\n\nThey estimated that Kenya\u2019s under five mortality was 45.6 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2017 - the figure used by the charity.\n\nwho studies child deaths, told Africa Check that not all births and deaths are recorded, so registration data isn\u2019t used to estimate this mortality rate. In 2018, for example, Kenya registered 73.6% of its births and just 38.9% of its deaths,\n\nin Baltimore, US. He was also a technical advisor for the UN report.\n\nInstead of registration data, he said, \u201cdata from national surveys that ask about births and deaths are used to estimate the mortality rate\u201d.\n\nBlack said although the actual rate was lower than the claim, it was \u201creasonable\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe reported value is 46 per 1000 live births which is slightly less than one in 20 which would be 50 per 1,000. For simplicity I think that one in 20 is a fair statement,\u201d Black told Africa Check.", "lang": "en"}
