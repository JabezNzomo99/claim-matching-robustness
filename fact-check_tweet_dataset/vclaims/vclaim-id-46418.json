The message has the particulars of that medical kit and describes the three stages of COVID-19. A link to \u2018Tata Health\u2019 is given in that message suggesting that these recommendations are issued by Tata Health. Let\u2019s check if Tata Health had issued any such recommendations.\n\nClaim: Details of COVID-19 Medical kit for home usage and the three stages of COVID-19 issued by Tata Health. Fact: \u2018Tata health\u2019 has clarified that the link in the message belongs to their company but the message was not issued by them. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen a twitter user has tagged Tata Health requesting it to confirm the authenticity of the message, Tata Health clarified that the message was not issued by them.\n\nIn another tweet, Tata Health issued a \u2018Disclaimer\u2019 that unverified information is being circulated with their website link, and clarified that Tata Health is not associated with those messages in any way.\n\nAlso, when searched for the stages of COVID-19 given in the message, it was found that no renowned institute or organization has made such a classification of stages mentioned in the message. But it was found that recently, scientists have described three distinct phases of COVID-19 disease progression in patients and they are as follows \u2013\n\u2022 Phase-1 (Infection phase): The virus multiplies inside the body and is likely to cause mild symptoms that may be confused with a common cold or flu.\n\u2022 Phase-2 (Pulmonary phase): The immune system becomes strongly affected by the infection, and leads to primarily respiratory symptoms such as persistent cough, shortness of breath, and low oxygen levels.\n\u2022 Phase-3 (Hyperinflammatory phase): It occurs when a hyperactivated immune system may cause injury to the heart, kidneys, and other organs.\n\nAlso, the viral message claims that inhaling steam, hot water gargling as the methods for recovery from COVID-19, but FACTLY has earlier debunked these claims and those articles can be read here and here.\n\nTo sum it up, message with details of Covid-19 Medical kit for home usage and the three stages of COVID-19 is falsely attributed to Tata Health.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
