As such, Reuters Fact Check has removed the \u201cfalse\u201d rating that was earlier applied to this content.\n\n\u201cThe People\u2019s Voice\u201d posted an article here on Facebook from Newspunch.com here that claimed Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi had displayed a \u201cmassive meltdown\u201d during a press conference on January 30, 2020. The post stated that she had a \u201cmassive meltdown\u201d, the headline described it as a \u201chuge meltdown\u201d. The article itself referred to a \u201cmassive meltdown\u201d and claimed she \u201csnapped\u201d in her answer to a question at the press conference and went on an \u201cinsane rant.\u201d \u200b\n\nThe article referred to Pelosi snapping in an answer about acquittal:\n\n\u201cA reporter asked Pelosi if Trump will be \u201cchastened\u201d knowing \u201cCongress is watching him\u201d or \u201cemboldened\u201d if the senate acquits him.\n\n\u201cWell he will NOT be acquitted. You cannot be acquitted if you don\u2019t have a trial and when you don\u2019t have a trial if you don\u2019t have witnesses and documentation,\u201d Pelosi snapped.\u201d\n\nIn the video of the press conference here in its entirety on C-SPAN) she responds to a question that includes the quote referred to in the article regarding her \u201csnapping\u201d, visible at 14:58: \u200b\n\n\u201cWell, he will not be acquitted. You cannot be acquitted if you don\u2019t have a trial and you don\u2019t have a trial if you don\u2019t have witnesses and documentation and that. I hope that the senators, if it comes to a tie or if there is a question of hearing testimony or receiving documents would leave it up to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Republican appointed in a republican majority court; I would think that they would have confidence in the Chief Justice of the United States. That\u2019s really his title. And that\u2019s interesting to me that they\u2019re afraid of breaking a tie with the Chief Justice of the United States. Does the president know right from wrong? I don\u2019t think so. That\u2019s all I can say.\u201d\n\nPelosi can be seen in video here of the conference calmly answering the question mentioned in this claim without raising her voice for the about 40-seconds. \u201cInsane rant\u201d would imply at the very least that she got agitated. In a literal sense it would mean she was not well mentally and spoke for a long time. \u201cMassive\u201d or \u201chuge\u201d meltdown would suggest that she would appear to be very upset or shaken up. The video shows she does not lose her composure and answers in a steady and calm way. Overall, Pelosi can be seen answering questions calmly and smiling occasionally during the press conference shown in the video and mentioned in this claim. \u200bAt no point, during the entire interview here does Pelosi lose her composure.\n\nThe claim that Nancy Pelosi had a \u201chuge\u201d or \u201cmassive\u201d breakdown or went on an insane rant is in this case false. Based on video of the conference, Nancy Pelosi did say \u201che will not be acquitted\u201d in reference to President Trump, video of the conference shows her answer is far from a \u201chuge\u201d or \u201cmassive\u201d meltdown.\n\nFalse: Nancy Pelosi did not have a \u201cmassive\u201d or \u201chuge\u201d meltdown at a press conference", "lang": "en"}
