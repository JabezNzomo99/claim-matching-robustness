The various iterations of the claim misleadingly refer to two unrelated fires at plants in Illinois and in Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Mexico. The factories referenced in the claim do not produce magnesium stearate.\n\nAs of May 15, 2020 multiple iterations of the claim have been shared over 11,439 times on Facebook. Posts are visible here , here , here and here .\n\nOne post reads: \u201cTWO separate plants were mysteriously blown up - one in Mexico and one in Illinois. Major supplier of Magnesium Stearate to U.S. blown up in Mexico, at a CHINESE-owned port. Both - just so happen to manufacture Magnesium Stearate- the key component in (SIC) Hydroxychloroquinone and in Zithromax.\u201d\n\nMagnesium stearate is a component in hydroxychloroquine and Zithromax \u2013 true\n\nMagnesium stearate is a chemical compound in the form of a fine white powder ( here ) commonly used in medical tablets and capsules, as a lubricant agent that prevents the active ingredients from sticking during manufacture ( here , here ).\n\nIt is true it magnesium stearate is found as an inactive ingredient in hydroxychloroquine ( here ) and zithromax (azithromycin) ( here ).\n\nHydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug championed by President Donald Trump in April as a potential treatment for COVID-19 ( here ).\n\nA plant that produces magnesium stearate was blown up in Mexico \u2013 false\n\nThe claim references a fire that happened on the night of May 6, 2020 in the north of Mexico in Garc\u00eda, Nuevo Le\u00f3n. A video of the incident and local media reports are visible here , here and here .\n\nServicios Ambientales Carriaga ( here ) confirmed to Reuters its factory does not produce magnesium stearate. A spokesperson told Reuters that the company is dedicated to waste management and recycling.\n\nMost of the iterations of the claim link to a RT report visible here . The report does not say that the factory produces magnesium stearate.\n\nSome iterations of the claim (visible here and here ) also misleadingly refer to Corporaci\u00f3n Sierra Madre as the company hit by the fire. This is a different organization that does produce magnesium stereate ( here ). It is located 12 miles (20 km) from Servicios Ambientales Carriaga ( bit.ly/2zDjQwG ).\n\nA plant in Madison, Illinois, that produces magnesium stearate was blown up \u2013 false\n\nSome claims reference a recent fire affecting the Magnesium Elektron plant in Madison, Illinois, that happened on May 7, 2020 ( here , here ).\n\nWhile the Magnesium Elektron plant does manufacture magnesium products, it does not produce magnesium stearate. According to the company, the main product of the Magnesium Elektron plant in Madison, Illinois is magnesium sheets, not magnesium stearate (see page 22 here ). A corporate video of the factory is visible here ).\n\n\u201cMagnesium Elektron North America (MENA) has three sites that also supply magnesium sheet and coil for commercial, aerospace and defense applications,\u201d states the company in a corporate brochure (see page 13 bit.ly/2WEQ03L )\n\nA company spokesperson confirmed to Reuters via email that the \u201cthe factory in Madison, IL does not produce Magnesium Stearate.\u201d\n\nThe two fire incidents did happen a day apart, but the plants in these fires do not produce magnesium stearate for hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.\n\nThe claim comes amidst the worldwide search for a COVID-19 treatment and vaccine. Demand for hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug, surged after Trump touted it as a potential treatment for the novel coronavirus in early April. U.S. regulators have since authorized its emergency use for COVID-19 patients ( here ).\n\nWhile the drug has not been proven effective against the disease ( here , here ), it is being widely studied in the U.S. and abroad as a potential COVID-19 treatment ( here ).\n\nFalse. These two unrelated fires did not affect plants that produce magnesium stearate.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
