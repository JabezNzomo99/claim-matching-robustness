Vons has acknowledged that the incident took place at one of their stores.\n\nIt is not yet known whether the customer did in fact eventually remove the hood and/or check out with his groceries. The San Diego County Sheriff\u2019s Department said that deputies were not called to the scene, but they are reviewing security video footage to identify the person seen in the pictures and may pursue criminal charges against him.\n\nCNN spoke to some customers who were in the Santee Vons store at the time:\n\nCustomer Alisa Wentzel told CNN she spotted the shopper, whom she believes was a man, as soon as she entered the store. He was waiting in the checkout line, she said, wearing the hood. At first she didn\u2019t believe what she was seeing, she told CNN. Wentzel moved between aisles to sneak photos of him and keep her distance. \u201cManagement should be doing something, but I didn\u2019t see anyone talking to him,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was just standing in line.\u201d By the time she\u2019d finished her shopping at the self-checkout lane some 30 minutes later, the man was in line waiting for a cashier, still wearing his hood, she said. \u201cI just remember feeling so heartbroken, so hopeless and then also just really upset that this would happen in the community that I raise my family in,\u201d she said. \u201cI was just in utter shock and disbelief. I still feel that way.\u201d\n\nSan Diego television station KGTV reported that the full statement from Vons on the matter read as follows:\n\nAt Vons, fostering an environment of courtesy, dignity, and respect is one of our highest priorities, and we work hard to hold everyone in our stores to these standards, including customers. Unfortunately, an alarming and isolated incident occurred at our Vons store in Santee, where a customer chose an inflammatory method of wearing a face covering. Needless to say, it was shocking. Several members of our team asked the customer to remove it, and all requests were ignored until the customer was in the checkout area. This was a disturbing incident for our associates and customers, and we are reviewing with our team how to best handle such inappropriate situations in the future.", "lang": "en"}
