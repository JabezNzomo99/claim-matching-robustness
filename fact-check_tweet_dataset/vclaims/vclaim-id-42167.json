These are CCTV videos, and are claimed to be of the Pulwama terror attack.\n\nThe first video is grainy, and shows a convoy of vehicles in the distance, before a huge explosion takes place.\n\nThe above video, posted by a Facebook page with close to 300,000 followers, has been shared almost 600 times and viewed over 22,000 times.
