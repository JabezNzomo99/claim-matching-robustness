This scheme is called 'Pradhanmantri Kaniya Ashirwaad Yojana.'\n\nGovernment of India under the newly launched 'PM Kalyan Aashirvad Yojana' is distributing \u20b9 2000 to every girl child in the country. Usually, all the schemes launched by the Central government related to the welfare of women and child are listed on the website of the Ministry of Women and Child Development. However, the 'PM Kalyan Aashirvad Yojana' is not listed on the ministry website.\n\nOn searching 'Pradhanmantri Kaniya Ashirwaad Yojana' in the Government of India web directory, no results came up.
