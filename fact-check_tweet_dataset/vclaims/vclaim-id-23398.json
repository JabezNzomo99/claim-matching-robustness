Cocaine use is almost certainly growing in certain cities and, thanks to new research into wastewater, we know much more about how much cocaine people are taking than we used to.\n\nThe reports are based on a European research study into drugs and wastewater. Scientists from major cities across Europe have been testing samples of wastewater from sewage plants, to measure how much of different substances are in people\u2019s urine. They apply these findings to the population served by the sewage works, to come up with the average consumption of different substances per person.\n\nFor London and Bristol\u2014the two UK cities in the study\u2014they\u2019ve found that concentrations of cocaine have been increasing for the past 5-7 years. In London, for example, they estimated just under 400mg per 1,000 people per day, in 2011. By 2016, that was up to nearly 900mg. That\u2019s what the news reports mean by a \u201cdoubling\u201d of cocaine use.\n\nWe don\u2019t know enough detail about the methodology behind the claim that \u201cone in 50 Londoners\u201d are snorting cocaine to assess its accuracy.\n\nSo does this mean more people are using cocaine?\n\nOn the surface, it\u2019s likely that this data reflects some increase in the number of people using cocaine on a daily basis in the cities concerned. But we need to be cautious about concluding that usage in these places or across Britain has \u201cdoubled\u201d or that \u201cone in 50 Londoners\u201d are snorting cocaine.\n\nFirst of all, these findings don\u2019t tell us about the number of people using drugs, they just give us a sense of the total amount going into sewage.\n\nHarry Sumnall, Professor in Substance Use at Liverpool John Moores University, told us:\n\n\u201cThe technique is unable to provide estimates on prevalence and frequency of drug use, or provide insights into who is taking drugs, the purity of those drugs, or patterns of use \u2013 you still need surveys and other types of data to assist with this.\n\n\u201cThe total amount of drugs used across a population is not uniformly distributed. Most people in a city will have never used an illicit drug, and amongst those who have, most of the total amount will be consumed by a smaller subset. Hence it\u2019s not possible to infer that detection of a certain amount of drug in wastewater represents use by a specific proportion of people in the analysed area.\u201d\n\nSecondly, London and Bristol are not the whole of Britain. They\u2019re two cities in the south of England, and we\u2019ve no way of knowing how well their findings would reflect usage in towns or other cities or more rural parts of Britain. The European researchers make clear that drawing assumptions about an entire country from a limited number of plants and locations is unreliable.\n\nIt\u2019s also not clear whether the findings cover the whole populations of the cities or just those served by the same sewage works.\n\nThe news articles reporting on this study mentioned the locations involved in the study, but this point didn\u2019t make it into any of the headlines.\n\nOther evidence does suggest the quantity and purity of cocaine have been rising in recent years. Seizures of cocaine by police and the Border Force rose in the years up to 2016/17, although that\u2019s been followed by a fall in 2017/18. The National Crime Agency also reports that the purity levels of cocaine it is monitoring are at historically high levels.\n\nSurvey evidence suggests cocaine use is growing, but it has big limitations\n\nThe \u2018traditional\u2019 method of estimating how many people use cocaine is to ask people in a confidential survey. In England and Wales, the household-based Crime Survey fills that role.\n\nThe survey tells us that about 2-3% of adults aged 16-59 say they have used powdered cocaine in the past year, and that\u2019s been broadly stable since the early 2000s. There\u2019s been a slight uptick in the reported rate in the last year we have figures for\u20142017/18.\n\nThe picture is clearer among 16-24 year-olds specifically. In 2017/18, an estimated 6% reported using powdered cocaine, which has been on an upward trend in the last five years.\n\nVery few people report using crack cocaine, by comparison.\n\nThere are also figures for London specifically\u2014which actually broadly show falls in the proportion of people reporting cocaine use over the last five years.\n\nBut we can\u2019t entirely rely on these figures. The obvious point is that people may not be completely honest about doing something illegal, even if the survey is confidential.\n\nAnd there are also problems in who the survey is asking. As Professor Sumnall puts it:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a household survey and tends to underrepresent some groups of people more likely to use drugs, relies on people reporting behaviour they know is against the law, and with newer drugs, people often don\u2019t know exactly what they\u2019ve taken.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re waiting to hear from the original authors of these claims\n\nThere\u2019s only so much we can say at the moment about the claim that cocaine use has doubled. Several of the figures used in the reports seem to originate from disclosures to the Telegraph from a researcher at King\u2019s College London (KCL), which is one of the universities involved in gathering data for the UK as part of the European study.\n\nWe contacted KCL to find out more about where these claims come from, and to ask for more information about their role in the study. We were told that no one was available to speak to this week. KCL also haven\u2019t published any information on their study to back up the coverage in the Telegraph.\n\nThis is unsatisfactory. Claims like these which are published by a national newspaper should be checkable, and that means both that the original source should be made available and that there should be a contactable point person, especially in the days following a news splash. Neither was the case here.", "lang": "en"}
