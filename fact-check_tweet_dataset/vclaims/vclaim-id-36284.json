Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: 99% of the Muslim voters and 68% of the Hindu voters have voted in the 2020 Delhi Elections. Fact: The Election Commission of India does not provide information regarding voter turnout on the basis of religion. While it is true that some of the Muslim majority constituencies have recorded higher voter turnouts, it does not mean that 99% of all the Muslim voters have cast their votes. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nThe Election Commission of India provides information regarding the voter turnout of all the elections on the \u2018Voter Turnout\u2019 application. The total number of voters in NCT of Delhi are 1,46,92,136. Delhi witnessed 62.59% voter turnout, so the number of voters who voted on the poll day was around 92 lakhs. In the \u2018Voter Turnout\u2019 application, it can be seen that there is no information on the voter turnout based on the religion. The voter turnout is provided only for the constituency, district, and total. ECI does not release voter turnout data on the basis of religion.\n\nSome of the Muslim majority constituencies have recorded higher voter turnouts in the Delhi Elections. It does not mean that 99% of all Muslim voters have cast their votes. There is no data to suggest that 99% of Muslim voters voted. There are some exit polls that suggested that the majority of Muslims might vote for AAP (69% Muslim voters) and Congress (15% Muslim voters). But, they do not claim that 99% of the Muslim voters have come out on the Election day to vote.\n\nTo sum it up, some false random figures have been posted on social media to claim that 99% of the Muslim voters and 68% of the Hindu voters have voted in Delhi Elections.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
