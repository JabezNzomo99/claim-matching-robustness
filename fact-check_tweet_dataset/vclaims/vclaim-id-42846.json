The image has been captioned as, \"Have heard, drunk people are honest. But the drunk man you see in the photo is a liar. He is state's chief secretary Rajiva Sinha. He has given out false information regarding Corona and put the entire state in danger. Now he is sipping alcohol and enjoying it.\" (Original text in Bengali: \"\u09b6\u09c1\u09a8\u09c7\u099b\u09bf \u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09be\u09b2\u09b0\u09be \u09a8\u09be\u0995\u09bf \u09b8\u09a4\u09cd\u09af\u09ac\u09be\u09a6\u09c0 \u09b9\u09af\u09bc,\u0995\u09bf\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u09c1 \u0986\u09aa\u09a8\u09be\u09b0\u09be \u099b\u09ac\u09bf\u09a4\u09c7 \u09af\u09c7\u0987 , \u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09be\u09b2\u099f\u09be\u0995\u09c7 \u09a6\u09c7\u0996\u09a4\u09c7 \u09aa\u09be\u099a\u09cd\u099b\u09c7\u09a8 \u098f \u09aa\u09c1\u09b0 \u09ae\u09bf\u09a5\u09cd\u09af\u09c7\u09ac\u09be\u09a6\u09c0. \u09b0\u09be\u099c\u09cd\u09af\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ae\u09c1\u0996\u09cd\u09af \u09b8\u099a\u09bf\u09ac \u09b0\u09be\u099c\u09bf\u09ac \u09b8\u09bf\u09a8\u09b9\u09be \u0995\u09b0\u09cb\u09a8\u09be\u09df \u09ae\u09bf\u09a5\u09cd\u09af\u09c7 , \u09a4\u09a5\u09cd\u09af \u09a6\u09bf\u09af\u09bc\u09c7 \u0997\u09cb\u099f\u09be \u09b0\u09be\u099c\u09cd\u09af\u0995\u09c7 \u09ac\u09bf\u09aa\u09a6\u09c7 \u09ab\u09c7\u09b2\u09c7 \u09a6\u09bf\u09af\u09bc\u09c7, \u09ae\u09a6\u09c7\u09b0 \u0997\u09cd\u09b2\u09be\u09b8\u09c7 \u099a\u09c1\u09ae\u09c1\u0995 \u09a6\u09bf\u09a4\u09c7 \u09a6\u09bf\u09a4\u09c7 \u09ae\u099c\u09be \u09a8\u09bf\u099a\u09cd\u099b\u09c7. #FaliureRajibSinha #IndiaFightsCorona (\u09b8\u0982\u0997\u09c3\u09b9\u09c0\u09a4)\"\n\nClick here to view the archive of the post and see the viral Facebook post below.\n\nThe Inter Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) had earlier sent a letter to the state government of West Bengal questioning the mismatch in data related to COVID-19. Sinha, who was appointed as the chief secretary of Bengal in 2019, clarified that there were \"gaps in the data that triggered confusion.\" In a press conference on May 4, Sinha further said that it was not deliberate and the discrepancies have been rectified.\n\nBOOM was able to ascertain that the photograph is an old one and not related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Upon reverse searching the image, we came across Rajiva Sinha's Facebook profile. The same image was posted by the user in July, 2013, with the caption, \"A quiter evening at Patna.\"\n\nBOOM could not independently verify Rajiva Sinha's Facebook profile.
