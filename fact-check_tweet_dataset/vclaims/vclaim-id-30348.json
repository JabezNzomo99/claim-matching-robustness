While social care came top in the poll, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the issue the British public think the government should prioritise above all others.\n\nThe survey of UK adults was conducted by research agency Opinium on behalf of think tank Bright Blue.\n\nRespondents were asked, among other things, what level of priority they thought the government should place on social care. 32% said the government should make social care a \u201cvery high priority\u201d and another 41% said it should be a \u201chigh priority\u201d.\n\nThat combined score of 73% was higher than any of other issues asked about, which were: climate change, air pollution, human rights violations abroad, race and gender discrimination, integration of immigrants, childcare, universal credit and pension reform.\n\nNow, whatever your view on the importance of these issues, this clearly isn\u2019t a comprehensive list of the issues the government may face.\n\nSo while social care is undoubtedly seen as an important issue by the survey\u2019s respondents, we can\u2019t say that the public thinks the government should prioritise it above all other issues.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s a slightly different question, another pollster, Ipsos MORI, asks the British public on a monthly basis what they think are the biggest issues facing the country.\n\nIn the latest round in November 2019, the public overwhelmingly identified Brexit as the most important issue facing Britain today.\n\nThis question also differs from the one asked by Opinium because it does not prompt respondents with answer options. People can answer freely.\n\nWhen respondents were asked to name \u201cimportant issues\u201d as opposed to just the \u201cmain issue\u201d facing the country, 57% of the public said Brexit and 54% said the NHS.\n\nSocial care for the elderly and the \u201caging population\u201d was mentioned by 10% of people, below a range of other issues including education, the economy, crime, poverty and housing.", "lang": "en"}
