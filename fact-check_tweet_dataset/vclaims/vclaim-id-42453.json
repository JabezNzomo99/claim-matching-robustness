Some of the falsehoods, such as conspiracy theories about the virus\u2019 spread, are quite elaborate.\n\nA more recent Facebook post is not one of those claims.\n\nIn a March 19 post, a Facebook user said the coronavirus doesn\u2019t actually exist.\n\n\"There is no virus,\" the user wrote in all capital letters. \"The government is trying to enforce martial law and place a chip inside of us as a \u2018vaccine.\u2019\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It had more than 8,000 shares as of March 19.\n\nThe post is bogus \u2014 it\u2019s similar to a conspiracy theory that falsely claims the media and politicians have fabricated the threat of COVID-19. There is ample evidence that the coronavirus is real and infecting hundreds of thousands of people around the world.\n\nScientists have traced the first confirmed case of COVID-19 to Hubei Province, China, in November. Several news outlets covered the subsequent outbreak in the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nFrom there, the coronavirus spread to more than 100 countries around the world. As of March 19, more than 191,000 people had been infected and 7,807 had been killed by the virus, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nFootage from a variety of news outlets has documented the spread of COVID-19. Scientists have isolated the genetic data and approximate origin of the virus, as well as how different groups of people are affected. They\u2019ve also released microscopic images of coronavirus virions.\n\nRELATED: 7 ways to avoid misinformation during the coronavirus pandemic\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 is a betacoronavirus like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). All three have their origins in bats and cause symptoms like cough, shortness of breath and fever. COVID-19 is a \"novel,\" or new, coronavirus, meaning it had not been previously identified.\n\nThe WHO has declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a pandemic and global health emergency. On the advice of health officials, several countries \u2014 including France, Italy and Spain \u2014 have ordered nationwide lockdowns to prevent the spread of the virus. Coronavirus prevention measures have caused the plunge of global financial markets, as well as layoffs across the country.\n\nTo claim that the virus at the center of the pandemic does not exist, as the Facebook post does, is inaccurate and ridiculous.
