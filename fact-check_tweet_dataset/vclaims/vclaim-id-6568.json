Different measures may well show different results.\n\nHigh-achieving well-off pupils in Scotland perform better at science, reading and maths than high-achieving poor pupils, according to the research.\n\nIt analysed data from 2015 from the PISA international survey of 15 year olds\u2019 educational performance. The survey specifically seeks to test children\u2019s \u201cfunctional ability\u201d, so how well they can use their science, maths, and reading skills in \u201creal life\u201d situations.\n\nThe gap in test scores between the two groups was translated as 31 months for science and maths, and 26 months for reading.\n\nSo poorer pupils were somewhere between two and three years \u2018behind\u2019 their better-off peers, according to the research. That\u2019s actually a slightly smaller gap than is the case in England and compared to the average of the mainly wealthy countries covered by the PISA figures.\n\nThere are many variables in play to produce this kind of estimate. You need to choose who counts as rich and who counts as poor. You need to choose who counts as a high-achiever. You need to be happy that the test scores are an accurate reflection of ability. And you need to assume, based on those test scores, how far \u2018behind\u2019 one pupil is from another.\n\nFor instance, the measure of deprivation used in this report isn\u2019t the same measure that\u2019s commonly used in Scotland. It compares the 25% most deprived pupils with the 25% least deprived, based on ranking them by their background via a questionnaire. The measure used in Scotland identifies small geographic areas of deprivation based on a range of different factors like health and people\u2019s incomes.\n\nAnother assumption is that a difference of about 30 points on PISA tests is equivalent to about a year\u2019s attainment. That\u2019s how we get from test scores to a claim about how far behind some children are to others. This isn\u2019t a precise science, and previous years\u2019 surveys actually said 40 points was equivalent to a year.\n\nA final note of caution is with PISA figures themselves. They\u2019re based on a sample of 15 year olds, so there\u2019s some uncertainty in the figures. They also don\u2019t tell us why some countries, schools or pupils perform better than others.\n\nNone of this is to say the headline claim is a bad estimate, especially if you agree with the choices the research has made on these questions. But it\u2019s because of this uncertainty that we can\u2019t say the findings are definitive.", "lang": "en"}
