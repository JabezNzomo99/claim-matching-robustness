In fact, it depicted an area completely on the opposite side of the U.S. from Seattle.\n\nAs noted on the Greenpointers neighborhood blog, this picture was taken in Greenpoint, a neighborhood in northern Brooklyn, New York, and it recorded the aftermath of a trash fire:\n\n[M]any social media posts have repackaged the likely aftermath of a trash fire on the corner of West and Huron Streets in Greenpoint as a scene from Seattle\u2019s protests. Manny Lorras, a tenant in the building complex near the corner of West and Huron Streets, confirmed that the image is \u201c1000%\u201d of the building on that corner. He also thinks it \u201chas to be\u201d the trash fire that occurred on that street on June 2 of this year. \u201cWhen the fire department came \u2026 the hose pressure blew out the window,\u201d he explained, having received much of his information about the fire from one of the doorman in his building complex. Building management boarded up the broken window that day, Lorras says. Whoever took the photograph must have snapped it soon after the fire department came, according to Lorras\u2019s version of events. (A window in the image is shattered.)\n\nA short video of the scene viewable on Instagram notes that the appearance of the area \u201cwas caused by a lit cigarette tossed from an apartment, erupting the pile of trash bags in flames,\u201d and was \u201cnot related to demonstrations\u201d:", "lang": "en"}
