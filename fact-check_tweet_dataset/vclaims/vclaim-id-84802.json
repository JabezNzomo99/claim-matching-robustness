It is political correctness. We didn\u2019t monitor the Facebook posting of the female San Bernardino terrorist because the Obama DHS thought it would be inappropriate. She made a public call to jihad, and they didn\u2019t target it.\u201d\n\nCruz said in several radio and television interviews in the days following the Brussels attacks that the Obama administration had failed to monitor the public call to jihad on social media by one of the two killers in the Dec. 2, 2015, mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. The couple died in a shootout with police.\n\nOn Dec. 2, 2015, Malik published a Facebook post under an assumed name on behalf of the couple just as the attacks started. The post read, \u201cWe pledge allegiance\u201d to Khalifah Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Al Qurashi, the leader of the Islamic State. Facebook confirmed the account belonging to Malik and took down the profile page and post the day after the shooting.\n\nThe New York Times had reported on Dec. 13, 2015, that Malik \u201ctalked openly about jihad on social media before she applied for a visa to come to the United States.\u201d This revelation drew swift criticism from Congress and presidential candidates. But that claim turned out to be inaccurate, as an editors\u2019 note now describes at the end of the article.\n\nOn Dec. 16, 2015, Comey called such reports \u201ca garble,\u201d saying that the calls to jihad were made in private messages and email communications that were not easily accessible to federal law enforcement. In such private communications, the couple expressed their joint commitment to jihad and to martyrdom, Comey said.\n\n\u201cSo far in this investigation, we have found no evidence of posting on social media by either of them, at that period of time and thereafter, reflecting their commitment to jihad or to martyrdom,\u201d Comey said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t intercept the communications of Americans\u2026without predication, without probable cause or belief that they are involved in terrorism or serious criminal activity,\u201d Comey continued. \u201cIf we don\u2019t know anything about somebody we are not combing through their emails or direct messages.\u201d\n\nMalik had passed background checks during her fiancee visa application process, which did not flag her extremist views. But even if immigration officials had culled her public social media activity, they likely would not have come across private emails and messages between the couple about their commitment to jihad or martyrdom.\n\nCruz first began making this claim in the days following the attack, saying the female San Bernardino shooter had publicly declared a call for jihad on Facebook, which the Obama Administration refused to investigate out of political correctness. Whether the decision by the administration not to review public social media postings for visas was out of \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d is a matter of opinion, and can\u2019t be fact-checked. But even if Malik\u2019s public social media activity were vetted, it would not have surfaced private messages and emails between Malik and Farook about jihad and martyrdom. Plus, Malik used Facebook under an assumed name, further making it more difficult to track her social media activities.\n\nTwo weeks after the shooting, the FBI director clarified that there were no calls to jihad and martyrdom in publicly posted social media messages by Malik. It has been more than three months since then, and Cruz really has no excuse to continue repeating this falsehood unless he has some exclusive insight into the FBI\u2019s investigation that has not been shared publicly. Malik did publish a post on Facebook on behalf of herself and her husband, pledging allegiance to the Islamic State leader \u2013 but this post was published just after the mass shooting began.", "lang": "en"}
