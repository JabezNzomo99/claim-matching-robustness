It\u2019s attributed to Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and ends with an uncharacteristic scolding.\n\n\"For those in our society who suggest that people being cautious are cowards, for people who refuse to take even the simplest of precautions to protect themselves and those around them, I want to ask, without hyperbole and in all sincerity: How dare you?\" the statement says. It goes on to encourage doing everything we can to mitigate the risk of exposure to the coronavirus, to flatten the curve and avoid unnecessary suffering and death.\n\n\"I reject the notion that it\u2019s \u2018just a virus\u2019 and we\u2019ll all get it eventually,\" the post concludes. \"What a careless, lazy heartless stance.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The words themselves are an opinion and not something we at PolitiFact fact-check.\n\nBut the attribution to Fauci is wrong and worth correcting. In a statement, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told PolitiFact that Fauci wasn\u2019t the author of the post.\n\nIn the comments of another Facebook post with virtually the same words published July 14 \u2014 several days before the one we\u2019re fact-checking \u2014 a user named Amy Wright takes credit for the statement.\n\n\"I just saw your words credited to Dr. Fauci,\" another user wrote. \"How about that! People are still sharing your post and learning. Thank you.\"\n\n\"Oh dear,\" Wright replied. The internet is like the wild west sometimes, isn\u2019t it? At least no one attributed it to Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\nWe rate the claim that Fauci wrote this Facebook post False.", "lang": "en"}
