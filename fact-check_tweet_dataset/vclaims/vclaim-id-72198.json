She was married.\" He also uses graphic terms to describe the woman\u2019s body and says he frequently tries to kiss beautiful women and even grab their genitals.\n\nRyan denounced Trump and said Trump would not be attending the rally.\n\nThree days after the video\u2019s release, on Oct. 10, 2016, Ryan went further, declaring to fellow Republican House members he would not defend Trump, and instead focus on maintaining the GOP\u2019s majority in the House.\n\nSo, we wondered about a tweet issued the same day by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nShe claimed: \"Ryan is still endorsing Trump.\"\n\nRyan\u2019s dilemma on supporting Trump was evident in May 2016, when we tested him on our Flip-O-Meter, which is used to see whether a politician has changed positions. We gave Ryan a Half Flip.\n\nAt the time, just after Trump became the presumptive GOP nominee with a win in Indiana\u2019s primary, Ryan had said repeatedly he would support for president whomever won the Republican nomination. He said so even when asked specifically about Trump.\n\nYet in his first comments after Trump won in Indiana, Ryan wavered. He did not say he would not support Trump. But he stated he was not ready to support him at that time.\n\nThen in June 2016, a month before Trump won the nomination, Ryan endorsed him, saying:\n\n\"It's no secret that he and I have our differences. I won't pretend otherwise. And when I feel the need to, I'll continue to speak my mind. But the reality is, on the issues that make up our agenda, we have more common ground than disagreement.\"\n\nEarly on Oct. 10, 2016, Politico reported that, according to sources, Ryan was discussing whether to revoke his Trump endorsement. Clinton sent her tweet several hours later, after Ryan held a private conference call with House Republicans that was later discussed publicly.\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign cited to us a same-day blog post from the Los Angeles Times about the call. The post was headlined: \"House Speaker Paul Ryan will not campaign with Trump, but still endorses him.\"\n\nOther news accounts on the conference call were similar.\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel stated Ryan \"stopped short of rescinding his own tepid endorsement of Trump,\" and quoted a Ryan aide as saying there is \"no update\" in his position on Trump \"at this time.\"\n\nThe New York Times and ABC News said Ryan responded to criticism for not supporting Trump more by emphasizing that he wasn't withdrawing his endorsement.\n\nAs for Ryan himself, when we asked his campaign about Clinton\u2019s claim, a spokesman simply reiterated what had been put out earlier, saying: \"There is no update in his position at this time.\"\n\nClinton says Ryan \"is still endorsing Trump.\"\n\nAs of the time when Clinton made the claim, Ryan\u2019s endorsement of Trump for president remained in place.", "lang": "en"}
