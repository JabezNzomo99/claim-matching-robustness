Donald Trump approved that I be killed, that I be killed,\u201d Maduro said. \u201cThey are trying to move a group of snipers or to buy some snipers in Venezuela to kill me. Donald Trump decided and activated it.\u201d\n\nIn March, the Trump administration indicted Maduro, as well as 14 of his top officials, on drug trafficking charges. A $15 million reward was offered for any information leading to the Venezuelan president\u2019s arrest or conviction, along with a $10 million reward for information on his inner circle members.\n\nAs Bloomberg reported, the U.S. alleged that Maduro\u2019s government gave the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the rebel group known as FARC, authority to fly planes with drugs over Venezuelan airspace and to manufacture cocaine.\n\nThe charges carry a minimum sentence of 50 years and a maximum of life in prison. However, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan acknowledged that authorities couldn\u2019t arrest Maduro in Venezuela.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a conspiracy from the U.S. and Colombia and they\u2019ve given the order of filling Venezuela with violence,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cAs Head of State I am obliged to defend the Peace and stability for all the Motherland, under any circumstance that comes our way. They could not and will not!\u201d\n\nAlthough Maduro now says otherwise, the $15 million U.S. bounty is for information leading to his arrest or conviction, not his assassination.\n\nAfter Maduro was re-elected in 2018, the opposition rejected the results. In January 2019, Juan Guaido, as leader of the National Assembly, declared himself Venezuela\u2019s legitimate president. He quickly received support from the United States and its allies.\n\nAs the Washington Post reported, for most of 2019, Trump administration officials emphasized they wanted Maduro to leave the country for exile and pledged not to pursue him. According to the Post, a senior official said last year the effort \u201cis not about revenge\u201d and that the U.S. \"would be happy to pay the airfare.\u201d\n\nEfforts to obtain White House and State Department comment for this fact check were unsuccessful.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Maduro has said opponents want him killed. In August 2018, as he addressed a military parade in Caracas, two small drones flying over the event exploded \u2013 an event the government claimed was a targeted assassination attempt. Maduro blamed the opposition and Colombian government, but both denied involvement, CNN reported.\n\nMany have questioned the government\u2019s accounts, saying the incident was a false flag operation staged by Maduro\u2019s government to justify the repression of the opposition. Arrests followed, and, as Bloomberg reported, Venezuela has a history of using supposed anti-government plots to pursue dissidents.\n\nThe alleged drone attack gave \u201csome credibility to his conspiracy theories,\u201d Peruvian writer Mirko Lauer said in the newspaper La Republica.\n\nIn July, Maduro accused Colombian President Ivan Duque of planning his assassination. \"Iv\u00e1n Duque is training some snipers [in Colombia] to kill me,\" he said on TV, adding that, despite the threats, he would continue attending public events, the Spanish news agency Agencia EFE reported.\n\nIn May, a group of self-declared \u201cfreedom fighters\u201d was captured in Venezuela in a failed attempt to overthrow Maduro. Luke Denman, a U.S. citizen and former Green Beret, was one of those captured. Another former Green Beret, Jordan Goudreau, who operated Silvercorp USA, a Florida-based private security firm, claimed responsibility for the operation.\n\nBoth the Pentagon and Trump denied involvement in the incident. Polygraph.info fact-checked Denman's claim that Trump ordered Goudreau to launch the attack, deeming it likely false. As reported, there is evidence that Silvercorp USA provided security for several Trump political rallies in 2018, but not of direct contact between Trump and Goudreau.\n\nReports also surfaced of Guaido\u2019s involvement in the operation \u2013 including a copy of a contract allegedly signed between Silvercorp USA and the Venezuelan opposition, published by the Washington Post. In it, Guaido is listed as \u201cCommander in Chief\u201d in the chain of command for the operation, but his signature does not appear on the document. The opposition had denied signing the agreement or participating.\n\nMaduro has long blamed the U.S. for his country\u2019s problems. Since Trump took office in 2017, relations have turned increasingly hostile. The U.S. has imposed strict economic sanctions \u2013 freezing Venezuelan government assets in the U.S. and banning commercial transactions in the South American nation, with the aim of pressuring Maduro to step down.\n\nIn its \u201cU.S. Relations With Venezuela\u201d fact sheet from July, the U.S. State Department wrote that \u201cthrough its assistance to the legitimate Guaido Interim Government and democratic organizations within and outside Venezuela, the United States supports the protection of human rights, the promotion of civil society, the strengthening of democratic institutions, and transparency and accountability in the country.\u201d\n\nBut, after the U.S. imposed another round of sanctions in 2019, United Nations Human Rights Commissioner Michelle Bachelet said that even though sanctions did not apply to transactions on food, clothing or medicine, they were \u201clikely to significantly exacerbate the crisis for millions of ordinary Venezuelans.\u201d\n\nVenezuela, once South America\u2019s wealthiest country, has been mired in an economic, political and humanitarian crisis since 2014. Inflation is rampant and many Venezuelans rely on outside humanitarian aid to survive. The latest National Survey of Living Conditions (ENCOVI) showed that around 96 percent of Venezuelans live in poverty, when measured by income levels.", "lang": "en"}
