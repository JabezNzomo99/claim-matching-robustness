Thanks to the Times for doing this quickly.\n\nThis claim is based on employment figures which don\u2019t tell us the number of new workers. It also defines \u2018foreigners\u2019 as people born outside the UK, including those who are UK citizens.\n\nThe Times\u2019 article reported the changes accurately, but the headline was wrong.\n\nThe claim is based on the headcount of people who work in the UK. About 32 million people were employed in July-September 2016\u2014almost half a million more than the year before.\n\nAs The Times says, 95% of the increase was made up of a change in the number of people born outside the UK.\n\nBut confusingly, only 53% came from a change in the number of non-British citizens.\n\nSo it matters who you class as a \u2018foreigner\u2019. Do you include anyone who was born outside the UK? Do you stop calling them a foreigner when they become a citizen? Or do you use some other standard all together?\n\nNeither group is a subset of the other. You can be in both born in the UK and be a UK citizen, you can be neither, or you can be just one of them.\n\nBoris Johnson, the UK\u2019s foreign secretary, is an example a UK citizen who was born in New York. He would be included in the Times\u2019 definition of \u2018foreigner\u2019.\n\nPerhaps more confusingly, these figures aren\u2019t actually telling us the numbers of new workers.\n\nImagine 20 people lose their job and 40 different people find one. The overall change is 20 more people in work, even though there are actually 40 \u2018new workers\u2019.\n\nThese employment figures just tell us the overall change. We know the number of people employed and unemployed in one year, and the number of people employed and unemployed in the next year. We also know their citizenship status and where they were born.\n\nSo we can say that more UK citizens and more foreigners (by any definition) are in work this year, than last year.\n\nBut these figures don\u2019t tell us how many people have been hired, fired or quit.\n\nNor do they tell us who gets what kind of jobs, who is winning or losing from immigration, or why the changes have happened in the way they do.\n\nSome statisticians have said it\u2019s statistically \"meaningless\" to make the kind of comparison the Times has done, and the UK Statistics Authority has cautioned against people making similar comparisons in the past.\n\nThe ONS does publish experimental statistics for the number of people entering and leaving work. It doesn\u2019t published breakdowns by nationality or country of birth, and told us that it wouldn't be possible in the foreseeable future.\n\nThis article was updated to include a response from the ONS.", "lang": "en"}
