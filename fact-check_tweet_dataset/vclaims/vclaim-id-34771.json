In terms of actual numbers, Rosstat reported that 18.9 million people were living below the poverty line in 2018, down from around 19.5 million in 2015-2017 but 3.5 million more than in 2012, when the fewest number of Russians were living in poverty -- 15.4 million.\n\nOther Russian state agencies and research institutions have disputed the Rosstat reports.\n\nYelena Grishina, the head of the laboratory of social analyses at the Russian Institute of Social Analyses and Prognosis (ISAP), a branch of the Presidential Academy of National Economy and Government Services, said the actual number of people living below the poverty line is around 36 million or 24.8-25.2% of the total population. That is nearly twice the official statistics.\n\nISAP, which monitors the socio-economic situation in the country and publishes monthly reports, says its reports are based on comparative data from three Russian federal agencies \u2013 Rosstat, the Treasury and the Central Bank.\n\nIn its most recent report, dated May 2019, the ISAP examined how a change in Rosstat\u2019s methodology for determining poverty statistics had affected its findings.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the transition of Rosstat to a new methodology for calculating income, the structure of monetary income of the population has changed significantly,\u201d ISAP reported, adding that the new methodology had yielded a smaller ratio between rich and poor and lower poverty statistics.\n\nWhile Rosstat reported that Russian incomes increased 0.2% during the first three months of 2019 compared to same period of 2018, according to ISAP, the \u201cactual monetary incomes of population have decreased by 2.3%.\u201d\n\nISAP also found that in the first three months of 2019, the proportion of \u201csubjectively poor people\u201d in Russia, who assess their financial situation as \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cvery bad\u201d rose to 29.6% from 25.3% in 2018.\n\nAs for Peskov\u2019s reference to the \u201cexternal economic conditions\u201d being the main reason for growing poverty in Russia, Alexey Kudrin has repeatedly rejected that argument.\n\nWhile Kudrin said in a recent interview that international sanctions are indeed \u201ctearing off\u201d 0.5% from Russia\u2019s GDP growth rate, he told the All-Russia Civil Forum in November 2017 that the poor quality of public administration in Russia was the main reason the government could not overcome problems like poverty.\n\n\u201cIn its current state, it cannot solve the problems we are talking about,\u201d Kudrin said.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin, speaking on June 20 during Direct Line, his annual nationally televised call-in television program, said Kudrin, known as a free economist, was \u201cdrifting\u201d toward the views of fellow economist Sergei Glazyev, who is an adviser to Putin on regional economic integration and is known for holding statist economic views.", "lang": "en"}
