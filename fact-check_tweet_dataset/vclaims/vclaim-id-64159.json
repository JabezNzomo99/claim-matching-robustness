No, that is not true. The cause of death for Robert Trump, who died at 71 on August 15, 2020, has not been officially released by the president, the family or the hospital.\n\nThe claim can be found in a post (archived here) published on Facebook on August 16, 2020. The post is simply a picture of a tweet from the day before. It read:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nSome reports have said that Robert Trump, whose services were being held in a private ceremony at the White House on August 21, 2020, died a few weeks after being injured in a fall. But no information or determination on the cause of his death have been officially released.\n\nReached by phone August 21, 2020, the Facebook poster, tax attorney and former Republican Senate candidate John Anthony Castro, told Lead Stories:\n\nCastro, a former candidate for the Senate from Texas who lost the March 3, 2020, Republican primary, started Castro & Co., an international tax attorney firm, in 2007.\n\nAccording to an August 15 New York Times story:\n\nThis also could not be confirmed by Lead Stories.\n\nThe White House released news of Robert Trump's death, and issued a statement from President Trump that said:\n\nCastro's tweet tying the death to COVID-19 is below:\n\nAgain, no official cause of death has been released by family, the White House, the hospital or any coroner, medical examiner or funeral home.\n\nA tweet from Paula Reid of CBS News said \"family and friends\" were expected for the service for Robert Trump in East Room of the White House, but the White House did not confirm the number of attendees:", "lang": "en"}
