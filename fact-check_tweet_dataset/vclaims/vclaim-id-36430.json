But as Hurricane Dorian threatened the east coast, President Donald Trump spread information that was overblown or inaccurate.\n\nDorian was a challenging storm to forecast. Still, Trump\u2019s exaggerations were easily avoidable.\n\nTrump tweeted the storm was headed to Alabama, only for his warnings to be batted down by the National Weather Service in Birmingham minutes later.\n\nHe also said he hadn\u2019t heard of a storm reaching Category 5, despite acknowledging the toll of such a hurricane on Florida\u2019s Panhandle at a rally four months ago.\n\n\"The public has come to expect factual information from presidents, and Trump\u2019s willingness to offer casual speculative thoughts about such matters is unusual,\" said David Greenberg, a Rutgers University professor of history and journalism. \"Trump\u2019s loose talk at best is embarrassing to him. At worst, it contributes to misinformation that can mislead the public.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to our questions.\n\nAmericans looking for reliable sources of information ahead of a massive hurricane like Dorian should consult the National Hurricane Center. Government-run emergency management agencies such as FloridaDisaster.org or county agencies also provide useful information about evacuations and shelters.\n\nTrump warned several times Sept. 1 that the Atlantic storm would hit several states much harder than expected \u2014 even reaching as far west as Alabama. Meteorologists quickly corrected this sweeping projection.\n\nIt started with a tweet at 10:51 a.m.: \"In addition to Florida - South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated. Looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever. Already category 5. BE CAREFUL! GOD BLESS EVERYONE!\"\n\nTwenty minutes later, the National Weather Service in Birmingham, Ala., corrected Trump without mentioning his name:\n\n\"Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east. #alwx,\" the weather service tweeted.\n\nTrump continued to muse about the storm\u2019s reach, saying at FEMA headquarters, \"And Alabama could even be in for at least some very strong winds and something more than that, it could be. This just came up, unfortunately. ... So, for Alabama, just please be careful also.\"\n\nTrump may have been referencing a NOAA map showing a 5% chance of tropical storm force winds nipping the southeast corner of Alabama.\n\nAfter days of news coverage critical of Trump\u2019s comments about Alabama, Trump gave a televised update about Hurricane Dorian on Sept. 4 next to what he called the \"original chart\" of the storm\u2019s path. It had been altered to extend the storm\u2019s cone to part of Alabama with a black circle.\n\nPresident Donald Trump holds a chart as he talks with reporters after receiving a briefing on Hurricane Dorian in the Oval Office of the White House Sept. 4, 2019, in Washington. (AP)\n\n\"It was going to hit not only Florida but Georgia, it was going toward the Gulf, that was what was originally projected,\" he said.\n\nThe White House and NOAA did not respond to PolitiFact\u2019s questions about who circled Alabama on the map. When reporters asked Trump whether the map had been drawn on with a Sharpie, Trump said, \"I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\"\n\nBut a White House photo from Aug. 29 does not show Alabama in NOAA\u2019s hurricane cone map. And NOAA\u2019s Dorian graphics archive for late August through Sept. 1 shows that the cone was centered over Florida and the Atlantic southeast coast \u2014 not Alabama.\n\nAs the storm intensified, Trump said he was not sure he had heard of a storm reaching Category 5. That\u2019s the highest tier of the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale for storms with sustained winds of 157 mph and higher.\n\n\"We don\u2019t even know what\u2019s coming at us. All we know is it\u2019s possibly the biggest. I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019ve ever even heard of a Category 5. I knew it existed. And I\u2019ve seen some Category 4s; you don\u2019t even see them that much. But a Category 5 is something that I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve even heard the term other than I know it\u2019s there. That\u2019s the ultimate. And that\u2019s what we have, unfortunately,\" Trump said.\n\nWhat makes Trump\u2019s comment more confounding is that he visited an Air Force base in northwestern Florida that sustained considerable damage from Hurricane Michael. That storm made history in 2018 as the first to hit the United States as a Category 5 since 1992.\n\nSpeaking of Hurricane Michael at a May 8, 2019, rally, Trump said, \"I've just come from a stop at Tyndall Air Force Base, where I saw the devastating effects of that Category 5 hurricane, Category 5. Never heard about Category 5s before, a Category 5 is big stuff.\"\n\nThere were three previous storms that made landfall in the continental United States as a Category 5: a Labor Day storm in the Florida Keys in 1935, Camille on the Gulf Coast in 1969 and Andrew in south Florida in 1992, according to NOAA. (The 1928 San Felipe Hurricane made landfall as a Category 5 Hurricane on Puerto Rico).\n\nDorian hit the Bahamas as a Category 5 storm Sept. 1. With sustained winds of 185 miles per hour, it tied the record with the Labor Day hurricane in 1935. It weakened as it approached Florida\u2019s east coast.\n\nUpdate: We updated this story Sept. 4 at 6:40 p.m. to include news of Trump's hurricane map with a black circle around parts of Alabama.", "lang": "en"}
