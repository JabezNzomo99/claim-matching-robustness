Francis \u201cChiz\u201d Escudero, who chairs the Senate banks committee probing Bautista, told VERA Files in a text message and subsequent phone interview that the investigation is still active and the arrest order still in effect:\n\nThe Senate banks committee probe stemmed from reports that the former poll chief has 35 separate accounts with the Luzon Development Bank totaling P329 million.\n\nIn February 2018, the Senate sought to arrest Bautista for refusing to attend hearings. Bautista, who has been in the United States since November 2017, maintained he had not received any invitations to attend a Senate probe.\n\nCongress voted to impeach Bautista in October 2017, hours after he announced his resignation.\n\nUPDATE: Responding to this post, Cruz-Angeles corrected her errors in a June 7 Facebook live video.\n\n\"I'm here to issue an erratum. They are correct,\" she said.\n\nPhilippine Daily Inquirer, House impeaches Comelec chief after he said he was resigning, Oct. 11, 2017\n\nWebsite of the Philippine Senate, Chiz says Bautista arrest warrant stays, March 19, 2018\n\nWebsite of the Philippine Senate, Chiz seeks Senate arrest of ex-Comelec chair Bautista, Feb. 12, 2018\n\nWebsite of the Philippine Senate, Resolution No. 468, Aug. 16, 2017", "lang": "en"}
