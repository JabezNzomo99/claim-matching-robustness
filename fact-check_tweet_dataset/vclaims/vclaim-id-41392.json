New President #Motilal Vora is not touching Rahul's feet for his blessings, he just slipped.\"\n\nHe latter on deleted the tweet citing \"some confusion over the picture\".\n\nThe same image was previously viral in December 2018 and BOOM had previously fact-checked the image which was taken during the swearing-in ceremony of Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel.\n\nThe person seen bowing in the photo is TS Singh Deo and not Motilal Vora as being claimed in the viral post.\n\nA side-by-side comparison of the black sandals worn by the man in the photo and by Deo in another photograph on his official Facebook page, confirm it is the same person.\n\nHindi newspaper Patrika had reported that Deo had bent down to pick up a stray thread emanating from Manmohan Singh\u2019s bouquet.
