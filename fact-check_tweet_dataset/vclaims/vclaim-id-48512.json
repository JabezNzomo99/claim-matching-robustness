McKinley abruptly resigned in October after the controversy over the administration\u2019s dealings with Ukraine erupted, in protest of what he told lawmakers was the use of ambassadors to advance domestic political objectives and a failure by the State Department to support those officials.\n\nPOMPEO: So, Mike McKinley served me well for a year and a half. I chose him. I had people tell me he was a great Foreign Service officer and in fact, he served America wonderfully for 37 years. He in fact had the office that was just \u2014 just behind mine, had a door that he could walk in any time and say whatever he wanted. You know, from the time that Ambassador Yovanovitch departed Ukraine until the time that he came to tell me that he was departing, I never heard him say a single thing about his concerns with respect to the decision that was made \u2014\n\nPOMPEO: George, again, I\u2019m not going to talk about private conversations that I had with my most trusted advisers. I think it\u2019s most appropriate that trusted advisers keep these conversations precisely where they are. Imagine if it becomes commonplace that a secretary of state would talk about things that his closest advisers said to him. I think you would agree, George, that that advice would change. People would be reluctant to speak. It wouldn\u2019t be appropriate. I don\u2019t intend to do that.\n\nBut Pompeo\u2019s efforts to avoid talking about the statement of support may have backfired on him by the time the House Intelligence Committee released the transcript of McKinley\u2019s interview. Pompeo\u2019s statement that \u201cnot once, George, did Ambassador McKinley say something to me during that entire time period\u201d was interpreted as talking about the statement of support \u2014 not the decision to oust Yovanovitch.\n\nIn the congressional deposition, McKinley related that he tried hard to get the State Department to issue a statement of support after the release of the transcript with Trump\u2019s criticism. He said he probably raised it directly with Pompeo three times \u2014 that was \u201cthe matter\u201d he was asked about. He described three conversations, saying that each time Pompeo simply refused to respond.\n\nHe added that he did not know why she was recalled. \u201cSo I can sit here and speculate, but it would be speculation. I saw nothing in writing,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard nothing. I heard no Department official speaking about the reasons for her recall.\u201d\n\nSo McKinley confirmed the point that Pompeo had said in the ABC interview \u2014 that McKinley had not raised the ambassador\u2019s ouster. But given that McKinley was not involved in Ukraine policy, there\u2019s little reason for him to do so. But he was involved in Pompeo\u2019s relations with the Foreign Service, which is why raising the statement of support was an important issue for McKinley.\n\nDuring a stopover in Germany on Thursday, Pompeo was asked again by a State Department correspondent about why he failed to back the statement of support. The reporter carefully noted that Pompeo already had said McKinley had not questioned Yovanovitch\u2019s ouster. Nevertheless, Pompeo deflected by again ignoring the actual question and instead talking about the ambassador\u2019s recall in May. We have highlighted the key sections below.\n\nQUESTION: Mr. Pompeo, Secretary Pompeo, you have said that Ambassador McKinley did not make known to you his objections over the recalling of Ambassador Yovanovitch, but he has testified that three times he directly appealed to you to make a statement in her support. You did not. Why not?\n\nPOMPEO: And as for Ambassador McKinley, I clearly follow this a lot less than you do. I haven\u2019t had a chance \u2014 it\u2019s a pretty busy world out there \u2014 haven\u2019t had a chance to follow this, but with respect to Ambassador McKinley, I think he said at the opening statement that he put out that he wasn\u2019t particularly involved in the Ukraine file, so it\u2019s not surprising that when Ambassador Yovanovitch returned to the United States, that he didn\u2019t raise that issue with me. That\u2019s \u2014\n\nPerhaps Pompeo thinks he\u2019s being clever here, repeatedly pretending to answer a different question. The issue is not whether McKinley raised Yovanovitch\u2019s recall \u2014 which he had no reason to do, given his position \u2014 but whether he discussed a statement of support for her with Pompeo. By his account, he brought it up three times, each time earning only silence from Pompeo.", "lang": "en"}
