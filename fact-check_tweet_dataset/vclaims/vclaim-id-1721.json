If ever you wanted a textbook example of the balance fallacy (when two sides of an argument are represented as having comparable value regardless of their merits), or of revenue-driven, shameless pseudoscientific clickbait, this would be the place to see it in the wild.\n\nOn one side of the debate you have NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. It is a large collection of professionally trained scientists, some of whom have spent decades specifically studying the science of asteroid tracking, engineers who are trained to operate multi-million dollar instruments to perform said tracking, and offices whose sole purpose is to monitor the trajectory of near earth objects. This organization\u2019s NEOWISE mission detected an object dubbed 2016 WF9 on 27 November 2016. After collecting enough data on its orbit, they reported that it was no threat to Earth on 29 December 2016:\n\nOn the other side of the debate (as framed by the Daily Mail), you have \u201cSelf-proclaimed Russian astronomer Dr Dyomin Damir Zakharovich\u201d who says NASA is lying, and that it will hit Earth on 16 February 2017:\n\n\u2018The object they call WF9 left the Nibiru system in October when Nibiru began spinning counter clockwise around the sun,\u2019 he said. \u2018Since then, Nasa has known it will hit Earth. But they are only telling people now.\u2019 If the asteroid hit Earth, he says, it could destroy cities or cause a tsunami. \u2018We are all in peril.\u2019\n\nThe UK tabloid Metro also reported on this mysterious astronomer:\n\nTwo quick notes on the Zakharovich hypothesis. The \u201cNibiru system\u201d refers to an as yet undetected planet in the outer reaches of our solar system, whose name is rooted in a misreading of ancient Babylonian texts, and which has been the basis for myriad predictions (many of which have come and gone) of our civilization\u2019s ultimate demise. While an undetected planet may well exist in our solar system, there is a fairly specific area in which it would be found, and nothing leaving that distant region of space in October is going to be hitting us this February \u2014 even if it were on the right trajectory.\n\nSecond, even the Daily Mail seems to think the man on whom they have based their entire article may not exist:\n\nWhat we do know for sure, though, is that all available data suggests it is not a risk to our planet. That data is sufficient enough for NASA to have mapped out a Lonely Planet-caliber tour guide for its trip through the inner solar system:\n\nIt\u2019s in an orbit that takes it on a scenic tour of our solar system. At its farthest distance from the sun, it approaches Jupiter\u2019s orbit. Over the course of 4.9 Earth-years, it travels inward, passing under the main asteroid belt and the orbit of Mars until it swings just inside Earth\u2019s own orbit. After that, it heads back toward the outer solar system. Objects in these types of orbits have multiple possible origins; it might once have been a comet, or it could have strayed from a population of dark objects in the main asteroid belt.", "lang": "en"}
