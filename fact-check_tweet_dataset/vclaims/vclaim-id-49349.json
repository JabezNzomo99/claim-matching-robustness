In the course of this fact-check, we will look at the following:\n\nAlt News performed a reverse image search on multiple keyframes of the viral video but could not find any relevant results.\n\nWe observed that the word \u201ccommando\u201d was written behind the t-shirts of one of the men.\n\nReaders should note that both tweets by @evazhengll and @CNPakWW have addressed the viral video as a chemical attack drill. Looking at the video, the smoke appears to be tear gas. Using these two points as a clue, Alt News performed a keyword search on YouTube and found three similar videos. As per the description, the videos show tear gas drills by National Security Guard (NSG), a counter-terrorism unit under the Ministry of Home Affairs.\n\nAlt News reached out to NSG officers via sources in the Indian Army. According to one of the officers, the viral video shows training for \u201cresistance to tear gas during civic action.\u201d\n\n\n\nWe analysed the Weibo logo on the top right corner of the viral video and noticed Chinese text below the logo.\n\nA keyword search \u2018\u706c\u9ed1\u793c\u670d\u706c\u2019 (translates to \u2018black dress\u2019 in English) revealed that the account belongs to a verified user on Weibo. This account has posted several videos related to the military.\n\nAlt News rummaged the user\u2019s timeline and found that they had posted the same video on June 28. This video is 15 seconds longer than the viral video. It was posted with the Chinese text, \u201c#China-IndiaBorderConflict# The Daily of the Indian Army: Training Smokescreen Adaptation Without anti-virus equipment, you can only improve your adaptability. Indian soldiers are powerful!
