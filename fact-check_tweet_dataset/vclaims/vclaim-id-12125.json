Cohen was guilty on many charges unrelated to me, but he plead [sic] to two campaign charges which were not criminal and of which he probably was not guilty even on a civil basis. Those charges were just agreed to by him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile many Americans who desired a particular outcome to the election knocked on doors, toiled at phone banks, or found any number of other legal ways to make their voices heard, Cohen sought to influence the election from the shadows,\u201d federal prosecutors wrote in a December brief for Cohen\u2019s sentencing. \u201cHe did so by orchestrating secret and illegal payments to silence two women who otherwise would have made public their alleged extramarital affairs with Individual-1 [Trump]. In the process, Cohen deceived the voting public by hiding alleged facts that he believed would have had a substantial effect on the election. \u2026 To promote transparency and prevent wealthy individuals like Cohen from circumventing these limits, Congress prohibited individuals from making expenditures on behalf of and coordinated with candidates.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Attorney is placing all his chips on the language \u201cfor the purpose of influencing an election.\u201d Intuitively, however, we all know that such language cannot be read literally \u2014 if it were, virtually every political candidate of the past 45 years has been in near-constant violation. The candidate who thinks \u201cI need to brush my teeth, shower, and put on a nice suit today in order to campaign effectively\u201d is surely not required to report as campaign expenditures his purchases of toothpaste, soap, and clothing. When he eats his Wheaties \u2014 breakfast of champions, and surely one cannot campaign on an empty stomach \u2014 his cereal and milk are not campaign expenses. When he drives to his office to start making phone calls to supporters, his gas is not a campaign expense.\n\nAnother Republican former FEC commissioner, Hans von Spakovsky, wrote that these hush-money payments shouldn\u2019t count as campaign funding. Regardless of his presidential bid, Trump was such a celebrity that he would have had to pay off alleged mistresses anyway, he wrote, and the law doesn\u2019t restrict expenses that arise \u201cirrespective\u201d of a candidate\u2019s campaign. \u201cIf Khuzami\u2019s legal theory is correct \u2014 that any payments made to settle such a claim are campaign-related expenditures because they are intended to protect the reputation of a candidate and thus influence the election \u2014 a lot of members of Congress are in potential trouble,\u201d von Spakovsky wrote.\n\nJustice Department prosecutors argued that the payments to Hunter from two Edwards donors were illegal campaign contributions meant to keep the affair hidden from voters in 2008. Edwards\u2019s attorneys said the payments actually were meant to hide the affair from the senator\u2019s wife. The New York Times reported that the Edwards case \u201cshows the risk of charging a politician with campaign-finance crimes over hush-money payments to mistresses, in which it is unclear whether the transactions were about trying to win an election or trying to protect the candidate\u2019s personal life.\u201d\n\nBut there are some big differences setting apart the Edwards and Trump cases. Unlike Trump, Edwards admitted to the affair. His biggest donor, Bunny Mellon, didn\u2019t know her money was going to Edwards\u2019s mistress, according to a friend of Mellon who testified at trial. Cohen not only knew where the money was going, but he also admitted to the whole detailed scheme in court. Edwards never had to deal with this kind of nightmare scenario \u2014 seeing his lawyer flip and admit crimes to influence an election.\n\nIn April 2012, the FEC released an audit of the [Obama] campaign that found that the committee did not disclose the identities of the 1,312 donors responsible for nearly $2 million in contributions in the final weeks of the campaign. Those donations made up one-quarter of 1 percent of the $778 million raised for his White House bid. The infractions found in the audit were relatively minor considering the volume of contributions, campaign finance experts said at the time. \u201cOverall, this is a very clean audit report for the Obama campaign. The FEC spent two years picking over $750 million in contributions and expenses and found one violation,\u201d former Republican FEC chairman Michael Toner told Reuters at the time.", "lang": "en"}
