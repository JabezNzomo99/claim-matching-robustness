As far as we can determine, the assets distributed to Fred C. Trump\u2019s descendants before and after his death in 1999 has not been revealed. The Daily News in 2000 cited family estimates that his estate was worth $100 million to $300 million but The New York Times recently found documents in Queens Surrogate Court that show that Fred Trump, in his will, divided $20 million among his four surviving children, among other distributions after estate taxes. (The will was contested by the children of his oldest son, Fred C. Trump Jr., who had passed away.)\n\nTrump\u2019s father, like most wealthy individuals, also set up trusts before he died. Donald Trump admitted in a 2007 deposition that he borrowed at least $9 million from his future inheritance when he encountered financial difficulties. The documents (appended at the end of this article) suggest some property\u2014worth, after expenses, about $30 million\u2013was kept in trust after Fred Trump\u2019s death to provide income to his wife, who died in 2000. So that also was presumably divided by the children after her death.\n\nTrump\u2019s father \u2014 whose name had been besmirched in New York real estate circles after investigations into windfall profits and other abuses in his real estate projects \u2014 was an essential silent partner in Trump\u2019s initiative. In effect, the son was the front man, relying on his father\u2019s connections and wealth, while his father stood silently in the background to avoid drawing attention to himself.\n\nFred Trump\u2019s signature on the guarantee ensured the new hotel would get built. \u201cNo document in the long paper trail attached to the Commodore deal better demonstrated the lack of bank confidence in the Donald or the project, and none made clear the limits of his promoter role,\u201d Barrett wrote. Trump simply did not have the credit or connections to obtain such financing on his own. \u201cIt was Fred\u2019s two-decade-old relationship with a top Equitable officer, Ben Holloway, that had helped entice them to do the project.\u201d\n\nIn 1976, The New York Times published a fawning profile of Trump in which he was quoted as saying he was worth $200 million, even though he was only 30. But that figure \u2013which has been widely cited \u2013 was false, according to examination of Trump\u2019s finances in 1981 by the Casino Control Commission. (The document is embedded below.)\n\nTrump\u2019s tax returns at the time indicated his salaried income in 1976 was less than $100,000 a year, which he received as an officer in his father\u2019s company. (His father remained chief executive of the company.) His income taxes reported $76,000 in income in 1975, $25,000 in income in 1976 and $118,000 in income in 1977. He paid no income tax in 1978 and 1979 as he reported negative income, likely because of tax shelters.\n\nTrump also benefited from three trusts that had been set up for family members. In 1976, Fred Trump set up eight $1 million trusts, one each for his five children and three grandchildren, according to the casino document. (That today would be worth about $4 million in inflation-adjusted dollars.) The 1976 Trust paid Trump $19,000 in 1977, $47,200 in 1978, $70,000 in 1979, $90,000 in 1980 and $214,605 in 1981. Trump also received about $12,000 a year from a 1949 trust set up by his father and nearly $2,000 a year from another 1949 trust created by his grandmother. He also received a $6,000 gift every December from his parents.\n\nIn 1993, according to the 2005 book \u201cTrumpNation,\u201d by Timothy O\u2019Brien, the children of Fred C. Trump expected to receive about $35 million each when their father passed away. With his casinos failing in the early 1990s, Donald Trump needed to borrow about $10 million to fund his living and office expenses but could offer no collateral to his siblings. He later sought another $20 million but his siblings balked, and a smaller amount was arranged, O\u2019Brien said.\n\n[Update, Oct. 3, 2018: A lengthy New York Times investigation exposes even more of this myth. After examining more than 100,000 confidential documents, the Times concluded that the\u201csmall loan\" was actually $60.7 million, or $140 million in 2018 dollars, and much of it was never repaid. The article, which exposed various tax schemes used by the Trump family, also said Trump was highly dependent on his father\u2019s wealth: \u201cBy age 3, he was earning $200,000 a year in today\u2019s dollars from his father\u2019s empire. He was a millionaire by age 8. In his 40s and 50s, he was receiving more than $5 million a year.\u201d]\n\nMoreover, Trump\u2019s claim that he built a real-estate fortune out of a \u201csmall\u201d $1 million loan is simply not credible. He benefited from numerous loans and loan guarantees, as well as his father\u2019s connections, to make the move into Manhattan. His father also set up lucrative trusts to provide steady income. When Donald Trump became overextended in the casino business, his father bailed him out with a shady casino-chip loan\u2014and Trump also borrowed $9 million against his future inheritance. While Trump asserts \u201cit has not been easy for me,\u201d he glosses over the fact that his father paved the way for his success \u2014 and that his father bailed him out when he got into trouble.", "lang": "en"}
