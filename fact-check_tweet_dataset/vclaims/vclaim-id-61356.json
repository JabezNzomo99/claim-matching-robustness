Scott Walker\u2019s message that \"Wisconsin is back on\" after the Great Recession. Burke\u2019s allies repeat the claim.\n\nOne example, from a Burke campaign television spot that first aired in July 2014:\n\n\"It\u2019s Walker\u2019s agency that gave millions in tax breaks to companies that relocated jobs overseas. Another reason Wisconsin\u2019s dead last in Midwest job growth.\"\n\nAs this is spoken, the TV spot rolls through a list of nine states before settling on Wisconsin at the bottom: North Dakota, Michigan, Indiana, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois.\n\nWith a new Walker TV ad bragging that we\u2019re third in the Midwest in job growth, we thought it was time to look at both claims. In both cases, and like so many claims in a campaign that any numbers nerd would love, evaluation depends on two things: the timeframe and the measuring stick.\n\nIn the Burke ad, the narrator in the spot doesn\u2019t say what time frame was analyzed.\n\nBut the fine print in the ad cites data collected for the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. And the footnote says the ad compares quarter four of 2010 -- the last before Walker took office -- to quarter four of 2013. That is still the latest available quarterly data.\n\nThat data, reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, is considered the most exhaustive and credible for employment trends. It is based on a census of 96 percent of all American non-farm employers.\n\nOur examination of the data for the three-year period cited by Burke shows Wisconsin 10th out of the 10 states -- \"dead last\" -- just below Illinois when it comes to growth in private-sector jobs.\n\n\"The low growth in jobs in Wisconsin has been matched by very low income growth and poor levels of consumer spending,\" University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee labor economist John Heywood told us. \"The state has been slower than its peers in recovering from the recession.\"\n\nBurke ranks the states by the percentage of growth. That is preferred by economists for state-by-state comparisons because it shows performance regardless of the state\u2019s population.\n\nBy another measure -- raw number of jobs created -- Wisconsin ranked sixth-best of the 10 states, we found.\n\nThere are two statistical points to consider.\n\nThe most important is the definition of \"Midwest.\"\n\nBoth Burke and Walker use the 10 states we mentioned. There\u2019s a good case to be made for that: The Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Midwest regional office covers those 10 states.\n\nWe found other instances in which the agency adds Missouri and Kansas into the Midwestern mix, for a total of 12 states. In that larger group, Wisconsin finishes 11th of 12, ahead of Missouri.\n\nPreviously we rated Half True a Burke claim in January 2014 that Wisconsin was last in the Midwest. The numbers worked out, but we faulted Burke mainly for a too-narrow comparison. She said Midwest, but looked only at the four states adjoining Wisconsin.\n\nWe noted that at that time, before the 2013 numbers were complete, that Ohio and Nebraska (from the group of 10) and Missouri (from the more expansive BLS group of 12) had slower growth rates than Wisconsin.\n\nFinally, because it\u2019s so comprehensive, reporting of the quarterly jobs data lags by at least six months, meaning the picture may be a bit outdated by the time it is released.\n\nThe next quarterly jobs figures, covering the first quarter of 2014, are set for mid-September release.\n\nThere is more recent jobs data available, from the monthly Current Employment Statistics surveys, but it\u2019s based on a sample of only about 3 percent of employers. Those figures are prone to large margins of error but are also a widely cited source on job trends.\n\nWalker has called the quarterly data the \"gold standard,\" and has criticized the monthly data. But he has cited the monthly data, and does so in his new ad.\n\nBurke has used both at various times as well.\n\nIndeed, she was using the less-reliable monthly data back when we rated her earlier worst-in-Midwest claim Half True.\n\nMary Burke contends that \"Wisconsin\u2019s dead last in Midwest job growth.\"\n\nIn the new version of this claim, she uses the most accurate jobs data for the longest Walker-era period that can be analyzed with it. And Wisconsin does bring up the rear. But due to the lag time, it does not reflect the most current trends.\n\nVoters will hear many more jobs claims before the Nov. 4 election. Here are five tips for separating fact from fiction -- and hype from hard evidence -- when it comes to candidates and the numbers they use.\n\u2022 Check the timeframe: If the statement covers a short period, it can be a red flag for cherry-picking data to find a good result. A longer time frame may be being used to mask more recent changes.\n\u2022 Check the data source: The quarterly jobs numbers are more accurate than the monthly figures, but also more out of date. Be more skeptical of recent announcement about the monthly numbers, because they are subject to revisions can be significant.\n\u2022 Raw numbers or percentages?: If the claim is that State X added more jobs than State Y, the statement may have limited information value. Look for percentage growth figures that level the playing field among states of varying sizes.\n\u2022 Check the map: When the claim is \"best in the region,\" trust but verify. Are all relevant states included?\n\u2022 Scrutinize the sector: Most claims focus on just the private sector, but sometimes partisans will add in public employees if it suits their purpose.", "lang": "en"}
