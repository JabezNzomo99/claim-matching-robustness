In a freewheeling interview with NBC News, Boehner dismissed the idea that special interests or gerrymandered congressional districts undercut what Washington does for the average citizen. And ditto for the billions of dollars that fuel the American political system.\n\n\"We spend more money on antacids than we do on politics,\" Boehner told Meet the Press host Chuck Todd on May 3, 2015. \"We live in an imperfect democracy. But as bad as it is, let me tell you this. It\u2019s better than any other place in the world.\"\n\nThat struck us as a novel comparison. Do Tums and Rolaids lay a bigger claim to Americans\u2019 paychecks than electioneering?\n\nWe dug into the numbers, and while we are confident that Boehner could tell us how he spells relief when it comes to taxes, his math leaves something to be desired.\n\nBoehner\u2019s spokesman Kevin Smith pointed us to two articles. One from the trade publication spoke of a $10 billion yearly market for antacids. The other from the nonprofit organization that tracks political money, the , said total spending on federal campaigns in 2014 was $3.7 billion.\n\nThe problem is, that antacid number was for sales worldwide. In America, the total is about $2 billion. We found that estimate from a couple of sources. The business website reported $1.96 billion in sales of antacid tablets in 2013. That excludes liquid antacids.\n\nWe found for both tablets and liquid antacids. Liquid antacid sales add about 5 percent more to the total -- $1.6 billion in tablets compared to about $83 million for liquids. Assuming the same trend held in 2013, we\u2019re looking at a total sales figure around $2 billion.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of indigestion, but it\u2019s less than the amount spent on the 2014 federal elections. The most recent data from the Center for Responsive Politics actually puts the total closer to . That includes spending by the candidates\u2019 campaigns, the party committees, Super PACs and outside groups. Even if we limit the tally just to candidates and the parties, there was still more than $2.7 billion spent.\n\nBoehner\u2019s comparison gets into deeper trouble when state-level races are factored in. The National Institute on Money in State Politics reports in spending in 2014 to elect governors and members of state legislatures.\n\nWith or without factoring in state money, Boehner\u2019s comparison doesn\u2019t come close.\n\nBoehner said Americans spend more on antacids than they do on politics. But the evidence Boehner\u2019s office cited was based on worldwide antacid sales. Americans themselves spent more than $2 billion on antacids each year, reports show. Federal campaign spending tops that no matter how you cut it. Using the source provided by Boehner\u2019s office, the total in 2014 was about $3.8 billion. Factoring in state elections makes the disparity even greater.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t swallow this claim. We rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
