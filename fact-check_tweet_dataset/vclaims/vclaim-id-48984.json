Janel Brandtjen, R-Menomonee Falls, offered this tweet targeted at Evers:\n\n@Gov Evers liquor stores are open, strip malls can have 5 customers, but dentists are non-essential?!\n\nIs she right?\n\nWere dentists considered non-essential under the safer-at-home order?\n\nLet\u2019s start with the order itself: Executive Order #28.\n\nUnder Section 13, essential businesses include healthcare and public health operations. And, elsewhere within the order, dental offices are classified under healthcare and as public health operations. So, that order did not block dentists from seeing patients.\n\nMeanwhile, an online map from the American Dental Association that tracks the extent to which dentists nationwide have been able to offer services shows the vast majority of states, including Wisconsin, allowing elective and emergency procedures. Of those, as of May 14, 2020, the map showed seven states allowing only emergency procedures. (No state had dentist offices closed entirely.)\n\nBeyond that, Wisconsin is listed among only four states \u2013 including California, Rhode Island, and Delaware \u2013 that explicitly designated dentists as essential.\n\nThat said, the American Dental Association has recommended dentists remain open only for emergency procedures and postpone elective procedures. And the Wisconsin Dental Association follows ADA recommendations.\n\nSimilarly, the state Department of Health Services recommends dentists follow guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which include postponing elective procedures and non-emergency visits.\n\nSo, on a practical level, many dentist offices held off on doing routine visits, such as cleanings and checkups. But that was due to their own choice, and consistent with guidelines from dental groups and health agencies. It was not forbidden under Evers\u2019 order.\n\nWhen asked for backup for the claim that dentists were deemed nonessential, Brandtjen didn\u2019t cite the order itself.\n\nRather, in an email, she said Wisconsin dentists planned to start opening their offices in early May, but claimed the state Department of Health Services notified the Dentistry Examining Board that those who did could put their licenses in jeopardy.\n\nJennifer Garrett, communications director for the Department of Safety and Professional Services, said examining board members were advised by legal counsel May 6, 2020, that dentists should follow DHS guidelines, and could face penalties if they did not.\n\nBut, as evidence, that is off point, particularly with such a narrow claim.\n\nAs noted, the Evers order declared dentists essential \u2014 the opposite of what Brandtjen claimed.\n\nBrandtjen tweeted that under orders from Evers, dentists were classified as non-essential, and therefore had to remain closed.\n\nBut Evers\u2019 order \u2014 unlike those from many other governors \u2014 explicitly declared dentists, like other health care workers, were essential. Thus, they were allowed to stay open, even if many chose to limit their offerings to emergency work.", "lang": "en"}
