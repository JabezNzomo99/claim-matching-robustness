It is based entirely on a fabricated story originally posted by a satirical blog.\n\nA website called Massachusetts Daily posted the article on Jan. 6 with the headline, \"Nancy Pelosi Assures Iran That Trump Will \u2018Pay For His Crimes.\u2019\"\n\nThe article was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe Massachusetts Daily story states that Pelosi \"may have just committed treason\" after she allegedly sent a letter to Iran\u2019s embassy, apologizing for the killing of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani and insisting Trump would pay. The article goes on to say that Pelosi apologized in advance for upcoming military strikes and said she was sorry \"for any inconvenience.\" None of it is true.\n\nThis concocted account was copied and pasted word-for-word from a post by a satire blog called \"Taters Gonna Tate.\" That site contains a disclaimer that says, \"Everything on this website is fiction.\"\n\nThe Massachusetts Daily website, on the other hand, contains no such disclaimer. Its home page contains a number of stories that are simply made-up like this one.\n\nWe rate this story Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
