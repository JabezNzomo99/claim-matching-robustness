However, the claim shared along with the image that this happened after India supplied HCQ tablets to the country is false. With a keyword search on Twitter, Alt News found a tweet by the official handle of the Indian embassy in Switzerland. According to a tweet, the Indian tricolour was projected on the Matterhorn mountain to express solidarity to all Indians in the fight against COVID-19.\n\nThe same photo was put out by the official Instagram handle of Zermatt Matterhorn\u2019s tourism website. \u201cHope and strength to all Indians,\u201d said the message posted along with the image.\n\nAccording to the tourism website of Zermatt Matterhorn, flags of several other countries fighting the pandemic were projected on the mountain, not just the Indian tricolour. You can see the images of the mountain lit up with national flags of India, China, America, Japan, Germany, Britain, Spain, France, and Italy.", "lang": "en"}
