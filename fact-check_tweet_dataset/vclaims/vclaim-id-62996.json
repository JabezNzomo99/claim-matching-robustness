Currently, everyone stops paying the Social Security payroll tax once wages reach $137,700, a level that increases each year with inflation. In effect, there would be a gap between about $140,000 and $400,000 in which people would stop paying the payroll tax, but that gap would narrow over time and eventually disappear because Biden would not make the $400,000 threshold subject to inflation.\n\nBut when you dig into the distributional tables produced by these groups, you see they estimate some of the burden from the tax increases would fall on people making less than $400,000. The amounts are relatively small, according to Penn Wharton \u2014 an average of $15 for the bottom quintile, $90 for the second quintile, $180 for the middle quintile and $360 for the fourth quintile. But those numbers are in the tables, which is why McDaniel claims 82 percent of Americans would face higher taxes.\n\nHow to address the impact of corporate tax increases (or reductions) on after-tax income has long been the subject of heated debate among economists beyond the scope of this fact check. When Trump cut the corporate income tax rate, the calculations worked in his favor because the models assumed corporations would raise workers\u2019 wages and thus after-tax income \u2014 something that does not yet appear to have occurred. By reversing some of Trump\u2019s tax cut for corporations, Biden gets dinged by the same tax models.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about whether middle-class people will have to pay more taxes. Clearly they won\u2019t,\u201d said Austan D. Goolsbee, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Barack Obama. \u201cThis is an argument about whether making corporations pay more income taxes would trickle down into lower workers\u2019 wages. Anyone who believes that there would be significant trickle down needs to explain why the massive corporate rate cut in 2017 was almost entirely kept by shareholders and why child-care credits, health-care credits or other items in the Biden plan wouldn\u2019t generate the similar secondary benefits to workers.\u201d\n\nJohn Ricco, senior analyst at Penn Wharton, agreed that \u201cthe line between spending and taxes is blurry and not always meaningful. For example, the premium tax credit could easily have been structured as a direct outlay rather than being administered through the tax code. So for this analysis, we chose to focus on the revenue raisers only. It is true that lower income groups would almost certainly be net beneficiaries when considering the entire fiscal package.\u201d\n\nSperling said the impact of the Biden tax plan should be measured on how it affects individuals when they have to calculate their taxes. \u201cEven if you buy the very questionable idea that a corporate tax increase would negatively impact lower- and middle-income workers, it is just not correct to look at that as a tax increase,\u201d he said. \u201cConsider people filling out their 1040 \u2014 or any tax form. There will not be even one taxpayer making less than $400,000 who at the end of doing their taxes will be able to say, \u2018I am now facing higher taxes,\u2019 while millions and millions will be able to say they are paying less.\u201d\n\u2022 None A plan to curtail tax savings from itemized deductions for all taxpayers in tax brackets above 28 percent could affect some people making as little as $163,000. \u201cWe would only apply the 28 percent cap to those earning more than $400,000,\u201d a Biden adviser said.\n\u2022 None A proposal to shift some of the benefits of tax deferral in traditional retirement accounts toward lower- and middle-income earners could reduce the benefits for people earning above $80,250, but under $400,000. \u201cIn our retirement proposal, we would hold harmless those below $400,000,\u201d the Biden adviser said.\n\u2022 None The payroll tax hike could negatively affect some two-income households where one spouse (say, a doctor) makes $450,000, but another (a restaurant owner) suffers a $100,000 loss. Even though the family adjusted gross income would be below $400,000, they would face a tax increase. \u201cWe find that a small number (a fraction of a percentage point) of families below $400,000 would see their taxes go up due to the payroll tax provision,\u201d Ricco said in an email. The Biden adviser responded: \u201cThe higher payroll tax levy will only be assessed on tax units with income over $400,000. In any circumstance in which someone might pay more, guardrails will be put in place to make them whole.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
