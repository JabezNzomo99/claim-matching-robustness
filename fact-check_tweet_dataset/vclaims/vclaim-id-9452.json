However, North Korea voted against the March 2014 UN resolution calling on member states not to recognize any change in the status of Crimea.\n\nThat resolution passed, with 100 member states voting in favor, 11 against and 58 abstaining. Along with Russia and North Korea, Armenia, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Nicaragua, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Zimbabwe voted against the measure.\n\nRussia is a veto-holding member of the UN Security Council, and since the vote took place in the General Assembly, the resulting resolution is non-binding.\n\nThe General Assembly affirmed in the resolution its \u201ccommitment to the sovereignty, political independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.\u201d\n\nThe General Assembly further urged \u201call States to desist and refrain from actions aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nFollowing the resolution, Russia continued to support separatist rebels in Ukraine, and to occupy Crimea, despite its own rhetorical support for upholding international law and respecting national sovereignty.\n\nMoscow has also denied that the \u201clittle green men\u201d wearing uniforms without insignia and spotted in Crimea after the ouster of Ukrainian President Yanukovich in 2014 were, in fact, Russian military forces.\n\n\u200bChristian Marxsen, a senior research fellow with the Heidelberg, Germany-based Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law, has analyzed Russia\u2019s actions in Crimea from the perspective of international law.\n\nHe concluded that Russia used \u201cthe threat of force\u201d during the 2014 events in Ukraine, and that, after the Crimean referendum, its troops openly took \u201ccontrol of Crimea, seized Ukrainian military equipment, and forced Ukrainian troops to surrender.\u201d These unjustified actions, Marxsen wrote, \u201cviolated Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and this situation is perpetuated by the integration of Crimea into Russia\u2019s territory.\u201d\n\nSpeaking after the 2014 UN vote supporting Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, Ukraine\u2019s then Interim foreign minister, Andrii Deshchytsia, said of Russia\u2019s actions in Crimea: \u201cMany still struggle to grasp the reality \u2013 it happened in Ukraine, in the very heart of Europe. It happened in the 21st century.\u201d\n\nWestern countries have since imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in response to its actions in Ukraine.", "lang": "en"}
