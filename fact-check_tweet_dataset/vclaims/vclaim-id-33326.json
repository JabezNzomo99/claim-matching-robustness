The Congress party has targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the ruling BJP via a tweet highlighting the poor state of the river and the lackadaisical attitude of the government which \u201chas focused on lip service rather than getting anything done\u201d.\n\nSeeking to corner the government over the \u2018atrocious completion rate\u2019 of projects related to the cleaning of the river with the rather dramatic hashtag #MaaGangaSeDhokha, the party has posted a photograph, showing the Ganga river in a dirty state.\n\nThe photograph used by the Congress party in its tweet is not recent. Using the reverse image search tool, Alt News came across links which had posted this very photograph in 2009 and 2010.\n\nThese websites claimed that this is a river in Israel. Using the date and time filter on Google, we searched for results restricted to 2009 and 2010. This led us to a Romanian website which had posted this photograph, claiming that it was clicked at Varanasi in April 2009. The name of the photographer was mentioned as Prakash Singh. We searched the text accompanying the photograph and found a link to the website of Getty Images, a repository of photographs.\n\nAccording to Getty Images,by Prakash Singh, depicting scavengers who were looking for valuable items among the offerings of devotees.\n\nIn the infographic shared by Congress, it has been claimed that out of 187 projects undertaken under Namami Gange or National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), only 47 have been completed. The Namami Gange programme was launched immediately after the Modi led NDA government came to power in 2014, with the objective of conservation and rejuvenation of the river.\n\nWhile verifying the data, we found that this claim pertains to data provided in Lok Sabha in February 2018. According to the latest data from NMCG website, from financial year 2011-12 to 2018-19, 236 projects have been sanctioned of which 63 projects have been completed. According to the last available data before the present Union Government came into power, by March 2014, 72 projects had been initiated under National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGBRA) of which 16 were completed. The NGBRA was the agency responsible for planning, coordination, implementation and monitoring for the Ganga river. NGRBA was dissolved with effect from the 7th October 2016, consequent to constitution of National Council for Rejuvenation, Protection and Management of River Ganga (referred as National Ganga Council).\n\nThe death of G D Agarwal who succumbed to his indefinite fast demanding concrete measures for the conservation of the Ganga river has once again brought this lingering issue into the limelight. However, in its rush to berate the Prime Minister and the government over the continuing state of the river, the Congress party rather embarrassingly ended up using a photograph of 2009, when the UPA government was in fact in power at the centre.", "lang": "en"}
