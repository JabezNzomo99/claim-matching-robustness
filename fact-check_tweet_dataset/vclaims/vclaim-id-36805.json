But before the big game, Twitter users called out the NFL star for an old tweet about George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who was acquitted of criminal charges on July 13, 2013, in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.\n\nThe Miami Herald reported that Mahomes was 17 when he responded to a high school classmate\u2019s tweet that day about Zimmerman\u2019s trial.\n\nThe classmate\u2019s tweet said: \"This case was an absolutely horrible tragedy, however there was no criminal activity that occurred.\"\n\nMahomes replied: \"No one knows what actually happens which is why he is not guilty but a crime could have occurred.\"\n\nTwitter users shared that tweet and another screenshot of a tweet from 2011, in which Mahomes responded to another account and said: \"stop resisting or assaulting a cop #realcops.\"\n\nAs the Herald documents, Twitter users started using the tweets, which have since been deleted, as evidence that Mahomes supports Zimmerman.\n\nBut a Jan. 14 blog post on MTONews.com goes further with this headline: \"NFL Star Patrick Mahomes: \u2018I believe George Zimmerman is INNOCENT\u2019!!\"\n\nIt goes on to say that Mahomes believes Zimmerman is not guilty and that he supports the trial\u2019s verdict.\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
