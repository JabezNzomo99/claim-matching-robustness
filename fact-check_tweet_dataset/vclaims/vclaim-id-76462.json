In 2015, PolitiFact ruled Mostly True claims from Hillary Clinton a claim that ,\"Under Republicans, recessions happen four times as frequently as under Democrats,\" and another that, \"The stock market does better when you have a Democratic president in the White House.\" At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, former President Bill Clinton had this statement rated True: \"Since 1961 \u2026 our private economy has produced 66 million private-sector jobs. So what's the jobs score? Republicans 24 million, Democrats 42 (million).\"\n\nThe score, however, isn\u2019t as good for this particular Clinton claim.\n\nClinton\u2019s Arizona spokesman, Tim Hogan, pointed us to a July 2014 study on the topic from Princeton University economists Alan Blinder and Mark Watson.\n\nThe study concludes that Democratic presidents do have more Gross Domestic Product growth than Republicans, according to quarterly GDP data dating back to 1947, when the data was first tracked.\n\nHowever, the economists point out that there are other factors, such as better oil prices and international conditions, that could be driving these better numbers for Democratic presidents. In short, Democrats occupying the Oval Office tend to have a little better luck.\n\nExperts we spoke with largely held the same views.\n\nHarvard University government professor Jeffrey Frankel said the statistics, from GDP to the unemployment rate, are striking, but noted that the president does not have \"all that control.\"\n\n\"That doesn\u2019t prove what the cause is,\" Frankel said. (Update: After this item published, we heard from Frankel who said he believed Clinton's statement was accurate because Clinton did not say that Democrats caused the gap in performance. You can read more on his views here.)\n\nRobert Shapiro, chairman of Washington D.C. economic advisory firm Sonecon, said Clinton is right, but with the same caveat.\n\n\"The details, of course, depend on how and what you compare, since the economy performs better in certain periods than others,\" Shapiro said.\n\nChristian Weller, a public policy professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston, did his own math on the GDP data since 1947.\n\nHe found that the economy, through the last quarter of 2015 and after inflation, grew 3.8 percent under Democrats and 2.4 percent under Republicans.\n\nFor President Barack Obama, the growth rate in his first term was 1.8 percent. His current growth rate is 2 percent, but that\u2019s still higher than his predecessor, George W. Bush. And his second term hasn\u2019t ended yet.\n\nBased on estimates, Weller said Obama should hit the 2.4 percent Republican average. Still, Ronald Reagan\u2019s 3.4 percent growth rate is well ahead of the economy right now under Obama.\n\n\"Other than Obama, every Democrat had a faster growth rate, even (Jimmy) Carter had a slightly higher growth rate than Reagan,\" Weller said. \"This is one of the safest talking points for a Democratic contender.\"\n\n\"Secretary Clinton is not exactly telling the whole truth,\u2019\" Simpson said.\n\nSimpson referenced Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, noting that he benefited from some of the economic policies of his predecessor, Republican George H.W. Bush. A 2011 report from the right-leaning Heritage Foundation notes that the economy was already in its \"22nd month of expansion\" when Bill Clinton took office in January 1993.\n\nHillary Clinton said, \"the economy always does better when there\u2019s a Democrat in the White House.\"\n\nYes, Democratic presidents do have more Gross Domestic Product growth than Republicans, according to quarterly GDP data dating back to 1947.\n\nBut Clinton's comments require several caveats. The current growth in the economy under Obama is lower than the Republican average. Factors such as oil prices also reflect the higher GDP growth under Democratic presidents. On top of that, comparing one period of time to another or one president to another can be problematic.", "lang": "en"}
