However, Telugu was indeed ranked the second-best script at the 2nd World Alphabet Olympics held in Bangkok in 2012.\n\nThe message is mostly being circulated on WhatsApp. To verify the claim, we ran a search on the Internet with the keywords \"Telugu second-best script\" and found a related report on a Korean news website published in October, 2012.\n\nAccording to this report, Telugu was ranked the second-best script in the 2nd World Alphabet Olympics held in Bangkok from October 1-4, 2012. In this contest, Korea's Hangeul writing system had won the first position, whereas English stood at number three.\n\nWe also ran a search to find out about \"International Alphabet Association\", and it directed us to the website of International Phonetic Association. However, we did not find any details about the World Alphabet Olympics or any related event on this website.\n\nAs per a blog published on the ITCSA (Indian Telugu Civil Servants Association website, World Alphabet Olympics is an event that selects the most distinguished alphabet among all the writing systems created or modified in the world.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that the viral post claiming that Telugu has been voted the second-best script in the world by the International Alphabet Association is misleading. There is no such organisation called \"International Alphabet Association\". Telugu was ranked the second-best script in the 2nd World Alphabet Olympics held almost eight years back.", "lang": "en"}
