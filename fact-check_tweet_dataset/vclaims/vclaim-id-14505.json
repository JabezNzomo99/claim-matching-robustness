In a recent court filing, prosecutors laid out extensive contact on a possible deal through 2016 between Cohen, then an executive vice president of the Trump Organization, Felix Sater, a Russian-born businessman with a checkered past, and numerous Russian nationals, including the press secretary for the president of Russia.\n\nWe\u2019ve previously outlined the connections between members of Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia. But Cohen was technically not part of the campaign, even though he was a close adviser. Because the president\u2019s business and political worlds are intertwined, as a reader service, the Fact Checker compiled a timeline of what happened, what the president knew and what he said publicly about contact between his staff and Russia.\n\nAt the same time, Cohen was working toward a deal that would license Trump\u2019s name to a skyscraper in Moscow. According to court documents, Cohen updated Trump and Trump\u2019s family on the project more than three times between September 2015 and June 2016, but it is not clear exactly when these briefings took place. The timeline below outlines how the campaign and the Moscow project intersected.\n\nSeptember and October 2015: Cohen and Sater, who had worked on previous real estate proposals for Trump in Russia, began discussions about a potential deal. According to The Washington Post, \u201can unidentified investor planned to build the project and, under a licensing agreement, put Trump\u2019s name on it.\u201d Sater believed that, with Trump\u2019s publicity from the campaign, it would be perfect timing. He began to contact former contacts in Russia and put together a licensing deal for the Moscow project fairly quickly.\n\nJan. 20: Cohen heard back from Peskov\u2019s office and spoke with his assistant for 20 minutes. During that call, according to court documents, Cohen outlined the Moscow project and asked for assistance to move it forward. Cohen initially told Congress that he had never heard back from Peskov. Peskov corroborated this false claim in August 2017 when he said he had received an email but \u201cleft it unanswered.\u201d (After Cohen\u2019s new admission, Peskov displayed the emails to reporters and confirmed that Russian officials contacted Cohen by phone.)\n\nMay 4-6: Cohen and Sater discuss the possibility of a trip to Russia that would include Trump. They debate whether it would be better for him to visit before or after the Republican National Convention in July. On May 5, Sater relays a message that a Russian official would like to invite Cohen to the \u201cDavos of Russia\u201d in June where he would be introduced to Putin and/or Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. Cohen agrees to the trip. According to the sentencing memorandum filed by Cohen\u2019s team, he continued to update Trump through June.\n\nMay 21: Then-advisers Carter Page and George Papadopoulos suggest to the campaign that Trump travel to Russia. Papadopoulos forwards a May 4 email exchange to newly minted campaign chairman Paul Manafort, saying, \u201cRussia has been eager to meet Mr. Trump for quite some time and have been reaching out to me to discuss.\u201d Manafort then forwards this email to his deputy, Rick Gates, writing, \u201cWe need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips.\u201d Gates agreed and passed the exchange along to \u201cthe person responding to all mail of non-importance,\u201d aiming to avoid a response from a senior official.\n\nJan. 11, 2017: Trump tweets: \u201cRussia has never tried to use leverage over me. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA - NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!\u201d In a news conference that day, Trump says: \u201cI tweeted out that I have no dealings with Russia. I have no deals that could happen in Russia because we\u2019ve stayed away. And I have no loans with Russia.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
