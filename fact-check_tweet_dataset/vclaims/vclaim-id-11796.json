Speaking on his clandestine Radio Biafra, last year, shortly after President Muhammadu Buhari returned from one of his medical trips abroad, the rebel declared that the President was dead and that an impostor, one Jubril Aminu Al-Sudan was the one in the presidency pretending to be Nigeria\u2019s President.\n\nThe rumour mill went into overdrive as the President was known to be seriously ill before he went abroad.\n\nThe rumour gained further impetus when the ban on political activities was lifted. Following the acrimony generated by the All Peoples Congress Primaries, many party big wigs like Governor Rochas Okorocha who felt aggrieved that their preferred candidates did not emerge as the governorship candidates of their states, threatened to work against their parties. Damaging political statements like claim above were credited to them.\n\nThe statement credited to Rochas, on the surface seems plausible, given the background of events. Rochas, for instance encouraged his preferred candidate, who is also his son-in-law and many of his followers to defect to another party.\n\nWhen, therefore, the claim was attributed to Rochas by the online platform: www.ecocitytvews.com in November 2018, not a few people believed the claim.\n\nA photograph of an emir and an unknown man, genuflecting to Okorocha, who sat on an upholstered chair, was cited as evidence. The unknown emir was said to be the Sultan of Sokoto, S\u2019aadu Abubakar.\n\nA close look at the photograph will reveal that the man in the photograph was not the Sultan.\n\nSecondly, the Vice-President and even the President himself have addressed the issue of the so-called Jubril or \u2018Buhari Double\u2019.\n\nThe Jubril Al-Sudan issue is a product of the fertile imagination of the enemies of the President.\n\nWhen contacted on the issue, the Sultan simply told the reporter: \u201cGo and ask Rochas.\u201d\n\nRochas\u2019 chief press secretary, Sam Onwuemeodo, simply snapped: \u201cPlease don\u2019t ask me this kind of question. Settle with your source.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
