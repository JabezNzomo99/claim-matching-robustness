{"title": "Wayfair: The false conspiracy about a furniture firm and child trafficking", "subtitle": "It's gone global, and involves a US-based furniture company and unfounded allegations of human trafficking.", "author": "www.bbc.com", "date": "2020-07-15T18:40:56.000Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-58907", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-53416247", "vclaim": "What is the Wayfair conspiracy theory?\n\nThe claims originated in the QAnon community - many of whom believe in a far-right conspiracy theory that there's a secret plot by a supposed \"deep state\" against President Trump and his supporters.\n\nThe user pointed out that the cabinets were \"all listed with girls' names,\" prompting followers to allege that the pieces of furniture actually had children hidden in them as part of a supposed child trafficking ring.\n\nBy that point, QAnon followers were making supposed links between the fact that some expensive pieces of Wayfair furniture are named after girls, and actual cases of missing children in the US with the same names.\n\nSome of these children are no longer missing and one woman, who was mentioned when a cabinet with her first name was linked to her alleged disappearance as a teenager, did a Facebook live refuting the claims.\n\nWhat is Wayfair saying?\n\nWhen it comes to why some of its items are named after children, Wayfair has explained that the company uses an algorithm to name its products (other retailers also use first names to brand their products).\n\nIt acknowledged that the high prices listed may have led to confusion, but says the particular cabinets are large \"industrial size\" items meant for business or commercial use.\n\nA spokesperson told BBC News: \"We have temporarily removed the products from our site to rename them and to provide a more in-depth description and photos that accurately depict the product to clarify the price point.\"\n\nWayfair has refuted this, and put it down to a price glitch on their website. The same sorts of glitches can be seen sometimes with other online sellers.\n\nWhere has the Wayfair conspiracy spread?\n\nAccording to data from CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned social media analytics tool, the term Wayfair has generated 4.4 million engagements on Instagram. It also spread rapidly on public groups and pages on Facebook, resulting in more than 12,000 posts and nearly a million direct engagements.\n\nHas this happened before?\n\nThe conspiracy theory became so big it resulted in a US man opening fire in the pizza restaurant in question.", "lang": "en"}
