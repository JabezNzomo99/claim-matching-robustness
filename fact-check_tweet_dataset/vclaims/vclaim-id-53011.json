It shows the back of a woman, whose body can be seen hanging from a tree.\n\nThe caption says that a 16-year-old girl was raped by a man named Naseer Khan and murdered, following which her body was left hanging to a tree.\n\nIn other posts, the girl is referred to as belonging from the Dalit community.\n\nOther posts can be seen here.\n\nALSO READ: Is Muslim panel under AYUSH Ministry responsible for restrictions on Patanjali\u2019s\u2026\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above posts and found that the claim attached to the pictures is false.\n\nWe Googled the keywords \u2018Sapotara woman death\u2019 and came across a Hindustan Times article, dated July 22, 2019.\n\nThe article stated that, \u201ca 19-year-old woman was allegedly murdered and then hanged from a tree in an isolated forest area near Sapotara town of Rajasthan\u2019s Karauli district, police said on Saturday. The victim was allegedly strangled first and then hanged from the tree at Bapoti village, police said. Police circulated the picture of the woman among locals. After hours, the victim was identified as Pooja Meena.\u201d\n\nUpon digging further, we also came across another report on Lallantop dated July 2019 that shows the same images with the story as reported by Hindustan Times.\n\nWe then searched Google for Pooja Meena Karauli Sapotara death and came across a Dainik Bhaskar article that identifies the suspect as her lover Mahendra Meena.\n\nIn conclusion, the above information proves that the pictures are one year old. It incorrectly identifies a 19-year-old as 16-year-old and does not mention any Muslim suspect by the name of Naseer Khan. The recent post with the same image is misleading.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
