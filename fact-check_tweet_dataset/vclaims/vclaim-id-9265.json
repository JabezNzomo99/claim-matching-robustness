Clinton has been subjected to various conspiracy theories concerning her health, and on 7 August 2016 the web site NTMY News published (what sadly should have been painfully obvious) fake news reporting that Donald Trump had dropped out of the presidential race due to a brain tumor discovered during a \u201ccolonoscopy\u201d:\n\nAfter a tough week in the polls, Donald Trump has dropped out of the presidential campaign. Trump\u2019s public relations vice president John Miller spoke to the press. \u201cDonald Trump had a routine medical exam, which included a colonoscopy. During that part of the examination, it was discovered that Mr. Trump has stage one brain cancer. In order to focus on treatment, he has decided to withdraw his bid for the presidency.\u201d Miller, who gave the release by phone, explained that Trump\u2019s campaign was not at all influenced by the existence of a tumor and that everything \u201cThe Donald\u201d had said to date should be taken at face value.\n\nNeedless to say, we hope, this story was a complete fabrication. NTMY News is an entertainment web site that publishes \u201cpolitical news and satire,\u201d and this article was clearly the latter.", "lang": "en"}
