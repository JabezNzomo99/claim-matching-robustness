Lewis describes in the 1942 book \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Letters to His Nephew\u201d how people are being led to Hell through their \u201cfear of getting sick.\u201d\n\nLewis never wrote a book titled \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Letters to His Nephew.\u201d There is no evidence Lewis ever wrote the words attributed to him in the post.\n\nThe Facebook post features an illustration of a masked figure playing the flute while leading children, who appear to be wearing surgical masks, through the woods. It is accompanied by a long block of text that reads like a dialogue between two individuals.\n\n\u201cAnd how did you manage to bring so many souls to hell at that time? -Because of fear,\u201d reads the post. \u201c-Ah, yes. Excellent strategy; old and always current. But what were they afraid of? Fear of being tortured? Fear of war? Fear of hunger? -No. -Fear of getting sick.\u201d\n\nThe quotation, allegedly from Lewis\u2019s 1942 book \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Letters to His Nephew,\u201d goes on to describe how the \u201cfear of getting sick\u201d led people to \u201cnot hug or greet each other,\u201d \u201cnot leave their house\u201d and \u201cnot visit their relatives,\u201d among other things. Such behaviors parallel the social distancing practices many people have implemented during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBut the Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence Lewis ever actually wrote the passage being shared. It does not appear in \u201cThe Quotable Lewis,\u201d a book that contains more than 1,500 verified quotes from the \u201cChronicles of Narnia\u201d author, nor in any of his writings. In fact, Lewis did not write a book titled \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Letters to His Nephew.\u201d\n\n\u201cLewis NEVER wrote a book called, \u2018The Devils Letters to His Nephew\u2019 and it is NOT in The Screwtape Letters,\u201d wrote William O\u2019Flaherty of the Essential C.S. Lewis website in a blog post debunking the passage. (RELATED: Did C.S. Lewis Say, \u2018You Are Never Too Old To Set Another Goal Or To Dream A New Dream\u2019?)\n\n\u201cThe Screwtape Letters,\u201d a novel that Lewis published in 1942, examines theological concepts through letters exchanged between the demon Screwtape and his nephew Wormwood. Though the alleged passage appears nowhere in it, that epistolary novel may have inspired the long quote making the rounds on social media platforms.\n\n\u201cOver the years there have been many who have written a \u2018Screwtape Letter,\u2019 meaning they wrote in the same style that Lewis did,\u201d Flaherty wrote on his website. \u201cSome clearly state they were not written by Lewis and others seem to think it is more clever to not mention this fact.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
