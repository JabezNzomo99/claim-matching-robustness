Clarke Jr., it\u2019s often more like heavy-metal thunder.\n\nIn a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Jan. 31, 2014, Clarke revealed plans to explore a possible run for mayor of Milwaukee in 2016.\n\nThe sheriff called three-term Mayor Tom Barrett politically vulnerable and lacking vision. Then he lowered the boom.\n\n\"I have 7,800 reasons to be critical of Mayor Barrett,\" Clarke contended. \"That's about what I pay in property taxes per year.\"\n\nAs every Wisconsin property taxpayer knows, when property tax bills show up each December, they show dollar-signs from a handful of governmental bodies.\n\nSo, how is it that Barrett is responsible for the entire amount of Clarke\u2019s property tax bill?\n\nThat would be some heavy-metal power.\n\nWe plugged Clarke\u2019s home address, on Milwaukee\u2019s far northwest side, into the city to see his latest property tax bill, for 2013.\n\nThe record shows Clarke paid $7,728 in property taxes, a bit less than the $7,800 he said in the interview.\n\nBefore about $200 in credits, Clarke's bill broke down this way:\n\nBottom line: The city\u2019s levy accounts for only about one-third of Clarke\u2019s property tax bill.\n\nEven at that, responsibility for the city\u2019s portion can\u2019t be put entirely on Barrett.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the of each town, village, city, county and school district, as well as the state, levies the total amount of property tax to be raised. The amount is based on the size of each entity\u2019s budget and how much in property taxes, in addition to other revenue, will be needed to fund the budget.\n\nAs mayor, Barrett plays a pivotal role in how much Milwaukee collects in property taxes. He proposes the city budget and can veto changes made by the Common Council, although ultimately aldermen could override his vetoes.\n\nThe Milwaukee mayor also appoints seven of the 11 commissioners for the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District. But MMSD sets its own property tax levy.\n\nMeanwhile, Milwaukee Area Technical College District board members, who are appointed , set MATC\u2019s levy. And levies for Milwaukee County, Milwaukee Public Schools and the state are set by elected representatives of those bodies.\n\nWhich is to say, Barrett has little or nothing to do with the lion\u2019s share of Clarke\u2019s property tax bill.\n\nClarke said Barrett is responsible for the roughly $7,800 \"I pay in property taxes per year.\"\n\nBarrett has significant influence over how much Clarke pays in property taxes to the city, but that amounts to only about one-third of Clarke\u2019s tax bill.\n\nYou can comment on this item on the Journal Sentinel's web site.", "lang": "en"}
