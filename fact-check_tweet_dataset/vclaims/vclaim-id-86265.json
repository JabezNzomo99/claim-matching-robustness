But it\u2019s hard to get an accurate fix on where any lawmaker fits along the ideological spectrum, particularly one who served as long as Biden, as it depends on the methodology used to assign a bill as liberal, moderate or conservative.\n\nTauberer told The Fact Checker that \u201cif I had to put a number on it, I\u2019d say the left one-third of Democrats could be in the \u2018most liberal\u2019 category, which would translate to roughly the 83rd percentile overall. Of the 19 Congresses Biden served in, he was in the left one-third just once and it was in the 94th Congress,\u201d 1974-75. (Note: the Voteview scale puts Biden at 70 percent in this Congress, which indicates how the results can differ greatly depending on what is being measured.)\n\nThere is also an ideological rating scale conducted by the National Journal, which in 2007 gave Biden a 94 percent overall liberal score, but also as low as 59 percent in 1997. Brendan Nyhan, a public policy professor at the University of Michigan, said National Journal\u2019s ratings are not as reliable an indicator as Voteview because National Journal looks only at a selected subset of votes, not all votes, which results in a wide variation of the ratings from year to year.\n\n\u201cWhether it was introducing one of the first-ever bills to fight climate change in the United States Congress, writing the Violence Against Women Act, or defeating the NRA to ban assault weapons from our streets, Joe Biden has a monumental record of progressive accomplishment from his time in the Senate,\" said campaign spokesman Andrew Bates. \"As Vice President, he went on to lead the biggest clean energy investment in American history and fought to move the Affordable Care Act over the finish line. He\u2019s running to be the force for change that rebuilds the American middle class and propels the country into the future, and his record will be a major asset in that effort.\u201d\n\nBiden said he was labeled one of the most liberal members of Congress. Within the context of 100 senators, Biden was right on the cusp, according to two respected metrics of ideology \u2014 not quite in the top tier of liberals, but neither was he a moderate or conservative Democrat. One could argue he was not in lockstep with the most liberal elements of the party, but liberal enough that Republicans would feel little hesitation to fling the epithet at him.\n\nIf Biden had said he was one of the most liberal Democrats, that would be in the Two or Three Pinocchio range. So much depends on what votes one values as critical to that assessment. Instead, Biden said he was labeled one of the most liberal Democrats. Within the context of the U.S. Senate, Republicans certainly viewed him as a liberal and said so. That tips us more toward One Pinocchio.", "lang": "en"}
