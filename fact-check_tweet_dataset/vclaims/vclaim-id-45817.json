Both the South African Police Service and local politician Adriana Randall said the claims made in the post were misleading. The images used in the post are also falsely presented as they are taken from unrelated matters. False \u2013 The primary claims of the content are factually inaccurate. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
