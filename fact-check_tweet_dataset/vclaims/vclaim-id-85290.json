I support #CABBill. I strongly denounce the protests launched by my muslim brothers across the nation. They either didn\u2019t understand the bill and have been manipulated or they\u2019re knowingly targeting the govt as a political move. But I\u2019m very proud of it. Jai Hind\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\u201d, claimed the users.\n\nThe \u2018declaration of support\u2019 comes in the wake of the passing of Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) by the parliament on December 11, 2019. President Ram Nath Kovind on December 12 gave his assent to the Citizenship Amendment Bill, 2019, turning it into an Act. The opposition has criticised the bill as being discriminatory on religious grounds. The Act offers citizenship to refugees from all South Asian religions, except Muslims, fleeing oppression in neighbouring countries, namely Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.\n\nHowever, when Alt News looked up the profiles and previous tweets of people declaring support for the Act, we found that several among them used to identify as Hindus. The sudden shift to Muslim identities unsurprisingly happened in the wake of CAB.\n\nTwitter handle @thegirl_youhate posted a tweet on March 10, 2019, saying, \u201cI\u2019m hindu bruh\u201d. This handle has identified itself as Arti Pal on multiple occasions.\n\n\u201cBhai mai hindu hu\u201d, replied Twitter handle @ambersariyaaaa when a user passed a communal slur. At the time of writing this article, a tweet where the handle claimed to be a Muslim who supports CAB has garnered close to 500 retweets.\n\nOn April 26, 2019, a Twitter user who goes by the handle @NeecheSetopper tweeted, \u201ci am hindu\u201d.\n\n\u201cPower of hindu. Proud to be a hindu,\u201dposted Twitter handle @NamanJa82028342who now has declared support to CAB as a Muslim.\n\nA Twitter user with the name BaashaBhai posted a message on April 16, 2019, where he said, \u201cI am a Hindu have never looked at anyone as Hindu , Muslim or a Christian but there are many who show up their hatred for Hindus / Hinduism openly!\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am a hindu, and I will not step back again. I am a hindu and this will be hindu rashtra again,\u201d tweeted a user named Dehati Intellectual who also supported CAB by posting the same text on December 14, 2019.\n\nTwitter user \u2018Khadija\u2019 also tweeted the text and expressed her support as a Muslim. However, in a separate tweet, she declared herself as Arpita Gouttam.\n\nA concerted effort was made on social media to project widespread support from the Muslim community for the Citizenship Amendment Act.", "lang": "en"}
