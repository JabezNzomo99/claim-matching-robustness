The main policing policy criticism of de Blasio is his reining in of the controversial \u201cstop and frisk\u201d program, according to several experts and a review of news coverage.\n\nTapping into public dissatisfaction with stop-and-frisk, de Blasio promised to end the program if elected. He described himself as \u201cthe only candidate to end the stop and frisk era that targets minorities.\u201d In January 2014 \u2014 his first month as mayor \u2014 de Blasio decided to drop the city\u2019s appeal and agreed to the supervision by a court-approved monitor for three years.\n\nBy the time de Blasio took office, the program already was on its way out. After the number of stops peaked at nearly 700,000 in 2011, it began declining. In 2013, there were fewer than 200,000 stops. In 2014, there were just under 46,000, according to NYPD data.\n\nHuckabee says shootings are up 20 percent from a year ago, in June 2014, but that is not correct. On June 28, 2014, there were 145 murders and 594 shooting victims in New York City. The day of Huckabee\u2019s speech, there were 161 murders and 633 shooting victims in New York City. So the number of shooting victims is up 6.6 percent from a year ago.\n\n\u201cBasically, you can look at a blip and say that crime is increasing. But if you take a step back, you\u2019ll see that crime is decreasing,\u201d said Inimai Chettiar, director of the justice program at New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice. (See this graphic below by Matt Friedman, the Brennan Center\u2019s economist.)\n\nWhether stop-and-frisk effectively reduced murder and violent crime is debatable. A 2014 New York Civil Liberties Union report showed that the decline in shootings and murders did not correspond with increase in stops. The federal judge who ruled the practice unconstitutional also found that in 98.5 percent of the 2.3 million frisks between 2004 and 2012, no weapon was found.\n\nHuckabee also may be referring to the policy under de Blasio and Police Commissioner William Bratton to reduce the number of arrests for small amounts of marijuana, by issuing summonses instead. But drug-related violence has ebbed for years, and the police have not made any connection between murder rates and the policy, according to the Times.\n\nCriminologists warn against blaming or crediting an executive or a single policy for changes in crime trends. Murderers don\u2019t care who the mayor is. And many factors \u2014 including weather and the economy \u2014 affect crime rates, and can\u2019t be connected to a single policy. They also note that New York City is a part of a nationwide reduction in murder and violent crime over the past two decades, even in cities without stop-and-frisk or similar policies.\n\nHe did not specify exactly which policy he is referring to under de Blasio, but the one policy that the mayor has been blamed for \u201creversing\u201d is stop-and-frisk. The program was deemed unconstitutional and stops had declined sharply by the time de Blasio took office. De Blasio ran on a promise to end the program, and dropped the city\u2019s appeal as soon as he took office in January 2014. But it is important to remember that de Blasio agreeing to court monitor is not the same as \u201creversing\u201d the program \u2014 and that in 2013 a federal judge even said the program had decreased and the crime rate has continued to fall.", "lang": "en"}
