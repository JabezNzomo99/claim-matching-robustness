Gavin Newsom defied his own stay-at-home order to vacation in Montana.\n\n\"While California is dying, not because of COVID, but because of the Newsom/Democrat lockdown, I hear Gavin is vacationing in Stevensville, MT!\" said a May 18 Facebook post, adding that locals should \"tape confirmation and share their videos.\"\n\nRELATED: The false TikTok claim that high unemployment is killing more people than the coronavirus\n\nThe post accused Newsom of being \"a criminal\" and included an image that showed the governor with his arm raised alongside the words: \"You stay while I vacation.\"\n\nIt was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) According to the Associated Press, social media users have been claiming Newsom fled to Montana for weeks.\n\nThe content of the post is wrong. For starters, COVID-19 has killed thousands of Californians \u2014 more than 3,600 as of May 22, according to Johns Hopkins University. More to the point, Newsom is not on vacation in Montana, nor has he been there in recent weeks.\n\n\"The governor and his family have been in California for the duration of the pandemic,\" said Jesse Melgar, Newsom\u2019s press secretary.\n\nNewsom has provided live updates about the state of the coronavirus in California throughout May, broadcasting them to his YouTube channel and social media pages. On May 18, he gave a press conference from Mustards Grill, a restaurant in Napa, California.\n\nMontana officials said they\u2019re not aware of any recent trips Newsom has made to their state.\n\n\"Gov. Newsom was not in Montana to our knowledge,\" said Erin Loranger, press secretary for Montana Gov. Steve Bullock.\n\n\"We can confirm that Gov. Newsom has not been in Stevensville,\" added Stevensville Mayor Brandon Dewey.\n\nWe searched Google and the Nexis news database and found no credible reports to indicate that Newsom has been to Montana in recent weeks. Other fact-checkers and local news outlets also concluded that posts saying Newsom went there were wrong.\n\nCalifornia law dictates that Newsom must be within the state\u2019s borders to have the powers of his office, according to the Los Angeles Times. When Newsom has left California in the past, he has typically transferred the governor\u2019s duties to Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis.\n\n\"When the governor leaves the state, he is required to give notice, and the lieutenant governor serves as acting governor in his absence,\" said Katie Hanzlik, a spokesperson for Kounalakis.\n\nBut Kounalakis\u2019 office hasn\u2019t received notice that Newsom would be out of California since early February, Hanzlik said. She shared with PolitiFact a pair of press releases, from Feb. 7 and Feb 11, that said Newsom \"has left the state\" and \"has returned to the state.\"\n\nOn Feb. 10, Newsom appeared as a guest on ABC\u2019s \"The View,\" which is filmed in New York.\n\nThe parents of Newsom\u2019s wife, filmmaker and actress Jennifer Siebel Newsom, do own a ranch near Stevensville. The two got married there in 2008, when Newsom was mayor of San Francisco, according to an Associated Press report from the time.\n\nNewsom issued a stay-at-home order on March 19, and he recently loosened the criteria that counties must meet in order to begin easing some restrictions.\n\nA Facebook post said, \"While California is dying \u2026 Gavin (Newsom) is vacationing in Stevensville, MT!\"\n\nThere is no evidence of this. Newsom\u2019s office said he has not been vacationing in Stevensville, and so did the lieutenant governor\u2019s office, the Montana governor\u2019s office and the Stevensville mayor. Newsom gave a live press conference from a California restaurant on May 18, the day the post went up.", "lang": "en"}
