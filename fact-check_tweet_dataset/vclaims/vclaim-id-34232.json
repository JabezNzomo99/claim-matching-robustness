Hanks is sixth cousins with Rogers, and they share the same great-great-great-great-great grandfather, Johannes Mefford, a company representative told CBS News. The company utilized its database of over 20 billion online historical records to form Hanks\u2019 family tree, the representative said.\n\nWe have no reason to doubt Ancestry.com\u2019s claim. However, some readers may not quite understand just how distant a distant cousin really is.\n\nThe genealogy website reported that Rogers and Hanks are sixth cousins who share a 5x great-grandfather (or a great-great-great-great-great-grandfather). Here\u2019s how Ancestry.com described Hanks relationship to Rogers:\n\nFred Rogers and Tom Hanks are sixth cousins sharing the same 5x great-grandfather, Johannes Mefford, who immigrated from Germany to America in the 18th century. Johannes raised a family of patriots; three of his sons (including Tom Hanks\u2019 and Fred Rogers\u2019s ancestors) served in the Revolutionary War. Fred Rogers\u2019s 4x great-grandfather, William Mefford, served in the navy and was captured by the British in 1782. He endured life on a prison ship in Barbados and Antigua until he was released ten months later. Tom Hanks\u2019s 4x great-grandfather, Jacob Mefford, joined the War as a private and participated in a skirmish at Chesapeake Bay. So, Rogers and Hanks not only share the same ancestor, they also descend from two brothers who fought for America\u2019s independence.\n\nWhile it may be \u201ctrue\u201d to say that Hanks and Rogers are related, phrasing their relationship this way is a bit misleading.\n\nWe found varying estimates about just how closely related sixth cousins really are, but the general conclusion was that these \u201crelatives\u201d were very distant. For instance, a study by Ancestry DNA in 2014, based on British birth rates and census data, found that the average person in Britain had about 175,000 sixth cousins.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that Hanks and Rogers are related, they are distant cousins who probably don\u2019t share much in terms of DNA. But don\u2019t let that take away from Hanks\u2019 performance as Rogers in \u201cA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\u201d:\n\nWe reached out to the Association of Professional Genealogists and the International Society of Genetic Genealogy.
