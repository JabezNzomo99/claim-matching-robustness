Jamia Millia Islamia(JMI) University and Shaheen Bagh became centres of anti-CAA protests in the country, making them a top target of such campaigns.\n\nNow, a social media post containing combined images of a topless woman(Image 1) and Muslim women interacting with All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) party head, Asaduddin Owaisi(Image 2) has gone viral across different social media platforms.\n\nViral posts claim that one of the women (highlighted in red) speaking to Owaisi is the same person shown topless in the left side of the image.\n\nFacebook user Sanjeev Tapasvi, shared the post with the text, \"\u0936\u093e\u0939\u0940\u0928 \u092c\u093e\u0917 \u0915\u0940 \u0926\u0942\u0938\u0930\u0940 \u0936\u0947\u0930\u0928\u0940 \u0938\u092c\u0940\u0928\u093e \u092c\u093e\u0928\u094b \u0915\u093e \u0928\u0940\u0932\u093e \u0930\u0902\u0917\u0940\u0928 \u091a\u0932 \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u092e\u093f\u0932\u093e \u0939\u0948..!!\ud83e\udd23 \u0926\u094b\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094b \u0908\u0938 \u0936\u093e\u0939\u0940\u0902\u0928 \u0936\u0947\u0930\u0928\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u092d\u0940 \u092b\u0947\u092e\u0936 \u0915\u0930\u094b\ud83d\ude02(Shaheen Bagh's lioness-Sabina Bano's blue picture has been discovered..!! Friends, please make this lioness famous)\".\n\nKeyword search led to several such posts on Twitter making similar claims. \n\n\n\nThe semi-nude image is of anti-CAA protester.\n\nReverse image search led to many pornographic websites matching the topless woman from Image 1. Besides photographs, we also found matching video clips of the woman. We have decided not to share the link to the search results in the probability that the viral photo was leaked without the consent of the woman.\n\nSimilar searches on Image 2 allowed us to identify the women interacting with Owaisi as JMI students Ladeeda Farzana & Ayesha Renna. According to The NewsMinute report, the photograph is from an Anti-CAA event that took place in Hyderabad on 21 December, 2019.\n\nLadeeda Farzana, a BA Arabic student, became the face of JMI fraternity's protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act, after a video of her shielding a fellow student from the police went viral.\n\nThe Logical Indian reached out to Ladeeda Farzana over the viral post. \n\n\n\n\"The posts are neither shocking nor new. Anyone who criticizes or raises their voice against the Sangh Parivar is a target of such false campaigns. Recently, a fellow student of JMI, Safoora Zagar, was also targeted on similar lines. Such incidents only reinforce my resolve, I will continue to protest and seek justice. They can't silence me,\" Farzana said.\n\nThe topless woman's facial comparison with the student activist further confirmed that they are not the same person.\n\n\n\nTherefore, given the evidence, it can be ascertained that unrelated image were shared with the false claim to defame JMI University student Ladeeda Farzana.\n\nSame viral image was also fact-checked by Alt News.\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Fact Check: Tweeple Character Assassinate Safoora Zargar, Spread Fake Rumours About Her Pregnancy", "lang": "en"}
