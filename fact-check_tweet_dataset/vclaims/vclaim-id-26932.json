She named the Internet news portal T-online.de, Bild, and Deutsche Welle in support of her allegations.\n\nZakharova vowed that Russia was going to file a complaint with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) about Germany\u2019s alleged violation of the freedom of the media, particularly since criticism was also coming from the public broadcaster Deutsche Welle. According to her, the reason for such a campaign was allegedly a request by the German establishment for \u201csuppressing the voice of the Russian and Russian-language mass media.\u201d\n\nEarlier in January, the German Association of Journalists (DJV) urged the state media regulatory authorities not to grant a broadcasting license to the channel Russia Today for its website RT Deutsch.\n\n\u201cRussia Today is not an information medium for us, but a propaganda instrument of the Kremlin, which tries to make politics with disinformation,\" said DJV Federal Chairman Frank \u00dcberall. He added that, RT \"has repeatedly invented stories in the past.\" There should not be a broadcasting license for a propaganda station.\"\n\nFollowing Zakharova\u2019s press conference on January 31, DJV issued a statement saying that there was no campaign against Russian foreign media in Germany, there is only \u201cunanimous criticism toward the methods of their work.\u201d\n\nThe editor-in-chief of T-online.de Florian Harms, and Christian Mihr, the Managing Director of the German office of \u201cReporters without Borders,\u201d an International NGO based in Paris, joined in denying the Russian allegations.\n\nThe German government also rejected Russian MFA\u2019s accusations that German press, in cooperation with the government, are waging a campaign against Russian media. Government spokesperson Steffen Seibert said, \u201cThose who spread such unfounded claims have little to no idea of Germany and little idea of freedom of the press. I explicitly reject such allegations.\u201d\n\nTalking to T-online.de, the new leader of the Christian Democratic Union Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer denounced what she called \u201caggressive attacks\u201d of the Russian government against the German media.\n\nAmerican analyst Vladimir Socor told Polygraph.info that the German media is indeed very critical of Russia\u2019s lack of democracy. The four largest national newspapers, the right-of-center leaning Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Die Welt and Bild as well as the left leaning S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, are all critical of Russian influence operations in Germany. The newspapers editorially oppose the prospective Russian gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea, Nord Stream 2. The German government, on the other hand, takes a stand of cautiously criticizing Russia on democracy grounds, but making deals with Moscow on practical grounds.\n\n\u201cBut Berlin is concerned about potential Russian interference in the upcoming elections for EU parliament,\u201d said Socor who resides in Germany.\n\nDonald Jensen from the Center for European Policy Analysis in Washington said that Moscow's reaction is typical of the Kremlin when RT is criticized in the West.\n\n\u201cIn fact, RT is a state propaganda organization that seeks to advance Russian foreign policy objectives. In Germany, these are the construction of Nord Stream 2, the fostering of popular anxiety over immigration, and supporting that portion of the German political and business class, which promotes closer ties with Russia,\u201d Jensen said.\n\nSocor noted that the Russian MFA spokesperson\u2019s strong accusations, however, reveal Moscow\u2019s changed expectations of Berlin. Russian officials usually use this kind of language to criticize countries they consider partners. With the German government supporting Nord Stream 2, Socor said Moscow is sending a message that it will not tolerate criticism of its society, media or means of foreign influence.\n\nRT and Sputnik face mistrust not only in Germany, but throughout most of Europe, including Britain and France. The French government has opened an investigation into possible Russian interference during the Yellow Vest protests last year, when social-media accounts linked to Moscow spread false news published by Russia Today and Sputnik.\n\nAn earlier fact check established that Moscow used the two outlets to undermine Emmanuel Macron\u2019s presidential election campaign in 2017.\n\nMacron has stated openly in the presence of Russian President Vladimir Putin that \u201cRussia Today and Sputnik were agents of influence and propaganda that spread falsehoods about me and my campaign.\u201d\n\nAnd in December 2018, UK\u2019s media regulator Ofcom, which has launched numerous probes of RT activities, found that the Russian channel has failed to comply with Britain\u2019s broadcasting rules, which could result in fines and ultimately revocation of its broadcast license.\n\nThe European Parliament adopted in November 2016 a comprehensive resolution laying out the European Union\u2019s \u201cstrategy to counteract propaganda\u201d by Russia aimed at the EU. The EU concludes that media such as Sputnik and RT pose a threat to European unity.\n\nThe U.S. branch of the Russian international broadcasting conglomerate RT was forced by the U.S. Department of Justice to register as a foreign agent under the U.S. Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA) on November 10, 2018. Sputnik also subsequently registered as a foreign agent. The activities of RT and Sputnik are a major part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections in the US.\n\nNotably, in December 2008, the Russian government designated ANO \"TV-Novosti,\" the umbrella organization for RT, and MIA Rossiya Segodnya, which includes Sputnik and RIA Novosti among others, as its core organizations for strategic defense. Despite Moscow\u2019s persistent attempts to present RT and Sputnik as independent media organizations, government records show that the Russian federal agency controlling ANO \u201cTV Novosti\u201d exercises \u201cfunctions of a state client\u201d under Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cmain directions of the information policy\u201d \u2013 not independent media.", "lang": "en"}
