Okay? We\u2019re going to release them, essentially, in a short period of time. So we release them. And then they\u2019re supposed to come for a court case. We hire more judges \u2014 we\u2019re trying to hire thousands of judges. No other country in the world does it.\u201d\n\n \u2014 Trump, during a roundtable on taxes in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va., April 5, 2018\n\nThe Justice Department did not respond to our request for comment. An administration official emphasized that there\u2019s an effort underway to hire more judges, as Trump said in April. \u201cWith many new judges being sworn in since the president took office, it reinforces the administration\u2019s goals of reducing the massive backlog in the U.S. immigration courts,\u201d the official said.\n\nImmigration judges are not counted toward this total, since they work in the executive branch, inside the Justice Department. But the point is that all the Article III judges, hearing all sorts of federal cases, at all the different levels, only number at 1,300 or so \u2014 not in the thousands. Adding in immigration judges only gets you to 1,630 or so (also not in the thousands).\n\n\u201cI struggle to think of countries that don\u2019t have some kind of adversarial process to determine who is a refugee,\u201d Parker said. \u201cGovernments do have latitude to determine how they\u2019re going to set up the process. Some governments rely on UNHCR to do the refugee status determination process. In the U.S., there are asylum offices who can do a status determination. There are also immigration judges who can make this determination.\u201d\n\n\u201cAsylum seekers here go through a similar process as in other countries \u2014 there is an initial determination of whether the person meets the definition of a refugee and will be granted protection, and the opportunity to contest or appeal that decision,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThis is at heart an adjudicatory process following administrative and case law. Whether before an immigration court or a tribunal, evidence is presented, lawyers may be present. Many Western nations use the equivalent of immigration courts to determine asylum status and whether an immigrant can be deported.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
