The image has been doctored; in the original photo the ticker displays share prices; the doctored image was posted on Twitter by an Indian comedian who clearly said it was not real.\n\nThe posts, for example this one published April 18, 2019, and shared more than 15,000 times since, contain the image showing the Bombay Stock Exchange in Mumbai. Here is the bourse\u2019s website.\n\nAn electronic ticker on the building's exterior appears to display a message in red capital letters that says: \u201cDon\u2019t vote for Modi\u201d.\n\nPrime Minister Modi is running for re-election in India\u2019s national polls which began April 11, 2019. Here is an AFP report about the election.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the false post:\n\nThe post\u2019s caption, translated to English, says: \u201cMumbai\u2019s share market has also written don\u2019t vote for Modi. Zoom in and see for yourself.\u201d\n\nThe same misleading image has been shared elsewhere on Facebook, for example here and here, and on Twitter for example here.\n\nHowever the image has been doctored from an original photograph that appears here on the \u2018about\u2019 page of the Bombay Stock Exchange website.\n\nThe image below compares screenshots of the picture in the misleading post (L) with the original image as it appears on the bourse\u2019s site (R):\n\nThe verified Twitter account of the Bombay Stock Exchange addressed the doctored image in this tweet dated April 19, 2019.\n\nIt says: \u201cA fake morphed photo against a political party using BSE building has been shared by @kunalkamra88.\n\n\u201cBSE is extremely disappointed at unfortunate,unauthorized & illegal use of BSE buildg fr nefarious activities.BSE reserves right to take appropriate legal action agnst @kunalkamra88\u201d.\n\nThe tweet is embedded below:\n\n@kunalkamra88 is the Twitter handle of Indian stage artist and comedian Kunal Kamra. Here is his verified Twitter account and here is his website.\n\nIn this tweet published April 14, 2019, Kamra shared the doctored image of the bourse alongside other images containing the words \u201cDon\u2019t vote for Modi\u201d.\n\nThe caption made it clear he did not believe the images were real. It said: \"These photos are as real as Modiji\u2019s promises\u2026\u201d\n\nJi is a term used to show respect to elders.", "lang": "en"}
