A TMZ story, citing an unnamed source, said Chauvin was \u201ceffectively\u201d on suicide watch while in Ramsey County.\n\nRegardless, the false w24n.com story about Chauvin racked up nearly 100,000 Facebook engagements, according to CrowdTangle analytics data. It was also spread separately through screenshots of the headline.\n\nThe website is registered to someone in Kenya and describes itself as a \u201cworld leader in online news and information\u201d and claims that it has \u201calmost 200 journalists\u201d around the world, even though there is no staff list on the website.\n\nThe site has previously pushed an unsubstantiated claim that former President Barack Obama tested positive for the novel coronavirus; we\u2019ve seen no evidence to support that assertion. It has also republished content from other outlets without attribution, such as a story about the COVID-19 death toll in Italy that was reported by Reuters and a story taken from TMZ about a tornado in Arkansas.\n\nChauvin, a 44-year-old white police officer, was arrested on May 29 on charges of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin was seen in a viral video kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck, while the 46-year-old black man repeatedly said he could not breathe. Three other officers involved in the May 25 arrest have also been fired.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, Chauvin had his \u201cknee on Mr. Floyd\u2019s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in total. Two minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr. Floyd was non-responsive.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolice are trained that this type of restraint with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous,\u201d the complaint said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
