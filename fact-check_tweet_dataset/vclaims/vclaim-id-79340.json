If it were true that an autopsy indicated that a celebrity of Boseman\u2019s status were potentially murdered, one would expect to see that story reported by most every major news media outlet \u2014 and that was not the case here.\n\nBoseman died on Aug. 28, 2020, after a years-long battle with cancer. According to representatives for the actor, he was initially diagnosed in 2016. His passing at the age of 43 sparked a conversation on building awareness about colon cancer, the disease he suffered from.", "lang": "en"}
