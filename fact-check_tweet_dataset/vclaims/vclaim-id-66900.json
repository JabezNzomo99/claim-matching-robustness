Jeanne Shaheen and Republican challenger Scott Brown heats up, the attacks are growing more intense. In a recent radio ad, Shaheen accused Brown of being too friendly with Wall Street when serving as a senator from neighboring Massachusetts from 2010 to 2012.\n\n\"Wonder why Scott Brown lost re-election in Massachusetts? Well, he was working for Wall Street, not the people. Scott Brown blocked a major financial reform bill until he could water it down and save Wall Street $19 billion. Scott Brown really delivered for Wall Street, said the Boston Globe. Even after the bill passed, news reports show Brown was \u2018secretly serving the interests of Wall Street, working behind the scenes to help the big banks, not consumers.\u2019\n\n\"Wall Street thanked Scott Brown by giving him more campaign contributions than any other candidate -- $5.3 million. Now, Scott Brown wants New Hampshire to send him to Washington. Wall Street\u2019s once again spending millions to help. Scott Brown says he really cares about New Hampshire. Come on, don\u2019t be fooled. No matter where he lives, Scott Brown will always put Wall Street first. And that\u2019s good for Scott Brown, but not New Hampshire.\"\n\nPolitiFact New Hampshire already checked a claim by a pro-Shaheen group that Brown\u2019s actions had saved \"big banks $19 billion in taxes,\" rating it .\n\nBut what about the ad\u2019s claim that \"Wall Street\" gave him \"more campaign contributions than any other candidate -- $5.3 million\"? We decided to take a closer look.\n\nThe Shaheen campaign pointed us to calculations by the Center for Responsive Politics, whose opensecrets.org website tracks a wide variety of campaign-finance data. It\u2019s a trusted source that we\u2019ve used many times in the past.\n\nThe Shaheen campaign\u2019s $5.3 million figure refers to how much Brown received in the 2012 campaign cycle -- when he lost his seat to Democrat Elizabeth Warren -- from donors categorized as being part of the finance, insurance and real estate sector.\n\nTheir -- as is Brown\u2019s No. 1 ranking among all Senate candidates for donations from that sector -- but Shaheen\u2019s ad stretches a bit when it calls this \"Wall Street.\" Most \"finance\" firms have a reasonable claim on being part of Wall Street, but a lot of the insurance and real-estate sectors fall outside that category. Also, not everyone working at these firms is a financial mogul, but their individual donations still count towards the total.\n\nSo we decided to drill down a little deeper.\n\nWe found a few sub-categories of \"finance/insurance/real estate\" that are a closer fit to \"Wall Street.\" They include:\n\u2022 Securities and investment: Brown ranked first among Senate candidates in the 2012 campaign cycle with .\n\u2022 Private equity and investment firms: Brown ranked first with in donations.\n\u2022 Hedge funds: Brown ranked first with in donations.\n\u2022 Venture capital: Brown ranked first with in donations.\n\nThis provides support for the notion that Brown ranked No. 1 in these types of donations. But he ranked a little lower in two other categories:\n\u2022 Finance and credit companies: Brown ranked ninth with in donations.\n\u2022 Commercial banks: Brown ranked third with in donations.\n\nMeanwhile, Brown\u2019s total haul from these six categories was about $4.2 million, or about one-fifth lower than what the ad said.\n\nThis is not the first time that Shaheen\u2019s campaign has used somewhat loose language in describing Brown\u2019s donors. When a previous Shaheen ad claimed that \"Big Oil gave Scott Brown $454,260,\" we rated that claim , noting that only about 11.5 percent of Brown\u2019s haul came from companies and individuals affiliated with the biggest multinational companies -- what most viewers would consider \"Big Oil.\"\n\nWhen we contacted Brown\u2019s staff, spokeswoman Elizabeth Guyton said, \"Scott Brown\u2019s fundraising is no different than Jeanne Shaheen\u2019s in that they both accept contributions from the financial services industry. The only difference is that Jeanne Shaheen is hypocritically attacking him for it.\"\n\nHowever, in the 2012 election cycle -- when Brown was receiving $5.3 million from the finance/insurance/real estate sector -- Shaheen accepted just $64,139 from the same sector, ranking 65th among all Senate candidates. In the current cycle, she has accepted $565,935 from the finance/insurance/real estate sector, ranking her 21st among Senate candidates.\n\nShaheen\u2019s ad said that in 2012, \"Wall Street\" gave Scott Brown \"more campaign contributions than any other candidate -- $5.3 million.\"\n\nIf you put together six categories that might reasonably be considered \"Wall Street,\" Brown received about $4.2 million in all, and he finished first among Senate candidates in four of those six categories. However, the total amount is short of the $5.3 million claimed in the ad.\n\nThe statement is generally accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
