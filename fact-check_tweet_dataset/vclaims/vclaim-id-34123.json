Here is how the candidates\u2019 remarks stacked up against the truth.\n\nRepresentative Tulsi Gabbard was misleading about statements by Mayor Pete Buttigieg on sending troops to Mexico. Ms. Gabbard: \u201cI think the most recent example of your inexperience in national security and foreign policy came from your recent careless statement about how you as president would be willing to send our troops to Mexico to fight the cartels.\u201d Mr. Buttigieg was right. At a Democratic forum this week in Los Angeles, Mr. Buttigieg was asked about President Trump\u2019s recent suggestions that the United States help Mexico wage \u201cwar\u201d on the cartels and whether he envisioned a situation in which American troops would be stationed in Mexico \u201cif Mexico welcomed it.\u201d\n\nIn his response, Mr. Buttigieg emphasized that Mr. Trump\u2019s approach violated Mexican sovereignty and the need for Mexican cooperation and approval in any military response. \u201cThere is a scenario where we could have security cooperation as we do with countries around the world,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said. \u201cNow, I would only order American troops into conflict if there were no other choice, if American lives were on the line and if this was necessary to meet treaty obligations. But we could absolutely be in some kind of partnership role, if and only if it welcomed by our partner south of the border.\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren claimed that her 2 percent wealth tax on households worth more than $50 million would pay for a sweeping expansion of the nation\u2019s social safety net, providing free child care and college tuition. \u201cWe can put $800 billion new federal dollars into all of our public schools. We can make college tuition-free for every kid. We can put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities. And we can cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of the folks who have got it.\u201d The revenue that Ms. Warren would raise from her tax proposal is a subject of intense debate and it is not clear that her wealth tax could pay for the plans she listed. According to a New York Times analysis, the total cost of Ms. Warren\u2019s plans for universal child care, increased spending on public schools, student debt cancellation and free college would be about $2.9 trillion over a decade. The two Berkeley economists advising her campaign, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, estimate that her wealth tax would generate $2.75 trillion over that period of time. If that is correct, then Ms. Warren would be close to being able to pay for those proposals. (Ms. Warren has recently revised her wealth tax proposal, and Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman have refined their calculations but the general conclusions are the same.) But other economists disagree, arguing that a wealth tax would spur waves of new loopholes and tax evasion efforts. Lawrence H. Summers, a Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, and Natasha Sarin, a law and finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania, estimated that Ms. Warren\u2019s wealth tax would raise just 40 percent of what her campaign claims.\n\nFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. exaggerated in saying that \u201cMedicare for all\u201d was a policy without sufficiently broad support among Democrats. \u201cThe fact is that right now the vast majority of Democrats do not support \u2018Medicare for all.\u2019 It couldn\u2019t pass the United States Senate right now with Democrats. It couldn\u2019t pass the House.\u201d This is exaggerated. Depending on how you measure, a majority of Democratic voters do support Medicare for all. Support among Democrats in Congress is weaker than that, but it is hard to find any measure that shows a vast majority who oppose the policy. Public polling shows that a majority of Americans favor Medicare for all when they are asked about it. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey published Wednesday found that 53 percent of adults approve of the idea \u2014 including more than 75 percent of Democrats. Among elected officials, support is softer. Mr. Biden is correct that a Medicare for all bill would be unlikely to pass in the current House, despite Democratic control. A Medicare for all bill sponsored by Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington has more than 116 sponsors out of 233 Democrats currently serving in the House, almost half the party but far short of the votes necessary to pass the legislation. In the Senate, support is a bit weaker: 15 of 45 senators who caucus with the party support Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s Medicare for all bill. Andrew Yang noted that the United States was one of only two countries that do not provide universal paid maternal leave. There are a few more, but none among peer nations. \u201cThere are only two countries in the world that don\u2019t have paid family leave for new moms. The United States of America and Papua New Guinea. That is the entire list, and we need to get off this list as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nMostly true. Mr. Yang likely got this line from a report of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which has examined parental leave policies in 120 countries. Of that group, the United States and Papua New Guinea are the only countries without paid leave policies. But worldwide, there are a few other small countries on the list, including Tonga and Suriname, according to the World Policy Center, which tracks leave policies in more nations. If the details aren\u2019t quite right, Mr. Yang\u2019s larger point stands. The United States is unique among large advanced nations in not requiring any paid leave to new mothers. Mr. Buttigieg was misleading about a case involving the president and nonprofit groups. \u201cThe president had to confess in writing, in court, to illegally diverting charitable contributions that were supposed to go to veterans.\u201d This is misleading. In early November, Mr. Trump was ordered by a New York State judge to pay $2 million in damages to nonprofit groups after he was found to have violated a law by using the now-defunct Donald J. Trump Foundation as an extension of his campaign. Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s suggestion that the funds did not reach veterans groups, however, is wrong. The foundation raised $2.8 million for veterans\u2019 groups during an event in Iowa in January 2016, but allowed the Trump campaign to disburse those funds. Mr. Trump admitted that this was a campaign event, though the foundation, as a charity, was prohibited from supporting candidates for political office. Justice Saliann Scarpulla, of the State Supreme Court in Manhattan, noted in the ruling that \u201cthe funds did ultimately reach their intended destinations, i.e., charitable organizations supporting veterans\u201d but that the foundation\u2019s officers, including Mr. Trump, breached their fiduciary responsibilities to the charity.\n\nThis is exaggerated. When asked in surveys, a majority of Americans say they support some abortion rights. And many Americans support continuing funding for Planned Parenthood, the national network of women\u2019s health providers that includes many abortion clinics. But Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s numbers are a bit higher than those in most polls that ask such questions. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey in May asked about a Trump administration policy that prevents Planned Parenthood from receiving funding for family planning services. In that survey, 69 percent of adults said that they support continued funding for Planned Parenthood, not 90 percent. In that same survey, 65 percent said they would oppose a Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that establishes a constitutional right to abortion. It is possible to find a survey in line with Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s number, but with some caveats. A survey in June from NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll found more than 70 percent of respondents in support of Roe, but that group included people who said they want to \u201ckeep Roe v. Wade but add more restrictions.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
