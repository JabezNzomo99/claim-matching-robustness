Founder of fake news website Postcard News Mahesh Vikram Hegde tweeted the video writing, \u201cAfter winning elections, Muslim parties demanding to declare Belgium as Islamic country. Huge protests have already started. This is what going to happen soon in india also. All the best to my beloved so called \u201cSECULAR\u201d brothers and sisters.\u201d\n\nIn the news clip, RT anchor can be heard saying, \u201cA Muslim party in Belgium says it is preparing to campaign for setting up an Islamic state there. Two candidates from the newly-established Islam party won seats in recent municipal elections.\u201d Subsequently in the show, a Belgian Euro MP says, \u201cIt\u2019s very worrying to see what\u2019s happening now. We see people from Islamic backgrounds forming their own political parties and demanding the introduction of Sharia law and Islamic state in Belgium.\u201d\n\nThe video has also been tweeted by several other handles, including @AjitKDoval_FANand one Vinay Kabadi with mere 55 followers on Twitter, among them the office of railway minister Piyush Goyal.\n\nA user @KalpanaSubrama5, followed by PM Modi, had tweeted the video in April.\n\nThe claim has been widely circulating on Facebook since March.\n\nThe news ticker on the bottom of the broadcast reads, \u201cDeadly superstorm Sandy forces Obama and Romeny to suspend election campaigns.\u201d\n\nSuperstorm Sandy or Hurricane Sandy devastated the United States, Canada and neighbouring regions in 2012. More than 200 people had lost their lives. The news ticker talks about the suspension of election campaignings by presidential candidates Barack Obama and Mitt Romney due to the calamity.\n\nThe RT video was uploaded on YouTube On October 30, 2012.\n\nA newly-established \u2018Islam Party\u2019 in 2012 had won two seats in the municipal elections in Belgium and vowed to implement Sharia law, according to a 2012 report by RT. The party had won two seats in the capital Brussels \u2013 Molenbeek and Anderlecht.\n\nHowever, it lost both the seats in 2018.\n\nSocial media claims are thus false. A 2012 news clip about Islam party campaigning for local elections was shared with the false claim that Muslim parties are now seeking to establish an Islamic state in the country after recent elections.", "lang": "en"}
