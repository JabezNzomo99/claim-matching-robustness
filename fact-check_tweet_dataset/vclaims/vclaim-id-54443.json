(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe new coronavirus was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and we\u2019ve already debunked claims implying Obama funded the creation of COVID-19 in a lab there.\n\nBut the photo in this Facebook post was taken in 2014 in Bethesda, Md., outside Washington, not China.\n\nObama, then president, was visiting the campus of the National Institutes of Health \"to see first-hand the progress that biomedical research is making against Ebola virus disease,\" according to a blog post by Francis Collins, the agency\u2019s director. In the photo, Obama can be seen talking with Nancy Sullivan, chief of the biodefense research section of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nFauci, director of that institute, is standing behind them alongside Sylvia Burwell, then the Health and Human Services secretary, not philanthropist Melinda Gates.\n\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
