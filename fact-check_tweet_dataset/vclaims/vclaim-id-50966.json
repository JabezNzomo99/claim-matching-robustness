(Taal Volcano has already drawn in water from the Oriental Mindoro sea, which could trigger a stronger eruption.)\" It was posted on January 13.\n\nThe page also claimed that the eruption on January 12 was \"just a warning,\" and that the next eruption might be stronger because of the volcano's supposed drawing in of water from Oriental Mindoro, as well as the continuous thunder and lightning activities caused by the eruption.\n\nAs of writing, the post was shared 512 times with 400 reactions and 47 comments. A reader sent the post to Rappler for verification.\n\nThe facts: The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said it is \u201calmost unlikely\u201d for Taal Volcano to draw in water from the seas of Oriental Mindoro because the two bodies of water are not connected.\n\n\u201cKung magkakaroon ng low tide [sa Mindoro], most likely hindi about sa Taal (If a low tide occurs [in Mindoro], it is most likely not connected to Taal),\u201d Lincoln Olayta, research specialist I from Phivolcs, told Rappler via phone interview.\n\nOriental Mindoro is surrounded by West Philippine Sea and Sulu Sea, while the lake surrounding Taal Volcano is contained and does not flow out. Rock fragments and other volcanic debris from the 1754 eruption are lodged in the Pansipit River, blocking the lake's only channel to Balayan Bay, which is connected to the West Philippine Sea.\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
