In the tweet, it is mentioned that former Chinese military official and son of a leader in the Chinese Communist Party, Jianli Yang has claimed that more than 100 Chinese soldiers were killed in a faceoff with India on \u201815 June 2020\u2019 at Galwan valley. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Former Chinese military official, Jianli Yang claimed that more than 100 Chinese soldiers were killed in a faceoff with India on \u201815 June 2020\u2019 at Galwan valley. Fact: Jianli Yang is not a former Chinese military official, and he hasn\u2019t claimed that more than 100 Chinese soldiers were killed in the Galwan valley clashes. Moreover, the tweet is not from the official Twitter account of \u2018Tsai Ing-Wen\u2019. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nThe tweet in the screenshot was from the account with the name \u2018Tsai Ing-Wen\u2019 and Twitter handle starting with \u2018@tsaiin..\u2019. With this information, when we searched on Twitter, the account (\u2018@tsaiing_wen\u2019) was found and it had the same tweet as seen in the screenshot. But the official Twitter handle of \u2018Tsai Ing-Wen\u2019, President of the Republic of China (Taiwan) is \u2018@iingwen\u2019 and has a verified symbol to the account. So, the tweet was not from the official Twitter account of \u2018Tsai Ing-Wen\u2019, President of the Republic of China (Taiwan).\n\nWhen we looked if Jianli Yang had claimed that more than 100 Chinese soldiers were killed in a faceoff with India at Galwan valley on \u201815 June 2020\u2019, no news reports corroborating the same were found. But, in an article written by Jianli Yang for \u2018The Washington Times\u2019, he wrote that the Communist Party of China has not provided details of the Chinese soldiers killed in the Galwan incident, but the Indian government has paid a solid tribute to its soldiers. In that article, Jianli Yang did not claim anything about 100 Chinese soldiers being killed in a faceoff with India at Galwan valley. Neither did he post about it on his Twitter account.\n\nMoreover, Jianli Yang is not a former military officer of China as stated in the post. He is a dissident of Chinese communism; he works to bring democracy in China and lives in America. More information about him can be read here.\n\nTo sum it up, the news that Jianli Yang has claimed that more than 100 Chinese soldiers were killed in the Galwan incident is fake.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
