We\u2019ve written about this before.\n\nThe problem is that failing to adjust for inflation (the rise in how much things cost over time) can give a misleading impression of how these statistics reflect people\u2019s lives.\n\nIf you want a more meaningful idea of how wages are changing, you need to take into account how prices are changing at the same time. What you take home from work is only as useful as what it will buy you.\n\nThat means it\u2019s more helpful to look at what has happened to pay in \u201creal terms\u201d\u2014meaning the numbers have been adjusted to account for inflation.\n\nIn real terms, average weekly pay for employees in Great Britain grew 1.9% in the year to May 2019.\n\nWhile this is relatively high compared to much of the last decade, wages were growing faster for periods in 2015 and 2016, and briefly in 2010.", "lang": "en"}
