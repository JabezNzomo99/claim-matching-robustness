Multiple comments on the page congratulate the poster on the photo manipulation, and one commenter asks for a link to the original photograph, to which the poster replies that they can\u2019t find it anymore.

Domestic production flourished until after the Civil War, when imports and other domestic materials replaced hemp for many purposes. In the late 19th century, marijuana became a popular ingredient in many medicinal products and was sold openly in public pharmacies.\"\n\nNevertheless, this photo does not appear to be authentic.
