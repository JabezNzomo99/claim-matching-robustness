Unsurprisingly, during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic of early 2020, a popular social media post displayed covers of Time magazine issues bearing prominent warnings about global warming and pandemic \u2014 from 2006 and 2017, respectively:\n\nThese images of Time covers are real and correctly dated. The first, from the April 3, 2006, issue, bore headline banners about a \u201cSPECIAL REPORT: GLOBAL WARMING\u201d which implored us to \u201cBE WORRIED. BE VERY WORRIED\u201d:\n\nPolar Ice Caps Are Melting Faster Than Ever \u2026 More And More Land Is Being Devastated By Drought \u2026 Rising Waters Are Drowning Low-Lying Communities \u2026 The climate is crashing, and global warming is to blame. Why the crisis hit so soon \u2014 and what we can do about it Global warming is already disrupting the biological world, pushing many species to the brink of extinction and turning others into runaway pests. But the worst is yet to come.\n\nThe second cover, from the May 15, 2017, issue, featured a large box proclaiming \u201cWARNING: WE ARE NOT READY FOR THE NEXT PANDEMIC\u201d advertising a feature story on the subject of \u201cThe World Is Not Ready for the Next Pandemic\u201d which opened as follows:\n\nOn a hyperconnected planet rife with hyperinfectious diseases, experts warn we aren\u2019t ready to keep America \u2014 and the world \u2014 safe from the next pandemic Across China, the virus that could spark the next pandemic is already circulating. It\u2019s a bird flu called H7N9, and true to its name, it mostly infects poultry. Lately, however, it\u2019s started jumping from chickens to humans more readily \u2014 bad news, because the virus is a killer. During a recent spike, 88% of people infected got pneumonia, three-quarters ended up in intensive care with severe respiratory problems, and 41% died. What H7N9 can\u2019t do \u2014 yet \u2014 is spread easily from person to person, but experts know that could change. The longer the virus spends in humans, the better the chance that it might mutate to become more contagious\u2013and once that happens, it\u2019s only a matter of time before it hops a plane out of China and onto foreign soil, where it could spread through the air like wildfire.\n\nNeither of these warnings was particularly new or revelatory, however. A 2018 \u201cHistorical Overview of Climate Change Science\u201d report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change, noted that \u201cThe realisation that Earth\u2019s climate might be sensitive to the atmospheric concentrations of gases that create a greenhouse effect is more than a century old.\u201d And increases in temperature correlated with increases in CO concentrations have been measured and noted at least as far back as 1938.\n\nLikewise, occurrences of plagues and pandemics have been charted across many centuries of human history, and we have been aware for a long time that bacteria and viruses that cause diseases in other animal species are capable of evolving to infect humans.\n\nUnfortunately, something that has also existed across the course of human history is our reluctance to bear the costs of preparing ourselves for dangers that we know are real but aren\u2019t more predictable in timing than \u201csome day.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
