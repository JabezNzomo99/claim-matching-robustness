This is false: Bombardier has confirmed that the deal will still be honoured, and no evidence suggests that the government of Canada committed any money towards the purchase.\n\n\u201cCanada cancels funding of the planned UGANDA AIRLINES worth $180m over state brutality,\u201d according to a Facebook post by an impostor version of private Ugandan media NBS television.\n\nBombardier Head of Communications Nathalie Siphengphet told AFP that \u201cthe order (for the planes) was not cancelled\u201d, adding that Bombardier was \u201centhusiastic about delivering the planes in due course.\u201d Bombardier did not disclose to AFP how and when payment for the planes would be made.\n\nThe Canadian government could not have withdrawn funding for the plan because no evidence suggests that it committed any public funding to Uganda for the purchase of the planes in the first place. Export and Development Canada (EDC), a Canadian export credit agency -- a governmental loan agency aimed at encouraging the purchase of Canadian products -- would have been the most likely source of public money for such a deal.\n\nYet Shelley MacLean, the EDC spokesperson, told AFP that \u201cEDC was approached for financing support, but is not participating in the transaction.\u201d\n\nThe Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC), an organization like EDC, and Global Affairs Canada, the Canadian government branch in charge of foreign aid, both confirmed to AFP that they did not commit any funds for the deal either.\n\n\u201cThat is hogwash,\u201d General Edward Katumba Wamala, the Ugandan Minister of State for Works, whose ministry oversees the Ugandan National Airlines Company, told local AFP journalist Grace Matsiko about claims of withdrawn funding. Wamala did not disclose the source of funding for the planes to AFP.\n\nNBS television, the media company impersonated, also released a statement warning their audience about the spread of the false information.\n\nAlthough the most-widely shared version of this false post did not provide any more information, a less popular article published on September 11 provided more context.\n\nAccording to the article on Mulengera Media, Canada withdrew funding for the four aircrafts because Canadian lawyer Robert Amsterdam called on the international community to end funding to Uganda in order to compel Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni to improve his human rights record.\n\nAmsterdam is the lawyer of Ugandan musician and opposition MP Bobi Wine, who is currently seeking medical treatment in the United States after being allegedly tortured while under arrest in Uganda.\n\nAt a press conference in Washington on September 6, Amsterdam told reporters that his client and he would \u201ccontact major investors in Uganda (...) to ask them to intervene,\u201d before adding: \u201cWe are not seeking disinvestment from Uganda, what we\u2019re seeking is responsible investment in Uganda.\u201d\n\n* Note: This article was written with the contribution of Grace Matsiko, local AFP journalist in Uganda", "lang": "en"}
