Schumer (D-N.Y.) gets his history wrong.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2019-04-05T07:00:00.641Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-86240", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/04/05/schumers-claim-that-blue-slips-were-longstanding-requirement-judicial-nominees/", "vclaim": "Essentially it works like this: Once the president submits a judicial nomination to the Senate, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee sends a blue-colored form (or \u201cblue slip\u201d) to both senators from the nominee\u2019s home state. Those senators have the option of returning the blue slip with a positive or negative response; they may also choose to withhold the blue slip. A positive response means \u201call good\u201d and a negative or withheld blue slip means there\u2019s an objection.\n\nThe most recent Democratic chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (Vt.), had a policy that no judicial nominee could get a hearing if a home-state senator withheld a blue slip or sent it back negative. This could kill a nomination, because the full Senate does not vote on nominees unless they\u2019ve been approved by the Judiciary Committee. Leahy was chairman from 2001 to 2003 and from 2007 to 2015.\n\nBut his successor, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), late in 2017 said he would start holding hearings for circuit court nominees even if a positive blue slip had not been returned. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R.-S.C.), the current chairman, said negative blue slips would not affect President Trump\u2019s circuit-court nominations but \u201cwhen it comes to district court judges, nobody is going forward unless we get consent from senators from that state.\u201d\n\nAccording to a 2017 report from the Congressional Research Service (CRS), the blue slip surfaced more than 100 years ago, in 1917, but different chairmen of the Judiciary Committee have had different blue-slip policies. Not all of them used the same framework as Leahy.\n\nThat changed in 1956, when Sen. James Eastland, a Mississippi Democrat, took over as chairman of the Judiciary Committee and required two positive blue slips for all judicial nominees. Eastland ran the committee for nearly two decades, from 1956 to 1978. \u201cThe policy was that if a Senator either returned a negative blue slip or failed to return one at all, the committee would stop all action on a nominee,\u201d said an earlier CRS report on blue slips.\n\nEastland was a strict segregationist who fiercely opposed civil rights laws and who, according to former Lyndon Johnson aide Joseph A. Califano Jr., demanded that presidents nominate segregationist federal judges in their states. Eastland apparently never explained why he instituted a strict blue-slip policy. But in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s 1954 ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, which left the pace of integration in the hands of district courts, opponents of civil rights now had a tool to slow progress down.\n\n\u201cPro-Segregation southern senators, of whom Eastland was one, wanted to ensure desegregationist judges were not confirmed to federal judgeships in their states,\u201d said a 2009 paper by Ohio State University researchers presented at a political science conference. \u201cSenators from other parts of the country could not afford politically to vote against a nominee just because he was not a segregationist. Hence, the only way southern senators could defeat a nominee was at the committee level.\u201d\n\nBut Eastland and Leahy appear to be the only two chairmen who have required two positive blue slips, according to the CRS report. No Republicans, and no other Democrats, have followed suit. We won\u2019t bog you down with the details but most chairmen allowed consideration of nominees with a negative or unreturned blue slip, though they gave some weight to a senator\u2019s opposition to a nominee.\n\nSchumer\u2019s office acknowledged that \u201clong-standing requirement\u201d in the article should have been written as \u201cpractice\u201d or \u201ctradition.\u201d But the office argued that the Republican majority has smashed through that tradition by allowing consideration of judges for circuit courts even though they had received negative blue slips from both home state senators. \u201cThe decision of the Republican majority to not honor the blue slips tradition/principle is a clear decline in the Senate\u2019s traditional respect for minority rights,\u201d a statement from the office said.\n\nSchumer goes too far to describe the \u201cblue-slip\u201d practice as a \u201clong-standing requirement\u201d that goes back \u201cgenerations.\u201d In the past 100 years, a strict blue-slip policy existed for just 32 years, under two different committee chairmen. The 17 other chairmen in that period had their own rules. It\u2019s especially interesting that the most extreme version of the blue slip rule appears to have segregationist roots.\n\nSchumer\u2019s staff now says that \u201crequirement\u201d should have been written as \u201ctradition\u201d or \u201cpractice.\u201d This was a written article that presumably was the subject of scrutiny before it was published. So this cannot be considered a slip of the tongue, especially since \u201crequirement\u201d was used twice.\n\nWe had previously fact-checked a different statement on this issue by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, awarding Two Pinocchios. We considered whether Schumer\u2019s language about a \u201crequirement\u201d should merit a Three but will keep it at Two, given that at the circuit level, two negative blue slips are no longer a bar to consideration.", "lang": "en"}
