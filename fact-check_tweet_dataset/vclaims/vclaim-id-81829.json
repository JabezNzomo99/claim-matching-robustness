In a patriotic holiday email, the 1st Congressional District Republican emphasized New Hampshire\u2019s role in the Revolutionary War.\n\n\"The colonies, with a lot of help from Granite State shipbuilders, who built the first ship that sailed into battle under a new American flag, won the Revolutionary War, created what is now the world's oldest constitutional democracy, and charted a course to freedom and prosperity,\" he wrote.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to be proud of in there. But we were intrigued by the piece that we\u2019d never heard before: New Hampshire shipbuilders made the ship that debuted a new American flag in battle.\n\nTo show our American spirit, PolitiFact N.H. turned to the history books to get to the bottom of this claim.\n\nGuinta\u2019s communications director, Brendan Thomas, said it was the USS Raleigh \u2013 built at the site of the current-day Portsmouth Naval Shipyard \u2013 that first sailed into battle flying a new variant of the American flag.\n\nThomas noted that the state celebrates this information in its online history of the state seal, which features the Raleigh. Without further explanation, that the Raleigh was \"the first to carry the American flag into sea battle.\"\n\nThe ship launched in 1776, at a time when the country had no official flag, and sailed until 1778, after Congress defined the first variant of today\u2019s Stars and Stripes. Thomas couldn\u2019t say exactly which variant it was that the Raleigh premiered, except that it was \"not necessarily the Stars and Stripes\" and \"may have been a Union Jack surrounded by stars and stripes.\"\n\nThat design \u2013 a Union Jack in the upper left with the rest filled out by alternating red and white stripes \u2013 is considered to be the first American flag, although unofficially, according to . It went by many names, including the Continental Colors and the Grand Union Flag.\n\nThe Raleigh wasn\u2019t the first to fly the Continental Colors, according to national historical records.\n\nThat flag was first flown Dec. 3, 1775, on the USS Alfred by Navy Lieutenant John Paul Jones, according to . Guinta was talking about the first ship that sailed into battle under a new flag, however, not just the flag being hoisted in the harbor, so Jones\u2019s story doesn\u2019t fit the bill.\n\nStill, an armada led by Commodore Esek Hopkins \u2013 including the Alfred, Columbus, Cabot and Andrew Doria \u2013 marked the first overseas victory for an American flag-flying ship, again before the Raleigh launched, according to Leepson\u2019s book. That armada set sail Jan. 4, 1776, flying the Continental Colors, and captured forts Montagu and Nassau on the eastern end of New Providence in the British-owned Bahamas on March 17, 1776.\n\nThe Raleigh first launched two months later on May 21, 1776, according to the U.S. Navy . So before the Raleigh ever took to the sea, the Continental Colors were already successful in a naval battle.\n\nIf the Raleigh didn\u2019t premier the Continental Colors, it could have been the first to go into battle flying an early version of the Stars and Stripes.\n\nThe Continental Colors, according to Leepson\u2019s book, remained the colonies\u2019 unofficial flag until June 14, 1777. That\u2019s when the Second Continental Congress passed the Flag Act of 1777, setting the stage for the first variant of the Stars and Stripes.\n\nAccording to Leepson\u2019s book, the first ship flying the Stars and Stripes that was victorious over a foreign force was the USS Providence on Jan. 27, 1778. It captured the British Fort Nassau, seized ammunition and freed more than two dozen American prisoners.\n\nThere\u2019s a small window for Guinta\u2019s claim to be true, if the Raleigh had sailed into battle \u2013 one that didn\u2019t merit Leepson\u2019s distinction of the first victory \u2013 between June of 1777 and the following January.\n\nThe Raleigh did sail across the Atlantic Ocean alongside the Alfred during that time, getting into a few scuffles with British ships along the way, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command. But there\u2019s no record of what flags the ships were flying.\n\nThe only mention of the Raleigh\u2019s flag was on a subsequent voyage that ended in the ship\u2019s capture on Sept. 27, 1778. A midshipman on the Raleigh \"struck the Continental colors\" to end a battle in Maine\u2019s Penobscot Bay, meaning he lowered the ship\u2019s flag in an indication of surrender, according to the U.S. Navy\u2019s history. Notably, it was the Continental Colors \u2013 not the Stars and Stripes \u2013 that the Raleigh was flying before it was taken and adopted into the British fleet. And that\u2019s after the USS Providence\u2019s victory in the Bahamas in January.\n\nPolitiFact N.H. asked U.S. Navy Commander Chris Rentfrow, a professor at the U.S. Naval Academy, for his take on the claim.\n\nHe wrote in an email that he\u2019s not aware of any evidence supporting the USS Raleigh being the first to fly the American flag. He said the honor of first flying the Continental Colors goes to the Alfred.\n\n\"Raleigh certainly would have flown this flag (the Continental Colors), as she was a contemporary of Hopkins' Alfred,\" Rentfrow wrote. \"The \u2018Stars and Stripes,\u2019 as you probably know, came about in 1777. Did Raleigh fly it? Probably. She was in service until captured by the British in 1778. I'm not aware that she was \u2018first\u2019 to fly it. We teach our students that the first foreign acknowledgement of the Stars and Stripes was when John Paul Jones' ship Ranger was saluted by the French in 1778.\"\n\nPortsmouth shipbuilders were responsible for many prominent early vessels \u2013 including the Ranger and the Raleigh \u2013 \"thanks in large part to the lobbying and persistence of John Langdon,\" a famed New Hampshire governor and founder, said state archivist Brian Burford. He referenced the writing of New Hampshire maritime historian Richard Winslow, who wrote in 1988 a history of Portsmouth shipbuilding between 1775 and 1815, but was unable to confirm the claim Guinta made.\n\nThe French salute of the Stars and Stripes aboard the Ranger, however, may be something of a consolation prize for Granite Staters, because it, too, was built in Portsmouth.\n\nNeither Burford, the state archivist, nor Malia Ebel, a reference librarian and archivist for the New Hampshire Historical Society, could give a certain answer about Guinta\u2019s claim.\n\nEbel said it\u2019s possible that the Raleigh flew an early variant of the Stars and Stripes, but \"there\u2019s sort of a dearth of information about this particular flag at this point.\"\n\n\"He\u2019s not necessarily wrong. We just can\u2019t confirm what he said,\" Ebel said.\n\nThe strongest evidence in support of the claim comes from the entry on the state\u2019s website about the state seal , which offers only a vague, passing reference: \"The Raleigh has a checkered career of adversities, while becoming the first to carry the American flag into sea battle.\"\n\nThe website cites as its source a 1981 history written by Leon Anderson, a deceased former Monitor reporter and columnist who became a state legislative historian. Ebel said no more detailed information could be found in the manual that Anderson wrote.\n\n\"Even more unfortunately,\" she said, \"it doesn\u2019t have a citation, so we don\u2019t know where it came from.\"\n\nGuinta said \"Granite State shipbuilders . . . built the first ship that sailed into battle under a new American flag.\"\n\nAlthough the USS Raleigh sailed fewer than two years before it was captured, its service spanned two versions of the American flag. The Raleigh definitely flew an earlier variant of the American Flag, called the Continental Colors, but it wasn\u2019t the first to do so.\n\nExperts said it likely flew the other variant, an early version of the Stars and Stripes, but there\u2019s no evidence that it was the first to do so in battle.\n\nThe gist of Guinta\u2019s claim is true: New Hampshire shipbuilders were critical to the success of the fledgling American Navy. He could have easily pointed to the story of the Portsmouth-built Ranger carrying the first American flag that was ever saluted by a foreign nation.\n\nBut there\u2019s scant evidence to support the idea that the Raleigh was the first to sail into battle flying any variant of the American flag.\n\nOn balance, we rate the claim Half True.", "lang": "en"}
