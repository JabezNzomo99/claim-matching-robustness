The claim is false; the footage actually shows a Swedish engineer, who confirmed with Brazilian media she was the one featured in the video, which she posted on Twitter before it went viral on social media.\n\nThis 16-second video has been viewed nearly two million times since it was posted to Twitter on December 10, 2019.\n\nThe caption of the post states: \"Now I have a machine gun. Ho Ho Ho. Not sure Greta's lefty friends will be pleased though\".\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading tweet:\n\nThe video was also shared here, here, here, here, here and here on Twitter with a similar English-language claim.\n\nThe clip was also circulating on social media alongside similar claims written in other languages, such as here in Spanish on YouTube, and here in Portuguese on Facebook.\n\nSao Paulo-based politician Leticia Aguiar also shared a similar claim on Twitter here: \u201cEven the brat Greta Thunberg shoots.\u201d The tweet has since been deleted.\n\nHowever, the claim is false; the woman shooting a rifle in the video is not Greta Thunberg.\n\nA Google reverse image search with video keyframes extracted with InVID, a digital verification tool, found a slightly longer version of the video posted here by Twitter user Emmy (@eslinge) on December 8, 2019.\n\nThe 18-second video was captioned: \"So anyway, I started blasting\".\n\nA second video posted in the same Twitter thread on the same day was filmed from a different angle, showing a woman in a very similar outfit.\n\nBelow are two screenshots of Emmy\u2019s videos:\n\nIn a message to Estad\u00e3o, a Brazilian newspaper working in collaboration with AFP, Emmy confirmed she is the woman in the video.\n\nEmmy, who asked that her last name not be published, also said the videos were made during a training session and that she was amused by the misidentifications.\n\n\"Apparently we are similar but I am 15 years older,\" she said. \u201cI hope people don't really think that I am her. I don't want to cause Greta any harm, I think she's great.\"\n\nOn LinkedIn, Emmy is listed as an engineer working for a company in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nIn a follow-up tweet to the videos, Emmy wrote: \"People on twitter: 'You look like Greta'\n\n Me: No I do NOT!!!!\"\n\nShe also re-tweeted fact-check reports about her videos, for instance here and here, and joked about becoming a meme in Brazil here.\n\nThe rifle seen in the video in the misleading posts was shown in older photos tweeted by Emmy, such as here on November 16 and here on November 21.\n\nThe November 21 tweet shows the same rifle placed between a cat and a book titled \"How to talk to your cat about gun safety\".\n\nThe Swedish-language caption of the post, which is pinned at the top of her Twitter account, translates to English as: \"I assumed responsibility as the owner of animals and weapons\".\n\n-- Greta: again the centre of attention --\n\nOn December 11, 2019, 16-year-old Thunberg was named TIME's \"Person of the Year\".\n\nThe magazine wrote in a corresponding report here that Thunberg has \"succeeded in creating a global attitudinal shift, transforming millions of vague, middle-of-the-night anxieties into a worldwide movement calling for urgent change.\"\n\nUS President Donald Trump questioned TIME's decision a day later in a December 12 tweet, which states: \u201cSo ridiculous. Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!\u201d\n\nIn response to Trump's tweet, the teen activist updated her Twitter biography to read: \u201cA teenager working on her anger management problem. Currently chilling and watching a good old fashioned movie with a friend,\" the BBC reported here on December 12.\n\nThunberg has changed her Twitter profile several times in the past to reflect criticism from world leaders, such as in September following Trump's sarcastic comments, and in December in response to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's remarks of her being a \"pirralha\" -- a brat in Portuguese.\n\nAfter Thunberg changed her Twitter bio to \u201cPirralha\u201d, the term quickly began trending on Twitter in Brazil.\n\nThunberg has been the target of disinformation and the subject of many false claims around the world, as seen in these AFP fact-check reports.\n\nAFP's reporting on the misleading shooting video was conducted in collaboration with Estad\u00e3o, a Brazilian newspaper, as part of the Comprova framework, the collective reporting project. It can be seen in Portuguese here and in Spanish here.", "lang": "en"}
