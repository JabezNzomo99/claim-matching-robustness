This quote is untrue and originally stems from a satirical site.\n\nExamples of the claim are visible here and here .\n\nThe posts appear to show a screenshot of an article headline containing the fictitious quote accompanied by a photograph of James. In the upper left corner of the image is a logo with the letters \u201cALLODS\u201d. The logo stems from a series of satirical sites including \u201cBustatroll.org\u201d ( bustatroll.org/ ) and \u201cAmerica\u2019s Last Line of Defense\u201d ( americaslastlineofdefense.com/ ). Both sites are clearly marked as containing humorous and satirical content. The main page of America\u2019s Last Line of Defense includes a tagline that says, \u201cIf you believe any of this, you\u2019re kinda dumb.\u201d\n\nAn archived version of the original article can be found bit.ly/3fh0r4l .\n\nBustatroll also published another article alleging that James had collected 3 million signatures to \u201cend the NBA anthem\u201d ( here ). This article was labelled under the categories \u201chot potato, satire, and/or conservative fan fiction.\u201d The byline says \u201cFired Writer\u201d.\n\nOn social media the fictitious quote attributed to James, however, is being taken seriously by some users. Comments posted in response include: \u201cBye don\u2019t let the \u2018door\u2019 hit you\u201d and \u201cIf everyone would just stop watching the games or buying any merchandise from these little boy's I bet there (sic) temper tantrums would stop.\u201d ( here )\n\nIn October 2019, James reportedly stirred controversy during a game against the Los Angeles Clippers by yelling \u201clet\u2019s go\u201d before the national anthem had concluded ( here ).\n\nAt that time, Snopes also debunked this fictitious claim circulating on social media, ( here ).\n\nFalse. LeBron James did not threaten to quit the NBA over the national anthem. This claim stemmed from a satirical article.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
