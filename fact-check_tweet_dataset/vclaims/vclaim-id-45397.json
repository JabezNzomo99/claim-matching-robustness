The doctor advises patients to take paracetamol for fever, zinc tablets, Ivermectin tablets once a day among other things. He goes on to suggest people to not visit a hospital but self treat themselves at home, which could be potentially dangerous. The viral post, which is in Bengali, says that the photos are a doctor\u2019s advice. His first card says, \u201cIf I get corona, what will I do?\u201d An archived version of this post can be seen here. Do Masks Help Prevent COVID-19? Here\u2019s What Experts Have to Say\n\nThe post had 21k shares and 1.5k likes at the time this story was published. Here\u2019s what the doctor recommends in case someone has COVID-19:\n\u2022 Eat healthy food and get as much rest\n\u2022 Take paracetamol for the fever\n\u2022 Take anti histamine such as Flex 120 mg every night\n\u2022 Take Zinc tablet (available as Zorate 60/Zinoret 60)\n\u2022 Drink lots of water. Saline can be mixed with this water as well.\n\u2022 Take Ivermectin 12 mg tablet once a day or Scabo 6 mg two tablets single dose\n\u2022 Take Doxycyclin tablet (Doxicap 100 mg 2 times a day for seven days) The first pertinent question that arises on seeing this post is the identity of this man and whether he is really a doctor. The Quint recognised him from a video that had gone viral in March, and which we found was still being shared on Facebook. An archived version of this post can be seen here. The post, once again in Bengali, claimed that this was Dr Arkaprabha Sinha from AIIMS who was presenting some latest updates about coronavirus. However, we found no existence of any doctor of the same name employed at an AIIMS. Moreover, the language and accent used by the man in the video pointed towards him being from Bangladesh. On running several searches on YouTube, we came across more videos of the same person and found some in which he identifies himself as Dr Zakir. COVID Spreads From Contaminated Surfaces. Here\u2019s How to Avoid It\n\nSearching with this clue, we came across more videos which offered his full name, Dr Zakir Hossain Shobuj. Posted by We Are Selfie on Saturday, March 7, 2020 When we searched on Facebook, we came across a video on his page in which he was wearing green scrubs, which had the initials UAMCH printed on them. We ran a search for this and found that it stood for Uttara Adhunik Medical College Hospital, in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Therefore, it is clear that this man is a doctor from Bangladesh. Notification by Pak Punjab Govt Banning Poultry Over COVID is Fake\n\nLet us now address the advice he has for coronavirus patients. First off, the advice that one should not go to a hospital but should rather isolate at home should have come with a caveat. While doctors have been suggesting that those with mild symptoms and those who are asymptomatic should certainly isolate at home and don\u2019t need to go to a hospital, those with more severe symptoms such as breathlessness, high fever, a persistent cough, extreme exhaustion or oxygen levels below 90, have to go to a hospital. Dr Hossain fails to make this clear in his advice for COVID-19 patients. \u201cIf you have symptoms, you can always go to meet a doctor but you don\u2019t need hospitalisation for mild symptoms. If you have breathlessness, high-grade persistent fever or a cough, you have to see a doctor and if need be, get hospitalised,\u201d Dr Sumit Ray, a critical care specialist in Delhi NCR told The Quint. 1 Crore COVID-19 Patients Given Free Treatment? PM Didn\u2019t Say That\n\nHis advice about doing hot water gargles every hour, taking hot water steam regularly and drinking ginger tea and \u2018colour\u2019 tea (essentially black tea or any kind of tea without milk) while not harmful, have not been proven to be effective either. The Quint has previously debunked these claims, which have been viral for a while. \u201cThe claim that hot water gargles can treat coronavirus is completely wrong and there is no medical basis for such claims.\u201d Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals told The Quint. Dr Ray also rubbished the claim by saying that gargling does not help in any way to cure the novel coronavirus. The claim that tea can help COVID-19 patients is also baseless, as there is no evidence for the same. Dr Neeraj Jain, Internal Medicine, Gangaram Hospital, had earlier told The Quint that, \u201cAt present, there is absolutely no evidence or data to support the claim that tea can cure coronavirus.\u201d Further, in the post, Dr Zakir advises the consumption of foods rich in Vitamin C and D as well as taking zinc tablets. FIT-WebQoof: Has Italy Found the \u2018Remedy\u2019 for COVID-19?\n\nDr Ray says that Vitamin C and D, and zinc have supposedly anti-inflammatory properties but this has not been proven in clinical trials, specially in the COVID setting. However, he also added that while they may not benefit, they would also cause no harm to a COVID-19 patient. He also pointed out that nobody should overdose and people need to know the doses of all of these before taking them. With regard to Dr Zakir\u2019s advice about taking Ivermectin and Doxycyclin, Dr Ray told The Quint that there is no strong evidence to prove that Ivermectin has any effect. For Doxycyclin as well, there is even less evidence than for hydroxychloroquine, he said. Both Ivermectin and Doxycyclin are drugs that can have side-effects and \u201cno body should use these without prescription\u201d. \u201cThese probably can be avoided. There is no reason to give these. The rest, there is no harm,\u201d Dr Ray said, saying that overall, none of the advice given in the post had been proven to be effective. Speaking to The Quint, Dr Suranjan Chatterjee said that none of the things mentioned in the post are wrong because they are modalities of treatment that are being used. But he also stressed the need for medical supervision, to be in touch with a physician or a COVID hospital doctor.", "lang": "en"}
