Also, Guzm\u00e1n didn\u2019t testify.\n\nThe claim was shared on the official Facebook page of country singer and conservative activist Ted Nugent. The post displays an image of Guzm\u00e1n and reads: \"The feds closed the courtroom when El Chapo started naming Democrat\u2019s who he paid off. Imagine that!!\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThis is another variation of many rumors that falsely claim Guzm\u00e1n gave up information during testimony in the trial. We previously fact-checked one that said Guzm\u00e1n stated in court that former FBI director James Comey helped launder $150 million cartel money for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. We rated that Pants on Fire!\n\nAnd like the previous claims, this one ignores the fact that Guzm\u00e1n didn\u2019t take the stand during his trial.\n\nGuzm\u00e1n was found guilty in February 2019 on 10 counts of federal charges and sentenced to life in prison after the trial exposed the inner workings of his Sinaloa cartel, which funneled drugs into the United States for decades.\n\nAccording to the trial\u2019s transcript and several media reports, Guzm\u00e1n chose not to testify at the trial and his defense only called one witness, FBI agent Paul Roberts. The agent was called to discuss notes he took about a drug trafficker previously involved with Guzm\u00e1n, in an attempt to highlight discrepancies.\n\nAlex Cifuentes, a former Guzm\u00e1n associate, took the stand and testified that former Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto took a $100 million bribe from the kingpin. But there was no testimony about any American officials.\n\nA post shared by Ted Nugent claims that federal agents \"closed\" the courtroom when Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n started naming Democrats he paid off.\n\nThis claim is unfounded. The trial was covered by media organizations around the world and federal agents couldn\u2019t have closed off Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s testimony because he never gave one.\n\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
