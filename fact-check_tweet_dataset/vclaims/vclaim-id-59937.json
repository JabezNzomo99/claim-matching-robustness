One is a surgical mask, typically a loose fitting blue mask the likes of which are commonly available.\n\nThe second is a surgical mask with an attached sheet of plastic which acts as a visor to protect the eyes.\n\nThe third is an FFP3 disposable respirator, which looks like a mask but forms a seal with the face, stopping particles from getting in through the sides.\n\nWhat is claimed about the masks?\n\nThe people in the video claim that surgical masks don\u2019t offer any protection for the wearer against the new coronavirus, whereas FFP3 respirators do.\n\nA surgical mask, in theory, will help block large droplets and keep them from reaching your mouth and nose. However it will not filter or block small particles in the air which could contain the Covid-19 virus.\n\nHow that theory applies to the real world is more complicated.\n\nA study in the Lancet found that masks have been shown to protect the wearer against infection, looking primarily at studies in healthcare settings. They are less effective than respirators, and by no means 100% effective at reducing infection, but there is evidence to show they help.\n\nThe evidence on how useful masks are outside of healthcare settings is less consistent but there is some evidence of benefit. For example, a review of studies into mask wearing to control influenza transmission found \u201cno significant effect\u201d. Another (which has not yet been peer-reviewed) found some evidence that there might be a slight protective effect against respiratory infections and a third review of existing studies in both healthcare settings and the community again found \u201cno significant effect\u201d (it has also not yet been peer reviewed).\n\nThese studies typically look at whether masks stop infection outright, which might not tell the whole story. Research suggests that masks could be effective even if they just reduce the number of viral particles that make their way into the wearer\u2019s body, which may result in the wearer having a milder infection or not getting infected at all.\n\nThe evidence on FFP3 respirators is much clearer. FFP3 respirators remove at least 99% of particles when inhaling, and so offer the most protection against Covid-19 infection.\n\nWhile surgical masks are used as personal protective equipment in hospitals, FFP3 respirators are recommended for staff who are dealing with Covid-19 patients and \u201cfor all aerosol generating procedures\u201d due to this level of protection.\n\nMasks may offer the most benefit by protecting others\n\nWhat is clear about the video is that the staff are only considering the value of masks to the wearer. A mask which is deemed not to adequately protect the wearer is dismissed as \u201cno good\u201d.\n\nThey say that people don\u2019t really need to wear surgical masks in public, as is being recommended by various governments including the UK government.\n\nThis is arguably unhelpful, because it ignores the evidence showing that wearing a mask can also help other people, not just yourself.\n\nOne theory as to why masks might be better at protecting others rather than yourself relates to the transmission of Covid-19.\n\nWhen you breathe, cough, sneeze or talk you expel droplets which can evaporate and become smaller \u201cdroplet nuclei\u201d.\n\nTransmission of disease via droplets is known as droplet transmission, and via smaller droplet nuclei is also known as airborne transmission. There is mounting evidence that Covid-19 is spread by airborne transmission as well as droplet transmission.\n\nMasks are better at stopping droplets than droplet nuclei, because droplets are bigger.\n\nSo a mask may not protect you from breathing in an airborne infected droplet nucleus. But, if you yourself are infected, a mask might stop the droplets you sneeze out, before they can turn into droplet nuclei which could infect someone else.", "lang": "en"}
