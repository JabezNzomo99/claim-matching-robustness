Part of the post comes from a 2007 satirical column.\n\nThe viral post claims Obama made negative comments about the national anthem during a \u201cMeet the Press\u201d interview on Sept. 7, 2008. (RELATED: Did Michelle Obama Call Trump The \u2018Dumbest President In US History\u2019 In An Interview With Oprah Winfrey?)\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve said about the flag pin, I don\u2019t want to be perceived as taking sides. There are a lot of people in the world to whom the American flag is a symbol of oppression,\u201d the then-senator is quoted as saying. \u201cThe anthem itself conveys a war-like message. You know, the bombs bursting in air and all that sort of thing.\u201d\n\nThe post further alleges that Obama suggested the national anthem be changed \u201cfor something less parochial and less bellicose\u201d such as the song \u201cI\u2019d Like to Teach the World To Sing.\u201d\n\nHowever, Obama never made any of the comments attributed to him in the Facebook post. They appear on neither his official websites nor his social media pages. The Daily Caller also didn\u2019t find any media reports about him making such comments.\n\nObama didn\u2019t appear on the Sept. 7, 2008, episode of \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d further adding to the post\u2019s dubiousness. Joe Biden, then a senator, and writer Thomas Friedman were the guests, according to the transcript.\n\nSome of the post\u2019s text appears to come from an October 2007 satire article by writer John Semmens. It was published as part of his series \u201cSemi-News \u2013 A Satirical Look at Recent News\u201d and clearly labeled as satire.\n\nThe claim, debunked by Snopes in 2008, previously circulated as a chain email. Later versions of the text have also been falsely attributed to a fictional Washington Post reporter, according to Snopes.", "lang": "en"}
