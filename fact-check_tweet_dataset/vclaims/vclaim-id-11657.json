But accounting for inflation it\u2019s only the fastest for two years.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-11657", "url": "https://fullfact.org/economy/wage-growth-only-fastest-decade-if-you-ignore-inflation/", "vclaim": "Wage growth is only the fastest in a decade if you ignore inflation\n\nHeadlines about the latest data on people\u2019s earnings from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) are focusing on the claim that wages are rising at the fastest pace in a decade. But these ignore something important.\n\nIt\u2019s correct\u2014as you\u2019ll read in several places\u2014that average weekly wages in Great Britain are growing at their fastest rate since 2008, but only if you don\u2019t adjust for inflation. The problem is that failing to adjust for inflation (the rise in how much things cost over time) can give a misleading impression of how these statistics reflect people\u2019s lives.\n\nIf you want a more meaningful idea of how wages are changing, you need to take into account how prices are changing at the same time. What you take home from work is only as useful as what it will buy you.\n\nWe don\u2019t have to look far to see how things look adjusted for inflation (what\u2019s known as \u201creal terms\u201d, as opposed to \u201cnominal\u201d or \u201ccash terms\u201d for the non-adjusted figure), as the ONS says this clearly in their release:\n\nThis means wage growth can look quite different depending on which measure you look at.\n\nYou can see the same effect if you look at \u201ctotal pay\u201d instead of \u201cregular pay\u201d, which includes how much people are paid in bonuses.\n\nWhichever you look at, it\u2019s true that pay packets are growing, and growing at a faster rate than they have in some time. But once you account for inflation, it doesn\u2019t compare yet to the growth in 2015 and 2016, when inflation was low and real terms pay packets were increasing at a faster rate.\n\nThis matters because, as we\u2019ve seen from several recent Prime Minister\u2019s Questions, this is a headline claim used by the government, alongside correct claims about the employment rate being at a record high, and unemployment rates at their lowest in over 40 years.\n\nBut this view on wages simply doesn\u2019t give the best picture of what\u2019s happening to people\u2019s pay.\n\nQuoting the non-adjusted figure isn\u2019t wrong; it is useful to know both the figure before and after adjusting for inflation. But at the very least news reports should say clearly that this is what they\u2019re doing\u2015and give the real terms figure alongside it.", "lang": "en"}
