The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) first issued this design in 2017, according to the RBA website.\n\nThe post alleges that the person is Gates and that the circular illustration is the coronavirus, saying, \u201cWhat\u2019s bill gates and the Corona virus (sic) doing on Australian 10 dollar note. And many will just blow this off.. Wake up, it\u2019s been planned for years.\u201d But that isn\u2019t correct.\n\nPer the RBA website, the person depicted on the banknote is Gilmore, an Australian writer who lived from 1865 to 1962. The RBA explains that the representation is \u201cbased on a 1952 photograph sourced from the Herald and Weekly Times Limited portrait collection, Pictures Collection, State Library of Victoria.\u201d (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Tom Hanks Quarantined In Australia With Wilson The Volleyball?)\n\nThe circular illustration does not represent the coronavirus. Rather, it is the banknote designer\u2019s interpretation of the bramble wattle, a plant native to Australia, according to the RBA website.\n\nAFP Fact Check reported that an RBA spokesperson said the golden bramble wattle is one of the security features on the banknote.", "lang": "en"}
