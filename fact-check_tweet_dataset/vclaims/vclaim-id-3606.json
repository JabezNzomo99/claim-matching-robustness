They could have said, \u2018It was a case of agents stepping out of line, but we will fix it and turn everything into the bounds of the law,\u2019\u201d Putin said.\n\n\u201cNot a word! On the contrary, there was full support of those who committed this coup,\u201d he continued.\u201cThis is what they did with their own hands. How can they not support the current leadership now? They put themselves into a corner.\u201d\n\nIn fact, what occurred in Ukraine in February 2014 was not an armed coup, and there is no credible evidence that protesters were \u201cagents\u201d of the United States or any other country. After government snipers and riot police killed dozens of protesters on February 20, a small minority of protesters acquired rudimentary weapons, including so-called \u201ctraumatic\u201d (non-lethal) pistols, air rifles, and hunting rifles. This can be seen even in the photo RT used for this story: the man in the foreground appears to be armed with an air rifle or small-caliber sporting rifle.\n\nNone of these weapons proved a match for trained police armed with fully automatic Kalashnikovs and a variety of sniper rifles.\n\nIt is also important to remember that only a handful of buildings in the center of Kyiv were ever occupied by protesters, some of which were non-governmental buildings whose owners voluntarily allowed protesters to use their facilities.\n\nThe basis for Putin\u2019s accusation is the February 21 agreement signed between then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and the leaders of the parliamentary opposition parties, whom many saw as leaders of the Maidan protest movement (though this was disputed by many protesters themselves). Putin, like other Russian politicians and media figures, has repeatedly implied that the U.S. somehow exercised control over the protesters, who ignored the agreement and supposedly led an all-out assault to seize power. This is not how events played out.\n\nProtest leaders have said they received phone calls from commanders of individual police units asking for safe passage out of Kyiv, which was granted. In the early morning hours of February 22, Yanukovych left his private residence of Mezhyhirya outside the city by helicopter, bound for Kharkiv in the eastern part of the country. Eyewitnesses said the disappearance of the riot police guarding his residential compound coincided with Yanukovych\u2019s flight, with protesters showing up later. Yanukovych traveled from Kharkiv to his native city of Donetsk, then to the Crimea, and wound up in Russia, where he resides to this day.\n\nRather than being driven from power by a coup, there is evidence suggesting that Viktor Yanukovych was already planning to leave Kyiv before signing the February 21 agreement. Security camera footage shows his staff removing valuables from his Mezhyhirya compound on February 19.\n\nOther security footage shows valuables being removed on February 21, clearly during the day.\n\nThe agreement was signed in the evening, when it was already dark in Kyiv. Based on reports at the time, the Ukranian leader said while in Kharkiv that he had not resigned, but it became clear soon after leaving that his party allies had abandoned him. When he failed to leave on a plane from Donetsk airport, he then left by car and made his way to Crimea and later Russia. (see NYT article linked above) Yanukovych\u2019s plan to leave was in place before riot police began abandoning their positions.\n\nWhat is (and isn\u2019t) a coup\n\nBy definition, a coup d\u2019etat is when members of a country\u2019s political elite, most often military officers, seize power by force. That is not what happened in Kyiv in 2014. The military played virtually no role, and the only military unit mobilized during these events was ordered to come to Kyiv to help suppress the protesters, not help them. Those personnel were blockaded in their barracks and never made it to the capital.\n\nViktor Yanukovych was not removed as the result of machinations of his country\u2019s political or military elite. He provoked protests through his own actions (refusing to sign an EU association agreement he had promised for years and then violently cracking down on protesters), and then planned to flee the capital, apparently hoping he could rebuild his power base outside Kyiv until planned December 2014 elections. Instead, his allies abandoned him, and so he abandoned Ukraine.\n\nLater in the RT article, Putin is quoted on the topic of post-Maidan Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIf they did it a little different, Ukraine would have benefited much more. Our co-operation links would not have been broken. Entire industries in Ukraine would have still existed,\u201d Putin said.\n\nWhat Putin and the RT article neglected to mention is the Russian invasion and annexation of the Crimea and the presence of Russian nationals fighting with separatists of Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region, which lead to the breakdown in Russian-Ukrainian relations.", "lang": "en"}
