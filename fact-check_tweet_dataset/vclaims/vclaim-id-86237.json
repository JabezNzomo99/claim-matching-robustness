And I remember leaving, and I said so she\u2019s got 500 people, and I had 32,000 people including the people outside. So she\u2019s here at prime time 7:30, I\u2019m here at 1 in the morning. She has 500 or 600 people, I have 32,000.\u201d\n\nTrump is being very misleading here. His administration has continually tried to eliminate or reduce funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a program for restoring the ecosystem of the Great Lakes that started under the Obama administration in 2010. Federal funding ranged from nearly $300 million to $450 million a year under Obama. Trump\u2019s 2018 budget request would have zeroed out all funding \u2014 the administration wanted \u201cresponsibility for funding local environmental efforts and programs to state and local entities\u201d \u2014 and his 2020 budget would have cut it by 90 percent. Notwithstanding Trump\u2019s proposed cuts, Congress appropriated nearly $300 million in 2019.\n\nLake Superior is 1,332 feet deep, but it is not even the deepest freshwater lake in the United States. The deepest is Crater Lake, a volcanic crater in southern Oregon, with the deepest measured depth at 1,949 feet. Lake Tahoe and Lake Chelan are also deeper than Lake Superior, so it ranks fourth in the United States. Lake Baikal in southern Russia is the world\u2019s deepest lake. It is an estimated 5,387 feet deep. Lake Baikal is also the world\u2019s largest freshwater lake in terms of volume. Worldwide, Crater Lake ranks ninth, and Lake Superior does not even make the top 20; it is the 37th-deepest lake in the world.\n\nDeductibles vary according to the type of plan people buy. Trump appears to be referring to \u201cBronze plan\u201d deductibles, which are $6,258 when prescription drugs and medical spending are in the deductible; the deductibles for Silver, Gold and Platinum plans are much lower. Silver plans are the most common choice in the marketplace and have equivalent deductibles of $4,375. The Affordable Care Act included subsidies that helped keep premiums low for most people on the exchanges. Trump eliminated cost-sharing reduction payments that compensate insurance companies for offering mandatory discounts on out-of-pocket spending to lower-income customers. Ironically, that led to even bigger premium subsidies as companies increased premiums to make up for the loss of income.\n\nIn reality, the Green New Deal resolution has no teeth and wouldn\u2019t become law if it passed. So these claims are based on a retracted FAQ about a nonbinding resolution. In these documents, proponents of the Green New Deal mused about ending air travel. As problematic as those lines were, none made it into the resolution. High-speed rail would become an airplane alternative for some travelers under the terms of the Green New Deal, but it wouldn\u2019t end commercial air travel. Travelers who prefer flights over high-speed rail would still have a choice. As for cows, Trump is referring to a line in the FAQ intended to be an ironic reference to the effect of cow emissions.\n\nThis statement lacks context. The auto and auto parts manufacturing sectors reached a peak of 1.3 million jobs in June 2000. The number of jobs decreased by more than half, to 623,000, in June 2009, the end of the Great Recession. The number of jobs now tops 1 million, but much of that growth predates Trump. Only about 55,000 auto and auto parts jobs have been created since he took office, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nTrump frequently exaggerates the size of trade deficits \u2014 with Mexico, it was $78 billion in 2018, $69 billion in 2017 and $62 billion in 2016. Countries do not \u201close\u201d money on trade deficits. A trade deficit simply means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country. Trade deficits are also affected by macroeconomic factors, such as currencies, economic growth, and savings and investment rates.\n\nAs for the trade deficit with Mexico before the North American Free Trade Agreement, the United States ran trade deficits in goods (Trump\u2019s preferred metric) with Mexico five out of the 10 years before the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect, according to the Census Bureau. In the years when the United States ran a goods surplus, it was never more than $5 billion and usually about $1 billion to $2 billion. But what matters is not the deficit or surplus but rather the level of trade between the two countries. Cross-border trade in goods was about $100 billion in 1994, compared with more than $500 billion in 2018. According to the Commerce Department, U.S. exports of goods and services to Mexico supported an estimated 1.2 million jobs in 2015 (the latest data available).\n\nTrump says there are 76,000 \u201cillegal immigrants,\u201d but almost 53,000 of the total are family units, unaccompanied children or \u201cinadmissibles\u201d who present themselves at the border seeking asylum. It\u2019s a different situation from that of the mostly single men who tried to cross the border in large numbers in the early 2000s. Under Trump, the Customs and Border Protection agency has been releasing a combined total, but the \u201cinadmissibles\u201d \u2014 who numbered 9,653 in February \u2014 are not part of the apprehensions. Inadmissibles include \u201cindividuals encountered at ports of entry who are seeking lawful admission into the United States but are determined to be inadmissible, individuals presenting themselves to seek humanitarian protection under our laws, and individuals who withdraw an application for admission and return to their countries of origin within a short timeframe.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
