The picture, which the Daily Caller found on the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library website, actually shows the president meeting with \u201cAfghan Freedom Fighters\u201d to discuss \u201cSoviet atrocities in Afghanistan,\u201d according to its caption.\n\nThe men, also referred to as mujahedeen, were Islamic guerrilla fighters who opposed the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan during the 70s and 80s. The Reagan administration provided funds to aid their resistance efforts.\n\nAdding even more to the Facebook post\u2019s dubiousness, the photograph was taken in 1983, according to its caption, so it is impossible for the men who met with Reagan to be Taliban members. The Taliban didn\u2019t emerge until the mid-90s, roughly a decade after the picture was taken.", "lang": "en"}
