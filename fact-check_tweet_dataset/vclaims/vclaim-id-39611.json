The same video was uploaded on YouTube by the \u2018Aaj Tak\u2019 with the description, \u201ca Muslim trader from UP was allegedly slapped by an unidentified person when he refused to raise \u2018Bharat Mata ki Jai\u2019 slogan during a protest by Bajrang Dal activists against the attack on Amarnath pilgrim.\u201d\n\nThe man speaking in the video is Sant Yuvraj, not \u2018BJP MLA Anil Upadhyay\u2019.
