But let\u2019s examine this quote. The phrase \u201cfully above board\u201d has been used in at least three recent interviews.\n\nThe Clinton campaign provided a number of quotes, mainly from spokespeople for the State Department, to support the notion that the use of personal e-mail was \u201cfully above board.\u201d Here\u2019s one from John Kirby on Aug. 25: \u201dIt is not prohibited to use private email. It is discouraged, obviously, and we recognize there are instances when there may be no other choice, as long as the records are being preserved and recorded.\u201d\n\nNote that Kirby said that the practice of using nongovernmental e-mail was discouraged. The big difference for Clinton, of course, was her exclusive use of a private e-mail system for State Department business. This was not an occasional usage when there was no other choice. As we have noted previously, \u201cClinton\u2019s decision to use a private e-mail system for official business was highly unusual and flouted State Department procedures, even if not expressly prohibited by law at the time.\u201d\n\nOur colleagues at FactCheck.org have cited a lengthy statement to the Senate by Jason R. Baron, a lawyer at Drinker Biddle and a former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA): \u201cThe setting up of and maintaining a private email network as the sole means to conduct official business by email, coupled with a failure to timely return email records into government custody, amount to actions plainly inconsistent with the federal record-keeping laws.\u201d\n\nAs for the recording-keeping requirements, Clinton\u2019s lawyer David Kendall has argued that Clinton\u2019s practice of copying and forwarding e-mails to individuals on the State Department system \u2014 combined with her production in 2014 of some e-mails that were not captured \u2014 was how she complied with this provision. (The Foreign Affairs Manual, however, makes it clear that before a senior official, such as a Senate-confirmed presidential appointee, departs government service, he or she must prepare an inventory of personal papers that are proposed for removal.)\n\nBaron, in his statement, said that the fact that an e-mail was sent to or received from a \u201c.gov\u201d address \u201cdoes not automatically ensure\u201d that e-mail would have been archived for preservation in an official recordkeeping system.\n\nClinton\u2019s claim that her system was \u201cfully above board\u201d appears to be a twist on the claim that what she had done was permitted, while also suggesting a degree of openness about the arrangement.\n\nThis brings us to the question of whether \u201ceveryone\u201d knew Clinton was using a private e-mail system. As phrased, Clinton sidesteps the question of whether people knew she was exclusively using a private system. (Even President Obama has said he was unaware that Clinton did State Department business only from a private system.)\n\nStill, \u201ceveryone\u201d is a sweeping phrase. One would presume that people receiving her e-mails would recognize it was from a private account. But at least one e-mail released by the State Department suggests a senior official was out of the loop.\n\nIn a Feb. 27, 2010, e-mail exchange between Clinton and her aide Huma Abedin, it was revealed that a senior official named Judith (possibly Judith McHale, then the undersecretary of state for public diplomacy) had contacted the State Department IT help desk because an e-mail she had sent to Clinton had bounced back. Clinton was wondering why she received an e-mail from a State Department technician asking whether she had received a message.\n\n\u201cWhat happened is Judith sent you an email. It bounced back. She called the email help desk (I guess assuming u had state email) and told them that,\u201d Huma wrote, using email abbreviations. \u201cThey had no idea it was YOU, just some random address so they emailed.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
