Adam Schiff, chair of the House intelligence committee, wrongly implied that his committee had no contact with the whistleblower before receiving the complaint. Schiff claimed, \u201cWe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower,\u201d when the whistleblower had in fact reached out to a committee aide before filing a complaint.\n\nA Democratic committee official told us Schiff \u201ccould have been more clear\u201d but was \u201creferring to the Committee officially interviewing the whistleblower, and himself personally.\u201d It was clearly known, however, that the committee hadn\u2019t officially interviewed the whistleblower at that time.\n\nThe New York Times broke the story on Oct. 2 that Schiff knew about \u201cthe outlines\u201d of the whistleblower\u2019s concerns before the Aug. 12 complaint was filed. The whistleblower had contacted an intelligence committee aide after passing along concerns to the CIA\u2019s top lawyer and being \u201c[c]oncerned about how that initial avenue for airing his allegations through the C.I.A. was unfolding,\u201d the Times reported.\n\nIn an Oct. 2 press conference, President Donald Trump speculated that \u201cI think [Schiff] probably helped write\u201d the complaint, but there\u2019s no evidence of that. Patrick Boland, spokesman for Schiff and the House intelligence committee, said in a statement, \u201cAt no point did the Committee review or receive the complaint in advance.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 9, Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community, sent a letter to the House intelligence committee saying he had received a whistleblower\u2019s complaint relating to an \u201curgent concern,\u201d and that he had sent \u201cmy determination of a credible urgent concern\u201d along with a copy of the complaint to Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. Contrary to \u201cpast practice,\u201d Atkinson said, Maguire hadn\u2019t forwarded the complaint to Congress within seven days of receiving it.\n\nSix days later, Schiff was asked about the complaint in a Sept. 17 MSNBC interview and stated, \u201cWe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower.\u201d\n\nMSNBC contributor Sam Stein: First off, have you heard from the whistleblower? Are you \u2014 do you want to hear from the whistleblower? What protections could you provide to the whistleblower? And then, you also said that the DNI is refusing to turn over the stuff, citing a request from a higher authority \u2014 the insinuation left, at least for me and others, was that the President himself had intervened. Is that the insinuation you sought to provide and, if so, what basis do you have for making that insinuation? Schiff: We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower. We would like to, but I\u2019m sure the whistleblower has concerns that he has not been advised, as the law requires, by the inspector general or the director of national intelligence, just as to how he is to communicate with Congress. And so the risk for the whistleblower is retaliation. Will the whistleblower be protected under the statute if the offices that are supposed to come to his assistance and provide the mechanism are unwilling to do so? But yes, we would love to talk directly with the whistleblower.\n\nStein later asked, \u201cDo we know what the nature of the issue at hand is? \u2026 What can you tell us about the actual substance of the matter? Are you in the dark as well?\u201d\n\nSchiff responded: \u201cWell we don\u2019t have the complaint, so there\u2019s a limit to what I can say about the substance of it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we do know from the Inspector General that the subject matter relates to an intelligence activity, that it is not just a concern but an urgent concern, that it deals with a serious or flagrant abuse, and that\u2019s really all that is necessary to provide that complaint to Congress.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s complaint charges that Trump \u201cis using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election\u201d by, \u201camong other things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the President\u2019s main domestic political rivals.\u201d (For more on the complaint, see \u201cThe Whistleblower Complaint Timeline\u201d and \u201cQ&A on Intelligence Community Whistleblower.\u201d)\n\nStein addressed Schiff\u2019s remarks on Oct. 3, saying on MSNBC that he had spoken to Schiff, who \u201cexpressed regret for not having been more clear in his wording.\u201d Schiff said at the time \u201cthere wasn\u2019t 100% certainty that the whistleblower who had approached his staff was the same one who was behind the actual complaint,\u201d Stein said.\n\nAs for the committee\u2019s contact with the whistleblower, we don\u2019t know if the complainant had \u201cspoken\u201d to any committee staffers or contacted the committee through email or letter. On Oct. 2, Boland provided us with this statement without answering our follow-up questions: \u201cLike other whistleblowers have done before and since under Republican and Democratic-controlled Committees, the whistleblower contacted the Committee for guidance on how to report possible wrongdoing within the jurisdiction of the Intelligence Community. This is a regular occurrence, given the Committee\u2019s unique oversight role and responsibilities. Consistent with the Committee\u2019s longstanding procedures, Committee staff appropriately advised the whistleblower to contact an Inspector General and to seek legal counsel.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s support for the statement that it\u2019s \u201ca regular occurrence\u201d for whistleblowers to contact congressional committees. A May 2019 Government Accountability Office report said \u201cwhistleblowers who contact the Congress typically reach out to oversight committees, the offices of their own representatives or senators, or authorizing committees.\u201d In a 2016 story in The Intercept, a spokesman for Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, then the chair of the House intelligence committee, said the committee received whistleblower complaints in the \u201cdozens\u201d each year from both the intelligence community inspector general \u201cand via individuals who approach the committee directly.\u201d\n\nBut this \u201cregular occurrence\u201d wasn\u2019t disclosed by Schiff when asked about it. Instead, wrongly implied the committee had not been contacted, when he said, \u201cWe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
