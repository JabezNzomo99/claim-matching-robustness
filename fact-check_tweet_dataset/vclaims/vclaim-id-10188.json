Let\u2019s look at another distribution table, this time produced by the Tax Policy Center. It shows the winners and losers more clearly. In 2018, it shows 7 percent of taxpayers would have an average tax increase of more than $2,000. That\u2019s at least 10 million people. (In fact, almost 30 percent of the top 0.1 percent would experience a tax increase.)\n\nIt gets even worse in 2027, when 25 percent of taxpayers would face a tax increase. That\u2019s mainly because certain tax provisions for the middle class expire midway through the 10-year period covered by the tax cut. Strong said it was \u201cbogus\u201d to focus on that because Republicans are certain that these tax provisions would be extended. (Republicans are ending this tax cut to make the tax cut look less expensive and thus fit in the $1.5 trillion box created by the budget resolution.)\n\nAs Ryan put it to Rush Limbaugh: \u201cIt\u2019s just a sunset in five years of some provisions that we never, ever intend to be removed. \u2026 The reason we did that is to conform with the budget rules so that we can make sure that this thing cannot be filibustered in the Senate.\u201d\n\nWell, there\u2019s no guarantee the tax provisions will be extended, of course. A lot depends on the makeup of the Congress when the provisions expire in 2022. But, for the sake of argument, let\u2019s assume that the tax provisions are extended. What happens then?\n\nWhile there is no official score, Ernie Tedeschi, a managing director at Evercore ISI and former economist at the Treasury Department under Obama, crunched the numbers for 2027, assuming the policies in place at the start of the tax plan never expired. Tedeschi used the Open Source Policy Center tax model that was created by the American Enterprise Institute, so the figures are going to be different than the TPC model. But the broad trends are what is instructive.\n\nStrong pointed to Ryan\u2019s \u201cmore precise\u201d phrasing in his interview with Hemmer on Fox News. \u201cEveryone\u2019s personal financial situation is different, but the speaker was making the point that no matter where you are on the income scale, the average taxpayer sees a tax cut under our plan,\u201d she said.\n\nRegular readers know we generally do not hand out Pinocchios when a politician admits error. Ryan has admitted he misspoke and changed his language. That\u2019s always pleasing to see, and he earns credit for that shift. As regular readers know, we don\u2019t try to play gotcha here at The Fact Checker.\n\nStill, on at least three occasions over three days, Ryan spoke in sweeping terms that flatly stated every taxpayer would get a tax cut. That\u2019s wrong and misleading, and ordinarily worthy of Four Pinocchios. Even if one assumes that all of the tax provisions remain in place \u2014 a big assumption \u2014 millions of Americans will still see a tax hike, even if the average person in their income range might receive a tax cut.\n\nIn the case of married families with children \u2014 whom Republicans are assiduously wooing as beneficiaries of their plan \u2014 about 40 percent are estimated to receive tax hikes by 2027, even if the provisions are retained. That would be a nasty surprise for folks who had heard Ryan\u2019s less-precise spin. We understand the point he was trying to make but he needs to be more careful with his language in the future. We\u2019ll certainly be watching to see if Ryan\u2019s enthusiasm tips the soup again.", "lang": "en"}
