Kavanaugh and what Kavanaugh\u2019s record shows on these issues.\n\nDemocrats have described Brett Kavanaugh as \u201ca true Second Amendment radical\u201d who is \u201cfar outside the mainstream of legal thought\u201d \u2014 more conservative than the late Justice Antonin Scalia. The criticism stems from Kavanaugh\u2019s dissent in a 2011 appeals court ruling that upheld the District of Columbia\u2019s law banning semi-automatic rifles.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein cited the judge\u2019s 2011 dissent in her opening remarks on the first day of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 4.\n\nHere we take a look at Kavanaugh\u2019s record on the Second Amendment.\n\nWhat Democrats are saying: \u201cI\u2019m left with the fact that your reasoning is far outside the mainstream of legal thought and that it surpasses the views of Justice Scalia, who was clearly a pro-gun justice,\u201d Feinstein said at the Sept. 4 hearing. \u201cEven Scalia understood that weapons that are like M-16 rifles or weapons that are most useful in military service can in fact be regulated.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut tweeted on July 9: \u201cBrett Kavanaugh is a true Second Amendment radical. He believes assault weapon bans are unconstitutional, a position way out of the judicial mainstream, far to the right of even late Justice Scalia.\u201d\n\nWhat Kavanaugh\u2019s record shows: Whether a Supreme Court that includes Kavanaugh would expand gun rights and strike down some existing gun laws is a \u201csignificant question,\u201d said Amy Howe, a SCOTUS Blog writer who co-taught Supreme Court litigation at Stanford Law School and Harvard Law School.\n\n\u201cKavanaugh\u2019s track record suggests that he might be willing to do so for at least some gun laws, although he does not regard the Second Amendment as creating an absolute right to have or carry a gun,\u201d Howe wrote in a July 27 blog.\n\nIn a landmark decision in 2008, District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court found that the Second Amendment protects private gun ownership, and struck down portions of a D.C. handgun ban on those grounds. After that decision, D.C. passed gun legislation that prohibited semi-automatic rifles and the possession of magazines with more than 10 rounds of ammunition, and required gun owners to register their firearms.\n\nDick Heller, the plaintiff in the 2008 Supreme Court case, again challenged the District\u2019s new law. The case never reached the Supreme Court, but it was heard in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, where Kavanaugh is a circuit judge.\n\nThe appeals court upheld the District\u2019s ban on semi-automatic rifles and large magazines and most of its registration requirements in a decision known as \u201cHeller II.\u201d Kavanaugh dissented in that case, writing, \u201cThere is no meaningful or persuasive constitutional distinction between semi-automatic handguns and semi-automatic rifles. \u2026 It follows from Heller\u2019s protection of semi-automatic handguns that semi-automatic rifles are also constitutionally protected and that D.C.\u2019s ban on them is unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nKavanaugh wrote that the Supreme Court in Heller determined that guns in \u201ccommon use\u201d and not \u201cdangerous and unusual\u201d cannot be banned, but those that have been traditionally banned, such as short-barreled shotguns or automatic M-16s, can remain prohibited.\n\n\u201cIn disapproving D.C.\u2019s ban on handguns, in approving a ban on machine guns, and in approving longstanding regulations such as concealed-carry and felon-in-possession laws, Heller established that the scope of the Second Amendment right \u2013 and thus the constitutionality of gun bans and regulations \u2013 is determined by reference to text, history, and tradition,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote.\n\nUnder questioning by Feinstein on Sept. 5, Kavanaugh said he merely applied the Supreme Court\u2019s Heller test in writing his dissent, saying semi-automatic rifles \u201cseemed to fit common use and not being \u2026 a dangerous and unusual weapon.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, whether I agree with that test or not was not the issue before me,\u201d Kavanaugh told Feinstein. \u201cI have to follow the precedent of the Supreme Court as it\u2019s written, and that\u2019s what I tried to do in that case.\u201d\n\nHowe, writing on SCOTUS blog, said Kavanaugh\u2019s \u201cdiscussion of the proper test to use to review gun laws suggests that he might be willing to uphold some gun laws, such as those requiring a license to carry a concealed weapon, as long as they are consistent with the history and tradition of regulating guns.\u201d\n\nWhat Democrats are saying: Feinstein said Kavanaugh\u2019s dissenting opinion shows that his position on the Second Amendment \u201csurpasses the views of Justice Scalia.\u201d\n\nWhat Kavanaugh\u2019s record shows: In Heller, Scalia wrote that \u201cthe Second Amendment right is not unlimited,\u201d but examples he gave for which weapons are unprotected did not include a blanket statement about \u201cassault weapons.\u201d He instead relied on the \u201ccommon use\u201d argument, protecting arms in widespread use historically, leaving open the possibility that he, like Kavanaugh, would be against banning semi-automatic rifles.\n\nMoreover, in Friedman v. City of Highland Park, Scalia later joined a dissent with Justice Clarence Thomas that suggested he believed semi-automatic rifles should be protected. The 2015 dissent stated that \u201c[r]oughly five million Americans own AR-style semiautomatic rifles \u2026 that is all that is needed for citizens to have a right under the Second Amendment to keep such weapons.\u201d\n\nIn comparing Kavanaugh to Scalia, Feinstein, sponsor of the Assault Weapons Ban of 2018, said, \u201cEven Scalia understood that weapons that are like M-16 rifles or weapons that are most useful in military service can in fact be regulated,\u201d suggesting that Kavanaugh believes that M-16 rifles are constitutionally protected. But Kavanaugh specifically said in the 2011 Heller v. District of Columbia dissent that the Supreme Court in Heller ruled that \u201cshotguns and automatic \u2018M-16 rifles and the like\u2019 are not in common use and have been permissibly banned by Congress.\u201d\n\nCompounding the problem is a semantic debate over the term \u201cassault weapons,\u201d a persistent source of disagreement in the ongoing battle over gun control and gun rights.\n\nWhile Heller II notes that \u201cassault weapon\u201d refers to \u201ccertain brands and models of semi-automatic rifles, pistols, and shotguns,\u201d Kavanaugh objected to that terminology. He accused others of using \u201cassault weapons\u201d as a \u201crhetorical term,\u201d and instead suggested that handguns are the real assault weapons because they are \u201cused far more often than any other kind of gun in violent crimes.\u201d Under Kavanaugh\u2019s assumption, the Supreme Court would have already forbidden a ban on assault weapons, in the 2008 Heller decision.\n\nWhile he did not support the ban on semi-automatic rifles, Kavanaugh did acknowledge that \u201cfully automatic weapons, also known as machine guns, have traditionally been banned and may continue to be banned after Heller.\u201d\n\nWe should also note that, if confirmed, Kavanaugh would replace outgoing Justice Anthony Kennedy, who sided with Scalia in opposing the District\u2019s handgun ban.\n\nPublic Safety vs. the Right to Bear Arms\n\nWhat Democrats are saying: In her opening remarks at the confirmation hearing, Feinstein expressed concern that Kavanaugh would not properly weigh public safety concerns when considering new laws restricting gun use, sale and possession.\n\n\u201cIf the Supreme Court were to adopt your reasoning, I fear the number of victims would continue to grow and citizens would be rendered powerless in enacting sensible gun laws,\u201d said Feinstein, who authored the 10-year national ban on certain semi-automatic assault weapons, which expired in 2004, as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.\n\nWhat Kavanaugh\u2019s record shows: It is true that in his 2011 dissent, Kavanaugh rejected the argument that public safety concerns in the District of Columbia overrode the constitutional right to bear arms.\n\nKavanaugh said, as a longtime resident of the District, he is aware of the gun violence and \u201cgreatly respect[s] the motivation behind the D.C. gun laws at issue in this case.\u201d But he said his job is to follow the precedents of the Supreme Court, not decide what is \u201cthe best policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf our job were to decree what we think is the best policy, I would carefully consider the issues through that different lens and might well look favorably upon certain regulations of this kind,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut our task is to apply the Constitution and the precedents of the Supreme Court, regardless of whether the result is one we agree with as a matter of first principles or policy.\u201d\n\nHe did, however, suggest in his dissent that he may be open to upholding laws that ban large-capacity magazines. He said he would remand the District\u2019s ban on the possession of magazines with more than 10 rounds of ammunition to the District Court for an analysis of \u201cthe history and prevalence of magazines of more than 10 rounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn order to apply Heller\u2019s test to this prohibition, we must know whether magazines with more than 10 rounds have traditionally been banned and are not in common use,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote.\n\nClarification, Sept. 10: We clarified that the 1994 law banning some guns covered certain semi-automatic assault weapons.", "lang": "en"}
