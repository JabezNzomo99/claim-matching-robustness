If you have a serious allergy to something like latex or certain antibiotics, vaccines containing those chemicals may cause a serious reaction. Someone with an allergy would also get this reaction if they used a latex product, or were put on that specific antibiotic for the first time.\n\nSome of the health issues listed in the image have been observed in studies using animals, or have known side-effects in humans. But this is only in much higher concentrations than would ever be present in vaccines.\n\nAluminium salts are in many vaccines (for example, the HPV vaccine) for a variety of reasons. According to the Vaccine Knowledge Project at the University of Oxford (a group of consultants, researchers, nurses and statisticians looking at vaccines at the university\u2019s Department of Paediatrics) aluminium salts \u201cslow down the release of the active ingredient from the vaccine once it is injected, and stimulate the immune system to respond.\u201d\n\nMost experts agree that there isn\u2019t strong enough evidence to show aluminium can cause Alzheimer\u2019s. Aluminium and other metals are also seen in healthy brains.\n\nAluminium is present in all sort of things naturally, like food and drinking water, and aluminium salts are a common food additive. Most of it we excrete. A 2018 study measured aluminium levels in blood and hair samples of babies and found there was no correlation between the aluminium levels and how many vaccines they\u2019d had.\n\nOther studies have shown aluminium from food and vaccines doesn\u2019t cause unsafe build up.\n\nThis chemical, in a vapour form, is used to disinfect vaccines, as well as to clean surgical equipment. It may be present in trace amounts (leftover from the manufacturing process) in some UK vaccines, like the flu jab Flucelvax and the rabies vaccine.\n\nThere are other side effects the chemical can cause, but only if someone is exposed to it in much larger amounts than would ever end up in a vaccine. These can range from irritation to the eyes and skin to burns, and there\u2019s a possibility it can cause cancer in humans, although these effects have only been seen in studies on rodents.\n\nThese two chemicals are antibiotics, which are used in the production of vaccines to stop bacteria growing in them.\n\nBecause of this, only trace amounts of these can end up in vaccines (for example tiny amounts of both gentamicin and polymyxin b may be in the inactivated flu vaccine).\n\nThese are harmless, unless of course, you are allergic to them. Antibiotics most likely to cause allergic reactions, like penicillin, aren\u2019t used in vaccine production.\n\nAllergies can cause a wide range of reactions. The NHS says \u201cMost allergic reactions are mild, but occasionally a severe reaction called anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock can occur. This is a medical emergency and needs urgent treatment.\u201d\n\nYeast is used to make the HPV vaccine Gardasil, which is used in the UK, but there\u2019s no yeast in the actual vaccine. That means it\u2019s safe even for those who are allergic to yeast.\n\nWhen the image claims that there\u2019s genetically modified DNA in vaccines, we think it means recombinant DNA technology. This is where some of the DNA of the virus or bacteria causing the disease in question is snipped out and put into another cell, for example a yeast cell. This hybrid cell makes large amounts of the protein or sugar which are used in the vaccine. The sugars and proteins are usually a harmless bit of the virus or bacteria\u2019s outer layer, which the body recognises and fights if you get the actual disease in future.\n\nThe DNA itself isn\u2019t likely to get into the vaccine. And even if it did, there\u2019s no evidence that it can cause \u201cunknown genetic mutations\u201d in humans, because DNA from the vaccine can\u2019t simply insert itself into a person\u2019s DNA.\n\nGlutaraldehyde is a used in the manufacture of some vaccines to inactivate potentially harmful chemicals released by bacteria. It\u2019s only present in trace amounts in these vaccines, such as the pre-school booster vaccine, and not enough to do any harm.\n\nThe Vaccine Knowledge Project says that the amount of natural formaldehyde in a two month-old\u2019s blood is around ten times greater than the amount found in any vaccine.\n\nFormaldehyde is carcinogenic and can cause skin and eye damage, but only in certain concentrations. It\u2019s not banned in Europe, but the EU is moving to limit workers\u2019 exposure to it, which would affect those working the funeral industry amongst others.\n\nThere may be trace amounts in the Hepatitis B vaccine, where it\u2019s used during production to kill the virus. The amount that could end up in vaccines is not high enough to be dangerous though.\n\nLatex can be used in the packaging of certain vaccines. This can potentially cause harm, but only to those with serious latex allergies.\n\nHuman or animal cells are sometimes the best way to grow a virus needed to make the vaccine, but these cells are unlikely to make it to the final vaccine.\n\nIn the UK human cells are used to grow the viruses for the rubella part of the MMR vaccines, the shingles vaccine, and the chicken pox vaccines. The cells used for these originate from the lung cells taken in the 1960s from two aborted foetuses. The Vaccine Knowledge Project says the abortions were not done to develop vaccines, they were legal and agreed to by the women concerned.\n\nThiomersal (also known as thimerosal) is a mercury-based chemical, which is no longer found in most standard UK vaccines. It was removed \u201cas a precaution\u201d, according to the Vaccine Knowledge Project, and there was no evidence it caused harm.\n\nThere has been concern around a slightly different mercury-based chemical, which can build up in humans. But a study has shown the mercury in thiomersal itself does not appear to collect in the human body.\n\nA large Australian study in 2016 found no link between thiomersal in vaccines and developing autism.\n\nMonosodium glutamate has not been banned in Europe, and is a flavouring safe to use in food. It\u2019s used in small amounts in some vaccines to stabilise them, protecting them from things like temperature change.\n\nIn a study looking at rat fertility and MSG consumption (not injections), the authors found there was some negative impact on the rats\u2019 fertility. But they also concluded there needed to be more research to confirm the link. We\u2019ve not found any studies that prove MSG causes birth defects or development issues in humans.\n\nThis is another antibiotic, which it is possible to be allergic to, which may be present in trace amounts in certain vaccines.\n\nTaking this as an antibiotic does have potential side effects, but epilepsy and brain damage aren\u2019t listed among them.\n\nThere is some evidence that being on a course of the antibiotic can affect Vitamin B6 levels, and some patients having seizures have been treated with vitamin B6. Only people taking neomycin for more than a few days usually need to take Vitamin B6 supplements.\n\nThese two chemicals have been used as preservatives in some vaccines. They aren\u2019t the same as any of the standard chemicals mixed with water to create antifreeze for engines though. There are other chemicals that are present in antifreeze which may have caused confusion with vaccines.\n\nEthylene glycol is what is commonly used in antifreeze. Polyethylene glycol, which sounds similar but isn\u2019t the same thing, is sometimes an ingredient in antifreeze and is used in some vaccines but is safe in these quantities. It\u2019s also used higher concentrations as a laxative.\n\nPolysorbate 80 is present in tiny amounts in the flu vaccine Fluad, amongst others, to stop the vaccine separating into its component parts. It\u2019s also used as a food additive in things like ice cream. Polysorbate 20 is present in certain vaccines too.\n\nIn a study where mice were given large amounts of polysorbate 80 and then colon cancer was induced, the mice given the additive were found to have more developed tumours. These animal results aren\u2019t directly applicable to humans though. Relatively, the mice were given more of polysorbate 80 than humans would ever eat, let alone than would be present in vaccines.\n\nWe can\u2019t find evidence that this is present in any UK vaccines, although it is used in some injected medicines to treat haemophilia.\n\nWhen the EU was reviewing the chemical in 2013 it said studies on whether it damaged the nervous system were \u201ccontradictory\u201d. It also said \u201csome studies suggest that tributyl phosphate might have adverse effects on [the] kidney\u201d.\n\nA 2012 report into its safety found evidence people working with the chemical had reported some nausea, headaches and irritation, but they were exposed to it in larger concentrations that would be present in medicines.", "lang": "en"}
