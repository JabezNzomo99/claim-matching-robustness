Gay McDougall is quoted by several news agencies as saying Beijing had \"turned the Uighur autonomous region into something that resembles a massive internment camp.\"\n\n\u200bThe news reports said Chinese officials did not respond, though China's ambassador to the UN earlier told the panel his countries policies toward minorities promote unity and harmony.\n\nLate Sunday, the Global Times, the Chinese state newspaper, said in an editorial the security situation in Xinjiang had \"turned around,\" following what it said were a series of terrorist attacks in the autonomous region and in China's interior.\n\nThe tabloid did indicate \"police and security posts can be seen everywhere\" in the region but did not mention detention facilities, saying that the West is \"smearing\" the regional government.\n\nWe chose to fact check the statement in the same newspaper earlier in August, similar in tone to the Sunday editorial -- the August 1 article representing Beijing's response to months of reports from human rights groups and in the media.\n\nSince the spring of 2017, human rights watchers have been calling attention to China\u2019s increasingly repressive measures against its Uighur Muslim population in the autonomous region of Xinjiang in the Western part of the country. Witnesses tell of everything from everyday discrimination, such as being barred from renting hotel rooms, to disappearances and \u201cre-education centers\u201d that some have likened to concentration camps.\n\nIn September 2017, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the government in China \u201cshould immediately free people held in \u2018unlawful\u2019 political education centers.\u201dThe global fact-finding and advocacy organization cited its own interview with relatives of detainees held in facilities near Kashgar City and the Bortala Prefecture.\n\nHRW said the Muslim Uighur minority was targeted and it cited media reports saying ethnic Kazakhs and Kyrgyz has been detained for traveling abroad.\n\nOn August 10, the Associated Press reported thousands of Muslims from the Hui minority staged a rare public protest of the planned demolition of the Grand Mosque in the town of Weizhou. The Hui minority is the largest Islamic group in China, descendants of the Han Chinese.\n\nWhile the Chinese state publication, Global Times, blames \u201cwestern media\u201d for \u201ca new round of attacks,\u201d the evidence includes many reports from inside China as well as eyewitness testimony \u2013 enough to firmly label the claim \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\nAnd it should be noted Al Jazeera also filed a report on the allegations made in Geneva.\n\nLast year, a state official in Xinjiang denied allegations of Muslim persecution, stating that \u201cThe happiest Muslims in the world live in Xinjiang.\u201d The official blamed claims to the contrary on \u201chostile Western forces\u201d who \u201cwantonly spread rumors.\u201d\n\nThe official did not suggest any metric by which one could measure the happiness of Xinjiang\u2019s Muslims or compare it to those in other countries. The United Nations\u2019 World Happiness 2017 report, however, said the happiest Muslims live in the United Arab Emirates and not Xinjiang or anywhere else in China.\n\nSeveral years in a row, Chinese authorities in Xinjiang have attempted to ban fasting during the Muslim the holy month of Ramadan. In February, the state-run outlet Global Times published an article about Chinese Muslims going on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, considered a requirement for all faithful Muslims who can afford to make the journey. What it does not mention, however, is that the government, which organizes the groups going on the Hajj, furnished pilgrims with special electronic cards equipped with GPS tracking devices.\n\nNumerous reports of arbitrary arrests and violent interrogations of Uighurs contradict the state\u2019s claims about happy Muslims. HRW said state media in Xinjiang have reported on the reeducation facilities, calling them \u201ccounter extremism training centers.\n\nIn 2009, ethnic riots in Xinjiang\u2019s capital city of Urumqi led to as many as 200 deaths. In 2017, the government sent thousands of troops to Xinjiang, ostensibly to defend against \u201cterrorism\u201d and separatism. In 2015, after a string of terrorist attacks traced back to Xinjiang, the government declared a \u201cPeople\u2019s war\u201d on terror. However, human rights advocates call China\u2019s anti-terrorism policy in Xinjiang an attempt to forcibly assimilate and destroy Uighur and Kazakh culture.\n\nIn Geneva, the human rights panel expects to continue its meeting Monday and Polygraph.info will update, depending on more developments.\n\n(Editor's Note: This fact check was updated with China's response to developments out of Geneva).", "lang": "en"}
