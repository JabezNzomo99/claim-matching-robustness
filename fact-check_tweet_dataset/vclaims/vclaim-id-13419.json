No, that's not true: the story originated from a German satire website. It is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by the Berliner Express on November 20, 2018 titled \"Papua-Neuguinea: Kannibalenst\u00e4mme wollen Fl\u00fcchtlinge aufnehmen\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nIn the face of global discussions surrounding the UN Migration Pact, the Council of Cannibal Tribes in Papua New Guinea has approached the UN. One would take up to 48,000 refugees a year. PORT MORESBY, NEW YORK (fna) - Although Papua New Guinea is considered a poor country, but also as one with warmhearted people. This proves a request of the Council of cannibal tribes of the country at the UN. According to them, they want to take in up to 48,000 refugees each year and integrate them as quickly as possible into their own society. Jono Yamago, President of the Council, told the news agency fna: \"Our council represents the interests of more than 180 tribes, with a total of around 460,000 people. We consider it our duty to help these poor people in need. \"He emphasized the\" very integrative system \"prevailing among the tribes he represents. \"We have the cultural principle that every stranger quickly becomes part of us.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail, so some people might have thought it was from a real news website:\n\nHowever The Berliner Express comes with a long disclaimer (archived here) in German:\n\nWe started this website to make people think. Is it really true? Can that really be? Quite a few of our articles have been believed to be true - because one simply trusts the individual or party to actually make such claims or to make such statements. We also find that there is not enough online satire and too little exaggerated criticism of the prevailing (political, social and economic) system. We want to counter that with our \"Berliner Express\". Besides \"Der Postillon\" (Germany) and \"Die Tagespresse\" (Austria), we want to position the Berliner Express as the third major satire portal in order to strengthen the press diversity in this area as well. You can confidently assume that our articles were invented - at least in part - completely free. But it may be that satire becomes reality. But we can not influence that.\n\nIts tagline is \"Nachrichten aus dem Zentrum der (Ohn)Macht\" which translates to \"News from the heart of power(lessness)\".\n\nThe site is run by the same people who are behind contra-magazin.com, a German-language right-wing conservative news website: it shares an IP addres and an Adsense account with it and the satire site is listed under \"Befreundete Portale\" (friendly portals) in the site footer. It also lists the same publisher (All Inclusive Media Inc.) and editor in chief (Marco Maier).", "lang": "en"}
