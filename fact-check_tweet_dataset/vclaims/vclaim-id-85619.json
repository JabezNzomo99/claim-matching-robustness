While the president dismisses this as \u201cfake news,\u201d the problem for the White House is that some of these women have produced witnesses who say they heard about the incident at the time \u2014 long before Trump made his political aspirations known.\n\nSuch contemporaneous accounts are essential to establishing the credibility of the allegation because they reduce the chances that a person is making up a story for political purposes. In the case of sexual allegations, such accounts can help bolster the credibility of the \u201cshe said\u201d side of the equation. Often, a sexual assault will happen behind closed doors. The contemporary corroborators can explain what they heard at the time and whether the story being told now is consistent with how the story was told years earlier. This does not necessarily mean the allegation is true, but it does give journalistic organizations more confidence to report on the allegation.\n\nBelow is a summary of the corroborators provided by three of the women who have accusations, drawn from a fact check written during the presidential campaign. That fact check also detailed the witnesses who backed up claims of sexual accusations against former president Bill Clinton \u2014 who, like Trump, insisted the women accusing him were not telling the truth.\n\nBrad Trent, a New York photographer. He says he heard the story from Anderson at a dinner in 2007. \u201cIt was just girls saying stories about how they got hit on by creepy old guys,\u201d Trent said of the conversation around the table.\n\nHer allegation: While interviewing Trump in 2005 for an article for People magazine about the first anniversary of his third marriage, Trump lured her into a room at Mar-a-Lago and abruptly kissed her, forcing his tongue down her throat. He then said they were going to have an affair.\n\nLiz McNeil, at the time a reporter for People (she is now an editor). She said that she heard about the incident the day after Stoynoff returned from her assignment. \u201cShe was very upset and told me how he shoved her against a wall,\u201d she said.\n\nMary Green, another People reporter (now editor) who had just returned to New York. \u201cIn an early conversation we had in her office, she told me about what happened with Donald Trump,\u201d Green said. \u201cShe was shaky, sitting at her desk, relaying that, \u2018He took me to this other room, and when we stepped inside, he pushed me against a wall and stuck his tongue down my throat. Melania was upstairs and could have walked in at any time.\u2019 \u201d\n\nPaul McLaughlin, Stoynoff\u2019s former journalism professor. He said Stoynoff called him at the time of the alleged incident seeking advice on how to handle it: \u201cShe didn\u2019t know what to do, she was very conflicted, she was angry, she was really confused about how to deal with this.\u201d After a discussion, he said, Stoynoff decided it would be best if she kept the incident to herself.\n\nBrianne Webb, her sister. She said Crooks called her immediately about the incident as soon as she returned to her desk. \u201cBeing from a town of 1,600 people, being naive, I was like, \u2018Are you sure he didn\u2019t just miss trying to kiss you on the cheek?\u2019 She said, \u2018No, he kissed me on the mouth.\u2019 I was like, \u2018That is not normal.\u2019\u201d", "lang": "en"}
