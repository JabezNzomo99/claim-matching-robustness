The picture is being shared in the backdrop of the death of African-American George Floyd in the same manner in the United States.\n\nFacebook user \"Sabiha Mir\" posted the photo with the caption, \"An Israeli soldier on the top and an innocent Palestinian child's neck under his kneecap. The Israeli soldier suffocated the child to death while he begging to breathe just like George Floyd did. Unfortunately this is a normal practice by Israeli soldiers in Palestine.\"\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the photo to be false. It is a four-year-old incident from the Latin American country of Chile wherein a young boy was arrested for painting graffiti on the walls.\n\nThe misleading post is being widely circulated on social media. The archive version can be seen here. Some Hindi websites have also published an article on the viral post, believing it to be true.\n\nWith the help of InVID tool, we found an article in Spanish regarding the incident. The article, published on October 2, 2016, used a video of the act and said the incident took place in Chile's Valpara\u00edso city.\n\nWe also found a video of the incident on Facebook.\n\nUsing some keywords in Spanish, we found another report by Chilean radio station ADN on the incident. This report also says that the video is from Valpara\u00edso and identifies the security official as Chilean police officer F Venegas.\n\n\"24 horas\", a news website in Chile, also reported the incident in October 2016. As per this report, the cop caught the boy doing graffiti on a wall and detained him.\n\nLooking at the video closely, we noticed a green insignia on the arm of the police officer. This insignia matches with the logo of 'Carabineros de Chile'- Chile's national police force.\n\nAll the above evidences prove that the viral photo is from Chile and is not related to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Also, none of the news reports say that the boy died.\n\nThough the viral picture is from Chile, there are several reports of Israeli soldiers detaining Palestinians in a similar manner - by kneeling on the neck. After the death of George Floyd, many activists drew a parallel between US and Israeli forces.", "lang": "en"}
