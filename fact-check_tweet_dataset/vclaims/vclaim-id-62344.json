The claim is false; the same footage has circulated in Chinese media reports since at least August 2017 about an incident in China\u2019s Guizhou province.\n\nThe one-minute 19-second video was published on Weibo here on June 28, 2020. It has since been viewed more than 440 times.\n\nThe video\u2019s simplified Chinese caption translates to English as:\n\n \u201c/Oh god! The rain in Chongqing is way too heavy this year!\n\n \"Car and people got trapped, should have rescued people without caring about the car!\n\n \"Can't give up property rather than lives!\n\n \"People from the car were all washed away by the flood!\u201d\n\nChongqing and other cities in southern China experienced major storms in late June 2020. The heavy rain killed at least 12 people and sparked mass evacuations, as AFP reported here.\n\nThe video was also shared alongside a similar claim on Facebook here and here, and on Twitter here, here and here.\n\nA reverse image search with video keyframes found the same footage was published here by FM1035 Huzhou Traffic Radio on September 12, 2017.\n\nThe article states that an off-road vehicle was washed into a river in Guizhou province on the afternoon of August 30, 2017. The footage shared in the misleading posts can be seen in the article\u2019s embedded video in the first eight seconds. It can also be seen from the 55-second mark to the one-minute six-second mark.\n\nBelow are two sets of comparisons between the video in the misleading Weibo post (L) and the video included in the Chinese media article (R):\n\nThe same incident was also reported on in 2017 by other Chinese media organisations, including here by the news site The Paper and here by Beijing Youth Daily.", "lang": "en"}
