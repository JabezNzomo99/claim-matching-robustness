Trump appeared to raise the possibility that gun rights supporters could take matters into their own hands if Hillary Clinton is elected president and appoints judges who favor stricter gun control measures. Repeating his contention that Mrs. Clinton wanted to abolish the right to bear arms, Mr. Trump warned at a rally that it would be \u201ca horrible day\u201d if Mrs. Clinton were elected and got to appoint a tiebreaking Supreme Court justice. \u201cIf she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,\u201d Mr. Trump said, as the crowd began to boo. He quickly added: \u201cAlthough the Second Amendment people \u2014 maybe there is, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Oblique as it was, Mr. Trump\u2019s remark quickly elicited a wave of condemnation from Democrats, gun control advocates and others, who accused him of suggesting violence against Mrs. Clinton or liberal jurists.\n\n\n\nThat controversy prompted counter-claims that Hillary Clinton herself had once made similar comments in 2008 by referencing assassinated 1968 presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy in a discussion about her race for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination against Barack Obama. Although many people following the 2016 presidential race didn\u2019t know or recall whether any such thing had occurred, the comment attributed to Clinton remains widely verifiable online in archived 2008 campaign news.\n\nThe remark in question was originally made to the editorial board of a newspaper in May 2008 in response to questions about why Clinton remained in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination seemingly past the point of having any real chance of winning it:\n\nHillary Clinton cited the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy during the 1968 presidential campaign to explain why she was remaining in the race despite long odds. \u201cWe all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California,\u201d Clinton told the editorial board of a South Dakota newspaper. \u201d I don\u2019t understand it,\u201d Clinton added, alluding to the calls for her to quit. Clinton made the statement after pointing out that her husband didn\u2019t lock up the nomination until June of 1992, trying to point out that, by past history, it\u2019s not late in the campaign. But Barack Obama received Secret Service protection one year ago, the earliest ever in presidential history, after reports of threats. Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton said in a statement: \u201cSen. Clinton\u2019s statement before the Argus Leader editorial board was unfortunate and has no place in this campaign.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe 2016 resurrection of that remark was often accompanied by suggestions that Clinton had \u201cskated by\u201d with little criticism for her \u201cinsensitive\u201d and \u201cheartless\u201d comment, while Donald Trump was widely pilloried for his \u201cominous\u201d aside. That wasn\u2019t an accurate assessment, however, as the New York Times reported at the time:\n\nThe speed at which the remarks were transmitted and reacted to illustrated the new reality candidates are grappling with in this year\u2019s campaign, in which Mr. Obama\u2019s own remarks about \u201cbitter\u201d small-town voters ricocheted around the Internet. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remarks were initially reported online by The New York Post, whose reporters were not traveling with the Clinton campaign but were instead watching a live video feed of the meeting with newspaper editors. Its report quickly jumped to the Drudge Report, then whipped around the Internet and on television, with outraged comments piling up on Web sites.\n\n\n\nAlso among the critics of Clinton\u2019s comments at the time was angry former MSNBC anchor Keith Olbermann:\n\nMoreover, while Donald Trump has so far offered no apology for his remark, Hillary Clinton promptly did so back in 2008:\n\nEarlier today I was discussing the Democratic primary history and in the course of that discussion mentioned the campaigns that both my husband and Senator Kennedy waged in California in June 1992 and 1968 and I was referencing those to make the point that we have had nomination primary contests that go into June. That\u2019s a historic fact. The Kennedys have been much on my mind the last days because of Senator Kennedy and I regret that if my referencing that moment of trauma for our entire nation, and particularly for the Kennedy family was in any way offensive. I certainly had no intention of that, whatsoever. My view is that we have to look to the past and to our leaders who have inspired us and give us a lot to live up to, and I\u2019m honored to hold Senator Kennedy\u2019s seat in the United States Senate from the state of New York and have the highest regard for the entire Kennedy family.\u201d The Kennedys have been much on my mind the last days because of Sen. Kennedy and I regret that if my referencing that moment of trauma for our entire nation, and particularly for the Kennedy family, was in any way offensive,\u201d she said.", "lang": "en"}
