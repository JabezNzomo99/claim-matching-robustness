This is false; his office says he is Christian, and the photos in the article are from a Muslim religious event he hosted in an official capacity.\n\n\u201cIt has become evident through the photographs that Wolf has in fact already converted. According to Islam it is not permissible for a non-Muslim to pray either in the ranks or on his own,\u201d according to the article, which has been shared here and here on Facebook, here on Twitter and here on Reddit.\n\n\u201cHe needs to come out and explain to the voters in his state as to why he converted,\u201d a user commented on one of the Facebook posts, while others suggested he should be removed from office.\n\nThe article claiming that Wolf converted to Islam shows pictures of him joining Muslims in prayer, but they were shot in August 2019 during Eid al-Adha celebrations at the Pennsylvania governor's residence.\n\n\u201cGovernor Wolf is incredibly proud to be the first Pennsylvania governor to host an Eid al-Adha ceremony and honored to be invited to participate in ceremonial prayers, during which these photos were taken,\u201d his press secretary J.J. Abbott told AFP by email.\n\nHe \u201cis a person of deep faith and, while a Christian, has great respect for the Muslim community in Pennsylvania and our commonwealth\u2019s founding principle of freedom of conscience,\u201d Abbott added.\n\nWolf has since 2016 hosted Eid al-Adha dinners at the governor\u2019s residence, where he also holds events celebrating holidays from other religions, such as Passover, Easter, and Diwali.", "lang": "en"}
