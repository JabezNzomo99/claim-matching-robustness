There has been more than 47,000 COVID-19 cases in Bengal, till July 21.\n\nThe 17 second footage has been captioned as, \"Democracy is in danger today, hence such a scenario can be seen in West Bengal'' (Original caption in Bangla: \u0997\u09a3\u09a4\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0 \u0986\u099c \u09ac\u09bf\u09aa\u09a8\u09cd\u09a8 \u09a4\u09be\u0987 \u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be\u09df \u098f\u09b0\u0995\u09ae \u09a6\u09c3\u09b6 \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u0995\u09be\u09b6 \u09aa\u09be\u09df)\n\nThe post can be seen here and has been archived here.\n\nA Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader of West Bengal, Phalguni Patra, had also shared the video on her official Facebook page with the same narrative. The video has since been deleted. Below is a screenshot of the Facebook post.\n\nBOOM was able to ascertain that the video is from Uttar Pradesh. On observing closely, we found a location mentioned as Deoria, UP, on the top right corner of the viral footage.\n\nWe broke the video into its key-frames and ran a reverse image search on a few of its frames and found the same video, which was uploaded in several news reports on the incident.\n\nAccording to a report by India Today the incident happened in a Deoria district hospital in Uttar Pradesh where a six-year-old boy was filmed while pushing a stretcher carrying his ill grandfather, along with his mother. The family had to operate the stretcher for the patient, as a ward boy allegedly demanded Rs 30 for pushing the stretcher to different wards. The ward boy of the hospital's surgical ward was subsequently removed.\n\nThe footage created an outrage among citizens and caught the attention of Deoria district magistrate, Amit Kishore who visited the hospital and ordered a probe into the episode. \n\n\n\nAccording to a Times of India report, the patient was from Gaura Village in Deoria district who was injured two days before the incident took place and was admitted in the surgical ward of the hospital. He was attended by his daughter and her 6-year-old son. When a hospital staff demanded a bribe of Rs 30 every time for pushing the stretcher to the ward for dressing, his daughter refused to pay the money. \n\n\n\nKishore set up a probe and sent the case to the Chief Medical Officer of Deoria for investigation. He has further mentioned that the ward boy has been removed from the ward and necessary action has been taken.\n\nAlso read: Bahubali Of Assam?
