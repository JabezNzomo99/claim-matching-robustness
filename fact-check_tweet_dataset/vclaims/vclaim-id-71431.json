The quote, which was laden with spelling errors, read, \"Bakit po enaristo ang isang guro na nabibigay lang ng supurta sa ating kumpanya sya lamang po ay nagpapahayag bilang isang sopurta para maalis ang isang lider na wala kwenta sa ating bansa.\"\n\nThe graphic contained the logo and social media handles of ABS-CBN News. It was dated May 8 and had the description: \"Actor Coco Martin on the NTC forcing ABS-CBN to cease its broadcast operations.\"\n\nThe facts: Martin did not say this quote. The graphic was manipulated from an ABS-CBN News quote card.\n\nRappler earlier debunked a similar claim, which said that Martin thanked Ronnel Mas, the 25-year-old teacher who was arrested for his tweet about a P50-million reward for the person who will \"kill President Rodrigo Duterte.\" \u2013 Loreben Tuquero/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
