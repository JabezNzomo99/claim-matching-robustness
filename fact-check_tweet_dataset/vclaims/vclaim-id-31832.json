They were spectacularly wrong-footed in this election too. The theory that punters are smarter than pollsters is now a dead letter.\"\n\nThe fortunes of prime ministers and political parties have risen and crashed on the back of opinion polls. But the polls for the May 18 federal election were consistently wrong, pointing to a Labor victory. The pollsters are now under fire as they conduct post-mortem examinations on their data and methodology. [1]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined the claim by Ipsos pollster Jess Elgood that while betting markets are often cited as a better indicator of an election outcome they too were \u201cspectacularly wrong-footed\u201d by the May 18 result and as a result the theory that punters are smarter than pollsters is now dead.\n\nOn May 16, 2019 two days before polling day, Sportsbet issued a media statement stating \u201cpunters have declared Saturday\u2019s federal election run and won, backing Labor into Winx-like odds of $1.16 with 70 per cent of all money wagered on the election going on Bill Shorten\u2019s team\u201d. [2]\n\nSportsbet paid out more than $1.3 million to punters who backed a Labor victory before the May 18 poll result. One punter collected $128,000 before a single vote had been counted. Sportsbet\u2019s communications manager Rich Hummerston said: \u201cOur punters have spoken through their bets! 7 of every 10 bets on the election are on Labor. They\u2019re supremely confident we will be paying out on Saturday so we have decided to pay them early. Punters rarely get it wrong on elections.\u201d [2] [3] [4]\n\nOn election day Sportsbet.com.au said the betting trend over the previous 48 hours had favoured Bill Shorten and Labor to win and offered odds of $1.10. The coalition was at $7. Late on election night, Sportsbet admitted its error of paying out early with a combined dig at United Australia Party leader Clive Palmer in a tweet: \u201cYep, we blew $1.3 million. Could have been $80 million though eh Clive?\" [3]\n\nTAB issued a media release on May 17 with the headline \u2018$100k bet for Labor as betting surge continues\u2019. It had Labor priced at $1.15 for victory and the coalition at $5.50. TAB\u2019s communication advisor Gerard Daffy admitted afterwards that the election result was another example of bookmakers misreading the political landscape. \u201cThis result joins the 2016 election of Donald Trump and the Brexit referendum in the same year as recent political events where the betting market has not predicted the winner,\" he said. [5]\n\nOnline gambling firm Betfair had Labor priced at $1.08 and the coalition at $11.50 just before polling closed in eastern Australia. [6]\n\nAAP FactCheck found betting markets produced mixed results in predicting the outcome of the previous three federal elections in 2010, 2013 and 2016.\n\nIn 2016 the punters got it right betting on the coalition to be returned to government. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull won with a reduced majority of 76 seats while Labor claimed 69 seats. Two days before the July 2 poll, Sportsbet had Labor priced at $8 and the coalition at $1.08 while Centrebet had the coalition at $1.10 and Labor at $7. [7] [8]\n\nIn a betting preview for the 2016 poll on June 30, Ladbrokes said betting on the coalition had been \u201cvery steady at the $1.10 mark for a number of weeks now\u201d adding the surprise Brexit result on June 23 had cast some doubt the coalition \u201care as much of a sure thing as the betting suggests\u201d. [9]\n\nPunters also correctly called the outcome of the 2013 election. On September 6, a day before the 2013 election, Sportsbet declared the Rudd Labor government was unbackable and shifted the focus to the number of seats the coalition was likely to win. The coalition led by Tony Abbott was at odds of $1.85 to win 91 to 100 seats. The coalition won 90 seats to Labor\u2019s 55. [10]\n\nIn 2010 the punters installed the Gillard Labor government as favourite but there was a late surge for opposition leader Tony Abbott. BetEasy reported an \u201cunprecedented election eve plunge\u201d on Mr Abbott. William Hill Australia shortened its odds for a coalition victory over the Gillard Labor government from $3.60 to $2.60 in the space of eight hours, however the bookmakers maintained Labor as the favourite at $1.48. Similarly, Sportingbet and Centrebet also reported late betting surges for Mr Abbott and the coalition. [11] [12]\n\nThe 2010 result saw Labor and the coalition claim 72 seats each. Protracted negotiations with independents and Greens MPs resulted in a minority Labor government for Prime Minister Julia Gillard. [13]\n\nBased on the evidence, Ms Elgood\u2019s claim that betting markets were \u201cspectacularly wrong-footed\u201d for the 2019 election is true. However, there is an error in her claim that \u201cpunters are smarter than pollsters is now a dead letter\u201d because betting correctly reflected the results for 2016 and 2013 elections and punters had an each-way bet in 2010 which produced an each-way result.", "lang": "en"}
