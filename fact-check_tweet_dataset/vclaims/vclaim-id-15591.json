Let\u2019s try to analyze the veracity of the claims made in the post.\n\nClaim 1: Indira Gandhi as a token of appreciation, invited IPS Officer Kiran Bedi to breakfast for checking her car during an election campaign Fact: Kiran Bedi never issued a challan on Indira Gandhi\u2019s car during any election campaign. The photo in the post was the one taken when Indira Gandhi invited Kiran Bedi for breakfast for leading the 1975 Republic Day Parade. Hence, the post is MISLEADING.\n\nWhen the photo of Kiran Bedi with Indira Gandhi was run through Google Reverse Image Search, it was found in Kiran Bedi\u2019s tweet posted during the anniversary of Indira Gandhi in 2018.\n\nOn further searching for any news regarding issuing a challan to Indira Gandhi\u2019s car by Kiran Bedi during any election campaign, no such incident was reported to have been taken place. One incident involving Indira Gandhi and Bedi was that the car of PMO was towed for parking in a restricted area. Bedi was the DCP of Delhi Police during that time. Even Kiran Bedi clarified the same in her latest tweet on April 22,2019. While the car towing incident happened in 1982, the photo was taken in 1975.\n\nFinally, an old photo of Kiran Bedi with Indira Gandhi is being circulated with false claims.", "lang": "en"}
