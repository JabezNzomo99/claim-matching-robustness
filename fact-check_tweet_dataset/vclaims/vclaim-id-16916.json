To close that gap and beat her outright, the simple numbers say Sanders has to win about 65 percent of the remaining delegates.\n\nThe host of CBS News\u2019 Face the Nation, John Dickerson, pressed Sanders on his odds of pulling that off.\n\n\"To get there, many analysts who look at the pledged delegates just say, it's mathematically impossible,\" Dickerson said on May 1, 2016. \"Are they wrong?\"\n\n\"It's difficult,\" Sanders said. \"It's not impossible.\"\n\nSo is it possible? Or impossible?\n\nThe current pledged delegate count, according to , is Clinton 1,641, Sanders 1320. If you add in the superdelegates, it\u2019s 2,151 and 1,361.\n\nSeasoned primary watcher Alan Abramowitz at Emory University said Sanders had a point -- albeit, a limited one.\n\n\"Of course it\u2019s mathematically possible for him to win 65 percent of the remaining pledged delegates,\" Abramowitz said, \"But the probability of that actually happening is near zero.\"\n\nOne way of gauging Sanders\u2019 odds is to look at how many times he hit the 65-percent mark since the first contests in February.\n\n\"He has won that large a share of the delegates in a few caucus states,\" Abramowitz said. \"But he has never done it in a primary state other than Vermont, although he came close in New Hampshire.\"\n\nThe Sanders campaign sent us their count of pledged delegates. By their reckoning, he needs 64.17 percent of the remaining delegates available. This is pledged delegates, not the super delegates who are free to throw their support behind whomever they want. (The count can vary, but right now, Clinton has about 510 super delegates to Sanders\u2019 40, according to .)\n\nUnder Democratic Party rules, the pledged delegates are divided proportionately to the number of votes each candidate gets. That means there are no winner-take-all contests as there are on the Republican side. Using numbers from the Sanders campaign, we compared the number of contests where Sanders has taken at least 64 percent of the vote to the ones when he didn\u2019t. (We rounded down for fairness.)\n\nThis table show why analysts give him long odds:\n\nSanders has crested the 64 percent mark on nine occasions, or about 20 percent of the time.\n\nFor those who say that a 20 percent chance is tough but doable, Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Larry Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, reminds us that not all primaries are equal.\n\n\"Sure, Sanders could win California, the biggest prize remaining, but by enough to capture 65 percent of its delegates?\" Kondik asked. \"Nothing is impossible, but there\u2019s absolutely no reason to think he could do that. Additionally, is Sanders really going to win New Jersey, a mid-Atlantic state, after Clinton generally dominated him in that region? Again, very, very doubtful.\"\n\nAbramowitz said the numbers don\u2019t give Sanders any room for error.\n\n\"Even if Sanders does better than expected in the remaining states, he would only slightly reduce Clinton\u2019s pledged delegate advantage,\" he said.\n\nBoth experts told us that the Democratic Party rule of awarding delegates proportionately makes it very difficult for Sanders to gain much ground.\n\nClinton\u2019s strength among the super delegates, and her overall lead of about 3 million votes, further weigh him down.\n\nSanders said it is not impossible for him to surge past Clinton. The experts we reached agreed. Mathematically, it is not impossible.\n\nOutside the realm of theory, however, his performance in past contests shows it is far more likely that he won\u2019t hit the winning percentage he needs. The proportional allocation rule works against Sanders, leaving him no room to fall short.\n\nSanders' claim is accurate with a major caveat. We rate the claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
