His theory of general relativity, put forward in 1915, dealt with gravity and the distortion of space-time.\n\nThroughout his career, Einstein published many scientific papers and multiple books. However, The Daily Caller could not find the quote anywhere in his collected works. (RELATED: Did Einstein Say That Technology Would Create A \u2018Generation Of Idiots\u2019?)\n\nIt does appear in \u201cThe Ultimate Quotable Einstein,\u201d a compilation of Einstein quotes published by Princeton University Press, where it falls under the \u201cmisattributed\u201d section. The book cites Rita Mae Brown\u2019s 1983 book \u201cSudden Death\u201d as the source of the quote. Brown credits one of the book\u2019s characters with saying the well-known phrase.\n\nThis quote may have actually originated with a Narcotics Anonymous pamphlet two years earlier, according to the website Quote Investigator. Printed in 1981, the pamphlet offers a slightly different version of the saying: \u201cInsanity is repeating the same mistakes and expecting different results.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
