This particular Facebook post credits the president on Aug. 12 with saying, \u201cIf you elect Joe Biden, I will go to prison.\u201d\n\nBut there is no record of Trump making the remark. Had he admitted such a thing, media outlets would have assuredly reported on it, yet none have. A search of Trump\u2019s verified Twitter accounts \u2013 @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS \u2013 turned up no instances of the comment. It does not appear in ProPublica\u2019s archive of the president\u2019s deleted tweets.\n\nCheck Your Fact also didn\u2019t find the quote in Factbase, an online database that collects Trump\u2019s public statements, or the transcripts from his public remarks on Aug. 12, the day he allegedly made the comment.

Trump held a virtual Pennsylvania tele-rally that day, but did not make any mention of going to prison if Biden was elected, according to a transcript from the event. In the comments of the Aug. 2 tweet, the Twitter user clarified that it was \u201csatire.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
