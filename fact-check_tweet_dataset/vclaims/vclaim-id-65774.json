Maxine Waters, two Democrats who have collectively served as Members of the U.S. House of Representatives from California for over 60 years, are probably among the least likely people in the world to be supporting President Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection bid.\n\nNonetheless, an image widely circulated via social media seemingly shows the two women posing below a \u201cTrump 2020\u201d campaign sign:\n\nIn fact, these longtime House members did not pose under such a sign, inadvertently or otherwise \u2014 this was a manipulated image into which the Trump campaign sign had been digitally added.
