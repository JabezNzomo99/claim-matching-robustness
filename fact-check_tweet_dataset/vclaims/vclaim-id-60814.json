The political jabbing is already underway in the Montana Senate race to replace Sen. Max Baucus, a Democrat, who won\u2019t run again.\n\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee attacked Rep. Steve Daines, R-Mont., the state\u2019s only House member and a likely contender for Baucus\u2019 seat.\n\n\"Daines is irresponsibly doing everything he can to make sure the reckless Republican government shutdown continues no matter how dire the consequences are for Montana,\" the . \"In fact, Daines is so thoroughly wedded to his partisan political shutdown that he opposes a vote on his own legislation that he proposed just a few months ago.\"\n\nIn this fact-check, we\u2019ll look at whether Daines actually opposed a vote on a bill he introduced.\n\nWe contacted the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and spokesman Justin Barasky noted that back in March, Daines cosponsored a bill called the . The gist of the measure, endorsed by 16 Republicans and no Democrats, is that if the parties couldn\u2019t come to terms, government agencies could stay open, funded at the same level they are today. If four months went by and there was still no deal, agencies would absorb a 1 percent cut, and that would be repeated every three months until a more durable bill passed.\n\nHouse Democrats are circulating a petition that would force an immediate vote by the full House on the bill. Known as a discharge petition, it would override House leadership and for that reason, it is an unusual move that reflects a breakdown of party control.\n\nDaines will not sign the petition, not that his Democratic colleagues invited him to. They representatives, asking them to join the effort, and Daines was not on that list.\n\nThe discharge petition is no ordinary parliamentary tactic. A petition of this sort succeeds only when the speaker\u2019s hold on his own party has failed.\n\nIn the view of the Democrats, Daines has failed to do all he could to put his legislation to a vote. But the real story is more complicated.\n\nIf the Democrats got the 218 votes they needed, presumably 200 Democrats and 18 Republicans, the would lead to an immediate floor vote on an amendment to strip the original language from the bill and replace it with Democratic version that simply funds the government at current levels. The parts about automatic spending decreases would be gone. If that amendment failed, the bill would go back to the House Appropriations Committee and there would be no vote by the full House on the original measure.\n\nSo the discharge petition forces a vote on a substitute for Daines' bill; it doesn't force a vote on the original bill text itself.\n\nAlee Lockman, Daines\u2019 communications director, said he won\u2019t sign because what would emerge wouldn\u2019t be his bill.\n\n\"The bill my boss cosponsored and the bill that would result through the Democrats\u2019 discharge petition would not be the same,\" Lockman said.\n\nWe contacted the office of another cosponsor of the bill, chair of the House Budget Committee Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. His spokesman said for the same reason, he also had no plans to sign the petition.\n\nIndependent analysts agree that Daines would not have the chance to vote on the measure he introduced.\n\nDonald Wolfensberger, an expert on House parliamentary procedure at the Wilson Center in Washington with long ties to the Republican party, affirmed that the Democratic measure \"completely replaces the base text.\"\n\nSarah Binder, a Brookings Institution fellow and professor of political science at George Washington University, said the Democrats\u2019 petition leaves little room for what Daines had in mind.\n\n\"I think we're talking about two different measures, and thus refusing to sign the discharge petition on the resolution does not signal a member's unwillingness to vote for a bill that she or he cosponsored.\"\n\nBy Binder\u2019s count, 407 discharge petitions have been filed since the end of WWII. Only 2 percent were successful. If you include instances when the threat of a petition forced House leaders to charge course, the track record rises but still only to 9 percent.\n\nResearchers Susan Miller and Marvin Overby at the University of Missouri looked at a dozen years of recent congressional activity, and their results tell us that Daines has a lot of company in refusing to sign a discharge petition for a bill he introduced. Miller and Overby found that when the sponsor or cosponsor comes from the party in power, they refuse to sign about 80 percent of the time.\n\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said Daines opposes a vote on legislation he introduced. Democrats are seeking House members to sign a discharge petition to bring the legislation Daines introduced for a vote, and Daines won\u2019t sign.\n\nHowever, the Democratic move would take away all the relevant text of the original bill, replace it with new language, leaving in place only the original bill number. Independent experts said that Daines would be voting on a measure that is substantially different from the one he put his name to in March.", "lang": "en"}
