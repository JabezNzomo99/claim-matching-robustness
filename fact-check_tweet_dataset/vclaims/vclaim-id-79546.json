Its story said 36 of nearly 1,800 workers at the White House and its agencies owed taxes, though again there was no detailed breakdown.\n\nTo our inquiry, a Washington, D.C.-based IRS spokesman, Bruce Friedland, emailed the relevant agency presenting the number of delinquent workers and retirees for about 100 federal agencies.\n\nAccording to the chart, that $3.3 billion owed was a slight decrease from the $3.38 billion owed by federal workers and retirees a year earlier. The share of delinquent workers and retirees inched up from 3.2 percent to nearly 3.3 percent of all people in those categories, based on 318,462 of nearly 9.8 million total retirees and employees, the chart says.\n\nThen again, federal workers and retirees appear to be less widely delinquent than taxpayers in general. The AP story said the IRS estimates at least 8.7 percent of all taxpayers are delinquent.\n\nSullivan, nudged about this aspect, emailed: \"So what?... Federal employees should owe zero.\"\n\nSullivan tweeted: \"From the \u2018Do As I Say Not As I Do\u2019 department: federal employees owe $3.3 billion in back taxes.\"\n\nThat dollar total is correct, though this message didn\u2019t acknowledge that the 3-plus percent of delinquent federal employees and retirees compares to nearly 9 percent of taxpayers in general. Basically, fewer federal employees fail to pony up on time.\n\nWe rate this claim, which lacks this clarifying information, as Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\n\nClick here for on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
