It is the number one cause of accidental or preventable death in Wisconsin. It surpassed traffic crashes quite a few years ago already.\"\n\nIs it true that overdoses from heroin or prescription opioids not only outnumber traffic fatalities, but are the top cause of accidental deaths in Wisconsin?\n\nThe from the U.S.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that nationally, there were 41,340 fatal drug overdoses of all types in 2011, making it the leading cause of injury death in the country.\n\nBut what about in Wisconsin? When we asked Schimel\u2019s campaign about his claim, Schimel replied in an email that he had misspoken.\n\nHe told us he meant to say that the number of all drug overdose deaths in Wisconsin -- not just heroin and prescription opioid deaths -- exceed the number of motor vehicle deaths and are the top cause of accidental deaths.\n\nWe checked from the state Department of Health Services, which said there were 2,789 accidental deaths in 2012.\n\nThe leading cause was 1,091 falls (which also was the leading cause in 2011, the department).\n\nThe same number of deaths -- 615-- was caused by \"accidental poisoning and exposure to noxious substances.\"\n\nBut those 615 included deaths caused by a variety of drugs, as well as other substances such as alcohol.\n\nSeparately, we obtained figures from the health department showing there were 511 opioid deaths in Wisconsin in 2012.\n\nThat included 187 heroin deaths, up from 27 in 2002. And there were 324 deaths caused either by prescription opioids or a mix of prescription opioids and heroin, up from 144 in 2002.\n\nSchimel said heroin and prescription opioidss are \"the number one cause of accidental or preventable death in Wisconsin.\"\n\nSchimel acknowledged to us that he misspoke and in fact opioid deaths are down the list. The latest figures, for 2012, show falls was the leading causes of accidental death in Wisconsin. Tied for second were motor vehicle deaths and drug overdose of all types -- including 511 deaths from heroin or prescription opioids.", "lang": "en"}
