Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is falsely taking credit when the real work was done by other lawmakers.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2016-01-18T19:12:16Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-82756", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/12/23/rubios-inaccurate-claim-that-he-inserted-a-provision-restricting-obamacare-bailout-funds/", "vclaim": "Indeed, the second part of the voiceover in the Super PAC ad comes directly from a New York Times article that, in its first sentence, said that Rubio had \u201cslipped into a giant spending bill\u201d in 2014 a \u201clittle-noticed health care provision\u201d that had undermined confidence in Obamacare. The ad quotes other news reports as well.\n\nAt issue is something called \u201crisk corridors\u201d \u2014 a provision of the massive law that was intended to protect insurance companies from losses if they did not properly estimate premiums in the initial three years of the law. Companies that estimated correctly \u2014 and had what were deemed as excess profits \u2014 would pay fees to help underwrite at least some of the cost of helping the insurance companies that had stumbled.\n\nWhile some health-care experts say risk corridors are an important feature to smooth out the transition to the new law, Republicans opposed such payments as a bailout for poorly run insurance companies \u2014 or ones that deliberately underpriced their products, knowing they would get government funds. Rubio in 2013 introduced a bill to eliminate the provision, but like other Obamacare repeal efforts, his proposal went nowhere.\n\nBut a House probe that year actually suggested claims would exceed payments. Meanwhile, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), then ranking member of the Budget Committee, and Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, came up with a new strategy of attacking the legality of the payments. They also enlisted the help of then-Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.), who chaired the appropriations panel that funds the Department of Health and Human Services and the Labor Department.\n\nThe lawmakers questioned whether the payments were actually appropriated correctly \u2014 forcing the administration to make changes that ultimately allowed the lawmakers to checkmate the administration. In effect, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) was forced to admit that the ACA did not automatically appropriate the funds, but it was subject to discretion of Congress. (A Government Accountability Office opinion requested by Sessions and Upton backed up much of the GOP contention.)\n\nSo the administration, which had asserted that the risk-corridor funds came from mandatory spending, designated the money as discretionary. Officials made a number of other changes, such as classifying the payments as \u201cuser fees,\u201d in an effort retain the authority to spend the money. But if collections fell short, as Republicans expected, then the administration would need approval for the money from Congress.\n\nKingston says the conference negotiation consisted of basically him and his Senate counterpart, then-Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa). \u201cI think it was not seen as a big issue,\u201d Kingston said. \u201cHe had won on so many things,\u201d particularly on labor issues. So Kingston offered up a health-care request. \u201cPart of these negotiations is you don\u2019t get everything you wanted.\u201d\n\nIn arguing that Rubio had a key role, his supporters have pointed to an Oct. 2014 letter that Rubio and other GOP senators sent to then-House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) \u2014 it also was signed by Sessions and Rubio\u2019s presidential rival, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas \u2014 urging that risk-corridor payments be limited in the spending bill. But it appears to have been mostly a public-relations exercise. \u201cI didn\u2019t see it, and it didn\u2019t influence me,\u201d Kingston said.\n\n\u201cThe Senate Budget Committee Republican Staff, along with Chairman Upton and his determined staff, exposed a fatal flaw in the risk corridors and then together developed and implemented a months-long multi-step strategy for stopping HHS from executing an illegal bailout. In particular, Mr. Winfree \u2014 a key member of my Budget Committee staff at the time \u2014 deserves credit for his crucial role in uncovering this fatal flaw and then implementing with my staff and a sophisticated plan for blocking the bailout, working with the office of Congressman Kingston. The essential feature of our joint approach was that it did not require the passage of a standalone bill, but \u2014 through establishing that the Risk Corridor lacked an appropriation \u2014 laying the groundwork for successfully blocking the illicit transfer of funds in the budget bill.\u201d\n\nSuccess always has many fathers, but Rubio goes way too far in claiming credit here. He raised initial concerns about the risk-corridor provision, but the winning legislative strategy was executed by other lawmakers. He certainly had a more central role in the immigration bill from which he has distanced himself \u2014 which may be a reason he is trying to elevate his role in this case.", "lang": "en"}
