But astute readers should be able to figure out the Four-Pinocchio whoppers. These claims are examined in the order in which they were uttered.\n\nThis curious statement appears to be based on unconfirmed reports that the Islamic State is operating a luxury hotel in Mosul, Iraq. There are images and articles of the multi-story hotel apparently circulating on social media accounts affiliated with the group. But even if this report were confirmed, it is difficult to imagine it would be in any competition with Trump\u2019s numerous hotels.\n\nThe GDP did shrink in first quarter 2015 by a 0.7 percent annual rate. But Trump is simply wrong when he asserts \u201cit\u2019s never below zero.\u201d After all, two negative quarters in a row is a standard indicator for an economic recession. First quarter GDPs also are tied to unusual winter weather that can hurt certain industries. Bureau of Economic Analysis data show that since the second quarter of 1947, there have been at least 40 quarters when the GDP shrank.\n\n\u201cWe have a disaster called the big lie: Obamacare. Yesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof. You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it\u2019s virtually useless.\u201d\n\nTrump overstates the case here. Deductibles have been going up, especially as employers shift more costs to employees even as growth in overall health costs has really slowed. As for costs, Trump appears to be talking about premium increases. Currently, insurance companies are proposing increases, and at least one has topped 50 percent. But that does not mean that state regulators will ultimately approve the proposals. Premiums increased by an average of about 5 percent in 2015, but rate increases generally are expected to be higher in 2016.\n\nActually, HealthCare.gov cost about $700 million. But you can get to $5 billion if you add in the cost of the various state health-care exchanges \u2014 some of which work poorly \u2014 and if you add in the federal assistance for the state exchanges.\n\nTrump is close on China, as the Treasury Department says China\u2019s holdings are $1.263 trillion as of April. (There is some suspicion that much of Belgium\u2019s $228 billion in debt is being held on behalf of China, so the figure is actually even higher.) But Japan trails China, with $1.216 trillion. It\u2019s also important to remember that foreign holdings of U.S. debt actually amount to less than 50 percent of the total U.S. debt.\n\nThe common international measure for education performance is the Program for International Student Assessment, of 15-year-old students\u2019 reading, math and science performance. The latest report from 2012 showed the United States ranked between 24th and 36th in the three measures behind industrialized countries and regions (i.e., not \u201cThird World\u201d countries). The United States fared better in another international measure, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, ranking within top six to 13 industrialized countries or regions in 4th and 8th grade scores.\n\nThe Fact Checker has learned from long experience never to trust Trump\u2019s numbers when he talks about his wealth. Our colleague Allan Sloan dissected Trump\u2019s claim of $9 billion in assets and found it wanting for six key reasons. As Sloan put it: \u201cTrump\u2019s balance sheet is certainly over-inflated and doesn\u2019t seem to be tethered to much of a financial reality\u2026. If he had presented this balance sheet to me in a personal finance class, I\u2019d have given him a short message: \u2018You\u2019re fired.\u2019\u201d", "lang": "en"}
