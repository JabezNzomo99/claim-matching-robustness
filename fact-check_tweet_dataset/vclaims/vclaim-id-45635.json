No, that's not true: Investigators have not made their findings public because the case is ongoing. Whether or not the bill was counterfeit has little to do with the investigation since Floyd is dead and cannot be charged. It also is not a factor in the case against the four police officers charged in his death.\n\nThe claim appeared in a meme, including in a post (archived here) shared on Facebook on June 2, 2020, which featured a photo of the owner of Cup Foods, the Minneapolis store where Floyd used the alleged fake $20 to buy cigarettes. It read:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nThe meme also made the false claim that it was store owner Mahmoud Abumayyaleh who called police on Floyd:\n\nWhile investigators are not addressing details about the purported counterfiet bill, many details are known of what happened before Floyd died under the knee of a police officer who responded to the call. The charging documents and media interviews revealed that it was a teenaged clerk who made the 911 call to report that a man had just passed a fake $20. It was not the Abumayyaleh, who owns the neighborhood grocery with his brothers.\n\nAn article on TheCut.com, titled 'If I Would Have Been Here, George Floyd May Still Be Alive', features an interview with the store owner:\n\nAbumayyaleh knew Floyd, calling him a \"big teddy bear\" who would come to Cup Foods a few times a week to pay his cell phone bill, and said that they always got along. But that fatal night, a few of his younger employees with less experience were working. Abumayyaleh wishes he had been in the store to speak with Floyd himself. \"If I would have been here the authorities would not have been called,\" he said. \"George Floyd may still be alive.\"\n\nThe New York Times published a story titled What Happened in the Chaotic Moments Before George Floyd Died detailed the moments just after the teen clerk called police to report the fake bill:\n\nThe claim that the \"bill was real\" and Floyd \"was found to be innocent\" is unsupported by what we know. The claim that Cup Foods owner Mahmoud Abumayyaleh is the person who called police on Floyd is clearly false.", "lang": "en"}
