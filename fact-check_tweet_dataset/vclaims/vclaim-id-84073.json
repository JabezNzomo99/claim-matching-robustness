Here\u2019s the original text of the TOI blog => http://archive.is/Xge6M.\n\nA blog titled \u201cNostradamus and India\u201d has been published on the Times of India website on March 28, 2017. Francois Gautier, the author of this blog, claims to have chanced upon some hidden manuscripts according to which Nostradamus predicted that a supreme leader will be born in the state of Gujarat and his first name would be Narendrus (Narendra). Fracois Gautier claims that these manuscripts were discovered in 2012. He writes:\n\nIn 2012, French scholar and Nostradamus specialist, Bamprelle de la Rochefoucault, discovered in an old trunk bought two hundred euros to an antiques dealer, old manuscripts which have been analyzed and found to be of the 15th century. There are quite a few stanzas devoted to India, which is named here as Indicus in Latin and Indes in old French.\n\nSo, in 2012, some Nostradamus specialist discovered an old trunk which had these magical pronouncements. The only problem with this claim is that in the 51st volume of RSS weekly magazine Organiser published in 1999, it is claimed that \u201can old trunk\u201d was discovered just last month by \u201chopeless hinduphile Francois Gautier\u201d and according to the manuscripts, it was Nostradamus who had founded RSS 400 years ago.\n\nIn fact, the \u201cold trunk\u201d has been found at least two times in the books that Francois Gautier has himself authored according to a search on Google Books.\n\nThe \u201cold trunk\u201d was found in the \u201clast month\u201d in his 2001 book titled \u201cA Western Journalist on India\u201d and the 2003 book titled \u201cRewriting Indian history\u201c.\n\nIn fact, Francois Gautier has discovered the \u201cold trunk\u201d so many times over that it is difficult to keep track. He discovered it in his 2009 blog titled \u201cNostradamus and Saffron\u201d. And then again in his 2014 blog titled \u201cNostradamus and 2014\u201d elections. And the latest discovery of the \u201cold trunk\u201d happened on March 28, 2017 on the TOI blog. In fact, everytime Mr Gautier discovers this old trunk, the contents inside the trunk seem to change magically. The Nostradamus predictions coming out of this same \u201cold trunk\u201d vary from Nostradamus actually having founded RSS to Narendra Modi, the supreme leader of India, being born in Gujarat.\n\nBe that as it may, let us also look at some of the passages that Mr Gautier has posted in the TOI article. One of the passages according to Mr Gautier relates to a possibility of an Indo-Pakistan nuclear war. The following is the passage quoted in the TOI article.\n\nAs it turns out, a quick google search is all that was needed to establish that this passage posted in TOI is a modified version and not original. The word \u201cIndes\u201d signifying India is not in the original passage and was a creation of Mr Gautier\u2019s mind.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the next passage posted by Mr Gautier in the TOI blog.\n\nDeux mil quatorze verra regner les Hindoos,\n\n De ciel & terre tenir la Monarchie,\n\n D\u2019Asie forces nul ne verra peries,\u201cHindus will reign from 2014 onwards\n\n They will rule heaven and earth\n\n Nobody will resist them in Asia\u201d\n\nYet another quick google search again tells us that even this passage has been modified from its original version. The original passage has the word \u201cHesperies\u201d instead of \u201cHindoos\u201d.\n\nOne can see how Mr Gautier\u2019s writings are purely a figment of his imagination and has got nothing to do with reality. He takes content from one place, changes a couple of words and prolaims a new prophecy by Nostradamus, one which has been found from that same \u201cold trunk\u201d that he has discovered multiple times in the last 18 years. Let\u2019s look at the next passage.\n\nIndus supremus gudjaratus status natus est\n\n Patrus Theus boutiqus, studium bonus est\n\n Namusprimum narendus est\u201cThe supreme leader of India will be born in the state of Gujarat\n\n His father will sell tea in a shop\n\n His first name will be narendus (Narendra)\u201d\n\nNow a google search would reveal that an equivalent of this passage is not available on the Internet, not documented anywhere, even in parts. But, Mr Gautier being Mr Gautier, he always leaves a few gaping holes. In a 2014 blog on his own website, he claims:\n\nNext, another prophecy: \u201cPoliticus Bharatus Janatus Indicus tri pillarus est, Vajpayum, Advanum persistum est et Narendrum Modum. Vajpayum emergum est\u2026\u201d The BJP will have three pillars: AB Vajpayee, LK Advani and Narendra Modi. Eventually, Vajpayee will no longer have an active life, Advani will persist and Narendra Modi will be emerging.\n\nIn 2014, Nostradamus used to like to call Narendra Modi as \u201cNarendrum Modum\u201d and in 2017 he likes to call PM Modi as \u201cnarendrus\u201d. It doesn\u2019t end there. In 2014, he claimed that Vajpayee, Advani and Modi will be the pillars. In a 2009 blog on his own website, he had claimed that AB Vajpayee, LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi will be the three pillars. He had written and I quote:\n\nNext, another prophecy: \u201cPoliticus Bharatus Janatus Indicus tri pillarus est, Vajpayum, Advanum et Murlum Joshum Kashmirum drapus levus. Vajpayum maladum est\u2026\u201d The BJP will have three pillars: AB Vajpayee, LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi. As eventually, Vajpayee will no longer have an active life, Advani will become the leader. MM Joshi, who hoisted the Indian flag in Srinagar, will be his number two.\n\nSo, from Murli Manohor Joshi as the pillar in 2009 to Narendra Modi as the pillar in 2014 to Narendra Modi as the supreme leader of India in 2017, Mr Gautier has been conveniently changing the prophecies that come out of that \u201cold trunk\u201d based on the prevalent political climate. Yet, such blatant lies are given space in Indian media outlets without any verification. After the TOI blog, Zee News dutifully published this bit of \u2018news\u2019.", "lang": "en"}
