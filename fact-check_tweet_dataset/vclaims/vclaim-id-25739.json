As you can see, it\u2019s not a mansion, he is not a wealthy man. They destroyed the yard by driving cars on it, threw feces on all the windows, every outside wall was spray painted. How do you explain.\u201d\n\nBut Capt. Paul Liquorie of the Montgomery County Police Department told us in an email that there have been \u201cno reported incidents of vandalism or other crimes\u201d on the block where Kavanaugh lives in Chevy Chase, Maryland, in the last month. The block in question is under the jurisdiction of the department\u2019s 2nd District, which Liquorie commands.\n\nIn fact, the photo of the property in the meme doesn\u2019t even match the house where Kavanaugh lives, which has been shown in press reports.\n\nInstead, we found the photo used is actually of a home in Ontario, Canada, that was vandalized in 2016. The photo was among several featured in a news story about the incident in the Hamilton Spectator.\n\nThe same erroneous claim about Kavanaugh\u2019s home \u2014 and the photo \u2014 was the focus of a story published Sept. 30 on a website belonging to a supposedly satirical publisher, America\u2019s Last Line of Defense. That story also appeared on a website called ABCNews.live \u2014 whose version, lacking any \u201csatire\u201d label, accrued nearly 13,000 engagements on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle data.\n\nThe story claimed the Kavanaughs\u2019 home was in Mayo Lake, Pennsylvania, though there is no such town in the state.\n\nKavanaugh, who has denied the allegations of sexual misconduct that have challenged his nomination, has said he received \u201cvile threats of violence\u201d against his family. Lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford, the California professor and accuser who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, have said their client has received death threats.\n\nBut the viral claim of massive vandalism at Kavanaugh\u2019s home is a hoax.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.", "lang": "en"}
