The incoming/interim Congress President (Motilal Vora \u2013 90 years )bends before the Prince in reverence. No respect for age and culture. Absolutely disgusting\u201d, tweeted @lakshmisv along with a photograph. In the image, an unidentified man can be seen touching the feet of Rahul Gandhi. This picture has been shared by several users on Facebook and Twitter. The image started doings the rounds after certain journalists claimed on social media that Motilal Vohra could be the interim president of Indian National Congress after the resignation of Rahul Gandhi.\n\nSome followers requested Alt News for verification of this image.\n\nBollywood actress Koena Mitra and Swarajya columnist Shefali Vaidya had also posted an identical claim and later deleted their tweets.\n\n\n\nOn reverse searching the image on Google. Alt News found that the leader seen in the image is NOT Motilal Vora but senior Congress leader TS Singh Deo. This image earlier went viral in December 2018 when social media users claimed that Deo was touching Rahul Gandhi\u2019s feet after taking oath as the cabinet minister in the newly formed Congress government in Chattisgarh.\n\nConsequentially, the picture was fact-checked by several media outlets with no unanimous certainty that TS Singh Deo touched Rahul Gandhi\u2019s feet. Speaking to India Today, TS Singh Deo had given contradictory statements on the issue. Moreover, a senior Congress leader RPN Singh, who was present at the spot, said that Deo tried to touch Rahul\u2019s feet at the entrance but the Congress chief stopped him midway.\n\nAn old photo where TS Singh Deo is claimed to be touching Rahul Gandhi\u2019s feet was circulated as that of Congress leader Motilal Vora.", "lang": "en"}
