In the image, the division of Uttar Pradesh into three distinct regions is shown, and the capitals of the new states and the districts have also been mentioned. It has been claimed that UP will be trifurcated. The first state will be UP with Lucknow as its capital. The second state will be Bundelkhand, whose capital will be Prayagraj. The third state will be Purvanchal with Gorakhpur as its capital.\n\nThis claim has been tweeted by a user named Suraj Vishwakarma, who claims to be a reporter.\n\nThis claim has gone viral on Twitter and Facebook. It has also been shared by the Facebook page Saharanpur News.\n\nThe same has been published on Crime Journalist, a web portal.\n\nIn order to ascertain this claim, Alt News searched with relevant keywords but found no news report referring to the proposal to trifurcate Uttar Pradesh. Had such a proposal indeed been accepted, it would certainly have been reported by all prominent media organisations.\n\nThe proposal to split Uttar Pradesh into multiple states first came into prominence in 2011, when the BSP government in UP had passed a resolution in the state assembly in favour of a division of the state, and forwarded the proposal to the Central government for consideration. However, this proposal was not given the green signal by the UPA government. The issue had been raised in 2013 as well.\n\nThe issue of trifurcation of UP keeps cropping up at regular intervals. In 2017, the issue was proposed once again by Mayawati. She had pledged the division of UP if BSP were to come to power in the state.\n\nThe Lallantop spoke to Mrityunjay Kumar, media advisor to the UP government, who dismissed this claim and said, \u201cThere is no proposal to split UP. There is no proposal for the same either in front of the Yogi Adityanath govt. The claims circulating on social media are false. The government is concerned with the progress of the entire region. No region is being discriminated against. In such a scenario, it is meaningless to give importance to such demands.\u201d (translated from Hindi).\n\nThere are no media reports and no proposal for the government regarding the division of Uttar Pradesh into multiple states. The claim circulating on social media is false.", "lang": "en"}
