Local officials from Kathua, Jammu and Kashmir where the incident was recorded, dismissed all such 'ghostly' claims and called the incident, a \"case of mass hysteria\".\n\nThe two videos are being shared with a caption that reads 'Students of a primary school in Safidon (Haryana) have been possessed by spirits. The entire city is living in the shadows of fear'.\n\nThe video has been shared from several individual Facebook profiles with similar claims that there is supernatural angle to the incident.\n\nA comment on one of the viral video stated that the clip was from Kathua in Jammu and Kashmir and not Haryana. BOOM then searched the internet with keywords 'Kathua school girls' and found several news reports carrying photos that matched the video, with details about the incident.\n\nThe incident was first reported on June 13 at the Sitti village government high school of Bani tehsil in Kathua district.

Two students, who might have been emotionally weak, started this and several others followed suit. And then, a teacher recorded the incident on mobile phone and shared it,\" Jasotia said.\n\nThe SDM further dimissed all claims about a supernatural angle, terming it a case of \"mass hysteria\".\n\nHe said, \"No, there is no supernatural angle here. We have strictly told the students that only those who want to study should come to school otherwise they will be handed their tranfer certificates.\"", "lang": "en"}
