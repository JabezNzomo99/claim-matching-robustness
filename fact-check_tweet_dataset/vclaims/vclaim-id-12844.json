Clinton was accused of repeatedly lying under oath to a grand jury, in his civil deposition, and even to his own lawyer, investigators found. Clinton abused his constitutional authority by lying to the public and Congress throughout 1998, and tried to obstruct justice, investigators found.\n\nQ: Did you have an extramarital sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky? Q: If she told someone that she had a sexual affair with you beginning in November of 1995, would that be a lie? WJC: It\u2019s certainly not the truth. It would not be the truth. Q: I think I used the term \u201csexual affair.\u201d And so the record is completely clear, have you ever had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, as that term is defined in Deposition Exhibit 1, as modified by the Court? Mr. Bennett: I object because I don\u2019t know that he can remember \u2014 Judge Wright: Well, it\u2019s real short. He can \u2014 I will permit the question and you may show the witness definition number one. WJC: I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. I\u2019ve never had an affair with her. President Clinton reiterated his denial under questioning by his own attorney: Q: In paragraph eight of [Ms. Lewinsky\u2019s] affidavit, she says this, \u201cI have never had a sexual relationship with the President, he did not propose that we have a sexual relationship, he did not offer me employment or other benefits in exchange for a sexual relationship, he did not deny me employment or other benefits for rejecting a sexual relationship.\u201d Is that a true and accurate statement as far as you know it?\n\nSen. Al Franken (D-Minn.): \u201cCNN has just published a story, and I\u2019m telling you this about a news story that has just been published, so I\u2019m not expecting you to know whether or not it\u2019s true or not, but CNN just published a story alleging that the intelligence community provided documents to the president-elect last week that included information that \u2018Russian operatives claimed to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump.\u2019 These documents also allegedly say \u2018There was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government.\u2019 Now again I am telling you this as it\u2019s coming out so, ah, you know. But if it\u2019s true it\u2019s obviously extremely serious, and if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign what will you do?\u201d Sessions: \u201cSenator Franken, I am not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign, and I did not have communications with the Russians, and I am unable to comment on it.\u201d\n\nSessions was not asked whether he, as a campaign surrogate, communicated with the Russian government. Franken asked what Sessions would do if the CNN report turned out to be true and there was \u201cany evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government.\u201d Sessions says in general that he is not aware of such communications. Then he gives a caveat that he was called to be a surrogate, and did not have communications with Russia.\n\nAfter the event at RNC, a small group of ambassadors (including Kislyak) approached Sessions, The Post reported: \u201cSessions then spoke individually to some of the ambassadors, including Kislyak, the official said. In the informal exchanges, the ambassadors expressed appreciation for his remarks and some of them invited him to events they were sponsoring, said the official, citing a former Sessions staffer who was at the event.\u201d\n\nSo did Sessions intentionally mislead senators by saying he, as a campaign surrogate, did not communicate with Russia? Or was he simply saying he was unaware of evidence to support CNN\u2019s report? Why didn\u2019t Sessions disclose to Franken or Leahy that he had spoken twice to the Russian ambassador during the campaign, in his capacity as a member of the Armed Services Committee? It remains unclear.\n\nWhile the Sessions and Clinton cases both involve statements made under oath, the circumstances are vastly different. (Pelosi may be better off comparing Sessions\u2019s case to that of Richard G. Kleindienst, former acting attorney general in 1972.) If one were to weigh Pelosi\u2019s claim based on whether Sessions and Clinton lied under oath, it\u2019s clear Clinton\u2019s case is not \u201cfar less\u201d than Sessions\u2019s. But the content of Clinton\u2019s lies (his sex life) was \u201cfar less\u201d important than the content of Sessions\u2019s statements (about potential foreign influence in U.S. elections). Pelosi\u2019s staff indicated that she was making a distinction between the content of their statements.", "lang": "en"}
