The posts claim the pyramids were lit up with the flag in order to show solidarity with Lebanon after a huge explosion in the port of Beirut in early August 2020. The claim is false; the photo has been doctored to include the Lebanese flag on a photo taken in April 2020.\n\nThe photo was published here on August 5, 2020, by Indonesian news outlet Sindonews.com.\n\nThe photo shows two Egyptian pyramids; one appears to be lit up with a projection of the flag of Lebanon.

The words \u201cEXPERIENCE EGYPT SOON\u201d can be seen projected onto the pyramid on its front side.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison between the misleading image (L) and the photo published on the Facebook page of the ministry (R).
