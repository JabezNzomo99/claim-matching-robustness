Below is a tweet by Maharashtra BJP General Secretary Atul Bhatkhalkar.\n\nRajat Sethi, advisor to Manipur Chief Minister, took a step further and wrote, \u201cWorld leaders Trump, Boris Johnson, Scott Morrison etc want our PM Modi to lead the efforts.\u201d\n\nThe broadcast is viral on Facebook and Twitter alike. Alt News has also received multiple fact-check requests on its official mobile application.\n\nThe clip in question is WION\u2019s March 15, 2020, broadcast titled, \u201cWorld leaders laud PM Modi\u2019s initiative, Australia welcomes PM Modi\u2019s calls for G20 linkup as well.\u201d\n\nIn the broadcast, the anchor does not say that PM Modi has been chosen by the US, UK and 18 other nations to lead a coronavirus task force but India has \u201cemerged\u201d as a leader to take charge of a task force because PM Modi called for a joint action plan between countries to contain the pandemic. \u201cAll SAARC nations welcomed India\u2019s move saying that they want to work closely with New Delhi to chalk out a strategy to combat the deadly disease,\u201d the anchor says. Here, she is specifically talking about member states of SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) \u2013 India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.\n\nAs far as other parts of the world are concerned, here\u2019s what the anchor said: \u201cPraises were not limited to South Asia but leaders from other parts of the world also reached out to Prime Minister Modi. Among the firsts was British Prime Minister Boris Johnson who discussed coordinated international efforts to tackle the outbreak with Modi. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison lauded Prime Minister Modi\u2019s efforts to organise a G20 link up.\u201d It is noteworthy that the United States did not find a mention throughout the length of the show.\n\nIt could be argued that the reportage borderlines hyperbole, however, nowhere does the anchor claim that PM Modi has been selected to lead a global task force on COVID-19 crisis. She spoke of the interactions the Prime Minister had with world leaders.\n\nWION is an Indian news channel covering global affairs. It is owned by Zee Media. Its editor-in-chief is Sudhir Chaudhary, who is also the editorial head at Zee News.\n\nWhat global initiatives has India undertaken to tackle coronavirus pandemic?\n\nOn March 13, PM Modi tweeted, \u201cI would like to propose that the leadership of SAARC nations chalk out a strong strategy to fight Coronavirus.\u201d\n\nThe first-ever video conference between SAARC leaders was held on March 15, where PM Modi extended $10 million as India\u2019s contribution to a COVID-19 emergency fund. Other nations such as Sri Lanka and Bangladesh pledged $5 million and $1.5 million respectively. Pakistan is the only nation yet to announce any contribution to the fund. Pakistan has demanded that the fund should be placed under the General Secretary of the South Asian grouping.\n\nWION further referred to G20 while reporting that Australian PM Morrison lauded PM Modi\u2019s efforts to link-up a G20 effort. The channel subsequently played Morrison\u2019s address where he commended the Indian Prime Minister\u2019s proposal but said that the matter can be decided by the Saudi government, the President of the G20 this year. A G20 virtual summit was held on March 26. It was chaired by the King of Saudi Arabia and attended by leaders of the member states, including PM Modi. G20 nations pledged a combined sum of $5 trillion to tackle the social and economic impacts of the crisis. PM Modi neither led the G20 conference nor has India made a separate contribution.\n\nThe United Kingdom has also not proposed that India heads a task force. PM Modi and his British counterpart had a telephonic conversation on March 12. As per the PMO press release, the two leaders spoke about India-UK cooperation in the field of climate change and \u201cexchanged views on COVID-19 epidemic\u201d. India is also in talks with the United States to find strategies to tackle the crisis however, there are no reports of a joint or a global taskforce.\n\nA WION broadcast is, therefore, circulating with the false claim that the US, UK and 18 other nations want Prime Minister Modi to lead a coronavirus taskforce. There have been no such proposals or initiatives. The channel\u2019s exaggerated narration possibly plated a part in portraying a misleading picture of India\u2019s place in the global effort to tackle the crisis.", "lang": "en"}
