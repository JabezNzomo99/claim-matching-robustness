(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nA reverse-image search led us to a Flickr page that posted the photograph in May 2007 as part of an album for the annual \"Bay to Breakers\" race held in San Francisco. The caption does not name the person in the photo, but reads, \"One of two ladies in vagina costumes.\"\n\nWe reached out to race officials about whether Karlan\u2019s name appeared on that year\u2019s roster, but were told their registration data doesn\u2019t go back that far. We searched news coverage of the event and found no mention of Karlan.\n\nKarlan herself responded to PolitiFact in an email, and said she didn\u2019t attend the race and the photograph is not of her.", "lang": "en"}
