Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claim Hitler held Jews in detention camps for being illegal immigrants. No, that is misleading, and the claim seems to be a new spin on a controversy sparked in Summer 2019 by the liberal New York Congresswoman, who claimed the U.S. government is running concentration camps on the southern border. The site running the story is part of a network of websites known mostly for Islamophobic stories.\n\nThe claim comes from an article (archived here) published in June 2019 by ThePolitics.Online under the title \"US congresswoman says Hitler just held Jews in detention camps for being illegal immigrants\". It opened:\n\nThe story claims AOC, as she is commonly known, \"sparked outrage by comparing Jewish Holocaust survivors to illegal immigrants,\" and that she is comparing the Holocaust survivors to \"illegal immigrants who were just held in detention camps.\"\n\nThe story stems from a comment Ocasio-Cortez made on Twitter:\n\nIn her tweet, she included a link to an Esquire article, in which a concentration camp historian defines the southern border as \"mass detention of civilians without trial.\"\n\nSince making the Twitter comment, the debate over what constitutes a concentration camp - and when should the phrase be invoked - continues to roil experts and the internet. On one hand, there are Jews and some scholars saying it's not appropriate to use the phrase outside the context of the Holocaust, finding the term too emotionally loaded. On the other hand, some people believe that's exactly what is happening on the southern border, where the administration has been detaining illegal immigrants and where President Trump is constructing a wall to halt the flow of illegal people into the U.S.\n\nAOC said in a follow-up Tweet a few days later:\n\nAnd in a subsequent Instagram Q and A with her followers, apparently removed from her page, Ocasio-Cortez said this, according to the talk show \"The View\":\n\nAt no point does AOC claim Hitler held Jews in detention camps for being illegal immigrants, a claim that is also not supported by respected history books. According to historians and experts, Nazi officials began the mass arrests of male Jews throughout Germany in 1938, because they were Jews - and for no other reason.\n\nAccording to The Holocaust Encyclopedia put out by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum:\n\nFrom its rise to power in 1933, the Nazi regime built a series of incarceration sites to imprison and eliminate real and perceived \"enemies of the state.\" Most prisoners in the early concentration camps were political prisoners--German Communists, Socialists, Social Democrats--as well as Roma (Gypsies), Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals, and persons accused of \"asocial\" or socially deviant behavior. Many of these sites were called concentration camps. The term concentration camp refers to a camp in which people are detained or confined, usually under harsh conditions and without regard to legal norms of arrest and imprisonment that are acceptable in a constitutional democracy.\n\nIn the ThePolitics.Online \"About Us\" section, it reads that the site is:\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalists to rank the reliability of websites, describes thepolitics.online as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard, the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
