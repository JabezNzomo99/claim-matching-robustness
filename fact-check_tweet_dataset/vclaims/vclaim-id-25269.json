However, all too often, elected institutions fail to mirror this diversity, reinforcing the stereotype that politics is the reserve of a certain category of people, to the exclusion of others. Women, visible minorities, people with an immigration background, national minorities, young people, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people and persons with disabilities remain under-represented in politics at local, regional, national and European level. This representation gap perpetuates the idea that politics is reserved for a select group, composed mostly of white, heterosexual men over 50.\u201d\n\nAt their most diverse, Russian PACE delegations in past years have included only two women and never members of sexual minorities, those whose sexual orientation, identity or characteristics differ from the majority, who in Russia are constantly subjected to harassment and homophobia.\n\nWhile charges of sexual assault and harassment have brought down the careers of politicians and celebrities in West, and some have even been criminally prosecuted, Slutsky has not suffered such consequences despite multiple sexual harassment accusations made against him. Indeed, Slutsky, along with various higher-ups and colleagues, have simply waved off such accusations.\n\nIn 2014, PACE suspended the Russian delegation\u2019s voting rights over the annexation of Crimea and military interference in eastern Ukraine. Russia\u2019s PACE delegation continues to demand the immediate restoration of full representation while fully supporting the Kremlin\u2019s foreign policy acts.\n\nOn Thursday, January 10, after PACE made public a copy of the letter sent to the Russian parliament, Tolstoy admitted he had made a \u201cgrave mistake\u201d about the number of genders.\n\n\u200b\u201cI repent,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. \u201cThere are, of course, not six, but only two - male and female. All the other individuals are \u2018underrepresented sexes\u2019, genders; that is precisely what is being referred to in the PACE letter \u2026 Where we get them remains to be determined.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
