It is being claimed that the video is shot amidst the Coronavirus pandemic and the men are flouting social distancing norms.\n\nThe caption of the post read: \u201cSocial distances??? Where are the Covid Cops???\ud83d\ude06\u201c\n\nSince some men are wearing skull caps and traditional Muslim dresses, some posts are being shared with a claim that the brawl took place on Eid, which was celebrated on May 25, 2020.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above claim and found it to be FAKE.\n\nWhen we extracted keyframes of the video through InVid and put them through Reverse Image Search, we found a report by a UK tabloid, Mirror, dated August 16, 2019, featuring the same video. The headline of the article read, \u2018Brutal street brawl involving at least 30 people erupts in broad daylight\u2019. According to the report, the incident took place in Birmingham on August 15, 2019, between two feuding families. West Midlands Police said in a statement: \u201cPolice were called to reports of disorder in Prestbury Road, Aston, around 5.30 pm yesterday (15 August)\u201d. The incident is also covered by another UK daily, DailyMail. Read the report here. Hence, the above information proves that the video in question is old and does not have any connection with COVID-19 or flouting of social distancing norms.
