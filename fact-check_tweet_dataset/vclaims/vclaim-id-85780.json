But as we often say, two wrongs don\u2019t make a right.\n\nThat\u2019s right. Buried deep in the House Republican budget blueprint is Section 608, titled \u201cPolicy Statement on Responsible Stewardship of Taxpayer Dollars.\u201d The policy statement included this line: \u201cNo taxpayer funds may be used to purchase first class airfare or to lease corporate jets for Members of Congress.\u201d\n\nThe Republican budget blueprint passed the House by a vote of 219 to 205, with Brownley voting against it. But it was not taken up in the Senate, and even then it would have not had the force of law. (It\u2019s simply a budget resolution.)\n\nLook at the 2012 ad below attacking Rep. Reid J. Ribble (R-Wis.), which was based on the fact that he voted against the Democratic budget blueprint in 2011, which contained this language: \u201cIt is the policy of this resolution that no taxpayer funds may be used to purchase first class airfare or to lease corporate jets for Members of Congress.\u201d\n\nThe attack ad, sponsored by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, is really over the top, featuring images of champagne bottles and starting off with this line: \u201cImagine you could travel first class \u2014 and make taxpayers foot the bill.\u201d\n\nSimilar language against first-class airfare appears in the Democratic budget resolution for 2014, but Brownley voted against that budget plan, too. Thus she\u2019s one of the few lawmakers in either party who did not vote for either resolution \u2014 and thus cannot claim to have voted against first-class travel for lawmakers.\n\nBut wait, the story\u2019s not over yet. Brownley, along with several other lawmakers who did not vote for either budget resolution, is a co-sponsor of a bill with a mouthful of a title: If Our Military Has to Fly Coach Then so Should Congress Act of 2014. Unlike the nonbinding resolutions, this bill would actually have the force of law. But House Republicans have not allowed the bill to come up for a vote.\n\nEven so, none of this legislative effort would save much money. Each member of Congress gets a base allowance for travel, which is adjusted according to the distance from Washington to their congressional district. The allowance would not be cut; the proposed law will only require that lawmakers could not spend it on first-class fare. So passage of the law would merely be symbolic in terms of budget savings.\n\nThe ad claims that Brownley is \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with Washington.\u201d Actually, what\u2019s wrong with Washington is this kind of game playing, in which both parties gin up phony issues with little basis in reality.\n\nThe Congressional Leadership Fund goes especially off the deep end as it asserts that Brownley voted to allow first-class travel, when in fact she voted against a nonbinding budget resolution with nonbinding language on first-class travel. The Super PAC earns Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
