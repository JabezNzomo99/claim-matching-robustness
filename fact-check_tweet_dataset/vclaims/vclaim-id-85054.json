They have all fallen for a hilarious satire and published it as real news. Read on\u2026\n\nOn the occasion of Holi, Navbharat Times decided to do a full page of satire. It carried stories about Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallya partying in Delhi, 18% GST on Good Morning messages, Renuka Chowdhary laughing at Rahul Gandhi\u2019s top level meeting, China and Pakistan doing Yoga in Doklam, subsidy on liquor if you link Aadhaar, and so on. The stories were satirical in the spirit of \u201cbura na mano Holi hai\u201d. Out of a page full of satire, the three picked on one story. Yes, the one about Rahul Gandhi.\n\nZee News was the first to run the satire as real news. They tweeted, \u201cRenuka Chowdary now laughs in Rahul Gandhi\u2019s high level meeting, party upset\u201d Zee News went on to describe details about the incident at a Congress high- level meeting.\n\nZee News was left red-faced when they realized that it was a joke that they had taken seriously. The same was also pointed out to them by a NBT journalist. In their haste, Zee News deleted its article. It forgot however to delete its tweet that we have shared above.\n\nRight wing web portal OpIndia that regularly scouts the net for negative news on topics linked to Rahul Gandhi, opposition parties, Muslims, liberals, etc was the next to report the false news. In its characteristic style laced with whataboutery, OpIndia rewrote the Zee News article in English and went on to ask, \u201cwill Congress supporters defend her now\u201d.\n\nThe hilarious OpIndia article reported in all seriousness, \u201cRahul was speaking about the grim situation the party is in currently. He added that the party leaders would have to \u2018give their best\u2019 to overcome the hardships. Right then, Renuka Chowdhary laughed at full throttle, again. A Congress leader, on conditions of anonymity, has stated that Renuka\u2019s laughter was met with by stunned silence by other attendees. The Congress President, seeing that reaction, reportedly sat down abruptly without finishing his talk.\u201d ;\n\nIt took jibes at the Congress spokesperson, supporters and feminists and asked, \u201cWill Renuka Chowdhary have the same kind of support this time around too?\u201d Little did OpIndia realize that all their whataboutery was wasted on an incident that never took place. It was a satirical piece they were reporting in all seriousness as real news. OpIndia had quoted Zee News report and just like the recent case where they accused Mumbai police of inviting Ajaz Khan as a Chief Guest this time too they did not do any fact check.\n\nOpIndia\u2019s reaction on learning that the original piece was a satire was rather shocking. They didn\u2019t delete, retract or apologize. They quietly added a sentence at the end of the article saying \u201cNote : This is a Holi special satire\u201d, removed the Zee News tweet they had earlier quoted and made a few more changes to their article to make it look like a satire. Well, we can only feel sorry for their readers who outraged based on a fake news that was presented by the portal as factual. OpIndia perhaps thought that no one will notice the amendment to the article. They couldn\u2019t escape the sharp eye of Alt News who archived the earlier version.\n\nLike OpIndia, Postcard News wrote a whole story based on the fake Zee News report. They concluded \u201cOnce again it is proved that Rahul Gandhi is not taken seriously by even his own party leaders.\u201d Postcard News can perhaps be forgiven for this gaffe because they are serial peddlers of fake news and most people already know that their articles can\u2019t be taken seriously.\n\nPostcard News has not bothered to delete or amend the article. In their case, it doesn\u2019t matter as the article fits in well with rest of the content on their website.\n\nFalling for satire is not so funny. It raises serious issues about bias in the selection of news and editorial checks before publishing it. How the portal reacted on realizing they had published false news is something for them to reflect on. Readers would expect honesty, not a cover-up.", "lang": "en"}
