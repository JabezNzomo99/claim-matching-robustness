The incident was also covered in various outlets, such as the World Health Organization, CNN, ABC News, and Radio New Zealand. However, the claim that one of the babies was injected without parental consent does not appear to be supported by any evidence nor was this claim repeated in other outlets apart from the Daily Mail.\n\nAs the Immunisation Advisory Centre of New Zealand reports, the inquiry showed that the deaths were the result of human error during vaccine preparation. The MMR vaccine used in Samoa came in the form of a powder which needed to be diluted in water \u2013 the nurses who had prepared the vaccine wrongly diluted the powder with anesthetic instead. This error resulted in the babies\u2019 deaths.\n\nThe MMR vaccine itself has been shown to be safe and effective. Human errors in vaccination unfortunately do occur (as with many medical procedures such as surgery), but are very rare, and should not constitute a reason to avoid vaccinating a child if their health permits.\n\nAccording to Radio New Zealand, most of the vaccination program \u2013 except the MMR vaccine \u2013 was restarted in October 2018. The MMR vaccination program was only resumed in April 2019. Unfortunately, the lapse in MMR vaccination over several months contributed to a fall in vaccination coverage to \u201cas low as 31%\u201d (at least 95% coverage is needed to be protective). Not unexpectedly, a measles outbreak was declared in Samoa in October 2019.\n\nEven though the investigation found no issue with the MMR vaccine and explained the cause, the article has been shared hundreds of times on social media since then. Many posts misleadingly suggest the MMR vaccine itself is responsible for the death by omitting to mention the results of the investigation.\n\nWe have reached out to the authors of the Daily Mail, World Health Organization, CNN, ABC News, and Radio New Zealand articles to ask that they update their articles with a link to the results of the investigation so these articles cannot be used to mislead people on social media.", "lang": "en"}
