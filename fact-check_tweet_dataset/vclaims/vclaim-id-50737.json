No one sees our dead bodies but everyone sees the stones in our hands -translated)\u201d\n\nThe above message was shared by a Facebook user with an image of a woman who is profusely bleeding from her head. The message suggests that this image depicts a woman from Kashmir injured by the Indian army. A few more individuals on Facebook and Twitter have shared the image with a similar message.\n\nWe were also alerted by a user that the same image is circulating on WhatsApp.\n\nA Google search of the image revealed that the image is not from India. We found an article published by a Shia News website called JafariyaNews.com in February 2005, according to which these images depict the observation of Ashura, the tenth day of Muharram. The Shia Muslim sect mourns the sacrifice of Imam Hussein, the son of Hazrat Ali and the grandson of Prophet Muhammad on this day. They commonly practice chest-beating (Latyma), self-flagellation and cut their foreheads.\n\nIn the article, this picture was posted under the section titled, \u201cLebanon\u201d, which suggests that the picture could possibly be from Lebanon.\n\nIt is noteworthy that sharp objects, penetrating people\u2019s skulls, are visible in the image.\n\nIn conclusion, an image taken during the observation of Ashura, where a woman was bleeding from a self-inflicted wound, was shared as a picture portraying atrocities by the Indian army in Kashmir.", "lang": "en"}
