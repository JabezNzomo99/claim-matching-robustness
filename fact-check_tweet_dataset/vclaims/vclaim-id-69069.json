Its headline paints taxpayers as bearers of the burden for the school, which opened July 30.\n\n\"LeBron\u2019s \u2018I Promise School\u2019 To Cost Taxpayers Millions Of Dollars Every Year,\" it says.\n\nWannabe Entertainment is correct that taxpayers will pay millions of dollars for the school. However, the framing of the article could mislead readers to believe taxpayers will pay millions of dollars on top of what they were paying before, which is not the case.\n\nThe first few paragraphs of the story are lifted straight from an Aug. 5 Cleveland Plain Dealer story. After that, the Wannabe Entertainment story switches to a diatribe about Trump's tweeted critique of James and CNN's Don Lemon after an interview and the \"entire anti-Trump universe\" coming to the basketball star's defense. Its version does not go on, as the Plain Dealer did, to credit James's investment.\n\nThe I Promise School is a first-through-eighth grade public school that is part of the Akron Public School District.\n\nBecause it is a public school, the LeBron James Family Foundation will foot a portion of the cost, but not the entire bill.\n\n\"This is a public school,\" Akron Public Schools spokesman Mark Williamson told PolitiFact. \"Taxpayers support all of our schools including this one.\"\n\nPublic schools are funded by the state, property taxes and federal funds. So by law, the LeBron James Family Foundation cannot fully fund the school if it wanted to.\n\nThe foundation pays for the additional services at the school that the other schools in the district do not have, including GED classes and job placement for parents, guest speakers and a food pantry.\n\nStephanie Rosa, a spokeswoman for the LeBron James Family Foundation, told PolitiFact the foundation hasn\u2019t added up how much it contributed to the school.\n\nA $2 million rough estimate covered some building renovations, such as rewiring for technology and staff hires for the family center. But the amount of money spent up until the day the school opened has not been made public.\n\nBefore the opening of James\u2019s school, the I Promise program had been in Akron elementary schools for more than 10 years. There are 32 elementary schools and kids from all those schools were in the program but now in one location.\n\n\"It\u2019s not a new program, not new students, not even a new building,\" Williamson said.\n\nPoint being, taxpayers were going to pay for the students whether or not James got involved.\n\nThere are 46 schools in the Akron Public School District. Williamson said 35 of those schools have been rebuilt and during that time, the home of the current I Promise school served as the temporary school for those students who were displaced in that in-between time.\n\n\"For about 15 years, this building housed every student from every school that has been rebuilt,\" Williamson said.\n\nWilliamson said the 240 students enrolled at I Promise were already in the program but in their respective elementary schools.\n\n\"All we\u2019re doing is taking kids that we already support and putting them in a different location,\" he said.\n\nThe cost of educating the students is consistent. So are the teachers\u2019 salaries.\n\nThe opening of this school puts all the students in the I Promise program under one roof from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., July through May. There are no additional costs because the district didn\u2019t hire any new teachers or recruit new students.\n\nA story on Wannabeent.com says, \"Lebron\u2019s \u2018I Promise School\u2019 To Cost Taxpayers Millions Of Dollars Every Year.\"\n\nThe headline and subsequent story might leave people thinking James\u2019 school will be a drag on taxpayer resources. But taxpayers are paying the same amount of money they\u2019d pay whether or not James got involved. James\u2019s foundation is funding enhancements meant to try to elevate students attending the school.\n\nThe statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.", "lang": "en"}
