Trump has repeatedly touted the policy, crediting it with saving \"hundreds of thousands of lives\" during the Fox News town hall.\n\nKate Bedingfield, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager, declared Biden\u2019s support for the China restrictions months later in a statement to CNN on April 3, a Friday. CNN posted its story in the afternoon.\n\n\"Joe Biden supports travel bans that are guided by medical experts, advocated by public health officials, and backed by a full strategy,\" Bedingfeld told CNN. \"Science supported this ban, therefore he did too.\"\n\nBut Biden never explicitly called the travel restrictions xenophobic, as Trump has claimed.\n\nAt a campaign event on Jan. 31, the same day Trump announced the China travel restrictions, Biden cited Trump\u2019s \"xenophobia\" but did not specifically mention the administration\u2019s policy. He said that in a time of \"crisis with the coronavirus,\" the \"credibility of a president is most needed.\"\n\n\"This is no time for Donald Trump's record of hysteria xenophobia, hysterical xenophobia, and fear-mongering to lead the way instead of science,\" he said.\n\nThe following day, Biden tweeted, \"We need to lead the way with science \u2014 not Donald Trump\u2019s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering.\"\n\nBiden used the word twice more in March. But one comment was in reference to Trump calling the coronavirus a \"foreign\" virus, and the second was not clearly in reference to the travel policy.\n\nBates, Biden\u2019s spokesman, told us in March that Biden \"has decried Trump's xenophobia for years, and was saying that it shouldn't influence the U.S. approach to this outbreak.\"\n\n\"This was not in reference to coronavirus travel restrictions,\" he said.\n\nAn April ad from the Trump campaign selectively edited a clip of Biden to make it seem like the former vice president admitted to complimenting Trump for the China travel restrictions. But in its full context, the clip shows Biden was criticizing Trump for not acting with enough \"urgency.\"\n\nTrump said Biden called the ban on travel coming in from China \"xenophobic,\" and that \"he actually apologized with a letter on a Friday night saying \u2018he made the right move.\u2019\"\n\nWe found no record of any letter or apology from Biden. Trump appears to be citing a campaign official\u2019s statement to the media in support of Trump\u2019s decision.\n\nBiden has used the word \"xenophobic\" several times in reference to Trump, but not directly in reference to the China travel policy.", "lang": "en"}
