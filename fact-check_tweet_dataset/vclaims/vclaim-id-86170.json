And it\u2019s a massive problem in California. ... You go to other places where they have denser trees \u2014 it\u2019s more dense, where the trees are more flammable \u2014 they don\u2019t have forest fires like this, because they maintain. And it was very interesting, I was watching the firemen and they\u2019re raking brush \u2014 you know the tumbleweed and brush and all this stuff that\u2019s growing underneath. It\u2019s on fire and they\u2019re raking it working so hard, and they\u2019re raking all this stuff. If that was raked in the beginning, there\u2019d be nothing to catch on fire. It\u2019s very interesting to see. A lot of the trees, they took tremendous burn at the bottom, but they didn\u2019t catch on fire. The bottom is all burned but they didn\u2019t catch on fire because they sucked the water, they\u2019re wet. You need forest management, and they don\u2019t have it.\u201d\n\nTrump may have called the Saudi king to complain about oil prices. But the plunge from about $80 started in mid-October after reports of slowing demand, exacerbated by Trump\u2019s unexpected grant of sanctions waivers to some of Iran\u2019s biggest customers. The Saudi government has indicated it will join other OPEC producers in cutting production in order to boost prices, as the current level strains its budget. OPEC in July decided to increase production and the Saudis were slow to follow. But now the oil cartel plans to cut production in an effort to get the price of oil up again. (Note: Trump appeared to be mixing up the price for Brent crude, produced outside the United States, with West Texas Intermediate, produced in the United States. Brent has been trading about $10 a barrel higher than WTI, so the price drop has been $20, not $30.)", "lang": "en"}
