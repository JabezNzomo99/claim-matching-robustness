Another Facebook Page, Musalmano Jaago aur Jagaao had shared this video with a message, \u201cGujrat main gujraati log kasam kharahe hai KE woh log aaj se musalmaan ki dukaan see maal nahi kharidenge.\u201d It has been viewed more than 6,000 times.\n\nWho are this people?\n\nWe found a Facebook post condemning the boycott of Muslim shops which was posted byMuslim Ekta Manch Tasnim. In this post, they identify the members of the group as belonging to Vishwa Hindu Parishad. The post includes a formal letter written on the letter head of Muslim Ekta Manch, Gujarat. In the letter, Bhavnagar Superintendent of Police was requested to probe and take necessary actions.\n\nIn conversation with Alt News, Imtiyaz Pathan, convener of the Muslim Ekta Manch said, \u201cI had spoken to our friends in Bhavnagar. According to them, the man leading the group is Kirit Mistry, a VHP leader from Bhavnagar. Our members (Muslim Ekta Manch) have also identified a few more people in the group. I have submitted this letter to the Bhavnagar SP Pravin Mal, proposing it to be taken as a complaint and register an FIR on it.\u201d\n\nConfirming this, Mustufa K Kachaliya, chairman of the Congress Bhavnagar District Minority Department said, \u201cThe group includes people who are associated with Bharatiya Janata Party, Bajrang Dal, and Vishwa Hindu Parishad. The man leading the oath is a VHP member named Kirit Mistry.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, an article published by Sandesh Bhavnagar edition on November 2, 2018 reported, \u201d Bhavnagar SP Pravin said that after the murder of Mahuva VHP president, a rally under the leadership of VHP by Bhavnagar VHP leader Kirit Mistry was organized. An application letter was given to the Talaja Mamlatdar and then people present in the rally took an oath to not buy any item from a shop owned by a Muslim. Hence asking people to economically boycott the Muslim traders.\u201d\n\nAlt News also contacted the Bhavnagar SP Pravin Mal to inquire about this incident. He said, \u201cThey have submitted an application and on basis of which DySP Mahuva is probing the matter. Prima facie, these are not the government officials according to the application.\u201d Police are investigating the matter further. Werleman\u2019s initial claim about members of Indian Government participating in the boycott is untrue. However, his clarification that they were BJP members is closer to reality as the group of people consisted members of BJP, and VHP all of whom are part of the larger Sangh Parivar.", "lang": "en"}
