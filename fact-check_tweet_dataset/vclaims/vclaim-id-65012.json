The judge also authorized the removal of children from the ranch.\n\n \n\n Authorities said then that the crucial initial call came from a 16-year-old girl who told the shelter she\u2019d suffered sexual and physical abuse at the hands of her husband on the ranch.\n\n \n\n Texans watching the saga\u2014including the separation of many children from their mothers and siblings\u2014grew uncertain over whether state officials had overstepped their lawful duty to intervene in response to reports of child abuse or neglect.\n\n \n\n In May 2008, the Texas Supreme Court ordered all but a handful of the children to be returned to the ranch. The court further ruled that the state went too far by removing every child. It also said the state failed to show that any more than five teenage girls were being sexually abused or that prepubescent children were in danger.\n\n \n\n In the following months, however, officials filed criminal charges ranging from bigamy to sexual assault of a child against 12 men connected with the ranch, including sect leader Warren Jeffs, 54.\n\n \n\n Last November, Raymond Jessop, 38, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for sexually assaulting an underage girl with whom he had a \"spiritual marriage.\" His young wife had become pregnant at age 16.\n\n \n\n But the state has ended its day-to-day oversight of the ranch residents; the last girl returned from foster care in August 2009.\n\n \n\n And officials never found anyone who admitted to being the girl authorities say called the crisis center. They did determine, however, that the call was made from a phone in an apartment in Colorado Springs, Colo., then home to Rozita Swinton, a woman who has been convicted making another hoax call.\n\n \n\n Spokesman Patrick Crimmins of the Texas Department of Family Protective Services, which oversees Child Protective Services, the agency responsible for investigating suspicions of abuse and neglect, conceded that the call from Colorado prompted investigators to seek judicial approval to visit the ranch.\n\n \n\n But Crimmins disputed the notion that the call\u2014hoax or not\u2014prompted the removal of children.\n\n \n\n \"Once caseworkers arrived at the YFZ Ranch,\" Crimmins said, \"the investigation that occurred and the subsequent removal was based on what investigators found \u2014 evidence of abuse.\"\n\n \n\n A December 2008 DFPS report concluded that 12 girls who\u2019d been living on the ranch were victims of sexual abuse. The report said more than 260 children suffered neglect because they were exposed to sexual abuse in their households.\n\n \n\n Medina correctly said more than 400 children were taken from their parents. And the detention of the children happened after state authorities were called by the shelter that fielded a call from Colorado that may have been a hoax \u2014 though no authority has proved the call was a prank.\n\n \n\n Significantly, the removal of children didn\u2019t solely occur because of the call, as Crimmins said.\n\n \n\n The children were taken temporarily based on what investigators saw upon the raid. Therefore, Medina's additional claim that the children were removed \"without warrant\" isn't supported.\n\n \n\n We rate Medina's claim Half True.", "lang": "en"}
