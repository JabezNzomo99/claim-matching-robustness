{"title": "Did Jacob Blake's Ex-Girlfriend's Aunt Denounce Him on Twitter?", "subtitle": "The Twitter account @lifeisasoph briefly trended in August 2020, before it was suspended.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2020-09-04T10:36:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-82463", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/lifeisasoph-jacob-blake-ex/", "vclaim": "In September 2020, multiple readers asked Snopes to examine a series of tweets posted by a Twitter user with the handle @lifeisasoph, who claimed to be related to the ex-girlfriend of Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man shot several times by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, some days earlier. Twitter suspended the account on Aug. 31.\n\nUsers posted screenshots of the tweets on The Donald, a website popular among some supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump, especially since Reddit banned the subreddit The_Donald in June 2020 after its users repeatedly engaged in hate speech and harassment.\n\nOn Sep. 2, the right-leaning talk radio host Richard Randall posted on Facebook this message: \u201cNeither BLM, nor Twitter, care about the life of \u2018Sabrina\u2019 the black woman who was sexually assaulted by Jacob Blake right before police arrived to try to arrest him. Sabrina\u2019s aunt was standing up for her on Twitter, but got banned.\u201d\n\nThat caption accompanied screenshots of several tweets by @lifeisasoph, which had earlier been posted to Twitter by @Patrici15767099:\n\nOn Aug. 31, the right-wing website Trending Politics published an article that unquestioningly presented @lifeisasoph\u2019s tweets, and identity, at face value, writing \u201cAfter the rape victim\u2019s aunt took to Twitter to call out the hypocrisy, the social media platform quickly shut down her account.\u201d\n\nAfter Twitter suspended @lifeisasoph on Aug. 31, several principally right-leaning observers integrated that suspension into their promotion of the account\u2019s claims, sharing @lifeisasoph\u2019s tweets at face value while also claiming Twitter had banned the account precisely because its claims were authentic and accurate. For example, right-wing commentator Evan Kilgore posted several screenshots of @lifeisasoph\u2019s tweets, along with the caption:\n\n\u201cINSANE: Twitter suspended the account of Jacob Blake\u2019s ex-girlfriend\u2019s aunt, @lifeisasoph, after she began publicly speaking out against him.\u201d\n\nIn keeping with a broader pattern of disinformation, which we have examined in depth previously, @lifeisasoph\u2019s condemnation of Blake and the racial justice protests that followed his shooting, were given credibility by the claim of a family relationship with Blake\u2019s ex-girlfriend, who has accused him of sexual assault and domestic abuse. However, that claim of a family link was bogus.\n\nA \u2018Grown Man From St. Louis,\u2019 or a Woman From West Africa?\n\nBefore Twitter suspended @lifeisasoph, Snopes gathered ample evidence of past tweets from the account which reveal a pattern of inauthentic behavior, principally used to advance right-wing talking points in online debates. Adopting the persona of the aunt of an alleged sexual assault victim was the latest, and perhaps the most distasteful, example of that tendency.\n\nThroughout 2020, @lifeisasoph was presented as a Black woman, repeatedly using that claimed identity as a rhetorical weapon. In July, for example, when Kelly Loeffler, co-owner of the Atlanta Dream WNBA franchise, expressed opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement, @lifeisasoph used their claimed identity as a Black woman to support Loeffler\u2019s position, writing:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a black woman who opposes the BLM organization. You can do that as a white person too and it not be racist. The leaders of this group are Marxist sellouts.\u201d\n\nDuring the same month, Libertarian presidential candidate Jo Jorgensen tweeted that \u201cIt is not enough to be passively not racist, we must be actively anti-racist.\u201d @lifeisasoph replied: \u201cHi. Black woman here. This doesn\u2019t make any sense. Just be a good person. Fuck.\u201d\n\nIn June 2020, during a back-and-forth about the Ku Klux Klan, racism, and President Trump, one of @lifeisasoph\u2019s interlocutors characterized Trump\u2019s past pronouncements as racist, to which @lifeisasoph replied: \u201cPlease tell this 55 year old black woman, working in Washington DC, fighting to overturn policies Joe Biden wrote, sponsored and endorsed, why I need to vote for the white person [approved] candidate\u2026\u201d\n\nHowever, before they presented as a Black, conservative woman fiercely defying white liberal stereotypes of Black views on race and politics, @lifeisasoph presented himself a man. \u201cI\u2019m a grown man who doesn\u2019t cry of the actions of another grown man,\u201d he wrote in September 2019, during an argument about the St. Louis Rams NFL franchise (now the Los Angeles Rams):\n\nIn April 2019, he wrote: \u201cPersonally I LOVE feminism. Harder work for women and easier sex for men? Sign me up,\u201d and in December 2018 he proudly declared to the world \u201cMy balls are hot.\u201d\n\nThe man behind the account posted several other claims which, although not inherently mutually incompatible, did speak to a broader penchant for issuing self-descriptions that seemed intended to give his arguments greater force or enhanced credibility, rather than being authentic components of an actual biography.\n\nFor example, in March 2019, U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, tweeted about the dangers posed by climate change, writing \u201cThe Midwest is drowning as we speak.\u201d @lifeisasoph replied \u201cI live in the Midwest and I have no idea what she\u2019s talking about.\u201d Just a few months later, he advocated for gun rights, tweeting \u201cI live in a border town. I\u2019ll keep my guns thank you.\u201d Later, @lifeisasoph would repeatedly describe himself as a Black woman living and working in Washington D.C.\n\nWhen the Kansas City Chiefs NFL franchise introduced new rules that discouraged or prohibited fans from displaying Native American symbols in the team\u2019s stadium, @lifeisasoph claimed to be of Quapaw ancestry, and said \u201cit\u2019s disappointing that our heritage is being removed.\u201d During an argument about the transatlantic slave trade, he claimed to be a woman from the West African nation of Benin.\n\nWhen defending Trump\u2019s alleged description of Haiti and other countries as \u201cshithole\u201d countries, @lifeisasoph wrote \u201cHaiti is a shithole country. Ask my father.\u201d\n\nPerhaps most revealing of all, though, were the inconsistencies and glaring inaccuracies in @lifeisasoph\u2019s tweets about the shooting of Blake, and the charges Blake faced of allegedly having subjected his ex-girlfriend, with whom he has three children in common, to sexual assault and domestic abuse. More detailed information about those charges can be found in our Aug. 27 fact check.\n\nInitially, on Aug. 25, two days after Blake was shot by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, @lifeisasoph wrote about the shooting in the manner of someone without any personal knowledge of the parties involved. He tweeted: \u201cAllegedly, he broke into his ex\u2019s house who was of age then beat her and raped her,\u201d and \u201cBlake had a warrant out for raping someone,\u201d and \u201cThis narrative that he was just breaking up a fight is plausible I guess but there\u2019s obviously more to the story\u2026\u201d\n\nIn the days that followed, his line of argument changed dramatically, and he began to describe Blake\u2019s ex-girlfriend as his \u201cniece,\u201d repeatedly tweeting claims that Blake had raped her, describing the woman\u2019s suffering, and writing \u201cshe\u2019s sitting there watching NBA demand justice for her rapist while we\u2019re still trying to get justice for her.\u201d\n\nOn at least three occasions, @lifeisasoph referred to his \u201cniece,\u201d Blake\u2019s ex-girlfriend, as \u201cRi.\u201d He even tweeted out the hashtag #JusticeForRi, which users on The Donald picked up on, with one poster writing, \u201cShe wants us to use #JusticeForRi.\u201d\n\nIn the ensuing days, that hashtag spread, with more than 1,000 posts across Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, most of them containing @lifeisasoph\u2019s Twitter handle, or screenshots of his tweets, and many of them explicitly pointing to the supposed authority and credibility of that account\u2019s claims and condemnations of the NBA strike, because @lifeisasoph claimed to be the aunt of \u201cRi\u201d \u2014 Blake\u2019s ex-girlfriend.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not that woman\u2019s name, and not even an appropriate abbreviation for it. The man behind @lifeisasoph, who fraudulently claimed to be a 55 year-old Black woman and the aunt of an alleged sexual assault victim in order to add credibility to his views on racial justice, appears to have also fabricated that nickname out of thin air.\n\nUsing various methods and several publicly available sources, Snopes has discovered the actual identity of Blake\u2019s ex-girlfriend. We are not naming her, because she alleges to be a victim of sexual assault and domestic abuse, and has so far not chosen to speak publicly. However, we can say with certainty that her name is not \u201cSabrina,\u201d as the talk radio host Richard Randall claimed on Facebook, and it is not at all conducive to the nickname \u201cRi.\u201d\n\nShe is a real person, though, and her experiences and version of events deserve careful and sympathetic attention. As such, her allegations against Blake are being acted upon by prosecutors in Kenosha County, Wisconsin. But the exploits of a \u201cgrown man from St. Louis\u201d who posed as a West African woman and the aunt of an alleged sexual assault victim had nothing to do with honoring that woman, and everything to do with boosting and amplifying the political views of @lifeisasoph, whoever he is.", "lang": "en"}
