{"title": "FALSE: Alaska, Hawaii, Washington State Overwhelmingly 'White, Rural'", "subtitle": "Voters took umbrage with coverage of Alaska, Hawaii, Washington Democratic caucuses characterizing voters as ethnically homogenous.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2016-03-28T00:00:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-11059", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/alaska-hawaii-washington-voters/", "vclaim": "In March 2016, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders swept the Democratic caucuses of Alaska, Hawaii, and Washington state in Presidential primaries. Not long after that, pundits wrote several articles claiming that Sanders did well because all some or all of the three states are not particularly ethnically diverse (Sanders has not been doing well with black voters compared to Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, and his supporters have been portrayed as overwhelmingly white).\n\nSanders\u2019s strategists have argued that their unique fundraising capabilities could help them pull off an upset \u2014 arguing that the process for Clinton was \u201cfrontloaded\u201d and that they have grassroots fundraising resources that past campaigns have lacked. Washington and Alaska had always looked to be favorable territory for Sanders, because they are predominantly white and rural \u2014 states with the kind of demographic makeup that has favored Sanders.\n\nWashington Post appeared to continue the narrative that Sanders does better in states with less diversity with a 27 March 2016 piece originally titled \u201cWhy Did Bernie Sanders Dominate Saturday? Caucuses in Whiter States\u201d \u2014 thereby implying that outside their relatively small black populations, Alaska and Hawaii are overwhelmingly \u201cwhite\u201d:\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted before, there\u2019s also a clear link between the number of black voters in a contest and the result. Hawaii is 3 percent black. Alaska is four percent black; Washington, about the same. When the composition of the black Democratic electorate has been below seven percent for states where Democratic primary exit polling in 2008 or 2016 was available, Clinton has lost by an average of 30 points this year. Over that percentage? She\u2019s won by 26.\n\nThe latter part of the article\u2019s title was later amended to read \u201cCaucuses in States with Smaller Black Populations,\u201d and the following note was appended to the article:\n\nAlaska and Hawaii in particular are among the top most ethnically and linguistically diverse states in the U.S., which media coverage seemed to overlook despite several previous stories on the subject (sometimes in the very same publications) about the \u201csurprising diversity\u201d of both states. As I wrote in 2014:\n\nSimilar drivers contribute to Hawaii\u2019s growing diversity, particularly marriage and families:\n\nSarah C.W. Yuan, a demographer at the University of Hawaii\u2019s Center on the Family, said the racial trends reflect growth and acceptance of multiracial marriages and an increased willingness of people to claim more than one racial identity. She said the decline in people identifying with one race only, from 78.6% in 2000 to 76.4% in the 2010 Census, was expected. \u201cHawaii\u2019s population has been more diverse over the years,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are many multiracial marriages, so we do see two-or-more-race groups increase over the years.\u201d\n\nThe perceived whitewashing was not lost on Twitter. Before long, #BernieMadeMeWhite was trending:\n\nIt\u2019s true that Washington state, Alaska, and Hawaii each have low populations of black voters relative to the national average (13.2 percent as of 2014), which political reporters say will affect the outcome of the elections. It\u2019s also true that the Sanders campaign has struggled with attracting black and Latino voters. However, it\u2019s definitively untrue that any of the three states are rural and ethnically homogenous, as some outlets outright stated. Even Washington state, the least diverse of the three, boasts ethnic diversity, including a significant Asian population.", "lang": "en"}
