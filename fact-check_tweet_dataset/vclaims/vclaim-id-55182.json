If the [governor or mayor] decides to open an essential or production area,\u201d he said, \u201cthere has to be a screening structure and medical monitoring of initial symptoms.\"\n\nThat strategy is accepted by most medical experts. But then Pazuello added:\n\n\u201cIf the case is asymptomatic, [the employee] is working, but also doesn\u2019t transmit [the virus]. If the case is symptomatic, he has to appear [at a testing center].\"\n\nThe claim that asymptomatic people do not spread the virus is false.\n\nTo be sure, the notion of asymptomatic spread has been the subject of debate and intensive research. The issue rose in prominence on June 8, when a World Health Organization official suggested that such silent transmission was \u201cvery rare\u201d and that asymptomatic patients were not driving virus spread.\n\nThe WHO walked it back the next day: \u201cI used the phrase \u2018very rare,\u2019 and I think that that\u2019s [a] misunderstanding to state that asymptomatic transmission globally is very rare. What I was referring to was a subset of studies,\u201d said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO\u2019s technical lead on the coronavirus pandemic, during a question-and-answer session.\n\nShe added that while the WHO couldn\u2019t say how much virus is spread by asymptomatic carriers, it certainly happens.\n\nThat same day, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, citing the WHO, asserted that the \u201cthe transmission through asymptomatic [people] is practically zero.\u201d He suggested it could \u201csignal to a faster opening of commerce and the extinction of those restrictive measures\u201d that had closed stores and prohibited public gatherings. He did add, however, that \u201cnothing is proven in the coronavirus issue.\u201d\n\nAsked about the issue on June 11, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told ABC\u2019s Good Morning America: \"We know from epidemiological studies they can transmit to someone who is uninfected even when they're without symptoms.\u201d\n\nAs the pandemic enters its fifth official month, numerous studies have found that symptomless transmission is spreading the virus.\n\nThe Washington Post reported on July 18 that studies trying to pinpoint the \u201cpatients zero\u201d in outbreaks show commonalities among the likely sources \u2013 one being people who are infected but asymptomatic.\n\nA recent study from China, which sampled the body surfaces of 13 COVID-19 patients (including two asymptomatic ones), revealed that asymptomatic people can contaminate their surroundings.\n\nAnother study by scientists at Italy\u2019s University of Padova and Imperial College London, released on June 30, found that more than 40 percent of positive cases in V\u00f2, a northern Italian town, showed no symptoms.\n\nConfusing the matter is the distinction drawn between \u201casymptomatic\u201d and \u201cpresymptomatic\u201d cases.\n\nAsymptomatic cases are those in which individuals test positive for coronavirus but never develop symptoms. But some of those who test positive while not showing symptoms develop them later. These cases are classified as presymptomatic.\n\nResearchers have shown that individuals can spread the virus before developing symptoms \u2013 and may actually be most contagious during that time. It is possible that patients who are asymptomatic turn out to be presymptomatic and highly infectious.\n\nThe risk from such silent spread explains the importance of widespread testing \u2013 so that these a- or pre- symptomatic cases can be discovered early and quarantined.\n\nA study by Chinese researchers, published in mid-April by the journal Nature Medicine, found that viral spreading began 2 to 3 days before the appearance of symptoms. By July, U.S. and Canadian researchers suggested that more than half of infections could be attributed to asymptomatic and presymptomatic \u201csilent transmission.\u201d\n\nAlso in July, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention weighed in with an assessment based on multiple studies.\n\n\u201c[I]n the aggregate, these diverse studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by persons with presymptomatic or asymptomatic infection, which may meaningfully contribute to the propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d the CDC concluded.\n\nBrazil has had more than 2.4 million COVID-19 cases and 87,000 deaths, second only to the United States, according to tracking by Johns Hopkins University & Medicine.\n\nRecently, Brazil\u2019s interim health minister has been promising transparency. Pazuello\u2019s July 23 statements followed a record of mixed signals from Bolsonaro\u2019s government, which critics say ignored health warnings while pushing to reopen the economy quickly.\n\nBrazil\u2019s Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper reported on July 22 that Pazuello had been alerted in May by a Health Ministry technical committee that, without isolation measures, it could take up to two years to control the pandemic. The minister nonetheless continued to push for reopening.\n\nIn June, Pazuello\u2019s administration temporarily stopped publishing overall data on Covid-19 cases and deaths. Pazuello later said the change was only a proposal.\n\nBolsonaro himself has consistently minimized the dangers of COVID-19, initially describing it as a \u201csmall cold\u201d and calling the alarm over the pandemic \u201chysterical.\u201d\n\nThen, on July 7, Bolsonaro said he tested positive for coronavirus and was taking the hydroxychloroquine \u2013 the controversial anti-malaria drug that hasn\u2019t been proved effective on the virus. Two weeks later, Bolsonaro tested positive for the virus a third time.\n\nOn July 25, however, Bolsonaro said he\u2019d tested negative and released a photo of himself with a box of hydroxychloroquine.\n\nPazuello, an army general who specializes in logistics, has no experience in health care. Since the outbreak, two Bolsonaro health ministers left their posts amid disagreements with him about isolation measures and the use of hydroxychloroquine.", "lang": "en"}
