No, that's not true: Brown is no longer behind bars. She was released on August 7, 2019, after being granted clemency.\n\nThe claim reappeared as a Facebook meme (archived here) on July 7, 2020. It read:\n\nThis is what the post looked at the time of writing:\n\nBut Brown is, in fact, already out of prison. Former Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam granted her executive clemency and commuted her sentence on January 7, 2019. She was released on August 7, 2019.\n\nBrown's case attracted widespread attention because of her age and the circumstances surrounding the crime. Her supporters long argued that Brown was forced into prostitution and acted in self-defense when she killed a man who paid to have sex with her. She was tried as an adult and given a life sentence.\n\nHer cause was supported and amplified by various celebrities, including Kim Kardashian West, who spoke about the case on Twitter in 2017. Back then, while Brown was still incarcerated, Kardashian West commented on a meme that's almost identical to the one mentioned above. She wrote:\n\nAccording to the Tennessean, Brown would not have been eligible for parole until she was 67, if Haslam had not intervened in the case.", "lang": "en"}
