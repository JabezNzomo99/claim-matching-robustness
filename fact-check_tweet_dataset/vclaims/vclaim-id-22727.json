The bust is that of former Bharatiya Jana Sangh leader and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) member Deen Dayal Upadhyaya.\n\nThe caption with the post reads, \"Pragya calls Godse a patriot, divider-in-chief (a reference to Time magazine's cover) pays tribute to Godse, because terrorists are now called patriots in our country.\"\n\nIt was Godse who had fired the fatal shot at Mahatma Gandhi on January 30, 1948.\n\nThis, and other similar posts are going viral after Bharatiya Janata Party's candidate from Bhopal - Pragya Thakur's recent statement in which she hailed Nathuram Godse as a patriot.\n\nThe archived versions of the posts can be viewed here, here and here.\n\nFollowing an uproar Pragya Thakur backtracked on her comment saying the party's line was her line but stopped short of an apology.\n\nShe apologised to the public on May 17, 2019 for her comments on Godse, through a tweet.\n\nIn his harshest critique yet, the prime minister told a news channel in an interview that he would never forgive Pragya Thakur for insulting Gandhi. (Read about it here)\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search on the Facebook post wherein Modi can be seen standing with folded hands in front of, what seems to be like, \n\na bust of Nathuram Godse.\n\nWe found a similar image shared along with some news reports published in 2017.\n\nAccording to an India Today article, the occasion was the 37th BJP foundation day and the prime minister, along with a coterie of senior ministers, was visiting the BJP headquarters in New Delhi.\n\nHere, the PM and other leaders paid tribute to party ideologue Deen Dayal Upadhyaya. This is the same image that has been shared with a false caption claiming the bust is that of Nathuram Godse.\n\nIn the videos above it is clearly mentioned that the PM and other BJP leaders had garlanded the bust of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya.\n\nThis is a portrait of VD Savarkar, not Godse\n\nIn another post Modi can be seen paying floral tributes to a portrait claimed to be, again, that of Godse. But the claim is false as it is a portrait of \n\nVinayak Damodar Savarkar.", "lang": "en"}
