But the claim is false; there is no evidence to support the allegation and Ghana\u2019s information minister has dismissed it.\n\nThe story was published on a Nigerian website called NaijaLiveTv on March 16, 2020. It has been viewed more than 16,000 times, according to a counter on the website.\n\nThe post, headlined \u201cJUST IN: Ghana President Akufo-Addo tests positive to Coronavirus [VIDEO]\u201d, says popular Ghanaian social media influencer Kevin Taylor made the claim based on \u201ca very credible source\u201d at Jubilee House -- the seat of the Ghanaian presidency.\n\nIt features an embedded tweet with footage of Taylor making the claims on his social media show, Loud Silence Radio. He alleges that Nana Akufo-Addo along with senior minister Yaw Osafo-Marfo tested positive for COVID-19 after attending the 69th birthday party of the west African country\u2019s First Lady, Rebecca Akufo-Addo.\n\nSocial media monitoring tool CrowdTangle reveals the claim also appears in posts shared here, here and here on Facebook, and here and here on Twitter.\n\nAFP traced the full version of the online show to a Facebook page called \u201cLoud Silence Radio & TV\u201d.\n\nIn this longer version, the Loud Silence Radio founder challenges the president and his minister to appear in public to prove he\u2019s tested negative for the deadly coronavirus \u201cbecause Ghanaians are worried and the nation is panicking\u201d.\n\nAFP found that the president held a meeting with the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Coronavirus response; met with the Pharmaceutical & Banking Industries; addressed the leadership of Ghana\u2019s Parliament; and went to a Breakfast Prayer.\n\nGhana\u2019s Information Minister Kojo Oppong Nkrumah refuted the claim in a video tweeted by the ministry. \u201cIt is not true,\u201d Nkrumah says in the footage, shot at a press conference called to address the false claim.\n\n\u201cWe will like to encourage that if you have access to a platform, use it to encourage compliance with preventive etiquette so that we can save as many lives as possible,\u201d he says further.\n\nMore than 240,000 cases of COVID-19 have so far been recorded globally with more than half occurring outside China where the first cases were recorded in December 2019, as AFP reported here. More than 10,000 people worldwide have died.\n\nGhana has a total of 11 coronavirus cases, as of March 19, 2020, an increase from its first two cases confirmed on March 12, 2020. The west African country has banned public gatherings and prohibited people who visited any country with more than 200 coronavirus cases 14 days earlier -- excluding official residents or Ghanaian citizens -- from entering the country, to curtail the spread of the pandemic.
