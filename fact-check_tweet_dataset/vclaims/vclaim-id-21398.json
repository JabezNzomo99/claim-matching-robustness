It did not come from Clinton\u2019s verified Twitter account. It appears to have been created and shared as millions braced for the powerful storm. Dorian pummeled the Bahamas, hovering over the northern part of the Caribbean country for more than three days before moving off and threatening states in the U.S. southeast region.\n\nThe fake tweet plays on long-standing, wide-ranging conspiracy theories about the Clinton Foundation and the Clintons. The foundation\u2019s recovery-assistance efforts in Haiti after a devastating 2010 earthquake have also been the source of a number of unfounded claims.\n\nClinton, who served as secretary of state during the Obama administration and was President Donald Trump\u2019s Democratic rival in 2016, did not write the above tweet. The only thing Clinton tweeted about Dorian were safety tips for Florida residents as the storm approached.", "lang": "en"}
