At one point a woman, unable to contain her tears, walks to the temple area of the house and prostrates in front of the deity.\n\nMeanwhile, the video ends with pictures of athlete Hima Das displayed on the screen.\n\nYou can watch the video below and access its archived version here.\n\nThis video has taken social media by storm ever since the 19-year old sprinter from Assam, Hima Das, won five gold medals in various athletic meets across Poland and Czech Republic earlier this month.\n\nBOOM looked for the video on YouTube with keywords 'Hima Das family' and found that the same video had been published on September 3, 2018.\n\nTaking cue from a reply to the video which mentioned that people shown therein were family members of Swapna Barman and not Hima Das, we searched with the keywords 'Swapna Barman's family'.\n\nBOOM found the same video uploaded by Hindustan Times on August 30, 2018.\n\nOn August 29, 2018 she had become the first Indian heptathlete to win a gold medal at the Asian Games held in Jakarta. The HT video was uploaded a day later, on August 30.\n\nRead more about Swapna Barman's Asian Games gold win here.\n\nAlso, if one listens to the video intently one can clearly hear the commentator say 'Barman takes the gold' at the 30th second in the video, which makes it clear that it was Barman who participated in this particular event and not Hima Das.", "lang": "en"}
