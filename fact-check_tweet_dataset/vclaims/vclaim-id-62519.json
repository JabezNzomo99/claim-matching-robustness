He routinely cries \u201cvoter fraud\u201d where none exists. He entertains so many election-flavored conspiracy theories, even the presidential race he won in 2016 has come under fire. And yet, he votes by mail. None of it makes much sense.\n\nMichigan and Nevada are battlegrounds in the November elections, but they\u2019re not the only states planning to use absentee or mail-in ballots to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. For some reason, Trump did not tweet similar threats to Georgia, Iowa, Nebraska or West Virginia, several states doing the same thing as Michigan (but where his reelection prospects are better).\n\nStates and local governments are in charge of running U.S. elections. Each jurisdiction has its own set of rules, but all states offer accommodations for voters who cannot make it to the polls. \u201cIn two-thirds of the states, any qualified voter may vote absentee without offering an excuse, and in one-third of the states, an excuse is required,\u201d according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nIn response to the coronavirus, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson (D) announced this week that all 7.7 million registered voters in the state would receive applications for absentee ballots \u2014 not the ballots themselves, as Trump claimed \u2014 for elections in August and November. (More than six hours after his tweet, Trump deleted it and replaced it with one that said \u201cabsentee ballot applications.\u201d)\n\nDocumented instances of voter fraud are exceedingly rare in the United States. The same is true with absentee voting, according to Richard L. Hasen, an elections expert at the University of California at Irvine. \u201cThere were 491 prosecutions related to absentee ballots in all elections nationwide between 2000 and 2012, out of literally billions of ballots cast,\u201d Hasen wrote in an essay for The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t really have an issue with absentee ballot request forms being sent out to voters as much as ballots being sent directly to voters,\u201d Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel told reporters Monday. \u201cWe are really against, when people talk about mail-in voting, the ballots being sent directly to people who may or may not want them or sent to all the registered voters even when their voter rolls have not been cleaned up.\u201d\n\nMichigan added a state constitutional right to vote by mail in a 2018 ballot referendum. Setting aside the fact that government officials routinely carry out their duties by taking actions not specifically authorized in statutes (it\u2019s impossible to write laws for every conceivable scenario), the state of Michigan\u2019s election statute gives the secretary of state the power to \u201cadvise and direct local election officials as to the proper methods of conducting elections\u201d and to \u201cprescribe and require uniform forms, notices, and supplies the secretary of state considers advisable for use in the conduct of elections and registrations,\u201d among others.\n\nIn an unpublished opinion (meaning, it set no legal precedent), an intermediate appeals court in Michigan held in 2008 that a county clerk could not mail unsolicited ballot applications to voters above the age of 60. That opinion also says \u201cthe county clerk and the county board of election commissioners must follow the directions provided by the Secretary of State in her role as Michigan\u2019s chief election officer.\u201d Benson is the secretary of state, not a county clerk.", "lang": "en"}
