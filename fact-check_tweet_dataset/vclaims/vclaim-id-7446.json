And did this happen recently? No, that's not true: Macedonian fake news websites are reposting news from 2014 about a woman who set fire to her husband for molesting his stepdaughter and claim without any evidence the man is muslim. It is just a cheap ploy to get clicks by abusing people's emotions.\n\nA recent example of the story comes from an article published by the website cvikasdrv.com on August 19, 2018 titled \"BREAKING: Woman Sets Pedophile Muslim Man on Fire After Catching Him Rape 7-Yr-Old Daughter - cvikasdrv.com\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nA woman has been arrested for dousing her husband with gasoline and setting him on fire after she caught him raping her 7-year-old daughter. 40-year-old Tatanysha Hedman of Renton, Washington, said she wanted to burn her pedophile husband alive because \"shooting him was too nice\" .According to Renton Police, Vincent Phillips, 52, was soaked in highly flammable fuel after he fell asleep in bed next to his wife. Investigators confirmed that he was then set on fire whilst he was sleeping.Philips then fled the apartment and managed to drive his car down the street whilst still ablaze to a Skyway convenience store screaming I'm on fire!\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail, leading them to think it was recent news because of the \"Breaking\" and the publication date:\n\nHere are two articles from 2014 and 2015 about what actually happened. You can see most of the hoax article has been copy pasted but the part about the man being a muslim was added to the headline and different, unrelated pictures were selected.\n\nAt least one of the pictures of burning men illustrating the story is from 2005 and shows a Romanian man protesting:\n\nThe exact same story also appeared on notorious fake news website Now8News in 2017 with the misleading photographs and without mentioning the religion of the man:\n\nAt the time Snopes checked the story too and found that most of the details were accurate except for the photos:\n\nHowever the addition of the word \"Muslim\" in the headline clearly makes this fake news, as is pretending the story just happened recently.", "lang": "en"}
