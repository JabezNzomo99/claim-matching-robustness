No - old video, false claim", "subtitle": "", "author": "www.altnews.in", "date": "2019-05-02T16:00:02+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-17522", "url": "https://www.altnews.in/muslims-thrashed-brahman-in-west-bengal-no-old-video-false-claim/", "vclaim": "A video of a crowd of people thrashing a man dressed in white is being circulated on social media with the claim that a Brahmin was attacked by Muslims in West Bengal.\n\n\u201cMuslims beating one Brahman in WB in front of his daughter. During Pooja in his house, the bell sound should not be heard by anybody. This is common in West Bengal in Muslim dominated areas. No media is covering the atrocities on Hindus. Whereas human rights wings are crying for shelter of Rohangya [Rohingya] Muslims in India,\u201d is the caption used to share the video.\n\nOn Twitter, the same incident recorded from a different angle and a different spot is in circulation.\n\nThe identical video has been doing social media for the last two years.\n\nIt was also shared in 2018.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nThe claim that a Brahmin was beaten by Muslims to stop him from praying is false. The same message was debunked by the Kolkata police in a series of tweets when it was viral in 2017. According to the police\u2019s statement, the man was a Hindu priest who allegedly molested a woman and was manhandled by her family as a consequence.\n\nA video posted on Youtube two years ago shows moments before the priest was thrashed. Here, he can be seen attempting to allegedly rape the woman.\n\nThe viral video was debunked by The Quint and Boomlivein 2017.\n\nA purported attempt of molestation was revived on social media with the false claim that members of the Muslim community attacked a Brahmin in West Bengal, thus, giving the incident a communal angle. If one carefully listens to the men conversing in the video, one of them can be heard saying that the priest had misbehaved with his \u2018bou ma\u2019, which could either mean wife or daughter-in-law.\n\nThe last month has witnessed a deluge of misinformation circulated with regard to West Bengal. A 2017 video from Gujarat was also given a communal colour and circulated with the false claim that Rohingyas and Bangladeshis were mistreating BJP workers in Bengal.", "lang": "en"}
