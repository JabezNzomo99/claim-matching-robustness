The claims are misleading; schools are expected to reopen in September, only individuals directly affected by COVID-19 are eligible for financial aid, mortgage relief is granted by banks on a case-by-case basis, and rent is still due.\n\n\u201cCanada closed schools for the rest of the year. Froze mortgages and rent. Giving all $980 every 2 weeks. The people only have to pay utilities,\u201d according to a Facebook post shared in the United States on July 8, 2020.\n\nThe post is nearly identical to others that circulated when pandemic-related shutdowns began in North America, in March 2020. AFP debunked the posts at the time, and they remain misleading.\n\nThe claims are being repeated as Congress struggles to agree on a new relief package for Americans suffering from the pandemic\u2019s economic fallout.\n\nPublic schools are currently closed across Canada for the summer holidays after many of them shut for several months due to the novel coronavirus, which had infected almost 117,000 Canadians and killed nearly 9,000 by July 29, according to Johns Hopkins University. Most provinces intend to resume in-classroom learning at the beginning of the new school year and have several backup plans in case of a second wave of COVID-19.\n\nIn the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Quebec, schools will open in September, according to statements to AFP from each province\u2019s ministry of education. Students in Ontario and Nova Scotia will also return to school in September, according to press releases from their respective governments.\n\nManitoba plans on reopening schools in September, but the province\u2019s ministry of education will have to confirm this plan on August 1, 2020.\n\nIn the Pacific coast province of British Columbia (BC), students were given the option to return to classrooms in June, which 200,000 pupils did, according to BC\u2019s education ministry. On July 29, provincial authorities announced that K-12 students will go back to classrooms full-time for the beginning of the school year, on September 8.\n\nNew Brunswick\u2019s plan for the return to classes includes a social distancing requirement for students in grades nine through 12, to be applied \u201cto the greatest extent possible.\u201d\n\nThe claim that each family is eligible for almost $1,000 a month \u201cis false,\u201d Anna Arneson, a spokeswoman for Canada\u2019s Ministry of Finance, told AFP by email.\n\nOn March 25, Canada\u2019s legislature adopted a Can$82 billion emergency package to assist Canadian individuals, families and companies.\n\nThe act introduces the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), which grants a $2,000 taxable monthly allowance \u201cfor up to four months for workers who lose their income as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d The CERB was extended to 24 weeks total in June 2020.\n\nThe CERB does not cover \u201ceach family\u201d in the country, as posts claim, and those already receiving unemployment and sickness benefits are not covered.\n\nHowever, workers furloughed without income may apply, as well as those who are sick, quarantined, or taking care of someone who is ill with COVID-19.\n\nOn March, 22, the Canadian Bankers Association (CBA) announced that the country\u2019s six largest financial institutions would offer mortgage payment relief.\n\nBanks including RBC, CIBC, TD, BMO, Scotiabank, and National Bank announced that for individuals struggling financially due to COVID-19, deferrals on payments for up to six months would be available.\n\nInterest on outstanding mortgage balances continued to accrue. Details on who qualifies were not made public, and decisions are made on a case-by-case basis with clients.\n\n\u201cThe current process includes answering a few questions so that we understand how their financial circumstances have been impacted by COVID-19,\u201d Ana Aujla, a spokeswoman for TD, told AFP by email.\n\nThe Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance allowed small businesses struggling because of the pandemic to reduce rent by at least 75 percent from April to July 2020, but no such scheme was established for residential leases.\n\nEvictions for late rent payment were banned in a number of provinces, but most moratoriums are coming to an end.", "lang": "en"}
