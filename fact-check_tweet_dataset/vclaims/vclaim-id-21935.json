Also the Senate, the Electoral College, the Supreme Court, borders, ICE, and more. When do we get to declare them enemies of the state?\u201d reads the full quote.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence that Russell ever made this statement.\n\nPolitical remarks have been misattributed to Russell in the past, sometimes stemming from Twitter users pretending to be the actor. This particular quote has appeared on social media since at least October. (RELATED: Did Kurt Russell Call Trump \u2018Dedicated And Determined\u2019?)\n\nAfter a search online, TheDCNF found no evidence Russell ever made the statement contained in the meme.\n\nOne version of the image, shared by the Facebook page We the People in October, features the same quote, but in a screenshot of a tweet. An unverified Twitter user claiming to be Russell sent the tweet, even using an image of him for a profile picture; however, Russell does not appear to have a presence on Twitter.\n\nRussell is a self-described libertarian who prefers to not talk publicly about politics. \u201cI have my political point of view, of course; I\u2019m an American and I\u2019m entitled to it. But I don\u2019t like espousing it publicly,\u201d he told The Daily Beast in 2015.\n\nWhile Russell has done his best to stay out of politics, he did make headlines in 2015 when during an interview he said that gun control wouldn\u2019t stop terrorism. \u201cIf you think gun control is going to change the terrorists\u2019 point of view, I think you\u2019re, like, out of your mind,\u201d he said.\n\nRussell is known for his roles in movies like \u201cTombstone\u201d and \u201cEscape from L.A.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
