This year the epidemic has lasted much longer than the previous years. A 16-year-old girl died from dengue on November 10, 2019 at a Delhi hospital.\n\nIndia has reported more than 67,377 cases of dengue fever and 48 deaths as of October 13, according to data released by the Directorate of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP).\n\nLike zika, chikungunya, yellow fever, dengue is a viral disease that spreads through mosquitoes. The virus uses the Aedes mosquitoes as a host and transfers into the human when the affected mosquito bites humans.\n\n\n\nDengue infection has no known cures but treatable symptomatically using evidence-based medications. Subsequently, many forms of alternative and misinformed treatments in India have emerged as a claim to cure and/or prevent dengue.\n\nAlt News Science counteracted another dengue-related claim about papaya extract \u2018Caripill\u2019 in our previous sci-check.\n\nApplication of coconut oil can be protective from dengue-infected mosquito bites due to its antibiotic properties.\n\nA viral message on social media and chat applications such as WhatsApp attributed to a doctor B Sukumar advises application of coconut oil in order to prevent dengue.\n\nSimilar claim was also made from the verified handle of Max Health Insurance, as well as an Indian news channel called News Nation.\n\nCoconut oil is not an antiviral compound and its application will not protect against dengue infection or dengue-mosquito bites.\n\nA: Limited evidence for coconut oil as an antibacterial against bacteria associated with dental caries and diarrhoea:\n\nTwo studies have conducted research (Peedikayil et al 2016; Shilling et al 2013) that the medium-chain fatty acids in coconut oil have antimicrobial properties. Both were preliminary studies that tested the effect of coconut oil on bacterial infections with dental caries and hospital-acquired diarrhoea. The bacteria associated with dental caries is Streptococcus mutans and with hospital-acquired diarrhoea is Clostridium difficile, both are distinct organisms as compared to the dengue virus.\n\nThus, limited evidence from preliminary studies of antibacterial activity does not translate to efficacy as antiviral activity.\n\nB: No evidence for coconut oil as an antiviral:\n\nNo studies were found that mentioned coconut oil as an effective antiviral agent. Since the dengue pathogen is a virus transmitted through Aedes mosquito bites, it cannot be protected against using coconut oil application.\n\nC: Evidence for Coconut oil as solvents for mosquito repellants:\n\nTwo studies (Sritabutra & Soonwera, 2013; Soonwera & Phasomkusolsil, 2015) mentioned the use of coconut oil application for dengue. In both instances, it was used as a solvent, similar to olive oil to dissolve other mosquito repellent oils. In both studies, there was no mention of coconut oil directly acting as a protective agent against dengue mosquito bites or, its alleged \u2018antiviral\u2019 properties.\n\nThere is no evidence that coconut oil can treat a virus infection in humans or prevent mosquito bites. It is dangerous to believe that it can stop the spread of dengue.\n\u2022 None\n\u2022 Peedikayil FC, Remy V, John S, Chandru TP, Sreenivasan P, Bijapur GA.
