Pence visited after being named to lead the revived National Space Council. REUTERS/Mike Brown\" (see here)\u200b\n\nThe article references Pence's tweet addressing the situation \u2013 it shows an edited version of the photograph, where everything but Marco Rubio's head with a red circle around him is blurred out. His tweet reads, \"Sorry @NASA...@MarcoRubio dared me to do it!\" (see here)\u200b\n\nPence caught on to the humorous response the tweet triggered. He followed up with another edited version of the photograph of him touching a porcupine instead of the hardware with the caption: \"Okay...so this isn't exactly the first time this has happened.\"\u200b (see here)\n\nMarco Rubio joined the teasing and responded to the tweet by saying: \"In fairness, I warned @VP that \"you break it, you own it\"\" (see here) \u200b\n\nNASA responded to the exchange by saying, \"It was OK to touch the surface. Those are just day-to-day reminder signs. We were going to clean it anyway. It was an honor to host you!\"\u200b (see here)\n\nThe 2017 photograph likely began to re-circulate on social media after President Trump announced Pence will be the lead in the response to the coronavirus response in the U.S. (see here ). Social media users are using this photograph as a way to question the Vice President\u2019s ability to perform adequately in this new role. Examples of this assumption can be seen here: here and here: here.\n\nThe original photograph of Pence touching the critical space flight hardware is authentic and was not edited in any way. It can be found on our website here. \u200bNASA confirmed this wasn\u2019t dangerous or inappropriate. VERDICT\n\nTrue: Mike Pence did touch the NASA hardware with the \u201cdo not touch\u201d sign on it, though this was not dangerous in any way", "lang": "en"}
