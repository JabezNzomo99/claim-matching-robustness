There\u2019s also no study that shows that it can stop or cure coronavirus. Currently, there is still no definitive cure or vaccine for covid-19; there are, however, ongoing pre-clinical and clinical trials.\n\nDespite unmasking several false claims about discovery of a cure for covid-19 in the last three months, purveyors of fake news are unrelenting even after several announcements that possible cures for or vaccines against covid-19 are still in clinical trials.\n\nA Facebook user took to his page recently to pronounce that palm oil, one of the famously used oils in Nigeria, can stop the spread of Covid-19.\n\nThe author gave a vivid instruction to potential users to take two spoonfuls of Palm oil daily to stop the spread of the virus.\n\nThe post named its source as experts and the WHO without the organizational logo or trademark as the case may be.\n\nElaeis Guineensis (Palm oil) is edible oil and one of the most common oils made from the fruit of the oil palm tree. That said, there has been no study that shows or approves the ingestion of palm oil as a way to stop the spread of covid-19. And palm oil has not been endorsed by any accredited research including the World Health Organization to be an approved measure to prevent covid-19 infection.\n\nThe post never gave details beyond the qualifier \u201cexpert\u201d as its source, making it impossible to verify the authenticity of the expertise behind the claim.\n\nIt is very unlikely that a respectable organization such as the WHO will confuse \u201cLOVED ONES\u201d for \u201cLOVE ONES\u201d as this post did; which also points out to the fact that the message in any way did not originate from the World Health Organization.\n\nTo halt the spread of a virus or bacteria is to take precautions to limit the movement of the virus from one location to another. This post, however, placed its emphasis on reducing the spread of coronavirus. But ingesting a drug has the effect of either curing or reducing the effect of an ailment in the human body; it is not a means to halting the spread of the infection or ailment.\n\nMoreover, there has been no study that shows the daily intake of two spoonfuls of palm oil can stop the spread of Covid-19. Again, the confusion of terms in the claim raises suspicion about the competence of the author and calls the claim to for scrutiny. No authoritative source on medical matters will confuse the difference between preventive techniques and medications for the treatment of an existing ailment.\n\nThe WHO\u2019s guidance to the spread of the virus.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) remains the apex authority on information regarding this pandemic and related ongoing trials and prevention strategies. At no point, however, did the WHO announce palm oil as a possible way to halt the spread of the virus.\n\nAccording to the WHO\u2019s information service that provides the latest information and guidance on Covid-19, the guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus include:\n\u2022 Covering of your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze;\n\u2022 Staying at home if you feel unwell \u2013 even with a slight fever and cough;\n\u2022 Seeking immediate medical care if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing.\n\nIngesting two spoons full of palm oil, daily will not stop the spread or cure of Covid-19. Dubawa implores the public to ignore this post to avoid history repeating itself. Let\u2019s remember the consequences of salt intake during the Ebola period.", "lang": "en"}
