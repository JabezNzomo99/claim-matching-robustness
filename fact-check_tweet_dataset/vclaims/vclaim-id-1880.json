It found that the median pensioner household in Great Britain is now \u00a320 a week better off compared to the median working-age household after housing costs are included. We\u2019ve asked for a bit more detail on this figure.\n\nA much higher proportion of pensioners own their own home (and so face minimal housing costs) than those among the working-age population. For this reason the report points out that average working-age incomes before housing costs remain above those of pensioners.\n\nPensioners here refers to anyone of State Pension age or over, so some may not be claiming their pension yet and may still be in work.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies had similar findings in 2015 when they said that the median income among pensioners, after housing costs, was 5% ahead of the typical non-pensioner. They put the change down to growing private pension pots and increasing state support.\n\nThe Intergenerational Commission also cautions against reading too much into whether having higher incomes after housing costs means that average pensioner households have a higher standard of living.\n\nIt points to things like the fact that pensioners may experience a higher level of inflation than working-age groups (although it said this hasn\u2019t been the case in recent years). But, it also notes aspects that might push up pensioners\u2019 living standards, such as paying less for things like transport and leisure activities.", "lang": "en"}
