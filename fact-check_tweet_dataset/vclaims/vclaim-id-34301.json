The government denied that the move came as a direct fallout of his critical reportage and tweeted that Taseer had \u2018concealed\u2019 his father\u2019s Pakistani identity \u2013 a claim refuted by the journalist.\n\nMainstream media outlets \u2013 Zee News, Republic TV, OneIndia \u2013 have claimed in recent reports that Taseer has moved the Supreme Court against the government\u2019s action. Republic TV\u2019s report is no longer available.\n\nZee Hindustan was one of the firsts to claim that Taseer filed a petition in the SC to challenge the revocation of his OCI card (archive).\n\nWebsite News Nation also published an article claiming the same. So did Russian news organisation Sputnik.\n\nAatish Taseer quote-tweeted the report by Zee News and termed the story \u201cfake news\u201d. Speaking with Alt News, the journalist and author said, \u201cWe have not filed a petition at the Supreme Court. We are still in the process of preparing our legal strategy.\u201d\n\nIn a November 12 report in The Hindu, Taseer said that he will be challenging the cancellation of his OCI status however the report has no mention of the due process. He told the media outlet. \u201cI have had some hesitations given the huge costs and the long delays in a legal battle. But so many people have reached out and told me that if I don\u2019t fight what the government has done, I would be letting them get away with it.\u201d\n\nThat same day, the journalist had tweeted \u201cit\u2019s true, we\u2019re fighting\u201d with again, no mention of the SC.\n\nMultiple media outlets therefore falsely reported that Aatish Taseer has filed a petition in the Supreme Court, challenging the revocation of his OCI status. It remains unclear what prompted the premature reports.", "lang": "en"}
