Let\u2019s try to find the authenticity of the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Indian Government under Modi has cleared its debt to world bank. Fact: Akbaruddin\u2019s tweet talks about India clearing its dues related to its contibution to the UN, not the loans availed from the World bank. On World bank\u2019s website it can be seen that India has to pay a few billion dollars to the World bank. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nFrom the tweet made by Syed Akbaruddin, India permanent representative to the UN, it can be understood that India has cleared its dues to the United Nations. Every country contributes a certain amount of money for the UN\u2019s budget and India has paid its share to the UN. There is no relation between India\u2019s contribution to the UN and India\u2019s outstanding debt with the World bank. More information about India\u2019s outstanding debt to the world bank can be found on the world bank\u2019s website. For various projects, India has taken a few billion dollars of debt from different groups of world bank\u2014IBRD (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development), IDA (International Development Association), and IFC (International Finance Corporation). Project wise details can be found on world bank\u2019s website. There is no truth in the information that these debts are all cleared by Modi.\n\n\n\nTo conclude, India cleared its contribution related dues to the UN and this is being shared as India clearing its outstanding debts to the world bank. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
