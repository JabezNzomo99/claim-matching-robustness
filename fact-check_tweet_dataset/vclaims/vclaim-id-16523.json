However, the mortality rate for black infants in 2014, 10.93 per 1,000 live births, was nearly twice the overall U.S. rate of 5.82 per 1,000.\n\nMeasuring a longer period of time, from 2011 to 2015, the overall infant mortality rate in Mahoning County was 8.8 but the rate for African Americans was nearly double: 16.9 per 1,000 live births. (Iran was below 16.9 each year from 2011 to 2015, according to the U.N. data.)\n\n\u201cBlack infants in America are now more than twice as likely to die as white infants \u2014 11.3 per 1,000 black babies, compared with 4.9 per 1,000 white babies, according to the most recent government data \u2014 a racial disparity that is actually wider than in 1850, 15 years before the end of slavery, when most black women were considered chattel,\u201d the New York Times magazine reported in 2018.\n\n\u201cOne of the clear factors that we\u2019re seeing from data coming out is that there is a difference in the way various races are institutionally treated,\u201d said Rahul Gupta, chief medical and health officer at the nonprofit March of Dimes. \u201cThe perception that you are of a different race does matter where your health care is concerned.\u201d\n\nAccess to health care makes a big difference, Gupta said. The Affordable Care Act gives states the option to expand their Medicaid programs but not all have taken up the offer. A study published in April by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) analyzed the impact of expanding Medicaid on infant mortality rates. This peer-reviewed study, led by researcher Clare C. Brown, concluded that \u201cstate Medicaid expansion was not associated with differences in rates of low birth weight or preterm birth outcomes overall but was associated with improvements in relative disparities for black infants compared with white infants among the states that expanded compared with those that did not.\u201d\n\nJames W. Collins Jr. of Northwestern University and Richard David, who at the time was a doctor at Cook County Hospital in Chicago, analyzed 103,072 white and black births in Chicago in the early 1980s and found that socioeconomic status alone did not explain away the disparity in low birth weights for black infants. (Again, low birth weight is a leading cause of death for infants.)\n\n\u201cHowever, the majority of the data is pointing us to these societal factors as greater contributors,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cWhat we learned and we\u2019re learning more is that there are a tremendous amount of societal factors that perhaps have a much greater impact in the manner that health care is provided. Therefore, it\u2019s very important for us to understand, when it comes to infant mortality and maternal mortality, obviously, we are one of the worst nations in the developed world, and it\u2019s directly related to the systems we have built, access to care, and a whole host of other societal issues. To a large, extent these are factors that are preventable, needless and really a patient safety issue.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
