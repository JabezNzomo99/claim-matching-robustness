Another 6.1 magnitude earthquake struck the same area just hours later, shaking buildings as far away as Bangkok and Hanoi.\n\nThe photos were also published here on Facebook with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is misleading; two photos in the post were published online in August in reports about damage caused by landslides Huaphan, a province in northeastern Laos, in August 2019.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found that the first photo of the collapsed green house was published here by InsideLaos, a Laos-based community news site, in its August 5 report on the landslides in Huaphan.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo in the misleading Facebook post (L) and the photo in the InsideLaos report (R):\n\nPart of the Laos-language report translates to English as: \"[The storm] has caused severe flooding and landslides in several villages in Huaphan and Luang Prabang provinces. At least 11 people have been confirmed missing.\u201d\n\nThe landslides in Huaphan were also reported on here by the Vientiane Times, an English language Laos-based news site. The article\u2019s first paragraph reads: \u201cHeavy rain has affected the area since August 3 and seven people are still missing after a landslide.\u201d\n\nAnother reverse image search for the misleading post\u2019s second photo found this high-quality YouTube video that was published on August 16, 2019.\n\nThe video\u2019s caption reads: \u201cIn Laos, the house on the banks of the lake has become horrendous.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the YouTube video:\n\nReverse image searches for the other two photos in the misleading post found the images in media reports about the November 21 earthquakes.\n\nBoth images appear in this report published by M2F, a Thai-language tabloid on November 21, 2019.\n\nBelow are screenshot comparisons from the article (L) and the images in the Facebook post (R):\n\nThe two images were also published in several other articles about the earthquake; for instance here in a report by Chinese state media outlet CCTV on November 21; and here in a report by Bangkok-based newspaper The Nation on November 21.", "lang": "en"}
