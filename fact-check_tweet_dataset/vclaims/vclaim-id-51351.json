This account had 1,637 followers at the time this story was published. Another account we found was called \u2018iasaishwaryasheoran\u2019 and had two posts, both photos which we saw in the other accounts, and had been posted in the evening on 5 August.\n\nIn the first photo in one of the accounts, \u2018Sheoran\u2019 said that she was returning to Instagram after a period of two years, but we found some users saying that the account was fake in the comments of the post.\n\nMoreover, we found that the photos used in all the accounts were publicly available from Sheoran\u2019s modelling and Miss India days and that all these accounts named above seemed to have started posting on 4 August 2020, which is when the UPSC results were announced.\n\nFurther, The Quint reached out to Sheoran, who confirmed that none of these accounts belonged to her. \u201cI\u2019ve said it in all the interviews that I am not on any social media platform. All the handles on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram are all fake,\u201d Sheoran said, adding that she had not returned to any of the platforms since her news had broken either. She also said that some of these accounts had come to her notice as well and that these fake accounts could become an issue for her as well.", "lang": "en"}
