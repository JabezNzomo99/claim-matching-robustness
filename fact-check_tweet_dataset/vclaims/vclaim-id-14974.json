The man in the picture is former Indian National Congress MLA Ram Dayal Uike, who had joined the BJP last year.\n\nThe fake post was also debunked by Alt News.\n\nThe post was shared on Facebook pages Feku Express and Mangalore Voice, and was subsequently tweeted and shared by several social media users, several of them being verified Twitter handles.\n\nWhile Feku Express issued a clarification regarding sharing the piece of fake news, Mangalore Voice is yet to issue any statement. The archived version of the post can be accessed here.\n\nSeveral prominent Indian journalists also tweeted the image with the misleading claim. However, most of the tweets have been now deleted and clarifications issued, barring few exceptions.\n\nJournalist Sourav Datta, who had shared a screenshot of the Mangalore Voice's post, later deleted it and issued a clarification. Others too, including Nidhi Razdan, Swati Chaturvedi, Sadanand Dhume, who had quote-tweeted Datta, deleted their tweets and issued clarifications regarding the same.\n\nHowever, there are others like Aam Aadmi Party leader Sanjay Singh who are yet to delete the tweet or issue clarification.\n\nThe archived version of the tweet can be accessed here.\n\nThe viral post had claimed that former judge Ravinder Reddy had joined BJP. Reddy had was in the news in April last year when he had acquitted five persons - including preacher Swami Aseemanand - in the Mecca Masjid blast case in Hyderabad in March 2007. Back then, Reddy had also expressed his keenness to join the BJP.\n\nHowever, the man being greeted by Shah in the photo is not Ravinder Reddy. More importantly, Reddy has not joined the BJP. The man in question here is Ram Dayal Uike, a Congress MLA from Chhattisgarh. Uike had shifted base from BJP to Congress in 2000, and is a popular tribal face in Chhattisgarh. He joined BJP in October 2018.\n\nThe full report can be accessed here.\n\nRavinder Reddy is a former judge. He had presided over the Mecca Masjid blast case and acquitted preacher Aseemanand and four others on April 16 2018.\n\nWithin hours of delivering the judgement, Reddy had resigned citing personal reasons. Later, he expressed keenness to join BJP but things did not materialise and Reddy later joined the Telangana Jana Samiti (TJS), founded by activist M Kodandaram. TJS was a part of the Congress-led grand alliance against the Telangana Rashtra Samithi ahead of the Assembly elections held in 2018.\n\nA report published in The Hindu about the ex-judge joining TJS can be read here.", "lang": "en"}
