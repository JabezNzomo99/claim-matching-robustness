The video was tweeted with the caption \u2018Can you pick up a 40-tonne truck with 2,000 drones?Credit to @ScaniaGroup.\u2018 It has received over 15,000 re-tweets and over 69,000 likes.\n\nSince then many people have uploaded or shared the same video on social media.\n\nLeaving many puzzled about the capabilities of present-day drone technology.\n\nSeveral people, including Giuliano Liguori, founder of GLWEB, an Italy-based Italy-based engineering company, were quick to point out that the video in question is made using CGI (computer-generated imagery).\n\nScania, a Sweden-based commercial vehicles manufacturer, has uploaded multiple videos which involve drones lifting trucks. One of them is uploaded on YouTube as \u2018Scania truck lifted by drones\u2019 where the use of CGI is obvious. As per PRNewswire, they signed an agreement with Bublar Group\u2019s subsidiary Vobling for services related to CGI, augmented reality and virtual reality on September 27.\n\nBut the video in question seems is produced in a way so that it looks like it is shot on a smartphone which adds to the confusion. However, the fact that Scania staff appear to be standing just a few feet away from an 18,000-kilogram truck hanging in the air does raise suspicion because of the lack of safety standards for the employees.\n\nIn an attempt to authenticate the video in question, Alt News searched the phrase \u2018Can you pick up a 40-tonne truck with 2,000 drones?\u2019 on Facebook and found that the video in question was shared by the verified account of Scania Group on September 25.\n\nInterestingly, the same video was uploaded a month earlier than Scania Group\u2019s post on a YouTube by an account named Trucks & Funs.\n\nThe Facebook post by Scania Group also used the same phrase \u2018Can you pick up a 40-tonne truck with 2,000 drones?\u2019 but if you click the \u2018See more\u2019 button one can see the following text \u2018Learn more: http://bit.ly/2lC0LnH\u2019\n\nThe link takes you to a webpage called Future Room, a platform where futuristic ideas and concepts are discussed on Scania\u2019s global website. At the bottom of the page, there is a video \u2018Scania truck lifted by drones\u2019 followed by other videos which capture \u2018discussions and engaging stories that imagine a better future through innovation.\u2019 Therefore it is clear that ideas shown in the videos on this section of the website are futuristic and do not represent currently available technology.\n\nHowever, the video in question is being shared on social media without the link by Scania which has resulted in many people believing that the video is real.\n\nThe ten-second or six-second video made by Scania that shows a truck being lifted by multiple drones is a CGI video and is being shared without context.\n\nThere have been several instances in past when a CGI video was considered to be real. In February, Alt News reported CGI video by Russian inventor viral as Israeli drones supplied to India and digitally-created video viral as \u2018robot\u2019 used by US to take down IS chief Baghdadi.", "lang": "en"}
