The claim is false; the video has circulated in media reports since at least December 2018 about a Chinese police officer pinning down a drunk Chinese woman at a hotel in Shenzhen, China.\n\nThe 41-second video was published here on Facebook on December 18, 2019. It has been viewed more than 138,000 times and shared more than 4,000 times.\n\nThe post's Indonesian-language caption translates to English as: \u201cMake it viral\u2026 share as many times as you can\u2026... !!!!!!!!!\n\n\u201cStrangling a woman\u2019s neck with his knee, it\u2019s as if this Chinese policeman is saying, \u2018It\u2019s your turn soon, just wait\u2019.\n\n\u201cMy friends\u2026 this is how the Chinese communists treat a Uighur Muslim woman caught praying\u2026\n\n Source: American media.\u201d\n\nBelow is the screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe same video was also published on Facebook here, here and here with a similar claim, and has subsequently received more than 147,000 views.\n\nBeijing has been accused of running camps and prisons to detain ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang, China\u2019s far northwest region. Campaigners claim more than one million people could have been held in the detention camps, as reported by AFP here on November 13, 2019.\n\nA Google reverse image search of a keyframe extracted from the video found this report published by the South China Morning Post (SCMP), a Hong Kong-based English-language newspaper, on December 10, 2018.\n\nThe report\u2019s headline states: \u201cChinese police accused of brutality by kneeling on woman\u2019s neck \u2013 next day she thanks their \u2018sincere assistance\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe report's first three paragraphs read: \u201cA video of a Chinese policeman pinning down a woman by the neck with his knee while she cries out in pain has caused a furious reaction online, with the police accused of being \u2018shameless, hypocritical and evasive\u2019 and of trying to control public opinion.\n\n\u201cThe woman posted the video on social media on Saturday and accused the police of brutality, but it was swiftly deleted and on Sunday she posted another statement thanking the police for \u2018their sincere communication and assistance\u2019, claiming the issue had been resolved and asking people to stop commenting.\n\n\u201cIdentified by her surname Cheng, she had called the police after claiming a security guard at her hotel in the southern city of Shenzhen had been taking photographs of her, she wrote on Weibo, China\u2019s Twitter-like platform.\u201d\n\nThe report also posted a screenshot of the video with caption: \u201cA still from the video showing a Shenzhen policeman pinning down a woman by the neck with his knee.\u201d\n\nBelow is the screenshot of the SCMP report:\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading posts (L) and the video in the SCMP report (R):\n\nLuohu is a district in Shenzhen, a city in China\u2019s southern province of Guangdong, just across the border with Hong Kong.\n\nMailOnline, the website of UK tabloid The Daily Mail, also published a report about the case on December 11, 2018, here, headlined: \u201cChinese policeman pins down a drunk woman by putting his knee on her neck, sparking public anger over police brutality.\u201d\n\nThe report includes a longer version of the video in the misleading post in better quality.\n\nA Chinese-speaking journalist in AFP\u2019s Hong Kong bureau translated the policeman's comments in the video. He can be heard saying to the people filming the incident: \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d and \u201cGive me your phone.\u201d\n\nOn December 9, 2018, Shenzhen\u2019s Luohu district police published this statement on their Weibo account about the incident, stating they received a report from a hotel in Luohu district about a dispute caused by a drunk woman identified as Cheng, 23, at about 1:18 am on December 8.\n\nThe statement said in part: \u201cShe suspected the hotel security guard of taking photos of her and the two had a dispute. After police mediation was unsuccessful at the scene, the two were brought to the police station. They later cleared up the misunderstanding after mediation and left the station on their own accord.\n\n\u201cAt around 03:06 am, the border police station received a report from the same hotel again, saying that the drunk woman came to the hotel lobby requesting to check the surveillance footage. After receiving the call, the police quickly rushed to the scene and took the footage from the surveillance room. The police also told Cheng and her two friends that the CCTV footage involves other people\u2019s privacy and requested them to wait outside until the related footage was obtained. Cheng couldn't understand and pushed and hit the police. After warnings which turned out to be futile, the police restricted her with bare hands. During the course of action, Cheng fiercely resisted, kicked and hit the police. Police put her under control and brought her back to the station.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
