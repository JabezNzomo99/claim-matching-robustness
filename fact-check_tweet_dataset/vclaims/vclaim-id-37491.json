The image is an actually an optical illusion made by a graphic designer from Ukraine that he posted online in 2016.\n\nThis version on Facebook was shared about 180,000 times in the first six weeks after being published on November 22, 2018.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Facebook post:\n\nHere is a similar version on Twitter and below is its screenshot.\n\nThe posts claim this image was created by a Japanese neurologist to test a person\u2019s level of stress: if one is calm, it will not move, if one is stressed, it will move a bit. But if one is very stressed, that person will see it moving like a carousel.\n\nA reverse search traces the image, however, to this photo on Shutterstock, a stock photography company.\n\nThe image in the Shutterstock website was posted under the account named \u201cGuten Tag Vector\u201d. AFP checked the profile of the account, where Guten Tag Vector\u2019s Twitter account and email address were posted.\n\nA search of the Twitter ID he posted, @yurrey_p, revealed his name and background: Yurii Perepadia, a graphic designer from Ukraine.\n\nAFP found him also on Facebook and asked him about the image.\n\n\u201cThis image is one of the best selling. Make it was not very hard. At that time I already had experience working with Adobe Illustrator\u201d, he told AFP via Facebook messenger on January 10.\n\nPerepadia told AFP he created it in 2016. Several posts confirm the image did go online that year.\n\nBelow is a tweet of the image time-stamped September 26, 2016:\n\nHere is another 2016 post of the image on depositphotos.com,a commercial platform for photographers, illustrators, graphic designers and their clients.\n\nThe posts with the false claim have been shared from November 2018 on different social media platforms by accounts from countries including the United States, the Philippines, Spain and Turkey.", "lang": "en"}
