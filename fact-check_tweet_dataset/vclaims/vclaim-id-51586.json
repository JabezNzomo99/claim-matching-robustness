A list of 125 people circulating on social media claims A-list celebrities like Oprah Winfrey, Charlie Sheen, Steven Spielberg, Madonna and politicians were on Epstein's flight logs and went to his island is fake. The flight logs that are in the public domain do not show 40 of the Hollywood stars that the fake list claims traveled on the infamous plane to Epstein's Caribbean island.\n\nThe claim appeared as a post (archived here) where it was published on Facebook. It opened:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nHere is a screengrab of the list:\n\nThe list claiming to be \"Epstein Flight Log\" with 125 celebrities and politicians exposed as having been on Epstein's plane, dubbed Lolita Express is fake, and 40 of the celebrities and politicians listed do not appear on the Epstein flight logs.\n\nThe flight logs are handwritten by pilot David Rogers and were obtained by reporters in January 2015 after they were filed as an exhibit in a federal lawsuit. You can download them and check them here:\n\nThe flight logs detail trips taken between 1997 and 2005 and included former President Bill Clinton, lawyer Alan Dershowitz, Kevin Spacey, Chris Tucker, former Harvard president Larry Summers, Casey Wasserman, billionaire Ron Burkle (spelled incorrectly as Burke), former national security advisor Sandy Berger, and Virginia Roberts - the woman who claims she was a sex victim of Epstein. Jeffrey Epstein is on the list twice and Ghislane Maxwell is also on the list.\n\nHere is the list of people who do not appear on the cross-referenced list of the Epstein flight logs. Some celebrities are listed by their stage names with their real name in parentheses and other celebrities are listed by their stage names:\n\nCourtney Love and Alec Baldwin both appeared in Epstein's \"Black Book\" of phone numbers, Vanity Fair previously reported.\n\nThe fake Epstein logs have increased on social media in the last few months. Chrissy Teigen furiously shut down the claims on her Twitter account.\n\nShe fought back in since deleted Tweets after one person write to her, \"You're on the flight log. #GislaineMaxwell #EpsteinIsland,\" responding: \"if we wanna play with your lie just for fun, do you understand that if I were on the flight for the date of this 'manifest', I'd be a victim.\"\n\nEpstein's plane, a large Boeing 727 built in 1969 and carrying the tail number N908JE, never landed on Little St. James Island, which is only a 75-acre retreat southeast of St. Thomas, according to the Associated Press. Epstein would take a helicopter from the airport in St. Thomas, locals claimed.\n\nAs Lead Stories previously reported, Clinton did not ever land on Epstein's Caribbean island, but did travel on the plane around the world.\n\nFact Check: Epstein Flight Logs Do NOT Record Bill Clinton Visiting 'Pedo-Island'\n\n \n\nHere are other stories about Jeffery Epstein that Lead Stories has been debunking:\n\nFact Check: Jane Doe V.
