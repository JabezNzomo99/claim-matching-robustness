A man wearing a skull cap runs to the front of the crowd and wails that Amit Shah and Narendra Modi have died.\n\n\n\nThe viral clip is being shared with the caption which when translated claims, \"look at their mentality after Amit Shah ji tested positive for COVID-19 they are removing a funeral procession celebrating.\"\n\nClick here to view, and here for an archive.\n\nClick here to view, and here for an archive.\n\nWe searched on Facebook with the same caption and found that the video was viral with the misleading claim.\n\nClick here to view, and here for an archive.\n\nAlso Read: No, Pakistan Did Not Hold A Mock Funeral For Modi: A FactCheck\n\nWe found that the viral clip dates back to December 2019, and is not recent after Amit Shah announced that he had tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nWe found the same video posted on December 21, 2019 when we searched for the words 'Amit Shah mar gaya' (Amit Shah has died)\n\n\n\nClick here to view, and here for an archive.\n\nOn comparing the sequence of events in this video and the viral clip, we found that both were the same.\n\nAdditionally, in the video on the barricades, we spotted ''Kolkata Traffic Police' written at the 14 seconds timestamp, which shows that the video is from Kolkata, West Bengal.\n\nOne can also hear the crowd of protesters chanting 'Azaadi' (freedom), which indicates that it could be an anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA) protest. Several protests were held across the country against the CAA in December 2019.\n\n\n\nAmit Shah had taken to Twitter on August 2, 2020, announcing that after witnessing the initial symptoms of COVID-19 he got tested and the report had come back positive.\n\n\n\nBOOM could not independently verify the incident, however we could confirm that the viral is old and not recent as is being claimed.\n\nAlso Read: Also Read:No, Amit Shah Did Not Order CBI Probe Into Sushant Singh Rajput's Death", "lang": "en"}
