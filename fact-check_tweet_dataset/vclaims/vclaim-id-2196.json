Couric, when the show went to commercial, asked Clinton how she had been doing personally since the election. Her response not only surprised Couric but also a booth technician named Myron Beetlethong. Beetlethong, who was listening curiously and recording for posterity, caught this: \u201cI\u2019m not bad. That f*cking orange baboon stole my legacy and that n*gger Obama will make sure I\u2019m forgotten. I\u2019m just dandy. (notable, audible laughter.)\u201d\n\nThe article went on to assert that tale was unprovable (naturally), because the videotape documenting the alleged verbal outburst was seized by Clinton\u2019s hired \u201cgoons\u201d:\n\n\u201cThey came in with official looking badges and demanded all of the sound and video footage. I told them it was property of CBS, but they insisted that since Clinton\u2019s interview will never air that the network had no right to it. I tried to say no but they just pushed me aside and took what they wanted.\u201d\n\nNone of this was true. Our Land of the Free\u2019s claim about Clinton\u2019s using racist slurs on a \u201chot mic\u201d was quite similar to a November 2016 piece from the fake news site America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, which told a similarly false story about Clinton disparaging the music of popular singer Beyonce using racial slurs. The Our Land of the Free web site (just like the America\u2019s Last Line of Defense web site) carries disclaimers noting that the site\u2019s content is satirical material aimed at conservatives:\n\nOurlandofthefree.com makes no guarantee that anything you find here will be based at all in reality.
