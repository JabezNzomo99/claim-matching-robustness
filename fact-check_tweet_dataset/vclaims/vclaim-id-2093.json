One of them, published on May 16 and headlined \u201cThis is Why North Korea Demonstrates its Military Capability to the World,\u201d quoted Alexander Vorontsov, head of the Department of Korea and Mongolia at the Russian Academy of Sciences\u2019 Institute of Oriental Studies.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea cannot make concessions on this issue because their opponents will interpret them as a manifestation of weakness and further result in increased pressure on the country,\u201d Vorontsov was quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cHe [Kim Jong-un] has no other choice, he still hopes that sooner or later there will be some conditions for normal negotiations, [where Pyongyang will be able to speak] not from a weak position, but as an equal participant. For this reason it demonstrates its military capabilities,\u201d Vorontsov said.\n\nOn April 5, a day after North Korea test-fired a medium-range ballistic missile that reached the Sea of Japan, Russia\u2019s RIA Novosti state news agency published an article in which Vorontsov was quoted repeating the line Pyongyang uses to justify nuclear missile tests.\n\nNoting that U.S. and South Korean forces were conducting annual joint military exercises in South Korea, Vorontsov told RIA Novosti \u201cthere are thousands and thousands of soldiers who in the course of those exercises every day are firing different weapons, launching various types of missiles. The Northerners perceive that as a threat \u2026 and demonstrate that they are ready to uncompromisingly defend themselves against any aggression, and that they have something to protect themselves with.\u201d\n\nThe claim that North Korea has not been given the opportunity for \u201cnormal negotiations\u201d is false, experts told Polygraph.info.\n\n\u201cThe blame for failure to negotiate an agreement to reassure North Korea and achieve a nuclear free Korean peninsula is almost entirely the DPRK\u2019s fault,\u201d said Gary Samore, executive director for research of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government.\n\nVorontsov\u2019s view, that \u201cPyongyang believes it must have nuclear weapons and missiles to defend itself from external threats, including the United States,\u201d might be correct, Samore said.\n\n\u201cHowever, I also think that previous efforts by presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama to negotiate agreements with Pyongyang all failed because North Korea cheated or reneged on the agreements,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cU.S. diplomats and envoys have repeatedly attempted to engage with North Korean counterparts but all attempts were rejected by the regime,\u201d Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, told Polygraph.info. \u201cPyongyang closed the \u2018New York Channel\u2019 \u2013 the last official government-to-government link between the U.S. and North Korea \u2013 last July, and previously severed the means for inter-Korean dialogue.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has made stopping the development of a North Korean ICBM a top priority, and stressed the U.S. would consider military action to take out launching sites and nuclear facilities, if needed.\n\nKlingner noted that North Korea has not upheld its promise not to pursue nuclear weapons.\n\n\u201cIn four international agreements, North Korea promised to never pursue nuclear weapons,\u201d he said. \u201cPyongyang subsequently agreed in four additional agreements to abandon the nuclear weapons they promised to never build in the first place. All of those attempts at negotiations failed, as did U.S. and other nations\u2019 attempts at two-party, three-party, four-party, and six-party negotiations.\u201d\n\nSouth Korea has 240 inter-Korean agreements with Pyongyang, and has provided large-scale economic aid to North Korea and promised far more, Klingner noted. \u201cAll of those efforts failed to induce political and economic reform in North Korea or to moderate the regime\u2019s belligerent foreign policy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe UN Security Council has adopted several resolutions stating that North Korea must abandon its nuclear and missile programs in a complete, verifiable, and irreversible manner.\n\n\u201cPyongyang is in defiance of all of those resolutions, as well as transgressions against U.S. and international law through its various illicit activities,\u201d Klingner said.", "lang": "en"}
