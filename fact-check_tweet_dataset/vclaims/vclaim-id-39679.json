(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nAfter searching online and in the Nexis news archive, we couldn\u2019t find this statistic in any news coverage. So we started reaching out to California officials.\n\nSam Mahood, a spokesperson for California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, told us he couldn\u2019t comment on how many Californians declined jury duty on citizenship grounds \u2014 that\u2019s not the office\u2019s purview \u2014 but he said it\u2019s not true that 449,000 noncitizens were registered to vote.\n\nHere\u2019s what else you should know about potential jurors in California.\n\nFirst, people who are summoned for jury duty don\u2019t \"turn it down,\" said Blaine Corren, a public affairs analyst for the Judicial Council of California. Rather, they can be excused from jury duty for various reasons, or a court can disqualify them from serving based on a number of factors including not being 18 or older, having a felony conviction on their record or for not being a citizen of the United States.\n\nThe council collects statewide data on how many people were excused or disqualified and why \u2014 with some caveats. That information comes to the council from individual trial courts but since there\u2019s no requirement that courts provide this data, some courts and categories may be missing in the Jury Data Reports the council produces.\n\nThe data the state keeps on why someone was excused from jury duty includes financial hardship and physical or mental disabilities, but not citizenship status. The Judicial Council of California does, however, keep track of how many people were disqualified for jury duty because they\u2019re not citizens.\n\nWe requested the council\u2019s reports through the most recent fiscal year for which a completed report is available, which was July 2017-June 2018. Our analysis shows that, annually, around 1 million people \u2014 citizens and noncitizens \u2014 are disqualified from jury duty in California. Approximately half aren\u2019t citizens.\n\nFrom July 2008 through June 2017, about 11.3 million people were disqualified. Of those, about 4.7 million were disqualified for not being a U.S. citizen.\n\nIn 2017-2018, 1,063,784 people overall were disqualified with 425,814 for not being citizens. But it was fiscal year 2016-17 that has a figure that comes closest to the claim in the Facebook post: Among 1,096,478 people who were disqualified for jury duty that year, 449,404 were disqualified for not being U.S. citizens.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that those rejected juror candidates were registered to vote.\n\nOne of the primary sources courts use to summon jurors is the voter registration list, Corren said. The other is the state Department of Motor Vehicles\u2019 list of licensed drivers and identification card holders in the area served by the court. Noncitizens, such as lawful permanent residents, can get driver\u2019s licenses. As of 2015, undocumented immigrants in California can, too. So it follows that noncitizens \u2014 both lawful permanent residents and undocumented immigrants \u2014 would be summoned for jury duty as courts tap potential jurors from DMV data.\n\n\"These two lists are considered inclusive of a representative cross-section of the population, according to the California Code of Civil Procedure,\" Corren said. But, he added, courts could seek jurors from other sources like telephone directories and utility company lists.\n\nIn Nevada County, Calif., for example, 97 potential jurors were excused because they weren\u2019t citizens, said Jason Galkin, court executive officer of the Superior Court there. Galkin said the county tapped them from a list it got from the DMV. But searching for their names on the voter registration list, he said, there were no matches.\n\nIn fiscal year 2017-2018, three Sierra County residents were dismissed from jury duty because they weren\u2019t citizens but none of them were registered voters, said Jean-Anne Cheatham, a court assistant there.\n\nKaren Dalton, a spokesperson for the San Diego County Superior Court, told us most courts in California use the DMV\u2019s driver\u2019s license database as its primary source for the jury master list and then augment that with the voter registrar's list. In California, noncitizens can get driver\u2019s licenses so, again, it follows that noncitizens would appear for jury duty in San Diego County, among others.\n\nThe DMV has a \"motor voter\" program that automatically registers eligible driver\u2019s license applicants unless they opt out. Sometimes, Corren said, people will inadvertently mark themselves down to register to vote and it\u2019s possible that the lists courts receive from the DMV include these individuals. That information also goes to the California Secretary of State\u2019s office to determine whether to add them to the voter rolls, according to Corren. The office then reviews the lists and cancels requests to register to vote from people who aren\u2019t eligible, he said.\n\nThree Republican voters recently sued Secretary of State Padilla over the \"motor voter\" program, claiming that the state enables voter fraud by failing to investigate voters\u2019 citizenship status, Courthouse News Service reported on Oct. 1.\n\nSince the DMV started automatically registering people to vote in April 2018, it acknowledged making 105,000 processing errors out of more than 2.4 million, according to a January Sacramento Bee story, and at least one noncitizen came forward to say he was improperly added to the voter rolls. But that doesn\u2019t mean that 105,000 noncitizens cast ballots. Sam Mahood, with the secretary of state\u2019s office, told us he doesn\u2019t know of any recent convictions for noncitizens registering to vote.\n\nIt\u2019s also a far cry from the Facebook post\u2019s claim: that 449,000 noncitizens were registered voters who had also been summoned for jury duty and turned it down.", "lang": "en"}
