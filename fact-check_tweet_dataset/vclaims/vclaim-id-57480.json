If you do not have one, or your plan is not up-to date, please consult your doctor as soon as possible,\u201d the foundation\u2019s statement states.\n\nReuters debunked the same claim made by a UK Facebook user on March 21. The Reuters article pointed to a statement from Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Board. \u201cCovid-19 (Coronavirus) is a new virus and there is very limited information on the use of steroids in the treatment of this illness,\u201d reads the statement.\n\n\u201cThis is not an appropriate treatment for most people with respiratory conditions. Rescue packs should only be used by those people who have previously been prescribed them to manage flare ups of COPD as part of their agreed management plan,\u201d reads the statement.\n\nBoth the Marton Medical Practice in Blackpool (UK) and Lower Clapton Group Practice in London also addressed the fake posts. \u201cPlease do not contact your GP practice for a rescue pack. You should continue to manage your condition in the usual way and if you feel you have symptoms of COVID-19, go to before doing anything else,\u201d their websites state.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the Facebook post to be misleading. \u201cRescue packs\u201d containing steroids and antibiotics are a UK scheme available only to certain people. The federal Department of Health confirmed that people in Australia with pre-existing COPD conditions can only access a \u201crescue pack\u201d of medication if it has been previously prescribed. False \u2013 The claims of the content are factually inaccurate. NOTE: This article was updated on March 30 at 18.59 AEST to include a response from the federal Department of Health, which clarifies that medication contained in \u201crescue packs\u201d is only available under an existing prescription. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://factcheck.aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
