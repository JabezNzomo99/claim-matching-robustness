It reduces the income taxes owed by low- and moderate-income workers, or enables them to collect a tax refund.\n\n\"You know who had a really bad idea? Governor Walker,\" she said.\n\n\"He did just the opposite, cutting taxes for the wealthiest and raising them on 140,000 Wisconsin families.\"\n\nIs that Walker\u2019s record on taxes?\n\nLet\u2019s start with \"cutting taxes for the wealthiest,\" the first part of Burke\u2019s claim.\n\nHis first state budget, for 2011-\u201913, plus other measures adopted in 2011, provided tax cuts to corporations, businesses, manufacturers and investors, among other groups. The Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the nonpartisan scorekeeper on state budget matters, their value at over 10 years.\n\nThe largest tax cut, done through tax credits for production earnings of manufacturers and agricultural businesses, helps not only corporations but also individual owners of smaller businesses.\n\nIndeed, we rated a claim that the credits would enable a factory owner -- in some scenarios -- to pay less in state income tax on those production earnings than a minimum-wage fast-food worker.\n\nBut Walker has also cut income taxes across every income bracket.\n\nHis second budget, for 2013-\u201915, (while reducing the number of tax brackets from five to four) And later, in 2014, Walker signed legislation that dropped the lowest rate again ( ).\n\nHere are examples are for married couples filing jointly.\n\n*Taxable income levels shown are current. The income levels were slightly lower under the previous law. For example, the first tax bracket was up to $14,000 income, rather than $14,540.\n\nA few points on the table:\n\u2022 The lowest bracket applies to all taxpayers. In other words, all tax filers are subject to the 4 percent tax rate on their first $14,500 of income, then the rates go up as taxable income reaches higher levels.\n\u2022 Reduced tax rates don\u2019t help if your income is so low that you don\u2019t owe any income tax. In that vein, for expanding the state Earned Income Tax Credit, which can result in more taxpayers receiving income tax refunds after their returns are filed.\n\u2022 Burke\u2019s campaign pointed out that couples earning $29,090 got a tax rate reduction from 6.15 percent to 5.84 percent, but couples earning up to $320,250 got a larger reduction, from 6.75 percent to 6.27 percent.\n\nIn addition, the include other breaks for people across many income levels, including those with and those who send their children to .\n\nSo, Walker cut taxes for the wealthy, but for a broad cross-section of taxpayers, as well.\n\nNow to the other part of Burke\u2019s claim -- that Walker raised taxes on 140,000 families.\n\nWalker\u2019s first budget, for 2011-\u201913, contained what the Legislative Fiscal Bureau classified as in tax increases. The largest change was a reduction in the state Earned Income Tax Credit which, as we\u2019ve noted, reduces the amount of income taxes a person owes or enables the person to get a tax refund.\n\nThe fiscal bureau calculated that about would see their credits reduced. In other words, they would pay more in taxes or get a smaller tax refund.\n\nthe maximum credits were reduced for families with two or more children:\n\nAbout three-fourths of the money in the state Earned Income Tax Credit program pays for income tax refunds for those lower-income people, rather than reducing any state income tax they owe.\n\nTamarine Cornelius, an analyst with the Wisconsin Budget Project, which is part of the liberal advocacy group Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, said most of the 140,000 who lost their credits would not save enough from the reduction in income tax rates to make up for that loss. In other words, they\u2019d be paying more in income taxes or be getting a smaller refund. Dale Knapp, research director of the nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, said he believes most of the 140,000 would benefit to some extent from the tax rate cuts, but that he didn\u2019t know whether that savings would offset the lost tax credit.\n\nBurke said Walker cut \"taxes for the wealthiest\" and raised taxes \"on 140,000 Wisconsin families.\"\n\nWalker cut taxes for wealthier residents and raised taxes for people on the lower end of the scale. But he also made tax cuts that applied across the board.\n\nThe statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.\n\nTo comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s web page.", "lang": "en"}
