Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Video of Alia Bhatt arriving at the hospital after Rishi Kapoor\u2019s death. Fact: Video shared as Alia Bhatt arriving at the hospital after Rishi Kapoor\u2019s death is an old one. The video was taken in 2018 at Raj Kapoor\u2019s funeral. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through Google Reverse Image search, a similar video was found in the search results. This video on YouTube has some visuals shown in the initial part of the posted video. The video was uploaded on YouTube in 2018 with the description that it was taken at Krishna Raj Kapoor\u2019s funeral.\n\nSo, when searched with keywords, another video from Krishna Raj Kapoor\u2019s funeral was found which has the same visuals of Alia Bhatt, Karan Johar and Aamir Khan as shown in the posted video.\n\nOther visuals in the posted video can be also found in the newspaper articles related to the Krishna Raj Kapoor\u2019s funeral. Krishna Raj Kapoor died in 2018. So, the visuals are not related to the recent death of Rishi Kapoor\u2019s.\n\nTo sum it up, a video taken in 2018 falsely shared as \u2018Alia Bhatt arriving at the hospital after Rishi Kapoor\u2019s death\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
