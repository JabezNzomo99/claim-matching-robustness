On Facebook, a collage showing masked women pelting stones is being shared in the wake of the Delhi riots. Let\u2019s check whether those images are related to Delhi.\n\n\n\nThe image was found to exist on the internet at least since October 2015. Many of the search results suggested that the image belonged to the Israel- Palestine clashes. Those results can be seen here and here. The exact information about the image wasn\u2019t found from credible sources. But, as it was found to exist on social media prior to the riots in Delhi, the claim is false. \n\n\n\nThe image was found in the photo library of \u2018Reuters\u2019 and it had the following description about the image- \u2018A Palestinian protester uses a slingshot as she takes cover behind a garbage bin during clashes between Palestinian stone-throwers and Israeli troops outside Ofer prison near the West Bank city of Ramallah June 5, 2012. The clashes broke out following a protest marking the anniversary of the 1967 Middle East War\u2019. So, this image is related to the Israel- Palestine clashes.\n\nThe image was found on the website \u2018Thetower.org\u2019 and it had the following description about the image- \u2018Palestinians youths hurl stones at pilgrims at nearby Rachel\u2019s tomb\u2019. Rachel\u2019s tomb is considered holy to Jews, Christians, and Muslims. It is situated in Bethlehem (Palestine).\n\nThe image was found in the photo library of \u2018Getty Images\u2019 and it had the following description about the image- \u2018A Palestinian young woman from the Birzeit University holds stones during clashes with Israeli security forces in Beit El, on the outskirts of the West Bank city of Ramallah, on October 7, 2015. New violence rocked Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank, including a stabbing in annexed east Jerusalem, even as Israel and Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas took steps to ease tensions\u2019. So, this image is also related to the Israel- Palestine clashes.\n\nTo conclude, images from Palestine are being shared in the wake of the Delhi riots.\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
