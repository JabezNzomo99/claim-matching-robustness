People are seen in personal protective equipment administering injections on the animals.\n\nIndia Today Anti-Fake News War room (AFWA) found this to be a misleading claim. The viral video is from last year has no connection to the COVID-19 vaccine. This was an undercover video exposing animal torture inside a German laboratory from 2019. Animal rights activists were outraged after this exposure and demanded immediate closure of the lab.\n\nThe archived version of the posts are saved here and here.\n\nWith the help of the InVid reverse image search, we found several news articles with a similar video and images of animal cruelty published last year.\n\nWebsite of German broadcaster \"DW Urdu\" published a video story on October 20, 2019, with a headline saying \"No animal comes back alive from this laboratory\".\n\nAs per this story, a video made with the help of hidden cameras in a German research laboratory by an animal protection group shows cruelty on animals inside the laboratory.\n\nThe DW video clip shows a small portion of the same video that went viral. Some of the frames are identical.\n\nOn October 18, 2019, website of \"Euro News\" published an article on the same incident with images and video from the same video clip.\n\nAccording to this news report, eight-minute undercover footage, released by animal rights groups SOKO Tierschutz and Cruelty-Free International, exposed the disturbing situation of the animals in a German testing laboratory.\n\nAs per the article, the footage was filmed at the Laboratory for Pharmacology and Toxicology (LPT) in Mienenb\u00fcttel, south-west of Hamburg, by an undercover agent working as an animal keeper assistant.\n\nOutraged by this exposure the animal rights activists demanded immediate closure of the German laboratory.\n\nIt is true that monkeys are being used in animal trials for the COVID-19 vaccine in various laboratories. This has also been reported by the media. But the particular viral video showing animal torture is from last year reportedly from a German laboratory. And this video has no connection to COVID-19 vaccine tests.", "lang": "en"}
