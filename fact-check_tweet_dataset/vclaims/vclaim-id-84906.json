In recent years, he\u2019s started telling a version of the story in which he was urging her not to marry him, and instead run for office in New York or Chicago, and in which she replied that that was a ridiculous idea: She was too aggressive; no one would vote for her. \u201cI don\u2019t think he said that when he actually proposed,\u201d she told me with a smile when I brought up this version of the story. \u201cBut it was kind of a theme that he would go back to.\u201d He wasn\u2019t the only one. The conviction of many of her friends that she should go into politics stemmed, she said, from the fact that \u201cI was really interested in politics and I was really interested in policy and there weren\u2019t that many young women who were. So the fact that I was kind of catalyzed people\u2019s imagining \u2026 \u2018Oh my gosh, you could run for office!\u2019 \u201d But, Clinton said, in those days she saw herself as \u201can advocate, using my legal training, using whatever other skills I had to investigate, research, speak out.\u201d In other words, Clinton pictured herself, as generations of other ambitious women had, as being of service, not as a headliner.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t be, Neil. And the reason I can\u2019t be is that we are a country that is being beaten on every front economically, militarily. There is nothing that we do now to win. We don\u2019t win anymore. Our taxes are too high. I\u2019ve come up with a tax plan that many, many people like very much. It\u2019s going to be a tremendous plan. I think it\u2019ll make our country and our economy very dynamic. But, taxes too high, wages too high, we\u2019re not going to be able to compete against the world. I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is. People have to go out, they have to work really hard and have to get into that upper stratum. But we cannot do this if we are going to compete with the rest of the world. We just can\u2019t do it.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
