On the other hand, the president did make this assertion in a major speech. So let\u2019s see what the data say.\n\nAs of last summer, however, the spending amounted to $500 million, and that was based on tracking \u201cmore than $500 million in advocacy and campaign advertising referencing the health care reforms from the very first spots to air about the prospect of a law in 2009 up through Q2 2013.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you are asking me, have billions of dollars been spent on ads attacking the ACA, the answer is no,\u201d said Elizabeth Wilner, senior vice president of Kantar Media Ad Intelligence with oversight of its Campaign Media Analysis Group (CMAG). \u201cSeveral hundred million dollars, yes. Really an unprecedented sum. But not billions.\u201d\n\nWilner said that Kantar has not updated the numbers since then. But one of the biggest spenders on anti-Obamacare ads, the Koch Brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity, has spent $30 million since July on a relentless assault that has been closely fact checked in this column. But few others come close, so it hard to see how one gets to $1 billion in negative ads, let alone \u201cbillions.\u201d The Kochs may be billionaires, but even they have not yet spent billions attacking the law.\n\nStill, Kantar Media also noted that opponents outspent proponents by a ratio of five to one, so by now the anti-Obamacare ads probably amount to nearly $500 million. So maybe if you were on the receiving end of such a barrage, perhaps it felt like billions.\n\n\u201cThe point made in the speech was that we have been vastly outspent, and that is more than backed up by the facts below, including the Kantar Media report showing we were outspent 5 to 1,\u201d a senior administration official said.\n\nUpdate: Stuart Stevens, a GOP political consultant who was senior strategist for the Mitt Romney campaign, tweeted that it was \u201codd\u201d that The Fact Checker did not mention the fact the the federal and state governments have spent an estimated $700 million promoting the need for health insurance and HealthCare.gov. \u201cThe $700 million is building brand that\u2019s defining product,\u201d he said, comparing it to marketing budgets of major brands. \u201cIt\u2019s a unified campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pitch: If you don\u2019t make much money, the government can pick up some of the cost of your health insurance,\u201d the Associated Press reported. \u201cIf you can afford a policy, by law you have to get one. People will be directed to HealthCare.gov, a government site, for more information.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t an apples-to-apples comparison. The anti-ACA political ad dollars and the ACA-driven product ad dollars aren\u2019t necessarily being spent in the same ways. For starters, a fair amount of insurer dollars go to network advertising, whereas AFP and other political critics have concentrated their firepower on local broadcast. The messaging in all the political ads is sharply negative (\u201clie of the year,\u201d \u201cdisaster,\u201d \u201cjust isn\u2019t working\u201d), whereas the messaging in a typical insurer ad falls somewhere between less negative and neutral (\u201cconfusing,\u201d \u201cconcerned\u201d).\n\nBut we are willing to cut the president some slack here, though that may not please some of our readers. (Others may accuse us of nitpicking.) Opponents of the law have spent significantly more than proponents to discredit the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and the margin is so lopsided that the president might feel justified in inflating the numbers. But next time, Mr. President, stick to \u201chalf a billion\u201d rather than billions \u2014 or focus on the ratio.", "lang": "en"}
