No legitimate news outfit reported the same claim.\n\nIn a video posted April 16 on the PES Facebook page, Filibeck is seen calmly talking about his deportation while on a plane.\n\nAfter newzlater.blogspot.com posted the story, the site was taken down and now leads to a broken link. The video remains available on Youtube page Tokhang TV and has drawn more than 90,000 views.\n\nThe biggest traffic generators were Facebook groups President Rody Duterte Facebook Army, Duterte Ako Hanggang sa Huling Laban, and President Duterte V.P Marcos Worldwide Supporters.\n\nEditor's note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.", "lang": "en"}
