The hashtag #LeftAttackstudents adorned the billboard. Swahney\u2019s Instagram post said that the images were clicked by an Instagram user @hameenasto. \u201cTax-funded propaganda at North Campus, University of Delhi.

Alt News reached outAdamaya Tomar who shot the images. According to Tomar, who is a student at Delhi School of Journalism, the billboard was installed near Delhi School of Economics. \u201cAlong with such billboards, several small posters were put in and around North Campus. According to what I have heard and observed, these posters were installed on January 15. By January 18, all of them were taken down,\u201d said Tomar on a telephonic conversation with Alt News.\n\nHowever, before Mandriya\u2019s images turned-up on a billboard near North Campus, several Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) accounts had circulated the same photographs on Twitter. Since January 5, ABVP handles were posting the images with the same #LeftAttacksJNU hashtag.\n\nABVP Karnataka tweeted four images, including Mandriya\u2019s, and blamed student bodies aligned with the Left for the attack. \u201cIt has been proven once again that violence only describes the left. JNU cannot be the ground for the left goons to go to destruction. This is not an ideological war now. Enough is enough!

Each of the above tweets was made between 9 to 10 pm on January 5. Twitter handle Friends of RSS also tweeted Mandriya\u2019s photo that same day and blamed the attack on the Left.\n\nMandriya posted four images of his injuries on Twitter after his hospital discharge. Speaking with Alt News, he said that the images were clicked by a friend at AIIMS.\n\n\u201cI would like to make it clear I wasn\u2019t attacked by Left goons but ABVP members,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI am not a part of any political group at JNU. However, I was a part of a solidarity march along with JNU Teachers\u2019 Association (JNUTA) against the violence which took place on January 4.\u201d\n\nRegistrations for the winter session at JNU began on January 1 amidst protests against the hike in hostel fees. Multiple media platforms reported violence inside the campus on January 4 after JNU students\u2019 union (JNUSU) allegedly disrupted the registration process.\n\n\n\nAlt News reached out to a current student at JNU (identity concealed at request) who confirmed that there were talks about a solidarity march on January 5 and messages regarding the same were forwarded to students.\n\nMandriya claimed that he was attacked with metal rods by a group of around 10 ABVP members near Periyar Hostel. \u201cI could only identify Jayant Kumar and Vijendra Thakur before losing consciousness,\u201d he said. Mandriya submitted an official statement to the Special Investigation Team (SIT) on January 13. Alt News accessed a copy of the complaint where the alleged attackers\u2019 names have been mentioned. Mandriya shared the pictures of his alleged assaulters. However, Alt News is not uploading them for the sake of privacy.\n\nOn January 18, Newslaundry published an article which also named \u2018Vijendra Thakur\u2019 as a student allegedly involved in the JNU violence.\n\nUsing relevant keywords on Twitter, Alt News found a tweet by Zeba Warsi, special correspondent at CNN News 18, where she uploaded a video interview with Mandriya. The JNU student told Warsi that he is not associated with any political party and showed photographs of his injuries. These were the same images viral on social media. Mandriya also denied that students affiliated with Left parties attacked him. However, the video ended abruptly.\n\nAlt News reached out to Warsi who clarified, \u201cDue to poor network at JNU, I could only upload a part of the video. This interview was a part of News 18\u2018s 3 pm bulletin on January 8.\u201d Warsi shared another video (attached below) which shows the portion not included in her tweet.\n\nIn the video attached above, Mandriya said that around 300 students along with JNUTA planned a hostel-to-hostel peaceful march. \u201cAt Periyar [hostel] there was a Delhi Police PCR and 50-60 staff of Cyclops, private security at JNU. Just behind them, there were ABVP students who were carrying rods and stones. As soon as we reached near them, they started stone-pelting as a result protesters started to flee,\u201d he narrated. Mandriya alleged that he was surrounded by 10 people who attacked him with a rod and with a brick after he fell to the ground. \u201cWhen I managed to get up, the ABVP students attacked again. Finally, two people give me a ride on a two-wheeler and took me to the administrative block where two PCRs were parked but did nothing,\u201d he said, adding that an ambulance at the location took him to AIIMS.\n\nVarious ABVP accounts, therefore, shared JNU student Kamlesh Mandriya\u2019s photographs with the assertion that he was attacked by the Left. His pictures had in fact even found a place on a billboard installed near Delhi\u2019s North Campus. However, Mandriya refutes the claim that he was attacked by the Left and blames ABVP members for his injuries.", "lang": "en"}
