The manifesto claims that this would mean teacher salaries would be \u201camong the most competitive in the graduate labour market\u201d.\n\nWhile it\u2019s difficult to be precise about what counts as a \u201ccompetitive salary\u201d this salary would put teachers in the top quarter of graduate earners.\n\nHow much are new teachers currently paid?\n\nThe minimum salary for qualified school teachers depends on where their school is based.\n\nIn 2019/20 this ranged from \u00a324,373 in England (excluding London and London\u2019s \u201cfringes\u201d) to \u00a330,480 in inner London.\n\nThe government has pledged to increase the starting salary to \u00a330,000 by 2022/23, though this wouldn\u2019t necessarily apply to all teachers.\n\nEducation is a devolved issue, which means that this commitment applies only to teachers in England.\n\nAlso, the Education Secretary stated in a letter to the School Teachers\u2019 Review Body (STRB) that the increase to \u00a330,000 would not apply to teachers in London: \u201cfor London pay areas you will wish to set out recommendations on the appropriate higher starting salaries\u201d.\n\nFinally, academies and free schools (which as of January 2019 made up 32% of primary schools and 75% of secondary schools in England) are not bound by the terms of the School Teachers\u2019 Pay and Conditions Document (STPCD) in the same way that maintained schools are. However, there is evidence that in practice many follow it voluntarily.\n\nWhat is the impact of this commitment?\n\nA salary of \u00a330,000 in 2022/23 is worth \u00a328,300 now (after you adjust for expected inflation\u2014the fact that we expect the purchasing power of the pound to decrease in future years). So the commitment would increase the starting salary of teachers affected, by nearly \u00a34,000 in today\u2019s money.\n\nIs \u00a330,000 by 2022/23 \u201camong the most competitive in the graduate labour market\u201d?\n\nThere is no official definition of a competitive graduate salary. However, the government does publish graduate earnings data, which includes the upper quartile graduate salary one year after graduation.\n\nThe most recent data available is from the tax year 2016/17, where the top quarter of graduates earned at least \u00a325,700 one year after graduation.\n\nThat\u2019s estimated to be worth around \u00a329,200 in 2022/23 which means a \u00a330,000 salary in 2022/23 would probably put teachers in the top quarter of graduate earners and it\u2019s fair to consider this a competitive salary.", "lang": "en"}
