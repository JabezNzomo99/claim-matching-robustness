The claims we\u2019re fact-checking are all drawn from the president\u2019s remarks at a campaign rally in Fayetteville, N.C., on Monday. But he has been repeating the same or similar figures for months. This is a roundup, so we won\u2019t be awarding Pinocchios \u2014 but his claims are certainly misleading.\n\nThis article quoted a report from a Chinese investment bank, China International Capital Corp (CICC), with an estimate of trade war-related job losses in the manufacturing sector of up to 1.9 million between July 2018 and May 2019. When pressed further, Mr Trump's spokesperson said the CICC survey had not included data after May, when there had been a significant increase in tariffs on goods from China. However, no explanation was offered as to where the figure of three million \u2014 or the 2.5 million a week earlier \u2014 had been sourced.\n\n\u201cI know of no reliable evidence that indicates that China has lost 3 million jobs because of the trade war,\u201d Robert Daly, director of the Woodrow Wilson Center\u2019s Kissinger Institute on China and the United States, wrote in an email. \u201cChina had embarked on a historic restructuring of its economy before the trade war began. Before Trump\u2019s election, Beijing had committed to slower, more sustainable growth based on domestic consumption, stronger service industries, and moving up the manufacturing value chain from assembly work to high tech. A reduction in the manufacturing labor force (let\u2019s say it is 3 million jobs) must therefore be measured against job growth in China\u2019s tech and service sectors.\u201d\n\n\u201cChinese exports to the U.S. have begun falling,\u201d Scissors said. \u201cThrough July, they\u2019ve done about $25 billion [less] \u2014 goods and services \u2014 compared to 2018 through July. That is a concrete loss to China. It\u2019s also a reversal of trend, so Chinese losses are larger as compared to what their exports could be without tariffs. But there is no way to get millions of jobs lost \u2014 the export decline is far too small for that given the size of China\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cNonfinancial foreign direct investment (FDI) in China is currently running at an annual rate of almost $140 billion, meaning that thousands of new foreign firms are established in China every month,\u201d Lardy wrote. \u201cSince the tariff war broke out in mid-2018 FDI has expanded about 3 percent annually, roughly the same pace as in the previous five years. And the recent data do not reflect massive new investments in chemical plants. China recently approved wholly foreign-owned investments by both ExxonMobil and BASF, each at a record setting $10 billion. Since ground has not yet been broken, these two projects are not yet included in FDI data.\u201d\n\nIn the last year, U.S. tariffs on imports worldwide produced $63 billion, nearly half of which, or $27 billion, came from Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese imports and other products. (It\u2019s important to note that China has retaliated in part by shunning U.S. agricultural products such as soybeans. Trump said at his North Carolina rally that his administration, as a result, has subsidized U.S. farmers to the tune of $28 billion. \u201cWe\u2019ve given them $28 billion so that they\u2019re whole,\u201d he said.)", "lang": "en"}
