Bernie Sanders look like a gay icon.\n\nA post published Feb. 14 by @indiesauce claims to show the Democratic presidential candidate at the June 1969 Stonewall riots. It depicts a man in a black turtleneck standing alongside four women.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.) It has more than 7,700 likes.\n\nThe Stonewall uprising was a series of confrontations between police and LGBTQ people outside the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York City. It is viewed as the catalyst for the modern gay rights movement and the reason that Pride celebrations are typically held in June.\n\nNo one knows who threw the first brick at Stonewall, but it definitely wasn\u2019t Sanders.\n\nThe Instagram photo does not depict the Vermont senator, nor does it depict the Stonewall riots \u2014 it\u2019s a meme that\u2019s been around since at least 2015. It originally served as a way to make fun of hipsters and Tumblr users.\n\nSanders is no stranger to protests, though; he was arrested in 1963 during a civil rights demonstration in Chicago. He also has a history of advocating for gay rights. But there\u2019s no evidence that Sanders was at the Stonewall riots.\n\nThe Instagram post is inaccurate. We rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
