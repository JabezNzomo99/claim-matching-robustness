In the post, it claims that God has given punishment to China for spreading the deadly virus-like \u2018COVID-19\u2019 to the world. Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nOn reverse image search of screenshots in the video, we found similar visuals in a video posted by a user named \u2018William Castronuovo\u2019 on YouTube. In the description of the video, it is mentioned as the visuals of tsunami waves surging into the Ishinomaki city of Japan. When we searched for the official sources using these keywords, we found the same video in \u2018FNN311\u2019 Youtube channel. \u2018FNN311\u2019 is the official YouTube channel of Japan News Network \u2018FUJI\u2019. This channel was specially dedicated for posting the videos related to the \u2018Great East Japan Earthquake\u2019 of 2011. It is mentioned in the video that because of the powerful earthquake off the northeastern coast of Japan on \u201811 March 2011\u2019, large tsunami waves surged into the Ishinomaki city of Miyagi district, Japan. It is also mentioned that this video was shot by an employer of \u2018Ishinomaki gas Corporation Limited\u2019 while the large tsunami waves suddenly surged into the city. He shot this video from the rooftop of his company which is located near the Ishinomaki fishing port.\n\nWhen we searched further for other credible sources on Google, we found the same visuals in a video posted by the Ukraine based \u20181+1 TV \u2019 channel on YouTube. It is mentioned in the video that visuals are related to the tsunami waves in Japan. Similar visuals of the damage caused by the Tsunami can be watched here.\n\nThe same video was earlier falsely shared as that representing the floods in Kerala, and more recently as the devastation caused by the collapse of a hydropower dam in Laos. Japan was struck by a powerful earthquake on 11 March 2011, and was followed by a Tsunami killing thousands of people. Further details about this disaster can be read here.\n\nTo sum it up, 2011 video of tsunami devastation in japan is falsely portrayed as the floods in China.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
