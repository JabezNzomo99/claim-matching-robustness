The USA wants no more threats!\"\n\nTrump later doubled down, telling reporters aboard Air Force One, \"They\u2019re allowed to kill our people. They\u2019re allowed to torture and maim our people. They\u2019re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we\u2019re not allowed to touch their cultural site? It doesn\u2019t work that way.\"\n\nIran has 24 sites on UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage List, and an additional 56 proposed sites that could be eligible in the future. Iran is home to the Shia religious centers of Mashhad and Qom; a landmark 5th Century B.C. hydraulic system; a variety of seminal landscaped gardens; and Persepolis, the onetime capital of the Persian Empire.\n\n\"At three times the area of France, Iran is vast, and its cultural history dates back millennia,\" said Stephennie Mulder, associate professor of Islamic Art at the University of Texas-Austin.\n\nCritics quickly warned that a deliberate attack on cultural sites could mean that Trump and other officials are committing war crimes.\n\nThe critics have a good argument, but enforcement would hardly be a certainty. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nThe legal framework for protecting cultural sites is extensive.\n\n\"The purposeful targeting of cultural sites is prohibited and is punishable under international law according to multiple statutes,\" Mulder said.\n\nThe United States is a party to two significant international agreements that explicitly outlaw attacks on cultural sites: the Geneva Convention of 1949 and the Hague Convention of 1954.\n\nThe Geneva Convention for the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, Article 53 (1949), said that members \"shall refrain from any act directed by way of reprisals against cultural property.\"\n\nFurther, Article 147 would make such destruction \u2014 if extensive, wantonly undertaken and not militarily necessary \u2014 a \"grave breach\" of the Geneva Convention. This is important because a \"grave breach\" of the convention would make the offense a war crime, said Anthony Clark Arend, a professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University and a specialist in international law.\n\n\"If the president intentionally targeted Iranian cultural sites in circumstances where there was no specific military necessity, he would be committing a war crime,\" Arend said.\n\nIn addition, Article 4 of the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of an Armed Conflict, says the parties must \"respect cultural property\" and to protect it from \"destruction or damage.\" The only exception is for \"military necessity.\"\n\nMeanwhile, an earlier agreement that the United States is a party to says that in sieges and bombardments, \"all necessary steps must be taken\" to spare historical monuments and buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, as long as they are not being used for military purposes.\n\nIn 2017, a few months after Trump took office, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed a resolution that condemns the unlawful destruction of cultural heritage sites. It came in the wake of several high-profile incidents that drew international condemnation: -- the Taliban\u2019s destruction of the monumental Buddha statues of Bamiyan, ISIS\u2019 destruction of the ancient city of Nimrud in Iraq, and the demolition of Palmyra and other sites in Syria.\n\nSimilar language is included in Geneva Convention Protocol 1, article 53 and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The United States has signed these agreements, but they are not binding. The United States has not ratified them.\n\nPerhaps most important, however, is an attack on cultural sites would violate U.S. law, not just international law.\n\nMulder said that any attack on a culture site would be a \"clear infringement\" of the U.S. War Crimes Act, which reads, \"Whoever, whether inside or outside the United States, commits a war crime ... shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for life or any term of years, or both, and if death results to the victim, shall also be subject to the penalty of death.\"\n\nAnd the Defense Department\u2019s Law of War Manual makes clear that cultural property is to be protected. (The document mentions the phrase \"cultural property\" more than 600 times.)\n\nThe manual says that Defense Department personnel, \"should act as if they were legally bound by the rules for the protection of cultural property in the 1954 Hague Cultural Property Convention during hostilities, even when conducting operations in the territory of a state that is not a party\" to the convention.\n\nHow stringently have violations been prosecuted?\n\nEnforcement of these rules has run hot and cold over the years.\n\nEnforcement efforts languished after a flurry of prosecutions after World War II. Then, after the warfare in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, individuals were convicted and sentenced to prison by an international criminal tribunal for destroying cultural property, said Patty Gerstenblith, director of the DePaul University College of Law\u2019s Center for Art, Museum and Cultural Heritage Law.\n\nCultural property advocates applauded the 2018 International Criminal Court conviction of a jihadist in Mali for destroying shrines and a mosque in Timbuktu.", "lang": "en"}
