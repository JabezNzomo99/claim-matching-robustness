(People who get insurance from their employer \u2014 which is about half of Americans under 65 \u2014 already participate in a group that spreads the risk.)\n\nUnder the ACA, states can waive certain provisions of the law but there were three key \u201cguardrails\u201d that must be met: The states still must provide insurance to a comparable number of residents, ensure that the coverage is at least as comprehensive as the essential benefits package and pledge that the waiver programs meet out-of-pocket spending requirements. The idea was that coverage would be similar in all 50 states. (See this Congressional Research Service report on what provisions can be waived under ACA.)\n\nThe problem, according to health-care experts, is that there is no definition in the bill of \u201cadequate and affordable coverage,\u201d so whether a state complied with the law would be subject to the whim of the health and human services secretary at the time. Moreover, unlike in the ACA, states would not have to prove that they maintain \u201cadequate and affordable coverage\u201d before receiving a waiver.\n\nThe House bill would have allowed insurance companies for one year to consider a person\u2019s health status when writing policies in the individual market, if that person had a lapse in coverage for more than two months. It even set aside billions of dollars to help pay for insurance for people who find themselves unable to pay their bills when they are stuck in that one-year period between the gap in coverage and getting back to the community rating. Even so, the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s report on the House bill \u2014 issued after the bill was approved \u2014 made for grim reading.\n\nThe CBO said states that take advantage of the waiver provisions could perversely end up blowing up their insurance markets, leaving people with preexisting conditions with spiraling costs. About one-sixth of the U.S. population was estimated to live in states that would face this problem. \u201cLess healthy individuals (including those with preexisting or newly acquired medical conditions) would be unable to purchase comprehensive coverage with premiums close to those under current law and might not be able to purchase coverage at all,\u201d the CBO said.\n\nKimmel got it mostly right, but he spoke with too much certainty. It really depends on what individual states do. Some states, especially blue ones, would probably keep a lot of ACA protections. But others might not. The Cassidy-Graham plan offers a route that would all but ensure that premiums are much higher for people with preexisting conditions, if they can receive coverage for their condition in the first place.
