We found the picture of the White House on the stock photo website Alamy. The original picture from 2014 is titled \u2018White House in Washington at night\u2019.\n\nOn comparing both the pictures, it became evident that the original picture was edited to make it darker and few lights were blacked out.\n\nThis proves that the picture was in fact taken before Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nOn the other end, several reports emerged stating that President Trump was briefly taken to the underground bunker on May 29, 2020. Read the reports here and here.\n\nAlso, according to an explanatory article by The Indian Express, President Trump was not the first president who was taken to the underground bunker.\n\n\u201cPresident Bush also used the PEOC (Presidential Emergency Operations Center) to meet with senior administration officials after the terror attack. First Lady Laura Bush was also escorted to the bunker\u201d an excerpt from the article read.\n\nHence, from the above information, we can conclude that the post in question is misleading and partly false.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
