No, that's not true, that story was made up by a site that routinely publishes fake stories in order to earn money through advertising.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Huzlers on May 3, 2018 titled \"Kanye West Announces He Wants To Be A Slave; Will Hold 'Slave Master' Auditions Soon\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nOS ANGELES - It seems as though Kanye West cannot stay away from criticism, with thousands of fans showing their disapproval for his decision to support Donald Trump and recent political tweets, with the latest being him saying 400 years of slavery was a choice by slaves. Kanye West has even gone as far enough as saying slavery must've not been that bad at all for slaves to \"choose\" to remain enslaved. And to go even further, Kanye has also announced that he plans to be a \"slave\" for a whole 3 months to prove his point. Kanye has also announced that he plans to hold auditions in Los Angeles soon to ensure that he hires the \"perfect slave master\".\n\nThe story follows after West made some controversial comments about slavery during a TMZ interview:\n\nBut Huzlers styles itself as a \"fauxtire\" website and carries a disclaimer at the bottom of each page:\n\nAccording to Splinter News the site is run by Pablo Reyes and David Martinez and according to Buzzfeed Reyes is involved with several other fake news websites. They tend to shy away from political stories, opting instead to write for a more \"urban\" audience, with stories about rappers, criminals and celebrities.\n\nWe wrote about huzlers.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Florida Man Did NOT Stab Friend For Saying PUBG Is Better Than Fortnite\n\u2022 Fake News: Kanye West Did NOT Say He's Not Black In Recently Deleted Tweet\n\u2022 Fake News: New Research Did NOT Show Cardi B Fans Have a 90% Higher Chance Of Acquiring An STD\n\u2022 Fake News: Cardi B Did NOT Say Bruno Mars Might Be The Baby Daddy\n\u2022 Fake News: Lil Tay NOT Rushed to Hospital, NOT Beat By Group of Children At Playground", "lang": "en"}
