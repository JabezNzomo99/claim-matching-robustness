A Little Caesars spokesperson confirmed that the promotion is a scam.\n\nThe viral Facebook post, purportedly from the Little Caesars Facebook page, shares a promotion offering coupons for pizza to everyone that shares and comments on it by 8 p.m. on Aug. 10. (RELATED: Does Canada Charge A 270% Tariff On US Dairy?)\n\n\u201cCelebrating our 61st Birthday \u2013 Everyone who shares and also comments by 8 PM Monday \u2013 Can Get 3 Large Pizza,\u201d reads the post. \u201cWe Will Inbox Your Coupon \u2013 After visit https://u2coupon.com/LittIe-Caesars/ to validate your entry.\u201d\n\nHowever, the post and the link are a scam. The provided link leads users to a website with a photo of a Little Caesars restaurant and a button to \u201cvalidate entry\u201d to the promotion. Users are then taken to another website that appears to be unaffiliated with Little Caesars and that asks users to provide an email address after answering several questions.\n\nThe Facebook page that shared the post was created on Aug. 9. It does not have the same handle as the official Little Caesars page, and it also lacks the blue check mark that indicates it has been verified by Facebook. Searching Little Caesars\u2019 website and its official Facebook page turned up no such promotion.\n\n\u201cThis is not a valid Little Caesars promotion, it is spam,\u201d Jill Proctor, communications manager for Little Caesars, told Check Your Fact in an email.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Little Caesars has been the target of a bogus promotion. Since 2016, the pizza chain has on Facebook debunked several similar scams offering coupons for free pizza.\n\n\u201cThere is currently a fraudulent Little Caesars coupon in circulation, stating \u2018Little Caesars is rewarding everyone with 3 free large pizza coupon on their 60th anniversary,'\u201d the Little Caesars Facebook page wrote in February 2019. \u201cThis coupon was not generated or distributed by Little Caesars.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
