The law does not contain any provisions allowing victims of bullying to demand financial compensation.\n\nA widely shared Facebook post claims that the Republic Act 10627 -- anti-bullying legislation that became law in 2013 -- gives people the right to seek financial compensation from anyone who calls them fat.\n\nHere is a screenshot of the post, which was shared by a Facebook account that parodies the Philippines\u2019 local broadcast organization ABS-CBN.\n\nThe text on the photo, when translated to English, says: \u201cOpen a bank account\u2026 you will definitely get rich from this!\u201d\n\nThe post\u2019s caption says: \u201cWhen someone calls you fat, you have the right to file a case against them or ask them to pay you P15,000 - RA10627\u201d\n\n15,000 Philippine pesos is the equivalent of around $280 USD.\n\nThe RA 10627 legislation was signed by then-President Benigno Aquino III on September 12, 2013 to address cases of bullying in elementary and secondary schools.\n\nNeither the text of the law nor its implementing rules and regulations contain any provisions allowing victims of bullying to claim financial compensation.\n\nAccording to one of the law\u2019s authors, Senator Juan Edgardo Angara, the law does not contain any such provisions.\n\n\u201cThis is indeed a fake news. RA 10627 or the Anti-Bullying Law DOES NOT allow people to demand P15,000 payment or file a case against those who call them fat or overweight,\u201d Shielo Mendoza, Angara\u2019s media relations officer, said.\n\nShe said that the law\u2019s definition of bullying could include name-calling.\n\nBut according to the law, the penalties for bullies range from written warnings to expulsion from school and are adjudicated by head teachers. There is no mention of financial compensation for victims.\n\nAn official from the Department of Education, the agency tasked with implementing the law, also said the law did not enable victims of bullying to seek financial compensation.\n\n\u201cUnder Republic Act 10627, there\u2019s no provision there stating that the offending parties or the guilty party may be required to pay civil damages for violation of said act or those who failed to comply with the said law,\u201d Tonisito Umali, undersecretary for legislative liaison office, external partnerships service and school sports told AFP.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing there, what\u2019s only stated there are administrative sanctions against school administrators, suspension of permit to operate for schools that failed to comply\u201d.\n\nThe misleading Facebook post has been shared nearly 60,000 times.", "lang": "en"}
