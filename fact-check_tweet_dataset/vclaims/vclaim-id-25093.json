No, that's not true: the rumor was started by a Belgian satire website mocking the French government. It is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by NordPresse on January 4, 2019 titled \"Netflix annonce une adaptation fran\u00e7aise de Suicide Squad\" (archived here) which simply contained this image:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail so people who understood a litte bit of French but didn't follow French politics might have gotten confused:\n\nBut the picture actually shows several ministers currently in the French government. One can recognize Prime Minister \u00c9douard Philippe, Nicole Belloubet (Justice), Muriel P\u00e9nicaud (Labour) or Florence Parly (Armed Forces) among others. It is unclear when, where or by who the picture was taken.\n\nLe Journal Du Nord (nordpresse.be) is a satirical website that was set up to mock the (real) sudpresse.be (since renamed sudinfo.be), a Belgian media group. They were involved in a lawsuit with each other in 2017 which was eventually won by NordPresse. It is run by Vincent Flibustier who also offers media training about fake news on his website, he clearly knows what he is talking about.\n\nThey have sort of a disclaimer in their header that reads:\n\nTranslated: \"all information verified by our monkey analysts\".\n\nWe wrote about nordpresse.be before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Ch\u00c3\u00a9rif Chekatt NOT Killed So He Could Not Reveal He Was Acting on Government Orders\n\u2022 Fake News: French Interior Minister Did NOT Announce Plan To Release Calm Jihadists to Make Room for Yellow Vests in Prisons\n\u2022 Fake News: BFMTV Did NOT Report Wearing Yellow Vests is Now Banned Until Further Notice\n\u2022 Fake News: Televison NOT Reporting 23 Dead, 300 Severely Wounded at 'Gilets Jaunes' Demonstration in Paris\n\u2022 Fake News: No 12 (or 123) Dead At 'Gilets Jaunes' Protests in France", "lang": "en"}
