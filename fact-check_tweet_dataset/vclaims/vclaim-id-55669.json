Made from T-shirts or bandanas, these face coverings are an at-home alternative to surgical masks or N-95 respirators, which the CDC recommended only for healthcare workers on the front lines of the pandemic.\n\nThe recommendation \u2014 which the CDC posted in a statement on its website alongside a 45-second video of U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams demonstrating how to make one of the cloth masks \u2014 spurred a wave of do-it-yourself guides online.\n\nBut this raised a new dilemma among crafty Americans making their own masks: How should people clean the masks in order to safely reuse them? Making a new face guard for each trip outside could prove tedious.\n\nCue the advice of Facebook: \u201cThose that use a fabric mask \u2013 after wearing place in ziplock bag and microwave 2-3 minutes to sanitize. Do this after each wear,\u201d says a post that users have shared more than 7,200 times. Another post with similar advice has about five times that amount of shares.\n\nAccording to an April 9 instructional guide by the CDC, people who go outside wearing fabric or cloth masks should clean them regularly, the frequency of which depends on how often the face coverings are used. When asked by Snopes if microwaving cloth masks will sanitize them, a CDC spokesperson responded via email with a bulleted list of what cloth face coverings should do, including \u201cfit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face\u201d and \u201cbe able to be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to shape.\u201d The latter bullet point was highlighted yellow in the email.\n\nIn other words, the CDC has not explicitly forbidden the public from microwaving the face coverings nor weighed in on the effectiveness of the method. But it has made this recommendation, including in its April 9 guide: \u201cA washing machine should suffice in properly washing a face covering.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Greeneville/Greene County Office of Emergency Management and Homeland Security on Facebook warned against microwaving face masks, writing on Facebook:\n\nThere are a couple of problems with this:\n\n 1. The microwave will set flame and/or burn certain materials.\n\n 2. If your mask has metal in it, refer to issue number 1, as well as, possibly killing your microwave. Please do NOT microwave your hand made masks. Washing in warm water and Antibacterial Soap and a small amount of bleach will disinfect your masks of any germs. Yes this includes COVID-19.\n\n\u201cDO NOT place any face mask in the microwave for any amount of time,\u201d the Colorado River Fire Rescue department also said on Facebook. \u201cThere is no evidence that microwaving a face mask will sanitize it properly.\u201d\n\nProof of people\u2019s failed attempts at the microwave idea are available via social media, too. People have shared stories of kitchen fires starting in their microwave and photos of charred fabric masks. \u201cI tried it,\u201d one Facebook user wrote. \u201cPlease don\u2019t try it. It smells awful.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
