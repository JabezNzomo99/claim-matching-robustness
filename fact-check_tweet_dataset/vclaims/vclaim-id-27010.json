We checked.\n\nAfrica Check contacted the minister\u2019s office for the source of her data. They directed us to the department of home affairs and the Zimbabwean embassy.\n\nSo far, neither body has responded to our questions. (\n\nThe claim that \u201cmillions of Zimbabweans\u201d live in South Africa\n\n. And \u201cmillions\u201d means at least 2 million.\n\nBut checking the claim is difficult, said Prof Tom Moultrie. \u201cT\n\nhere is a real shortage of hard data on how many Zimbabweans are in the country.\u201d\n\nMoultrie is the director of the\n\n. His research has focused on demography and the analysis of census and survey data.\n\n\u201cThe population of Zimbabwe is only about 12 or 13 million people,\u201d he said. So 2 million people leaving the country would be significant.\n\n\u201cIf there are \u2018millions\u2019 of Zimbabweans [in South Africa], then that means one-sixth of the population that was in Zimbabwe is now in South Africa.\u201d\n\n(StatsSA), publishes estimates on the number of people in the country who were born elsewhere.\n\nThe 2011 census estimated there were\n\nliving in South Africa. Of these,\n\nThe 2016 community survey\u2019s estimate of migrants was much lower, at\n\nfor Africa Check in which he said Stats SA now estimates there are \u201capproximately 4 million foreign-born people in South Africa\u201d.\n\nBut the agency hasn\u2019t released a breakdown of the countries these migrants are from.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that the population census enumerates all people within the borders of South Africa, irrespective of their citizenship or migratory status,\u201d Maluleke\n\n\u201cIt is not the mandate of Stats SA to determine whether people born outside South Africa are documented or not.\u201d\n\nAfrica Check has analysed previous claims that Stats SA undercounts the\n\nin South Africa and even the\n\nitself. Neither claim could be substantiated.\n\n, the South African research chair in mobility and the politics of difference,\n\nAfrica Check he had \u201cnever seen any justification for a particular, higher figure\u201d. Landau is also the former director of the\n\nStats SA may not count some undocumented migrants in their surveys, but the vast majority of migrants\n\n, according to Landau. In a census, undocumented migrants might avoid census enumerators during the actual count, but would still be accounted for in the\n\nreleases annual estimates of international migrants by age, sex and origin.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa presents a very difficult case for estimating the total stock of international migrants,\u201d the division\u2019s Pablo Lattes told Africa Check.\n\nThe latest estimate, for 2017, put South Africa\u2019s total migrant population at just over 4 million. The number of Zimbabweans was estimated at 649,385.\n\nLattes added that there was \u201csignificant\u201d uncertainty about the origin of migrants in South Africa.\n\nConclusion: No data backs claim, but still uncertainty on origin of migrants in South Africa\n\nA national minister said \u201cmillions of Zimbabweans\u201d were \u201cliving in South Africa\u201d. She called on them to help resolve the crisis in their home country.\n\n\u201cMillions\u201d means at least 2 million. Zimbabwe\u2019s population is only 12 to 13 million, an expert said, so the claim would mean at least one-sixth of the country\u2019s people were now living in South Africa.\n\nData from Statistics South Africa doesn\u2019t support Zulu\u2019s claim. Migrants from Zimbabwe were estimated at 672,308 in the 2011 census, and at 574,047 in the 2016 community survey.\n\nBut what if Stats SA undercounts the number of migrants? One expert said he had \u201cnever seen any justification for a particular, higher figure\u201d. Some migrants may not be counted, but the vast majority would.\n\nThe UN population division estimates there were 649,385 migrants from Zimbabwe in South Africa in 2017.\n\nBut a UN expert said South Africa was a \u201cvery difficult case\u201d when it came to estimating migrant numbers, and there was \u201csignificant\u201d uncertainty about the origin of migrants living in the country.\n\nWe therefore rate the claim as unproven.", "lang": "en"}
