Beto O\u2019Rourke held a town hall at the Navasota Veterans of Foreign Wars post on Aug. 25. O\u2019Rourke is looking to unseat one-term incumbent and 2016 presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz in the 2018 midterm election.\n\nThe Navasota Examiner article about the rally quoted the VFW post commander Carl Dry about a request he says he received while the O\u2019Rourke campaign was setting up for the event.\n\n\"They wanted to open the doors (to the Flight Deck Lounge), and I couldn\u2019t allow that, and they wanted to take the flags down. I didn\u2019t only say no, I said hell no, you don\u2019t take the flags off the wall,\" Dry is quoted saying in the newspaper. \"I can\u2019t believe any American would ask us to do that, and I don\u2019t know why he wanted them down or what he was going to put up instead.\"\n\nWebsites such as TopStoriesUSA.com picked up Dry\u2019s quote in early September, saying that the O\u2019Rourke campaign had made the flag removal request and that the request showed a theme of the campaign\u2019s \"aversion to the American flag\" and patriotic symbols.\n\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its newsfeed.

We have hosted dozens of town halls in VFW posts across the state, and always ensure that the flags are prominently and respectfully displayed.\"\n\nDry told us two people, about 10 minutes apart, asked him to remove the American and Texas flags before the event. He said they were not wearing name tags or other identifiers related to the O\u2019Rourke campaign.\n\nDry said he assumed the two individuals were part of the campaign because they came to him from the room where the event was being held and returned to it after he told the first \"no,\" and the second \"hell, no.\"\n\n\"I had to assume they were Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign people,\" Dry said. \"Whether they were or not, I don\u2019t know. I did not ask.\"\n\nThe TopStoriesUSA.com story also speculates that \"there seems to be an aversion to the American flag and symbols of patriotism\" with O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign and that the event \"was attracting some that might have been offended to see the American and Texas flags on display behind O\u2019Rourke.\"\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign is not distancing itself from the American flag. The most prominent image on the campaign website\u2019s homepage is a photo of O\u2019Rourke, with the American flag behind him. He performed at a July 4 concert this year with Willie Nelson in front of the flag. There are also numerous photos and videos on social media of him speaking in front of the American and Texas flags from other events this summer.\n\nIt\u2019s not unreasonable to assume, as Dry did, that the people who asked to \"take down\" the American flags at the Aug. 25 rally were from the O\u2019Rourke campaign. But it is an assumption, and furthermore it\u2019s not clear why they were asking: It\u2019s possible they wanted to move them to another location or feature them in some other way. We can say that the campaign definitely does not show an \"aversion\" to the flag or to patriotic symbols, as it has used them in many other settings. We rate this claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
