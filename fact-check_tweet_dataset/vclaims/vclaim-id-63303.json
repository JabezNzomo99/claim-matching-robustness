The video then cut to a scene of a news reporter wearing a face mask, then to a scene of a truck dumping the corpses in a mass grave.\n\nThroughout the video, a reporter\u2019s voice was heard. \u201cThough unsubstantiated by state and the authorities, we now have information from a knowledgeable source that the city\u2019s temporary morgues are filled beyond capacity. Mass graves have been dug for the incineration and burial of the dead. The current death toll due to the riptide virus is now in thousands.\u201d\n\nClaim Check, Facebook\u2019s monitoring tool, flagged at least 19 Facebook pages and accounts that posted the video and said in the captions that it was the situation in Italy right now. The earliest post was shared on March 26.\n\nThe miniseries is about the outbreak of the \u201criptide virus,\" a fictional virus that is an offshoot of the bird flu. The news reporter in the video clip mentioned the name of the virus, not COVID-19.\n\nItaly has a soaring number of COVID-19 fatalities, but there are no reports of using mass graves yet as of writing. Many of Italy\u2019s COVID-19 casualties are being buried alone because funeral gatherings are not allowed anymore.\n\nA news report from CBS News on March 27 said that priests are permitted to say a prayer at burials and only close family members can attend, but in most cases, even close family members are not allowed to be near the dead at all, especially if the casualty\u2019s 15-day isolation period is not yet over.\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
