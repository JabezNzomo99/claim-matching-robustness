S-protein 120 is found in only one other virus known to man, HIV.\u201d\n\nIt then claims \u201cthe current strain of Covid-19 is indeed genetically modified by inserting these HIV proteins into the Coronavirus and therefore making it a weapon\u201d.\n\nIt ends with a claim that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, \u201cwas the first person to identify, isolate and isolate PATENT\u2019s (sic) spike-glycoprotein S-120\u201d and a link to a series of patents.\n\nAnother post makes the same claims. The two posts have been shared over 700 times, viewed over 30,000 times and attracted over 90 comments between them.\n\nThe May 20 Facebook post claims the SARS-CoV-2 virus has a \u201c120 point\u201d spike glycoprotein, or \u201cS-Protein\u201d that is found only in one other virus, HIV.\n\nSpike glycoproteins are proteins on the outside of a virus particle that bind the virus to a cell \u2013 in a human, animal or whatever the host is \u2013 that can be infected.\n\nUniversity of New South Wales (UNSW) molecular microbiology researcher, Professor Peter White, told AAP FactCheck that the spike glycoprotein in SARS-CoV-2 does not have \u201c120 points\u201d.\n\nProfessor White\u2019s UNSW colleague, PhD researcher Emma Harding, said the spike glycoprotein found in SARS-CoV-2 is not found in HIV.\n\nThe May 20 Facebook post carries a link to a series of patents filed in the past by the current director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Dr Anthony Fauci, claiming they are \u201ca nail in a coffin and that Dr Fauci \u201cwas the first person to \u201cidentify, isolate and isolate[sic] PATENT\u2019s spike-glycoprotein S-120\u201d.\n\nHowever there is no patent for a \u201cspike-glycoprotein S-120\u201d. Dr Fauci is a leading researcher on HIV and other immune system-related infectious diseases. The patents linked to include HIV treatments he worked on that target GP120, the glycoprotein the HIV virus uses to attack white blood cells.\n\nGP120 was discovered by Harvard researchers in the 1980s. The protein derives its name from the protein\u2019s molecular weight of 120 kilodaltons (kDa), the federal Department of Health told AAP FactCheck in an email.\n\nThe \u201cS-120\u201d used in the post seems to take the \u201c120\u201d from the GP120 found in HIV.\n\nUNSW researcher Ms Harding, said GP120 and the S-glycoprotein in SARS-CoV-2 \u201care entirely different proteins\u201d.\n\n\u201cGP120 and SARS-CoV-2 S protein connect to two entirely different cell receptors and lead to both viruses being able to enter very different types of cells,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Facebook post also claims \u201cthe current strain of Covid-19 is indeed genetically modified by inserting these HIV proteins into the Coronavirus and therefore making it a weapon\u201d.\n\nClaims that COVID-19 contains \u201cinserted\u201d HIV characteristics have been debunked in the past. The claims were tied to a now-withdrawn study posted to a non-peer-reviewed pre-publish website.\n\nThe May 20 Facebook post goes on to claim SARS-CoV-2 is \u201cgenetically modified\u201d and therefore a \u201cweapon\u201d. However, scientists have found that SARS-CoV-2 could not be a lab construct and the says the virus is not genetically modified or man-made.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claims in the post to be false. Microbiology experts say the spike glycoprotein in SARS-CoV-2 does not have \u201c120 spikes\u201d and is not found in the HIV virus. HIV and SARS-CoV-2 use entirely different proteins. Dr Anthony Fauci did not patent a \u201cspike-glycoprotein S-120\u201d and the post misrepresents the patents it links to as they relate only to an HIV glycoprotein called GP120. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
