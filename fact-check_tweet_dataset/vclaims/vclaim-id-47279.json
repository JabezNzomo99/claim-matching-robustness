The founder, Markus Alexji Persson, known as \u201cNotch,\u201d says that he feels like 11 years was enough for the game\u2019s period and it should say it\u2019s farewells and leave the stores when the end of 2020 hits, according to his interview.\n\nThe article didn\u2019t get much attention at the time, but it started to circulate again on social media in the days before the new year. To make matters worse, this article was momentarily a leading result on Google when people started to search for information about Minecraft\u2019s supposed demise:\n\nMinecraft is not shutting down.
