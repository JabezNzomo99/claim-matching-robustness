Then-President Barack Obama declared a public health emergency the same month.\n\nA viral Facebook post claims that Trump criticized the Obama administration\u2019s handling of the pandemic, allegedly tweeting, \u201cObama\u2019s handling of this whole pandemic has been terrible! As President, ALL responsibility becomes yours during a crisis like this, whether or not you\u2019re entirely to blame. John McCain, and for that matter myself, would never let thousands of Americans die from a pandemic while in office.\u201d\n\nThe claim comes amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic that has so far killed over 58,000 people in the U.S., according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. The alleged tweet is a fake, however.\n\nA search of Trump\u2019s verified Twitter accounts \u2013 @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS \u2013 turned up no matches. Nor did the Daily Caller News Foundation find the comment in the Trump Twitter Archive, a database of Trump\u2019s tweets dating back to May 2009.\n\nThe 289 characters in the alleged tweeted far exceed the 140-character limit Twitter had until 2017, further adding to the post\u2019s dubiousness.
