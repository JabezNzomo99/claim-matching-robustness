Kamala Harris posing for a photo with her parents.\n\nThe picture shows Harris posing with retired Silicon Valley executive Suneil Parulekar and his wife Rohini at a fundraising gala.\n\nThis Facebook post uses the photograph to question the Democratic presidential hopeful\u2019s racial background. \u201cKamala Harris claims shes [sic] black,\u201d reads the caption. \u201cTake a look at her parents and make up your own mind!\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019 parents, Shyamala Gopalan and Donald Harris, both immigrated to the U.S. from other countries.

Neither of them are pictured in the meme, as its caption claims.\n\nIndia-West, an Indian news outlet based in America, included the meme\u2019s picture in an article about Harris getting elected to the Senate in 2016. Its caption revealed the identities of the couple and event captured by the photograph.\n\nThe image comes from a 2016 fundraising gala thrown by Pratham USA, an Indian charitable organization. Suneil Parulekar and his wife Rohini, board members for Pratham\u2019s Bay Area chapter, took a picture with Harris at the event, where she delivered the keynote speech.\n\nHere\u2019s the picture from the Pratham USA Facebook page:\n\nThe fundraising gala happened in August 2016, so it is impossible for Harris\u2019 mother to have attended the event. She died seven years earlier in 2009.", "lang": "en"}
