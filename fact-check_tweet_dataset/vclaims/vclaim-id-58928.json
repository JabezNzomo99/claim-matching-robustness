Microwave sickness has been added to the dictionary. So when the telecom industry insists that RF microwave radiation emitted by cell phones and 5G antennas is safe \u2013 just know one thing \u2013 they\u2019re lying to you.\u201d Below the text is a screenshot showing a \u201cMedical Definition\u201d of the term and a link to an article titled, \u201cMerriam Webster Adds \u2018Microwave Sickness\u2019 to the Dictionary\u201d by 5GCRISIS.COM.\n\nThe July 9 post by 5G Free Hamilton Kirikiriroa was first posted by Americans for Responsible Technology on July 4 and has received more than 330 shares.\n\nThe rollout of the 5G network in New Zealand has raised many health concerns by opponents of the mobile wireless technology. The Facebook post by NZ page 5G Free Hamilton Kirikiriroa features a July 3 blog post to highlight a definition of \u2018microwave sickness\u2019.\n\nThe 5G Crisis \u2013 \u2018A Project of Americans for Responsible Technology\u2019 blog post reads, \u201cMicrowave sickness has now been formally added to the Merriam Webster dictionary,\u201d and links to the noun \u2018microwave sickness\u2019 in the Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary.\n\nTo examine whether \u2018microwave sickness\u2019 was recently added to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, AAP FactCheck conducted an internet archive search of the entry\u2019s web address and found it dated back to at least 2009.\n\nMerriam-Webster editor-at-large and lexicgrapher Peter Sokolowski told AAP FactCheck in an email that \u2018microwave sickness\u2019 was included in the first printing of the Medical Dictionary in 1986.\n\nMr Sokolowski explained that Merriam-Webster dictionaries were not open-source publications.\n\n\u201cMerriam-Webster is the oldest and best-selling reference publisher in the United States,\u201d he AAP FactCheck. \u201cOur books are professionally edited and researched, going back to Noah Webster\u2019s first dictionary in 1806.\u201d\n\nRegarding Merriam Webster\u2019s lexicography, he referred AAP FactCheck to the article \u201cHow does a word get into a Merriam-Webster dictionary?\u201d on its website.\n\n\u201cTo decide which words to include in the dictionary and to determine what they mean, Merriam-Webster editors study the language as it\u2019s used,\u201d the article says. \u201cThey carefully monitor which words people use most often and how they use them.\u201d\n\nThe article also goes on to detail how a word progresses from a citation to a dictionary entry. \u201cTo be included in a Merriam-Webster dictionary, a word must be used in a substantial number of citations that come from a wide range of publications over a considerable period of time. Specifically, the word must have enough citations to allow accurate judgments about its establishment, currency, and meaning.\u201d\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claims in the Facebook post to be false. The term \u201cmicrowave sickness\u201d has not recently been added in the Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary. Merriam-Webster lexiographer Peter Sokolowski told AAP FactCheck it was first included in 1986. False \u2013 The primary claims of the content are factually inaccurate or misleading. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
