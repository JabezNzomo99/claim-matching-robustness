The site and its operator Alex Jones are known for peddling conspiracy theories.\n\nThe story said a 2001 UN strategy document \"outlines the need to flood America and Europe with hundreds of millions of migrants in order to maintain population levels.\"\n\nThere is a UN report on replacement migration, and Infowars lays out scenarios listed in the report. But Infowars deviates from the truth by claiming this has been the UN\u2019s \"agenda for decades.\" The report explicitly said the scenarios in its study \"are not meant to be recommendations in any way, but illustrations of hypothetical scenarios.\"\n\nThe title of the report \u2014 \"Replacement Migration: Is It a Solution to Declining and Ageing Populations?\" \u2014 even questions, not asserts, whether replacement migration is a solution.\n\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe UN report said the organization\u2019s population division monitors fertility, mortality and migration trends for all countries of the world, as a basis for its official population estimates and projections. Due to two prominent trends \u2014 population decline and population aging \u2014 it conducted a study to address whether replacement migration is a solution to those issues.\n\nReplacement migration is defined as \"the international migration that would be needed to offset declines in the size of population and declines in the population of working age, as well as to offset the overall ageing of a population.\"\n\nIt analyzed six replacement migration scenarios for eight low-fertility countries, including the United States, and for two regions, Europe and the European Union. It also offered \"additional considerations\" besides the scenarios.\n\nInfowars\u2019 post includes a scenario outlined in the report for the United States that said that to keep a certain \"potential support ratio\" it \"would be necessary to have 593 million immigrants from 1995 to 2050, an average of 10.8 million per year.\"\n\nPress releases in six different languages accompanied the UN report, countering Infowars\u2019 headline claiming that a \"plan\" had been \"revealed\" just recently.\n\nInfowars did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe UN document at the center of the Infowars post explores \"replacement migration\" but explicitly stops short of recommendation, much less implementation. The UN has no authority to compel anyone to immigrate. Further, the document that was \"revealed\" is nearly two decades old.", "lang": "en"}
