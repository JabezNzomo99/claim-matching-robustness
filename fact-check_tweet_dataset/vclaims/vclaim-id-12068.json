A Muslim exorcist is performing some ritual to expel \"Hindu jinn\" supposedly from a \"possessed Muslim woman\".\n\nTwitter user Tyagraj Shekhawat posted this video tagging Aajtak on Saturday. He wrote in Hindi \"Iss Bangladeshi Hindu Mahila ke dharmantakaran kay yeh video Sylhet ka bataya ja raha hai, jaha saare Hindu parivaaro ka safaya kar diya gaya, auraton ko chhorkar...\" (It is being said this video of religious conversion of this Bangladeshi Hindu woman is from Sylhet, where Hindu families have been cleansed barring few women).\n\nAt the time of writing, this story more than 3,000 people have shared and over 2,500 people have liked this post on Twitter. This same post has been shared by many on Facebook believing the claim to be true.\n\nThis 2.20-minute long video is disturbing. A woman is seen held by a man from behind and being tortured and threatened by another man with a knife. Some other burqa-clad women are also present in the room. The entire conversation is in Bengali.\n\nAt one point the man asks the woman to repeat something in Arabic. Then in Bengali, she is forced to say, \"I am now converted to Islam from Hinduism\".\n\nWe found one user @haivri also shared this post on Twitter on January 25. In the comment section, some Twitterati raised doubt if it was the video of conversion.\n\nOne Twitter user @moinaksg commented that this seemed to be an exorcism-related video and claimed, \"The woman is Muslim and supposedly attacked by a Hindu jinn\". He mentioned a YouTube link which has a longer version of the incident with the viral claim.\n\nWe searched in Bengali with the combination of keywords \"Hindu Jinn exorcism\" and found quite a few videos related to it.\n\nBangladeshi YouTube channel EM Multimedia also posted the longer version of the video on January 19, 2019, with a Bengali caption, \"This is the best video of exorcism. See how a Hindu Jinn is converted to Islam\".\n\nAnother YouTube channel RH Bangla TV also posted this video with a caption In the name of exorcism, village women are sexually exploited.\n\nIn the video, it can be heard that the woman calls the man, Huzoor, which in local parlance in Bangladesh is referred to an exorcist. The Exorcist is seen shoving a knife into a bucket of sand and the woman cries in pain saying, \"Huzoor I will leave this place forever, even the earth\" in Bengali.\n\nAccording to our local correspondent Shahidul Khokan in Bangladesh, this typical Bangla accent in the video is widely spoken in the Chittagong area of South-Eastern Bangladesh.\n\nWe found this practice of exorcism, particularly, the supposed expulsion of \"jinn\" of other religion is prevalent in almost all religions including Muslims in this subcontinent.\n\nOther videos showing exorcism to evict Hindu Jinn can also be seen being practiced in Pakistan.\n\nUpdate -Twitter user Tyagraj Shekhawat has now deleted his original post after the India Today Fact Check story. He has now posted a new tweet with an apology.\n\nAlso read| Fact Check: The news behind Indian woman soldier dying in Kashmir is fake\n\nAlso read| Fact Check: No, Pakistan is not visible from Mehrangarh Fort in Jodhpur", "lang": "en"}
