But there was some expectation that the SOFA could be renewed after that, with at least a small U.S. force remaining. But there are unanswered questions about whether approval of SOFA, which would have allowed some U.S. troops to remain in Iraq, could have been reached with the Iraqi government\u2014and how hard the Obama administration fought for it.\n\nClinton, who cited Krueger to warn against hiking the minimum wage as high as $15, is absolutely right\u2014and it is a bit amazing that O\u2019Malley seems to not know who Alan Kreuger is, even though the Princeton University professor has written reports on the minimum wage that have been highly influential among Democrats. Kreuger\u2019s research was considered groundbreaking because he documented that \u2014contrary to standard economic dogma\u2014that an increase in the minimum wage may not necessarily lead to job losses. (This assertion is still sharply disputed by conservative economists.) His biography shows he has no connection to Wall Street\u2014just years in academia.", "lang": "en"}
