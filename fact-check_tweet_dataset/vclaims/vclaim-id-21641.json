The headline from a website with the URL conservative-headlines.com said, \"South African firm ordered to lay off 3,389 white employees.\"\n\n\"A South African utility company has been given an ultimatum to reduce its number of white employees by 44.3 percent over the next five years,\" the article said. \"This means 3,389 whites have to go. It is part of the Federal \u2018Black Empowerment\u2019 program.\"\n\nThe headline misses the mark on its main points, but behind it lie real events.\n\nPolitiFact Global News Service examined the origins of this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as \"not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts - and fact-checking - in politics, journalism, and everyday life.\"\n\nThe conservative-headlines.com website, which features images of the Confederate flag and an op-ed in favor of a white \"ethnostate\" in South Africa, took its story from a prominent Afrikaans language news site Netwerk 24.\n\nNetwerk 24 was reporting on the affirmative action plans of Eskom, South Africa\u2019s public electric company. South Africa operates under the Employment Equity Act, which says \"employers must make sure designated groups (black people, women and people with disabilities) have equal opportunities in the workplace.\"\n\nNetwerk 24 reported the 3,389 figure based, it said, on documents Eskom had submitted to three unions. One of the unions, Solidarity, describes itself has having \"a close relationship with the Afrikaner community.\" Solidarity opposes \"reverse racism,\" and regularly tangles with the government over affirmative action.\n\nThe factual part of the claim is this: In November 2014, the South African Labor Department sent Eskom a report telling it to set numerical targets so that the makeup of its workforce would more closely match that of the country at large. The company had to submit a plan to reach those targets by 2020.\n\nThe report itself doesn\u2019t give a number. But if Eskom didn\u2019t come up with a plan and implement it, then the Labor Department could bring a case against it in the government\u2019s Labor Court and seek to impose a fine.\n\nWe asked the Solidarity union where it got the figure of 3,389 whites and spokesman Francois Redelinghuys told us \"this number was derived from the employment equity plan Eskom submitted whereby it was envisioned that by 2020 they aim to reduce the amount of white workers as part of their affirmative action strategy.\"\n\nRedelinghuys didn\u2019t tell us how the number was derived.\n\nEskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe told us, meanwhile, that \"there is no such plan\" to layoff white workers.\n\nIn Eskom\u2019s 2016 annual report, the company lays out the workforce makeup it hopes to achieve by 2021. For example, the fraction of black employees in senior management is slated to rise from about 61 percent to 89 percent.\n\nIt would seem likely that blacks would gain at the expense of whites, but there is no way to translate those changes into absolute numbers. Adding to the complicated picture, the company plans to downsize across the board by about 20 percent.\n\nHow this all would shake out racially is unclear. In May 2015, Solidarity said in a press release that in the coming year, Eskom planned to cut 1,689 blacks from its rolls, and 1,080 whites. In other words, blacks would be the bigger losers.\n\nThe company distanced itself from those figures, saying they had been part of a draft plan than was never adopted. But in any event, the numbers don\u2019t bolster the broader claim that whites will suffer more than blacks.\n\nIf the numbers in the headline are dicey, so is the idea that the government had \"ordered\" Eskom to lay off white workers.\n\nSolidarity spokesman Redelinghuys told us that \"we only said that said amount (of) white worker jobs would be reduced. The media made the article about laying off workers.\"\n\nProfessor of labor law Christoph Garbers at Stellenbosch University told us that \"the (government\u2019s) report/ recommendation clearly does not say what the article says.\"\n\nGarbers said the Labor Department told Eskom to take demographics into account, but \"that is a far cry from interpreting this to mean that Eskom now has to dismiss people.\"\n\nGarbers also said that by law and precedent \"you can\u2019t justify dismissal on the basis of affirmative action.\"\n\nEskom\u2019s spokesman told us that to date, not a single worker has been \"retrenched,\" or as we would say in American English, laid off.\n\nA Facebook post said that the South African government ordered a company to lay off over 3,000 white workers. The source of the figure remains unclear. While the government did tell the state utility company Eskom to increase the fraction of black workers in various job categories, it did not specify a number. And while the government could take Eskom to court if it failed to adopt a higher goal, it did not order the firm to fire anyone. On that point, even the union most closely identified with white workers agreed.\n\nFurthermore, even if that many whites did lose their jobs, the figure alone says nothing about whether more blacks might lose theirs. Eskom plans to downsize and in one plan leaked from the company, that\u2019s exactly what could have taken place.\n\nLastly, South African law bars a company from laying off a worker in order to meet affirmative action goals, an expert told us.", "lang": "en"}
