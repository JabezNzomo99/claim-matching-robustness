The Pope does not mention Duterte at all in this message.", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "Jun 27, 2018 4:57 PM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-4314", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/hoax-pope-francis-calling-duterte-blessing-good-leader", "vclaim": "The blog realspotnews.info in their June 26 post ran the headline, \u201cPope Francis: \u2018He is the Most Popular Leader, he did the Right Thing on your Country and a Blessing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe facts: No news report supports the claim and there had been no such statement coming from Pope Francis or the Vatican. The embedded video is a reupload of CNN Philippines\u2019 April 2 newscast which reported on the separate messages of Duterte to Filipinos and Pope Francis to victims of conflict. The two leaders did not mention each other in that instance.\n\nDuterte, who has verbally lambasted the Catholic church, told Filipinos in his April 1 holiday message to \u201cpray for the welfare and safety of our countrymen and for lasting peace in our nation so that we can all work together in harmony towards real change.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Roman Catholic Pontiff, in his Easter Sunday mass homily on the same date called for peace in the Middle East and other regions in conflict. \u201c[...] [D]ialogue and mutual respect may prevail over division and violence,\u201d said Pope Francis.\n\nAnother blog also claims that the Pope called Duterte a \u201cgood leader\u201d and priests \u201cshould not enter politics.\u201d The embedded video is uploaded by \u201cJust Stellar TV\u201d which has a following of 38,000. The video is entitled \u201cPope Francis responds to Duterte\u2019s Apology\u201d and is a textual narration of an April 4, 2016 ABS-CBN News report of the same title.\n\nBe wary of fake news regarding timely topics. This post may have been written in connection to President Rodrigo Duterte's tirades against the Catholic Church in the Philippines, where 3 priests have been killed since December 2017.\n\nNo company profile, editorial board, and contact details are presented in both blogs. Both blogs also included a disclaimer dismissing responsibility over \u201cprecision, currency, or completeness\u201d of its contents, a trait that is often used by various \u201cfake news\u201d blogs. \u2014 Miguel Imperial/Rappler.com\n\nIf you suspect a Facebook page, group, account, a website, or an article is spreading false information, let Rappler know by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
