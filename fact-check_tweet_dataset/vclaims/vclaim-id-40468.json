Four other Facebook pages and groups also posted the claim, with a combined 800 shares, 2,556 reactions, and 540 comments. The President Rody Duterte-Federal Movement International page can potentially amplify the post, having over one million members.\n\nIt is also wrong to say that job regularization was removed because of the EDSA Revolution.
