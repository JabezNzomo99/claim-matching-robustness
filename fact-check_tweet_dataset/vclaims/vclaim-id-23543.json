They are conducting a peaceful road-show according to the instructions of their \u2018honest and clean\u2019 leader Amit Shah.\u201d\n\nThe post can be viewed below, and its archived version here.\n\nWhile the clashes between the Bharatiya Janata Party and Trinamool Congress workers broke out in the evening in College Street, when Shah's convoy was passing through the area, BOOM observed that the images were taken in broad daylight. This was a first giveaway.\n\nWe then ran a reverse image search on both the images and found that both were old and unrelated.\n\nThe first image, where two men can be seen destroying the windshield of a truck is originally from Jamshedpur. The image is seven years old and part of countrywide protests which broke out because of rising petrol prices. The image was shot by news agency PTI.\n\nThe second image, has placards and posters of politicians who are not from Bengal. The text written on the image states, \u201cSetu Gomati Tat,\u201d along with the photo of Dinesh Sharma, the deputy Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nBOOM then ran a keyword search with violence in Uttar Pradesh and was redirected to news reports that documented protests by BJP workers because of rising prices in 2010.", "lang": "en"}
