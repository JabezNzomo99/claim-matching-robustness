No, of course not, that's totally not true. The story was uploaded to a prank website by some joker and was copied later by a well known fake news website. It also got posted to three pro-Trump groups on Facebook before being deleted by moderators. None of it is real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on React365 on August 15, 2018 titled \"Salem Oregon to Implement Sharia Law\" (archived here) which read in full:\n\nFake news site \"Huzlers\" also posted a copy of the hoax later.\n\nChuck Bennett is indeed the mayor of Salem, Oregon at the time of writing, but that is about the only real bit of information in the entire story. No other reliable news website has made any mention about Sharia law being implemented in Salem, Oregon and the site that published the story is a prank website where users can submit their own headline, description and photo to create realistic looking prank news articles.\n\nUsers don't even need to upload their own image, there is a built-in search function that will pull an appropriate image from Google image search.\n\nThe site is part of a larger network of prank sites all using the same basic layout but sometimes in different languages. It appears to be run by a Belgian company named Mediavibes or Media Vibes which is managed by a man named Nicolas Gouriou according to registration records.\n\nEach site in the network comes with a disclaimer (sometimes translated into a different language) that reads:\n\nSo don't fall for this prank now that we've warned you about it!\n\nWe wrote about react365.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Williamsburg, Kentucky NOT Voted Methamphetamine Capitol Of The State\n\u2022 Fake News: Two Great White Sharks NOT Found Swimming In Laurel Lake Near London, Kentucky\n\u2022 Fake News: Louisville, Kentucky NOT Having Emergency Outbreak Of Deadly Virus\n\u2022 Fake News: Girl Did NOT Commit Suicide After Being Bullied on Social Media\n\u2022 Fake News: Mount Pleasant Woman Did NOT Fake Pregnancy and Newborns Death", "lang": "en"}
