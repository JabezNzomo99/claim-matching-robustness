There is also no official report of Chiu\u2019s death as of May 18.", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "May 18, 2020 8:42 PM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-43135", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/kim-chiu-found-dead-tacloban-home", "vclaim": "The webpages contained a video of what looked like a news report from GMA News. When clicked, the video stops playing after 3 seconds. A prompt then appears asking the viewers to share the link on their own social media accounts to \u201cuncover\u201d the rest of the video.\n\nThe facts: There is no official report of Chiu\u2019s death as of May 18. Cnnupdates.ml is not CNN Philippines\u2019 official website. Both the official channels of CNN Philippines and GMA News have not published reports about it as well.\n\nThe video embedded in the webpages also did not contain information about Chiu. It was a clip taken from GMA News\u2019 24 Oras report in December 2019, which was altered to place over Chiu\u2019s photo. Rappler found the original video, which was about journalist Cesar Apolinario\u2019s death.\n\nThe edited video was posted by YouTube channel News Reports. All its uploaded videos last under a minute and are similar to the faked report on Chiu.\n\nRecently, Chiu has been criticized online over something she said during an online gathering of ABS-CBN stars. (READ: 'Love Thy Woman' cast defends Kim Chiu over viral 'classroom' quote)\n\nOn May 15, a Philippine Star report quoted Chiu's sister as saying that the actress is doing fine despite being bashed on social media. Chiu's sister added that the actress is not lonely because she is surrounded by her family during this time.\n\nChiu is known to have been staying in Metro Manila during the lockdown. She distributed relief goods to barangays and hospitals in Metro Manila on April 18 to celebrate her birthday. Domestic flights have been suspended during the lockdown.\n\nThis is not the first time Rappler debunked a claim from cnnupdates.ml. In March, the website falsely claimed that fake cigarettes that \u201cspread coronavirus\u201d have reached the Philippines. It used the same tactic then where it asked readers to share the link on their accounts before fully playing the embedded videos. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
