The claim stems from a satirical Facebook post.\n\nThe Facebook post further alleges that the purported move by the Amazon founder made President Donald Trump \u201cfurious.\u201d The text is accompanied by a photo of Bezos appearing to smile. (RELATED: Did Kamala Harris Call Joe Biden \u2018Trash\u2019?)\n\nIn reality, Bezos hasn\u2019t offered to ship mail-in ballots for free, through Amazon Prime or otherwise. No mention of such an offer appears on any of his social media pages, on the website of his venture capital firm Bezos Expeditions or in Amazon\u2019s press releases.\n\nAndy Borowitz, the author of The New Yorker\u2019s satirical column The Borowitz Report, seems to be the source of the claim. He posted the satirical remark on his Facebook page on Aug. 10, and the image being shared appears to be a screen grab of it. Borowitz frequently posts farcical statements on his Facebook page.\n\nThe claim started circulating amid concerns that the Trump administration\u2019s opposition to additional funding for the U.S. Postal Service and operational changes to it will make mail-in voting more difficult during the November election.
