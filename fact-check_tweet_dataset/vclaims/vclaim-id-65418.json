A key problem faced by watchdog bodies, according to the Liberals and other critics, was the inability to follow information beyond one agency.\n\nRalph Goodale, the public safety minister, outlined the purpose of the committee in an opinion in the National Post, emphasizing that MPs and senators sitting on the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians will have \u201cextraordinary access to classified information.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnlike existing national security review bodies, it will not be siloed to one agency,\u201d Goodale said. \u201cThe committee will be able to examine any department or agency responsible for any aspect of national security or intelligence, going wherever the evidence takes them.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a big claim, to say members of the committee can go \u201cwherever the evidence takes them.\u201d\n\nThat implies few to no limits.\n\nWhat are the limits to information access?\n\nThe proposed law establishing the committee lists exceptions to its access to information.\n\nAmong the seven exceptions listed are Cabinet confidences, information related to ongoing military operations, information related to ongoing law enforcement investigations, and witness and source identities.\n\nIn addition, the law would allow a minister of any department under question by the committee to refuse to provide information. A refusal is allowed if the minister determines two things: that the committee\u2019s request involves \u201cspecial operational information\u201d and that providing it would be \u201cinjurious to national security.\u201d The former term is broadly defined in the Security of Information Act. It includes information that would reveal, \u201cwhether a place, person, agency, group, body or entity was, is or is intended to be the object of a covert investigation, or a covert collection of information or intelligence, by the Government of Canada.\u201d\n\nKent Roach, a national security law expert at the University of Toronto, said, \u201cwhat the minister says is correct subject to any claims of secrecy\u201d allowed by the law.\n\nWith that caveat, however, Goodale\u2019s statement is technically incorrect. As written, the law does not open the door to all information.\n\nWhat are the limits to agency access?\n\nGoodale\u2019s statement could be interpreted to mean that the committee can go \u201cwherever the evidence takes them\u201d among departments and agencies, instead of being restricted to just one.\n\nA spokesperson for Goodale\u2019s office told FactsCan the minister was making a point about overcoming silos.\n\nInterpreted this way, the statement is true.\n\n\u201c[The committee] will have access to information that is under the control of any department or agency and related to the committee\u2019s mandate,\u201d said Scott Bardsley, Goodale\u2019s press secretary. \u201cFor instance, if while examining an issue with the CSIS, the committee discovered a strong link to RCMP, it could follow that lead.\u201d\n\nRoach confirmed the committee has a \u201cwhole of government mandate.\u201d This is unlike other watch dog bodies, such as the Security Intelligence Review Committee, which are limited to reviewing one agency and cannot follow a trail beyond that agency.\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between what Goodale said, and what he meant to say.\n\nOn what he meant to say: It\u2019s true that the new body, the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, can track evidence across different departments and agencies.\n\nOn what he actually said: It\u2019s false that the MPs and senators overseeing national security activities can go \u201cwherever the evidence takes them.\u201d There are limits on the type of information the committee can access.\n\nBecause it\u2019s easy to confuse the two interpretations, we score Goodale\u2019s statement misleading.\n\nSee how we score.", "lang": "en"}
