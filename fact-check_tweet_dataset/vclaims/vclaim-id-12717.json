An earlier version was also posted by Facebook page \u201cShowbiz Government\u201d on March 23, 2013, also citing a March 2013 Tempo article which also cites Locsin\u2019s supposed confession. Both articles have been deleted from these sites, but copies still remain in Wayback Machine, a web archive service.\n\nLocsin himself said in a 2016 post on Twitter that it was slain Constabulary colonel Rolando Abadilla who authorized the training of the Moro recruits in a special operation called Oplan Merdeka, and that the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos was \u201cstunned\u201d that his \u201cinfiltration force\u201d was \u201cmassacred.\u201d\n\nWhat became known as the Jabidah Massacre is the killing of Moro recruits by members of the Philippine armed forces on March 18, 1968, on Corregidor Island. The number of those killed is disputed until now. They were trainees of the Philippine military who were supposed to infiltrate Sabah, an island state in Malaysia that the Philippines is also claiming, upon the orders of Marcos.\n\nFollowing Arula\u2019s testimony, then senator Benigno \u201cNinoy\u201d Aquino Jr. delivered a privilege speech on the issue on March 28, 1968. \u201cThere have been some killings, yes. But these are killings that come under the heading of murder. And, for this, the guilty must be hauled before our justice and made to account and to pay,\u201d said Aquino.", "lang": "en"}
