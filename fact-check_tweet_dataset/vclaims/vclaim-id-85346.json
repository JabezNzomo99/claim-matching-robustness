It is often difficult to separate out the impact of trade agreements on jobs, compared with other, broader economic trends. But the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service in 2015 concluded that the \u201cnet overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP,\u201d though it noted that \u201cthere were worker and firm adjustment costs as the three countries adjusted to more open trade and investment among their economies.\u201d\n\nAn appendix to the State Department report, for instance, says that 634 people would be employed in the \u201carts, entertainment and recreation services\u201d in the United States as a result of Keystone \u2014 and only 138 of those jobs would be in the construction states. No dancer in New York City is going to get a job because of Keystone, but just as the part-time work of the construction workers adds up to jobs expressed in annual terms, the economic model assumes some of that spending reverberates through the economy and eventually lands in the pockets of people across the country, thus contributing to a portion of their annual wage.", "lang": "en"}
