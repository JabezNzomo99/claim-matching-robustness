The version of the bill that was passed in May omitted this provision, meaning some veterans may no longer have access to subsidized private insurance.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, premium tax credits help make health insurance more affordable. In general, this premium is not available for people who otherwise are eligible to enroll in other \u201cminimum essential coverage,\u201d like government-sponsored health care. (For veterans, that would include VA health care.)\n\nSo the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department came up with a regulation to make an exemption, allowing veterans and their dependents to choose whether to get VA coverage or enroll in coverage through the Obamacare exchange. They can choose to be on the exchange, and receive premium tax credits for it, even if they are eligible for VA care. As our friends at PolitiFact noted, the number of uninsured veterans declined significantly after Obamacare took effect.\n\nThe Republican replacement bill initially contained this provision. But it was removed in the version that ultimately passed the House, in order to help its chances of moving through the Senate using a parliamentary procedure that would require no Democratic votes.\n\nProponents of the bill say that nothing will change for veterans. The legislation \u201cmakes no changes to veterans\u2019 health care. Unless they are specifically enrolled in and receiving insurance through the VA, they are eligible for our tax credit,\u201d House Ways and Means Committee spokeswoman Lauren Aronson said.\n\nBut Pelosi\u2019s staff says it\u2019s not so definitive. The replacement bill strikes language in current law that applies to the veteran tax credit with no mandate to reissue the existing IRS regulation, so that means the Treasury Department and IRS need to come up with new regulations to add the protection for veterans, they said.\n\nLisa Zarlenga, attorney at Steptoe & Johnson who was the tax legislative counsel for the Treasury Department when Obamacare went into effect, agreed that a new regulation would need to be issued for the new health law. But she added that the agencies could ultimately decide to use the same language in the current regulation that exists under Obamacare.\n\nBecause the provision wasn\u2019t included in the bill itself, the House Ways and Means Committee is now trying to get the current IRS regulation to become law. A key Republican on the committee, Rep. Sam Johnson (R-Tex.), introduced a separate bill to add a \u201cbelts and suspenders\u201d level of protection for premium tax credits for veterans.\n\nBut that 7 million figure also includes people who have other forms of health insurance (for example, Medicaid or through their employer) and therefore are already not eligible to receive a premium tax credit \u2014 regardless of whether they\u2019re eligible for VA health care.\n\nThe exact number is not readily available. We checked with several veterans\u2019 groups and the VA, but there was no specific figure. One reason is that VA health care eligibility is constantly being adjusted, said Dan Caldwell, director of policy for the conservative Concerned Veterans for America: \u201cIt is likely that a large portion of that 7 million veteran population have employer-provided insurance or other coverage which would exclude them from getting a tax credit regardless of whether they are eligible for VA health care.\u201d\n\nPelosi states in broad, certain terms that 7 million veterans will lose premium tax credits for themselves and their dependents under the Republican plan to overhaul Obamacare. But in reality, it\u2019s not so certain. Republicans have stressed that they want current protections to remain, even if Obamacare is repealed; it\u2019s an issue only because of the parliamentary tactics they have chosen. They\u2019re now taking steps to turn the current IRS protections into law.\n\nAnd even if current regulations don\u2019t carry over, the universe of people affected by this change likely is not the full 7 million. There already are people within that 7 million population who don\u2019t qualify for the tax credit because they have another form of insurance.", "lang": "en"}
