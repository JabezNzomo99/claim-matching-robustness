Bernie Sanders in a CNN interview ahead of the South Carolina primary, accusing the Vermont senator of saying \"loopy stuff\" about orgasms and cervical cancer, children\u2019s nudity and women\u2019s rape fantasies.\n\nYes, you read that right. Not your typical morning on CNN.\n\n\"Bernie has all of this loopy stuff in his background, saying things like women get cancer from having too many orgasms, or toddlers should run around naked and touch each others' genitals to insulate themselves from porn,\" O\u2019Brien told CNN \"New Day\" anchor Alisyn Camerota.\n\n\"Why has this stuff not been more surfaced?\" O\u2019Brien said. \"He's written about women's rape fantasies. That hasn\u2019t been surfaced. That\u2019s the loony side of Bernie.\"\n\nO\u2019Brien\u2019s claim caught our attention and generated a number of headlines, so we decided to check it out.\n\nGalia Slayen, a spokesperson for former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg\u2019s campaign, said O\u2019Brien \"misspoke\" with regard to the claim about cancer and orgasms.\n\n\"He meant that Sanders believes it was a lack of orgasms that leads to cancer,\" she said.\n\nNow that that\u2019s cleared up, here\u2019s what we found: The Bloomberg adviser was drawing from essays Sanders contributed to a left-leaning alternative newspaper about 50 years ago. Not everything O\u2019Brien said needs a correction.\n\nBackground on Sanders\u2019 writings for the Vermont Freeman\n\nBloomberg\u2019s campaign cited 2015 articles in the New York Times and Mother Jones that examined Sanders\u2019 writings for the Vermont Freeman in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Sanders wrote roughly a dozen pieces when he was in his late 20s and early 30s, before his political career took off.\n\nThe writings became a source of controversy for Sanders during his presidential campaign in 2016. We fact-checked a claim related to his essay on women\u2019s fantasies of rape. At the time, Sanders campaign spokesman told CNN the 1972 essay was a \"dumb attempt at dark satire in an alternative publication\" that \"in no way reflects his views or record on women.\"\n\nSanders downplayed the writings as \"bad fiction\" and told late-night host Seth Meyers that he \"learned my lesson.\"\n\nHe said the \"poorly written\" article mentioning rape was meant to confront \"gender stereotypes of the period,\" according to the New York Times. (The Sanders campaign pointed us to his remarks during the 2016 campaign when we asked about his writings.)\n\nBelow, we\u2019ll compare what Sanders wrote with O\u2019Brien\u2019s descriptions on CNN.\n\nO\u2019Brien\u2019s description: \"Women get cancer from having too many orgasms.\"\n\nSanders\u2019 1969 article: Sanders\u2019 point in an essay titled \"Cancer, Disease and Society\" was that lack of sex \u2014 rather than too much sex \u2014 could lead to poor health or, specifically, cancer.\n\n\"In another article in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine ... it is stated that \u2018sexual adjustment seemed to be very poor in those with cancer of the cervix (who) were found to have a lower incidence of orgasm during sexual intercourse,\u2019\" Sanders wrote, quoting a 1954 study.\n\n\"The manner in which you bring up your daughter with regard to sexual attitudes may very well determine whether or not she will develop breast cancer, among other things,\" he wrote.\n\nThroughout the essay, Sanders quoted freely from various studies and from a book by Austrian psychologist Wilhelm Reich, who believed in connections not only between sexual energy and good health but also between sexual repression and fascism.\n\nFor the record, the American Cancer Society has said \"there\u2019s no reason to believe that emotions can cause cancer or help it grow.\"\n\nO\u2019Brien\u2019s description: \"Toddlers should run around naked and touch each others' genitals to insulate themselves from porn.\"\n\nSanders\u2019 1969 article: \"In Vermont, at a state beach, a mother is reprimanded by Authority for allowing her 6-month-old daughter to go about without her diapers on. Now, if children go around naked, they are liable to see each others sexual organs, and maybe even touch them. Terrible thing! If we (raise) children up like this it will probably ruin the whole pornography business, not to mention the large segment of the general economy which makes its money by playing on peoples sexual frustrations.\"\n\nSanders writings often criticized cultural oppression, according to Mother Jones. In one piece, Sanders wrote that a function of schools was to \"set up in children patterns of docility and conformity.\"\n\nIn the essay in question, which was titled \"The Revolution is Life Versus Death,\" Sanders wrote about the monotony of life, his frustrations with the status quo, and a nonviolent revolution that he believed was on the horizon in the United States.\n\n\"The revolution comes when two strangers smile at each other, when a father refuses to send his child to school because schools destroy children, when a commune is started and people begin to trust each other, when a young man refuses to go to war, and when a girl pushes aside all that her mother has \u2018taught\u2019 her and accepts her boyfriend\u2019s love,\" he said.\n\nSanders\u2019 1972 article: \"A man goes home and masturbates his typical fantasy. A woman on her knees. A woman tied up. A woman abused. A woman enjoys intercourse with her man \u2014 as she fantasizes being raped by three men simultaneously \u2026 Do you know why the newspapers with the articles like \u2018Girl, 12, raped by 14 men\u2019 sell so well? To what in us are they appealing?\u2019\u2019\n\nThe column, \"Man and Woman,\" was about changing gender stereotypes and roles. Later in the essay, Sanders suggested men and women should reconsider how they relate to each other.\n\nO\u2019Brien said Sanders has said \"things like women get cancer from having too many orgasms, or toddlers should run around naked and touch each others' genitals to insulate themselves from porn \u2026 He's written about women's rape fantasies.\"\n\nO\u2019Brien got the first detail backwards. Nearly five decades ago, Sanders wrote about the possibility that women could get cancer from having too few orgasms, not too many.\n\nSanders also wrote about a revolutionary order in which toddlers would not be chastised for public nudity, noting that such a world could have negative consequences for the porn industry.\n\nFinally, Sanders wrote about women\u2019s rape fantasies in an essay on gender stereotypes.", "lang": "en"}
