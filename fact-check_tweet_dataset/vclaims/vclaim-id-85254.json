The number of adult victims were reportedly at 1,05,536.\n\nThe same year was also marked by a series of lynchings across the country, fuelled by child kidnapping rumours on WhatsApp.\n\n\n\nAmong the states, Maharashtra tops the list with 10,623 reported cases, while Uttar Pradesh follows closely behind at 8,721 cases. Both the states have recorded the highest number of child victims of kidnapping over the last two years.\n\n\n\n2018 saw a sharp rise in the number of victims from the previous year, with an 11% jump. It is considerably higher than the 4% growth in the number of victims between 2016 and 2017.\n\nIn the first six months of 2018, more than 20 people were lynched to death by mobs across the country, on suspicions of being child lifters. These suspicions were fuelled by a massive misinformation campaign on WhatsApp, sending people on a frenzy in paranoia that their children will be kidnapped.\n\nIt didn't help that these obscure messages would be accompanied by graphic videos and images of violence, causing people to react aggressively with fatal consequences.\n\nAlso Read Dhule Lynching Takes Death Toll Due To Fake News To 23: 5 Things To Know\n\nIn November, BOOM spoke to IPS Harsh Poddar and IPS Rema Rajeshwari - two top cops from Maharashtra and Telangana, respectively - who gave us a first hand account of how they averted fatalities from mob attacks inspired by such rumours.
