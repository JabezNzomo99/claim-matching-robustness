At that time \u2014 months before the election \u2014 the FBI opened an investigation into links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.\n\nThat investigation eventually landed in Mueller\u2019s hands in May 2017, about a week after Trump fired FBI director James Comey.\n\n\"The crooked journalists, the totally dishonest TV pundits ... their ratings dropped through the floor last night. Our friends (at Fox News), Tucker, Sean, Laura, through the roof.\"\n\nYes, MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow took a hit and Fox News shows got a bump after Barr\u2019s report.\n\nThe Associated Press reported Nielsen ratings showing Maddow\u2019s audience on Monday, March 25, was down 19 percent from her average, and it slipped a little further on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity saw his audience shoot up 32 percent Monday. Generally, Fox News shows beat their average performance, as their CNN and MSNBC counterparts \"plunged,\" as the Associated Press put it.\n\n\"We've created since my election 5.5 million new jobs. Nobody would have believed that was possible, including 600,000, brand new \u2014 remember, this couldn't happen, you'd need a magic wand \u2014 brand new manufacturing jobs.\"\n\nTrump is close on the number of total new jobs since November 2016, which is 5.38 million. But he exaggerated the gains in manufacturing \u2014 the increase over that span was 493,000.\n\nIn any case, he didn\u2019t take office until January 2017, which means that both numbers are padded by a couple of months. In addition, economists always say that presidents are just one factor in the health of an economy.\n\nIt\u2019s a stretch to assert that \"nobody believed that was possible.\" Bureau of Labor statistics show monthly job gains during Trump\u2019s tenure (shown in red in the chart below) are pretty similar to the scale of the job gains under President Barack Obama (in blue) between 2010 and 2016.\n\n\"More manufacturing jobs, in fact, were created in 2018 than any year in 21 years, that\u2019s not bad.\"\n\nTrump is correct. In 2018, the number of manufacturing jobs increased by 269,000. That\u2019s the biggest gain since 1997, when employment in the sector increased by 322,000.\n\n\"After years of stagnation, wages are rising fast.\"\n\nOver the past few decades, wages haven\u2019t risen by much above the rate of inflation. Wages have perked up in the past few years, but that trend didn\u2019t start with Trump.\n\nAs this chart of Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows, wages began rising in early 2014, meaning they generally rose for the final three years of Obama\u2019s presidency. Since Trump took office, wages have risen, though a bit more slowly.\n\n\"We passed massive tax cuts, the biggest in the history of our country.\"\n\nThey were big, but not the biggest ever. In inflation-adjusted dollars, the 2017 tax bill is the fourth-largest since 1940. And as a percentage of GDP, it ranks seventh.\n\n\"We will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always.\"\n\nThat\u2019s the promise, though past Republican efforts have fallen short.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies may not look at a person\u2019s health history when setting premiums. The Republican-sponsored Ensuring Coverage for Patients with Pre-Existing Conditions bill in 2018 mimicked the Affordable Care Act\u2019s protections but contained an out for insurance companies to deny certain coverage if \"it will not have the capacity to deliver services adequately.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s decision this week to ask an appellate court to throw out the entire law raised the question of what would replace it should Trump succeed. Congressional Republicans have not coalesced around a plan. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the White House should put one forward.\n\n\"In 2018, drug prices saw their first decline in 46 years.\"\n\nThis takes a number from a couple of months during the year to paint a misleading picture. In 2018, while drug prices didn\u2019t go up as much as in the past, they continued to rise.\n\nThe prescription drug consumer price index for 2018 rose 0.1 percent. That was better than the year before, when it went up 0.5 percent.\n\nA project by the Associated Press on brand-name prescription drug prices found that in the first seven months of 2018, there were 96 price hikes for every price cut.\n\nThe government estimates that drug spending went up 3.3 percent in 2018. That\u2019s different from the cost of drugs, but going forward, Health and Human Service Department analysts see even larger increases in 2019, partly due to a \"modest increase in drug price growth.\"\n\n\"The Democrat(ic) Party has also been aggressively pushing extreme late-term abortion, allowing children to be ripped from their mother's womb, right up until the moment of birth.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s claim is another example of him pushing the envelope in talking about abortion legislation considered by two states and Congress this year.\n\nThere is no question that bills in New York (which passed) and Virginia (which was defeated) would have eased some of the state-level rules governing how abortions are handled, particularly late-term abortions. Still, even the weakened language would not have meant that the decision to undergo a late-term abortion was made lightly. The bills would diminish the amount of oversight but not eliminate it.\n\nMost late-term abortions are prompted by severe medical challenges and tend to be rare; in this sense, Democrats are not \"aggressively pushing\" women to undergo the procedure.\n\nThe push in the U.S. Senate, meanwhile, came from Republicans, not Democrats.\n\nAnti-abortion Republicans put forward legislation called the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. It said that \"any infant born alive after an abortion or within a hospital, clinic, or other facility has the same claim to the protection of the law that would arise for any newborn, or for any person who comes to a hospital, clinic, or other facility for screening and treatment or otherwise becomes a patient within its care.\"\n\nAll but three Senate Democrats voted against the bill, arguing that the scenario it envisioned was already enshrined in law, and that the bill being considered risked problematic unintended consequences.

Record deepness, right? \u2026 And I\u2019m going to get, in honor of my friends, full funding of $300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which you have been trying to get for over 30 years.\"\n\nTrump framed this apparent reversal of his own budget policy as big news. It isn\u2019t clear if that has really happened. Regardless, there is nothing accurate about the funding history he laid out.\n\nTrump\u2019s spoke as though people had been waiting 30 years for this money. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative has been getting over $300 million a year since 2010. Adding the term \"full funding\" doesn\u2019t change things a bit. Full funding refers to the total amount Congress authorizes, which is often less than what is appropriated.\n\nBut the program has hit its full funding target every year.\n\nAs for his promise to fund the program, Trump\u2019s FY 2020 budget slashes funding to $30 million \u2014 a 90 percent cut.\n\n\"It was because of constraints in our budget that it was not fully funded at the authorized amount,\" U.S. Environmental Protection Agency spokesman John Konkus told us. \"I would kindly point you to the President\u2019s statement last night, that he would support full funding for Great Lakes Restoration Initiative at $300 million.\"\n\n\"We are throwing out gangs like MS-13 ... we're throwing them out of our country by the thousands.\"\n\nThis checks out with data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE says that it removed 5,396 \"known or suspected\" gang members in fiscal year 2017; and 5,872 in fiscal year 2018.\n\nICE doesn\u2019t break down how many were known gang members and how many were suspected to have an affiliation. The agency also doesn\u2019t have a break down of deportations per gang affiliation.\n\nIn the last two years alone, ICE officers \"have made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens\u2026including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, 4,000 kidnappings, and 4,000 murders.\"\n\nThis often repeated claim leaves out important context.\n\nFirst, the numbers include people charged, and a charge alone doesn\u2019t mean that a person is guilty. ICE also said a single person could have committed or been charged with multiple crimes. The most common crimes for which immigrants were charged or convicted were traffic, drug, and immigration law violations.", "lang": "en"}
