This led to speculation on social media and mainstream media.\n\nAlt News has received several fact-check requests for the video.\n\nThe same video was viral on May 31 after it was reported earlier in the month that Chinese and Indian troops engaged in a face-off near Pangong Tso lake in eastern Ladakh and Naku La, Sikkim.\n\nThe clip has been revived after the death of at least 20 Indian soldiers in eastern Ladakh\u2019s Galwan valley. It shows Indian and Chinese troopers engaged in stone-pelting. The video is shot from the Indian soldiers\u2019 point of view. They can be seen attacking a Chinese vehicle and an injured army man (presumably Chinese) is lying on the road with his head bleeding. The Chinese soldier is protected by Indian troops with tactile shields.\n\nJournalist Shiv Aroor tweeted the video on June 17 describing it as, \u201cmost recent one from late May in Pangong\u201d.\n\nA video from late May is, therefore, being circulated as a recent incident.", "lang": "en"}
