He cited video from 30 years ago where he argued that a woman could be president.\n\nThat said, the next question to Warren was, \"What did you think when Sen. Sanders told you a woman could not win the election?\"\n\n\"I disagreed,\" Warren said. \"Bernie is my friend, and I am not here to try to fight with Bernie.\"\n\nGiven that only Sanders and Warren were in the room for that exchange, there\u2019s no way to know for sure who said what.\n\nBut there were moments during the two-hour Jan. 14 debate that were ripe for a fact-check. Here are a few:\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., speaks Jan. 14, 2020, during a Democratic presidential primary debate hosted by CNN and the Des Moines Register in Des Moines, Iowa. (AP)\n\nIn the same back-and-forth with Sanders, Warren said that the test of whether a woman could win lies with results.\n\n\"Look at the men on this stage. Collectively, they have lost 10 elections,\" she said. \"The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they\u2019ve been in are the women, Amy and me.\"\n\nWarren\u2019s claim is correct. We rated it True.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of the electoral win-loss records of the six candidates on stage during the debate, according to Ballotpedia.com and the U.S. Election Atlas. To see which elections the candidates lost, read our full fact-check.\n\nTom Steyer: This is Steyer\u2019s first race for public office.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden speaks Jan. 14, 2020, during a Democratic presidential primary debate hosted by CNN and the Des Moines Register in Des Moines, Iowa. (AP )\n\nBiden said Trump \u2018flat out lied\u2019 about why he ordered the strike on Soleimani\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden said that Trump \"flat out lied\" when he said that he ordered the strike against Iran\u2019s Qassem Soleimani \"because our embassies were about to be bombed.\"\n\nWe don\u2019t have access to the intelligence that drove the decision to take Soleimani out. In public statements, Trump\u2019s team has contradicted themselves on the \"imminent threat\" posed by Soleimani and the need for preemptive action against him.\n\nTrump has described the threat a few different ways: as an attack on a single embassy, as an attack on an unspecified number of embassies, and most recently as an attack on four embassies, including the one in Iraq. And, he\u2019s said that \"it doesn\u2019t really matter.\"\n\nIn a Jan. 10 interview with Fox News talk show host Laura Ingraham, Trump said four embassies, including the embassy in Baghdad, were at risk. But top officials did not substantiate Trump\u2019s \"four embassies\" claim on the Sunday news shows.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper said on CBS\u2019s \"Face the Nation\" that he \"didn\u2019t see\" any specific evidence showing Soleimani was planning attacks against four U.S. embassies.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said during a Jan. 9 interview that the intelligence agencies did not know \"precisely when\" or \"precisely where\" any attacks would take place.\n\nNational Security Adviser Robert O\u2019Brien offered more support for Trump\u2019s claim that intelligence showed Iran had drawn up attacks against four U.S. embassies. But he did not provide details.\n\nSeveral lawmakers, including members of both parties, said Esper and Pompeo didn\u2019t mention threats facing four embassies during the classified briefing.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speaks Jan. 14, 2020, during a Democratic presidential primary debate hosted by CNN and the Des Moines Register in Des Moines, Iowa. (AP)\n\nWhere the $100 billion figure in Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All plan came from\n\nBernie Sanders zeroed in on the question of profits in the health care industry during the debate.\n\nUnder \"Medicare for All,\" he said, \"We end the $100 billion a year that the health care industry makes.\"\n\nThe Sanders campaign shared its math, and it\u2019s comprehensive. We rated Sanders\u2019 claim True.\n\nThe $100 billion total comes from adding the 2018 net revenues \u2014 as disclosed by the companies \u2014 for 10 pharmaceutical companies and 10 companies that work in health insurance.\n\nThe total net revenues, or profits, these companies posted in 2018 comes to just more than $100 billion \u2014 $100.96 billion, in fact. We also spoke to three independent health economists, who all told us that the math checks out.\n\nThere are a couple of wrinkles to consider. Some of the companies included do more than just health care. Those other services likely affect their bottom lines.\n\nAlso, $100 billion is likely an underestimate.\n\nThere are more than just 10 pharmaceutical companies, and more than 10 insurance companies. And this figure looks at pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies, but it doesn\u2019t include the biggest source of health care profits: hospitals and physicians.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden speaks Jan. 14, 2020, during a Democratic presidential primary debate hosted by CNN and the Des Moines Register in Des Moines, Iowa. (AP )\n\nWhen did Biden call his vote for the Iraq War a mistake?\n\nThe debate opened with Sanders talking about why he voted against the Iraq War, and Biden explaining why he did. Biden defended himself, pointing out that his regret over the vote..\n\n\"I said 13 years ago it was a mistake to give the president the authority to go to war if, in fact, he couldn\u2019t get inspectors in Iraq to stop what was thought to be the attempt to get a nuclear weapon,\" Biden said. \"It was a mistake, and I acknowledge that.\"\n\nIt was more like 14 to 15 years ago, but this time \u2014 as opposed to previous occasions \u2014 Biden avoided saying that he was against the Iraq War from the very beginning, which he wasn\u2019t.\n\nAround the start of the Iraq War, Biden acknowledged his frustrations with how the United States entered the conflict but said he supported President George W. Bush. He later said that support was a mistake.\n\nIn 2002, Bush argued that former Iraq President Saddam Hussein had chemical and biological weapons and sought nuclear weapons. In October of that year, as a Delaware senator, Biden voted in favor of a resolution that authorized Bush to use military force against Iraq if needed.\n\nIn a Senate speech before voting for the resolution, Biden said that \"failure to overwhelmingly support\" the measure was \"likely to enhance the prospects that war will occur.\" In a March 19, 2003, interview with CNN \u2014 the day before the U.S. invaded Iraq \u2014 Biden doubled down on his commitment to the war.\n\n\"I support the president. I support the troops. We should make no distinction,\" Biden said. \"We should have one voice going out to the whole world that we're together. There's plenty to criticize this president for. Let's get this war done.\"\n\nAt a Brookings Institution event in July 2003, Biden criticized the Bush administration\u2019s approach to the Iraq War while still defending his vote.\n\nThen, in a November 2005 interview on NBC\u2019s \"Meet the Press,\" Biden went a step further and said his 2002 vote was a mistake.\n\n\"It was a mistake,\" Biden said. \"It was a mistake to assume the president would use the authority we gave him properly. \u2026 We gave the president the authority to unite the world to isolate Saddam. And the fact of the matter is, we went too soon. We went without sufficient force. And we went without a plan.\"\n\n\"Back in 1986, I introduced the first climate change bill. And check PolitiFacts (sic) \u2014 they said it was a game-changer,\" Biden said during the debate.\n\nBiden made this same claim during the fifth Democratic debate in Atlanta in November. We found that Biden was one of the first U.S. lawmakers to introduce climate change legislation. But for the record: We did not call it a game-changer.\n\nHere\u2019s what we wrote in November:\n\nHis first climate change bill was introduced in 1986, but it died in the Senate. The next year, a version of Biden\u2019s legislation became an amendment to a State Department funding bill. President Ronald Reagan signed it into law.\n\nBiden\u2019s Global Climate Protection Act called on the president to set up a task force to plan how to mitigate global warming. It also called on the president to make climate change a higher priority item on the U.S.-Soviet agenda.\n\nWhile Congress had focused on the issue before, most experts we spoke to said Biden\u2019s bill was the first climate change legislation of its kind. However, those same experts also cautioned against overstating the importance of the bill. It didn\u2019t introduce a plan for reducing emissions or adapting infrastructure for climate change.\n\n\"It was a plan to make a plan. Which, of course, neither Reagan nor Bush ultimately did,\" Josh Howe, a professor of history and environmental studies at Reed College, previously told PolitiFact.", "lang": "en"}
