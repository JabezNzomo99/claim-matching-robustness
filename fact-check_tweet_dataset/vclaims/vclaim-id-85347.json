Bill Maher: \u2018Then why doesn\u2019t your party come out against the Second Amendment? It\u2019s the problem.\u2019 Your response: \u2018I sure wish they would. I sure wish they would.\u2019 \u201d\n\nEllison: \u201cI wish you\u2019d play the tape, because if you did you\u2019d see that it did not go that way. But the real point is this, this country \u2014 absolutely, I am for the right to bear arms, but I am not for these massive murders that happen all over this country every day.\u201d\n\n \u2014 exchange during CNN debate with candidates for Democratic National Committee leadership, Feb. 22, 2017\n\nDuring the debate on CNN, Ellison denied making comments about the Second Amendment during a March 2014 interview on \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher.\u201d We were curious to know exactly what he said during the interview, and whether he was being truthful in his response to Bash.\n\nEarlier in the clip, Ellison talks about family members who own guns and go hunting, and says that he is \u201cfor gun control, but I don\u2019t think you have got to eliminate ownership of all guns in order to get some common-sense gun rules.\u201d\n\nThe crowd laughs, and then Sheila Bair, former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., interjects. She seems to say: \u201cFifty-one votes, that\u2019s all it takes.\u201d The crowd, Bair and Ellison all laugh. Ellison then says: \u201cI sure wish they would, I sure wish they would.\u201d\n\nBair, through a spokesman, said the \u201cvote\u201d she was referring to was the nomination of former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. At the time of this interview, Murthy had been waiting for confirmation for 16 months and could not get the 51 votes in the Senate to get confirmed. \u201cShe thinks that nomination started the conversation [about gun control]. But it was a long time ago,\u201d her spokesman said.\n\nSheila Bair: I\u2019m a Republican and I\u2019m for gun control. I just want to be \u2014 it\u2019s not monolithic.\n\n Keith Ellison: Well, I\u2019m for gun control, too. Let me just say, I\u2019m for gun control but I don\u2019t think you have got to eliminate ownership of all guns in order to get some common-sense gun rules.\n\n Bair: No, you don\u2019t.\n\n Ellison: I mean, 27 children were mowed down. Isn\u2019t that enough for us? One of our colleagues, [former congresswoman] Gabby Giffords, shot in the face.\n\n Maher: Then why doesn\u2019t your party come out against the Second Amendment? It\u2019s the problem.\n\n [Crosstalk]\n\n Ellison: Bill \u2014\n\n Bair: Fifty-one votes, that\u2019s all it takes.\n\n [Laughter]\n\n Ellison: I sure wish they would. I sure wish they would.\n\n Maher: Really?\n\n Ellison: Yeah.\n\n Maher: Because I never hear anybody in the Democratic Party say that. But they say, \u201cI am also a strong supporter.\u201d\n\n Ellison: You have got to check out the progressive caucus. We have come out very strong for common-sense gun safety rules.\n\nAfter some back-and-forth with Maher, Ellison later says: \u201cYou can\u2019t solve the problem with just one little thing. You\u2019ve got to make sure that the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] can issue reports on gun killings and handgun violence. You\u2019ve got to make sure that we can get rid of assault weapons. You\u2019ve got to close the loophole at gun shows. You\u2019ve got to do a whole range of things to get us into a sane place. We\u2019ve got 12,000 handgun murders a year. It\u2019s got to stop.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear whether Ellison really was talking about Murthy\u2019s nomination, the Second Amendment or votes on gun-control measures in general. But it is clear throughout the interview that Ellison says he supports both gun-control measures and the rights of gun owners. At one point, he says he is \u201cfor gun control, but I don\u2019t think you have got to eliminate ownership of all guns in order to get some common-sense gun rules.\u201d\n\nOf course, supporters of gun rights likely would consider the measures Ellison proposes as effectively gutting Second Amendment rights. Still, there seems to be more going on in the conversation that is not immediately clear in the transcripts that Dana Bash read during the debate. A constitutional amendment that would have nullified the Second Amendment would require a two-thirds vote by the House and Senate, and then ratification by three-fourths of the states. So Bair\u2019s interjection of \u201c51 votes\u201d makes it likely that the exchange was alluding to Murthy\u2019s confirmation, rather than a constitutional amendment.", "lang": "en"}
