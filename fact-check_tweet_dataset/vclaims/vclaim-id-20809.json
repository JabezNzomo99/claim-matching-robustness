A video of Slepakov performing the tune was posted on Facebook on June 11 -- three days before the start of the 2018 World Cup, which is being hosted by Russia \u2013 and it instantly became a social media hit.\n\nSlepakov\u2019s satirical song hits on many of the issues surrounding Russia\u2019s preparation for the World Cup. These include the country\u2019s economic stagnation, corruption, and overexploitation of natural resources; the incompetence of government agencies; and even the Kremlin\u2019s use of information warfare.\n\nA line in the song -- \u201cIt\u2019s not for nothing we terrified [the planet] with a missile\u201d -- seems to be a reference to President Vladimir Putin\u2019s demonstration on March 1 of what he called an \u201cinvincible ballistic missile.\u201d\n\nAfter Slepakov sings that Russia is ready for the World Cup, he adds: \u201cBut there is only one \u201cbut\u201d: Our team, frankly, is sh-t.\u201d\n\nTo prove his point, the comedian introduces into his song Russia\u2019s most controversial political figure \u2013 the head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.\n\nSlepakov sings that the Russian team would not be capable of winning the World Cup even if President Putin were to appoint Kadyrov as its new coach, which would represent an imminent death threat to team members.\n\nHand-picked and favored by Putin, Kadyrov has repeatedly declared his loyalty to the Russian president and calls himself Putin\u2019s \u201cfoot soldier.\u201d\n\nKadyrov is also widely seen as the most feared man in Russia, due to his record of human rights abuses and alleged personal participation in torturing of the prisoners held in secret locations.\n\nDespite the satirical form of Slepakov\u2019s song and its use of hyperbole, it is in general factually accurate, and his assessment of the Russian national team corresponds with the FIFA\u2019s ranking.\n\nIn FIFA\u2019s June 7, 2018 ranking, the Russian national team was ranked 70th among the world\u2019s 206 national teams, and given a \u201cworst mover\u201d red label.\n\nThis latest FIFA ranking is the Russian national team\u2019s lowest, having dropped from 20th place in 2014.\n\nIf Russia, which qualified automatically as the hosts, cannot muster a win against Saudi Arabia in the opening match on Thursday, the team will equal a winless record set in 1912, when the country was still ruled by Tsar Nicholas II, and matched in 1998, the Russian newspaper The Moscow Times reported.\n\nMore than 145 million Russians are football fans, but the national team and its fans have been accused bad behavior, including racism and violence.\n\nStill, President Vladimir Putin promised the World Cup in Russia will be flawless.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kremlin said on June 14, that 15 foreign leaders attended the World Cup\u2019s opening ceremony. They included eight from neighboring former Soviet countries and two from South Ossetia and Abkhazia -- the Russian-backed breakaway regions of Georgia.", "lang": "en"}
