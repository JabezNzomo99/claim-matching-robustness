Split into two nights to accommodate the 20 candidates who qualified for the debate stage, the first 10 candidates fielded questions on topics ranging from climate change to health care.\n\nPBS covered the event, at one point sharing this surprising stat on Facebook: \u201cIt was 16 minutes into the debate before President Donald Trump\u2019s name was uttered.\u201d\n\nThe post links to a PBS article titled \u201cTrump mentions are scarce in Democratic presidential debate,\u201d which includes the same stat.\n\nOther outlets offered similar analysis: The Hill said the president was \u201calmost entirely unmentioned\u201d during the debate, while The Atlantic jested that \u201cthe Resistance was dozing off on a couch.\u201d But PBS\u2019s specific claim \u2013 that 16 minutes passed before someone mentioned Trump by name \u2013 doesn\u2019t hold up.\n\nFrom the time moderators Savannah Guthrie and Lester Holt welcomed viewers to the Democratic debate to when Trump\u2019s name was first invoked, a little more than 4 minutes elapsed. Skipping over some introductory remarks from the moderators, as well as the on-air graphics that kicked off the program, about two minutes passed.\n\nIt was Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the second candidate to speak that night, who first mentioned Trump.\n\n\u201cWell, first, the economy. We know that not everyone is sharing in this prosperity,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Donald Trump just sits in the White House and gloats about what\u2019s going on, when you have so many people that are having trouble affording college and having trouble affording their premiums.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar mentioned Trump nine times during the debate, the most of any candidate, according to an analysis by NBC News. In total, NBC recorded 35 instances where Trump came up. (CNN tallied slightly different numbers.)\n\nA transcript from that night, published by The Washington Post, returned more than a dozen instances of candidates mentioning Trump by name. At other points, rather than uttering his name, candidates either alluded to or referred to Trump as the president.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s recognize the situation we\u2019re in, that the American people deserve a president who will put your interests ahead of the rich and powerful. That\u2019s not what we have right now,\u201d argued Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.\n\nThe Associated Press also claimed that 16 minutes elapsed before the first mention of Trump, although the AP promptly corrected its reporting. \u201cThis item has been corrected to show that Klobuchar uttered Trump\u2019s name a few minutes into the debate, not 16 minutes into the debate,\u201d reads a correction from the wire service.", "lang": "en"}
