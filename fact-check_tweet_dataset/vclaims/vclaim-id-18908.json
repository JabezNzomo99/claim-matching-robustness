The post gives the impression that the Constitution is biased on the teaching of religious text.\n\nIndia Today's Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that there is no Article 30(A) in the Constitution of India that prevents from reading Gita as claimed.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nThe post is viral on both Facebook and Twitter with the text that reads: \"Article 30: - Quran can be taught in the madrasas! Article 30(A): - Geeta can not be read in schools! Credit goes to Jawaharlal Nehru ...\"\n\nTo verify the claim, we checked the article in the Constitution and found that Article 30(A) does not even exist. The sub-clause to Article 30 is Article 30(1A).\n\nArticle 30 of the India Constitution states the right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions.\n\nArticle 30(1) says that all minorities, whether based on religion or language, shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.\n\nArticle 30(1A) deals with the fixation of the amount for acquisition of property of any educational institution established by minority groups.\n\nArticle 30(2) states that the government should not discriminate against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority, whether based on religion or language, while giving aid.\n\nWhat does expert say?\n\nIndia Today got in touch with former secretary-general of Lok Sabha PDT Achary, who told us that there is no mention about any religious text in the Constitution. Our Constitution is secular and does not contain any provisions which suggest that the Quran can be taught in madrasas and Gita cannot be read in schools.\n\nIt is clear that no provision under Article 30 talks about teaching Bhagavad Gita or the Quran in schools.", "lang": "en"}
