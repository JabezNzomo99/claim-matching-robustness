No, that's not true. Writer Paul Joseph Watson took a U.N. study published in 2000 calculating several possible scenarios for the evolution of the population of various countries with low fertility rates and then declared this was a \"UN plan\" that got \"revealed\" somehow in 2018. It obviously is not.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Infowars on July 24, 2018 titled \"Revealed: UN Plan to Flood America With 600 Million Migrants\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nA 2001 UN strategy document is getting fresh attention in light of the migrant crisis because it outlines the need to flood America and Europe with hundreds of millions of migrants in order to maintain population levels. Entitled Replacement Migration: Is It a Solution to Declining and Ageing Populations?, the plan seeks to \"offset population decline and population ageing resulting from low fertility and mortality rates.\" It contends that mass migration to the west is needed for governments to maintain \"many established economic, social and political policies and programmes\". The strategy document sets out six potential scenarios for each country or region of the world necessary to meet this goal. Under the most severe scenario, large numbers of migrants will be required to \"maintain the potential support ratio\" (of a population) at the highest level.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail, in which no mention is made that it was just a study and that the numbers cited were only from one of several possible scenarios:\n\nThe study in question looked at countries with low birth rates and longer life spans and calculated what would happen given various possible changes in immigration, fertility numbers, working age etc. in order to see how many people of working age would be available to support non-working senior citizens by 2050.\n\nIt didn't recommend or favor any of the possible scenarios, and none of them have any force of law or should be considered as a \"plan\". The conclusions of the study are an interesting read, and they mention several other possible solutions to the problem of declining and ageing populations, along with several potential downsides of mass immigration that should be considered:\n\nFinally, the new challenges being brought about by declining and ageing populations will require\n\nobjective, thorough and comprehensive reassessments of many established economic, social and political\n\npolicies and programmes. Such reassessments will need to incorporate a long-term perspective. Critical\n\nissues to be addressed in those reassessments would include (a) appropriate ages for retirement; (b) levels,\n\ntypes and nature of retirement and health-care benefits for the elderly; (c) labour-force participation; (d)\n\nassessed amounts of contributions from workers and employers needed to support retirement and healthcare\n\nbenefits for the increasing elderly population; and (e) policies and programmes relating to\n\ninternational migration, in particular replacement migration, and the integration of large numbers of\n\nrecent migrants and their descendants. In this context, it should be noted that immigrants to one country\n\nare emigrants from another country. As such, international migration must be seen as part of the larger\n\nglobalization process taking place throughout the world, influencing the economic, political and cultural\n\ncharacter of both sending and receiving countries. While orderly international migration can provide\n\ncountries of origin with remittances and facilitate the transfer of skills and technology, it also may entail\n\nthe loss of needed human resources. Similarly, international migration can provide countries of\n\ndestination with needed human resources and talent, but may also give rise to social tensions. Effective\n\ninternational migration policies must therefore take into account the impact on both the host society and\n\ncountries of origin.\n\nWhatever this study is, it is definitely not a \"plan\" to \"flood\" America with 600 million migrants. The Infowars article on the other hand can be classified as scaremongering clickbait that relies on people not clicking the actual links in the article.\n\nWe wrote about infowars.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Top UN Inspector Did NOT Say Assad Not Responsible For Chemical Weapons Attack\n\u2022 Fake News: Alex Jones Did NOT Say Obama Hired Kenyan Witch Doctors To Read Trump's Mind", "lang": "en"}
