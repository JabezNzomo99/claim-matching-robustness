FARA simply requires transparency and public disclosure on the part of those registered.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s most recent FARA report to the U.S. Congress, there are at least seven foreign media groups registered as foreign agents in the U.S.:\n\u2022 None Two Chinese media groups: the Daily Distribution Corporation and the People's Daily Overseas Edition;\n\nNone of the above have ever complained about \u201cexperiencing active pressure\u201d or being \u201cliterally expelled\u201d by the U.S. government.\n\nThe registration process for the Foreign Agent Registration Act requires filling out and submitting three forms:\n\u2022 None Registration Statement Pursuant to the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, as amended;\n\u2022 None Exhibit A to Registration Statement Pursuant to the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, as amended;\n\u2022 None Exhibit B to Registration Statement Pursuant to the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, as amended;\n\nAn applicant is required to provide information on the nature of its activities, the name of any \u201cforeign principal\u201d on whose behalf they are working (meaning foreign governments, political parties, organizations or individuals), a statement on the ownership and control of the applicant, and financial information (including contributions, income and money received).\n\n\u201cTo date, we have not experienced\u2026\u201d\n\nIn Great Britain, RT has been the target of 15 probes by Ofcom, the UK media regulatory body, for breaching codes and standards on impartiality and unbiased reporting, and for broadcasting materially misleading content. In November 2104, Ofcom announced that it was putting RT \"on notice that any future breaches of the due impartiality rules may result in further regulatory action, including consideration of a statutory sanction.\"\n\nDuring a meeting with President Vladimir Putin in 2012, then Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman reportedly complained about \u201canti-Israel propaganda\u201d being broadcast by RT.\n\nUkraine banned RT in August 2014 for \u201cdeliberately inciting hatred and discord among Ukrainian citizens.\u201d\n\nIn August 2015, Spain\u2019s BBVA bank blocked payments to RT after the European Union imposed sanctions on Russian officials over Moscow\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\n\nIn October 2016, Britain\u2019s NatWest bank, part of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, froze RT\u2019s bank accounts in the UK.\n\nThe European Parliament adopted a resolution in 2015 calling RT \u201cRussia\u2019s main international media weapon.\u201d A counter-propaganda group called EastStratCom Task Force was subsequently created and an EU vs Disinformation website launched.\n\nThis past April, the campaign team of Emmanuel Macron, then still a candidate for French president, banned RT and its counterpart Sputnik from campaign events, accusing it of seeking to spread \u201cfake news and false information.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
