The claim is false; video and photos of the May 18, 2019 posted by Modi and Indian media show he was wearing socks and not shoes.\n\nThe photo was published here in a Facebook post on May 19, 2019, and it has been shared more than 15,000 times.\n\nThe post's Hindi language caption translates to English as: \u201cKing of Hindu hearts is going to Baba\u2019s temple wearing shoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cKing of Hindu hearts\u201d is a reference to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Here is his official Twitter page and here is a report that describes him as \u2018King of Hindu hearts\u2019.\n\n\u201cBaba\u201d refers to Hindu deity Lord Shiva. Modi recently visited a temple dedicated to Shiva in the north Indian state of Uttarakhand. Here is a report on the May 18, 2019 visit to the Kedarnath temple, in which Modi describes Lord Shiva as \u2018Baba Kedarnath\u2019 while talking to reporters outside the shrine.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe photo has also been shared here, here and here on Facebook, and here, here and here on Twitter with an identical claim.\n\nThe claim is false. A careful examination of photographs published by Indian media and posted on Prime Minister Mod\u2019s official Twitter page here and website here, show that Modi was wearing socks not shoes inside the temple.\n\nBelow are two screenshots of two images shared on Modi\u2019s Twitter page on May 18, 2019. The first image (L) shows wearing wearing a pair of black shoes outside outside the temple; in the second image (R) he can be seen walking out of the temple wearing socks.\n\nBelow are two close up images of his feet taken from the above pictures:\n\nIn a video published on Narendra Modi\u2019s official website here, a pair of thick woolen socks can be seen next to a sofa where Modi stopped to remove his shoes before entering the temple.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the sofa and socks:\n\nModi\u2019s black shoes also be seen next to the sofa in this video published on India\u2019s state-run broadcaster Rajya Sabha TV on May 18, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot showing the shoes next to the sofa:\n\nModi can be seen sitting on the sofa and removing his shoes and putting on the thick woolen socks at 8:32 in this video, published on the YouTube channel of India\u2019s national broadcaster DD News on May 17, 2019.", "lang": "en"}
