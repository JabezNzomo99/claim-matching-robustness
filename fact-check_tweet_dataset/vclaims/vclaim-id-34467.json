Similarly, the claim is also widely circulating on Twitter.\n\nBOOM found that the image is originally from Basabaid village, Ghatail taluka, in Tangail district of Bangladesh where the boy in the image was punished for harassing a school student in 2017. The boy was known to frequently harass the school student.\n\nThis incident occurred on April 2017, after the boy, a 12th grade student from Sagardighi College, used to frequently harass this school student. Before this incident, the boy had tried to pull the girl's hand according to reports BOOM found in two Bangla newspapers, Kalerkantho and Daily Marsangbad. When the village elders tried to catch him, he ran away on his scooter.\n\nThe parents of the girl student created an uproar and Mostafa was caught red-handed as well as punished for his activities. The garland was made from the shoes of the girls in the school.\n\nThe article further states that Mozammel Haque, the head teacher of the school said that they wanted to set an example against sexual harassment.\n\nNone of the articles had any mention of the boy committing suicide after this episode.", "lang": "en"}
