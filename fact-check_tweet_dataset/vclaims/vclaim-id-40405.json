No, that's not true: a story reporting on an interview Lynch gave to The Guardian in 2018 attributes several things to him that are not actually in the interview and the claims were widely copied later by various unreliable sites.\n\nThe story originated from an article (archived here) published by NewsPunch where it was published on June 24, 2018 under the title \"David Lynch: Trump Is Destroying The 'New World Order'\". It opened:\n\nAmerican filmmaker David Lynch says President Trump could go down as one of the greatest presidents in history if he continues destroying the 'New World Order'. The \"Twin Peaks\" creator claims that New World Order elitists are unable to counter Trump's superior intellect and, as a result, are acting like \"frightened children.\" \"He could go down as one of the greatest presidents in history because he has disrupted the thing so much,\" Lynch said of the elite in a wide-ranging interview with The Guardian. \"No one is able to counter this guy in an intelligent way.\"\n\nThe actual Guardian story (archived here) does not even contain the phrase \"New World Order\" or the words \"elite\" or \"elitists\":\n\nThe NewsPunch story also made it sound like Lynch is supporting Trump way more than what the interview actually says:\n\nPolitically, meanwhile, Lynch is all over the map. He voted for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary and thinks - he's not sure - he voted Libertarian in the presidential election. \"I am not really a political person, but I really like the freedom to do what you want to do,\" says the persecuted Californian smoker. He is undecided about Donald Trump. \"He could go down as one of the greatest presidents in history because he has disrupted the thing so much. No one is able to counter this guy in an intelligent way.\" While Trump may not be doing a good job himself, Lynch thinks, he is opening up a space where other outsiders might. \"Our so-called leaders can't take the country forward, can't get anything done. Like children, they are. Trump has shown all this.\"\n\nWhen contacted by Lead Stories the NewsPunch story was updated with a correction that read:\n\nBut since the original story was published it was stolen by dozens of copycat sites repeating the claim hoping to attract clicks and earn money through advertising.
