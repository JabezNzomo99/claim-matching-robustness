The caption also says to be \u201cpatient\u201d since President Rodrigo Duterte was \u201cdoing everything\u201d for the once-besieged Mindanao city.\n\nThe photo was also used by Haddon Communities, an Ohio real estate company, on the landing page of its website.\n\n\n\nThis is not the first time that a wrong photo was used to mislead the public about the status of housing projects in Marawi City.\n\nOn October 2, a photo uploaded on Facebook by a pro-Imee Marcos for Senator page supposedly showed the housing projects in Marawi City, but it was actually a photo of a Japanese housing project in Japan built after the 2011 tsunamis and earthquake in that country.\n\nThere is indeed a post-siege housing project in Marawi City. The project was inaugurated on March 1. Photos of the houses can be seen in Inquirer, Rappler, Philstar, MindaNews, and the Philippine Information Agency.\n\nAfter delays, the groundbreaking for the rehabilitated Marawi City is set on October 30. The city mayor has appealed for more livelihood programs. \u2014 Miguel Imperial/Rappler.com\n\nIf you suspect a Facebook page, group, account, a website, or an article is spreading false information, let Rappler know by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
