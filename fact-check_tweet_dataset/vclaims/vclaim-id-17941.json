Parents and teachers are already worrying about what they call the \u2018Trump Effect.\u2019 They report that bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools, especially targeting students of color, Muslims, and immigrants.\"\n\nWe wondered if Clinton is right teachers are reporting an increase in bullying and harassment and if so, what does it have to do with Trump?\n\nClinton\u2019s source is an April report out of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights and antidiscrimination advocacy group. The report is titled \"The Trump Effect: The impact of the presidential campaign on our nation\u2019s schools.\"\n\nThe center conducted an online survey of approximately 2,000 K-12 teachers and found: \"Teachers have noted an increase in bullying, harassment and intimidation of students whose races, religions or nationalities have been the verbal targets of candidates on the campaign trail.\"\n\nWhile their findings correspond directly with Clinton\u2019s claim, it\u2019s important to note that this was not a scientific survey, as the report notes. The respondents don\u2019t represent a random sample of teachers, and it\u2019s likely that those who chose to respond to the survey are those who are most concerned about the campaign\u2019s impact on students.\n\nThis means it would be inaccurate to extrapolate from the survey that bullying and harassment are generally on the rise across the country. Rather, it is more a collection of teachers\u2019 anecdotal experiences.\n\nWe looked for a scientific study that speaks to this same question but couldn\u2019t find one, mostly because there tends to be a lag in this kind of data, meaning data on bullying trends in 2016 won\u2019t get published until 2017 or later. The process of setting up and getting approval to conduct a scientific study is lengthy and cumbersome, and would not be approved before the election, said Sheri Bauman, a professor at the University of Arizona who researches bullying.\n\nEven so, Bauman said the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s report should not be dismissed, as its data show important recurring themes.\n\nHere are some interesting details from the survey. Keep in mind that the survey did not mention any candidate names whatsoever:\n\u2022 Respondents gave a total of 5,000 comments. Of those, one in five mentioned Trump. All other candidates were mentioned fewer than 200 times combined. \u201cWe\u2019re the only major gas-producing state in the US that doesn\u2019t have a severance tax.\u201d\n\u2022 \"More than one-third have observed an increase in anti-Muslim or anti-immigrant sentiment.\"\n\u2022 \"Teachers report that students have been \u2018emboldened\u2019 to use slurs, engage in name-calling and make inflammatory statements toward each other,\" and \"Kids use the names of candidates as pejoratives to taunt each other.\"\n\u2022 \"More than two-thirds of the teachers reported that students \u2014 mainly immigrants, children of immigrants and Muslims \u2014 have expressed concerns or fears about what might happen to them or their families after the election.\"\n\nOn the otherhand, the bullying can be contrary to the depiction that Clinton offered. The survey also noted examples of students getting bullied by others because they or their parents support Trump.\n\nThe findings support Clinton\u2019s claim, said Maureen Costello, the report\u2019s author and director of the center\u2019s Teaching Tolerance project.\n\n\"It\u2019s fair to say the reports say teachers who respond to us are in fact seeing an increase in the quantity of harassment and change in quality of bullying,\" Costello said, adding that she has received upwards of 300 unsolicited additional comments from educators since the report came out, all expressing similar sentiments.\n\n\"I suspect (Clinton) might be right, but the data are not there to support the statement from a scientific-evidence-based perspective,\" said Dorothy Espelage, a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign and a leading expert in bullying.\n\nA Trump spokesman dismissed the survey, noting that it was unscientific.\n\nClinton said, \"Parents and teachers are already worrying about what they call the \u2018Trump Effect.\u2019 They report that bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools, especially targeting students of color, Muslims, and immigrants.\"\n\nTeachers surveyed by the Southern Poverty Law Center study reported an increase in bullying and harassment, particularly involving anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim sentiments. Many of these teachers, unsolicited, cited Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric and the accompanying discourse as the likely reason for this behavior.\n\nThe term Trump Effect is a product of the survey\u2019s authors. And the survey is unscientific because it's based on anecdotal reports. But experts in bullying told us the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s survey and their sense of current trends in schools supports Clinton\u2019s point.\n\nWe rate her claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
