And we explained how it is largely accurate to say Wisconsin manufacturing jobs are both up under Trump or to say they\u2019re down in the last year.\n\nBut Pence\u2019s claim is broader, so we\u2019ll give this another go.\n\nPence\u2019s claim largely matches up with the latest jobs data, and actually understates the change a bit.\n\nThe number of jobs in Wisconsin rose from 2.94 million in January 2017 \u2014 when Trump was sworn in \u2014 to 2.98 million in October 2019, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That\u2019s a difference of 40,900.\n\nThose tallies show non-farm, seasonally adjusted jobs from the agency\u2019s Current Employment Statistics \u2014 an estimate based on a monthly survey of a sampling of companies. But the gap is about the same using other breakdowns of the data.\n\nFor example, Wisconsin\u2019s job count has risen by 44,400 since January 2017 if you look at BLS data for all private-sector jobs (eliminating government positions from the equation).\n\nBut this uptick isn\u2019t exactly a new phenomenon. The number of Wisconsin jobs has risen every year since 2010, when the trend headed up nationally in the wake of the Great Recession.\n\nAnd recent data tells a different story. The monthly jobs data shows a loss of 9,300 jobs from January 2019 to October 2019.\n\nWhich brings us to the implication in Pence\u2019s claim \u2014 that Trump deserves credit for the uptick since 2017.\n\nExperts say you can\u2019t give a president full credit or full blame for job gains (or losses) on their watch.\n\n\"The President can claim some credit for creating an economic environment nationally in which jobs are being created,\" Abdur Chowdhury, professor emeritus of economics at Marquette University, said in an email. \"However \u2026 there are many local factors which affect job creation at the state level including, but not limited to, state employment policy, business environment, national economic trends, tax policy, etc.\"\n\nDennis Winters, chief economist for the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, cautioned against giving Trump too much credit in our earlier examination of state manufacturing jobs. He noted Trump took office during an \"expanding business cycle\" that would inherently lead to more jobs.\n\nPence said 36,000 jobs have been created in Wisconsin since Trump took office.\n\nIt\u2019s an oversimplification to imply, as Pence does, that Trump deserves the credit for that bump. Jobs have actually trended in the other direction so far this year -- and changes in either direction are the product of many factors, not just who occupies the Oval Office.\n\nBut Pence\u2019s number lines ups with \u2014 and actually understates \u2014 the gains since January 2017, according to the latest data.\n\nFor a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, our rating is Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
