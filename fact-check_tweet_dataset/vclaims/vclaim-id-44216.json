Riches confirmed that he is the man in the photo but claims the hat and hand have been superimposed into it.\n\nChauvin and three other Minneapolis police officers were fired after a video surfaced of Chauvin kneeling on the neck of a black man, even after the man, Floyd, repeatedly said he could not breathe. Floyd later died at a hospital.\n\nAmid the national outcry over Floyd\u2019s death, social media users started sharing on May 27 a real photo of Chauvin juxtaposed with another picture of a man wearing a \u201cMake Whites Great Again\u201d hat. They claim the picture on the right also shows the former Minneapolis police officer.\n\n\u201cThis is the Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin that killed #GeorgeFloyd wearing a custom made hat that says, \u2018Make Whites Great Again,'\u201d reads one Facebook post that has since been deleted.\n\nThe picture also has circulated widely on Twitter, where it has been labeled \u201cmanipulated media.\u201d\n\nThe man pictured on the right is not Chauvin, but rather Riches, an internet troll and former federal inmate known for posting misleading photos online and filing thousands of lawsuits, per the Washington Post.\n\nRiches confirmed in a Facebook message to the Daily Caller News Foundation that it is him in the photo, but claimed that the hat and the hand, which appears to be forming the OK sign that has been used by white supremacists, have been digitally inserted into the image.\n\n\u201cThat is a photoshopped hat that I have no idea who did,\u201d Riches told the DCNF. \u201cI think the Hand is photoshopped too.\u201d (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Gov Kemp Posing With Gregory McMichael?)\n\nRiches was unable to provide the original picture. It was first posted to Riches\u2019 wall by a Facebook user who claims to be one of Riches\u2019 relatives, and other Facebook users have shared screen grabs of it, according to Snopes. The background and style of the photo being shared online appear to match others found on Riches\u2019 Facebook page.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
