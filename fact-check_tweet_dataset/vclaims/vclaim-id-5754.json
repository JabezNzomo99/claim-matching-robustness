The post alleges that this difference is generally a good indicator of whether a snake is dangerous or not. This claim contains a mixture of accurate and inaccurate information.\n\nThe post shows a what appears to be a copperhead snake moving on the surface of water. It is visible here .\n\nReuters contacted a few herpetologists, or reptile and amphibian experts, to address the veracity of this claim.\n\nJohn Maerz, Professor of Vertebrate Ecology at the University of Georgia, told Reuters that all snakes can swim, and most swim below the water, or partially submerged. \u201cSnakes may swim under water when fleeing a predator or to hunt,\u201d Maerz wrote, \u201cand species like cottonmouths do eat fish and frogs just like water snakes.\u201d\n\nIn his book \u201cSecrets of Snakes\u201d, David Steen, Reptile and Amphibian Research Leader of the Fish and Wildlife Research Institute in St Petersburg, Florida, also writes that distinguishing between venomous and non-venomous snakes by the way they swim might not be a foolproof strategy. Steen points to the example of the diamond-backed rattlesnake, which is venomous and dangerous to humans. This rattlesnake is known to increase its buoyancy to cross water with most of its body staying dry. He notes that cottonmouth snakes, which are venomous and dangerous to humans, are also capable of doing this, despite often swimming underwater ( rb.gy/kics5e ).\n\nHarry Greene, Emeritus Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Cornell University, told Reuters via email that he would not want to generalize for the more than 3,500 snake species worldwide, nor even for all the venomous snakes in the world.\n\nBut sticking to the southeastern United States and focusing on the cottonmouth and its close relative the copperhead, \u201cboth of those species tend to float with full body on the surface\u201d, Greene said, as do rattlesnakes.\n\nGreene told Reuters that non-venomous water snakes \u201cgenerally swim and float at the surface with only their head (maybe also neck) above the water,\u201d with the rest of their bodies at least at a slight angle below the surface. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t grab a snake or not [though] based just on that criterion!\u201d Greene wrote.\n\nPartly false. While some snakes behave in the way described in the post, experts do not recommend that as a definitive test of whether a snake is venomous or not.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
