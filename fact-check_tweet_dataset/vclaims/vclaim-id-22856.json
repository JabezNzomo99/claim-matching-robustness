Nowhere in his written body of work does such a phrase appear.

The first known attribution to Twain was printed in 1942.\n\n\u201cCurrently, there is no substantive evidence that Mark Twain wrote or said a version of this expression,\u201d the site concluded. \u201cHe was connected to the saying decades after his death.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
