On June 18, China released 10 Indian army personnel, including a lieutenant colonel and three majors, from their custody.\n\nIn the backdrop of this, Dr Anand Rai, best known for exposing the Vyapam scam, tweeted an image of a soldier whose back is severely injured. \u201cThis is one of the soldiers who survived the barbaric attack by Chinese forces on galwan valley. He has nail injuries all over his body. They were completely unarmed and yet they fought back the Chinese army. \u092b\u093c\u094c\u091c \u0915\u094b \u0939\u0925\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0930 \u0909\u0920\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0938\u0947 \u0915\u093f\u0938\u0928\u0947 \u0930\u094b\u0915\u093e \u0925\u093e (why were soldiers stopped from using weapons) @PMOIndia,\u201d wrote Rai. (archive link)\n\nThe image was shared in the backdrop of claims that the Chinese side attacked Indian soldiers with nail-studded clubs.\n\nAlt News has also received requests to fact-check this on WhatsApp (+917600011160) and on our official Android application.\n\nAlt News performed a Google reverse image search of the image and found that it was published by several Thai-blogs in 2016.\n\nOne of the earliest blogs to publish this image was kaupyime.blogpost.com.\n\nAlt News couldn\u2019t independently verify the context behind the photograph. However, it was posted on several Thailand-based blogs in 2016, thus the claim by Dr Anand Rai that the image shows an Indian soldier wounded in the recent India-China dispute is false. Dr Rai has often been found sharing misinformation on social media.", "lang": "en"}
