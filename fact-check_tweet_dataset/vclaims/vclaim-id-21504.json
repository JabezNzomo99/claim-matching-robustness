It was accompanied by a photo, which said that the SOGIE equality bill will \u201cundercut\u201d parental authority, religious freedom, freedom of conscience, and freedom of expression. It will also impose the lifestyle of LGBTQ+ on straight people and silence the \u201cstraight community,\u201d the post read.\n\nBongbong Marcos-Sara Duterte 2022\u2019s post was shared over 15,000 times on Facebook. It also garnered over 5,700 reactions and 5,200 comments as of writing and was flagged by Facebook Claim check, the social media network\u2019s tool that identifies suspicious posts.\n\nThe page credited a certain Facebook user Abad C Jhun as its source. Abad C Jhun posted the same content on his timeline on August 28, but it did not receive any engagements.\n\nThe facts: The SOGIE equality bill is an anti-discrimination bill that prohibits unfair treatment on the basis of a person\u2019s sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression. There are 4 versions of the bill in the Senate, but none of them demand the things enumerated in the Facebook posts. (READ: EXPLAINER: What you need to know about SOGIE)\n\nThere are no provisions in the bills that say assigning sex to newborns can be penalized, or that same-sex marriage is now allowed. Insulting members of the LGBTQ+ will also not result in penalties unless they are made to ridicule and harass a person because of their SOGIE.\n\nWhat the bills propose, rather, is the equal access of the LGBTQ+ to basic rights and services. It proposes the prohibition of the following discriminatory acts if made on the basis of SOGIE:\n\nPenalties for those who commit any of the acts mentioned above range from not less than P100,000 to P500,000 and/or imprisonment of not less than 6 months to 12 years maximum, depending on the offense committed.\n\nEvery time equal rights is championed, be it for IPs, women or PWDs, oppositors are quick to take out the \u201cspecial rights\u201d card. This is dangerous. Hindi magkakalaban ang mga karapatan ng mga marhinalisadong sektor.
