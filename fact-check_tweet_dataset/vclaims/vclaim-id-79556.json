Ron Johnson, the federal government is to blame for a system that is out of whack.\n\n\"I\u2019ve got a problem where you\u2019ve got kids coming from an affluent background, taking advantage of all these student loan programs and grants for higher education and who\u2019s paying for that?\" Johnson asked at a May 28th, 2014 town hall meeting in Bristol. \"I mean, in many cases, working class families \u2013 the middle class who aren't going to college, who aren\u2019t sending their kids or they didn\u2019t go to college themselves, and yet their tax money\u2019s being used to fund the college educations of more affluent individuals.\"\n\nIs this really the case?\n\nJohnson\u2019s claim has two main parts so let\u2019s take a look at both.\n\nThe first part of Johnson\u2019s claim is that some college students who come from an \"affluent background\" take advantage of federal student loans and grants so they can afford higher education.\n\nWhen we asked Johnson for backup, his policy advisor, Patrick McIlheran, said Johnson didn\u2019t have a \"precise numerical definition\" in mind for affluent when he made the claim.\n\nInstead, Johnson meant the dictionary definition of affluent, which is \"having a generously sufficient and typically increasing supply of material possessions.\"\n\nMeanwhile, federal student aid has no formal income limits.\n\nRather, the U.S. Department of Education defines financial need as the difference between the cost of attending college and a family\u2019s expected contribution to the education. This, of course, varies by university and family.\n\nFederal student loans fall into two major categories -- subsidized and unsubsidized.\n\nFor subsidized loans, a borrower needs to prove financial need to qualify. In these loans, the Department of Education pays interest on them while the student is in college and up until six months after the borrower leaves college, according to the department\u2019s student aid website.\n\nIn contrast, unsubsidized loans are available to all students with no financial need requirement. But unsubsidized loans accrue interest while the borrower is still in school and during the six-month grace period.\n\nIn any case, the structure means the affluent students Johnson described, by and large would not be using the need-based subsidized loans.\n\nEven if those families borrow do direct unsubsidized loans, this comes at no cost to the federal government because these loans generate revenue, according to Jon Fansmith, director of government relations at the American Council on Education, which represents presidents of accredited universities and colleges.\n\nA 2008 College Board study that analyzed debt level for student loans by income and labeled \"$120,000 or higher\" as its highest income bracket.\n\nThat group accumulated the lowest amount of debt at $14,500 on average at public four-year universities and $18,000 at private, nonprofit universities.\n\nBut there is no breakdown of whether that debt involved federal student loans, or whether any such loans were subsidized or unsubsidized.\n\nIn any case, that income bracket is also the fastest growing category of student loan debt, according to an August 2012 Wall Street Journal analysis of Federal Reserve data.\n\nJohnson\u2019s claim also included grants being used by affluent students.\n\nBut the Department of Education restricts Pell Grants to those who meet income-eligibility standards, which targets them for the neediest financial aid recipients.\n\nStudents whose families earn below $20,000 annually often qualify for Pell Grants but, in some cases, those from families earning up to $50,000 can receive them.\n\nAgain, this rules out the \"affluent\" students mentioned in Johnson\u2019s claim.\n\nIn the second part of the claim, Johnson said middle class taxpayers who didn\u2019t attend college, or have any connection to college, fund \"federal loan programs and grants.\"\n\nHere it\u2019s important to understand how the student loan programs work.\n\nThe system is structured to be self-sufficient and even generate revenue. That is, the costs of administering the program are covered by loan repayments, so it\u2019s not part of the general fund budget that is picked up by average taxpayers.\n\nThe Department of Education budget draws on funds from the Treasury to shoulder the costs of subsidized loans, grants, and the repayment of some loans. This money from the Treasury is indirectly funded by taxpayers, Fansmith said.\n\nWhen loan payments are collected, those funds are then returned to the Treasury so student loans generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue annually for the federal government, Fansmith said. This actually reduces the deficit, he said, rather than costs general taxpayers anything.\n\nBut loan repayment and forgiveness programs that rely on \"general appropriations\" do affect the nation\u2019s roughly 143 million taxpayers. So that tab is shared by those who have college degrees and those who don\u2019t.\n\nThere are more than 50 repayment programs. In most cases, they are aimed at helping individuals who take jobs in specific areas, such as teaching in low-income school districts or working in particular government agencies.\n\nNewer programs, aimed at alleviating the student debt crisis, are open to more people.\n\nFor instance, the \"Pay As You Earn\" plan took effect July 1, 2014. It allows borrowers to repay their debt for up to 20 years -- twice as long as most standard repayment cycles -- and then the federal government repays their remaining debt.\n\nAs its name suggests, the PAYE plan offers lower monthly payment rates that depend on 10 percent of a borrower\u2019s income. So borrowers with higher incomes -- the more affluent -- would still pay more than others.\n\nThe Department of Education estimated the program would cost more than $2.1 billion between 2012 and 2021 but its final cost has not been determined, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nIn any case, the costs won\u2019t won\u2019t really kick in until 2017, when the U.S. Dept. of Education starts paying off the first round of borrowers\u2019 remaining debt.\n\nThe Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan policy research group, released a study in April 2014 that estimates existing repayment programs could cost the federal government four times more than the Department of Education anticipated, totaling roughly $3,400 overall per borrower.\n\nOf course, any such costs would affect the general budget and all taxpayers.\n\nJohnson said those \"coming from an affluent background\" are \"taking advantage of all these student loan programs and grants\" while many middle-class families with no connection to college are picking up the tab.\n\nIn some cases, affluent people get a subsidized loan and based on repayment programs, some small portion hits the general fund. But then it\u2019s picked by all taxpayers not simply the group Johnson mentioned -- middle class taxpayers with no ties to college.\n\nIn short, he vastly overstates the problem on both ends and makes a link that he cannot clearly establish based on available data.\n\nWe rate his claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
