It says the claim that 500 churches have been closed comes from a 2012 article in the Wall Street Journal. That article says that in 2006, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) \u201cfound that since 2001, about 500 churches in London alone had been converted into homes\u201d. That doesn\u2019t tell us when these buildings actually stopped being churches though, as they may have been empty for some time before being converted.\n\nThe Church of England says that around 20 to 25 of its \u201cchurch buildings\u201d close for worship every year.\n\nThese figures also don\u2019t tell us how many churches opened in that time. According to the most recent available data, from a census of London churches by the organisation Faith Survey in 2012, 700 new churches had opened between 2005 and 2012.\n\nThe Home Office maintains a list of places of worship registered for marriage, but this is not an exhaustive list, and doesn\u2019t cover Anglican premises.\n\nThe Gatestone Institute sources their version of this claim (that there were 423 \u201cnew\u201d mosques, when the article was written in 2017) to the website Muslims in Britain, which maintains an unofficial list of mosques in the UK. It says there are 477 mosques in London (at the time of writing). This includes Islamic cultural centres, prayer rooms, and shared spaces like halls for hire.\n\nThe claim doesn\u2019t specify when these mosques opened, and the data doesn\u2019t give details on that, but some of them have been in existence for decades.\n\nThe government said in 2016 that three government buildings, Richmond House, Wellington House and 22-26 Whitehall underpin a government-issued Islam-approved financial bond. This bond is called a Sukuk, and the government starting issuing them in 2014.\n\nThe bonds matured in July 2019 although the government has planned to issue more.\n\nThe Sukuk complies with Islamic law as it does not pay interest, and instead investors get a return from rent paid on buildings.\n\nIn response to a written question on the use of buildings underpinning Sukuks the government said: \u201cThe Sukuk is issued under, and governed by, English law. The properties underpinning the Sukuk continue to be occupied by the departments that were there before issuance, with no change to their use.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile investors have a beneficial interest in the assets, they do not have any say over how the properties are used.\u201d\n\nThere were reports at the time that this meant alcohol couldn\u2019t be consumed in the buildings. The Treasury told us that the buildings are governed by English law but had to adhere to sharia principles in order to underpin the bond. For example, the buildings wouldn\u2019t be able to profit off of the sale of alcohol or gambling.\n\nSharia law does not have any official legal or constitutional role in the UK.\n\nWe\u2019ve talked about the topic of \u201cno-go areas\u201d before. There aren\u2019t any locations in the UK or London where the rule of law does not apply.\n\nIn 2014, it was suggested by the Chief Inspector of Constabulary that in some communities from other cultures the police: \u201cnever hear of any trouble because the community deals with that on its own. It\u2019s not that the police are afraid to go into these areas or don\u2019t want to go into those areas.\u201d He doesn't specify here whether he is talking about Muslim communities in particular.\n\nIt\u2019s not immediately obvious what the image means by \u201cstreet prayers\u201d.\n\nThere have been several examples of Muslims praying outdoors in London. For example, these photos were taken in Soho. This may be because mosques can\u2019t accommodate all the worshippers at once during specific prayer times.\n\nThis is wrong, if we take violence to mean the number of homicides.\n\nA group called the Citizen Council for Public Safety and Criminal Justice, in Mexico, releases a list of annually of the most violent cities by the rate of homicides per 100,000 of the population.\n\nThe capital city that comes highest in the list is Caracas in Venezuela, it was listed as the second most violent, with 111 homicides per 100,000. South Africa has three capital cities, and one of them, Cape Town, was listed as the fifteenth most violent, with 62. Jamaica\u2019s capital, Kingston, was sixteenth with almost 60.\n\nAlthough six capital cities in total make the list, London is not one of them. London\u2019s homicide rate in 2017 was about 1.6 per 100,000. In 2018 it was 1.5.\n\nLondon\u2019s crime rates are often compared to New York (although of course, it\u2019s not a capital city), as they have similar sized populations (as of the middle of 2018, London had about 8.9 million and New York, 8.4 million). In 2018, there were 135 homicides in London and 295 in New York.\n\nAs we\u2019ve said before, the New York Police Department\u2019s definition of homicide is slightly narrower than the Metropolitan Police\u2019s.", "lang": "en"}
