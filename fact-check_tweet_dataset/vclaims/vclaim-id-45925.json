The image claims to show National Guard members that have been deployed to the nation\u2019s capital sleeping on the streets.\n\n\u201cOur troops getting a good night sleep after getting kicked out of DC hotel preparing for a million people protesting at the White House today!!!\u201d text above the image reads.

A spokesperson for the Minnesota National Guard confirmed to PolitiFact that the photo depicts some of its members resting in Minneapolis.\n\n\u201cWhile other members of the unit provided security, these soldiers grabbed a quick nap in front U.S. Bank E 2800 Lake St. in Minneapolis,\u201d Maj. Scott Hawkins, spokesperson for the Minnesota National Guard, told PolitiFact. \u201cAs more soldiers came on state activate duty orders, replacements became available to relieve them and regular 12 hour shifts were instituted. The Minnesota National Guard had plentiful sleeping arrangements within our staging areas with cots and food supplies. We were not dependent on hotel lodging.\u201d\n\nThe claim that National Guard members were kicked out of D.C. hotels appears to stem from a Twitter exchange between Republican Utah Sen. Mike Lee and Democratic D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser earlier this month.\n\n\u201cJust heard that Mayor Bowser is kicking the Utah National Guard out of all DC hotels tomorrow,\u201d Lee tweeted. \u201cMore than 1200 troops from 10 states are being evicted. This is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nBowser, however, refuted his claim in a tweet of her own.\n\n\u201cSenator \u2013 until they are recalled home \u2013 which I have formally requested from the President, your troops are in DC hotels,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cHowever, DC residents cannot pay their hotel bills. The Army can clear that up with the hotel today, and we are willing to help.\u201d\n\nUtah National Guard members had to change hotels in early June after they occupied a block of hotel rooms that were reserved for COVID-19 responders and paid for by the city, according to the Military Times. Bowser told reporters on June 5 that if National Guard units in town to monitor protests were \u201cgoing to use the rooms that we reserved, then they are going to have to pay for them, and you have to refund us our money,\u201d per ABC News.\n\nPresident Donald Trump ordered National Guard troops to withdraw from the nation\u2019s capital on June 7, WUSA reported.", "lang": "en"}
