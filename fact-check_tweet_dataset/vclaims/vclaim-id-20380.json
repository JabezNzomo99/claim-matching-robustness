Instead local authorities can force landlords to deal with serious health and safety hazards that pose risks to the people living in the property.\n\nThe government opposed a recent amendment that would have introduced such a rule for private rented properties, saying that it would add unnecessary regulation and cost to landlords, and ultimately higher rents for tenants.\n\nThere have been two attempts at putting rules ensuring that homes are fit for human habitation into legislation in recent years.\n\nIn 2015 Labour MP Karen Buck introduced the Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Bill 2015/16. Its purpose was \u201cto amend the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 to require that residential rented accommodation is provided and maintained in a state of fitness for human habitation; and for connected purposes.\u201d\n\nThe bill was \u201ctalked out\u201d meaning that it was not put to a vote and dropped.\n\nThe proposals were reintroduced in 2016 as an amendment to the Housing and Planning Bill 2015/16.\n\n219 MPs voted in favour for the amendment which would have placed \u201ca duty on landlords to ensure that their properties are fit for habitation when let and remain fit during the course of the tenancy.\u201d 312 voted against it and the amendment was defeated.\n\nThe tweet incorrectly says all 312 are Conservative MPs. Of those MPs who voted against it 309 were from the Conservative Party, one was from UKIP and two were from the Ulster Unionist Party.\n\nOf those MPs who voted for it 205 were from Labour, six were from the Liberal Democrats, two were from the Democratic Unionist Party, two were from Plaid Cymru, two were from the Social Democratic and Labour Party, one was from the Green Party and one was an independent. The SNP did not vote on the bill.\n\nBefore the vote the government said that the amendment \u201cwill result in unnecessary regulation and cost to landlords, which will deter further investment and push up rents for tenants. Of course we believe that all homes should be of a decent standard, and that all tenants should have a safe place in which to live regardless of tenure, but local authorities already have strong and effective powers to deal with poor quality and unsafe accommodation, and we expect them to use them.\u201d\n\nThere are other regulations for housing standards\n\nThe powers councils have at the moment are granted under what\u2019s called the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS). This isn\u2019t a pass or fail system of looking at a building, it judges houses, and their maintenance issues, depending on the risks they pose.\n\nThe assessment of these risks also varies depending on the type of occupants in the house and also by how the individual council interprets and enforces the rules.\n\nThe House of Commons Library says that the main arguments around introducing a minimum property standard for houses are:\n\u2022 Landlords concerns about over-regulation if more rules are introduced.\n\nThere are already \u201cimplied terms in a tenancy agreement that require landlords to let properties which are \u2018fit for human habitation\u2019\u201d under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985. However these rules only apply to people who have an annual rent of less than \u00a352 (or \u00a380 in London) and have never been updated. The House of Commons Library describes them as \u201cobsolete\u201d.\n\nThis act also sets out a landlord\u2019s responsibilities to ensure that the structure of a house or flat and its plumbing is in good repair (this does not depend on a maximum rent level).\n\nIf the state of your property affects the occupant\u2019s health then it is possible to have the council\u2019s environmental health officers look into it. The council can then compel the landlord to conduct the necessary repairs (if they are a private landlord or housing association). Those living in council houses can seek an independent assessment.\n\nThere are also specific pieces of legislation which focus on a landlord\u2019s responsibilities to ensure that gas appliances are maintained, that smoke and carbon monoxide alarms are installed and that tenants are protected from harmful things such as legionella.", "lang": "en"}
