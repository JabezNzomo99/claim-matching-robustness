One such image supposedly showed a flock of flamingos crowding a canal in Venice, Italy:\n\nThis is not a genuine photograph. Although flamingos can be found in Italy, the above-displayed image is a digital artwork imagining flamingos swimming in the famous canals of Venice.\n\nThis image was created by Kristina Makeeva, a digital artist who goes by the handle @hobopeeba on Instagram. This image was posted to that Instagram page on April 24, 2020, along with a caption identifying the image as \u201cart.\u201d\n\nMakeeva wrote: \u201cArt 2020 \u25aa\ufe0f when people stay at home \u2013 city is filled with other residents.\u201d\n\nWhile Makeeva labeled this image as \u201cArt,\u201d many people who viewed the image on Instagram were still curious if this was a real photograph. Makeeva responded to many of these commentators and informed them that \u201cno,\u201d this was not a real photograph:\n\nThe Instagram page for @Hobopeeba is full of similarly fantastical images. The biography for this page also notes that Makeeva is a \u201cPhotographer & cat & engineer-wizard from Moscow\u201d and a \u201cModern converter from ordinary to magic.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, this image went viral as a similar, but real, scene played out in Mumbai. In mid-April 2020, an estimated 150,000 flamingos were spotted off the coast of Mumbai.\n\nAs people around the world stay inside to fight the spread of coronavirus, wild animals have begun to enjoy the newfound space. That appears to be what\u2019s happened in the metropolitan region of Mumbai, India, where a record-breaking number of flamingos have migrated, painting the wetlands pink, according to local reports. The Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) estimates that around 25% more flamingos have migrated to the region compared to last year, likely caused by the decrease in human activity, the Hindustan Times reports. The Science Times calculates around 150,000 flamingos have come to the area.\n\nHere\u2019s a photograph from Getty Images showing this large flock of flamingos in India:", "lang": "en"}
