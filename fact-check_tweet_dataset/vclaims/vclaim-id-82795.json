The court ruled 5 to 4 that, as a closely-held company, Hobby Lobby was not required to pay for all of the birth-control procedures mandated by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBefore the ACA became law, Hobby Lobby actually had provided coverage for all 20 FDA-approved contraceptive procedures required under the law. But once it became a mandate, the owners decided to object to four on religious grounds: Two \u201cmorning after\u201d emergency contraceptive pills, Plan B and ella, and hormonal and copper intrauterine devices (IUDs). Founder David Green told the Wall Street Journal he was \u201cshocked\u201d to discover his plan covered these procedures.\n\n\u201cThe Green family has no moral objection to the use of 16 of 20 preventive contraceptives required in the mandate, and Hobby Lobby will continue its longstanding practice of covering these preventive contraceptives for its employees,\u201d says a Web site on the case maintained by The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which helped bring the lawsuit. \u201cCovering these [morning-after] drugs and [IUD] devices would violate their deeply held religious belief that life begins at the moment of conception, when an egg is fertilized.\u201d\n\nBut there is another wrinkle. The court did not rule on whether a closely-held company could object to all forms of contraception on religious grounds. That still needs to be litigated at the lower courts in light of this decision. The Daily Beast counts 82 companies, nonprofit groups and universities that have challenged the contraceptive mandate. Moreover, some closely-held companies are rather large, with tens of thousands of employees.\n\nIn other words, while Clinton\u2019s specific reference to Hobby Lobby was inaccurate, the ruling has left unclear whether some employers could institute a broader ban on paying for all contraception. So her statement of concern was not completely off base.\n\nAs for \u201cexpensive,\u201d this is in the eye of the beholder. Studies have indicated that when times are tough, women have tried to save money by skimping on birth control, such as skipping pills and delaying prescription refills. (Mea culpa: an earlier version of this paragraph rendered Clinton\u2019s quote of \u201cpretty expensive\u201d as \u201cvery expensive.\u201d)\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, in her dissent, noted that in the case of IUDs, the devices are \u201csignificantly more effective, and significantly more expensive than other contraceptive devices.\u201d She cited a cost of $1,000 for the office visit and insertion procedure \u2014 \u201cnearly the equivalent to a month\u2019s full-time pay for workers earning the minimum wage.\u201d\n\nUpdate: Some readers have objected to this analysis on the grounds that some women cannot use hormonal contraceptives and thus a copper IUD may be the only safe and reliable form of contraceptive that they can use. Thus, they argue that Clinton could be talking about a salesclerk who faces this particular situation. This is an interesting parsing of her remarks, but given that Clinton\u2019s spokesman choose not to explain her comments, we cannot assume this to be the case. Generally we find that when politicians choose not to explain their remarks, it is because they made a mistake.\n\nClinton, who was speaking extemporaneously, should have been more careful in making sweeping statements about the contraceptive coverage at Hobby Lobby. It\u2019s unclear how knowledgeable she was about the details of the decision; host Walter Issacson was a bit sweeping in his description as well.\n\nIn the specific case, the company on religious grounds objected to four of 20 possible options, leaving other possible types of contraceptives available to female employees \u2014 though not necessarily the most effective or necessary at the moment. It remains to be seen whether the lower courts will interpret the ruling as allowing some companies to institute a broader ban on coverage, so Clinton was leaping to an assumption about the impact on employees.", "lang": "en"}
