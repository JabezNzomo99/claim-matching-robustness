The claim is false, the footage actually shows members of an extortion gang in Faridabad.\n\nThe 36-second video shows three men attacking another man with sticks. It has been shared repeatedly on Facebook, for example here on March 24, 2019, where it has been viewed more than 5,000 times.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption says: \u201c#Haryana, : #Gurgaon BJP workers beating muslim and asking go to Pakistan\u201d. Gurgaon refers to a city in the north Indian state of Haryana.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of one of the misleading Facebook posts:\n\nThe clip has been shared elsewhere on Facebook with the same claim here and on YouTube here.\n\nThe video actually shows an incident in Faridabad, another city about 30 kilometres (18 miles) from Gurgaon.\n\nA Google reverse image search using keyframes from the misleading video found that screenshots of the footage appeared in this March 14, 2019 report on Hindi-language news website Amarujala.\n\nThe report quotes a senior police officer, Anil Kumar, who says the men seen in the video footage are members of what he calls a \"fracture gang\".\n\n\u201cOn February 17, 2019, they thrashed Sanju mercilessly with an iron rod in Faridabad, a town near Delhi and recorded his video and shared it. Since then police were on a lookout for the gang,\u201d Kumar said in the Amarujala report, adding that three people were arrested March 12, 2019, in Faridabad.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the news report:\n\nThe report\u2019s headline says: \u201cThey used to take contracts to break limbs and would record it, they\u2019re called the \u2018fracture gang\u2019 inspired by a movie.\u201d\n\nThe text above the first image says: \u201cPolice arrested three men, including the suspected kingpin of the so-called \u2018fracture gang\u2019 who, inspired by (Bollywood actor) Sanjay Dutt movie Vaastav (The Reality), carried out brutal attacks in Delhi and the surrounding area.\n\n\"In the film, gangsters sought revenge on their enemies by breaking their legs. They also filmed the attacks in order to instill fear in their enemies or prove they had carried out the assault.\u201d\n\nThe report says the video was filmed in Faridabad.\n\nSections of the video were also broadcast in this report by local Hindi news channel Delhi Darpan TV, published to its YouTube account on March 14, 2019.\n\nA blurred version of the clip appears between 0:40 and 1:09 in the Delhi Darpan video embedded below:\n\nHere is a screenshot comparison showing the video in the misleading Facebook post (l) with the corresponding section in the Delhi Darpan TV YouTube video (r):\n\nThe channel also interviewed police officer Anil Kumar about the video.\n\nIn the report, he tells the news channel three assailants \u201cDeepak, Ankit and Kulbhushan\u201d were members of a \u201cfracture gang\u201d who attacked their victim and recorded a video, which was then circulated widely on social media as part of the extortion scheme.\n\nOfficial police complaints have been lodged against the three accused men and can be seen here on the police website: Deepak, Ankit and Kulbhushan.\n\nThe complaints, filed on March 13, 2019, relate to an alleged attack in Faridabad on March 12.\n\nIn the police complaints, the three men have been booked under the Indian arms act of 1959 for possession of illegal weapons and violence stemming from their use.\n\nOn March 28, 2019, a reporter in AFP\u2019s Delhi bureau telephoned the Bhupani Police Station in Faridabad where the complaint was filed.\n\nSenior police officer Abdul Sahid told AFP by phone: \u201cThe fracture gang members did not have any political connections.\n\n\u201cThe person caught on camera who was being beaten by fracture gang members was not a Muslim. He was a Hindu,\u201d Sahid added.", "lang": "en"}
