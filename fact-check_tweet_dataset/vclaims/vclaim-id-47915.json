The latter were arrested on charges that they schemed to illegally funnel foreign cash into Trump\u2019s election campaign.\n\n \n\n The two men standing between Ivanka and Eric Trump are not Parnas and Fruman. The picture shows the Trumps, who ran a real estate empire before Donald Trump became president, standing with people associated with their business enterprise in Florida. The man standing immediately to Ivanka\u2019s left is real estate developer Michael Dezer. The man on Dezer\u2019s left (and Eric\u2019s right) is Michael Babel, according to historian Yuri Felshtinsky, while the woman in the photograph standing on Ivanka\u2019s right was Florida realtor Elena Baronoff, who died in 2015 from cancer. Neither Parnas nor Fruman are in the shot. (Donald Trump Jr., is pictured to the far right in the photograph).\n\nParnas and Fruman were arrested on Oct. 9, 2019, at Dulles International Airport, where they had planned to board planes with one-way tickets out of the United States. The above meme appears to be a low-effort attempt to create the visual impression of close ties between the men and the Trumps, although actual photographs and reports do exist of interactions between Parnas, Fruman, and members of the Trump family, including Donald Trump himself.\n\n\n\n The two men, described as \u201cassociates\u201d of Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, have since 2018 \u201cbeen assisting Giuliani\u2019s push to get Ukrainian officials to investigate [Democratic presidential candidate Joe] Biden and his son, as well as Giuliani\u2019s claim that Democrats conspired with Ukrainians in the 2016 campaign.\u201d As The Washington Post reported:\n\nPresident Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry led by House Democrats over whistleblower allegations that he used his office to coerce Ukraine into providing damaging information on a political opponent by withholding crucial military aid.", "lang": "en"}
