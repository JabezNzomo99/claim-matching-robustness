{"title": "Russian Embassy Distorts Story About Anti-Vaccine Disinformation", "subtitle": "The article did not say that Russia is against vaccinations. It said that Russian trolls had spread anti-vaccine disinformation on Western social media.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "November 06, 2018", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-11488", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-distorts-anti-vaccine-disinformation/29584117.html", "vclaim": "On November 5, the Twitter account of the Russian Embassy in Britain tweeted a photo of an article by newspaper columnist Clare Foges, published in the British newspaper \"The Times.\" The subject of the article was the public health risk posed by children who are unvaccinated. The article explained that the anti-vaccine movement grew as a result of propaganda distributed via the internet, and noted that researchers found Russian trolls had also helped spread anti-vaccine propaganda in the West.\n\nThe Russian embassy Twitter feed characterized \"The Times\" article as telling readers that Russia is anti-vaccine, and said this is inaccurate because child vaccination is required by law in Russia. The author did not say or imply that Russia is anti-vaccine.So, Russian law is irrelevant in this instance.\n\nIn The Times article, Foges quoted Britain\u2019s Chief Medical Officer Professor Dame Sally Davies, who blames the falling numbers of vaccinated children on \u201csocial media fake news.\u201d Foges herself wrote that Facebook and Twitter are \u201cawash with misinformation about MMR\u201d -- the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella vaccine blamed by anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists for causing autism in children (a claim that has been resolutely debunked by the scientific community).\n\nThe author noted that this home-grown misinformation has been amplified by some Russian troll accounts.\n\n\u201cThese conspiracy theorists are being aided \u2014 and whipped up \u2014 by the Russians, who, as we know, cannot see a pie without sticking a finger in it,\u201d Foges wrote. \u201cKremlin-sponsored social media accounts have spread discredited theories about the jab, including one claim that vaccinations left three quarters of the children in a Mexican village either dead or in hospital.\u201d\n\nNowhere in the article did Foges suggest that Russia, itself, is anti-vaccine. In fact, research shows that the topic of vaccines was pushed in Western countries by some Russian-linked social media accounts and that these Russia-linked accounts spread vaccine-related information from both pro- and anti-vaccine perspectives.\n\nOne of the anti-vaccine tweets cited by \"The Guardian\" newspaper read: \u201cDid you know there was secret government database of #Vaccine-damaged child? #VaccinateUS.\u201d\n\nThe anti-vaccine issue follows the script of Russian disinformation seen by researchers in other issues. In the 2016 U.S. election, the \u201caim was to delegitimize the US political process by amplifying polarized views through social media accounts,\u201d according to an Atlantic Council report on Russian interference in elections.\n\nThe issue also fits rather neatly in the promotion of conspiracy theories, an element of Russian disinformation noted among experts, and considered common in the anti-vaccine movement.\n\nIn this instance, Russia\u2019s own laws on vaccinations are irrelevant: Russia-linked social media accounts have been known to promote a number of topics in the West which are illegal in Russia, such as calls for separatism, or secession, and autonomy.", "lang": "en"}
