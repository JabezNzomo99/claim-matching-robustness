Kelly visit Bill Cosby in prison for advice? No, that's not true: the story was made up by a \"fauxtire\" site for entertainment purposes. It is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Huzlers on January 9, 2019 titled \"R. Kelly Visits Bill Cosby In Prison for Advice\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nPennsylvania Dept. of Corrections - Reporters have confirmed that R. Kelly visited Bill Cosby shortly after the release of the lifetime documentary, \"Surviving R. Kelly.\" The documentary exposes R. Kelly as a predator and sexual abuser. \"It was just the tip, you know?\" he explained to Cosby.\n\nR. Kelly has been under fire recently after a documentary aired with abuse allegations made against him:\n\nBill Cosby was convicted of sexual assault last year, so he could probably give R. Kelly some tips (although we are not sure if they would help him much):\n\nBut Huzlers styles itself as a \"fauxtire\" website and carries a disclaimer at the bottom of each page:\n\nAccording to Splinter News the site is run by Pablo Reyes and David Martinez and according to Buzzfeed Reyes is involved with several other fake news websites. They tend to shy away from political stories, opting instead to write for a more \"urban\" audience, with stories about rappers, criminals and celebrities.\n\nWe wrote about huzlers.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Texas Man Did NOT Crash After Attempting To Drive Blindfolded Doing 'Bird Box' Challenge\n\u2022 Fake News: Man Doing 'Bird Box Challenge' Did NOT Get Jumped And Mugged In Hood\n\u2022 Fake News: Man NOT Hospitalized After His Apple Airpods Exploded In His Ear\n\u2022 Fake News: Judge Did NOT Order Premium Snapchat Model to Pay $60k in Taxes to IRS After Multiple Reports by Internet Users\n\u2022 Fake News: Florida's 'Neck Guy' Did NOT Undergo Plastic Surgery To Decrease Neck Size", "lang": "en"}
