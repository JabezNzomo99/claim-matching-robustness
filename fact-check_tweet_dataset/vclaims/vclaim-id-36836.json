The broadcast was anchored by journalist Rahul Kanwal.\n\nSince January 12, a 20-second clip of Kanwal began circulating on social media with a claim that he said chanting \u2018Vande Mataram\u2019 is anti-national. BJP\u2019s Mumbai spokesperson Suresh Nakhua posted the video with the message, \u201cSo, @rahulkanwal of @IndiaToday says \u201d Chanting Vande Mataram is anti national\u201d. Now let\u2019s see how Rahul spins this one.\u201d At the time of writing this article, Nakhua\u2019s tweet garnered over 6,500 retweets.\n\nInterestingly, Nakhua had tweeted the same clip in February 2016 with a similar narrative. At the time, the tweet had gathered close to 120 retweets.\n\nNational media in-charge of J&K BJP youth wing BJYM Rohit Chahal posted the same video with the message, \u201cAccording to @rahulkanwal singing Vande Mataram is Anti National activity ! #RahulKanwalExposed\u201d.\n\nSaurabh Khamar, a member with BJP Andhra\u2019s social media & IT cell, who flaunts a profile picture with PM Modi, tweeted a video of crowding chanting Vande Mataram and took a jibe at Kanwal. \u201cCan we file anti nationals charge sheets on this 30k People @rahulkanwal ???\u201d, reads his tweet.\n\nRahul Kanwal responded to the viral claim via a tweet. \u201cHere\u2019s what happened. @indiatoday SIT exposed lawyers who accepted on camera they bashed up Kanhaiya in court while cops watched. Lawyers attacking Kanhaiya chanted Vande Mataram. To attack someone and chant Vande Mataram is anti-national. Said it then, will say it now. Jai Hind,\u201d the journalist wrote.\n\nWith a relevant keyword search on India Today\u2019s YouTube channel, Alt News found that the viral video is part of a February 17, 2016 broadcast. \u201cGroups of unruly lawyers yet again displayed hooliganism outside the Patiala Court, attacking Kanhaiya Kumar as the JNUSU president was brought in,\u201d reads its description.\n\nKanwal was moderating a discussion where advocate Rajeev Yadav was one of the guests. In 2016, when the top court was hearing the JNU sedition row, Yadav shouted \u2018Vande Mataram\u2019 inside the courtroom and was chided by the bench. The lawyer was escorted out by security officials and had to submit an unconditional apology before the Supreme Court for his actions.\n\nDuring the India Today debate, Yadav defended his sloganeering. He believed that the lawyers defending former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar were representing a \u201ctraitor\u201d, to which Kanwal responded, \u201cBut for this reason, there are judges. A judge will decide which issue is right, which lawyer is wrong. You are arguing that in the court. You argue with Prashant Bhushan in the court. Why are you raising slogans like this? Why are you are doing the anti-national activity? Why are you doing the anti-legal activity? I allege that what you did is anti-national. The slogans of Vande Mataram, you raised, is anti-national activity.\u201d\n\nKanwal\u2019s reply to Yadav\u2019s argument that chanting Vande Mataram is not anti-national was, \u201cto raise [slogans] inside the court, is to spoil the dignity of the Supreme Court. It\u2019s totally wrong. It hurts the dignity of this country. Your act is wrong.\u201d\n\nA 20-second bit from the complete discussion was clipped to take out the context and portray Rahul Kanwal as against the slogan of \u2018Vande Mataram\u2019 when in fact he was suggesting that sloganeering inside a courtroom is unacceptable.\n\nSwarajya columnist Shefali Vaidya and former Shiv Sena member Ramesh Solanki also tweeted the clip with the false narrative. Their tweets have garnered a combined retweet count of nearly 3,600.\n\nIAS officer Sanjay Dixit also quote-tweeted the same video and opined, \u201cRahul Uvach: @rahulkanwal loftily declares Vande Mataram to be anti-National. In Khilafat 1.0, even Muslim leadership regarded it as national, but 100 years down the line, the \u2018sickular\u2019 media finds it anti-National. Khilafat 2.0 is being led by such disgusting specimens!\u201d.\n\nMany other people on Facebook and Twitter have shared the clipped video.\n\nIt may be reiterated that journalist Rahul Kanwal did not say that chanting \u2018Vande Mataram\u2019 is anti-national but sloganeering in the court of law is anti-national and anti-legal.", "lang": "en"}
