A release with the letterhead of Saint Luke\u2019s Hospital in Kansas City, USA, is going viral on social media. It claims that consuming alcohol may help reduce the risk of a Covid-19 infection, and that vodka is \"the most recommended\" substance for \"drinking, cleaning and sanitising\".\n\nIndia Today's Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that Saint Luke's Hospital hasn't released any such advisory and that the viral post is false.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nThe Facebook page, 'After Drinking Confessions' shared the advisory, dated March 7, 2020, which states: \"After extensive research, our findings show that consuming alcoholic beverages may help reduce the risk of infection by the novel coronavirus; Covid-19. Vodka is the most recommended for drinking, cleaning and sanitizing.\"\n\nBut we found a Facebook post from the hospital (Saint Luke's Health System/@saintlukeskc) saying that the report circulating on social media is false and that it is following guidlines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nCAN VODKA BE USED AS A HAND SANITISER?\n\nThere are multiple recipes showing netizens how to make their own sanitiser using vodka, including one from Tito\u2019s Handmade Vodka.\n\nBut Tito\u2019s Vodka has asked the public not to use their product to make hand sanitiser as the CDC says sanitiser needs to contain at least 60% alcohol.\n\nIndiaToday.in has plenty of resources to help you better understand the coronavirus outbreak and take necessary precautions.
