Kofi Adomah invited by CID for predicting the President\u2019s address correctly.\u201d\n\nThe 21 minutes long video was posted by YouTube Channel Bigscout Media and has social media commentator Nana Prempeh sharing his perspective on the situation.\n\nBut nowhere in the video which has since racked up 11,962 views does Nana Prempeh confirm or provide details on the alleged detention of journalist Kofi Adomah as claimed in the headline.\n\n\u201cI was just invited; I was not put behind bars. Not at all.\u201d Journalist Kofi Adomah told GhanaFact.\n\nMeanwhile, efforts to reach the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) of the Ghana Police Service for a reaction proved futile. GhanaFact will duly update the report if there is a new development.\n\nThe headline of the video is rated false.", "lang": "en"}
