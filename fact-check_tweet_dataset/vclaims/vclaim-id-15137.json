Also, people started comparing him with the role played by actor Vijay in the Tamil movie \u2018Sarkar\u2019, wherein the hero travels from abroad to cast his vote in India. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nFact: Sundar Pichai is a US citizen, so he cannot vote in the Indian elections. The photo in the post was taken in 2017 when Pichai visited IIT Kharagpur. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image in the post was run through Google Reverse Image Search, it is found that the picture has been tweeted by Pichai himself on his Twitter account. It was during his visit to IIT-Kharagpur (his alma mater) in 2017. So, the picture in the post is an old photo taken two years back.\n\nAlso, Sundar Pichai has become an American citizen, so he cannot vote in the Indian Elections.\n\nFinally, Sundar Pichai did not cast his vote in the Indian Elections-2019.", "lang": "en"}
