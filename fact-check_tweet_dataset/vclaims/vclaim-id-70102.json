The Times\u2019 resulting article noted that the president had \u201cstrained lately to define what his second-term agenda would be\u201d and quoted him as uttering the words reproduced in the above meme, but it also referenced Trump\u2019s offering \u201ca list of what he has done and would continue to do,\u201d so the president did in fact provide some specifics about what he had, and wanted to, accomplish:\n\nBeyond more of the same, [Trump] has strained lately to define what his second-term agenda would be. Asked at various points, even by friendly interviewers on Fox News, he has offered meandering answers. His fellow Republicans seem no more certain. They therefore dispensed with a party platform altogether, opting instead for a simple resolution of loyalty to the president. In the interview, Mr. Trump rattled off a list of what he has done and would continue to do, like increasing military spending, cutting taxes, eliminating regulations, reinforcing the border and appointing conservative judges. \u201cBut so I think, I think it would be, I think it would be very, very, I think we\u2019d have a very, very solid, we would continue what we\u2019re doing, we\u2019d solidify what we\u2019ve done, and we have other things on our plate that we want to get done,\u201d he said.", "lang": "en"}
