It shows video clips of Kasich apparently confirming the ad\u2019s arguments. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make the Pentagon a triangle. I\u2019m thrilled,\u201d Kasich says in one clip. Then it cuts to another clip of Kasich saying: \u201cI spent a whole career trying to rein in defense spending.\u201d\n\nFirst, some important context: Right to Rise attacks Kasich over budget battles of two decades ago, which was a completely different time. The two amendments the ad refers to are from 1993 and 1994, when Republicans and Democrats sought to rein in Cold War levels of defense spending for what they believed to be right-sizing the defense budget.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that while this pro-Bush group criticizes defense cuts, efforts to reduce military spending actually began in 1990 under George H.W. Bush, Jeb Bush\u2019s father, as The Fact Checker found in 2011. Indeed, the defense budget was under constant pressure in the 1990s and did not start climbing again until after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks; Kasich left Congress nine months before those terrorist attacks dramatically changed the calculus on the defense budget.\n\nKasich was elected to the House in the early 1980s under a Democrat-controlled Congress. Democrats remained in the majority until 1995, when Republicans gained control of both chambers for the first time in 40 years. In 1993 and 1994, Kasich supported some of the efforts to reduce the Pentagon\u2019s overhead. But President Clinton consistently rejected efforts to cut federal spending.\n\nIn 1993, the Defense Department had highlighted low-priority items that Congress could reallocate to higher-priority needs. Instead, the House Appropriations defense subcommittee allocated another $1.2 billion for the high-priority needs. Then-Rep. Thomas H. Andrews (D-Maine) introduced an amendment to eliminate the $1.2 billion, saying the Pentagon should not have deficit spending privileges without being asked to cut spending from existing programs.\n\nKasich supported this amendment, which the ad cited for the \u201cmassive defense cuts\u201d claim. But let\u2019s keep this figure in context. This was additional spending that had been requested \u2014 and the defense budget in 1993 was about $290 billion. So these aren\u2019t \u201cmassive cuts,\u201d but more like a rounding error.\n\nMatt Wall of Right to Rise USA said: \u201cClinton and others warned that irrespective of the added language, the cuts were so severe that they would inevitably harm defense. In other words, and per the ad, Kasich wanted cuts so severe that even Bill Clinton said they would harm defense.\u201d\n\nThings changed in 1995. Republicans took control of Congress for the first time in 40 years. Kasich became House Budget Committee chairman and his mentor, Newt Gingrich, became speaker of the House. Together with their allies, they became known as \u201cdeficit hawks\u201d who became the key players of writing the 1997 Balanced Budget Act and getting it passed into law. (Gingrich has called on Right to Rise USA to pull the ad.)\n\nThe day after the November 1994 election, Clinton said: \u201cI will do everything in my power to reach out to the leaders and the members of this new Congress. It must be possible to make it a more effective, more functioning institution. It must be possible for us to give our people a government that is smaller, that is more effective, that reflects both our interests and our values.\u201d\n\nMichael O\u2019Hanlon, defense policy expert at the Brookings Institution who testified before Congress during the defense budget deliberations at the time, told us the main thing Kasich did was \u201cto rein in the GOP after the 1994 Gingrich revolution on the subject of the desire for more defense spending. That\u2019s when he and Gingrich established themselves as \u2018cheap hawks.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Kasich was thoughtful and responsible on his defense positions, even if one could debate whether defense spending was being cut slightly too much then,\u201d O\u2019Hanlon added. \u201cOf course, it was only half a decade after the Cold War ended \u2014 so of course defense spending was going to be \u2018historically low.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe ad uses Kasich\u2019s own words that he \u201cspent a whole career trying to rein in defense spending,\u201d and that he was \u201cthrilled\u201d to cut the Pentagon\u2019s budget. Yes, Kasich did work to downsize federal defense spending. But the two specific votes that the ad cites don\u2019t support the message that Kasich was \u201cdangerously wrong\u201d on national security or that he supported cuts that would\u2019ve jeopardized defense operations.\n\nKasich rejected $1.2 billion in supplementary funding for the Defense Department, as the ad claims. But that was additional spending that House defense appropriators decided to give without making the cuts the Defense Department was willing to accept for low-priority items. Kasich did support an amendment to reduce spending that Clinton claimed would harm defense. But Clinton argued that even though the Penny-Kasich proposal specifically added legislative language to shield defense spending.", "lang": "en"}
