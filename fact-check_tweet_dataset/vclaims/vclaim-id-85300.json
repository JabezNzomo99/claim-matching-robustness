Journalist Aditya Raj Kaul shared the trailer and tweeted, \u201cIn tears. I am unable to move. For the first time someone has had the courage to narrate my story of forced exodus by Islamist terrorists in Kashmir without monkey balancing. Thank you @rahulpandita for writing this for us all. Thank you @VVCFilms for sharing this brutal truth.\u201d\n\nSince January 8, several social media users shared a screenshot of Shehla Rashid allegedly quote-tweeting Kaul\u2019s tweet and asking people to boycott the movie. \u201cPlese boycott this anti Kashmiri Muslim movie Shikara. There is no need to bring up the past\u2026What is bygone is bygone\u2026\u201d reads the purported tweet.\n\nFacebook page Puffington Post shared the viral screenshot and wrote, \u201cOhh yes. Same reason we shouldn\u2019t talk about 2002 again.\u201d This post has been shared over 180 times.\n\nOn January 10, Twitter user @rohinikaul posted two screenshots and said, \u201c@Shehla_Rashid is this tweet shared by you? I couldn\u2019t find it. If it is then it pains me to see this.I have been pretty vocal about how two wrongs can\u2019t make one right being a Kashmiri pandit.(screenshot) But why boycott a movie which is on our history? Aren\u2019t we all against d terrorists? #Shikara\u201d\n\nHere, instead of Kaul, Rashid is allegedly quote-tweeting one Rohit Arya.\n\nSeveral social media users have shared viral screenshots on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nThe alleged tweet could not be located on Shehla Rashid\u2019s Twitter timeline, hinting that it was either deleted or was never made in the first place.\n\nAlt News picked up a random quote-tweet by Rashid (right) and compared it with the screenshot shared by Puffington Post (left). It is noticeable that both the viral images show different text alignments.\n\u2022 The quote-tweet is perfectly aligned \u2013 Rashid\u2019s profile picture, the text and Kaul\u2019s tweet do not cross the red line.\n\u2022 In the screenshot, the red line also crosses over Rashid\u2019s profile picture\n\u2022 A part of Kaul\u2019s tweet also crosses over the red line in the screenshot.\n\u2022 The quote-tweet carries a time-stamp which is missing from the screenshot.\n\nThe screenshot shared by @rashmi21044 has similar alignment issues. Moreover, Arya\u2019s tweet looks like a Facebook post as the \u2018public\u2019 and the \u2018send friend request\u2019 icons are visible.\n\nSpeaking with Alt News Rashid said, \u201cThis seems like a very mischievous attempt to incite communal tensions. I\u2019m shocked by the deliberateness with which this screenshot has been doctored. I didn\u2019t know about the movie till last night when this fake screenshot came to my notice. Kashmiri Pandits are part of Kashmir, and it is ridiculous to suggest that I would call for a boycott of a movie or a book by a Kashmiri Pandit.\u201d\n\nThe claim on social media that Shehla Rashid asked people to boycott \u2018Shikara \u2013 The Untold Story of Kashmiri Pandits\u2019 is false and was made using a doctored screenshot of a tweet that the activist never made. Earlier, former BJP MLA Paresh Rawal had targetted Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in a similar fashion.", "lang": "en"}
