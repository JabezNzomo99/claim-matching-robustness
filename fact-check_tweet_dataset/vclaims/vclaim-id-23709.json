The UK has an opt-out from this.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-23709", "url": "https://fullfact.org/europe/uk-wont-have-adopt-euro-2020/", "vclaim": "The UK won\u2019t have to adopt the Euro by 2020\n\nThe claim that all EU member states have to join the Euro by either 2020 or 2022 is inaccurate, and we\u2019ve written about this before. The claim seems to originate from a 2014 opinion piece in the Telegraph which predicted EU member nations would have to adopt the Euro by 2020.\n\nAt the moment, 19 of the 28 EU members are part of the \u2018Euro area\u2019. Both the UK and Denmark have \u201copt-outs\u201d to joining. The UK\u2019s opt-out, which says that the UK \u201cshall be under no obligation\u201d to adopt the Euro, is explicitly referenced in the Lisbon Treaty.\n\nThe treaty does reference the ultimate goal of \u201cthe euro becoming the currency of all Member States of the Union\u201d, but that doesn\u2019t override the UK\u2019s opt out, and it does not set a time limit on that goal.\n\nThe seven EU member states that do not currently use the Euro, and do not have an opt-out, are expected to join the Euro, but only when they meet certain conditions. These criteria include: inflation (the way prices change over time) and long-term interest rates in that country must be within a certain distance of the three \u201cbest performing\u201d countries in the EU, public finances must be \u201csound and sustainable\u201d, exchange rates must be stable. The Lisbon Treaty says that countries not meeting these requirements will not have to adopt the euro.", "lang": "en"}
