On searching for the video on Facebook with the keywords \u201c\u0926\u093f\u0932\u094d\u0932\u0940 \u0928\u092e\u093e\u091c \u0915\u093e\u0928\u0942\u0928\u201d, we came across a slightly longer version of the same video posted on the platform by a page called Arjun Kr. Singh on 21 March.\n\nAn archived version of this post can be seen here. In this longer version, one can hear the unseen speaker in the video saying that the date of the video recording is the 20th, ostensibly 20 March, since the video was uploaded on 21 March. Therefore, this makes it clear that this namaz offering took place before the lockdown was imposed and is not from now.", "lang": "en"}
