Neither claim was correct.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2018-10-13T21:40:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-33356", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/craigslist-ad-linestanders-trump-rally/", "vclaim": "President Trump is known for boasting about the size of the crowds at his rallies, sometimes exaggerating the number of people in attendance, according to press reports.\n\nTrump has also accused Democrats of hiring paid protesters to disrupt Congressional hearings, albeit without any evidence to prove it.\n\nSo, when a Craigslist ad appeared the day before a 10 October 2018 event in Erie, Pennsylvania, soliciting \u201cnumerous people to stand in line to get into [the] Trump rally,\u201d anti-Trump social media users were all over it:\n\nTrump supporters responded to the claim that the ad proved Trump was paying people to attend his rally by floating a theory on Reddit that the ad was fake. They noted that Craigslist had deleted the ad after it was flagged (although it was restored intact later the same day), and pointed to a contact phone number in the ad not traceable to Trump nor to any Trump-related organizations, but rather to a man named Mike Oles, who appeared to have connections to left-leaning activist groups including one called Good Jobs Nation.\n\nOles\u2019 personal Facebook page lists him as a field director for that organization, whose mission statement says they are out \u201cto hold the president and all politicians \u2014 whether Democrat or Republican \u2014 accountable to America\u2019s workers.\u201d\n\nAnd it just so happened that Good Jobs Nation was planning a demonstration at Trump\u2019s 10 October rally:\n\nWe dialed the contact number in the Craigslist ad hoping to reach Mike Oles (or any party willing to claim responsibility for the ad), only to encounter a generic voicemail greeting. We left a message, but no one called back. We also e-mailed the contact address provided in the Craigslist ad. We received no reply.\n\nWe then e-mailed Good Jobs Nation and asked to be put in touch with Mike Oles, prompting a response from the organization\u2019s communications director, Paco Fabian, who agreed to speak to us by phone. He began by confirming that Oles had indeed placed the ad and that Oles did so on behalf of Good Jobs Nation, but Fabian said the ad was neither fake nor intended to mislead.\n\n\u201cGood Jobs Nation has been doing a tour around the Midwest,\u201d Fabian explained, \u201cgoing to Trump rallies with laid-off workers and retirees and other folks that are calling on President Trump to stop the off-shoring of jobs and make sure that companies with huge federal contracts pay their workers a living wage.\u201d\n\nSome of the participants were retired Honeywell workers who lack healthcare coverage because the company failed to make good on its promise of lifetime benefits, he said.\n\n\u201cSo, in Erie, we put up an ad on Craigslist looking for people to stand in line so the Honeywell retirees wouldn\u2019t have to stand in line for eight hours before being able to go into the Trump rally,\u201d Fabian said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty common practice.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Ellwood City Ledger, thousands of people spent much of the day waiting in line to get into the Erie Insurance Arena where the rally took place. Fabian said his organization paid between 12 and 15 people $100 apiece to hold spots so the same number of workers and retirees, all wearing \u201cGood Jobs Nation\u201d t-shirts, could attend \u2014 albeit not for long.\n\n\u201cUltimately, we were all kicked out,\u201d Fabian said. Their t-shirts gave them away. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been disruptive or anything. We haven\u2019t been yelling at the president. But we do tell our stories to the press. I think they finally had it with us going to the rallies.\u201d\n\nIn any case, local press reports said the 9,000-seat venue was filled to capacity for the event (no exaggeration required).", "lang": "en"}
