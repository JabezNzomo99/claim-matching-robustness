As part of our running feature on those repeats, \u201cGroundhog Friday,\u201d we note here some of the misleading talking points we heard this week. It is by no means an exhaustive list. Follow the links to our original stories for more on each claim.\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on GOP nominee Donald Trump\u2019s comments about wages, Oct. 10 rally in Detroit: \u201cSo, if people \u2014 if people aren\u2019t worried about the fact he pays no income tax and if they\u2019re not worried about how he\u2019s misled people about where he gets his steel, point out to them that he actually stood on a debate stage during the Republican primaries and said, \u2018Wages in America are too high.\u2019 You know, I love it. He keeps denying these things. And he must forget that we do have video and audio in 2016 and you can actually pull it out again and show people.\u201d\n\nThis Democratic talking point has been around since at least the Democratic National Convention in July, when we first wrote about it when it was used by Sens. Bob Casey and Kirsten Gillibrand. It has been repeated by others, including Vice President Joe Biden, since then.\n\nTrump did use the phase \u201cwages too high\u201d at a Nov. 10, 2015, GOP debate, as Clinton said. But Trump made his remark when he was asked about raising the federal minimum wage to $15. He said he was opposed to raising the minimum wage; he did not say that the overall wages are currently too high.\n\n\u201c[T]axes too high, wages too high, we\u2019re not going to be able to compete against the world. I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is,\u201d he said. When he was asked about that \u201cwages too high\u201d comment two days later, he told Fox News: \u201cAnd they said should we increase the minimum wage? And I\u2019m saying that if we\u2019re going to compete with other countries, we can\u2019t do that because the wages would be too high. \u2026 The question was about the minimum wage. I\u2019m not talking about wages being too high, I\u2019m talking about minimum wage.\u201d\n\nClinton on Trump calling the military \u201ca disaster,\u201d Oct. 12 rally in Las Vegas: \u201cHe\u2019s called our military a \u2018disaster.\u2019 Now, how can you be the commander in chief if you don\u2019t respect the men and women who serve in the United States military?\u201d\n\nAs her running mate, Tim Kaine, has done, Clinton cherry-picks Trump\u2019s words. The Republican nominee did say, in a January primary debate, \u201cOur military is a disaster.\u201d But he has made clear on numerous occasions that he\u2019s referring to the funding of the military, not the men and women who serve in the armed forces. For instance, here\u2019s Trump on Sept. 12 speaking at a National Guard Association Convention: \u201cMy plan calls for a major rebuilding of the entire military and the elimination of the defense \u2014 and we have to do this so quickly, it\u2019s a disaster \u2014 of the defense sequester. It is a disaster. Have no choice, it is a disaster. It\u2019s called depletion. We have been depleted as a military, we can\u2019t let that happen. The greatest men and women on Earth, but we have been depleted by what\u2019s taken place,\u201d Trump said.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump on New York job loss, Oct. 10 rally in Ambridge, Pennsylvania: \u201cAnd Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t have a clue about how to bring back jobs, that I can tell you, folks. She doesn\u2019t have a clue. If she wanted to, she couldn\u2019t do it. You know, in New York state, she ran for the Senate. And you know upstate New York is a disaster for jobs. And she said, \u2018I\u2019m going to bring back 200,000 jobs.\u2019 Guess what? Right down the tubes, worse today than ever before.\u201d\n\nThis is a new twist on an old claim. As we have written before, Trump exaggerated when he claimed last month that New York\u2019s job losses during Hillary Clinton\u2019s eight years as the state\u2019s U.S. senator were \u201cworse than just about any place in the country.\u201d This time, Trump is flat-out wrong when he claimed that New York is \u201cworse today than ever before.\u201d\n\nIt is true, as Trump said, that Clinton in the 2000 campaign promised 200,000 jobs for upstate New York that did not materialize, as documented in an Aug. 7 Washington Post article. But New York is not \u201cworse today than ever before.\u201d As of August, New York\u2019s unemployment rate stood at 4.8 percent, a tick below the national average and well below what it was in 1976, when it was above 10 percent for the entire year. The August unemployment rate in the upstate areas of Buffalo (4.7 percent), Rochester (4.5 percent) and Albany (4 percent) are all roughly half what they were during the Great Recession.\n\nTrump on Clinton\u2019s coal stance, Oct. 10 rally in Ambridge: \u201c[W]eeks before Hillary Clinton made a statement someplace else before going to West Virginia and trying to get their vote, if you can believe this, she said we are going to close the mines and we\u2019re going to put the miners out of work. Then she went to West Virginia and she tried to convince them, well, she didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d\n\nTrump is referring to Clinton\u2019s comments at a CNN town hall forum in March in which she said she wants to \u201cmove away from coal,\u201d but added, \u201cwe don\u2019t want to forget those people.\u201d She promised to bring renewable energy jobs to coal country to replace lost coal jobs.\n\nDonald Trump on Clinton\u2019s emails, Oct. 10 rally in Wilkes-Barre: \u201c33,000 emails \u2026 she deletes them, she bleaches them, that nobody does because it\u2019s such an expensive process. \u2026 After she gets the subpoena, she does that.\u201d\n\nThis is a two-fer. Let\u2019s start with the claim that Clinton \u201cbleached\u201d some of her emails, which Trump went on to describe as unusual and expensive. This frequent line from Trump is wrong on two counts: The software used to delete Clinton\u2019s emails is free, and no chemicals were used. The FBI said that Platte River Networks, which set up and maintained Clinton\u2019s server, used an open-source software program called BleachBit. BleachBit debunks Trump\u2019s claims on its FAQ page: \u201cActually, it is completely free of charge for everyone in all situations.\u201d It also says, \u201cBleachBit is neither a chemical nor a physical device. BleachBit is an anti-forensics software application.\u201d\n\nTrump also twists the facts when he says Clinton deleted emails after she got a subpoena. It is true that 31,830 emails that Clinton\u2019s lawyers deemed personal were deleted after Clinton received a subpoena from a Republican-controlled House committee investigating the 2012 deaths of four Americans in Benghazi. But there is no evidence that Clinton knew that the emails were deleted after the subpoena was issued. The Clinton campaign directed a contractor managing Clinton\u2019s server to delete the emails in December 2014. But the contractor didn\u2019t get around to deleting the emails until late March 2015, after the subpoena was issued. The Clinton campaign says she only learned about the delay in deletions when the FBI released its report on its investigation in September, and we have found no evidence to contradict that.\n\nTrump on Clinton and the red line with Syria, Oct. 10 rally in Wilkes-Barre: \u201cAnd even the bad media admitted \u2013 you know when I said the line in the sand and she said \u2018I wasn\u2019t Secretary of State.\u2019 Unfortunately, she was. She lied again.\u201d\n\nTrump is referring to President Obama\u2019s threat to use military force if Syrian President Bashar Assad used chemical weapons against his own people. But as was the case in the second debate, it\u2019s unclear to us whether Trump was referring to Obama making the threat or not following through on it. As we noted then, Clinton was in office when Obama made his threat in August 2012, but not when the president defended his failure to back it up in September 2013. However, she did publicly support that decision even though she was no longer in office.", "lang": "en"}
