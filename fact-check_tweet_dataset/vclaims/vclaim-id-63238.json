Scott Fitzgerald in 1920 during the Spanish Influenza pandemic.\n\nThe letter is a satirical work written in March 2020.\n\nOne of the deadliest disease outbreaks in human history, the Spanish Influenza pandemic lasted from 1918 to 1919. The outbreak is estimated to have killed more than 25 million people worldwide.\n\nThe Facebook post includes a letter supposedly written by Fitzgerald to someone named \u201cRosemary\u201d during a stay in southern France amid that pandemic. The purported letter discusses Fitzgerald\u2019s feelings about the Spanish Influenza pandemic and also mentions his contemporary Ernest Hemingway.\n\n\u201cEven the bars, as I told Hemingway, but to that he punched me in the stomach, to which I asked if he had washed his hands,\u201d the alleged letter says. \u201cHe hadn\u2019t. He is much the denier, that one. Why, he considers the virus to be just influenza.\u201d\n\nThe letter wasn\u2019t actually written by Fitzgerald. Instead, it is a work of satire published on the website McSweeney\u2019s Internet Tendency on March 13. The parody letter, written by author Nick Farriella, has even been highlighted by the official F. Scott Fitzgerald Facebook page, which is managed by his publisher and his estate.

That in these seemingly dark times, the line of true and untrue was blurred by the need for hope. I think that was something that was at the core of Fitzgerald\u2019s life and work, an unwavering faith in better things to come.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cRosemary\u201d addressed in the satirical letter is likely a nod to Rosemary Hoyt, a fiction character in Fitzgerald\u2019s 1934 novel \u201cTender Is The Night.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
