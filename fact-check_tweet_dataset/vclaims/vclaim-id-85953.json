Mike Rogers's claim that Snowden had help from Russia.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-05-01T17:57:03Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85953", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/01/22/is-snowden-working-for-the-russians/", "vclaim": "Rogers left himself lots of wiggle room\u2014\u201cI think,\u201d \u201cI believe,\u201d \u201cnot a coincidence,\u201d \u201cquestions we have to answer\u201d\u2014but the import of his statements is clear: Snowden had help from the Russians, both to get the documents and to escape American authorities. In particular, Rogers appears to be drawing on a still-classified report by the Defense Intelligence Agency that assessed some of the military damage to the United States.\n\nThe Fact Checker does not have access to the DIA report, so we cannot truly assess the accuracy of the research. (Just because information is contained in an intelligence report does not make it true.) In a joint statement in early January, Rogers and C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.), the ranking Democrat on the committee, said the report showed \u201cmuch of the information stolen by Snowden is related to current U.S. military operations.\u201d\n\nWe should also note that this past week was not the first time that Rogers has suggested Snowden had help from a third party. In a December interview with Fox News, Rogers said Snowden \u201cdid some things capability-wise that was beyond his capabilities.\u201d What is new is the stronger allegation about Russia, meaning Rogers presumably has access to new information.\n\nSnowden, who is currently in Russia, has consistently denied he acted at the behest of any foreign government or shared documents with foreign governments\u2014or even that he took documents with him to Russia. In an interview with The New Yorker after Rogers made his remarks, Snowden insisted that he \u201cclearly and unambiguously acted alone, with no assistance from anyone, much less a government.\u201d\n\nBut before we get too caught up in speculation that seems straight out of a Jack Ryan thriller, let\u2019s take a step back. Rogers and McCaul may have seen some interesting classified evidence, but there are also some hard questions they need to answer before they continue with the Russian spy theme.\n\nIn fact, why would Russia even permit its agent to go public in the first place? Good spy craft generally suggests it is better to keep secret your access to information. A spy within the NSA would have been a useful source for years, so why blow it on a big media splash?\n\nMoreover, Snowden first tried to fly to Ecuador from Hong Kong, and ended up stuck in a Russian transit zone for five weeks. If he had been working with Russia, why wasn\u2019t he treated better in the first place?\n\nSome might argue that Snowden might be helping Russia now, and that\u2019s why he was granted asylum. (German intelligence has pointed to FSB involvement, according to a German media report.) But that\u2019s not what Rogers claimed. He suggested Russia got involved before Snowden downloaded the documents. But if that\u2019s the case, one must also believe Snowden\u2019s long odyssey was simply an elaborate ruse.\n\nThis is obviously a difficult issue to fact check, given the paucity of confirmed information. We are going to take the same approach here as we did with Susan Rice\u2019s widely discussed comments on Benghazi. We awarded her Pinocchios immediately after her statement on the grounds that the publicly available evidence did not match up with her talking points.\n\nThe same holds true here. Rogers may have access to information that is still secret, but then he should not hint or suggest something that, on its face, makes little sense. It is certainly valid to raise questions, but a public official should not hide behind the cloak of classification when making such serious allegations. Feinstein, by contrast, was careful not to make any claim, except that more information is needed.\n\nWe can\u2019t go too hard on Rogers at this point, but we will keep an eye on this issue. The burden falls on the person making the allegation, and Rogers is under notice that he needs to produce more evidence to support such electrifying claims.", "lang": "en"}
