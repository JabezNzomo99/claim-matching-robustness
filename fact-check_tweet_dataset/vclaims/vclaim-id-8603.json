Total pay in Great Britain is growing in real-terms by 0.2% in the three months to July 2018.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-8603", "url": "https://fullfact.org/economy/real-wage-growth-just-above-0/", "vclaim": "Real wage growth is just above 0%\n\nThis is only true for one out of the four different ways you can measure wage growth \u2013 and it\u2019s not a very useful one. The claim is correct for regular wages, but doesn\u2019t account for inflation (the rise in prices) so doesn\u2019t reflect real pay rises. It also doesn\u2019t include bonuses, so won\u2019t reflect the total that some people actually take home.\n\nReal terms total pay (the measure that accounts for inflation and includes bonuses) was growing at 0.2% a year in Great Britain (i.e. not including Northern Ireland) in July 2018. That\u2019s the joint fastest rise since the start of 2017 when wages grew at 0.5%, but still very slow compared to previous years. In 2015 pay increases exceeded 2.5%.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics publishes four forms of data looking at the growth in average weekly earnings across the economy. One is the growth in regular pay\u2014which is pay before bonuses\u2014and at the other is the growth in total pay\u2014which includes bonuses.\n\nBoth of these measures can then be considered with or without inflation to give a total of four metrics.\n\nThe Times used the \u201cregular pay\u201d before inflation measure, which was increasing by 2.9% a year in three months to July 2018, the joint fastest rate since the three months to July 2015 when it was 3%.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t account for how prices are changing, so isn\u2019t that meaningful a figure on its own. It also doesn\u2019t reflect what some people actually take home in their pay packets as it excludes bonuses.\n\nIt also portrays wage growth in its rosiest light\u2014at its highest rate in three years. Meanwhile in July 2018, total pay (not accounting for inflation) was growing at its joint fastest in five months, real-terms total pay and real terms regular pay were both growing at their joint fastest in the last 18 months.\n\nThree years ago total pay was rising by around 2% to 3% per year, but inflation was also close to zero, meaning that real-terms pay was also increasing by 2% to 3% per year.\n\nIn recent months pay has been growing at a similar pace, but in July 2018 inflation was at 2.3%, meaning that the real terms pay growth is much lower.", "lang": "en"}
