Their concerns are moral as well as scientific.\n\nThe British Dental Association has described such tests, in response to the suggestion that young people coming over from Calais should have to take them, as \u201cineffective, inappropriate and unethical\u201d.\n\nIt says that \u201cwisdom teeth can erupt from the age of 10, and do not appear in some adults. These x-rays can therefore only provide an estimate of a patient's age range\u201d.\n\nProfessional guidance for children\u2019s doctors says that:\n\n\u201cestimates of a child\u0092s physical age from his or her dental development are accurate to within + or - 2 years for 95% of the population\u2026 for older children, this margin of uncertainty makes it unwise to rely wholly on dental age\u201d.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a useless tool. Showing that somebody is very likely aged between 21 and 25, say, is a good indication that they are over 18.\n\nHome Office guidance says that asylum applicants will sometimes submit dental tests as evidence that they are a child. \u201cThere will be cases where such reports should be given considerable weight\u2014for example because the applicant\u2019s claimed age is within the possible range\u201d.\n\nBut dentists and doctors see a difference between a voluntary test and a state-imposed one. X-rays, after all, involve exposure to radiation. The BDA says it has resisted efforts by the government to make asylum seekers \u201cundergo a medical procedure without their informed consent and without any planned clinical benefit\u201d for over a decade.", "lang": "en"}
