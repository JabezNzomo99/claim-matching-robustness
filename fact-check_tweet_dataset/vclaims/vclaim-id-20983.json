Trump\u2019s own attorney, Jay Sekulow, said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that the power to pardon oneself has \u201cnever been adjudicated\u201d and would likely be decided by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe president posted his tweet on July 22 \u2014 a day after the Washington Post reported that some of the president\u2019s lawyers are \u201cdiscussing the president\u2019s authority to grant pardons\u201d for his \u201caides, family members and even himself\u201d in connection with the federal investigation into whether the Trump campaign cooperated with Russia\u2019s attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election. The Post report on the issue of pardons was based on anonymous sources described as \u201cpeople familiar with the effort.\u201d\n\nWe asked the White House what the president meant by \u201ccomplete power,\u201d but we have not received a response.\n\nSekulow, Trump\u2019s attorney, described the president\u2019s tweet on \u201cThis Week\u201d as \u201crather unremarkable.\u201d He said that Trump\u2019s tweet was merely stating that \u201cunder the Constitution, under Article Two, Section Two, the president has the authority to pardon.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s what the president meant, Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor and constitutional scholar, told us that Trump would be correct that the Constitution gives the president \u201ccomplete power, rather than only part[ial]\u201d power over pardons.\n\n\u201cThe President decides whether to pardon or not, and no one else can control that decision,\u201d Roosevelt said in an email. \u201cI would say everyone agrees on that.\u201d\n\nBut there are limits to that power, Roosevelt said.\n\n\u201cIf he meant the President can pardon anyone for any offense, he\u2019s wrong,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cThe Constitution says that he can\u2019t use the pardon to undo or prevent an impeachment, and also that he can only pardon for offenses against the United States, which means not for state-law crimes (and state attorneys general do have criminal investigations underway). I would also say everyone agrees on that.\u201d\n\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is looking into both Eric Trump\u2019s foundation and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort\u2019s real estate deals.\n\nHere is what the Constitution says:\n\nBrian Kalt, a Michigan State University law professor, told CNN that a presidential pardon \u201cdoesn\u2019t reach state crimes (only \u2018offenses against the United States\u2019) and it can\u2019t stop or undo a congressional impeachment, but other than that the power is pretty broad.\u201d\n\nSekulow, Trump\u2019s attorney, disputed the Post\u2018s account of discussions among the president\u2019s legal team about possible pardons. He said, \u201cPardons have not been discussed and pardons are not on the table.\u201d\n\nSekulow is referring to Laurence H. Tribe, a Harvard University law professor, and Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University law professor. Both professors separately penned op-eds in the Washington Post on presidential pardons and the issue of whether Trump could pardon himself.\n\nIn a July 21 op-ed, Tribe and two former White House ethics lawyers wrote that the Constitution \u201cspecifically bars the president from using the pardon power to prevent his own impeachment and removal.\u201d\n\nIn the op-ed, Tribe, Richard Painter, who was chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush from 2005 to 2007, and Norman Eisen, who held the same position for President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2011, cited language in the Constitution that specifically bars a president from issuing a pardon \u201cin cases of impeachment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Constitution specifically bars the president from using the pardon power to prevent his own impeachment and removal. It adds that any official removed through impeachment remains fully subject to criminal prosecution,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThat provision would make no sense if the president could pardon himself.\u201d\n\nThe authors of the op-ed also said they agreed with an Aug. 5, 1974, memo written by Mary C. Lawton, who at the time was an acting assistant attorney general in the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel during the Watergate investigation. Lawton\u2019s memo, which was written four days before President Richard Nixon resigned from office, said: \u201cUnder the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case, the President cannot pardon himself.\u201d\n\nTribe and his co-authors argued that the Constitution allows the president \u201cto act essentially in the role of a judge of another person\u2019s criminal case, and to intervene on behalf of the defendant when the president determines that would be equitable.\u201d\n\nOn the same day, Turley wrote that the president \u201cclearly\u201d has the power to pardon his family members and aides and could \u201cprobably\u201d pardon himself, but he advised against it. \u201cIn the end, a pardon of Trump\u2019s allies and family \u2014 let alone himself \u2014 would destroy any legacy of Trump\u2019s and demean his office,\u201d Turley wrote.\n\nLike Sekulow, Turley said the issue of a self-pardon is legally unsettled.\n\n\u201cThe issue of whether a president can pardon himself is one of the unanswered questions of the Constitution; it has never happened in the history of our republic,\u201d Turley wrote. \u201cEven Nixon did not stoop to a self-pardon, although he did research it. Neither did Andrew Johnson or Bill Clinton, both of whom were impeached by the House but not removed from office by the Senate.\u201d\n\nSo, while constitutional scholars agree that the president has the power to pardon others, there are some limits to that power, and the question of whether a president can pardon himself is an unresolved legal issue that remains in dispute.", "lang": "en"}
