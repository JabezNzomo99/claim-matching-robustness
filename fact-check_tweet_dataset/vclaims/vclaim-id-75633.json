A poster in Gujarati that read 'Mahilao Mate Shauchalaya' could be seen in the videos and image. Locals at the venue said that immediately after Gandhi came out of the toilet, people burst out in laughter, India Today reported.\n\nBut Gujarati news channel ABP Asmita gave another version of the incident. In a report, the ABP anchor says that the Special Protection Group traveling with Gandhi directed him to the women's toilet after ensuring no one was using it.\n\nBOOM has not been able to independently verify ABP's version of the incident.\n\nHowever, a Congress spokesperson clarified that due to security reasons, the men's toilet was kept locked. The entry to the men's toilet were also blocked due to the presence of the camera persons covering Gandhi. The SPG asked Gandhi to use the only toilet available at the location and it was ensured no one was present inside before giving him clearance.", "lang": "en"}
