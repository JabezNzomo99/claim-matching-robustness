On Sept. 1, we came across another rumor involving a meme that supposedly showed Rittenhouse\u2019s parents:\n\nThe people in the above-displayed image are not Rittenhouse\u2019s parents.\n\nThe image on the left has been online since at least July 7, 2020, when it was shared on the \u201cVideo\u2019s and Memes\u201d Facebook page along with derogatory remarks about the pictured individual. A few days later, the image was shared to the \u201cGeezer Board\u201d and the \u201cThanks I Hate It\u201d section of Reddit. None of those early postings identified the individual in this image. The claim that it showed Rittenhouse\u2019s father was seemingly pulled out of thin air in the days following the shooting.\n\nThe claim that the image on the right shows Rittenhouse\u2019s mother is equally baseless. This image first started going viral when it was attached to the claim that it showed Rittenhouse\u2019s mother after she drove her son to the protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin. This image, however, was taken the night prior to the deadly shooting, and shows a woman in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\nThe photographer provided some additional details about this image on Twitter:\n\nThe original photograph was first posted online without any information about the person\u2019s identity. After the shooting, social media users started to claim that it pictured Rittenhouse\u2019s mother, but offered nothing in terms of proof. This claim, again, appears to have been made up out of whole cloth.\n\nThe photograph supposedly showing Rittenhouse\u2019s mother is often shared along with the claim that she drove her son to the protest on the night of the shooting. But we have not been able to find any credible reporting to support this claim. In fact, a statement from Rittenhouse\u2019s lawyers disputes this idea, noting that \u201cKyle and a friend armed themselves with rifles due to the deadly violence gripping Kenosha and many other American cities, and headed to the business premises.\u201d\n\nIn summation, there is no evidence to support the claim that the above-displayed images show Rittenhouse\u2019s parents. This claim is based on unfounded assumptions, and the \u201cidentity\u201d of these people was only noted after Rittenhouse\u2019s name made headlines.", "lang": "en"}
