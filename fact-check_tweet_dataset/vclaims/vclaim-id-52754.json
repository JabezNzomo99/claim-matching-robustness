Before signing an executive order that seeks to provide incentives for police departments to increase training on the use of force, Trump asserted that Obama and his vice president \u201cnever even tried to fix this during their eight-year period.\u201d\n\nA final 115-page report was delivered in May 2015 with dozens of recommendations, such as seeking more data on police-involved shootings, \u201cwhether fatal or nonfatal, as well as any in-custody death\u201d; improved assessments of community attitudes toward police; and the removal of incentives on police practices such as a predetermined number of tickets, citations, arrests or summonses.\n\nIndeed, elements of Trump\u2019s executive order could have been lifted from the Obama-era report. Trump called on the Justice Department to encourage more training of police officers with \u201crespect to encounters with individuals suffering from impaired mental health, homelessness, and addiction.\u201d The Obama report had several recommendations along those lines, including making \u201cCrisis Intervention Training (CIT) a part of both basic recruit and in-service officer training.\u201d\n\nOf course, recommendations are only a start \u2014 just as signing an executive order does not mean policy is being implemented. The Obama task force issued an implementation guide for police departments and a year later reported that 15 police departments had agreed to an action plan to implement the recommendations.\n\nThat might seem like a drop in the bucket, but the report was closely studied by other police departments. \u201cAccording to a survey of forty-seven of the largest law enforcement agencies in the United States from 2015 to 2017 conducted by the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA) and the National Police Foundation, 39 percent of the departments changed their use of force policies and revised their training to incorporate de-escalation and beef up scenario-based training approaches. Significantly, officer-involved shootings during this period dropped by 21 percent in the agencies surveyed,\u201d Robinson said in a recent assessment of police reforms since Ferguson.\n\nObama\u2019s Justice Department also aggressively pursued consent decrees, approved by courts, in which police departments agreed to a road map of changes and reforms. Trump\u2019s first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, ordered a review of such deals when he came into office and then sharply limited their use and their length on the day he was fired.\n\nAsked about Trump\u2019s comments, Nancy G. La Vigne, vice president for justice policy at the Urban Institute, responded: \u201cUntrue. There actually were extensive efforts to reform policing that were evidence-based and informed by leading experts in the field. This includes the Task Force on 21st Century Policing and the National Initiative in Building Community Trust and Justice,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cFurther, DOJ under AG Eric Holder pursued consent decrees and pattern and practice investigations [of misconduct] with vigor \u2014 two strategies that this administration has abandoned.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis President is about action and this executive order will do more than any previous administration on police reform,\u201d a senior administration official said. \u201cThis executive order has both law enforcement and victims\u2019 families\u2019 buy-in. This is meaningful action for victims and their families, but we won\u2019t solve this problem by demonizing police. We must work together with them, and this executive order will help to resolve some of the issues of injustices we see across the country.\u201d\n\nThis is one of those needlessly false claims made by President Trump. He could have offered a reasoned critique of the actions taken by Obama, given that his administration has rolled back or limited some of the actions that Obama instituted in response to Ferguson. Instead, Trump asserted, without any basis, that Obama and Biden \u201cnever even tried to fix this during their eight-year period.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
