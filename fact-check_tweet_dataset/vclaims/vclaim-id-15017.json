Sad and shameful\u2026list are getting just bigger and bigger of traitors within our country. Enemies in house are more dangerous then those operating from Pakistan. Congress party supporters shouting \u201cPakistan zindabad\u201d slogans. It\u2019s an insult not just of our Armed Forces but of each one of us above all our Motherland!\n\nFrom what it seems, the video is being circulated on WhatsApp with the identical narrative.\n\nThe above video has been doing rounds on social media since before the start of the 2018 assembly elections.\n\nIn one watches the video carefully, a banner placed on the stage reads \u2013 \u2018Nagar Congress Committee Rajsamand\u2019.\n\nThe crowd of Congress workers actually chants \u2013 \u201cMai lai lalkar hai, hamaki sau ke paar hai. Bhati Saab Zindabad (We have accepted the challenge. This time we will score more than 100. Long live Bhati Saab).\u201d\n\nNarayan Singh Bhati was the Congress candidate from Rajsmand, Rajasthan. Alt News has broken down that part of the video where the crowd chanted his name. When heard multiple times over, \u201cBhati Saab Zindabad\u201d is audible more clearly.\n\nAlt News had debunked this video last year itself when Madhu Kishwar had shared it.\n\nThe Congress has often been targetted on social media with false claims that its members chanted pro-Pakistan slogans. Last month, three separate videos were shared to support the same narrative. Similarly, there have been false claims of Pakistani flags being raised in Congress rallies.", "lang": "en"}
