Kaaba is the building at the center of the Great Mosque of Mecca. The video and message have been shared on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nThe above tweet was posted on July 7 and has been retweeted over a thousand times so far. The video clip is 49 seconds long, and has been posted by several individual users on Facebook with a slightly altered claim that the young man seen in the video is an Iranian.\n\nTo fact-check this claim, Alt News searched Google with specific keywords, and found an article by Gulf News published in February 2017, pertaining to this very incident. This was verified by comparing the viral video with the video of the incident posted in the article, which has been taken from a different angle. According to Gulf News, the man was attempting to commit suicide by dousing himself in fuel before he was successfully apprehended.\n\nThe incident was also reported by Arab News which stated, \u201cSaudi security forces successfully prevented a man from setting himself alight beside the Kaaba inside Makkah\u2019s Grand Mosque late on Monday. The man, who police said shows signs of mental illness, tried to set himself alight with gasoline but was arrested before he could do so.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Alt News found that several social media users had posted videos related to this incident on YouTube in 2017.\n\nIt may be noted that the claim circulating on social media along with the video is false \u2013 the person in question is neither pouring milk over the Kaaba nor is he claiming that it is Shivling. He was trying to immolate himself.", "lang": "en"}
