So if Bryson is right about 500 failing schools, that means nearly 20 percent of schools fall into that category.\n\nHis proposed solution, a relatively new and controversial program called an achievement school district, or ASD, is moving forward in North Carolina.\n\nThe ASD program was approved by the N.C. House on June 2 (the day after Bryson published his argument) and is now up for a vote in the Senate. The idea is to take a handful of the lowest-performing schools away from their districts and turn them over to charter school operators.\n\nBryson said it\u2019s noteworthy that there are 500 failing schools because such schools \"remain broken education communities, systematically failing to teach tens of thousands of students without any path towards meaningful, long-term reform or improved achievement.\"\n\nWe wondered if the picture was really so bleak.\n\nHow many schools are failing?\n\nThe state has give out school grades since the 2013-14 school year. Last year, 146 schools received Fs.\n\nThat\u2019s a far cry from 500, so we asked Bryson where his number came from. He said he was actually underestimating it \u2013 that there are 547 low-performing schools, according to a state law that defines the term.\n\nHowever, \"low-performing\" is not the same as \"failing\" \u2013 the law that Bryson cited includes F schools as well as D schools. And as any slacker can tell you, D\u2019s get degrees.\n\nFor Bryson to count D schools as failing seems to be self-evidently wrong. But that\u2019s not the whole story.\n\nThe state gave its schools a grading scale that we all would\u2019ve loved to have had ourselves. While a typical grading scale gives any score below 60 an F and then goes up by 10-point intervals, North Carolina uses the following scale to grade its schools:\n\nThe scores are mostly based on how students do on standardized tests, with a small amount of consideration given to whether the schools met their expected student growth goals. Grades for high schools also include factors like graduation rates.\n\nIf the state used a traditional scale, every D school (and even some C schools) would have instead received an F. That\u2019s a pretty good argument in Bryson\u2019s favor.\n\nWe decided we needed to talk to an expert on education policy to determine whether the state had a good reason to give itself this scale, or if it was simply protecting its image.\n\nEric Houck is a former public school teacher who now teaches education policy at UNC-Chapel Hill. He said many academics, including himself, don\u2019t really pay attention to school grades \u2013 including the question of whether the scale is too generous.\n\nThe rubric doesn\u2019t give much weight to how much students improved in a given year, Houck said, and instead focuses mostly on raw scores. He said that punishes schools for having students who came to them below grade level and largely ignores how well teachers did getting those students caught up.\n\n\"The entire grading system is a little suspect in terms of being able to accurately identify what schools are actually failing,\" he said.\n\nThe \"low-performing\" metric that Bryson cited includes all D and F schools that didn\u2019t meet their growth goals, as well as those that met their growth goals. Those that exceeded their growth goals are not considered low-performing.\n\nThat\u2019s a bit more in line with Houck\u2019s philosophy on how to best judge schools, but it\u2019s still misleading to say all those students are being left behind.\n\nBy equating \"low-performing\" with \"failing,\" Bryson\u2019s claim considers a school to be failing if its average student is a D student whose scores are improving as much as the state expects.\n\nA reasonable person wouldn\u2019t say that student is failing. He\u2019s below average, but above the threshold for failure and on track for improvement.\n\nAnd nearly half of the schools Bryson is talking about, 225 of them, are in that category.\n\nPaying a bit more attention to growth, like Houck suggested, we found that a better estimate of the number of failing schools could range from 80 to 415, depending on how much you trust the state to have given itself a fair grading scale.\n\u2022 80: The number of F schools in 2014-15 that did not meet their expected growth.\n\u2022 146: The number of F schools in 2014-15.\n\u2022 299: The number of low-performing schools that did not meet their expected growth (out of 547 total low-performing schools).\n\u2022 415: The number of schools that scored 59 or below in 2014-15 and thus would\u2019ve received an F on a traditional grading scale, and which also didn\u2019t meet growth goals.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say exactly how many failing schools are in North Carolina, but we do know there are not 500 like AFP state director Donald Bryson said.\n\nHe was referring to low-performing schools, but the majority of low-performing schools are D schools \u2013 which most people don\u2019t consider failing.\n\nWe counted failing schools in a number of ways, with the results ranging from 80 to 415 depending on the grading scale used to define what an F is.\n\nAny way you slice it there are clearly dozens, and maybe hundreds, of failing schools statewide. Bryson\u2019s statement was overly broad, but it\u2019s not totally wrong. We rate this claim Half True.", "lang": "en"}
