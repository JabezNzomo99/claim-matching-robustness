Because Biden managed to squeeze months of diplomacy into a few hours when he recounted the story years later at the Council on Foreign Relations. Biden\u2019s tale, ironically, has become exhibit 1 in President Trump\u2019s false narrative that Biden ousted the prosecutor because he was investigating a company associated with his son Hunter Biden. As we have reported, the drive to push out Shokin was an international effort widely celebrated at the time.\n\n\u201cI remember going over, convincing our team \u2026 that we should be providing for loan guarantees. \u2026 And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from [then-Prime Minister Arseniy] Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor [Shokin]. And they didn\u2019t\u2026They were walking out to a press conference. I said, \u2018Nah, \u2026 We\u2019re not going to give you the billion dollars.\u2019 They said, \u2018You have no authority. You\u2019re not the president.\u2019 \u2026 I said, \u2018Call him.\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars.\u2019 \u2026 I looked at them and said, \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money.\u2019 Well, son of a b----. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\u201d\n\nBiden followed up with a visit to Kiev in December. On Dec. 7, he held a news conference with Poroshenko and announced $190 million to \u201cfight corruption in law enforcement and reform the justice sector.\u201d He made no public mention of the loan guarantee, but behind the scenes he had explicitly linked the $1 billion loan guarantee to reform efforts, including removing Shokin, according to Colin Kahl, Biden\u2019s national security adviser at the time.\n\nKahl said Biden had a version of the parliament speech in which he would have announced the loan guarantee if Poroshenko immediately had taken the actions demanded by the United States and its international partners. But since the Ukrainian leader did not remove Shokin during that trip, Biden instead emphasized the country\u2019s corruption in his speech.\n\nOn March 31, Poroshenko met with Biden during a trip to Washington, and Biden emphasized that the loan guarantee was contingent on further reform progress beyond Shokin\u2019s removal. \u201cThe Vice President welcomed the efforts of President Poroshenko to form a stable, reform-oriented government, and stressed that this step, as well as the enactment of needed reforms, are critical to unlocking international economic assistance, including the third $1 billion U.S. loan guarantee,\u201d the White House said.\n\nOn April 14, Biden and Poroshenko had another call. Biden congratulated the president on his new cabinet and \u201cstressed the urgency of putting in place a new Prosecutor General who would bolster the agency\u2019s anti-corruption efforts and strongly support the work of its reformers,\u201d a White House statement said. The Ukrainian press service reported \u201cthe parties agreed that an agreement on the issue of the third tranche of credit guarantees in the amount of $1 billion will soon be signed.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
