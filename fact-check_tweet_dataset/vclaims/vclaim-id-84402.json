Anaerobic glycolysis is a metabolic pathway wherein glucose breaks down into lactate and not into pyruvate as it normally would in the presence of oxygen. The glucose breaks down into pyruvate in order to provide energy for the cell to function.\n\nIn anaerobic glycolysis as observed by Warburg, the glucose molecules, even in the presence of oxygen, behave as they would in the absence of oxygen, where in they convert into lactate, cells create energy by fermentation. This leads to the growth of cancer cells.\n\nThe claim that exercise will lead to more oxygen entering the body and leads to reduction in cancer cells is not scientifically backed and is misleading.\n\nDr. Murad's Nobel winning study says that blockages in the arteries can be removed by eating raw vegetables and fruits as they have nitric oxide. The image claims that eating plenty vegetables and fruits will lead to the removal of blockages in the arteries and lead to better blood supply to healthy cells.\n\nThe role of nitric oxide in cancer treatment is quite unclear. A study conducted in 2016 states that nitric oxide can act as a tumour suppressor as well as a cancer promoting agent.\n\nThe image speaks about blood flow and blockages in the artery while not discussing the impact of the same on cancer.\n\n\n\nDr. Ohsumi's study concerns Autophagy where cells when starved eat damaged and cancerous cells. The image interprets that fasting increases immunity and can kill cancerous cells. It thus advises people \"Be fast\" at least once a week to increase immunity.\n\nAutophagy means self-eating. Cells when starved of nutrients tend to search for damaged cells and consume them.\n\nWhile fasting has been studied for its advantages, there is not enough research backing the theory stating practicing it once a week, could affect carcinogenic cells. Just like nitric oxide, autophagy can also either suppress or promote tumours on the basis of the environment and the developmental stage of the tumour. This was proved in a study in 2018.\n\nBOOM contacted Dr. Baig to understand his reasons for making the picture.\n\nHe is a chiropractor and physiotherapist based out of Hyderabad and is a proponent of alternative medicine.\n\n\"There are more than 2 millions doctors in our country though they unable to cure simple disorder that is BP and advise medicine for life Time to make business. BP can be cured with simple technique such as eating raw food and walking for 10 to 15 minutes. But no doctor tells you because they did not study nutrition they study only medicine\", said Dr. Baig.\n\n\"Do not get advise from medical professionals who are indirectly controled by pharma companies. if you need correct information study the great personalities who are working for human kind,\" he concluded.\n\nWhat Do Oncologists Say?\n\n\"Cancer is sort of a multi-step process and not as simplistic as the image makes it seem. High pressure oxygen chambers are being experimentally used but there isn't complete evidence,\" Dr Lala said about the oxygen theory.\n\nFor the other two theories, he mentioned that a few statements have been taken out of context and the studies have been misinterpreted.\n\n\"People should give context to everything on Google before making decisions on their own and consult their physicians and specialists for further treatment,\" Dr. Lala concluded.", "lang": "en"}
