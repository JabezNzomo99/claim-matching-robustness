Though not very viral, it was shared with the same misleading claim of the images being from Modi\u2019s Varanasi rally.\n\nview the post and here to view the\n\nBOOM searched for all the four images and found that they are\n\nfrom old rallies from different places.\n\nThe image of a rally with a huge gathering is claimed to be from Varanasi but a simple Google reverse image search of the image led us to results from the Hunkaar rally in Patna, Bihar from 2013.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s official website carried the image in an article which is titled \u2018Hunkaar rally is historic and will script a new chapter in history of India.\u2019\n\nJust before Modi started speaking, there were multiple blasts\n\nnear the venue of the rally and 83 people were injured and 2 were critical, reported\n\nThe image with Modi on a truck covered with flowers in the\n\nmiddle of the road with people all around is an old picture of him from a\n\nroadshow in Varanasi in 2014 when Narendra Modi had filed nomination in\n\nVaranasi. There were even reports\n\nthat said that people were brought in on rent for Modi\u2019s roadshow.\n\nThe third image showing the same scene as the second photo is also from the 2014 rally in Varanasi. Taken at the same rally as the second photo, it is from the time Modi filed his nomination in Varanasi.\n\nAfter multiple searches BOOM reached a blog which had the same elements in the image. The truck loaded with flowers and a banner reading, \"\u0905\u091a\u094d\u091b\u0947 \u0926\u093f\u0928 \u0906\u0928\u0947\u0935\u093e\u0932\u0947 \u0939\u0948 \" and the car ahead of it are the same.\n\nThe image in which PM Modi is seen waving at a crowd from a car is from a rally in Varanasi from March, 2017 where after a roadshow, he addressed the people and spoke to them about the UP government blocking all the efforts of the Centre to develop the state.\n\nIn both the images which has PM Narendra Modi in them, Modi is seen wearing different clothes.\n\nIn February 2019, Modi visited Varanasi announced projects worth Rs. 2,900 crore.
