The claim is misleading as it is based on an American woman who does claim discrimination but does not become a millionaire.\n\nThe Facebook post from January 26, 2019 is linked to a headline titled: \u201cSouth African woman job interview denied because she was pregnant - 2 weeks later, she fires back\u201d.\n\nThe same story can be found posted here. It identifies the woman as Lindsey Wilson, a 24-year-old South African woman living in Durban.\n\nBut a Google reverse image search of the picture in the article leads to an interview conducted by US TV network Fox 13 on August 9, 2018 about a Lindsey Wilcox living in Florida -- see the interview below.\n\nWilcox said a popular family diner in Florida denied her an interview because she was pregnant. After a backlash on social media, Wilcox says she received an apology and another opportunity to interview for the job -- which she declined.\n\nShe says nothing about a \u201cR12 million inheritance\u201d as the misleading article claims.\n\nIt is illegal in South Africa to discriminate against an employee or fire them because they are pregnant.", "lang": "en"}
