In order to verify the claims, The Logical Indian looked for official notifications on these 'fake eggs' by the FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India), which is an autonomous body established under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India.\n\nAccording to the FSSAI website , \"There is no technology or chemicals available to complete the manufacturing of whole eggs. Also, it is not economically viable process since normal eggs are available in abundance & at an affordable price.\"\n\nThe website further adds that a thick eggshell membrane indicates the freshness of the eggs. When the egg is fresh, there is not enough time for evaporation to separate the 2 membranes (outer and inner layers) causing it to stick to each other. This makes it look thicker and stronger when it is peeled. Also, the inner shell membrane of the eggs may become harder & elastic when it is older than 15 days, which is a natural ageing process.\n\nVarying features of eggs are due to difference in quality of feed, breed of bird, ageing of eggs & the handling of eggs.\n\nFurther, in the process of ageing, \"the egg white changes its consistency, becomes thin and runny and finally egg yolk and white dissolve into each other & this mixing is aggravated by temperature abuse & not because egg is made artificially.\"\n\nThe website of FSSAI carries the viral video.\n\nIn 2018, the body had issued a notification on the 'egg safety guidance'. The notification also busted the myth about plastic eggs. This notification can be read here.\n\nA broadcast by Zee Business on this notification can be watched here.\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343.\n\nAlso Read: Video Of Machine Manufacturing Snacks Shared With Cautionary Claims Regarding Fake Cashew Nuts In Market", "lang": "en"}
