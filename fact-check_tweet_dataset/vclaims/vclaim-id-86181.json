Each of those rallies usually yielded 35 to 45 suspect claims. But the president often tacked on interviews with local media (in which he repeats the same false statements) and gaggles with the White House press corps before and after his trips.\n\nThe second biggest month was November, with 866 claims, and that\u2019s largely because of the president\u2019s rallies just before the Nov. 6 election. Four of his five most prolific days for falsehoods fell in November.\n\nMore than a quarter of Trump\u2019s claims, 2,030, came during campaign rallies. An additional 1,944 came during remarks during press events, and 1,314 were the result of the president\u2019s itchy Twitter finger.\n\nIn terms of subjects, false or misleading claims about immigration top the list, totaling 1,130. Claims about foreign policy and trade tied for second, with 822 claims, followed by claims about the economy (768) and jobs (741).", "lang": "en"}
