Google search results suggest the quote did not appear on the internet prior to June 2017.\n\nThe quote references Merton, where Mrs May served as a councillor from 1986 to 1994. When the image was first shared on social media in 2017, BuzzFeed News reported that a spokesperson for the Conservative party said it was false, and the editor of local newspaper the Wimbledon Guardian (often suggested as the original source of the quote) was unable to trace it.\n\nHowever, as the Wimbledon Guardian\u2019s archives are incomplete, it\u2019s impossible to definitively say that the quote did not come from there.\n\nLabour\u2019s Diane Abbott also shared, and then deleted the image in 2017. The image had previously appeared across social media.\n\nAs noted by BuzzFeed, the photo of Mrs May is from 1992, when she first stood for parliament in North West Durham, but several versions of the quote claim she said it in 1988, when section 28 of the Local Government Act, an amendment banning the promotion of homosexuality in schools, was being passed.", "lang": "en"}
