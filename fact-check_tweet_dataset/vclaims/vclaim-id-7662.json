It did not say that Scotland would have to make public expenditure reductions, something another panellist pointed out during the show.\n\nPublic spending according to the Sustainable Growth Commission\n\nThe Commision sets out its stall saying \u201cOur public finances can be put right sustainably from the unsustainable position we inherit from the UK system at present. And we can do so in a way that continues to grow public spending while stewarding the growth position of the economy\u201d.\n\nWe asked Kwasi Kwarteng what he meant and he highlighted the Commission\u2019s view that an independent Scotland should take or inherit responsibility for a share of the UK\u2019s national debt. He pointed to reports of some former nationalists interpreting this to mean that fiscal discipline or austerity would be practised.\n\nReducing the deficit in the UK public spending has been associated with significant reductions known as austerity, and at least one independence campaigner has reportedly rejected the Commission\u2019s report on the basis that it would lead to \u201cpainful cuts\u201d.\n\nThis is not what the Commission thinks.\n\nThe Commission says that an independent Scotland should limit its public spending to reduce its deficit. It says that spending should be \u201csufficiently less than GDP growth over the business cycle to reduce the deficit to below 3% within 5 to 10 years\u201d.\n\nAt the same time it says that public spending could still continue to grow while following that rule if the Scottish economy grows in line with current trends.\n\nSo that is the unknown: if the Scottish economy grew fast enough after independence, then it could increase public spending and reduce its deficit. If it doesn\u2019t, there would be choices between a larger deficit (and so, the independent Scotland\u2019s debt increasing faster), reduced public spending, or higher tax.\n\nThe report doesn\u2019t rule out an independent Scotland leaving the pound, but says it shouldn\u2019t happen overnight\n\n\u201cThe Commission recommends that Scotland keep the pound \u201cfor a possibly extended transition period\u201d. Moving to a new currency would be \u201cbased on a governance process and criteria set out clearly in advance of voters making a decision on independence.\u201d While still part of the pound, Scotland wouldn\u2019t be able to set its own monetary policy (things like setting interest rates), which would still be done by the Bank of England.\n\nAny transition to an independent currency would require a \u201cfinancial infrastructure\u201d to be developed, and happen when it was \u201cappropriate for the Scottish economy\u201d, according to the Commission.", "lang": "en"}
