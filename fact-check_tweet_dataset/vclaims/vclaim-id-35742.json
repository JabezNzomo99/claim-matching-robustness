(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nIt\u2019s not clear where the video clips were shot, but they show a variety of disturbing scenes, including what appear to be four people in hazmat suits loading something into a van; an older Asian man being handcuffed and led away by what appear to be two police officers wearing medical face masks; and a younger Asian man outdoors wearing only underwear being led away by two men wearing uniforms.\n\nAs the video clips play, a male narrator says officials in the U.K. \u2014 which comprises England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland \u2014 are desperately searching for hundreds of coronavirus cases. He goes on to share more conspiracy theories about the virus\u2019 origins.\n\nBut the data doesn't indicate any such panic in the U.K.\n\u2022 The World Health Organization reported only nine confirmed cases of coronavirus in the U.K. (British officials say the number has risen to 13.) Eight of the people have been treated and discharged, The Telegraph, a British news organization reported.\n\u2022 The risk of catching the coronavirus in the U.K. is low, according to the country\u2019s National Health Service.\n\u2022 British officials say they are monitoring airports with direct flights from China, and are recommending movement restrictions to residents only if they have been to Wuhan recently or have been to China or nearby countries and have respiratory symptoms.\n\nThe post was made by STFN Reloaded. We have also rated as False a claim by that group that the coronavirus \"causes sudden death syndrome.\" And the Australian Associated Press said an STFN Reloaded claim that the coronavirus came from a Chinese lab is false.\n\nA Facebook post says: \"Breaking: UK Prepares For Full Lockdown After Hundreds Of New Cases \u2014 Wuhan Super Virus Updates.\"\n\nThere are fewer than 10 coronavirus cases in the United Kingdom and no signs that travel or other aspects of life in Britain have been shut down by the virus.", "lang": "en"}
