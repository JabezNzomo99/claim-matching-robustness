However, as always, the emotional appeal of the message clouds judgement and the picture is currently viral on the internet.\n\nA Twitter user, Jitendra Pratap Singh, who is followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tweeted, \u201c\u0907\u0924\u0928\u0940 \u092d\u0940 \u0924\u092e\u0940\u091c \u0928\u0939\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u091c\u0935\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u0947 \u092a\u0940\u0920 \u092a\u0930 \u092a\u0948\u0930 \u0930\u0916\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u092a\u0939\u0932\u0947 \u091c\u0942\u0924\u0940 \u0909\u0924\u093e\u0930 \u0932\u0947\u0902 ..\u091c\u0942\u0924\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u094b\u0932 \u0915\u0940 \u0928\u094b\u0915 \u0915\u093f\u0924\u0928\u0940 \u091a\u0941\u092d\u0940 \u0939\u094b\u0917\u0940 ..\u0907\u0928\u0915\u0947 \u092e\u093e\u0902 \u092c\u093e\u092a \u0915\u092d\u0940 \u0907\u0928\u094d\u0939\u0947\u0902 \u0924\u092e\u0940\u091c \u0938\u0932\u0940\u0915\u093e \u0938\u0901\u0938\u094d\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0928\u0939\u0940 \u0938\u093f\u0916\u093e\u0924\u0947\u201d (She doesn\u2019t even have the manners to take off her shoes\u2026.the heel of the shoe must have hurt him so much\u2026their parents never teach them manners, principles and values \u2013 translated)\n\nWhere is the image really from?\n\nA simple Google reverse search reveals some interesting details about the picture. It is of a member of the Iraqi PMU (Popular Mobilization Units) helping a civilian after the city of Fallujah was freed from ISIS in June 2016.\n\nThe image has been at the center of an international fake news controversy. In December 2016, the Syrian envoy to the United Nations was widely criticized for using it to show how pro-government forces were \u2018liberating\u2019 city of Aleppo. \u201cSyria UN ambassador caught using fake photo at council\u201d ran an Al Jazeera headline at the time. The photograph has now traveled around the world and reached India.\n\nThe same image was also circulated during Kashmir floods, claiming it as that of Indian army.\n\nIn the past, it has also been shared claiming that the image is of Turkish army.\n\nThe Indian army is playing a stellar role in Kerala flood rescue operations. It doesn\u2019t need those circulating misleading images to whip up support.", "lang": "en"}
