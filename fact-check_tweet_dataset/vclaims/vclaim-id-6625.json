But let us look at Labour\u2019s record on this issue, in the last six years of the last Labour government, 25,000 hospital beds were cut\u201d\n\nThe number of hospital beds has been falling over the past decade, regardless of who was in office.\n\nThe total number of overnight hospital beds in the English NHS has actually been falling almost constantly since the 1980s. It fell by about 26,000 in the last six years of the most recent Labour government as Mrs May says, and it\u2019s still falling now as Mr Corbyn says.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear that we need as many beds as we used to. The average length of stay has fallen since the turn of the century (though not quite by half). The average length of stay overnight in 2000 was about eight days, and it\u2019s about five days now.\n\nThat said, the fact that we\u2019re spending fewer nights in hospital doesn\u2019t completely explain away why bed numbers are falling.\n\nThe proportion of beds that are occupied has been rising slowly since 2010. From July to September last year the proportion hit 87.5% \u2014 the highest recorded figure for that time of year. That\u2019s higher than the safe level of 85% recommended by NHS Providers and the Royal College of Psychiatrists.", "lang": "en"}
