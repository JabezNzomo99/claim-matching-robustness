Greitens challenged Koster on several of his policies and political history, claiming that Koster is a \"career politician\" who opposes right-to-work efforts because he has taken \"$8 million from union bosses.\"\n\nThis number seemed high, so we decided to check out the claim. We also wondered if Koster, as Greitens said, opposed right-to-work efforts because of union campaign donations.\n\nKoster's top three union contributors each gave his campaign more than $1 million. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), a public services employees union, was Koster's top contributor, topping out at $1,250,000. AFSCME was followed closely by the Eastern Missouri Laborers' Educational & Benevolent Fund at $1,091,739 and Jobs and Opportunity, a democratic leadership PAC, coming in at $1,001,432.\n\nBy far, Koster has received more contributions from unions over all other candidates running for any Missouri offices this year. The next highest total of union donations for any Missouri candidate is Democratic candidate for attorney general Teresa Hensley, with $692,849.00. Greitens doesn't even appear on the union donations list.\n\nOpposing right-to-work legislation is an important part of Koster's campaign. Koster and other Democrats have used the term \"right-to-work for less\" to support their argument that a right-to-work law in Missouri would lead to lower pay for workers due to weakened collective bargaining efforts \u2014 efforts they say are made possible by those required fees.\n\nOn the other hand, it's Greitens' belief that \"right to work laws help the economy as a whole and union workers.\" The Greitens campaign directed us toward some statistics from the Labor Bureau of Statistics and pointed us specifically to Indiana. Under H.R. 1, the Federal Election Commission \u201cfor the first time ever, instead of being an equal number of Republicans and Democrats (would be) three of one side and two of the other.\"\n\nTaking a look at this information alone would suggest a correlation between right-to-work and increased union employment. As of 2015, 10 percent of Indiana's employed workers were members of unions, and 11.3 percent of workers were represented by unions. In Missouri, those numbers were 8.8 percent and 9.8 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nSo is there any evidence that the donations affected Koster\u2019s position on right-to-work? When we reached out to the Koster campaign, we received this response from David Turner, his campaign's communications director: \"I reject the premise of the question and the assertion that the Attorney General's policy positions are at all influenced by campaign donations. Going back to the start of his career, Attorney General Koster has long record of advocating for working people, even when he was a Republican.\" Turner provided us with examples of Koster's advocacy \"for working people\" dating back to 2004. Included was a link to a Springfield News-Leader story published after Koster broke with the GOP and became a Democrat. The story states: \"The Republican Party's disregard of workers rights, Koster said, is one reason he left the party.\" Greitens said Koster received $8 million from unions and opposes right-to-work legislation. There is no doubt Koster opposes right-to-work laws. And Greitens actually understates the total amount of Koster\u2019s labor donations. He has received more than $12 million from unions, according to the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry. But there is no evidence his position against right-to-work is influenced by these donations. Greitens is taking two accurate talking points and putting them together in a misleading way. We rate this claim to be Half True.", "lang": "en"}
