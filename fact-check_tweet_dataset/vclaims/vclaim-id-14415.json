If you put the PIN number and then press the cancel button even once it will cancel that transaction.\"\n\nU.S.- based fact-checking website Snopes also debunked the message earlier this month.\n\nThe message specifically mentions RBI in order to give the forward credibility. Many fake messages on social media follow the same structure of mentioning a credible authority so that the message is taken seriously. A few of the messages also include the link to the website making the fake message look more real. But the URL often leads to only the home page of the website and not to any specific page.\n\n\"No, the RBI will never get into this. This is just a rumor as RBI doesn\u2019t get into how an ATM functions. How the ATM functions depends entirely on the Banks and the vendors who have given the ATM services want the ATM to function. RBI has no role in it,\" Shenoy said.\n\nHowever, ATM fraud is still a common occurrence. Here are some of the ways listed by livemint that you can use to protect yourself from theft when withdrawing money from an ATM.", "lang": "en"}
