Users are misleadingly claiming the footage shows a police station, which was also set on fire during the protests, but the building in question is an apartment complex that was under construction.\n\nA post with the misleading claim reads: \u201c#GeorgeFloyd the police station where officer was based burnt to the ground. One corrupt racist Police officer causes this. #Minneapolisprotests #BlackLivesMatter #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd\u201d ( here ). Other examples of the posts are visible here and here .\n\nThe footage in these posts shows an apartment building under construction located at the corner of E 29th St and 26th Ave S in Minneapolis, next to a 7-Sigma Inc building (this building is visible on Google maps, but the complex set on fire was yet to begin construction bit.ly/36IolCi ). The Star Tribune reported the 189 unit complex was to be a six-story \u201caffordable housing development\u201d ( strib.mn/2McjoZ7 ).\n\nOther angles of this fire circulating online (see here , here ) match up to scenes on Google Maps, albeit prior to the apartment complex being built (goo.gl/maps/VwYRxBgYT57yZ2Cd7 and goo.gl/maps/4viKsg77GzLYqSwc7 )\n\nThe Third Precinct is located a short distance from the apartment complex in these posts ( goo.gl/maps/Wk6P4DxNgJt7T9y98 ). It also was set on fire during the protests, visible in images reut.rs/2ZQH25E and here .\n\nProtests erupted in Minneapolis this week over the death of George Floyd on Monday, May 25. Floyd, 46, was seen in a widely circulated video, lying face down and handcuffed by police, groaning for help and repeatedly saying, \u201cplease, I can\u2019t breathe,\u201d before growing motionless ( here ).\n\nPartly false. Photos and videos show apartment building in flames during Minneapolis protests, not police station.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
