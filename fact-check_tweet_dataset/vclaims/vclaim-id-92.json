Example ( here ). This is not true.\n\nThe posts, circulated on social media within the UK, come as the coronavirus outbreak has pushed the country into a lockdown. By March 25, 2020 some 9,529 people had tested positive for the virus in the United Kingdom while 463 patients had died.\n\nCOVID-19 appears to pose a greater threat to people with pre-existing health conditions, including those with respiratory problems like severe asthma (here ). The UK\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) says people with \u201ca severe lung condition, such as cystic fibrosis or severe asthma\u201d are at high risk from the virus (here).\n\nThe false claim posted on social media states: \u201cThose of you with pre-existing respiratory conditions such as COPD or asthma can contact your GP for a \u2018Rescue Pack\u2019. It gives you a 5 day supply of a corticosteroid (prednisolone) and a 5 day supply of an antibiotic (usually amoxicillin or doxycycline) which can be started immediately if you develop any breathing issues.\n\nA large number of UK general practices have released statements on their websites and social media pages confirming that this is false.\n\nIn one such statement, London\u2019s Lower Clapton Health Centre said on its website (here\n\n\u201cWe have been made aware of some inaccurate information circulating regarding special \u2018rescue packs\u2019 for patients with pre-existing respiratory conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\nPlease do not contact your GP practice for a rescue pack. You should continue to manage your condition in the usual way and if you feel you have symptoms of COVID-19, go to 111.nhs.uk/covid-19 before doing anything else.\u201d\n\nIn response to the posts, health officials (here and here ) have clarified that some people have previously been given rescue packs \u2013 but these were to manage flare ups of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as part of an agreed management plan. \u201cThey are not currently recommended as a routine treatment in patients with Covid-19 (Coronavirus),\u201d the The Health and Social Care Board (HSCB) of Northern Ireland states on its website.\n\nThe charity Asthma UK said that it was aware of the messages circulating on social media, and stressed that the packs are not recommended as standard for people with asthma. \"If someone\u2019s asthma is bad enough to consider steroids it is essential they are assessed by a healthcare professional. Even at this busy time for the NHS, getting early support for any problems with your lungs is critical to keep you well and out of hospital,\u201d it said on its Facebook page (here).\n\nThe NHS East Lancashire Clinical Commissioning Group urged people to \u201cfollow official guidance\u201d and to be aware of \u201cfalse information\u201d that is sometimes posted on social media. (here).\n\nFalse: patients cannot receive a \u2018rescue pack\u2019 from their GP if they have pre-existing respiratory conditions such as asthma and COPD, unless previously prescribed as part of an agreement management plan.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
