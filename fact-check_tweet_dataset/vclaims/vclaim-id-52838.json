EEOC, the Department of Justice argued that employers should be allowed to force female employees to wear skirts, if the employer was Christian.\n\nThe DOJ's argument would equally allow employers to require male employees to wear suits, trousers, ties, and so on. The DOJ's arguments were not contingent on the religious faith of the employer, and the DOJ did not argue for a religious exemption from non-discrimination law in this court case.\n\nThe DOJ argued that sex-discrimination law allows employers to impose sex-specific dress codes (which could potentially involve requiring women to wear skirts) provided the policy doesn't unfairly burden one sex over the other.\n\nOn Aug. 19, 2019, the left-leaning website Shareblue Media published an article with the headline \u201c[Department of Justice] Says Christian Employers Should Be Allowed to Make Women Wear Skirts,\u201d which reported that:\n\nThis term, the Supreme Court will hear a case, R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), to determine whether trans employees can be fired simply for being trans\u2026Currently, the case is before the Supreme Court, to be heard in the 2019-2020 term, and the government has flipped sides. Last week, the Department of Justice wrote a brief arguing the case that the EEOC won in the appellate court should now be reversed, urging the Court to hand a victory to the Christian funeral home owner. The DOJ\u2019s stance is so appalling that the EEOC refused to sign onto the brief. The argument of Solicitor General Noel Francisco, a Trump nominee, is that Title VII is limited only to discrimination based on \u201cbiological sex\u201d only and therefore doesn\u2019t cover the firing of Stephens for being transgender. Put another way, the DOJ is arguing that Title VII applies when, say, women are treated worse at a job then men are, but not when transgender workers are treated worse at work than non-transgender workers. It gets worse. The DOJ brief endorses the view of the funeral home owner, Thomas Rost, who said \u201cthe Bible teaches that it is wrong for a biological male to deny his sex by dressing as a woman or for a biological female to deny her sex by dressing as a man\u201d and that he would fire any woman who refused to wear a skirt while at work. You read that right. It\u2019s 2019, and the government is arguing that businesses should be allowed to force women to wear skirts at work as long as a Christian business owner demands it.\n\nWe received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of Shareblue\u2019s claim that the DOJ had articulated or supported the view that Christian employers should be legally allowed to force female employees to wear a skirt at work.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court accepted the case in question for consideration in July 2018. As of August 2019, it was scheduled for oral arguments in October. Based on accounts filed by the employer Harris Funeral Homes, the employee Aimee Stephens, and the DOJ, as well as an earlier Court of Appeals opinion, the following is the rough sequence of events at the heart of this important but at times complicated case.\n\nIn 2007, Stephens was hired by Harris Homes, which has three funeral-home locations in Michigan. Stephens had been born biologically male and assigned that gender at birth, was given the name William Anthony Beasley Stephens, and went by \u201cAnthony.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, she informed her employer that she intended to live as a woman, which she had regarded for a long time as her true gender identity, and that as part of that transition, she intended to have gender-reassignment surgery. That would require living and working as a woman for a year first, and Stephens told Harris Homes she would take a vacation, and would \u201creturn to work as [her] true self,\u201d with the intention of presenting herself as a woman and complying with the company\u2019s dress code for women by wearing a skirt and suit jacket at work. Male employees were required to wear a suit and tie.\n\nBefore she took that vacation, the owner of the company, Thomas Rost, terminated Stephens\u2019 employment. Stephens filed a sex-discrimination complaint with the federal Equality Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging that Rost had fired her \u201cdue to her sex and gender identity.\u201d (The EEOC also found the company had discriminated against female employees by providing suits for male workers, free of charge, but not providing an equal allowance to women. Harris Homes changed that particular policy in 2014 and now provides all workers a clothing allowance.)\n\nEEOC and the U.S. District Court\n\nThe EEOC investigated Stephens\u2019 complaint and ultimately decided to apply to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in 2014, seeking an injunction against Harris Funeral Homes. The agency alleged that \u2014 in violation of federal non-discrimination law \u2014 the company had \u201cfired Stephens because Stephens is transgender, because of Stephens\u2019s transition from male to female, and/or because Stephens did not conform to [Harris Homes\u2019] sex- or gender-based preferences, expectations or stereotypes.\u201d\n\nThe company applied to have the case dismissed, but the District Court denied that motion. However, the court said the EEOC could not claim Title VII discrimination (after Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act) solely on the basis of Stephens\u2019 status as a transgender person, because gender identity was not one of the types of discrimination prohibited by law. (They are: race, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability and pregnancy.)\n\nHowever, the District Court said the EEOC could bring a claim that alleged Harris Homes had engaged in impermissible \u201csex stereotyping,\u201d based on the fact that Stephens\u2019 firing was related to her stated intention to not wear the clothes prescribed under the company\u2019s male dress code.\n\nIn the end, the District Court concluded that Harris Homes had indeed engaged in sex discrimination against Stephens on the basis of the \u201csex stereotyping\u201d claim, but said the company was exempt from federal non-discrimination law based on the protections provided through the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1993.\n\nThe EEOC appealed the District Court\u2019s decision before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.\n\nIn March 2018, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court\u2019s ruling, finding that Harris Homes did engage in impermissible \u201csex stereotyping\u201d sex discrimination, and rejecting the company\u2019s claim that sex stereotyping was only impermissible discrimination if it had a disproportionately negative impact on one gender class of employees.\n\nThe court also found that Rost had a legitimate right to a religious objection to employing Stephens, but that even the legislation which codified that constitutional right (RFRA) allowed for \u201cgreater good\u201d exceptions, where the state has an overriding interest in protecting someone from discrimination, which the court saw as being the case here.\n\nThirdly, and perhaps most notably, the Court of Appeals also contradicted the District Court\u2019s ruling that the EEOC could not proceed against Harris Homes on the basis of a \u201cpure\u201d discrimination claim. According to the Court of Appeals, gender identity was, in fact, a grounds for a discrimination claim, under federal non-discrimination laws.\n\n\u201cWe also hold that discrimination on the basis of transgender and transitioning status violates Title VII \u2026 First, it is analytically impossible to fire an employee based on that employee\u2019s status as a transgender person without being motivated, at least in part, by the employee\u2019s sex \u2026 We ask whether Stephens would have been fired if Stephens had been a [biological] woman who sought to comply with the women\u2019s dress code. The answer quite obviously is no. This, in and of itself, confirms that Stephens\u2019s sex impermissibly affected Rost\u2019s decision to fire Stephens.\n\n\u201c\u2026 Second, discrimination against transgender persons necessarily implicates Title VII\u2019s proscriptions against sex stereotyping \u2026 an employer cannot discriminate on the basis of transgender status without imposing its stereotypical notions of how sexual organs and gender identity ought to align. There is no way to disaggregate discrimination on the basis of transgender status from discrimination on the basis of gender non-conformity, and we see no reason to try.\u201d\n\nIn July 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to consider the case and was scheduled to hear oral arguments in early October 2019.\n\nStephens died in May 2020. One month later, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling, saying that federal law did indeed bar employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity as impermissible sex discrimination. The court reached that decision in a 6-3 vote, explicitly taking into account the Harris Funeral Homes case as well as two other similar cases, which we have examined in greater depth elsewhere.\n\nOn Aug. 16, 2019, the DOJ filed a brief before the Supreme Court, arguing on behalf of the federal government that the court should reverse the Court of Appeals decision, thus ruling in favor of Harris Homes and against the EEOC. Despite being the federal respondent to the company\u2019s appeal, the EEOC did not sign on to the government\u2019s (that is, the DOJ\u2019s) Supreme Court brief.\n\nThe District Court based its ruling on several grounds, as did the Court of Appeals, so it\u2019s important to understand the reasons put forward by the DOJ for asking the Supreme Court to reverse the Court of Appeals decision. After all, the DOJ might be calling for the same outcome as the funeral home, but that doesn\u2019t mean they agree on all issues, and they might be advocating the same outcome for differing reasons.\n\nAs outlined in the Aug. 16 brief, the following is a rough summary of the DOJ\u2019s arguments:\n\u2022 The meaning of \u201csex\u201d in the original 1964 Civil Rights act was understood to be biological sex, and Congress has declined to explicitly add transgender status to employment non-discrimination legislation over the years. This means the Court of Appeals was wrong in its claim that federal non-discrimination law does implicitly entail transgender status.\n\u2022 Even if discrimination against a transgender person on the basis of being transgender could be regarded as discrimination on the basis of sex, a claimant must prove that he or she was negatively impacted by that discrimination by comparison with a counterpart of the opposite sex. Since discrimination against transgender persons would negatively impact trans men as much as trans women, this would not be the case. If the Supreme Court accepts that merely considering sex amounts to impermissible sex discrimination, without this element of disproportionate harm, then the court would have to invalidate any and all sex-specific policies, including dress codes and sex-specific bathrooms.\n\u2022 The argument that discrimination based on transgender status inherently requires impermissible sex stereotyping fails because the basis of that precedent, Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, did not involve a declaration that any and all sex stereotyping was impermissible, only that evidence of sex stereotyping could be regarded as de facto evidence of sex discrimination. Furthermore, Stephens hasn\u2019t been able to prove that she was disproportionately negatively impacted by comparison with a member of the opposite sex \u2014 that is, that (in the DOJ\u2019s language) a biological woman would have been allowed to dress under the male dress code.\n\nDid the DOJ say what Shareblue claimed it said?\n\nAs of Aug. 23, oral arguments had not taken place, but so far at least, the DOJ hasn\u2019t argued that \u201cChristian employers should be allowed to make women wear skirts,\u201d as Shareblue\u2019s headline claimed. In fact, the \u201creligious objection\u201d exemption that the District Court afforded Harris Homes and its owner Rost has not formed part of the DOJ\u2019s arguments.\n\n\u201cThe DOJ brief endorses the view of the funeral home owner, Thomas Rost, who said \u2018the Bible teaches that it is wrong for a biological male to deny his sex by dressing as a woman or for a biological female to deny her sex by dressing as a man\u2019 and that he would fire any woman who refused to wear a skirt while at work.\u201d\n\nThat is not accurate. The DOJ brief mentions the fact that Rost said this, but does not endorse that view. The actual point the DOJ makes about this, which Shareblue omitted, is that the fact Rost would be equally willing to fire both a biological man and biological woman who both refused to dress under the dress code of their assigned gender shows (in the DOJ\u2019s opinion) that the policy does not favor one sex over the other, meaning it is permissible under federal non-discrimination law.\n\nThe DOJ has not endorsed or supported Rost\u2019s biblically founded viewpoint on gender or attire, nor his company\u2019s specific dress code policy. Rather, the DOJ has quite narrowly and specifically argued that the policy does not unfairly favor or burden workers of one sex over the other, and so does not violate non-discrimination law.\n\nShareblue went on to claim:\n\n\u201cYou read that right. It\u2019s 2019, and the government is arguing that businesses should be allowed to force women to wear skirts at work as long as a Christian business owner demands it.\u201d\n\nThis is very misleading. Again, the DOJ did not make a religious exemption argument in its Supreme Court brief, and its argument that Harris Homes\u2019 dress code does not unfairly burden one sex over the other is not contingent upon the particular religious faith of the employer. So the conditional statement \u201cas long as a Christian business owner demands it,\u201d is a highly misleading representation of what the DOJ has actually argued.\n\nIs the DOJ arguing that any business owner, regardless of religious faith (or absence thereof) \u201cshould be allowed to force women to wear skirts at work\u201d? Not exactly, but the DOJ is arguing that this is what the law already allows, under certain conditions.\n\nThe DOJ is not making an argument from a moral viewpoint, saying what \u201cshould\u201d be allowed and what should not be allowed. As is the norm for briefs before the U.S. Supreme Court, the DOJ is arguing what it perceives existing law to require \u2014 taking into account the text of legislation, the precedents set in past federal court decisions, as well as the intentions and understandings of lawmakers when they wrote the legislation in question. These are legal arguments, not moral ones, and they are arguments based on what the DOJ understands is the case, not what the DOJ thinks should be the case.\n\nIn this particular instance, the DOJ is arguing that the existing body of non-discrimination law does not recognize transgender status as one of the grounds for a \u201cpure\u201d discrimination claim (like race, sex, religion, and so on); and that existing law does not regard a workplace policy as impermissible if it merely takes into account sex, rather than unfairly favoring or burdening one sex over the other.\n\nTherefore, the DOJ is in effect arguing that existing law already allows an employer to impose different dress codes for male and female workers, provided those dress codes don\u2019t unfairly burden or favor one sex over the other. In this narrow sense, Shareblue\u2019s headline has an element of truth \u2014 having different dress codes for men and women could involve obliging female employees to wear skirts (or pantsuits, or scarves, or dresses, and so on.)\n\nBut that headline is woefully incomplete and therefore misleads readers about the DOJ\u2019s actual argument, because having different dress codes for men and women would equally involve obliging male employees to wear trousers, suits, ties, and so on.\n\nSo for Shareblue to cherry-pick only one side of the implications of the DOJ\u2019s argument, by focusing, in its headline, on \u201cwomen\u201d and \u201cskirts,\u201d misleads readers while also missing the very point the DOJ made in that argument: that once the burden from sex-specific policies like dress codes is equally shared by men and women, the law allows that policy.", "lang": "en"}
