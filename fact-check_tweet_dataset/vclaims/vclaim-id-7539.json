Maxine Waters recently been \u201ccharged on 3 counts\u201d? \n\n\n\nA: No. The California Democrat was investigated for ethics violations following a 2008 meeting, but she was found to have broken no rules. \n\n\n\nNearly a decade ago, Rep. Maxine Waters was investigated for potential ethics violations. That inquiry, which concluded more than five years ago, found that she had not broken any congressional rules, laws, or regulations.\n\nBut, several dubious websites have posted a story that picked up on the old allegations, suggesting that the investigation is recent and ongoing.\n\nThe headline circulating on Facebook says: \u201cCalifornia Democrat Maxine Waters Charged on 3 Counts. Do You Support This?\u201d\n\nAfter readers click on the headline, the story claims: \u201cThe House Ethics Committee has at long last charged Maxine Waters (D-CA) with defilement.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what the story is referring to when it says she was charged with \u201cdefilement.\u201d The subcommittee that investigated Waters alleged three counts of misconduct under these rules:\n\u2022 The first clause of the Code of Official Conduct in the Rules of the House of Representatives, which says members must \u201creflect creditably on the House;\u201d\n\u2022 The third clause of that conduct code, which bars members from using their influence to make money;\n\u2022 The fifth paragraph of the appendix to part 73 of the Code of Ethics For Government Service, which bars government workers from accepting \u201cfavors or benefits.\u201d\n\nAlso, the inquiry was opened in 2009 and concluded in 2012, according to the final report, so the story\u2019s claim that the committee has \u201cat long last\u201d charged the congresswoman isn\u2019t accurate.\n\nThe situation that led to the years-long investigation dates back to 2008, when Waters arranged a meeting between Henry Paulson, who was the treasury secretary at the time, and the National Bankers Association, which represents minority-owned banks. According to the initial report from the Office of Congressional Ethics in 2009, though, the primary focus of the meeting, and the follow-up afterwards, was on one particular bank, OneUnited Bank, where Waters\u2019 husband had previously been on the board of directors and was, at the time, a stockholder.\n\nThe investigation of potential ethical violations concluded that Waters did not violate any rules or laws, because she didn\u2019t know that OneUnited would figure so prominently in the meeting that she arranged.\n\n\u201cRepresentative Waters reasonably believed she was arranging the Treasury meeting on behalf of a broad class of minority banks, and that in doing so she did not violate any House rule, law, regulation, or other applicable standard of conduct,\u201d the final report said.\n\nThe committee did, however, issue a letter of reproval to Waters\u2019 chief of staff, Mikael Moore, for his role in facilitating help for OneUnited. Moore is also her grandson.\n\nWhen the recent story mentioning the investigation showed up on Facebook, users of the social media site flagged it as potentially false.\n\nIt\u2019s true that there was an investigation, but the story is misleading since it never discloses that the investigation concluded with a finding that Waters didn\u2019t violate any rules.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nU.S. House of Representatives Committee on Ethics.
