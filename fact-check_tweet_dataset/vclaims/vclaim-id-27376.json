This is the complicated \u2014 and somewhat contradictory \u2014 state of the American economy that President Trump painted over with a big smiley face at the Economic Club of New York on Tuesday.\n\nIn remarks and a question-and-answer session, Mr. Trump continued to portray himself as a savior of what had been a moribund economy, trumpeting job gains and increased worker pay on his watch. To support his claims, he unleashed a flurry of economic statistics. Some were accurate, some were misleading and some appear nowhere close to the truth.\n\nHere are some of the president\u2019s claims.\n\nWhat the president said\n\n\u201cWe are winning\u201d World Trade Organization \u201ccases for the first time.\u201d\n\nThe United States is a member of the World Trade Organization, which adjudicates disputes between nations in global trade. Mr. Trump claimed that before he took office, the organization never ruled in favor of America in those disputes: \u201cThey would rule against us because they said: \u2018Hey, don\u2019t worry about the United States. They are the stupid people. Don\u2019t worry. Rule against them.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe World Trade Organization\u2019s history of decisions shows this to be untrue. The United States usually prevails in cases that it brings before the global body.", "lang": "en"}
