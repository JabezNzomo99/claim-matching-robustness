This photographic brouhaha soon mutated into a (false) claim that Barack Obama \u201crefused to put his hand over his heart during the Pledge of Allegiance\u201d and then into the (even more false) claim that \u201che refused to recite the Pledge of Allegiance\u201d at all (rumors which the Obama campaign soon provided evidence to negate).\n\nWhile this controversy was all the rage on the Internet, political columnist John Semmens included a bit at the end of one of his satirical \u201cSemi-News\u201d columns (found on the web site of The Arizona Conservative) offering a mock explanation from Senator Obama about his non-hand-over-heart stance, poking fun at the candidate by having him voice the opinion that \u201cthe American flag is a symbol of oppression\u201d and that the anthem is too \u201cbellicose\u201d and should be replaced by something gentler like \u201cI\u2019d Like to Teach the World to Sing\u201d:\n\nHot on the heels of his explanation for why he no longer wears a flag pin, presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama was forced to explain why he doesn\u2019t follow protocol when the National Anthem is played. According to the United States Code, Title 36, Chapter 10, Sec. 171, During rendition of the national anthem when the flag is displayed, all present except those in uniform are expected to stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said about the flag pin, I don\u2019t want to be perceived as taking sides,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThere are a lot of people in the world to whom the American flag is a symbol of oppression. And the anthem itself conveys a war-like message. You know, the bombs bursting in air and all. It should be swapped for something less parochial and less bellicose. I like the song \u2018I\u2019d Like to Teach the World to Sing.\u2019 If that were our anthem, then I might salute it.\u201d\n\nThis bit of satire evidently came off as too believable to some readers, as it was excerpted from Semmens\u2019 column and forwarded via (without attribution) as a genuine statement from Senator Obama. However topical it might have been, it was just a bit of political commentary-cum-humor, not Barack Obama\u2019s own words.\n\nIn September 2008, this same piece began arriving in our inbox with extra text supposedly quoting Barack Obama on his plans to \u201cdisarm America\u201d and \u201cend hostilities\u201d with Islamic nations, headed by the claim that it was derived from the 2008 airing of Meet the Press and naming the interviewer as \u201cGeneral Bill Ginn, USAF (ret.)\u201d:\n\nYes, he told us in advance what he planned to do. Few were listening. The following is a narrative taken from a 2008 Sunday morning televised \u201cMeet The Press\u2019. From Sunday\u2019s 07 Sept. 2008 11:48:04 EST, Televised \u201cMeet the Press\u201d the THEN Senator Obama was asked about his stance on the American Flag. General Bill Gann\u2019 USAF (ret.) asked Obama to explain WHY he doesn\u2019t follow protocol when the National Anthem is played. The General stated to Obama that according to the United States Code, Title 36, Chapter 10, Sec. 171\u2026 During rendition of the national anthem, when the flag is displayed, all present (except those in uniform) are expected to stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart. Or, at the very least, \u201cStand and Face It\u201d. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said about the flag pin, I don\u2019t want to be perceived as taking sides\u201d. \u201cThere are a lot of people in the world to whom the American flag is a symbol of oppression.\u201d \u201cThe anthem itself conveys a war-like message. You know, the bombs bursting in air and all that sort of thing.\u201d Obama continued: \u201cThe National Anthem should be \u2018swapped\u2019 for something less parochial and less bellicose. I like the song \u2018I\u2019d Like To Teach the World To Sing\u2019. If that were our anthem, then, I might salute it. In my opinion, we should consider reinventing our National Anthem as well as \u2018redesign\u2019 our Flag to better offer our enemies hope and love. It\u2019s my intention, if elected, to disarm America to the level of acceptance to our Middle East Brethren. If we, as a Nation of warring people, conduct ourselves like the nations of Islam, where peace prevails \u2014 perhaps a state or period of mutual accord could exist between our governments \u2026\u201d When I become President, I will seek a pact of agreement to end hostilities between those who have been at war or in a state of enmity, and a freedom from disquieting oppressive thoughts. We as a Nation, have placed upon the nations of Islam, an unfair injustice which is WHY my wife disrespects the Flag and she and I have attended several flag burning ceremonies in the past\u201d. \u201cOf course now, I have found myself about to become the President of the United States and I have put my hatred aside. I will use my power to bring CHANGE to this Nation, and offer the people a new path. My wife and I look forward to becoming our Country\u2019s First black Family. Indeed, CHANGE is about to overwhelm the United States of America \u201d\n\nIt goes without saying that Senator Obama wasn\u2019t among the guests on that day\u2019s Meet the Press program (which featured Senator Joe Biden and author Tom Friedman), nor did he make the comments attributed to him on that show or in any other forum. (Later versions of the message also falsely attributed its authorship to Dale Lindsborg of the Washington Post.)\n\nThe following (also fabricated) statement about flag burning purportedly made by Barack Obama was appended to later versions of the", "lang": "en"}
