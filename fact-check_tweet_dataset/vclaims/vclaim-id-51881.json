(Be careful when you\u2019re generous because there are plenty of such beggars).\u201d In the video, a man approaches a shopkeeper saying that he wants to give away the extra ration that has been donated to him in exchange for items such as soap and shampoo. He claims that he has ration for at least 3-4 months.\n\nAdditional SP of UP police Rahul Srivastav shared the video cautioning people to be careful while donating supplies to the hungry and needy.\n\nAlt News has also received several requests to fact-check this on WhatsApp (+91 76000 11160) and on our official Android application.\n\nAlt News analysed the viral video using InVid and performed a reverse image search but there were no results. However, a few packets with the words \u2018Shan Pilau Biryani\u2019 written in Urdu are visible in the clip. We found that Shaan Foods is a company based in Karachi, Pakistan.\n\nTaking this as a clue, we searched for the video on Facebook with specific Urdu keywords and found a post from April 7, 2020, uploaded by Pakistani channel Pak TV24.\n\nProducts of Shan Foods are exported across the world including India. However, the packaging is different. In Pakistan (top), the company uses Urdu but in the rest of South Asia all information is written in English (bottom). Shan Foods is also available on Indian e-commerce websites like Amazon, India Mart, etc. Therefore, a video from Pakistan was shared by several Indian social media users including an Additional SP of Uttar Pradesh police, cautioning people in India to be careful while donating essential items to the needy.", "lang": "en"}
