On November 28, Uddhav Thackeray was sworn-in as the chief minister of Maharastra after getting elected as the head of Maha Vikas Aghadi, the alliance of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress.\n\nTwitter handle @ugtunga also posted the same claim, \u201cSo Supriya Sule, daughter of Sharad Pawar is the wife of Sadanand Balachandra Sule who happens to be the son of Sudha Balachandra Sule who is the sister of late Bala Saheb Thackeray. Uff\u2026!! This relationships, I can never understand.\u201d The tweet has garnered more than 1,000 retweets so far.\n\nIn another tweet, the handle posted an article by Dainik Bhaskarpublished on June 30, 2016. The article stated that Sadanand Sule, the husband of Supriya Sule is the nephew of late Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray.\n\nRecently, three more media outlets \u2013 News18, The Lallantop, and Asianet News Hindi \u2013 have published reports where it is being claimed that the husband of Supriya Sule, Sadanand Sule, is a nephew of Bal Thackeray.\n\nWith a Google search, we found that Sadanand Sule, the husband of Supriya Sule, is the son of former Mahindra and Mahindra Managing Director Bhalchandra R. Sule. In an obituary of Bhalchandra Sule published on the official website of Mahindra, it is stated that Bhalchandra Sule\u2019s wife name is Anne Sule.\n\nWhile the name of Bal Thackeray\u2019s sister is Sudha Sule, the name of Supriya Sule\u2019s mother-in-law is Anne Sule. According to an Economic Times profile of companies, Mrs Anne Bhalchnadra Sule was on the list of current board members and directors of KLM Engineering Co Ltd.\n\nHowever, Bhalchandra Sule\u2019s first wife was Shashi Bhatt, who died when Sadanand Sule was just two years old. Bhatt\u2019s name is mentioned in the book, Contemporary Political Leadership in India: Sharad Pawar, the Maratha legacy by S.R Bakshi, Sita Ram Sharam, and S. Gajrani. \u201cSadanand\u2019s mother, Shashi Bhatt, was a badminton singles and doubles champion in her time. Her father, M. D. Bhatt, I.C.S. rose to become Chief Secretary of the composite Bombay State. Shashi died in 1964 of cancer, when Sadanand was just two years old.\u201d\n\nIn November 2012, Supriya Sule expressed her grief over the death of Bal Thackeray and deemed it a personal loss to the family. She said , \u201c\u0915\u0940 \u0939\u092e\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u0924\u094b \u092b\u0948\u092e\u093f\u0932\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u0902\u092c\u0902\u0927 \u0925\u0947\u0964 \u091c\u092c\u0938\u0947 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092a\u0948\u0926\u093e \u0939\u0941\u0908 \u0924\u092c\u0938\u0947 \u096a\u0966 \u0938\u093e\u0932 \u0938\u0947 \u0920\u093e\u0915\u0930\u0947 \u0914\u0930 \u092a\u0935\u093e\u0930 \u095e\u0948\u092e\u093f\u0932\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u092c\u095c\u0940 \u0905\u091a\u094d\u091b\u0940 \u0926\u094b\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0940 \u0925\u0940\u0964 \u0924\u094b \u0939\u092e\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u0924\u094b \u0938\u093f\u0930\u094d\u092b \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930, \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0915\u0947 \u090f\u0915 \u0932\u0940\u0921\u0930 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902, \u092a\u0930\u094d\u0938\u0928\u0932 \u0932\u094b\u0938\u094d\u0938 \u0939\u092e\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u092b\u0945\u092e\u093f\u0932\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u0939\u0941\u0935\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0964 \u0915\u0940 \u0939\u092e\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u0907\u0926\u0947\u0913\u0932\u0949\u091c\u093f\u0915\u0932 \u0921\u093f\u092b\u0930\u0947\u0902\u0938 \u091c\u0930\u0942\u0930 \u0939\u094b\u0902\u0917\u0947\u0964 \u0932\u0947\u0915\u093f\u0928 \u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u092b\u093e\u0926\u0930 \u0914\u0930 \u092c\u093e\u0932\u093e\u0938\u093e\u0939\u0947\u092c \u0915\u0940 \u0926\u094b\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0940 \u092c\u094b\u0939\u094b\u0924 \u0939\u0940 \u0938\u093e\u0932\u094b\u0902 \u0938\u0947 \u0906\u0924\u0940 \u0930\u0939\u0940 \u0939\u0948\u0964 \u0907\u0938\u0932\u093f\u090f \u0939\u092e\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u0924\u094b \u090f\u0915 \u092c\u095c\u093e \u092a\u0930\u094d\u0938\u0928\u0932 \u0932\u094b\u0938\u094d\u0938 \u0939\u0948\u0964 We had family relations. Since the time I was born, from the last 40 years, Thackeray and Pawar family had cordial relations. Hence for us, it\u2019s not just a loss of Maharastra\u2019s or a country\u2019s leader, it\u2019s a personal loss to the family. We surely might have had ideological differences but my father friendship with Balasaheb has been going-on from many years. Thus, it\u2019s a big personal loss for us. (-translated)\u201d\n\nWe also found a 2013 interview of Sanjeevan Karandikar, the sister of Bal Thackeray. At 1:20 mins in the News 18 Lokmat interview, she can be heard saying that when their sister had passed away, Balasaheb had said to her that now only two of us are left. Mrs Karandikar later grieves that when Balasaheb died she said to herself that she is alone now. In the interview, she refers to four elder sisters, two elder brothers and one younger brother excluding herself. Hence, her elder sister Sudha Sule is no more.\n\nFurthermore, Alt News contacted journalist Dhaval Kulkarni, who penned the book: \u201cThe Cousins Thackeray: Uddhav, Raj and the Shadow of their Senas\u201d, regarding the claim viral on social media. Rubbishing the claim, He said, \u201cBalasaheb had six sisters, of which five were elder to him. However, of Prabhodhankar Thackeray\u2019s 10 children, only one survives. Namely, Sanjeevani Karandikar, who is 80+. His eldest sister\u2019s name was Sudha Sule, but she is not Supriya\u2019s mother in law. I have double-checked this with the family\u201d.\n\nIn a conversation with Alt News, Shiv Sena\u2019s deputy leader Priyanka Chaturvedi also refuted the claim and took a jibe at the opposition by saying, \u201cThis is absolutely incorrect and not true. In the past few days, we have seen how Shiv Sena has been the target of fake propaganda, which clearly points to an agenda of our opponents. They are clearly rattled with the coming together of Maha Vikas Aghadi that thwarted them from an attempt to subvert the constitution and democracy as we know it\u201d.\n\nThus, the claim that NCP leader Supriya Sule\u2019s mother-in-law is the sister of Bal Thackeray is false. The name of Supriya Sule\u2019s mother-in-law is Anne Sule and not Sudha Sule as claimed on social media.", "lang": "en"}
