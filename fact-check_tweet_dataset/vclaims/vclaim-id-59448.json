What\u2019s the likelihood that the remaining 4.8 million Indiana adults each constitute their own household?\n\nNot likely at all.\n\nWhen we asked the Indiana Department of Revenue how many tax returns are filed annually in the state, they said the number is around 3.2 million, and that includes both joint filers and individuals.\n\nSo clearly Obama was wrong. A White House official confirmed for us that it was a goof, pure and simple. A staffer mistakenly used the number of households in Illinois in Obama's speech, 4.8 million, instead of Indiana, which is 2.4 million.\n\nSo there aren't as many Hoosier households as Obama claimed, and he earns a False on the Truth-O-Meter.", "lang": "en"}
