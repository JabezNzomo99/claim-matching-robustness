(Read our earlier review of the GOP memo.)\n\nWas the Steele dossier \u2018essential\u2019 to authorizing Page surveillance?\n\nThe Democratic memo rebuts the Republican claim that law enforcement officials relied heavily on a controversial document to obtain a surveillance warrant for former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.\n\nAfter convincing a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge that there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power, the FBI and Justice Department obtained a warrant in October 2016, several months after Page parted ways with the campaign.\n\nAccording to the Republican memo, a dossier compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele on behalf of Fusion GPS \u2014 a research firm whose work was funded in part by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign \u2014 \"formed an essential part\" of the Page surveillance application.\n\nThe GOP memo sought to bolster this claim through paraphrased testimony of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. Republicans said McCabe told the House Intelligence Committee in December 2017 that \"no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court) without the Steele dossier information.\"\n\nThe Democratic memo does not rebut McCabe\u2019s testimony directly. However, it claims the Justice Department\u2019s application laid out multiple reasons to surveil Page, and \"made only narrow use\" of the dossier.\n\nThe Democratic memo argues that law enforcement agencies\u2019 interest in Page predates the Steele dossier. That\u2019s consistent with media reports that Page had been on the U.S. counterintelligence radar as early as 2013.\n\nThe memo states that Page was the target of recruiting efforts by Russian spies dating back at least to 2013, and that he was interviewed \"multiple times about his Russian intelligence contacts, including in March 2016\" \u2014 the same month he was named a Trump adviser, and months before FBI investigators obtained Steele\u2019s research in September.\n\nThe Democratic memo is heavily redacted in some places, making it difficult to parse exactly how much officials relied on the Steele dossier. However, it\u2019s clear that the surveillance application drew from the dossier\u2019s account of a Russia trip Page made during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nWhile an adviser to the Trump campaign, Page traveled in July 2016 to Moscow where he met with Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister and a high-ranking Russian oil official. Page reported back to Trump campaign staffers in an email that the deputy prime minister had \"expressed strong support for Mr. Trump,\" and that he had gleaned \"incredible insights and outreach\" in Russia. The Democratic memo references additional meetings Page held during his trip.\n\n\"DOJ cited multiple sources to support the case for surveilling Page,\" the Democratic memo reads. \"But (DOJ) made only narrow use of information from Steele's sources about Page's specific activities in 2016, chiefly his suspected July 2016 meetings in Moscow with Russian officials.\"\n\nThe Democratic memo emphasizes that the intelligence court renewed Page\u2019s surveillance three separate times after granting initial authority in October 2016. To obtain these 90-day extensions, it notes, the Justice Department provided the court additional information through multiple sources that were independent from \u2014 yet also corroborated \u2014 the Steele dossier.\n\n\"The court-approved surveillance of Page allowed FBI to collect valuable intelligence,\" the memo notes. \"The FISA renewals demonstrate that the FBI collected important investigative information and leads by conducting court-approved surveillance.\"\n\nAnother major area of disagreement between the Republican and Democratic memos is whether the political motives behind the Steele dossier were adequately disclosed to the intelligence court.\n\nThe GOP memo complained that while the surveillance application did indicate that \"Steele was working for a named U.S. person,\" it failed to specify that Steele \"was ultimately working on behalf of \u2014 and paid by \u2014 the DNC and Clinton campaign.\"\n\nBut Democrats counter in their memo that obscuring specific identities in this manner is routine practice.\n\n\"DOJ appropriately upheld its longstanding practice of protecting U.S. citizen information by purposefully not 'unmasking' U.S. person and entity names, unless they were themselves the subject of a counterintelligence investigation,\" the Democratic memo reads.\n\nDemocrats also argue the Justice Department \"provided the court with more than sufficient information to understand the political context of Steele's research.\"\n\n\"(The Justice Department) informed the court accurately that Steele was hired by politically-motivated U.S. persons and entities,\" the memo reads, \"and that his research appeared intended for use \u2018to discredit\u2019 Trump\u2019s campaign.\"\n\nThe Democratic memo includes the relevant excerpt from the original Oct. 21, 2016 application to surveil Page:\n\n\"[Steele] was approached by an identified U.S. Person, who indicated to Source #1 [Steele] that a U.S.-based law firm had hired the identified U.S. Person to conduct research regarding Candidate #1\u2019s ties to Russia. (The identified U.S. Person and Source #1 have a long-standing business relationship.) The identified U.S. person hired Source #1 to conduct this research. The identified U.S. Person never advised Source #1 as to the motivation behind the research into Candidate #1\u2019s ties to Russia. The FBI speculates that the identified U.S. Person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1\u2019s campaign .\"", "lang": "en"}
