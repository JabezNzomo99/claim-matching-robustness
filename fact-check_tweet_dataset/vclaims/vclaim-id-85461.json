So the data predate Obamacare, which was enacted in 2013. The study is based on interviews with a national representative sample of 12,279 women in 2006 to 2010 from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG).\n\nIn 2006-2010, among women age 15 to 44 who have ever had sexual intercourse, 81.9 percent had ever taken the pill; 93.4 percent had ever used a condom; 59.6 percent had used withdrawal method; and 18.1 percent had used the rhythm method.\n\nSo a woman having sex regularly and receiving free coverage for her IUD or birth control pills through her employer is counted the same as a woman who had sex only once and used the withdrawal method or used a condom.\n\nWhen advocates use this statistic, they\u2019re using the term \u201cbirth control\u201d as synonymous as \u201ccontraception,\u201d and referring to any method used to prevent pregnancy, regardless of whether it is something that is covered under Obamacare.\n\nPlanned Parenthood said the organization is not using the graphic to illustrate what\u2019s at risk under the specific draft regulation, but to show that efforts to prevent pregnancy is a ubiquitous experience among sexually active women, and that the Trump administration \u201cseems to be acting with a complete disregard for\u201d this shared experience. Spokeswoman Erica Sackin also noted that given the access to contraceptive coverage under Obamacare, the primary method of contraception could have changed since the CDC study.\n\nThe CDC study, \u201calong with a few that showed how women have struggled to afford the cost of birth control, helped illustrate why the increased access under the ACA (and that\u2019s at risk with the Trump rule) is just so important,\u201d Sackin said. \u201cWomen won\u2019t stop trying to prevent pregnancy if this rule goes into effect, they\u2019ll just be less able to have the full range of options to do so. We would argue that the Trump administration\u2019s new rule is fairly cruel in its disregard for what women want, need, or the realities of how they live their lives.\u201d\n\nIn the past, we\u2019ve found issues where reproductive rights advocates used CDC research to make fishy claims about the use of birth control methods. Each time, we\u2019ve awarded Two Pinocchios (here, here, here), because the same underlying issues arise: The statistic is used to refer to contraception coverage under Obamacare, yet the research includes methods of family planning.\n\nThe same issue exists here. Planned Parenthood used the statistic that \u201c99% of sexually active women have used birth control in their lifetime\u201d in a debate over Obamacare coverage and proposed regulations under the Trump administration that would roll back the free contraception. Yet the study, again, includes methods of natural family planning or condom use, neither of which is included in contraceptive coverage.", "lang": "en"}
