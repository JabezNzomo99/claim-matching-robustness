The claim is false; the video actually shows a controlled underwater blasting in Finland in 2012.\n\nThe 56-second clip was posted by an Australia-based Facebook user here on June 9, 2020.\n\nIt has been viewed more than 610,000 times.\n\nAt the eight-second mark, a beam of light can be seen hitting the water, before a series of waves erupt.\n\nThe Facebook post\u2019s caption states: \u201cLightning Strike into a creek in Montana. It boils the water!! Do not swim in thunderstorms.\u201d\n\nThe video was also shared on Facebook here, here, here and here, on Twitter here, here, here and here, and on YouTube here, here and here alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the video in fact shows a controlled underwater blasting in Finland.\n\nA reverse image search on Yandex found an earlier version of the video published here on YouTube in December 2012.\n\nThe Finnish-language caption of the YouTube video translates as: \u201cDrilling piling, part 3: Blasting\u201d, and the caption states: \u201cIn this video, we deepen the waterway.\u201d\n\nThe footage was uploaded by Rannikon Merity\u00f6, a dredging, excavation and beach construction company based in Taivassalo, southwest Finland.\n\nIn an email to AFP on July 30, a spokesperson for Rannikon Merity\u00f6 said: \u201cThe video was shot in the summer of 2012 in Kustavi (southwest Finland). It shows an explosion of an underwater solid rock. This kind of blasting work is part of the services provided by our company. The video has spread around the internet, including to scam sites. However it is a man-made thing not a natural phenomenon.\u201d\n\nThe footage is also featured here on the company\u2019s website and here on its Facebook page, alongside information about underwater mining, excavation and mining.\n\nThe false claim previously circulated online in 2017 and has been debunked by US broadcaster KARE and fact-checking organisation Snopes here and here.", "lang": "en"}
