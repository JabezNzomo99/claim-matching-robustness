In 2017/18 Conservative councils recycled, reused or composted around 49% of their household waste, compared to 36% in Labour councils.\n\nAcross England in 2017/18, around 45% of collected household waste was recycled, reused or composted. Research suggests that variation in recycling rates can\u2019t solely be put down to which party runs your council, though.\n\nHow we worked out the figures\n\nThe data behind these figures is quite complex. Waste collection and disposal are separate responsibilities and these are often split between councils (for example a district council does one and a county council the other), or between councils and waste disposal authorities (where several councils group together to collect or dispose of waste together). Not all of these councils will be run by the same political party though and this can further complicate the process of working out whether one party does more recycling than the other.\n\nIn calculating the headline figures above we\u2019ve focused on those councils responsible for waste disposal as that is the point at which waste is actually recycled. Where different councils manage waste disposal together through waste disposal authorities, we\u2019ve only considered their data if all the constituent councils are from the same party. This is only the case with one of the waste disposal authorities (Merseyside) where each of the five constituent councils are Labour-run.\n\nAs a result, the data doesn\u2019t cover 22 of 70 Labour councils and four of 55 Conservative councils which are responsible for waste disposal.\n\nBut collecting recyclable waste is obviously a necessary step to making sure that waste is recycled, so it\u2019s also possible to do the analysis by focusing on the councils responsible for that part of the process.\n\nAcross Conservative-run councils responsible for collecting household waste, 47% was recycled compared to 36% in Labour-run councils.\n\nThese rates can\u2019t solely be put down to which party runs your council\n\nAlthough the claim is accurate in saying Conservative councils recycle more, research suggests not all of the difference between recycling rates is due to the actions of local authorities.\n\nFor example, a 2011 report from the London Assembly says:\n\n\u201cRecycling rates are the product of a complex interaction of a number of factors. There are some factors that boroughs can do little to influence or change, for example, the profile of local residents, social class and income levels (socio-economic factors), or housing density.\n\n\u201cHowever, other factors such as waste collection, and communication and engagement with residents can be influenced and shaped by local authorities to help boost recycling locally.\u201d\n\nA 2015 report from environmental charity WRAP estimated that factors within a council\u2019s control accounted for between 39% and 65% of the recycling rate variation across regions.", "lang": "en"}
