Does Australia have \"the most secure food security in the world\"? RMIT ABC Fact Check investigates.\n\nMr Littleproud's claim is in the ballpark.\n\nAccording to many studies and experts, Australia enjoys a very high level of food security. The nation produces an abundance of food, exports far more than it needs, and has ample alternative sources of certain foods should they become scarce.\n\nWhile Australia is not the top-ranked or \"most\" food-secure nation in the world, according to some comparisons, it nevertheless has plenty of flexibility in terms of food sources and could switch production priorities to alleviate shortfalls. One international comparison places Australia 12th among 113 nations in terms of food security.\n\nRichard Heath, of the Australian Farm Institute, typified the response of the experts.\n\n\"By the most basic definition \u2014 which is, 'Are we at risk of starving because we cannot feed ourselves?' \u2014 we are so far from that, it's ridiculous,\" he said.\n\n\"When you consider the availability of irrigated-water area, the amount of arable land \u2026 we are a very secure nation in terms of food.\"\n\nWhat does it mean for a nation to be 'food secure'?\n\nFood security is a complex notion that incorporates two fundamental concepts: quantity and quality.\n\nThe first is whether a nation has sufficient sources of food \u2014 whether locally produced or imported \u2014 to sustain its people. The second is whether the people have reliable access to food that is safe to eat, nutritious and affordable.\n\nA nation, for example, may have bountiful supplies of a particular type of food, but insufficiently diverse food sources to provide a consistently nutritious diet.\n\nSimilarly, it may have physical access to food, but its people cannot afford to buy it. Or it may be overly dependent for its needs on imported products, or vulnerable to severe fluctuations in commodity prices.\n\nAll nations commonly have segments of their population that suffer from limited access to safe, affordable and nutritious food. These include the homeless, low-income households, isolated communities or households that struggle to manage daily life challenges.\n\nHaving a high \"food security\" rating (as determined by various theoretical models) implies a nation is able to provide the overwhelming majority of its people, most of the time, with affordable food sources that will nourish them and provide a healthy diet.\n\nThis is a wider concept that takes into account issues about who controls the primary sources of food and its associated distribution systems: ownership structures, economic power bases and the policies that underpin a nation's food supply chain.\n\nFood sovereignty incorporates cultural preferences about what kinds of food are produced, how they are farmed and what goes into their production.\n\nMr Heath, the executive director of the Australian Farm Institute, a policy research group focused on the agriculture sector, said some organisations and individuals commonly misappropriated the term \"security\" when they were really arguing about \"food sovereignty\".\n\nHe described the latter as \"where what you eat is all produced in the nation\", and said references to \"food security\" sometimes took on political overtones in Australia.\n\nFact Check has examined the concept of \"food security\" by applying a broad interpretation, assessing \"food security\" based on globally-used definitions for nutrition and affordable access to food, while also taking into account vulnerability to food shortfalls or supply-chain disruption.\n\nAn abiding duty of governments is to ensure that their citizens are protected and safe, a concept that includes having sufficient food to sustain the population's daily needs. A nation that cannot feed its people is potentially vulnerable to political instability.\n\nConversely, political instability and regional hostilities can lead to food shortages if daily production is disrupted or crops are destroyed.\n\nOccasionally, local shortages may arise due to drought, floods or pestilence that curb production and disrupt the usual supply of one or more types of vegetables, fruits, grains or meats to consumer markets.\n\nMarket forces or government intervention can assist to ensure alternative foods or alternative sources of supplies are made available.\n\nIn a globalised trading world, many elements of Australia's food production and packaging depend on imported goods, such as machinery, certain types of fertilisers and some types of packaging.\n\nA break in this supply chain could disrupt the ability of local producers ultimately to meet demand. But experts say this would not be catastrophic to Australia's food sustainability.\n\nGlobal concerns about food security were heightened in the early 1970s after drought, storms and floods ravaged developing nations in eastern Africa and heavily-populated Bangladesh.\n\nAt the same time, political upheaval and the trend towards collectivised agriculture deterred large-scale food production in India, Chile, Peru and some other nations.\n\nRapid population growth, inflation, black market profiteering and mismanagement of government-owned stockpiles resulted in extreme food shortages.\n\nThe crisis led to a global summit in Rome in 1974 where delegates to the World Food Conference set a highly ambitious goal of eradicating hunger everywhere.\n\nThe World Food Summit of 1996 confirmed the failure of that goal, but set new commitments and an action plan focusing on the concept of \"undernourishment\".\n\nAs part of these deliberations, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) defined food security as:\n\nThe FAO noted four dimensions to food security:\n\u2022 Availability \u2014 food is actually available through food production, stock levels and trade;\n\u2022 Access \u2014 people have economic and physical access to food (aspects that centre on prices, market forces and income levels);\n\u2022 Utilisation \u2014 there is good biological utilisation of food through preparation and feeding practices, diversity of diet and intra-household distribution;\n\u2022 Stability \u2014 there is long-term stability of the above three factors.\n\nFact Check examined three key sources to determine the extent of Australia's food security.\n\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit compiles extensive country-based research and statistics on a broad range of economic and policy areas.\n\nAs well as nourishment, availability and affordability aspects of food security, its Global Food Security Index takes account of the natural resources and resilience of a country.\n\nThe index also considers structural changes that may affect a nation's ability to feed its people.\n\nThe EIU's Global Food Security Index ranked Australia 12th out of 113 countries in December 2019, based on an overall score of 81.4 out of 100. Australia sat below Singapore (87.4), Ireland (84) and the US (83.7), as well as seven other European nations and Canada.\n\nAlthough Singapore is the top-ranking nation for \"food security\", it imports most of its food and has little access to arable land. The Singapore Food Agency concedes the nation's food supply chain \"remains vulnerable to external shocks\".\n\nPut another way, should Singapore have to close its borders to all civilian and cargo movements, it would soon run out of food.\n\nThis highlights the confusion over \"food security\", which is measured in terms of the food that is available to a nation, and \"food sovereignty\", which includes concepts about control of the food chain.\n\nThe EIU ranked Australia seventh for affordability of food and 10th in terms of availability of food.\n\nOn the quality and safety of its food, Australia came in at number 20, behind the Scandinavian countries and most western European nations.\n\nThe FAO's latest statistical reports indicate that Australia, like countries in North America and Europe, ranks highly in terms of food security.\n\nThe FAO considers food security \u2014 or rather, insecurity \u2014 in terms of the proportion of a nation's population that does not have access to safe, nutritious and affordable food.\n\nThe organisation's assessment is that a relatively low percentage of Australia's population experiences severe or moderate-to-severe food insecurity, placing it among the most food secure nations in the world.\n\nNevertheless, the FAO found that an increasing number of people in Australia struggled to obtain reliable, safe, nutritious and affordable food.\n\nIndeed, the number of Australians said to be suffering from severe \"food insecurity\" has risen from about 600,000 in 2014-16 (calculated as a three-year average) to about 900,000 in 2016-2018, while as much as 13 per cent of the population has a moderate degree of food insecurity.\n\nA review published in early 2019 by Deakin University researchers also found significant variation in the way food insecurity was measured (or determined) within Australia \u2014 an outcome that, in their view, suggested the prevalence and severity of food insecurity was under-reported inside Australia.\n\nA separate study by Max Roser of Oxford University and Hannah Ritchie of the University of Edinburgh, which examined data on food security rates worldwide, suggested Australia's undernourishment rate may be closer to 3.5 per cent of the population, and that as many as 3 million Australians experience moderate to severe food insecurity at some stage.\n\n3. Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES)\n\nABARES is the science and research division of the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment.\n\nIt provides detailed analysis and production forecasts for various industries, including agriculture, fishing, forestry, climate and drought biosecurity and food demand.\n\nOn April 17, ABARES published an analysis of Australia's food security in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It concluded that concerns about food security in Australia were \"understandable, but misplaced\".\n\nABARES found the nation produces substantially more food than it consumes.\n\nAustralia exports about 70 per cent of its agricultural production (by volume), including 71 per cent of its wheat crop, 75 per cent of beef and veal production, and 40 per cent of its dairy products.\n\nIn turn, about 11 per cent by value (not volume) of food and beverages consumed in Australia comes from overseas.\n\nABARES said it was \"unlikely, but possible\" that COVID-19 restrictions could temporarily disrupt supply chains of imported foodstuffs.\n\nThat may cause \"inconvenience\" to some consumers, but ABARES said it would not jeopardise the nation's overall food security.\n\nABARES researchers noted, however, that shortages or disruptions to supply chains for products used by Australian agricultural producers (such as fertilisers, seed variants, machinery and so forth) could affect the volume of output and profits for local food producers.\n\nIn a subsequent, more detailed report, ABARES said that although disruptions in international markets \"may affect the choice and cost of some items, it will not have a material impact on overall food availability\".\n\n\"There may be disruptions to some industries, but the sheer volume of Australia's food production relative to the needs of the domestic population mean domestic food supplies will not fall short,\" the researchers concluded.\n\n\"Despite temporary shortages of some food items in supermarkets caused by an unexpected surge in demand, Australia does not have a food security problem.\"\n\nThe volume and availability of rice in Australia has garnered particular attention in recent weeks amid concerns about potentially lower world production and constraints on the rice trade due to pandemic restrictions imposed by some rice-producing nations.\n\nSevere drought in South-East Asia especially affected Thailand and Vietnam, two of the top three rice exporting nations by volume.\n\nYet the world's biggest exporter, India, enjoyed favourable rice-growing conditions and has increased the area of land under plantation. It is expected to produce a record crop of more than 117 million tonnes in 2019-20 and one similarly large next year, although COVID-19 civilian movement restrictions may crimp production outcomes.\n\nLabour shortages in some countries due to restrictions on civilian movement, has led the US Department of Agriculture to clip its forecast for 2019-20 global rice production to 496.1 million tonnes, about 0.5 per cent below last year's record high.\n\nAs well, trade restrictions imposed by some South-East Asian nations that export significant quantities of rice could curb the volume of rice traded internationally.\n\nThe USDA's April 2020 forecast suggests traded rice volumes in 2020 are likely to be about 5 per cent below last year.\n\nVietnam, for example, temporarily banned most exports of rice in March as part of concerns about its population's food security during the pandemic.\n\nOn April 28, it began to ease pandemic-related export restrictions and planned to recommence rice exports fully this month.\n\nAlso, the USDA noted in its April 9 bulletin that global supplies of rice (and wheat) are \"at record levels and are large enough to meet global demand\".\n\nAustralia is a relatively minor player in the world rice market, representing about 2 per cent by volume of internationally-traded rice.\n\nThe Ricegrowers' Association of Australia says that in a non-drought year, about 80 per cent of the local crop is exported.\n\nIn the 13 years to 2017-18, including several drought-affected years, local rice-growers produced an average of 575,000 tonnes, and exported about half that amount. ABARES' figures on the rice industry indicate Australian consumers demand (on average) 297,000 tonnes a year, a mix of imported varieties and locally-produced rice. Local demand has been increasing steadily for more than a decade.\n\nSeveral years of drought in eastern Australia's prime rice-growing regions have severely affected domestic production, due to a lack of water and high prices for traded water.\n\nProduction for 2019 was estimated to be 54,000 tonnes, or less than 10 per cent of the long-term average.\n\nThe Ricegrowers' Association of Australia, which lobbies on behalf of domestic producers, criticised the ABARES food security report as \"misleading\" in terms of the rice sector.\n\nIt said the security of Australia's rice supplies remained in question due to the combined effects of drought and constraints on exports by some countries.\n\nIt argued that another \"extremely small\" Australian rice crop was likely unless more water was \"made available at cheaper prices between now and the 2020 rice-planting window in October\".\n\nLocal rice producers and growers of irrigated crops have called on the state and federal governments to make more water available to them from the Murray-Darling Basin.\n\nABARES researchers, though, say locally-grown rice is only a \"modest\" contributor to the notion of food security in Australia.\n\nIn its April 23 report, ABARES rejected the call to divert water to rice and other irrigated crops.\n\n\"Calls to divert water or other inputs to the production of crops such as rice would only create additional costs for other agricultural producers or to the environment, while doing nothing to increase the supply in the short run since the growing season for rice has past [sic],\" ABARES researchers said.\n\nWhat do other experts say?\n\nBill Bellotti, the food systems program director for the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland, said the recent panic buying in grocery stores is a consumer-demand issue. It did not stem from problems with the production of food or Australia's capacity to produce food.\n\n\"Food security, for most people, depends on the familiar food supply chain \u2014 producing, processing, distributing and consuming food,\" Professor Bellotti said.\n\nHe suggested the real bottleneck during the COVID-19 crisis had been in the retail chain.\n\n\"The big retailers had food in their distribution centres but could not re-stock fast enough to meet panic demand,\" he said.\n\n\"The pandemic is forcing a rethink on the resilience of these global connections and the 'just-in-time' food supply chains.\n\nProfessor Bellotti said this opportunity for reflecting was available to everyone, including consumers.\n\n\"For example, consumers might consider buying local fresh produce over imported or highly-processed food. Consumers might reduce food waste.\n\nRichard Heath, of the Australian Farm Institute, said Australia did not have a problem with food security.\n\n\"By the most basic definition \u2014 which is, 'Are we at risk of starving because we cannot feed ourselves?' \u2014 we are so far from that, it's ridiculous,\" he said.\n\n\"When you consider the availability of irrigated-water area, the amount of arable land \u2026 we are a very secure nation in terms of food.\n\n\"But the language of food security has become politicised in Australia. It has come to mean that, due to a particular set of policy settings and market mechanisms, we do not have certain industries [thriving] \u2014 think about rice and dairy.\n\n\"We are food secure, but policy and market settings mean that from time to time, we are not secure [in certain products] \u2026 [although] we can very easily substitute it for something else.\"\n\u2022 ABC News, Scott Morrison says panic buying driven by coronavirus lockdown fears is \u2018ridiculous\u2019 and \u2018unAustralian\u2019, March 18, 2020\n\u2022 Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Research Economics and Sciences (ABARES), Agricultural commodities and trade data, 2019 \u2013 Rural commodities - rice\n\u2022 ABARES, Analysis of Australia\u2019s food security and the COVID-19 pandemic\n\u2022 Banger, M.
