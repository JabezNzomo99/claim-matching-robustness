Facebook users flagged the posts as being potentially fake, as part of the social media giant\u2019s efforts to stamp out fake news on its website.\n\nThe stories are all essentially identical, saying authorities stopped Obama (wearing a fake moustache!) as he was trying to fly out of Toronto\u2019s airport to an unspecified destination. He was allegedly taken back to Washington, where \"a court reporter who also moonlights for Breitbart\" secretly took the photograph.\n\nThe photo \"shows\" Obama\u2019s head clearly Photoshopped onto someone else\u2019s body. That someone is actually Robert Halderman, a former CBS News producer who in 2009 was accused \u2014 and later convicted \u2014 of attempting to extort late-night TV host David Letterman.\n\nFormer CBS News producer Robert Halderman was arraigned in State Supreme Court in New York on Oct. 2, 2009, on charges of trying to blackmail late-night host David Letterman. (AP photo)\n\nKeyed to President Donald Trump\u2019s unproven allegations that Obama had wiretapped the billionaire\u2019s phones, the story is originally from a site full of faux news stories, TheLastLineOfDefense.org.\n\nPolitiFact has rated other fake stories we\u2019ve traced back to the site, including one that said Trump was giving all working Americans $612 and another that claimed that an anti-Trump speech by Meryl Streep cost the actress a job.\n\nTheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn\u2019t identify the Obama story as fake, but the About Us page notes that \"all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.\" There\u2019s no indication on other websites that the image is a joke.\n\nWhile you don\u2019t have to be a digital forensics expert to tell the photo is a fake, it\u2019s clear after some digging that the claim is fraudulent.\n\nWe rate it Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
