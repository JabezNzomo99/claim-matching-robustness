In Practice, There Is\u2019?)\n\nThough he made numerous quotable comments during his lifetime, the Daily Caller found no record of Ali ever making the statement. An internet search turned up no instances of him saying the expression in interviews. It doesn\u2019t appear on his verified Twitter account or in his autobiographies either.\n\n\u201cThe Muhammad Ali misattribution occurred because he was featured prominently in an Adidas ad blitz, and sometimes the words were printed on his picture,\u201d writes the website Quote Investigator.\n\nIndeed, sportswear company Adidas employed a longer version of the statement in its 2004 \u201cImpossible is Nothing\u201d brand advertising campaign. The entire \u201cmanifesto,\u201d which was superimposed onto or adjacent to images of well-known athletes, reads:\n\n\u201cImpossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in the world they\u2019re given than to explore the power they have to change it. Impossible is not a fact. It\u2019s an opinion. Impossible is not a declaration. It\u2019s a dare. Impossible is potential. Impossible is temporary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe true creators were ad copy professionals,\u201d Quote Investigator further explains.\n\nAimee Lehto Schewe, a copywriter who worked on the campaign, coined the specific statement attributed to Ali in this Facebook post as part of the campaign\u2019s longer \u201cmanifesto,\u201d according to her website.\n\n\u201cIt continues to resonate and get passed around on the internet, quoted by celebrities, and misattributed to Muhammad Ali,\u201d writes Lehto Schewe. \u201cWhich is super flattering! But also a little frustrating. But mostly great!\u201d\n\nAli\u2019s daughter Laila, also a world champion boxer, appeared in the ad campaign too.", "lang": "en"}
