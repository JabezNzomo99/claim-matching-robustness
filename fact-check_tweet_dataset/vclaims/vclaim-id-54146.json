This is yet another scam: there is no trace of this offer on Samsung\u2019s official social media pages and the South Korean tech giant told AFP Fact Check it had no ties to the give-away.\n\n\u201cSAMSUNG HOT GIVE AWAY FOR STUDENTS,\u201d reads the post. \u201cCongratulations to our previous 30,000 students, who got their phone this morning. Here is another chance for another set of 60,000 people to win brand new samsung new Phones. Win brand new samsung phone of your choice today (sic).\u201d\n\nArchived here, the post has racked up more than 10,000 shares and seen thousands of interactions since June 27, 2020. Similar claims were also shared on Facebook groups in South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and Malawi.\n\nHowever, this page is a bogus account and unrelated to Samsung, which has 120 million likes on its official Facebook page. An email response from the company\u2019s headquarters to AFP Fact Check said that \u201cthe event is not related to Samsung\u201d.\n\nHow does the scam work?\n\nFacebook users are asked to type \u201cSamsung\u201d in the comment section below the post.\n\nOnce this is done, users are instructed to send a direct message with their contact details, including an address, to receive their free phone.\n\nThe page transparency information provided by Facebook shows that the bogus page was created with the name \u201cAngelBozy.com\u201d on October 25, 2016, and then changed to \u201cSaamsung electr0nic pr0m0 com\u201d on May 24, 2020.\n\nAnother interesting detail about the bogus account is that it is managed from Nigeria, a country not listed in the page transparency section for Samsung.\n\nA web address in the bogus page\u2019s \u201cAbout\u201d section redirects to a broken link.\n\nAFP Fact Check also called the Nigerian number listed as a contact but it appeared to have been disconnected.\n\nAFP Fact Check has published other debunks (here and here) linked to similar scams, which claim to offer gifts under the guise of official promotions in order to boost their followers on Facebook.", "lang": "en"}
