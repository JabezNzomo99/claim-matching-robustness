The JIT determined the missile system had been provided from Russia and identified the military unit it belonged to \u2013 the Russian armed forces\u2019 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade.\n\nThe next day, the governments of Australia and the Netherlands officially declared that they were holding Russia responsible for the incident, which claimed many Dutch and Australian nationals among the victims.\n\nShortly thereafter, the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta published a letter, from families of MH-17 victims, that cited some of the Kremlin\u2019s alternative explanations for the plane\u2019s downing, including:\n\u2022 \u201cMH17 was shot down by a Ukrainian jet.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cIt was blown up by a missile intended for the Russian President\u2019s plane.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cIt was already full of dead bodies and deliberately crashed.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cIt was shot down by a BUK missile but not one of Russia\u2019s.\u201d\n\nAric Toler of the investigative group Bellingcat has published an extensive list of the Kremlin\u2019s \u201cself-contradicting\u201d narratives on the matter.\n\nWhile Russian state media continue to spin alternative theories of what happened to MH17, parties to the Russian conflict in Ukraine have apparently let information on the matter slip.\n\nFor example, a social media account associated with Igor \u201cStrelkov\u201d Girkin, a Russian citizen and commander of \u201crebel\u201d forces in the Donbas, bragged about downing a Ukrainian military An-26 cargo plane in the vicinity of MH17\u2019s crash site. The post showed photos of a rising column of smoke and a warning to the Ukrainian military to \u201cstay out of our sky.\u201d\n\nOnce it became clear that it was MH17 and not an An-26 which had been shot down, the post disappeared, and the alternative theories began. However, Russian state media cited the post in initial stories about the downing of a Ukrainian An-26, and some of those pieces are still online today.\n\nBut what about Ukraine\u2019s culpability for not closing its airspace.\n\nThat issue is open to debate.\n\nIn October 2015, the Dutch Safety Board found that Ukraine should have closed its airspace, as two Ukrainian military planes had been hit while flying at altitudes used by airliners.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin defended the country\u2019s decision to leave its airspace open.\n\n\u201cNo one at this time ... was even aware of the presence of highly sophisticated anti-air missile capabilities,\u201d Reuters quoted Klimkin as saying. \u201cNo-one at the time had any kind of awareness of such a threat ... everyone was absolutely sure it was about purely conventional weapons.\u201d\n\nDespite the claim by Sputnik\u2019s source that Russia was committed to justice in the matter, in July 2015 Russia vetoed a United Nations Security Council draft resolution that would have set up an international tribunal to prosecute those responsible for shooting down MH17.\n\nRussia proposed its own draft resolution that demanded justice for those behind the downing of the airliner but opposed a criminal tribunal.\n\nAnd while there are valid arguments to be made that Ukraine should have closed its airspace, to hold Kyiv, and not the actual culprits, responsible for the plane\u2019s downing, is specious.\n\nPolygraph.info therefore finds Sputnik\u2019s claims to be false.", "lang": "en"}
