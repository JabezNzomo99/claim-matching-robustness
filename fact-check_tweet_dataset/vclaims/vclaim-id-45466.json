This is false; there is no ongoing recall of romaine lettuce in Canada, authorities and a Costco web page confirm. The websites pushing the information have been debunked by AFP several times for similar hoaxes.\n\n\u201cRomaine Lettuce Recalled Due To E. Coli Outbreak in Costco Canada,\u201d reads the headline of the article published on June 8, 2020.\n\nIt claims that following an investigation, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) advised residents of nine Canadian provinces not to consume romaine lettuce, while many large retailers such as Costco decided to pull the produce from their shelves.\n\nHowever, there is no ongoing recall or warning for romaine lettuce in Canada.\n\nThe Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), which works alongside PHAC, is in charge of warning the public of potential food safety issues, and makes all recall notices available on this website. On June 10, a search in CFIA\u2019s database showed no active warnings for romaine lettuce.\n\n\u201cCFIA did not issue a recall,\u201d Christine Carnaffan, a spokeswoman for the agency, told AFP by email.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve received a few enquiries from the public,\" she added. \"It\u2019s sad to hear of people throwing away food because of these fake recalls.\u201d\n\nCostco\u2019s web page dedicated to product recalls also does not feature recalls for romaine lettuce in the past 120 days.\n\nThe last similar warning dates back to November 2019, when lettuce from California was found to have been contaminated with E. coli, and was removed from shelves.\n\nAn identical version of the article was published on the same day on toronto-ontario.news, a web page that belongs to a network of Facebook pages and news websites that AFP Fact Check has debunked for several other fake food recall articles.\n\nAFP Fact Check previously reported that although the sites appear to be local Canadian news organizations, their Facebook pages are at least partly administered from Kosovo.\n\nThe domain \u201cblog-toronto.com\u201d -- the website on which the false article appears -- was created two weeks before the article\u2019s publication, a domain name search shows.\n\nThe fact that an identical article was published on \"toronto-ontario.news\" on the same day suggests that \u201cblog-toronto.com\u201d could be the latest addition to the network. However, the website\u2019s owner used a domain registrar, which conceals their true identity.\n\nConsumers in Canada can learn about the food safety investigation process on this webpage.", "lang": "en"}
