That\u2019s false.\n\n\n\nThere is no evidence of a video showing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her longtime aide Huma Abedin sexually assaulting and terrorizing a young girl \u2014 despite a fictional tale being widely spread across social media.\n\nAn April 16 story on thepedogate.com, which is dedicated to such conspiracy theories, said the New York City Police Department dubbed the video the \u201c\u2018Rosetta Stone\u2019 of information connecting senior politicians, such as Clinton, to an elite pedophile ring\u201d \u2014 echoing the debunked \u201cPizzagate\u201d theory from 2016 that alleged Clinton and her aides were running a child sex ring out of a Washington, D.C. pizza shop.\n\nBut the NYPD\u2019s Office of the Deputy Commissioner for Public Information confirmed in an email to FactCheck.org that the department is not investigating such a video. There are also no credible news \u201creports\u201d about the video, as was claimed in a similar story on yournewswire.com.\n\nYournewswire.com \u2014 a website known to traffic false news \u2014 claimed that the video of Clinton and Abedin had surfaced on the \u201cdark web,\u201d a collection of web properties that hide their IP addresses for anonymity and where some illegal activity is known to occur.\n\nThat story said the video was found on the laptop of former Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner, Abedin\u2019s estranged husband. He was convicted last year of \u201csexting\u201d with an underage girl.\n\nWhile some Facebook users rightly flagged the stories as false, the claims continued to amass a substantial audience in recent days \u2014 including more than 500,000 views on related YouTube videos that spread the rumor. None of these videos contains images of the alleged sex crime \u2014 just descriptions based on unnamed sources who purportedly viewed it.\n\nOne YouTube video, which received nearly 190,000 views, attributes the existence of the \u201c\u2018Horrific\u2019 Hillary Clinton snuff film\u201d only to \u201creliable sources who have viewed the material and confirmed the content is worse than any nightmare.\u201d\n\nA link to the yournewswire.com story posted on the popular Facebook group \u201cDonald Trump Commander in Chief 2020\u201d garnered more than 1,500 shares. Some people who commented on the story questioned its veracity, but many others called for Clinton to be investigated and jailed.\n\n\u201cI read enough today to make me sick to my stomach! Monsters around us! But, not for long!!!\u201d one woman wrote.\n\nThe implications of such theories were evident in December 2016, when an armed, 28-year-old man from North Carolina who believed the \u201cPizzagate\u201d accounts opened fire inside the Washington, D.C., pizza shop named in the bogus stories. No injuries were reported. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four years in prison.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201cArrest Made in an Assault with a Dangerous Weapon (Gun): 5000 Block of Connecticut Avenue, Northwest.\u201d Press release.
