The group got away with it because television stations in Pennsylvania kept running the ad even though the Sestak campaign provided evidence that it was false.\n\nBut what was this evil plan? It turns out to be the 2010 report by the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, better known as Bowles-Simpson because it was co-chaired by former White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles, a Democrat, and former senator Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.). President Obama established the commission, which sought to identify ways to trim nearly $4 trillion from projected deficits through 2020.\n\nThe bulk of the savings were not from proposals affecting Social Security and Medicare, the items highlighted in the ad, but from cuts in discretionary spending and higher taxes. Still, the report landed with a thud in Washington. The commission passed the report by a vote of 11 to 7, which meant it fell short of the 14-vote threshold for sending the package to Congress for a vote.\n\nSestak was not on the commission, and while in Congress he never cast a vote regarding its provisions. Emily\u2019s List bases its claims on vague references of \u201csupport\u201d for the plan that Sestak has made on a handful of occasions over of the years, mostly in the context of the general need to reduce the budget deficit.\n\nWhen the plan was released in December 2010, Sestak was already an outgoing member of Congress, having just narrowly lost a Senate race to Toomey. Emily\u2019s List cites an article that appeared in the Wilkes-Barre Citizens\u2019 Voice in 2011 in which the former congressman decried partisanship at the time over the debt limit. He said that Obama should have embraced Bowles-Simpson with the \u201cpower of the bully pulpit\u201d to achieve long-term budgetary reform before the debt crisis took place.\n\nIn a 2010 speech cited by Emily\u2019s List, given before the report was released, Sestak said that \u201cwe have to structurally address our entitlement programs.\u201d More recently, in 2016, Sestak referred to the plan as a \u201ctemplate upon which you can address both the needed raise in revenues and the proper reform of entitlements.\u201d\n\nNone of these statements are particularly noteworthy. In the 2012 presidential campaign, President Obama said he had used the plan as an outline for his own deficit-reduction efforts. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve done, made some adjustments to it, and we\u2019re putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan,\u201d he said in a debate with Mitt Romney.\n\nMoreover, when Obama tried to reach a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with Republicans on the deficit in 2011, he floated the idea of changing the cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security benefits \u2014 and then even included the concept in his 2014 budget proposal. When Emily\u2019s List accuses Sestak of wanting to cut Social Security benefits, it is actually referring to a proposal embraced by Obama.\n\nMore to the point, Sestak has never embraced or voted on particular elements of the Bowles-Simpson report. His support remained vague \u2014 and at times was critical. In an interview on MSNBC shortly after the report was released, he said the long-term health of Social Security could be handled easily but health care entitlements such as Medicare and Medicaid were a bigger challenge. \u201cThat was the disappointment in the deficit commission,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just said, here\u2019s a cap on Medicare and Medicaid health care. They didn\u2019t say how to go.\u201d\n\nThe Sestak campaign, in its letter to television stations, cited dozens of votes in Congress in which Sestak supported expanded Social Security benefits. The letter also cited Sestak\u2019s 2015 book, filled with policy proposals, in which he called for making the wealthy pay more into Social Security so benefits would not need to be cut or the retirement age raised. In other words, Sestak\u2019s actual plan was the exact opposite of what Emily\u2019s List suggests.\n\nThe ad\u2019s citation of PolitiFact is especially misleading. That 2014 fact check had nothing to do with Sestak but concerned a House member who had voted for a 2012 resolution that called for following the principles of Bowles-Simpson. (It failed 38 to 382.) Buried in the article, PolitiFact said it was true that Bowles-Simpson called for raising the retirement age. But it also noted that under Bowles-Simpson, it would not inch up from 67 to 68 until 2050. The ruling in this particular fact check was \u201chalf true.\u201d\n\nThis is indeed a serious issue, but few lawmakers will be willing to make hard choices if they fear they will be falsely attacked like this. Emily\u2019s List is doing a disservice to American democracy when it engages in such deceptive advertising.", "lang": "en"}
