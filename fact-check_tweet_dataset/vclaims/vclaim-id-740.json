The photographs received broad media coverage at the time they were initially released, well before the start of Trump Sr.\u2019s bid for the White House.\n\nOn 13 March 2012, the web site Gothamist published an article titled \u201cPhotos: Donald Trump\u2019s Sons Awesome At Killing Elephants And Other Wildlife.\u201d It said:\n\nAnimal rights activists are revolted by a series of trophy photos that have emerged showing Eric and Donald Trump Jr. posing with a dead elephant, kudu, civet cat and waterbuck while on a big game safari in Zimbabwe last year. In one photo, Donald Jr. proudly holds a dead elephant tail in one hand and a knife in the other. In another, the brothers are seen standing beside a 12\u20198\u2033 crocodile hanging from a noose off a tree. Activists obtained the photos and created [a] video montage of the Trumps\u2019 big hunt[.]\n\nBritish tabloid the Daily Mail concurrently ran the photos in a piece titled \u201c\u2018I have no shame\u2026 I HUNT & EAT game\u2019: Donald Trump\u2019s sons pictured posing with their \u2018trophy\u2019 carcasses on big African hunt.\u201d It cited the web site Hunting Legends as a source for the photographs.\n\nIn March 2012, Donald Trump Jr. sent several tweets that addressed the controversy:\n\nThe Daily Mail quoted since-deleted tweets published by Trump Jr. in March 2012:\n\n\u2018Not a PR move I didn\u2019t give the pics but I have no shame about them either. I HUNT & EAT game\u2019. \u2018I AM A HUNTER I don\u2019t hide from that,\u2019 he said to another critic on Twitter.\n\nDonald Trump Jr.\u2019s hunting interests made headlines again in December 2019 when a ProPublica report raised questions about a permit he received to shoot argali in Mongolia.
