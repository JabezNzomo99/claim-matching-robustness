Jeffrey Harrigian, commander of the U.S. Air Forces in Europe, during which he outlined tactics the U.S. Air Force is developing in response to the threat of long-range Russian missile launchers positioned in Kaliningrad.\n\nKaliningrad\u2019s strategic geographic location in the heart of Europe \u2013 between Poland and Lithuania on the Baltic Sea \u2013 makes this Russian exclave potentially the most dangerous territory from which Moscow could launch a military offense against the rest of Europe.\n\nAs of 2014, Russia had deployed its most advanced strategic weapons and some 225,000 personnel in seven military bases in Kaliningrad. Since then, those numbers are thought to have increased.\n\nIndeed, Russia reportedly has been building up its military presence in Kaliningrad.\n\nThe exclave \u201cpractically bristles with S-300 and S-400 air-defense missiles, Oniks anti-ship missiles and Iskander surface-to-surface missiles,\u201d The National Interest wrote on September 19.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force\u2019s command in Europe has been developing defense plans in response to this increasing threat, Gen. Harrigian said in his September 17 comment. If Russian aggression emanating from the strategically located Kaliningrad exclave required a U.S. response, he said, \u201cit would be a multi-domain, very timely and effective capability that we would bring to ensure we have the access we need in that environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, it is not necessary to comment on all the stupid statements made by American generals,\u201d Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said. \u201cBut, when something like this happens, I was to say to our colleagues that they would be better off looking after their chief business and looking at what is going on with their own missile defense.\u201d He added that the attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure happened \u201cdespite the presence of the U.S. Patriot missile defense system\u201d at the site.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: \u201cOf course, security in its various aspects in all regions of the Russian Federation, including Kaliningrad, is provided at the proper level.\u201d\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said \u201cintelligent people \u2026 will never make such statements.\"\n\nAnd, despite what Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said in its statement, the commander of the U.S. Air Forces in Europe did not refer to any \u201cplans\u201d to conquer Kaliningrad. That claim is false.", "lang": "en"}
