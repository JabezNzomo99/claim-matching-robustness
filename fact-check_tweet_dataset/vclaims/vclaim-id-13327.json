That was agreed by parliament and became law in March 2017.\n\nStage two is working out the arrangements for withdrawing from the EU. This has been recently agreed between negotiators for the UK government and the EU in the form of the draft withdrawal agreement. But before it means anything, it has to be agreed by the UK parliament and other EU institutions.\n\u2022 How much the UK will pay the EU to settle its obligations (also known as the \u201cdivorce bill\u201d).\n\u2022 The \u201ctransition\u201d period which will go on until the end of 2020. During that time we remain in the single market and the customs union and continue to trade freely with the EU. But we do leave EU institutions, for example, we\u2019ll have no UK members in the European parliament.\n\u2022 The rights of UK and EU citizens post-Brexit (for example UK citizens who have been living in an EU country for five years by the end of the transition period will have the right to live there permanently\u2014and vice-versa for EU citizens living in the UK).\n\u2022 A \u201cbackstop\u201d arrangement to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. We\u2019ve written more about what this might look like here.\n\nThat brings us to stage three which is where we negotiate our future trade relationship with the EU. This is set to happen during the transition period.\n\nIn an article for Conservative Home, former Brexit secretary David Davis argued against the negotiated withdrawal agreement. He also said that if the UK needs \u201cto leave the EU with no deal and negotiate a free trade agreement during the transition period, so be it\u201d.\n\nAs other commentators have pointed out, this wouldn\u2019t be possible. The transition period only happens if the withdrawal agreement gets signed off.\n\nA \u201cno deal\u201d scenario\u2014where the withdrawal agreement doesn\u2019t get signed off\u2014would mean there isn\u2019t a transition period within which to negotiate our future trade relationship with the EU.\n\nWe could still try and negotiate a post-Brexit free trade agreement with the EU in a no deal scenario, it\u2019s just that without the withdrawal agreement, and the transition period, the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU will be very different immediately after March 2019.\n\nThe Institute for Government have explained what no deal might look like here.\n\nThe withdrawal agreement isn\u2019t meant to address the issue of a future customs union\n\nIn a video criticising the agreement, the Labour party said the withdrawal agreement doesn\u2019t guarantee the UK would stay in a customs union.\n\nThis is technically correct, but that\u2019s because the withdrawal agreement is not designed to address our future trade relationship with the EU (which could involve a customs union).\n\nThe withdrawal agreement does make arrangements for a \u201cbackstop \u201d trade arrangement, if a more preferable solution can\u2019t be agreed as part of the future trade talks.\n\nThat backstop arrangement would be a \u201csingle customs territory\u201d for trade between the UK and the EU. There are many parts to this but essentially there will be no tariffs between the UK and the EU and some (though not all) trade restrictions will be removed\u2014that\u2019s been described as being similar to a customs union.\n\nThe withdrawal agreement says the EU and UK have a common objective of a close future relationship which will \u201cbuild on the single customs territory\u201d outlined in the backstop.", "lang": "en"}
