She was named in those websites as Vicky Xipolitakis, a model who wanted to meet Pope Francis in Paraguay during his 2015 visit but was escorted away for not wearing a bra beneath her sheer white t-shirt.\n\nThe real, unedited photos show only Xipolitakis. Pope Francis did not kiss her. In fact, reports said that because she was escorted out, she never met the Pontiff in person.\n\nPhotos of a kissing Pope Francis, meanwhile, are not difficult to obtain, given that he kisses a lot of babies and relics.\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
