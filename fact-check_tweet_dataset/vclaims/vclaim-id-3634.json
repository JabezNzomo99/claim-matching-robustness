Another proclaims: \u201cCourt Orders Obama To Pay $400 Million In Restitution.\u201d\n\nBut those stories are false.\n\nThe posts, flagged by Facebook users as potentially fake, evidently did fool some into believing Obama was ordered to pay the large sum for alleged misdeeds: Numerous public posts and comments praised the fictitious court decision.\n\n\u201cWow, this is awesome!!!!!!! President Trump should use the money to build the wall that Obama did not want,\u201d one Facebook user opined.\n\nThe claims were published by sites such as reaganwasright.com \u2014 which labels its work as satire and says \u201ceverything on this website is fiction\u201d \u2014 and specialnewsusa.com, which offers no such disclaimer. A Facebook page associated with the latter website has nearly 60,000 followers.\n\nBoth stories cite federal courts that don\u2019t exist, including the \u201cWest Texas Federal Probate Court\u201d and the \u201cWest Texas Federal Appeals Court, operating out of the 33rd District.\u201d\n\nThe federal courts in Texas include the Northern, Southern, Western and Eastern districts. Appeals from those courts go to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers districts in Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana.\n\nAnd the judges aren\u2019t real, either. The reaganwasright.com post mentions \u201cJudge Sanford Batt\u201d and the specialnewsusa.com story names judges \u201cGary Jones,\u201d \u201cAmanda Perry,\u201d and \u201cKris Weinshenker.\u201d\n\nThere are no federal judges by those names, according to the Federal Judicial Center\u2019s online directory of federal judges.\n\nThe $400 million references a payment made to Iran in 2016 during the Obama administration.\n\nThe court \u201chas ordered that Barack Obama repay $400 Million to the American people for funds he says were \u2018lost\u2019 during an illegal transaction with Iranian hard-liners,\u201d reads the specialnewsusa.com story.\n\nWhile that cash payment was criticized by some, the Obama White House never claimed the money was \u201clost.\u201d\n\nThe $400 million was part of a $1.7 billion payment that resolved a dispute with Iran dating back to 1979 over military equipment for which Iran paid the U.S. but never received.\n\nCritics questioned the timing of the cash payment \u2014 made on the same day Iran released several American prisoners. The Obama administration maintained the payment was used as \u201cleverage,\u201d but denied that it amounted to ransom.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201cBrief History.\u201d U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
