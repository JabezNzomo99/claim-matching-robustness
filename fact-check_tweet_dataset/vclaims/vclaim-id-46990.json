This is false; Black Lives Matter says it did not issue any such directives, and the supposed rules first appeared in posts that made no mention of the organization.\n\nBlack Lives Matter (BLM) has gained increasingly broad support since the death of Floyd in Minneapolis police custody on May 25, 2020, which sparked weeks of mostly peaceful rallies across the United States and worldwide. But the group has also been the target of misinformation, including social media posts that seek to undermine its aims and values.\n\n\u201cBLM pasted these \u2018rules\u2019 for \u2018white folks\u2019 attending protests on social media,\u201d says the June 8, 2020 article on uniteamericafirst.com, which was founded by a man named Will Johnson.\n\nHe says he was \u201cblessed\u201d to have been invited by President Donald Trump to the White House, and has posted that \u201cyou can\u2019t be a Christian and believe in BLM.\u201d\n\nThe article includes an image of the alleged rules, which appears to be a screenshot of this tweet from an account that promotes pro-Trump views and has disparaged BLM.\n\nAmong the instructions: \u201cIf a black person tells you to do something, you do it immediately without question.\u201d\n\nAnother tells whites to \u201cstay in the back\u201d until they hear a call such as, \u201cwhite people to the front.\u201d\n\nThe \u201crules,\u201d which have been called \u201cracist,\u201d also tell whites: \u201cYour job is to follow and add your voice when it is called for.\u201d\n\nBut Black Lives Matter did not issue the purported guidance.\n\n\"BLM Global Network did not release any 'rules for white protesters' language, nor was it posted or shared on any of our social accounts,\u201d Kailee Scales, managing director of the Black Lives Matter Global Network covering the US, Canada and UK, told AFP by email.\n\nLike the marches themselves, the misinformation about how to protest has spread across the globe.\n\nSome social media posts, including this one from an Australian anti-immigration party politician, linked the rules to \u201cBlack Lives Matter Melbourne\u201d in Australia. A British-based conspiracy theorist, Paul Joseph Watson, also claimed the rules originated there.\n\nHowever, a protest on June 6, 2020 in Melbourne in support of Black Lives Matter was organized by Warriors of the Aboriginal Resistance, whose Facebook page made no mention of any such rules ahead of that rally.\n\nSome US Facebook users apparently sympathetic to Black Lives Matter shared the \u201crules,\u201d including here in a North Carolina group, and here ahead of a June 12 \u201cYouth for BLM March and Speak Out\u201d in Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nBut Scales, of Black Lives Matter, strongly encouraged \u201canyone interested in or a part of our movement to seek messaging from trusted and official sources -- such as our BLM Global Network social feeds, our emails, and our official Black Lives Matter website rather than unknown or untrusted sources claiming BLM Global Network\u2019s name.\u201d\n\nShe earlier told AFP that \u201cthe disinformation about us starts at the fringe but is amplified by right-wing propaganda networks and brought into the mainstream by sharing on social platforms.\u201d\n\nAt the start of June, other US posts, as well as some in Canada, listed the same \u201crules\u201d but with no mention of Black Lives Matter, and no indication of where they originated.\n\n\u201cTomorrow there will be a PEACEFUL protest held in Vancouver. If you are planning on attending please take a look over the below!\u201d one of them said.\n\nA search on social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle found the earliest mention of the rules on June 2 in a Facebook post by an Arkansas resident who has posted in support of the movement.\n\nAs with many others posting the supposed guidelines, they had been copied and pasted, making their origin more difficult to determine.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked more than 30 examples of false or misleading information about Floyd and the protests that followed his death.", "lang": "en"}
