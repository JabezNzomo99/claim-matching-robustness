Once those two things were cleared, the money flowed. There was never any connection between the flow of money and the server.\u201d\n\nMulvaney told Wallace to look at the \u201cfacts\u201d and \u201cwhat actually happened in the real world.\u201d\n\nBut some of those facts contradict Mulvaney\u2019s argument \u2013 including text messages and testimony from other government officials and a May letter from the Defense Department approving the release of funds to Ukraine and certifying that Ukraine has taken \u201csubstantial actions to make defense institutional reforms for the purposes of decreasing corruption, increasing accountability, and sustaining improvements of combat capability enabled by U.S. assistance.\u201d\n\nThe House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry is focused on President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withhold nearly $391 million in appropriated security aid to Ukraine and whether he did so as part of a pressure campaign to get Ukrainian President Zelensky to investigate Democrats and former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential 2020 political rival.\n\nIn a July 25 phone call \u2014 one of the key events described in an Aug. 12 whistleblower complaint \u2014 Trump told Zelensky the U.S. \u201chas been very very good to Ukraine\u201d and asked for \u201ca favor,\u201d that Zelensky look into CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm hired by the Democratic National Committee after its computer network was hacked. That\u2019s an apparent reference to a debunked conspiracy theory. Trump also asked Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,\u201d a White House memo, which notes it isn\u2019t a verbatim transcript, says Trump told Zelensky.\n\nBiden, as vice president, pressured the previous Ukrainian president to fire the country\u2019s prosecutor general, who was widely viewed as ineffective at prosecuting corruption, or risk losing $1 billion in loan guarantees from the U.S. At the time, Hunter Biden was on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company. As we\u2019ve written, there is no evidence that Joe Biden \u201cstopped the prosecution\u201d to help his son. Joe Biden was carrying out Obama administration policy, which was consistent with the international community and anti-corruption advocates in Ukraine.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said that his request that Zelensky launch investigations into Biden and the DNC server wasn\u2019t linked to the withholding of security aid. \u201cThere was no quid pro quo,\u201d Trump has said.\n\nBut in his Oct. 17 press briefing, Mulvaney acknowledged there was a link between the aid and an investigation into the server, and that such quid pro quos were common in foreign policy.\n\nWallace played that clip, too, during the \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d interview. Hours after the press briefing, Mulvaney tried to walk back his remarks, much as he did in the interview, saying in a statement that the \u201conly reasons\u201d for the freeze on the money were concerns over corruption and support from other countries.\n\nMulvaney told Wallace he could \u201cprove\u201d that the administration withheld security aid due to concerns about corruption in Ukraine, because the aid was released \u201conce we were able to satisfy ourselves that corruption was actually \u2014 they were doing better with it.\u201d\n\nBut the Defense Department had certified in May in a letter that Ukraine was taking steps to reduce corruption regarding defense institutions, and, according to Politico, it completed a second White House-ordered review of the aid package by late August. The aid was released on Sept. 11 \u2014 two days after House committee chairs announced they would investigate whether Trump tried to pressure Ukraine into conducting \u201cpolitically-motivated investigations under the guise of anti-corruption activity.\u201d\n\nUndersecretary of Defense for Policy John Rood wrote in the May letter to congressional committees that he, \u201con behalf of the Secretary of Defense, and in coordination with the Secretary of State\u201d had \u201ccertified\u201d that Ukraine \u201chas taken substantial actions to make defense institutional reforms for the purposes of decreasing corruption, increasing accountability, and sustaining improvements of combat capability enabled by U.S. assistance.\u201d Rood\u2019s letter said \u201cnow that this defense institutional reform has occurred,\u201d the Defense Department could move forward in providing the congressionally appropriated aid to Ukraine. \u201cImplementation of this further support will begin no sooner than 15 days following this notification,\u201d the letter said.\n\n\u201cSubstantial progress has been made on defense reform since 2014, but there remain areas that require significant attention,\u201d Rood wrote. Those areas included \u201cincreased transparency in acquisition and budgeting\u201d and \u201cimplementation of a modern human resources management system,\u201d but there was no mention of corruption.\n\nThis was the second notice sent to Congress regarding $250 million Congress had appropriated for fiscal 2019. (Trump also froze $141.5 million in aid from the State Department.) An aide to Sen. Dick Durbin, the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee on defense appropriations, told us the Defense Department sent the first notice in February.\n\nThe certification that Ukraine had made \u201cdefense institutional reforms\u201d to decrease corruption and other purposes is required by law, under the National Defense Authorization Act (see the fiscal 2017 law section 1237 and amendments by the 2019 law section 1246). The NDAA requires the secretaries of defense and state to issue this certification before half of the appropriated security assistance aid for that year can be released.\n\nOn June 18, the Defense Department announced it would send the $250 million in security assistance to Ukraine.\n\nHowever, Trump then ordered a freeze on the aid and another review. The hold on the funding was first reported by Politico on Aug. 28. That story said \u201cTrump asked his national security team to review the funding program, known as the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, in order to ensure the money is being used in the best interest of the United States,\u201d according to \u201ca senior administration official.\u201d\n\nBut the story also said that the review had been completed. A senior Defense Department official told the media outlet that \u201cthe department has reviewed the foreign assistance package and supports it.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the Defense Department certification, text messages exchanged by U.S. officials and congressional testimony undercut Mulvaney\u2019s claim that the freeze on funding was tied to anti-corruption efforts.\n\nHouse Democrats released several text messages provided by Kurt Volker, the U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, during his Oct. 3 testimony before the intelligence, oversight and reform, and foreign affairs committees. The messages indicated U.S. officials believed Ukraine\u2019s willingness to investigate Democrats and the 2016 election was tied to either the aid or an official White House visit for Zelensky.\n\nOn Aug. 10, Volker and Andrey Yermak, a Zelensky aide, exchanged text messages about a \u201cstatement\u201d Volker said Zelensky should use \u201cto get date\u201d for a White House visit. Yermak responded that once the date is set, Ukraine would \u201ccall for a press briefing, announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of US-UKRAINE relationship, including among other things Burisma and election meddling in investigations.\u201d\n\nOther texts showed William Taylor, the charge d\u2019affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, believed the aid to Ukraine and the White House meeting were being tied to those investigations.\n\nIn a Sept. 9 text, Taylor wrote: \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, responded several hours later: \u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign.\u201d\n\nBut Sondland also told House committees, according to his Oct. 17 prepared opening statement, that the U.S. delegation to Zelensky\u2019s inauguration on May 20, which included Sondland, \u201cdeveloped positive views of the new Ukraine President and his desire \u2026 to address Ukraines well-known and longstanding corruption issues.\u201d\n\nSondland said, \u201cIn my opinion, security aid to Ukraine was in our vital national interest and should not have been delayed for any reason.\u201d\n\nTaylor testified on Oct. 22 that after he assumed his post at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine on June 17, he saw \u201cencouraging\u201d signs that Zelensky was serious about fighting corruption. Zelensky \u201chad appointed reformist ministers and supported long-stalled anti-corruption legislation. He took quick executive action, including opening Ukraine\u2019s High Anti-Corruption Court, which was established under the previous presidential administration but never allowed to operate,\u201d Taylor said, according to his prepared opening statement. \u201cThere was much excitement in Kyiv that this time things could be different \u2014 a new Ukraine might finally be breaking from its corrupt, post-Soviet past.\u201d\n\nTaylor, who had been the ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009, said he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d in late August that he couldn\u2019t explain to the Ukrainians why the security aid was being withheld, but he came to understand it was tied to Zelensky agreeing to undertake certain investigations that Trump wanted.\n\nTaylor said that on Sept. 1 Sondland told him \u201ceverything \u2026 including security assistance\u201d depended on an announcement by Zelensky on investigations. \u201c[Sondland] said that President Trump wanted President Zelenskyy \u2018in a public box\u2019 by making a public statement about ordering such investigations.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 8, Taylor again spoke with Sondland. \u201cHe said he had talked to President Trump as I had suggested a week earlier, but that President Trump was adamant that President Zelenskyy, himself, had to \u2018clear things up and do it in public,'\u201d Taylor testified. \u201cPresident Trump said it was not a \u2018quid pro quo.\u2019 Ambassador Sondland said that he had talked to President Zelenskyy and [Zelensky aide] Mr. Yermak and told them that, although this was not a quid pro quo, if President Zelenskyy did not \u2018clear things up\u2019 in public, we would be at a \u2018stalemate.\u2019 I understood a \u2018stalemate\u2019 to mean that Ukraine would not receive the much-needed military assistance. Ambassador Sondland said that this conversation concluded with President Zelenskyy agreeing to make a public statement in an interview with CNN.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 11, on the eve of a potentially bipartisan vote by the Senate Committee on Appropriations to force the administration to release funding to Ukraine, the White House released the money.\n\nZelensky didn\u2019t do the interview on CNN, which Taylor had discouraged.\n\nMulvaney said the other reason for withholding the aid was concern \u201cabout whether or not other nations, specifically European nations, were helping with foreign aid to the Ukraine as well.\u201d He said the Office of Management and Budget determined that European countries \u201cdo give a considerable sum of money and nonlethal aid\u201d to Ukraine. But it\u2019s worth noting the OMB could determine this quickly, through publicly available information, such as figures from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Commission.\n\nThe OECD\u2019s website shows EU institutions head the list of the top 10 donors of official development assistance to Ukraine, with $425.2 million contributed on average for 2016-2017. The U.S. was second with $204.4 million in assistance, closely followed by Germany.\n\nA database maintained by the European Commission, which gets its figures from what\u2019s reported to OECD and the International Aid Transparency Initiative, shows Germany\u2019s aid to Ukraine from 2014 to 2017 totaled 786.5 million euros (about $860 million).\n\nAs we\u2019ve written, according to an analysis by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, European countries have contributed about two-thirds of all the aid to Ukraine \u2014 including military, humanitarian, economic and other aid \u2014 since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea.\n\nWe asked the White House press office for more information on the OMB\u2019s review and why the May certification from the Defense Department wasn\u2019t sufficient to show Ukrainian progress on corruption, but we haven\u2019t received a response.\n\nFor more on key events in the impeachment probe and the related whistleblower complaint, see our updated timeline.", "lang": "en"}
