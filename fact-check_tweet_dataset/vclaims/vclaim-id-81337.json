What is less well-known is that we also teamed up on the first-ever Senate hearing on climate change for the Commerce Committee back in 1988.\u201d (He also said something in yet another Council on Foreign Relations speech in 2009.)\n\nDetermining the first hearing on climate change is somewhat open to interpretation. In theory, one could go back to the 1960s. Or one could focus on hearings in the House and Senate in the 1970s, which led to the creation of the National Climate Program Act of 1978 to study the impact of climate change. Kerry did not join the Senate until 1985, and some argue that those earlier hearings did not specifically focus on a possible global warming trend and the role of humans in climate change.\n\nYet, in 1982, while in the House of Representatives, then-Rep. Al Gore (D-Tenn.) organized a hearing that for the first time featured the testimony of James E. Hansen, then head of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Hansen in 2007 recalled that testimony, saying he told Congress that data indicated that the earth had warmed 0.7 degrees Fahrenheit over the previous century. Even earlier, in 1981, Gore (with Rep. James H. Scheuer of New York) arranged a hearing that featured the testimony of scientist Roger Revelle on global warming\u2013which some experts peg as the first congressional hearing on climate change.\n\nThen came Hansen\u2019s testimony on June 23, 1988, before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. That hearing was presided over and organized by then-Sen. Timothy Wirth (D-Colo.), who later told an interviewer that, for a bit of stage effect, he chose a particularly hot day in the summer\u2014it turned out to be a record high\u2013and left the windows of the hearing room open the night before. Thus witnesses were sweltering and wiping their brows as they testified about global warming. (Note: We later determined that Wirth\u2019s anecdote was false.)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there was any single congressional hearing in the 1970s or early 1980s that had any strong impact. There were, as you say, a number of hearings, but none stands out as special,\u201d said Spencer R. Weart, former director of the Center for History of Physics of the American Institute of Physics. \u201cIt is widely agreed, on the other hand, that the committee hearing of June 23, 1988, and in particular Jim Hansen\u2019s testimony there and his talk with reporters afterward, was a milestone. In connection with serious climate problems in the United States that summer, it made a huge media splash and did a lot to elevate global warming into public awareness.\u201d\n\nSo what is Kerry talking about? Alec Gerlach, a Kerry spokesman, pointed to another hearing, held in February of 1989 by the Commerce Committee. The chairman of the committee was Ernest F. \u201cFritz\u201d Hollings (D-S.C.) and Gore at the time was chairman of the subcommittee on Science, Technology and Space. The purpose of the hearing was to highlight a bill introduced by Hollings that would require government research into the impact of climate change.\n\n\u201cSecretary Kerry rightly referred to the work he contributed to in the Senate along with Senators Gore and Wirth beginning in 1988 and 1989 on the issue of climate change, a cause he\u2019s been committed to for his entire career. As the Secretary made clear, these hearings were a turning point: the first to point to new research that made clear the human impact on increasing greenhouse gasses was connected to climate change and a warming planet. No prior congressional discussions had made that critical connection. Without that link to a human impact, the case for this generation to act to curb emissions is dampened, but as Secretary Kerry made clear in his remarks, since those hearings: \u2018the science has been screaming at us, warning us, trying to compel us to act.\u2019\u201d\n\nTo be fair to Kerry, he has been involved in the debate about climate change for many years, as a member of the Senate. He can certainly claim to have been passionate about the issue for a long time. While he may have been a junior member of the Senate in the late 1980s, his role on the issue certainly grew as he gained seniority.\n\nGore might have bragging rights about organizing one of the first hearings, but not Kerry. Kerry was not even a participant in the most important hearing of that time; he simply spoke at a hearing that took place the following year. And yet, like Brian Williams claiming to have come under fire in Iraq, Kerry has repeatedly placed himself at the center of the action\u2014and the narrative.", "lang": "en"}
