This refers roughly to the period 2011-2016.\n\nHowever, the report itself only looks directly at figures for England and Wales. It estimates the Wales Route makes up about 11% of the route length in England and Wales, and says it gets 1.63% of the spending on \u201cenhancements\u201d. Although out of the whole UK, it\u2019s plausibly closer to 1%.\n\nEnhancements refer to things like improving network capability, reliability and capacity, rather than total investment or spending on the Wales Route. Other types of spending outside of enhancements include restoring ageing infrastructure, for which Wales took a bigger share of 6.32%, and day-to-day spending on maintenance and operations (which wouldn\u2019t strictly be counted as \u201cinvestment\u201d).\n\nWales\u2019 share of total spending is larger than 1%. Using Office of Road and Rail data for 2011-2016, the report says: \u201cSince its inception in 2011 until 2015-16, as a proportion of UK Government investment the Wales Route has received, in cash terms, \u00a31.99bn (~4.37%) out of an England/Wales total of \u00a344bn.\u201d\n\nWales makes up about 5.3% of the England and Wales population, according to the latest estimates.", "lang": "en"}
