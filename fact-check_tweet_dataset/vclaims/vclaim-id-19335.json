He has written and given quotes on firecrackers and pollution, but none in the way seen in the message.\n\nAdditionally, instances of the same message have been found online, dated back to October 2017, which makes this an old forwarded message making a comeback ahead of the upcoming festive season this year.\n\nBOOM used multiple extracts from the message in conjunction with time filters available on Google, and found that this message surfaced online as early as October 9, 2017, on a chat site called Chalanachithram. It appeared as a thread on social media website Reddit four days later.", "lang": "en"}
