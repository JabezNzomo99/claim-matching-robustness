First, it\u2019s factually incorrect. Second, while Allen is a conservative, he did not say this. A query to the Trump Organization, where Trump is executive vice president, for comment did not receive a response.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s deal with Allen. There was a Tim Allen \u2014 unrelated to the actor \u2014 who on Aug. 25 posted a lengthy diatribe on Facebook that included this line. This Tim Allen describes himself as a jewelry technician who lives in Franklin, Va. But that did not stop thousands of people from distributing his post as coming from the actor.\n\nThis claim also appears to have had its start on Facebook, being circulated in March, with almost the same wording as Nugent\u2019s post.\n\nIn 2013, we had looked into the question of the cost of the website. It was a difficult number to pin down, but the most recent government estimate was provided in 2014 in a questions-for-the-record document during the confirmation hearings for Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell. \u201cIt is my understanding that as of February 28, 2014, CMS has obligated a total of approximately $834 million on Marketplace-related IT contracts and interagency agreements,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Bloomberg News in 2014 said the cost actually exceeded $2 billion because the government estimate was limited to spending on computer systems whereas Bloomberg included all contracts that could be associated with the website project.\n\nBut even if one accepts $2 billion, that still is dwarfed by the spending on Trump\u2019s border barrier. (As we have often noted, it\u2019s bollard fencing, not a wall.) Even during the 2016 campaign, when Trump lowballed the cost of the barrier as under $8 billion \u2014 and claimed Mexico would pay for it \u2014 the website would have cost much less.\n\nSo far, Congress has appropriated $1.6 billion for the barrier, while Trump has tapped an additional $6.1 billion from previously approved military construction projects under a rarely used emergency authority. Trump has sought an additional $8.6 billion in funds in the next fiscal year, though lawmakers are balking at the request. If completed, the actual cost of the barrier is unknown, though estimates of more than $20 billion \u2014 or higher \u2014 have circulated.\n\nThe numbers are so much higher for the border barrier than the website that one wonders where this easily debunked claim emerged. Our colleagues at PolitiFact have speculated that it started with a 2017 Breitbart article that claimed that a single year of Obamacare, including subsidy payments and the like, would dwarf the cost of the wall. But even that article noted that the cost of the website was $2 billion, citing the Bloomberg estimate.\n\nThis is a game of telephone that has spun out of control. A debunked claim from earlier this year somehow emerged on Nugent\u2019s Facebook page and was copied by a Virginia man with the same name as an actor. The inaccurate claim was then falsely attributed to Tim Allen \u2014 and was distributed around the world by the president\u2019s son.", "lang": "en"}
