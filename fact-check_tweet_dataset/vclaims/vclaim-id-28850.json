After that only households with members aged 75 and over, who also receive pension credit, will be eligible for a free licence. The BBC estimates this would be around 1.5 million households. Roughly 4.5 million households received a free over-75s TV licence in 2017/18. A standard TV licence costs \u00a3154.50 a year for a colour TV.\n\nFollowing the announcement there was a lot of discussion about the cost of TV licences and access to television more generally. This included the claim that it costs \u00a38 per day to watch TV in hospital, but in prison it is free.\n\nAs part of a privileges scheme rewarding prisoners for good behaviour they can access TV in their cells. This privilege can also be removed as a punishment. A prisoner must pay the weekly rental cost of \u00a31 per week for a television. If prisoners share a cell then the cost will be split between all prisoners in the cell.\n\nChoice is limited to nine channels\u2014BBC1, BBC2, ITV1, Channel 4, Channel 5, ITV3, VIVA, Film 4 and ITV4 (or E4 in female prisons). Prison governors are allowed to change the selection of channels if they wish, but they must not exceed nine and subscription services are banned.\n\nIn hospitals the situation can vary from one organisation to the next. The Department for Health and Social Care told us it doesn\u2019t produce any formal guidance on this and that decisions on bedside TV and entertainment packages were made by individual NHS trusts. It added that free TVs are available in day rooms and communal areas in hospitals.\n\nSome hospitals use TV systems provided by companies like HTS or Hospedia. On its website, Hospedia says that some of the TV services it provides are free: children\u2019s programmes in children\u2019s wards during the day for example, or channels one to five in the mornings in adult wards. Other packages incur a fee, for example a wider range of channels, including sports and films.\n\nFor example, as of April 2018 at County Durham and Darlington NHS trust, TV was free on channels one to five in the mornings, according to a response submitted by the trust to a freedom of information request. Charges range from \u00a37.90 per day for the \u201c1 Day TV Bundle\u201d through to \u00a324.90 per day for the \u201c3 Day TV & Movies Bundle\u201d.\n\nOther hospitals provide TV free of charge to their patients in all or some wards. Others don\u2019t provide individual TV services to patients and only provide TV in communal areas, free of charge.", "lang": "en"}
