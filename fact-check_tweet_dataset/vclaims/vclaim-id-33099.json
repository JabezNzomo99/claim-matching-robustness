But health experts have refuted many of the claims, including one that sunlight can kill the virus, saying they are false or misleading; Sri Lankan health authorities have urged the public to refrain from sharing misleading information in order to curb the coronavirus \u201cinfo-demic.\u201d\n\nThe post was published here on Facebook on February 25, 2020. It has been shared more than 24,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe title of the Sinhala-language post translates to English as: \u201c ******Very important, read everyone**** How to prevent Corona\".\n\nThe post was published just hours after Italy reported a spike in confirmed coronavirus cases. The information shared in the misleading post was addressed to Sri Lankans in Italy, supposedly to inform them how to protect themselves from the COVID-19 virus.\n\nA similar claim was also shared on Facebook here, here, here, here and here.\n\nBut many of the practices detailed in the post are misleading and inaccurate.\n\nWhile detailing coronavirus symptoms, the post states: \u201cIf you are having a runny nose and feel congested when you are suffering from a cold, it cannot be coronavirus pneumonia, as the coronavirus pneumonia causes a dry cough, it does not cause a runny nose.\u201d\n\nThe claim is misleading; the World Health Organization (WHO) states clearly that while fever, tiredness and a dry cough are the most common coronavirus symptoms, patients may also experience nasal congestion and a runny nose.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the WHO's advice about COVID-19 symptoms on its official website:\n\nThe misleading post also claims that \u201cdrinking warm water\u201d and going \u201cunder the sunlight\u201d are effective preventive practices because \u201ccoronavirus is not heat resistant and can be killed in high temperatures.\u201d The post adds that people should keep their clothes in an area \u201cwith plenty of sunlight exposure in order to kill the virus.\u201d\n\nBut there is so far no conclusive evidence to suggest that sunlight kills the virus or that the virus would be less infectious in rising temperatures.\n\nThis article published on February 19, 2020 by Caixin, a Chinese financial and business news media group, cites several top Chinese health experts who note that while higher temperatures would decrease the survival time of the coronavirus, they do not affect its ability to infect.\n\nUS-based television channel National Geographic stated in an article published on February 25, 2020 that although milder viruses subside in warmer months due to what scientists call \u201cseasonality,\u201d it remains \u201chighly uncertain\u201d whether or not the coronavirus will behave similarly.\n\nThe misleading Facebook post also claims that the coronavirus is comparatively larger in size and therefore \u201cit cannot enter through a normal mask and will be filtered\u2026\u201d\n\nYet both international health experts note that masks provide only limited protection from the coronavirus and should only be worn by those already experiencing coronavirus symptoms or by health workers.\n\n\u201cPeople with no respiratory symptoms, such as cough, do not need to wear a medical mask,\u201d the WHO states here. \u201cWHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks.\u201d\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also states that it \u201cdoes not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.\u201d\n\nThe Facebook post also makes misleading claims about the durations that the coronavirus can survive on different surfaces.\n\n\u201cThe virus can survive a minimum or 12 hours on a metal surface\u2026.The virus can stay active on tissue between 6-12 hours...The virus can live on your hands only for about 5-10 minutes,\u201d the post reads.\n\nThe WHO, however, notes that \u201cit is not certain\u201d how long the virus can survive on inanimate surfaces and states that the life span could range from a few hours to several days depending on varying conditions such as surface type, temperature and humidity.\n\nThe post also advises readers to clean their throat three times per day with betadine, a topical antiseptic, to \u201cprevent or minimize risk of the virus entering the lung through the throat.\u201d\n\nYet Dr. Ashan Pathirana, Sri Lanka\u2019s Health Promotion Bureau Registrar, refuted the claim about cleansing one\u2019s throat.\n\n\u201cThe virus transmits via contact with respiratory droplets. So the key steps to remember are to avoid touching your face if you happen to be at a public space, use an alcohol based sanitizer and wash your hands thoroughly using soap, before you touch your face or consume food etc.,\u201d Pathirana told AFP by phone on February 27, 2020.\n\nPathirana also urged the public to refer to the Ministry of Health\u2019s precautions listed here in order to minimize the risk of coronavirus.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the official guidelines:", "lang": "en"}
