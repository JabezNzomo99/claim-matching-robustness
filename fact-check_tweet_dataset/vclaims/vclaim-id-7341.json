Her tweet has been liked by over 800 people and retweeted 225 times.\n\nThe images shared by Mitra was posted by the Twitter handle @DrGPradhan, who is followed by Prime Minister Modi, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal\u2019s office and newly appointed RBI Director S Gurumurthy. His on the nose tweet been retweeted 1,899 times.\n\nThe identical set of images was also shared by Facebook page The Youth, with the caption that \u201cmedia will never show this\u201d. The post has been shared by over 1,500 people, including a Twitter handle followed by Goyal\u2019s office. The user describes himself as a \u201cswayamsevak\u201d.\n\nThe new Facebook page of rumour mongering website Postcard News, Post Card Fans, also circulated the image with the similar \u201cmedia will never show this\u201d narrative.\n\nIronically, Postcard News had shared the same photographs in September 2016 as RSS workers helping Bihar flood victims, along with their repetitious narrative against media.\n\nAlt News also found multiple users on social media who shared these identical images between August 27 and August 28, 2016, as West Bengal floods that same year (1,2,3, 4).\n\nBoth West Bengal and Bihar faced severe flooding in August 2016. However, we could not independently confirm whether these viral images of RSS worker providing aid was taken during floods in either of the two states. However, it is clear that the photographs do not pertain to the recent flooding in Kerala.\n\nOld images of RSS aid work are oftentimes circulated as a part of recent events. In an earlier article, Alt News reported how images of 2017 Gujarat floods were viral on social media as RSS aid work during recent Kerala floods.\n\nThe official Facebook page of RSS also circulated an old image as recent Kerala floods and rectified the same after Alt New\u2019s article.\n\nThe death toll in devastating Kerala floods has crossed the 300-mark. In situations of such distress and panic, circulating old/unrelated images for propaganda is an insensitive tactic to gain commendation.", "lang": "en"}
