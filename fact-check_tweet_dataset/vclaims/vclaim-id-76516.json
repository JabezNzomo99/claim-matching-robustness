The police ruled it as suicide.\n\n\n\nIn 2019, the Press Council of India (PCI) issues a set of guidelines regarding reporting on suicides. According to the guidelines, the following are to be avoided:\n\u2022 Publish stories about suicide prominently and unduly repeat such stories\n\u2022 Use language which sensationalize or normalizes suicide, or presents it as a constructive solution to problems\n\nThe media coverage of Rajput's suicide was found to flout most of these guidelines.\n\nIn 2016, Rajput took on the role of former Indian cricket team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the biopic MS Dhoni - The Untold Story. This led some news channels to use cricketing terminology to create highly sensational headlines.\n\n\n\nZee News put out a tweet with the caption, \"\u092b\u093f\u0932\u094d\u092e\u0940 \u0915\u093e '\u0927\u094b\u0928\u0940' \u0905\u0938\u0932 \u091c\u093c\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0917\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0902 '\u0906\u0909\u091f' \u0915\u0948\u0938\u0947?\" (How did the Dhoni of cinemas get \"out\" in real life?)\n\n\n\nAaj Tak also put out a similar caption in the ticker, stating, \"How did Sushant get a \"hit wicket\"?\" This was called out by many Twitter users, with the hashtag #ShameOnAajTak trending on the micro-blogging platform.\n\n\n\nZee News also put out another sensational headline : \"How did Sushant from Patna fail in Mumbai?\"\n\nABP News was also found sensationalising the matter by using a reference Kai Po Che (a kiting term used in Gujarat which means \"I have cut it\", referring to the act of cutting the strings of another kite), another film which stars Rajput. ABP's headline said, \"\u0938\u093e\u0902\u0938\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0940 \u0921\u094b\u0930... \u0915\u093e\u0908 \u092a\u094b \u091a\u0947 \u0939\u094b \u0917\u092f\" (The strings of breath... became Kai Po Che).\n\nThe above examples of reporting are strictly in conflict with the guidelines presented by PCI, especially with regards to point 2 and 5 (Use language which sensationalize or normalizes suicide; using sensational headlines).\n\nPictures of Rajput lying dead in his bed has also been circulated on social media, which ended up being used by News Nation in their coverage of Rajput's death. This was called out by actor Vikrant Massey, who posted a screengrab of News Nation's segment on the matter.\n\nUsing such photos while reporting on suicide is an infringement of point 6 of the guideline.\n\nMaharashtra Cyber, Maharashtra Government's Nodal office for Cyber Crime investigation, put out a thread on Twitter, warning people against sharing the images of the deceased actor.\n\nPoint 3 of the PCI guidelines advise against explicitly describing the method of suicide. Aaj Tak was found flouting this rule in their coverage, by using a headline which explicitly described the method of suicide used.\n\n\n\nAaj Tak was also found using the hashtag #SushantSinghRajput to push out an unrelated tweet around COVID-19 cases in Delhi. This is an infringement of point 1 of the guidelines (publish stories about suicide prominently and unduly repeat such stories).\n\nNetizens also criticised Aaj Tak for seeking out a comment from the actor's relatives in Bihar, which showed his father - who seemed shell-shocked from the news.\n\nNote: If you are in need of support, or know someone who does, do not hesitate to reach out to one of the helplines below:\n\u2022 iCall: (555)123-4567 (Available from Monday to Saturday: 8:00am to 10:00pm)", "lang": "en"}
