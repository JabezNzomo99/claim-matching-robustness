Radtke, a Tea Party activist who is seeking next year\u2019s GOP Senate nomination, called Webb\u2019s retirement \"a great opportunity to change the direction of our country.\"\n\n \n\n \"Senator Webb was a reliable vote for President Obama and Senator Harry Reid and their ruinous agenda,\" Radtke said in a written statement released on Feb. 11, the day Webb made announcement.\n\n \n\n Webb, a former Republican turned Democrat, has always had a reputation for charting his own course. We wondered how much he was in sync with Obama and Reid, a Nevada Democrat who is Senate majority leader.\n\n \n\n We turned to the voting records.\n\n \n\n According to data compiled by non-partisan OpenCongress, Webb and Reid have voted together 1,325 times since Jan. 2007, when Webb joined the Senate. They have a \"voting similarity\" of 85 percent, according to the web site. Democratic senators average an 89 percent voting similarity.\n\n \n\n The Washington Post also maintains an exhaustive congressional database. It shows Webb voted with a majority of Democratic senators 87 percent of the time during last Congress from 2009-11. Reid, during the same span, voted with his party 95 percent of the time.\n\n \n\n The Post\u2019s review of the 111th Congress includes 689 votes. Many were not controversial and supported by both sides of the aisle.\n\n \n\n We looked at Webb\u2019s record on President Barack Obama\u2019s key initiatives. Webb and Reid were always in his corner. They voted for:\n\u2022 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, better known as health care reform.\n\u2022 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, or stimulus bill.\n\u2022 The New START nuclear arms agreement with Russia.\n\u2022 The repeal of \"Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell,\" a policy barring openly gay men and women from the military.\n\u2022 The DREAM Act, which would grant citizenship to undocumented immigrants who serve in the military or attend college.\n\u2022 The deal between Obama and Congressional Republicans that extended the Bush-era tax cuts and added some payroll tax reductions.\n\u2022 The Supreme Court nominations of Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor.\n\nIt is worth noting that Webb, despite supporting the president and his party on a very consistent basis, has been scored as one of the more contrarian Democrats by Congressional Quarterly. In the 111th Congress only five other senators went against the party\u2019s majority more often than Webb did. But voting with your party 87 percent of the time still sounds consistent to us.\n\nBut voting with your party 87 percent of the time still sounds consistent to us. And on the highest-profile issues, Webb and Reid have backed the president.", "lang": "en"}
