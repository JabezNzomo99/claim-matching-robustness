According to claims, the order was issued by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) on August 20, 2020.\n\nOne such claim posted on Facebook with an IRDAI circular reads, \u201cPlease be informed that for all insurance claims valid *pollution certificate* is mandatory. If the vehicle's pollution certificate validity is expired during the time of accident insurance companies will not cover the accident damages hereafter *20th August 2020*.\u201d\n\nPUC certification determines if a vehicle's smoke emission level meets pollution control standards set by the Indian government.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claim is misleading. IRDAI did not issue a circular saying insurance companies will not cover accident damages to a vehicle if the validity of the PUC certificate is expired at the time of the accident.\n\nThe archived versions of similar claims can be seen here, here, and here.\n\nIRDAI issued a new circular on August 20, 2020, to insurance providers in India directing them to obtain valid PUC certificate for a vehicle while renewing the insurance policy. This circular is available on IRDAI\u2019s official website.\n\nWe also came to understand that the same circular is making rounds on social media with the viral claim.\n\nHowever, the circular does not mention the non-payment of a claim amount for damaged vehicles with expired PUC certificates.\n\nWe also found media reports regarding the IRDAI\u2019s circular.\n\nAccording to these reports, this circular was only reasserting a Supreme Court direction of 2018 which stated that insurers must not renew motor policies until vehicle owners provide a valid PUC certificate.\n\nThe official Facebook page of the Motor Vehicle Department (MVD) of the Kerala government has also dismissed the viral claim calling it a misinterpretation of the IRDAI circular.\n\nThe statement by MVD reads, \u201cThe claim that insurance companies will not cover the accident damages if the validity of vehicles\u2019 pollution certificate is expired during the time of the accident is false. If a person is given policy by an insurance company, it means that the policyholder has a valid PUC on the day the policy starts.\n\nThe company cannot deny insurance later. However, it is the responsibility of the citizens to keep the PUC always renewed.\u201d\n\nHence, the IRDAI circular to insurance companies only made PUC certificate mandatory for insurance renewal.", "lang": "en"}
