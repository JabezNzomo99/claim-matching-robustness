The article decried the building of \u201cshanty town\u201d villages in one of \u201cEurope\u2019s great cities,\u201d even as human rights groups pointed out that Roma people are European Union citizens.\n\nDuring his visit to California, Trump struck a similar tone, criticizing California for an ongoing housing crisis and stating that homeless people are occupying \u201cour best highways, our best streets, our best entrances to buildings.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\u2019s major cities are indeed experiencing a rise in homelessness, driven largely by a lack of affordable housing. But the above image does not depict Los Angeles, nor was it taken in 2019. Therefore we rate this claim \u201cMiscaptioned.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
