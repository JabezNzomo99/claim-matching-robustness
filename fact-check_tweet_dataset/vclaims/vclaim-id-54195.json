{"title": "FALSE: Supreme Court affirms ABS-CBN guilty, shuts down network", "subtitle": "There is no guilty ruling from the SC, and it was the NTC that shut down the network", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "Jul 21, 2020 3:38 PM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-54195", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/supreme-court-affirms-abs-cbn-guilty-shuts-down-network", "vclaim": "The video was spotted on YouTube by the Rappler team as a related link to a previous video by Showbiz Fanaticz that we also debunked. As of writing, it has had 17,740 views. Showbiz Fanaticz has over 212,000 subscribers on the platform.\n\nThe SC did not hand down a guilty ruling over ABS-CBN. It was the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) that issued a cease and desist order against the network, which effectively shut down its operations after the House of Representatives failed to deliberate on the network's franchise renewal before it expired on May 4.\n\nMoreover, the GMA News report cited by the video wasn\u2019t referring to the SC, but was about the rejection on July 10 of ABS-CBN\u2019s franchise application by the House panel on legislative franchises. The article of GMA News can be found here.\n\nThe only cases pending in the SC that are related to the media network are its petition for temporary restraining order vs the NTC's cease and desist order, and the quo warranto petition filed by Solicitor General Jose Calida vs ABS-CBN Convergence. Calida's quo warranto petition vs ABS-CBN Corporation was already junked on June 23 for being moot because ABS-CBN's franchise already expired on May 4.\n\nABS-CBN Corporation filed the petition with the SC on May 7. By August 4, the broadcasting network would be closed for 3 months already.
