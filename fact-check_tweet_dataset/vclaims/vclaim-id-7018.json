The stuffed and stoned marijuana leaf in this picture is not a product from Fisher-Price; it is a product from an Etsy shop called, appropriately, \u201cDooby\u2019sDogToys\u201d:\n\nDespite a few obvious hints that this is a joke (the \u201cTiny Toker\u201d is sold at \u201cWorst Buy\u201d instead of \u201cBest Buy,\u201d for example), some on social media presented this image as if it were a real toy set:\n\nThe toy company fisher price released a \u201d tiny toker \u201d toy set \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it\u2019s a mini plastic bong , pipe and stuffed lighter and stuffed cannabis leaf with a little smiley face on it and plastic weed to load in the bong . ( was taken off shelfs 2months after release ) but still really ?! Now all that know me know I\u2019m 420 friendly but god sakes ages 5-10 should not be playing with that at all . Smh. Weed isn\u2019t a toy . Next they\u2019re gonna release teeny tweaker sets coming with spoofs and fake rocks and stuffed torches or my alcoholic sets instead of tea party sets . Giving out plastic shot glasses and fake whiskey \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f crazy what the worlds coming too .\n\nHowever, this product was never sold in stores, because this product was never manufactured by Fisher-Price. This image was created by @sean_speezy (a watermark can be spotted in the top left corner of the meme), who frequently posts amusing but fabricated stoner-themed products to their Instagram page:\n\nIn 2016, some corners of the Internet were quite outraged when people came across a \u201cHappy Hour Playset\u201d featuring a child-sized bar, beer bottles, and a grumpy-looking baby bartender. This, too, was a hoax.", "lang": "en"}
