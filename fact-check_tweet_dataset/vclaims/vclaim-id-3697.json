I mean, we write them, but they're just so easy. Such is the case with a passenger plane full of illegals who tried to skydive to safety and landed inside a prison. 23 illegal immigrants were detained by ICE early Saturday morning after an ill-fated parachute jump from a plane flying across the border. The 20 men and 3 women apparently paid a hefty price to be allowed to jump from the plane (the \"coyote\" flying it was found with 143,627 pesos on him), but they landed in another place where they will pay a hefty price -- La Maga Laro State Prison, which sits along a length of existing border fence. There was \"some confusion\" according to prison warden Martin Shanks, but \"the attempted border crossers were swiftly rounded up and ICE was contacted immediately.\"\n\nThere are several clues hidden in the story that tell you it is fake. First of all, WQRT isn't even a station in New Mexico, it serves Indianapolis. Secondly, there is no \"La Maga Laro State Prison\" but \"La Maga Laro\" is an anagram for \"Mar-a-Lago\", the location of President Trump's Florida vacation home and golf club. Finally: in this earlier article debunking rumors about a \"truckload of illegals\" voting coming from the same website I jokingly remarked:\n\nIt seems that has now happened and by a remarkable coincidence that prison warden's name \"Martin Shanks\" sounds suspiciously similar to my own name...\n\nThe site Daily World Update comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites such as ladiesofliberty.net, shareotonin.com and dailyworldupdate.com. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". He has at least one accomplice who writes under the pen names \"Freedom\", \"Captain Jellypants\", \"Butch Mannington\" or \"Captain Buck Atlantis\".\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.", "lang": "en"}
