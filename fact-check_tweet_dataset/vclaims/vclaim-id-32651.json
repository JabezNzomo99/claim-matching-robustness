This claim is false; Sri Lanka Police said the driver was charged with a traffic violation after allegedly hanging garlands on his rear view mirror, obstructing his line of sight. The alleged offence did not relate to the Buddha figurine being displayed on the dashboard, police said.\n\nThe images were published in this Facebook post on October 18, 2019.\n\nIt has been shared more than 6,500 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Facebook post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Sinhala-language caption translates to English as: \u201cBuddha statue on the dashboard also fined...Plight of Lanka\u201d.\n\nThe first image shows a small Buddha figurine on a vehicle dashboard. The second image shows a permit issued by Sri Lanka Police to a motorist found guilty of committing a traffic violation.\n\nThe permit, written in Sinhala language, lists \u201cdriving with fixtures\u201d as the traffic violation. It states it was issued by the Maradana Police traffic branch on October 17, 2019.\n\nThe same images were published here, here and here, on Facebook with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; Sri Lanka Police said in an official statement that the driver\u2019s offence did not relate to the Buddha figurine.\n\nSri Lanka Police published an official statement about the incident here on Facebook and here on Twitter on October 22, 2019.\n\nThe first three paragraphs of the Sinhala-language statement on Facebook translate to English as: \u201cWith regard to false news circulating on social media sites about a vehicle traffic police officer instructing the removal of a Buddha statue fixed in a motor vehicle.\n\n\u201cA few days ago, an individual had released a video to social media sites, claiming a police officer asked a Buddha statue in the individual\u2019s motor vehicle to be removed.\n\n\u201cIn the investigation undertaken by Director -- traffic and road safety of Police Headquarters, Indika Hapugoda as per the instructions of the Inspector General of Police, it was revealed that the officer had only instructed for the garlands placed on the rear view mirror obstructing the main windscreen, to be removed. The officer had not in any instance instructed the driver to remove the Buddha statue.\"\n\nThe communique issued by Sri Lanka Police further notes that statements have been obtained by four individuals as well as the individual to whom the permit was issued, with regard to the false claims on social media.\n\n\u201cAll of their testimonies confirm the police officer never asked for the Buddha statue to be removed,\u201d the statement adds.\n\nIt also emphasises that displaying fixtures in a way that blocks the front windscreen view or placing fixtures on the dashboard, may result in an obstruction of the front view and result in motor accidents.\n\n\u201cThe driver was informed of his wrongdoing and instructed to remove the garlands and flower vases hanged on the rear view mirror. But the driver has misinterpreted the instructions in a video and claimed the officer asked for the Buddha statue to be removed,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nCircular 38/2013 issued on motor vehicle instructions clearly states in 1: 2 Regulation 5, pertaining to fixtures, that no object or fixture should be displayed in a way that blocks the driver\u2019s line of sight.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the circular; the relevant regulation has been highlighted by AFP in red:\n\nHere is an AFP report published on October 22, 2019, about the false news that was propagated on the traffic violation charge.\n\nIn the official statement issued by Sri Lanka Police, it is also noted that legal action could follow against the individual who made the false claim and against those who shared the claim on social media sites.\n\nThe investigation will determine whether they incited racial and communal hatred with their social media posts, violating the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act No. 56 of 2007.", "lang": "en"}
