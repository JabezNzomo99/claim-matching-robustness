It is a war monument built to honour those of the erstwhile British Indian Army soldiers who fell in World War 1.\n\nAs written at the summit India Gate itself:\n\nTO THE DEAD OF THE INDIAN ARMIES WHO FELL AND ARE HONOURED IN FRANCE AND FLANDERS MESOPOTAMIA AND PERSIA EAST AFRICA GALLIPOLI AND ELSEWHERE IN THE NEAR AND THE FAR-EAST AND IN SACRED MEMORY ALSO OF THOSE WHOSE NAMES ARE HERE RECORDED AND WHO FELL IN INDIA OR THE NORTH-WEST FRONTIER AND DURING THE THIRD AFGHAN WAR\n\nAdditionally, the peak of the monument consists of the words 'India', next to which are the inscriptions:\n\u2022 MCMXIV - roman numeral for 1914 to the left\n\u2022 MCMXIX - roman numeral for 1919 to the right\n\nThese are the years associated with World War 1.\n\nBoth the inscription quoted above and the the can be viewed in the following image of the inscriptions at the summit of the monument:\n\nThe foundation of India Gate was laid by the Duke of Connaught in 1921, and was designed by Edward Lutyens .It was inaugurated a decade after that by then Viceroy Lord Irwin. These events transpired before independence, which was attained in 1947, implying that the monument cannot be dedicated to freedom fighters.\n\nNames Inscribed On The Walls of India Gate\n\nIndia Gate being a World War 1 era monument means that India was then part of the British Commonwealth. India Gate bears the name of not only Indian soldiers, but also those of the United Kingdom and Australia.\n\nThere are 13,216 names inscribed in total. A full database of these names can be found with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC), an international organisation responsible for identifying and maintaining the graves of soldiers from Commonwealth soldiers who lost their lives in both World Wars. India provided funding to this organisation in 2015/16, as per their website.\n\nWhile the CWGC provides holistic information on the names of the soldiers inscribed on the India Gate, it makes no mention of their religion. This is in line with their principles, where they state :\n\nBOOM checked the following two sources to debunk what is being circulated through these images:\n\u2022 The official website of Delhi Tourism.\n\u2022 CWGC data, which can be found and downloaded here.\n\nTherefore, there is no evidence to show that 95,300 names are inscribed on the India Gate or that a majority of them inscribed are Muslim.", "lang": "en"}
