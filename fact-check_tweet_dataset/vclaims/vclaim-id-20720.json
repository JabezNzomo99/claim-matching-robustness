Authorities say their investigation revealed no such criminal activity.\n\nHi, would like your help with this story found on Facebook.\n\n\u201cBREAKING: CHILD RAPE CAMP DISCOVERED NEAR TUCSON \u2013 PRISON CELL MADE FOR CHILDREN \u2013 RAPE TREE \u2013 CHILDREN\u2019S TOYS \u2013 MASSIVE COVER-UP BY CITY OFFICIALS\u2026\u201d\n\nThank you so much!\n\nThe recent discovery of a homeless encampment in Tucson, Arizona, has become material for the latest viral conspiracy theory, one that claims the site was used for child trafficking and as a \u201crape camp.\u201d\n\nBut the Tucson Police Department has said its dayslong investigation yielded no evidence of such criminal activity \u2014 and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement told FactCheck.org it \u201cconcurred with\u201d that conclusion.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere were no obvious signs of any criminal activity out there \u2014 besides trespassing on private property,\u201d Tucson Police Sgt. Pete Dugan told us in a June 7 interview, emphasizing there were no indications \u201cof human trafficking or child sex trafficking.\u201d\n\nThe site has been turned over to the property owner, Dugan said.\n\nStill, unsubstantiated claims of nefarious activity have been widespread \u2014 making their way into reports by news organizations and onto a slew of questionable websites, including some that have tried connecting the conspiracy theory to the Clintons.\n\nThe strange tale began May 29, when police responded to the site, near West Valencia Road and Interstate Highway 19. A homeless veterans group \u201chad discovered the site and expressed concerns\u201d about it, the police said.\n\nThat group, Veterans on Patrol, headed by Michael Lewis Arthur Meyer, has posted a flurry of Facebook videos referring to #OperationBackyardBrawl. In the videos, Meyer speculates about the activity at the site (he calls it a \u201cchild sex camp\u201d) and rejects the conclusions of authorities who have said otherwise (he says, \u201cthe experts from the government, they\u2019re full of s\u2014\u201d).\n\nIn the days after the initial discovery, local media reported on the unfounded claims. A June 1 headline on Patch.com read, \u201cUnderground Tucson Bunker Possibly Used In Child Sex Trafficking.\u201d\n\nLocal station KGUN-TV labeled its segment \u201cUnderground Bunker Found,\u201d as part of the \u201cKGUN9 Child Trafficking Series.\u201d And News 4 Tucson (KVOA-TV) aired a segment \u2014 titled on YouTube \u201cHomeless camp or child trafficking den?\u201d \u2014 that was preceded by an anchor asking, \u201cIs it an abandoned homeless camp or is it something more sinister?\u201d\n\nThe latter report showed viewers a number of seemingly benign findings at the camp: a mirror, a table with shaving cream and flea shampoo, as well as an area \u201cwhere people probably slept.\u201d It then showed \u201cstraps\u201d on trees and a \u201cbunker\u201d with a small opening, and later mentioned children\u2019s items, such as toys and clothes.\n\n\u201cThis place is meant for child trafficking \u2014 it\u2019s meant for torturous, terrible things,\u201d a volunteer with the veterans group said in that News 4 report.\n\nDugan, however, said that \u201cthe items that we found there are just not uncommon from what we see at other camps around the town and county.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust because they\u2019re homeless doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t use a mirror,\u201d he added.\n\nAs for the straps found on trees, Dugan said authorities \u201chave seen similar types of things\u201d at other homeless camps, and they are sometimes used to hang food out of the reach of animals.\n\nICE, in a statement provided by a spokeswoman, said that \u201cspecial agents who specialize in human smuggling and human trafficking collaborated with the Tucson Police Department on the information collected from the scene.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on the information provided by TPD,\u201d the agency said, it \u201cconcurred with the police department\u2019s findings that nothing at the site validates the claims of possible human trafficking or child sex trafficking.\u201d\n\nOne video about the conspiracy theory, posted on the Facebook page \u201cStranger Than Fiction News,\u201d received 41,000 shares. It referred to the matter as a \u201cmassive cover-up by city officials.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople need to know we investigated it from the first report and continued to investigate it for days after,\u201d Dugan told us, adding that the department continues to encourage residents to report perceived suspicious activity.\n\nAttempts to connect the camp to the Clintons echoed the debunked \u201cPizzagate\u201d conspiracy theory, which posited that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was operating a child sex ring out of a Washington, D.C., pizza shop. Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton lamented the most recent conspiracy, referring to it on Twitter as \u201c#Pizzagate 2.0.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\nMack, Lauren.
