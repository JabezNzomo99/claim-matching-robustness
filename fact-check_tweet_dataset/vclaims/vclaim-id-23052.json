The video is 24 seconds long, and shows two cars running parallel to each other. From the car on the left, a man can be seen extending his torso out of the window and brandishing what appears to be a gun, pointed at the driver of the second car.\n\nThe video has also been shared with a message in English, which states that it shows \u201cbrazen display of illegal weapon by criminals\u201d.\n\nThe claim circulating on social media platforms is false. The video in question represents neither a robbery nor an illegal display of weapons. Noida police and UP police were tagged along with the video on Twitter. Noida police clarified by responding that the incident represents a video shoot which was conducted by some persons for their YouTube channel, and that persons in the two vehicles were friends and were simply indulging in stunts. Police added that legal action is being taken against them for their \u201cact of creating nuisance in public\u201d.\n\nIt may be reiterated that the video in question was created for a YouTube channel.", "lang": "en"}
