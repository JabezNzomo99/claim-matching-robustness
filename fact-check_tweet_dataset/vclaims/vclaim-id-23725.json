No, that's not true: This video shows military artillery firing missiles during a training exercise at Polessky firing range in the Republic of Belarus in March 2014.\n\nThe false claim circulated on social media after Palestinians fired hundreds of rockets from Gaza into Israel on May 4 and 5, 2019, including a post (archived here) where it was published on May 5, 2019. It read:\n\nPalestinian terrorists in Gaza have fires some 500 rockets into civilian areas in Israel. \n\n A 25-year-old man from the city of Ashdod, Pinchas Pshevizman, was killed. \n\n Send the video around the world to see what we have to deal with, and then they accuse us of violence and disproportionate response.\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nSome well-connected Americans fell for the hoax, including former Trump campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson, who used the fake video in a tweet to attack U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar.\n\nWhile there was certainly violence directed at Israel from Gaza, it was in the form of lesser rockets than the video depicts, which makes this fake news.\n\nNot convinced? Here is a video of the same rocket firing at the same location. In case you don't read Russian, it is titled \"Volley of the Hurricane Division.\"\n\nCredit is due to Bellingcat researcher Alec Toler for tracking this video down:", "lang": "en"}
