(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nSearching online and on the Nexis database of news articles, we found no evidence that such an Army sergeant murdered two Syrians who raped his daughter. Our efforts to uncover news about Hayes and such an attack instead turned up a 2010 Fox News story about a man named Steven Hayes convicted of murder and sexual assault in the killing of a mother and her two daughters. We also found a 2009 obituary for Gregory Hayes, a police sergeant who once served in the Army. But the photo that ran with the obit doesn\u2019t match the photo in the Facebook post, nor do any news stories tie that Hayes to the one garnering support on social media.\n\nIt seems that\u2019s because the grisly tale of rape, murder and vengence described online is fabricated. We rate this Facebook post as False.", "lang": "en"}
