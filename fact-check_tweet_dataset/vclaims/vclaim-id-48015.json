And I\u2019m telling you, foreign nations, foreign people looking at us, they honestly think we\u2019re nuts. And then you have presidents and saying nothing was wrong. \u2026 But Nancy Pelosi said, \u2018Well, that\u2019s what he said. Isn\u2019t it?\u2019 But she was angry as hell when she got to read the transcript. Because she said, \u2018Wait a minute, that\u2019s not what I was told.\u2019 But she was stuck, she was stuck.\u201d\n\nIn our database of President Trump\u2019s false or misleading claims, we\u2019ve documented how he twists things out of proportion or simply invents stories out of whole cloth. Sometimes, he even goes through a time warp. All of these elements are present in this pair of statements, which are similar or identical to other statements he made over the weekend at various events or media availabilities.\n\nBut the president wants his supporters to believe that the complaint falsely portrayed the phone call so he can explain why, in his words, the man leading the impeachment investigation \u201cmade up\u201d a conversation and the House speaker supposedly was upset when she saw the actual transcript. In an added twist, Trump sometimes tries to adjust the time frame to make his point appear even more dramatic.\n\nThere is no exact transcript of the conversation \u2014 in which Trump urged an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden, a potential 2020 election rival \u2014 as the summary was cobbled together from notes by White House officials. So Schiff told the audience that \u201cthis is the essence of what the president communicates\u201d and that he would describe \u201cin sum and character, what the president was trying to communicate.\u201d That was a signal to listeners that he was not quoting verbatim from the rough transcription. Nevertheless, Schiff included some eyebrow-raising embellishments.\n\nThis is where Schiff gave Trump an opening for attack. Biden\u2019s name came up twice in the call, not seven times. The president also urged a probe into the discredited conspiracy theory that a private company had a role in starting the \u201cRussian hoax\u201d because supposedly a Democratic National Committee server has been spirited to Ukraine. Trump also said three times that his lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani or Attorney General William P. Barr would get in contact with Zelensky. So there were a number of requests \u2014 ABC News counted eight \u2014 but not seven about Biden. Trump also did not request that Zelenksy \u201cmake up dirt\u201d on Biden.\n\nTrump has taken this inaccurate account by Schiff and run hard with it. (Never mind the fact that Trump routinely embellishes his \u201cfacts.\u201d) He has even declared that Schiff was guilty of a \u201ccrime\u201d and should be tried for \u201ctreason\u201d or even \u201cimpeached,\u201d even though members of Congress cannot be impeached.\n\u2022 None \u201cHe made a conversation that didn\u2019t exist. He never thought in a million years that I was going to release the real conversation. And when it did, the whistleblower turned out to be totally inaccurate.\u201d (Oct. 12, Fox Interview)\n\u2022 None \u201cThis crooked Adam Schiff made a statement \u2014 long, beautiful statement \u2014 and it was a fraud. He repeated my call, but it wasn\u2019t me. He made it so bad. \u2026 But then I did something that they didn\u2019t expect. I immediately called up Ukraine, through my representatives. \u2026 I got approval to immediately make that call public. \u2026 By the way, he only did it because he never thought that I was going to release the transcript. \u2026 He did it and then I released the transcript. They never thought in a million years, even in terms of violation with another country, but we got approval.\u201d (Oct. 12, Value Voters summit)\n\u2022 None \u201cWhen Schiff goes out and speaks before Congress, they never thought I was going to release the transcript of my call.\u201d (Oct. 11, campaign rally in Lake Charles, La.)\n\u2022 None \u201cDemocrat\u2019s game was foiled when we caught Schiff fraudulently making up my Ukraine conversation, when I released the exact conversation Transcript.\u201d (Oct. 14, tweet)\n\nBut this is totally mixed up. The rough transcript \u2014 which the White House acknowledged was not verbatim \u2014 was released on Sept. 25 and Schiff held the hearing on Sept. 26. Republicans at the hearing were able to call out Schiff\u2019s embellishments precisely because they had the recorded words in front of them.\n\u2022 None \u201cThey came out with a whistleblower report before they saw the conversation. Had they waited one day, Nancy Pelosi wouldn\u2019t have made a fool out of herself, and she would have been able to say what I said. Because when she saw it, she said, \u2018This is not what the whistleblower said.\u2019 \u201d (Oct. 7, remarks at White House)\n\u2022 None \u201cNancy Pelosi said, a day before seeing the transcript of the call with the Ukrainian President, 'We\u2019ve got to impeach him. We\u2019ve got to impeach him, right?\u2019 And then she saw the call and she said to her people, \u2018What the hell? Nobody ever told me this was the call.\u2019 But she keeps going anyway because the press is fake, and they play right into their head.\u201d (Oct. 10, Minneapolis campaign rally)\n\u2022 None Nancy Pelosi said, \u2018Well, that\u2019s what he said. Isn\u2019t it?\u2019 But she was angry as hell when she got to read the transcript. Because she said, \u2018Wait a minute, that\u2019s not what I was told.\u2019 But she was stuck, she was stuck.\u201d (Oct. 11, Lake Charles, La., campaign rally)\n\u2022 None \u201cIt was a terrible, terrible fraudulent thing. And then Nancy Pelosi went on television. She was very angry when she read the actual call, because this was an exact \u2014 I guess stenographers, they took it down. And she was very angry because she got led \u2014 she was a day early when she started talking about impeachment.\u201d (Oct. 12, Value Voters summit)\n\nWhen the rough transcript was released, Pelosi\u2019s assessment was tough: \u201cThe release of the notes of the call by the White House confirms that the President engaged in behavior that undermines the integrity of our elections, the dignity of the office he holds and our national security. The President has tried to make lawlessness a virtue in America and now is exporting it abroad.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
