But the article left out other key conditions, including that elections in Donbas must be held according to Ukrainian law, allowing Ukrainian political parties to participate. Last November, the leaders of the Russian-controlled territories in Donbas held their own elections, despite objections and condemnation by both Kyiv and Western governments. None of the internationally recognized election observation missions, such as the OSCE, monitored those elections, meaning those votes did not allow the Russian-controlled territories in Donbas to qualify for special status under the Steinmeier formula.\n\nMore importantly, the same day the TASS report was published, Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said that his country had already agreed to the text of the Steinmeier formula on September 2, even though it had not yet formally signed it.\n\n\"It is necessary that all parties represented at this table, all media represented here, have access to the elections, and so on,\u201d Prystaiko said, according to the Ukrainian news outlet UNIAN. \u201cOnly then can the elections be recognized as corresponding to OSCE standards.\"\n\nThe TASS article left out key details of the \u201cSteinmeier formula,\u201d specifically, the conditions of its implementation requiring Russia\u2019s own compliance.", "lang": "en"}
