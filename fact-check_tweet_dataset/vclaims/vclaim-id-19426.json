And now, a set of three photographs showing alleged police brutality on women is being shared widely as that from the Valley.\n\nFacebook user \"Fazlul Hoque Patowary\" shared three pictures in a group called \"Deen E Islam\". The three pictures show police misbehaving with women.\n\nThe caption with the post says, \"Current situation of Kashmir! Plz pray for them.\" Till the time of filing this story, the post has been shared more than 100 times. The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the images are not recent. These images are from separate incidents and clicked in different years.\n\nAFWA used reverse image search to unveil the truth.\n\nThis image showing a policeman pulling the dupatta of a woman was traced to a blog published on January 3, 2011. The blog, titled \"Genocide in Kashmir\", talks about the situation of the Valley at that time. We were unable to confirm whether the image was clicked in Kashmir.\n\nThis photo showing a policeman kicking a woman is around three years old. We found this image in a photo gallery posted by local news website Greater Kashmir.\n\nThe caption of the photo reads: \"A policeman kicks a woman for resisting their attempts to snatch body of slain Kulgam youth from protesters at Zampa Kadal on Saturday. Aman Farooq/GK\"\n\nThis picture of a woman touching the feet of a policeman was clicked on May 17, 2004. We found this image on Shutterstock with the image credit to Altaf Qadri.\n\nThe content of the page is restricted on the website but Google's cache for this page can be seen here.\n\nThe caption to the image says, \"Sameena Sister of Rafiq Ahmad Throws Her Veil at a Police Officer's Feet Begging Him for the Release of Her Brother during a Demonstration for His Release.\"\n\nWe could not confirm whether this picture was from Kashmir.\n\nThus, it is clear that none of the three images are recent visuals from the Valley.", "lang": "en"}
