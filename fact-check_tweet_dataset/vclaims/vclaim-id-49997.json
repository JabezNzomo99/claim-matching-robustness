She was known for her huge heart and good nature, despite all of her health problems. She had nearly died as a child, but developed a strength and love of life that made everyone around her smile. So then why in God\u2019s name did her mother take her to a \u2018COVID Party\u2019 at their church on June 10 to intentionally expose her immuno-compromised daughter to this virus? \u2026 On June 10, Carysn\u2019s [sic] mom, Carole, took Carsyn, a 16-year-old girl who was immuno-compromised with a history of health issues (including cancer), to a \u2018COVID party\u2019 at her church, where more than 100 children without masks were in attendance.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cCOVID party\u201d claim was subsequently repeated in articles and posts published by Newsweek, the Daily Kos, and Alternet.\n\nDavis did die of complications from COVID-19, with several underlying health problems as contributory causes. On June 10, she did attend an event at her local youth church at the First Assembly of God in Fort Myers. However, reports that it was a \u201cCOVID party\u201d were inaccurate and based on a gross misrepresentation of real descriptions of the event.\n\nAn investigations report by the Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner Department provided the following account of Davis\u2019 death:\n\n17 year old female with a complex medical history including opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome (resolved at 5 years of age), hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction, precocious puberty, morbid obesity who present [sic] with respiratory failure. The decedent\u2019s mother and father are a nurse and physician\u2019s assistant, respectively. On June 10, the decedent attended a church function with 100 other children. She did not wear a mask. Social distancing was not followed. The parents prophylactically treated her with azithromycin (6/10-6/15). On June 13, she developed frontal headache, sinus pressure, mild cough. The family thought her symptoms were due to a sinus infection. The symptoms persisted. On June 19, the mother noted she looked \u201cgray\u201d while sleeping. She tested the decedent\u2019s O2 saturation and it was in the 40s. The mother borrowed the decedent\u2019s grandfather\u2019s home oxygen (he has COPD) and her O2 saturation rose to the 60s on 5L. The parents gave her a dose of hydroxychloroquine. The parents took her to Gulf Coast Medical Center and she was transferred to Golisano Hospital PICU. On June 19, 2020, she was found to be positive for SARS CoV-2. Her LFTs [liver function tests] were significantly elevated. The parents declined intubation. The decedent received convalescent plasma therapy on June 20 and 21st. On June 22, 2020 the decedent\u2019s condition had not improved and intubation was required. The decedent was intubated. Her cardiorespiratory status continued to decline. On June 22, 2020, despite aggressive therapy and maneuvers, her best O2 saturation was low 70s. The mother requested heroic efforts despite knowing she had low chance of meaningful survival. Preparations were made to perform ECMO [extracorporeal membrane oxygenation] on the decedent. The decedent was transferred from Golisano Hospital to the Nicklaus Children\u2019s Hospital for ECMO. She was transported without incident directly to the cath lab at Nicklaus Children\u2019s for ECMO cannulation. After cannulation she required escalation of inotropic support and vasopressor support. She was transferred to the PICU after the procedure and continued to deteriorate requiring increasing doses of pressors. Chest X-ray was performed and showed severe bilateral infiltrates and subcutaneous emphysema. She developed worsening distributive shock and multiorgan failure. She was to undergo dialysis and plasmapheresis however due to rapid deterioration and inability to bring up oxygen saturation, these interventions were unable to be performed. Echocardiogram was performed and showed no cardiac function, pupils were 5 mm and fixed. She was pronounced dead on 6/23/2020 at 1306.\n\nThe report specified that Davis\u2019 cause of death was \u201cComplications of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) Pneumonia,\u201d with the following listed as contributory causes: \u201cHypothalamic-Pituitary Axis Dysfunction, Morbid Obesity, Bronchial Asthma.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how or where Davis contracted COVID-19. According to the medical examiner\u2019s report, she first developed symptoms three days after attending a church event with 100 other children. However, COVID-19 symptoms can take between two and 14 days to appear after exposure, so it cannot be assumed that Davis caught the virus at the June 10 church event.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Davis\u2019 parents did attempt to treat her illness with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine, a controversial proposed treatment for COVID-19 that has been touted by President Donald Trump. That aspect of the news reports mentioned above was accurate.\n\nHowever, no evidence has been presented to support the claim that the June 10 church event was billed as a \u201cCOVID party,\u201d or was designed as a forum for young people to intentionally or wantonly expose themselves and others to the disease.\n\nRebekah Jones, a data scientist who was fired by the Florida Department of Health after what the department told Snopes was a \u201ca repeated course of insubordination\u201d and \u201cblatant disrespect\u201d for her colleagues, first uncovered the medical examiner\u2019s report on Davis\u2019 death. (Jones has insisted she was fired for refusing to manipulate COVID-19-related data, while the Associated Press reported she had repeatedly made unauthorized public comments on the state\u2019s COVID-19 data-collection methods.)\n\nThat document was first published on FloridaCovidVictims.com, which is run by Florida Covid Action, an alternative provider of COVID-19 data in Florida, and an initiative by Jones and others.\n\nOn Twitter, Jones posted what appeared to be a screenshot taken from the Facebook page of First Youth Church at the First Assembly of God in Fort Myers \u2014 the Davis family\u2019s church. In a June 10 post, First Youth Church wrote:\n\n\u201cService is back and better than ever! We will be having our Release Party in the gym TONIGHT at 6:45. There will be games, awesome giveaways, free food, a DJ and music, and the start of our new sermon series. AND we\u2019ll be starting Summer Nights afterwords [sic] with karaoke and basketball! We hope to see you there!\u201d\n\nIt was Jones, and not the church itself, who described the June 10 event as a \u201cCOVID party,\u201d and the screenshot, presented as evidence by Jones, actually undermines her own contention that the event attended by Davis and others was a \u201cCOVID party.\u201d The FloridaCovidVictims.com blog post was especially misleading, because it placed quotation marks around the phrase \u201cCOVID party,\u201d falsely indicating that that description originated with the organizers themselves.\n\nOn July 7, in response to the news reports mentioned above, the First Assembly of God posted a strongly worded news release on Facebook, firmly rejecting claims that the church had hosted a \u201cCOVID party\u201d:\n\n\u201cOver the past 24 hours First Assembly of God of Fort Myers has been accused of hosting \u2018COVID-19 parties.\u2019 Nothing could be farther from the truth. First Assembly of God of Fort Myers is following all of the health protections and protocols recommended by the state and local government with regard to holding its church services. Let us be clear \u2014 media reports and postings accusing the church of ignoring protocols or actively engaging in behavior intended to expose our congregation to the virus are absolutely false and defamatory.\u201d\n\nThe statement added that claims of a \u201cCOVID party\u201d were \u201cbased upon irresponsible speculation and inaccurate information.\u201d\n\nAlthough the medical examiner\u2019s report notes that Davis herself did not wear a mask at the June 10 event, it\u2019s unclear whether others did. Snopes sent a list of questions to First Assembly of God officials, including asking what COVID-19 mitigation guidelines or rules, if any, the church had implemented during the \u201cRelease Party.\u201d We did not receive a response of any kind in time for publication.\n\nPastor David Thomas told WBBH that the church had taken unspecified precautions to ensure the safety of children at the event, but that it was left to individual children to decide whether to practice social distancing. This indicates that any official church enforcement of social distancing at the event was relaxed.\n\nAfter initial publication, several news outlets and websites updated their articles to reflect the fact that the characterization of the June 10 event as a \u201cCOVID party\u201d had come from others, and not from the youth church organizers themselves. FloridaCovidVictims.com, whose original blog post formed the basis of several other articles, later removed all references to a \u201cCOVID party,\u201d instead describing the June 10 event as \u201ca large youth event at her church, where more than 100 children without masks were in attendance.\u201d The updated post did not provide evidence to substantiate the claim that the 100 children in attendance did not wear masks.\n\nNewsweek replaced the phrase \u201ccoronavirus party\u201d with \u201cchurch party\u201d in its headline, and Raw Story replaced \u201cchurch \u2018COVID party'\u201d with \u201cchurch event\u201d in its headline, adding the following note: \u201cJones\u2019 analysis of the medical examiner\u2019s report suggested that Davis had intentionally exposed her daughter to the virus at the event, but there\u2019s no additional evidence to support that claim. This report has been updated to reflect subsequent reporting on the teen\u2019s illness.\u201d\n\nAt the time of this Snopes reporting, neither the Daily Kos nor Alternet had published similar updates or corrections.", "lang": "en"}
