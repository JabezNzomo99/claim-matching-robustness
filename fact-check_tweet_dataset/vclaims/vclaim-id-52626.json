Risa Hontiveros has gone viral on social media, as a petition to remove the new mandatory rate for overseas workers\u2019 Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) contribution gained traction.\n\nThe infographic falsely shows a September 2017 photo of Hontiveros superimposed with the fabricated sentence, \u201cKarapat dapat lang patawan ng karagdagan bayad ng mga Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW) ang PHILHEALTH tutal Dollars naman yung kinikita nila (Overseas Filipino Workers [OFWs] deserve the increase in contributions because they earn in dollars).\u201d A breakdown of the important points in the PhilHealth circular on the subject has been attached to the image.\n\nThere are no records of Hontiveros or any lawmaker or official supporting increased health insurance payments. She has denied this in a statement on her official social media accounts, calling the quote card \u201cfake.\u201d\n\nShe instead urged the PhilHealth, the Department of Health and the Philippine Overseas Employment Agency to review the guidelines and consider the \u201ceconomic plight\u201d of OFWs especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe senator has been repeatedly a target of disinformation involving PhilHealth. In 2018, wrong and unsubstantiated online posts implicated Hontiveros in the PhilHealth bonuses controversy. (See: Online posts claiming Hontiveros involved in PhilHealth bonuses mess FALSE)\n\nOn April 2, PhilHealth finalized its guidelines for implementing the new rate of contributions from OFWs from year 2020-2025. From 2.75% per month in 2019, the rate will increase incrementally to 3% in 2020, reaching 5% in 2025.\n\nA change.org petition has been signed by over 300,000 individuals calling on the government to \u201cremove\u201d the 3% mandatory rate, describing it and its corresponding penalties for nonpayment as \u201cunfair.\u201d\n\nOn May 4, PhilHealth president Ricardo Morales said they have already stopped collecting Philhealth contributions due to the pandemic. Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said President Rodrigo Duterte has directed PhilHealth to make contributions of overseas workers voluntary and not mandatory.\n\nThe infographic posted by a netizen on Facebook has been shared almost 500 times on Facebook.", "lang": "en"}
