Despite long-held beliefs that Halloween candy tampering is both commonplace and regularly results in harm to children, reports of actual attempts to do so are virtually non-existent (or based on half-truths).\n\nExcessive concern over colorful drugs (such as strawberry meth) either making their way into the hands of kids or being manufactured to appeal to them isn\u2019t a new concern either: tales circulated in the 1970s claiming LSD merchants were targeting children by peddling their wares via attractive temporary tattoos. By sharp contrast, dire warnings about drugs designed with a candy-like appearance intended to \u201chook\u201d kids have never come true \u2014 which stands to reason, as schoolchildren aren\u2019t the most promising market for illicit recreational drugs. (LSD and MDMA also are largely not addictive substances.)\n\nAs is often the case with such rumors, the public seemed to conflate the existence of a drug that looked child-friendly (such as blue star tattoos, pink meth, or colorful MDMA tablets) with deliberate manufacture of those substances with an intent to attract children. Prior to its September 2015 circulation on social media as a cautionary tale, the photograph of Ecstasy used here appeared primarily on blogs discussing (presumably adult) recreational drug use.\n\nAn important distinction to bear in mind is that the MDMA depicted is not a new form designed to appeal to children: MDMA tablets have historically been produced with a variety of shapes and colors befitting its status as a \u201cparty drug.\u201d Another is that recreational drugs (including MDMA) are generally expensive. The small collection of pills depicted here represents a street value of hundreds of dollars, so the notion that a neighbor would be distributing them to trick-or-treaters for no ostensible reason is rather implausible (especially given how many drug users tend to carefully guard their stashes and often won\u2019t readily share them with friends, much less randomly-selected small children). So while the image of Ecstasy circulating on Facebook might at first appear to represent a true threat to kids on Halloween, there\u2019s little reason to suspect Molly will be lurking in any plastic pumpkins this year.\n\nAnother related rumor warned parents of the potential for deadly, drug-laced, oversized Gummy bears being handed out to unknowing children on Halloween:\n\nThis warning didn\u2019t even specify the name or type of drug that these Gummi bears supposedly harbored, but we\u2019re pretty sure drugs that cause \u201cbrain death and/or death\u201d have few aficionados \u2014 and even fewer repeat users.\n\nNonetheless, on 19 October 2015, police in Jackson, Mississippi, shared the popular \u201cwarning\u201d about MDMA in Halloween candy. That claim was subsequently aggregated to blogs and news web sites as an \u201curgent Halloween warning\u201d from police (not as repetition of a dubious, ancient urban legend):\n\nIn May 2017, a similar warning about \u201cpink teddy bear\u201d ecstasy tablets began spreading on Facebook:\n\nOnce again, images of MDMA tablets were taken out of their original context and presented as a tactic used by drug dealers to entice children. The image of the tablets in a bag first appeared on MDMA-related sites in 2016 (captioned \u201cPurple Bears w/ 180mg MDMA\u201d) aimed not at children, but at users of the substance. In March 2017, the British Sun tabloid utilized the same \u201cstock image\u201d in a news story about four young teenagers hospitalized after purportedly ingesting teddy bear-shaped MDMA tablets:\n\nSky News and the BBC also covered the incident, and all reports indicated the teenagers willingly ingested the \u201cteddy bear ecstasy\u201d as a recreational drug (not because the unknowingly believed it to be candy).", "lang": "en"}
