As described in the Mahabharata. It is real yet the Christian world says there is no proof!\u201d, reads the message posted along with the photos. Dwarka is a popular pilgrimage destination for devotees of Lord Krishna, and is considered to have been the kingdom of Krishna in ancient times.\n\nThe above tweet has been retweeted over 2400 times since it was posted on September 30. There are four images showing elaborate sculpture and architecture, three of which are underwater according to these pictures. Alt News found that three of these pictures had been published by Postcard News in a write-up of January 2018, on the ancient city of Dwarka.\n\nAlt News found that these photos are unrelated to Dwarka. Let us take a look at each of them.\n\nAlt News reverse-searched the above image, and the majority of the results claimed that the photograph pertains to the lost city of Heraclieon of the Egyptian empire. However, the image is from the Neptune Memorial Reef. The Neptune Memorial Reef is an artificially created reef east of Florida, USA. The image had been posted on Facebook in 2012.\n\nAccording to Boom, which contacted the Neptune Memorial Reef, the image of the underwater lion is indeed from there.\n\nOn reverse-searching this image, Alt News found different claims attached to it, ranging from Dwarka to Mahabalipuram. However, several posts claimed that the picture is from Tranquebar in Tamil Nadu. On the basis of this information, Alt News found a picture onFlikr, posted by a user in April 2006.\n\nIt was titled \u2018After the Tsunami\u2019 and captioned, \u201cMind of the observer boggles at this sight. After the Tsunami, in a rural stretch of the Eastern Coramandel Coast of India, of what used to be a Danish Colony some 400 years back. Tarangambadi or Tranquebar (to the Danes), Tamil Nadu, India.\u201d This establishes that the image is from Tamil Nadu and not Dwarka, Gujarat.\n\nA reverse-search of the above image on Google suggested that the picture is from Jamaica in the Caribbean. However, this image too is from the Neptune Memorial Reef in Florida, USA. Similar images are readily available on its website. One such still is posted below. These photographs are also available on a blog about the Neptune Memorial Reef.\n\nNeptune Memorial Reef has also posted a video on YouTube, showing the underwater creation at the site.\n\nAlt News reverse-searched the above image and found several results which suggested that it pertained to the legendary lost city of Atlantis, a mythical island first mentioned in the works of Plato.\n\nOn further probing, Alt News found that the underwater image was taken off the coast of Mexico. An article published in Daily Mail titled, \u2018Professional mermaid goes tail to tail with giant manta ray five times her size in underwater dance off the coast of Mexico\u2018, contains a video, in which this still can be seen at 1:40 minutes. The article is of 2013. The underwater shoot was focused on manta rays.\n\nIt may be reiterated that these four images are not from the sunken city of Dwarka. Two of the photographs are from Florida, USA whereas one of the images is from Tamil Nadu.", "lang": "en"}
