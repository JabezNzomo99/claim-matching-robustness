I can give the Committee a very comprehensive list. When will the Noble Committee DEMAND the Prizes back, especially since they were gotten under fraud? The reporters and Lamestream Media knew the truth all along. Lawsuits should be brought against all, including the Fake News Organizations, to rectify this terrible injustice. For all of the great lawyers out there, do we have any takers? When will the Noble Committee Act? Better be fast!\n\nAs captured in multiple screenshots like the one seen above, and documented in Pro Publica\u2019s Politiwoops database of deleted tweets, Trump did indeed post these tweets on the afternoon of April 26 and then deleted them about three hours later.\n\nAlthough numerous organizations \u2014 most notably the Pulitzer Prize Board \u2014 bestow awards for excellence in journalism, the Nobel (not \u201cNoble\u201d) Foundation does not. Nobel Prizes are awarded in the areas of physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, peace, and economic sciences.", "lang": "en"}
