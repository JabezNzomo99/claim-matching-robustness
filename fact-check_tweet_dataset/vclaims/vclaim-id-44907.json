No, that's not true: Coupons being shared on social platforms are fake. Starbucks, for one, has apologized and denied the claim.\n\nAn example of the fake coupons is included a post (archived here) on Facebook from June 3, 2020: The fake Starbucks coupon read:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nHere is a screenshot of the Starbucks post, which has been debunked by The Associated Press:\n\nAnd here is a screenshot of a scam KFC promotion, with a QR code that actually reads \"This is a robbery, put the money in the bag.\"\n\nStarbucks denied the claim in an email to the AP, and it also posted on Twitter:\n\nOn June 3, the company did post to Twitter to stand with people of color and do more as a company to help those protesting systemic racism and oppression:\n\nThe posts apparently originated on 4chan, an image-based board where people can post just about anything anonymously. The 4chan thread showing coupons supposedly supporting Black Lives Matter and offering free food or drinks, among other things, has been deleted but is archived here.\n\nThe clearly faked coupons may look real but carry digitally designed QR codes.", "lang": "en"}
