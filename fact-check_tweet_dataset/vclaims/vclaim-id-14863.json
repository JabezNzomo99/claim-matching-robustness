As polls were underway, a picture claiming that Google CEO Sundar Pichai came all the way from the United States to India to cast his vote went viral on social media. In the photo, Pichai can be seen with a few Indians.\n\nThe post has been shared by the Facebook page 'Poor Guy Sayings' and it has already been shared more than 1,200 times. The page has more than nine lakh followers on Facebook.\n\nIndia Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be totally false. When we reverse-searched the photo, we found that the picture was taken when Pichai visited IIT Kharagpur in 2017. Pichai himself tweeted this photo at the time.\n\nBorn in Tamil Nadu's Madurai, Pichai holds American citizenship, and therefore, he is not allowed to cast his vote in Indian elections.\n\nAs per the Election Commission of India (ECI), a person can vote in India if he/she is an Indian citizen. The EC also allows NRIs to cast their votes in India.", "lang": "en"}
