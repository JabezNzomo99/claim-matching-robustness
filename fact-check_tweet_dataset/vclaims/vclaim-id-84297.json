The images are being used in a misleading context; all three are old photos from unrelated protests in 2016.\n\nThe photos have been shared repeatedly on Facebook, for example in this post published on June 5, 2019, and shared dozens of times since.\n\nThe three images show a man in a camouflage vest with a bloody face; people standing in a street throwing rocks, and a damaged vehicle surrounded by soldiers.\n\nTranslated to English, the post's Hindi-language caption says: \u201cStone pelting continues in Srinagar after Eid prayers, should they be shot at first sight?\u201d\n\nSrinagar is a city in Indian-administered Kashmir; here it is on Google Maps. Eid-al-Fitr is a Muslim festival marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan, described here in Encyclopedia Britannica.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe same photos have been shared elsewhere on Facebook with exactly the same or similar claims, for example here and here.\n\nThis Facebook post, dated June 5, 2019, contains the same claim but only shares a single photo \u2013 the one showing the man bleeding from his face.\n\nOn June 5, 2019, clashes did take place in Indian-administered Kashmir during Eid-al-Fitr celebrations, with some people throwing stones, as reported by Indian news agency ANI here and Indian regional newspaper the Deccan Herald here.\n\nThe photos in the misleading Facebook posts do not show this incident; in fact they were all taken in 2016 at unrelated protests.\n\nThe first photo, of the man with the bloody face, appears in this report dated August 25, 2016 on Hindi news website Amarujala, about a clash between workers for India\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and local police in the northern Indian city of Lucknow.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Amarujala report, in which the same image of the bleeding man appears on the right:\n\nThe report\u2019s headline translates to English as: \u201cClash between police and BJP workers in Lucknow.\u201d\n\nLucknow is nearly 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) away from Srinagar, according to this online map.\n\nThe bottom-left image, showing people throwing stones, matches this Reuters photograph taken on January 15, 2016, in Srinagar during a protest after Friday prayers there.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo as it appears on the Reuters image website:\n\nIts caption reads: \u201cA Kashmiri protester throws a stone towards Indian police during a protest in Srinagar, January 15, 2016. The protesters demonstrated after Friday prayers demanding what they said was freedom from Indian rule in Kashmir.\u201d\n\nThe image in the bottom-right of the misleading Facebook post was published in this article dated June 26, 2016 on the website of newspaper the Indian Express about an attack on a vehicle belonging to paramilitary soldiers in Indian-administered Kashmir.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the news report:\n\nIn 2016, Eid-al-Fitr was celebrated on July 6 in Indian administered Kashmir; here is a report on the festival in The Hindu.", "lang": "en"}
