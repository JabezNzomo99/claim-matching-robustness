Attempts to use our neighboring countries as a staging ground to display force will lead to nothing,\u201d Grushko said during the club\u2019s panel discussion on the future of diplomacy.\n\nOther Russian officials have repeatedly voiced similar concerns, pointing to an increased NATO military presence in eastern and central Europe close to Russia\u2019s borders. On December 22, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu pointed to such \u201cincreased threats\u201d from NATO.\n\n\u201cSince 2012, the number of military contingents deployed by NATO near Russia\u2019s western frontiers has increased threefold. Four battalion tactical groups have been deployed in the Baltics and Poland as well as a U.S. Army armored brigade and command staffs of NATO\u2019s multinational divisions in Poland and Romania,\u201d he told Russia\u2019s defense ministry board.\n\nLast August, Grushko, then serving as Russia\u2019s ambassador to NATO, warned that the political situation in Europe was \u201cseriously worsening\u201d amid a \u201cpump-up of arms and armor by the NATO countries on the eastern flank\u201d of Russia on the \u201ccontrived pretense of a Russian threat.\u201d\n\nGrushko\u2019s latest comments come as U.S. President Trump hosts the Baltic Summit at the White House to discuss bi-lateral and regional relations with the presidents of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. The Baltic leaders have expressed concern over Russia\u2019s military actions in Crimea and Ukraine and seek \u201ca very strong political message from the U.S. expressing support for strengthening Baltic security,\u201d said Latvian President Raimons Vejonis on Latvian TV.\n\nPresident Trump, on his part, praised the Baltic states\u2019 defense spending which is around 2% of their gross domestic product, the level set for NATO members.\n\n\u201cWhen nations are committed to peace and to security, they have to pay their share and we will all enjoy a much more safe and prosperous future,\u201d he said at the summit.\n\nExperts say the Baltic leaders nevertheless have legitimate grounds for concern: that it is Russia which crossed a red line in resorting to military force during the war with Georgia in 2008, intervening militarily in eastern Ukraine following the overthrow of President Victor Yanukovich amid popular protests, and illegally annexing Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula in 2014.\n\n\u200bAccording to experts, the increased NATO presence serves to reassure smaller alliance members of NATO\u2019s commitment to their security. It also serves as a deterrent, given the history of Russia\u2019s aggressive actions close to the borders of NATO\u2019s eastern member countries.\n\nThis increased presence, however, pales in comparison to Russia\u2019s massive military build-up on its western flank. For instance, the number of NATO troops in the four multinational groups deployed in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia on a rotational (not permanent) basis stands at just 4,760 servicemen. The overall number of NATO troops there is only 7,200.\u200b\n\nSteven Pifer, an arms control expert at the Washington, D.C.-based Brookings and former ambassador to Ukraine, told Polygraph.info that Grushko's assessment overlooks key facts.\n\n\u201cNATO members introduced ground troops into the Baltic states only after Russia used military force in February-March 2014 to seize Crimea from Ukraine and had built up its military opposite the Baltic states,\u201d he said, noting in a previous comment that the NATO battalions \u201care not going to invade Russia\u201d and that they only \u201cprovide tripwires\u201d in case of a Russian attack.\n\nBut it is not just the troops that concern Russia. Prokhor Tebin, a security expert, argues that NATO\u2019s presence, while not threatening, represents \u201can alarming and vexing factor\u201d given the deployment of U.S. missile defense systems in Romania and Poland. The U.S. says the systems are defensive and not aimed at Russia. Moscow rejects that explanation.\n\nRussia has long accused the West of breaking a promise not to expand NATO to its borders and of sponsoring \u201ccolor revolutions\u201d that removed pro-Russian regimes in Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, and Ukraine in 2003-2005. It also views its actions in Georgia and Ukraine as seeking to ensure regional security and protect its own citizens, minorities, and Russian-speaking communities.\u200b\n\nAccording to Pifer, NATO sought to build to \u201ca positive relationship\u201d with Moscow, in part to allay Russia\u2019s apprehensions about NATO enlargement. \u201cThe Alliance might have shown more creativity in its effort, but Moscow brought little to the table,\u201d he said, speaking of the NATO efforts in the 1990\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s.\n\nAs for the alleged promise not to enlarge NATO, Pifer says the matter remains unsettled.\n\n\u201cIn the context of German reunification, Russia was told that NATO troops would not move into the former DDR. There are lots of debates now about discussions that took place almost 30 years ago, but I do not believe that the Soviet Union was given a promise that NATO would not enlarge,\u201d he said.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Russia\u2019s and NATO\u2019s actions continue to define the shifting security landscape in Europe, one the presidents of the U.S. and the Baltic states appeared to discuss privately at the White House summit.", "lang": "en"}
