Unfortunately, however, he failed to put forward a single new proposal that addresses those risks. We already knew that Senator Sanders wants to break apart financial institutions. What we haven\u2019t seen is his plan to deal with the risky shadow banking activities that brought our economy to the brink of collapse in 2008. By contrast, a wide range of progressive experts has acknowledged that Secretary Clinton\u2019s Wall Street plan is the most serious and comprehensive in this campaign.\u201d\n\u2022 None Barney Frank (D-Mass.), one of the authors of Dodd-Frank: Frank was cited in a Huffington Post article saying that Clinton\u2019s high-frequency trading tax is a \u201cgood idea\u201d and \u201cmakes sense.\u201d Frank Former congressman(D-Mass.), one of the authors of Dodd-Frank: Frank was cited in a Huffington Post article saying that Clinton\u2019s high-frequency trading tax is a \u201cgood idea\u201d and \u201cmakes sense.\u201d Frank advised Clinton on drafting the plan.\n\u2022 None : \u201cSanders FTT [financial transactions tax] would almost certainly do more to change behavior on Wall Street than everything that Clinton has proposed taken together, by a rather large margin.

Leaving out the FTT in this comparison is sort of like evaluating the New England Patriots\u2019 Super Bowl prospects without discussing their quarterback.\u201d\n\u2022 None James Galbraith, Robert Reich, \n\n In our view, Senator Sanders\u2019 plan for comprehensive financial reform is critical for avoiding another \u201ctoo-big-to-fail\u201d financial crisis. The Senator is correct that the biggest banks must be broken up and that a new 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act, separating investment from commercial banking, must be enacted. Wall Street\u2019s largest banks are now far bigger than they were before the crisis, and they still have every incentive to take excessive risks. No major Wall Street executive has been indicted for the fraudulent behavior that led up to the 2008 crash, and fines imposed on the banks have been only a fraction of the banks\u2019 potential gains. In addition, the banks and their lobbyists have succeeded in watering down the Dodd-Frank reform legislation, and the financial institutions that pose the greatest risk to our economy have still not devised sufficient \u201cliving wills\u201d for winding down their operations in the event of another crisis. Secretary Hillary Clinton\u2019s more modest proposals do not go far enough. They call for a bit more oversight and a few new charges on shadow banking activity, but they leave intact the titanic financial conglomerates that practice most shadow banking. As a result, her plan does not adequately reduce the serious risks our financial system poses to the American economy and to individual Americans. Given the size and political power of Wall Street, her proposals would only invite more dilution and finagle. The only way to contain Wall Street\u2019s excesses is with reforms sufficiently bold and public they can\u2019t be watered down. That\u2019s why we support Senator Sanders\u2019s plans for busting up the biggest banks and resurrecting a modernized version of Glass-Steagall. [Update: The letter is now signed by 170 academics.] The Sanders campaign released a letter signed by 60 academics in economics and beyond, in support of Sanders\u2019s plan over Clinton\u2019s. The letter was signed by Baker,, Robert Reich, Robert Hockett of Cornell University and 56 others. It reads:\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Clinton formally released her Wall Street plan nearly three months before Sanders released his full Wall Street plan, and the majority of the references sent from both campaigns are from October 2015, when Clinton released her plan. So by the nature of timing, Clinton had a more comprehensive and detailed plan until Sanders\u2019s was released. But a Clinton campaign spokesman said: \u201cHer plan being tougher, more effective and more comprehensive isn\u2019t about timing, it\u2019s about the substance.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
