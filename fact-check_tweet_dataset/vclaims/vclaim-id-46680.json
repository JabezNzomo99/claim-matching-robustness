The universally accepted definition of \u201chypersonic\u201d is anything traveling at Mach 5 (five times of a speed of sound) or faster. According to Putin, Russia\u2019s hypersonic missiles can fly \u201c27 times faster than the speed of sound.\u201d\n\nIf speed were the only factor in determining whether a weapon should be labelled hypersonic, then the U.S. LGM-30 Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile, which reaches a speed of Mach 23, would qualify. The first version of the Minuteman system was deployed in the early 1960s, and the nuclear-tipped missile has been regularly modernized.\n\nWhile not described as \u201chypersonic,\u201d the speed of the LGM-30 Minuteman III nearly matches that of Russia\u2019s Kinzhal, Avangard and Tsircon hypersonic delivery systems.\n\nIf the U.S. had a hypersonic intercontinental ballistic missile well before Russia, why is Putin claiming that only Russia has such weapons?\n\n\u201cThe LGM-30 Minuteman III is the launcher vehicle for the weapon, in this case the RV (re-entry vehicle, carrying the nuclear warheads). It [the Minuteman] does in fact fly at hypersonic speeds but it\u2019s a different class of weapon system,\u201d George Nacouzi, a senior engineer with the at the RAND Corporation\u2019s Project Air Force, told Polygraph.info.\n\nThat raises a second question: what types of hypersonic weapons are known to be under development? There are two -- hypersonic cruise missiles, which can fly at altitudes up to 100,000 feet, and hypersonic glide vehicles, which can fly above 100,000 feet. A glide vehicle is placed atop a rocket, from which it is launched and then glides on top of the atmosphere.\n\n\u201cThe hypersonic weapons being discussed by Putin and others are Hypersonic Glide Vehicles (HGV) and some are hypersonic cruise missiles (HCM). Unlike an RV, which flies ballistically (like a baseball flying through the air), an HGV flies more like a glider on top of the atmosphere. It\u2019s a completely different trajectory and the HGV is maneuverable so it\u2019s much more difficult to defend against,\u201d Nacouzi explained.\n\nNacouzi noted that China may have an \u201coperational\u201d hypersonic missile with a range of 1,800-2,500 kilometers, which is classified a medium range missile, compared to the intercontinental (5,500 km) missile Putin claimed Russia has developed.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what its status is,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, given that they displayed several of them, the message they seem to be sending is that they do have an operational hypersonic missile. Open sources indicate that the DF-17 has a range between 1800-2500 km.\u201d\n\nWhile Russia and China are the first nations to have announced the operational deployment of hypersonic weapons systems, other nations have had hypersonic programs for decades, and some of those have successfully tested these weapons as early as in 2011.\n\nThe Congressional Research Service (CRS) reported in September 2019 that at least seven countries have been developing hypersonic weapons technology for over a decade. These include the United States, Russia, China, Australia, India, France and Germany.\n\nTitled \u201cHypersonic Weapons: Background and Issues for Congress\u201d the CRS report detailed open source information about the U.S. and other nation\u2019s programs to develop these weapons.\n\n\u201cSome of the systems described in the report are similar to the ones Putin is referring to,\u201d Nacouzi said. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s not clear how far along the US intercontinental range hypersonic weapon is. So the types of weapons are the same, i.e., hypersonic glide vehicles, but Putin claims that Russia has an intercontinental range class and it\u2019s not clear what the status of the US version is.\u201d\n\nMuch depends on whether the nations developing this class of weapons arm them with nuclear warheads. As described in \u201cGlobal Hypersonic Missiles Market 2017-2021,\u201d a report conducted by the Ireland-based Research and Markets group, arming such missiles with nuclear warheads could have a devastating effect.\n\n\u201cHypersonic missiles, when fitted with nuclear warheads, can be fatal to the target enemy country,\u201d the report stated. \u201cIt can also cause nuclear winter that could last for a very long time after the initial attack and eventually leave the area inhabitable.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Sept. 2019 CRS report and other open source data, the U.S. has invested in research and development for a hypersonic missile called the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon (AHW), which uses boost glide technology to propel warheads with conventional, rather than nuclear payloads.\n\nNacouzi said, this program presents the U.S. with additional challenges.\n\n\u201dThe US intercontinental version is more challenging since it will need to have much higher accuracy due to its conventional system, as opposed to the Russian system, which has a nuclear payload so [it] doesn\u2019t need the same level of accuracy,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2011, the U.S. successfully tested an AHW to try and determine its capabilities for atmospheric flight over long ranges.\n\nThe U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2019s (DAPRA) Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 (HTV-2) achieved a speed of Mach 20 in August 2011.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force successfully tested a hypersonic AGM-183A Air Launched Rapid Response Weapon, or ARRW, in June 2019.\n\n\u201cPutin may be right in saying that no one has a hypersonic glide vehicle of intercontinental range, but [it is] not true that no one has a hypersonic weapon,\u201d Nacouzi said.", "lang": "en"}
