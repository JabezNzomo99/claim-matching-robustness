You should not click or interact with them.\n\nThis sort of scam is called a phishing scam, which is where people pretend to be trustworthy companies or organisations in order to get personal information from victims.\n\nIn this case, people have received text messages, supposedly from the government, asking them to follow a link to receive a \u201cgoodwill payment\u201d of \u00a3258 in light of the ongoing outbreak of the new coronavirus.\n\nBoth links mentioned in the Facebook posts have been flagged by Google as deceptive when you try to visit them, and only one site was active at the time of writing this piece.\n\nThe site mimics the government\u2019s official website, and asks people to put in their postcode, personal information, and then bank and card details.\n\nDo not supply this information online unless you are sure who you are sending it to, and it is through a safe method.\n\nActionFraud, the UK\u2019s national reporting centre for fraud and cybercrime, says \u201cnever respond to unsolicited messages and calls that ask for your personal or financial details.\u201d Action Fraud has more tips on how to spot scam messages and emails here.\n\nThere are a few things which reveal this is a scam\n\nThe website url is \u201cuk-covid-relieve.com.\u201d The government\u2019s website has a \u201cgov.uk\u201d URL, not a \u201c.com\u201d url.\n\nAlso the phrase \u2018Covid relief\u2019 is misspelt \u201cCovid relieve\u201d. Clicking on other links around the page does not lead to new pages, and the original text message appears to come from senders called \u201cCoronavirus\u201d or \u201cCOVID19\u201d rather than the government.\n\nAlso, the government has made no announcement regarding any one-off payments to the whole UK population following the Covid-19 outbreak. There are some schemes now active for the self-employed, businesses and homeowners, but none that would affect the entire population.", "lang": "en"}
