An article published by American Web Media in March 2018, for example, provided the following backstory for this viral photograph:\n\nWhen The Principal Explained Why He Had The Floor Painted Like This, It All Made Perfect Sense Optical illusions can be a lot of fun when they\u2019re put into quizzes and challenges. But what if they\u2019re used in daily life to influence the way people interact with their environment? That\u2019s what one interior designer asked when they were trying to figure out a way to encourage students not to run down the hallway. Signs telling them to slow down were not working. They needed something more creative. That\u2019s when they decided to paint the tiles on the floor in a special way that created the optical illusion of a massive dip in the hall.\n\nThis is a genuine photograph of an optical illusion on the floor of small hallway, but the \u201cdiscouraging students from running\u201d backstory is pure fiction.\n\nThis hallway was designed by Casa Ceramica, a tile company in the United Kingdom, and is located at the entrance of their showroom (not a school). The design, partly inspired by Alice in Wonderland, took more than 400 tiles to create. Although the hallway may look severely uneven, its floor is actually a perfectly flat surface.\n\nCasa Ceramica posted an explanatory article about this image to their web site in September 2017 when the picture of their unusual hallway first started making its way around the internet:\n\nLast week we went viral online with our entrance floor! With various headlines of \u2018Wonky floor\u2019 to \u2018This floor was installed to stop people running\u201d, which isn\u2019t the case! During the creation of our new showroom we knew we needed to have an entrance that would make our customers really remember their visit to and something that showcased what can be achieved with tiles. Pushing all the boundaries. Although to the naked eye the floor does look at little uneven it isn\u2019t until you view it through a camera that the true illusion is brought to life. Customers are amazed when they enter, it\u2019s one of the first things out of their mouths and then are even more amazed when we show them what happens when viewed through a camera.\n\nCasa Ceramica has also addressed the hallway rumors on social media:", "lang": "en"}
