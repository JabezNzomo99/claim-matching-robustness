These liabilities are primarily in the form of loans. [2]\n\nThe OECD has no convention for defining \u201cdeveloped\u201d countries, however it states that \"Japan in Asia, Canada and the United States in northern America, Australia and New Zealand in Oceania and Europe are considered \u2018developed\u2019 regions or areas\u201d. [3]\n\nMr Bowen's office told AAP FactCheck the source of his claim was taken from Bank of International Settlements data. The BIS is a Swiss-based umbrella group for the world's central banks. [4]\n\nThe shadow treasurer based his claim on a BIS table for the third quarter of 2018, which measures household debt as a percentage of GDP across the 34 OECD nations.\n\nAAP FactCheck examined a graph on household debt as a percentage of GDP in an Institute of International Finance table which also placed Australia second in the world behind Switzerland.\n\nBoth the Bank of International Settlements data and Institute of International Finance table support Mr Bowen\u2019s claim. [5]\n\nAAP FactCheck looked at graphs by the OECD National Accounts Statistics and Reserve Bank of Australia measuring household debt using the ratio of debt-to-income.\n\nBoth graphs placed Australia fourth in the world. Australia was behind Denmark (first), the Netherlands (second) and Norway in the OECD table, and in the RBA graph behind the Netherlands (first), Denmark (second) and Switzerland. [6][7]\n\nAAP FactCheck concludes that using the measure of household debt as a percentage of GDP, Mr Bowen\u2019s claim is correct, while noting that other measurements give a different outcome.", "lang": "en"}
