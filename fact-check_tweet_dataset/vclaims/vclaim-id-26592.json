Ribble Valley\u2019s average score of 8.30 was the highest of any local authority in the UK, for the year to March 2019.\n\nA number of reasons have been suggested for why Ribble Valley reached the top spot\u2014from its quiet lanes and transport links, to its burgeoning gastronomic reputation.\n\nBut there\u2019s one other less-discussed possibility\u2014uncertainties with the data.\n\nThe ONS says that ranking local authorities according to their average scores \u201cmay be misleading for various reasons\u201d.\n\nThe main one is that because the number of people surveyed is quite small in some areas, the ONS isn\u2019t entirely confident that the happiness level calculated completely reflects the actual happiness level of people in those areas. So, for each local authority, the ONS provides a lower and upper confidence interval\u2014which express what range the happiness level could fall within.\n\nSo, for example, while the average score in Ribble Valley was 8.30, it had one of the lowest sample sizes\u201460 people\u2014and the ONS thinks its true happiness score could be anywhere between 7.90 and 8.69.\n\nThat\u2019s quite a wide margin of error, so if Ribble Valley\u2019s happiness score was actually closer to the lower estimate of 7.90 then its ranking might change dramatically. 182 other local authorities have an upper confidence interval which is above 7.90. So almost half of all the UK\u2019s local authorities could actually be happier than Ribble Valley.\n\nIn 2015/16 the area ranked 362 out of 389 local authorities on the measure. The volatility of the score over time perhaps further illustrates the wide margin of error associated with small sample sizes, rather than any genuine dramatic improvement in fortunes for the locals. Or perhaps it has genuinely been a brilliant few years for the denizens of Ribble Valley.", "lang": "en"}
