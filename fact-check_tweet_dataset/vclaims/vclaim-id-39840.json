The post also claims that the alpha-numeric code on one of the vertical stays of the cylinder is the expiry date. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claims made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: LPG cylinder\u2019s expiry date can be seen as an alpha-numeric code on the cylinder. Fact: IOCL has issued a clarification that \u2018there is no expiry date for LPG cylinders\u2019. The alpha-numeric code on the cylinder is the test due date. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nWhen searched on Google with the keywords \u2018LPG Cylinder Expiry Date\u2019, it was found that IOCL (Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.) has already issued a clarification regarding this issue. In a statement, IOCL has clarified that \u2018there is no expiry date for LPG cylinders, only test due date\u2019. \n\n\n\nWhile explaining the alpha-numeric code on the cylinder, IOCL has said that \u201cthe markings indicate the next due date of testing. E.g. cylinders marked A 2017 means that they are due for testing in the first quarter (between January and March) of the year 2017. Similarly, B 2017 indicates cylinders that are due for testing in the second quarter (between April and June) of the year 2017 and so on. Similarly, C (between July and September) is for the third quarter and D (between October and December) for the fourth quarter.\u201d\n\nIn the same statement from IOCL, it can be seen that \u201ccylinders due for statutory testing do not go to the market. Moreover, all LPG distributors are under instructions to check the same before delivering cylinders to the customers.\u201d Talking to \u2018The Hindu\u2019, an oil industry person has said that \u2018if a consumer receives a cylinder which is due for the test, then the consumer can ask the delivery boy to take it back and give another since it means that the mandatory test has not been conducted. But this is a rarity.\u2019 Also, \u201cno LPG accidents are ever reported due to expiry of test date or cylinders due for statutory testing\u201d, said IOCL in the statement. \n\n\n\nTo sum it up, IOCL has clarified that \u201cthere is no expiry date for LPG cylinders, only test due date\u201d.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
