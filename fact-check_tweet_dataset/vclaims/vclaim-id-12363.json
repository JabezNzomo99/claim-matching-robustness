No, the popular long-running late night show has not been cancelled -- despite tweets from President Trump that the show is unfunny and unfair. A report published by a website that bills itself as \"America's Last Line of Defense\" is a work of satire, although that distinction may escape many readers who share it on social media.\n\nThe future of SNL is a question after President Trump recently tweeted that the network should face \"retribution\" for the \"hit jobs\" delivered by the show.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on February 24, 2019 titled \"Fake News NBC Finally Pulls The Plug - Saturday Night Live Canceled\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nAfter pressure from the White House, the FCC, and millions of angry fans demanding they stop disrespecting our President to no avail, NBC has finally shut down the lame show Saturday Night Live. Fist, they canceled last nights live performance in favor of a re-run that barely talked about politics. Then, afterward, Lorne Michaels made the announcement that NBC had ended production and that his show was dead in the water: \"I think I blame myself, mostly. When Trump was elected we should have known that the giant man-baby would stomp his feet until the adults stopped making fun of him. He's a turd and a gift to satire and parody. unfortunately, he's also a child stuck in a man's body.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe site comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including wearethellod.com, bustatroll.org or bebest.website. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nBlair and his operation were profiled by the Washington Post on November 17, 2018 by Eli Saslow:\n\n'Nothing on this page is real': How lies become truth in online America November 17 The only light in the house came from the glow of three computer monitors, and Christopher Blair, 46, sat down at a keyboard and started to type. His wife had left for work and his children were on their way to school, but waiting online was his other community, an unreality where nothing was exactly as it seemed.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes bustatroll.org as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
