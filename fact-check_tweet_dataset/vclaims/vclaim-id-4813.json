See how the Madhya Pradesh BJP government gave an introduction of their cruelty to the innocent farmers. The farmers were conveying their justified demands to this cruel government. Instead of fulfilling their demands this government gave them death. -translated) A video with the above text has been shared by a Facebook account. It may be recalled that in June 2017, a farmers\u2019 agitation in Mandsaur, MP had resulted in police firing. Six people had died in the violence.\n\nAs seen in the video, policemen are in a kneeling position with their guns pointed at a crowd which can be heard shouting some slogans. Some gunshots are fired at the horde and the assembly scatters, when the two men are apparently shot down. Policemen can be seen running with a stretcher to the spot. After a while, the police company starts marching in the direction in which people had escaped. Sometime later, an ambulance starts moving in the same direction with an announcement in the background.\n\nQuestions which arise from the video :\n\nIf you see the video, there are two stark observations which suggest that the video is a mock drill and not an actual police shooting:\n\u2022 There are bystanders on both sides of the road who remain calm and still watching the police apparently shooting the two men. It is generally observed that in a situation of conflict, the crowd goes in a state of panic and people start dispersing when shots are fired.\n\u2022 A public announcement saying, \u201c\u090f\u0915 \u092c\u093e\u0930 \u092a\u0941\u0928\u0903 \u092e\u0948\u0902 \u0926\u0930\u094d\u0936\u0915\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u092c\u0924\u093e \u0926\u0942\u0901. \u092f\u0939 \u0915\u0947\u0935\u0932 \u090f\u0915 \u0921\u0947\u092e\u094b \u0925\u093e. \u091c\u093f\u0938\u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0916\u0942\u0902\u091f\u0940 \u092a\u0941\u0932\u093f\u0938 \u0928\u0947 \u0905\u092a\u0928\u0940 \u0938\u0915\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u0924\u093e \u0926\u093f\u0916\u093e\u0908 \u0915\u093f \u0915\u093f\u0938\u0940 \u092d\u0940 \u0935\u093f\u0937\u092e \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0925\u093f \u0938\u0947 \u0928\u093f\u092a\u091f\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u0939\u092e\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u092a\u0941\u0932\u093f\u0938 \u0939\u092e\u0947\u0936\u093e \u0924\u0924\u094d\u092a\u0930 \u0914\u0930 \u0924\u0948\u092f\u093e\u0930 \u0939\u0948\u0902. \u201c(One more time, I inform the audience this is only a demo. In which Khunti police has displayed its agility and readiness to deal with any odd situation -translated.)\n\nMultiple pages on Facebook have shared the video with the text claiming farmers are being shot by the Mandsaur police.\n\nMoreover, Alt News found the same video captioned \u201cHuman rights in India. To shed light on the UNHRC report that was being shrugged by the GOI.\u201d shared on a Facebook page, India Resists: updates and perspectives on people\u2019s movements.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nAlt News did a Google reverse image search of the keyframes using Invid verification plugin. As it turned out, a YouTube video published on Nov 1, 2017, titled \u201cMoke Dreal of Khunti Police\u201d was found. The title calls it a mock drill carried out by Khunti Police.\n\nMoreover, many name boards in the shops are visible in the video. Alt News Google searched the shop name, \u201cJagdamba steel Khunti\u201d and found that the two match.\n\nIn a conversation with Alt News, the owner of Jagdamba Steel has confirmed that a mock drill was carried out by the police on October 31, 2017. It may be reiterated that an announcement in the background was enough to raise suspicion and contradiction to the claims made with the video.\n\nFurthermore, we found one more video of the same mock drill filmed from a different angle and time-frame. In the video, policemen on the standby position can be seen near a stage setup and importantly, the crowd stays well organized on the edges of the road throughout the mock drill.\n\u2022 The police parties come in succession one after another, no struggle amongst the engaging groups(0:40 to 1:27)\n\u2022 No traces of blood on the body of the two men which fall down after the gunshots (1:51)\n\u2022 A part of the announcement, \u201c\u090f\u0915 \u092c\u093e\u0930 \u092a\u0941\u0928\u0903 \u092e\u0948\u0902 \u0926\u0930\u094d\u0936\u0915\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u092c\u0924\u093e \u0926\u0942\u0901.\u201d (2:32) makes it even more evident that it was a mock drill and not an actual police firing video\n\nThis post follows the same pattern of captioning a video with an unrelated narrative which gets shared by multiple users on different platforms. All such videos which turn out to be patently false are mostly found lacking in basic information or context. While police firing had indeed take place at the farmers\u2019 agitation in Mandsaur last year, a closer look at this particular video would have revealed that the events depicted in it are not an actual incident of firing but only a simulation, as there were enough cues in it to suggest the same.", "lang": "en"}
