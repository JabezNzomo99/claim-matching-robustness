However, in principle the figures are reasonable.\u201d\n\nof the Davis Committee, suggested we consider revenue estimates in Treasury\u2019s\n\nThese figures are \u201cfar more user-friendly,\u201d Lester noted, as they consider\n\ntaxpayers and not just assessed taxpayers as is the case with the annual tax statistics report.\n\nThe most recent budget review is for\n\nand shows that just over 1.9 million registered taxpayers are estimated to contribute just over 80% of income tax.\n\n, just over 1.7 million taxpayers were estimated to have contributed 78% of taxes, closer to Roets\u2019 claim.\n\nWhile these figures are estimates of expected tax revenue, Lester noted the process of collecting tax returns for assessment can be lengthy.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s better to work with the estimates and what they ultimately expect to receive, as per [national treasury] numbers\u201d Lester added.\n\nIngrid Woolard, dean of the commerce faculty at the University of Cape Town and fellow member of the Davis committee, added that SARS\u2019 assessed tax data \u201cdoesn\u2019t actually tell us anything about the number of people that pay tax nor about the number earning more than R350,000 [annually]\u201d.\n\nChristopher Axelson, \u200ea director at national treasury in the personal income taxes and saving division, told Africa Check that while both datasets could be used to check a claim like this, each comes with its own set of limitations and drawbacks.\n\nBudget review data \u201cshows a more complete view of the taxable income distribution, but is only an estimate and actual changes in the distribution may have been different in practice,\u201d Axelson told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cThe SARS data illustrates final tax collections, but only indicates this for individuals who filed an assessment,\u201d Axelson said and added it is therefore \u201can incomplete view of the distribution\u201d.\n\nConclusion: The claim is mostly correct\n\nTo provide an accurate fact-check, it is essential to know the source and timeframe considered. Without these, the fact-checking process is made more difficult\n\nSARS and treasury officials, together with consulted experts, directed Africa Check to annual tax statistics and budget review data as the best tax-related information. But both data sources have limitations.\n\nWhile the latest tax statistics fall close to Roets\u2019s claim (namely, 1.8 million individuals contributed 89% of income tax), these figures aren\u2019t inclusive of all taxpayers.\n\nTreasury budget review data for 2016/2017 is in the same ballpark (1.7 million taxpayers contribute 78% of income tax) and takes into account all taxpayers, but these figures are estimates. The latest treasury estimates show 1.9 million individuals are expected to contribute an estimated 80% of income tax.\n\nGiven that the claim requires clarification, we rate it mostly correct.\n\nLatest estimate puts it at 1.9 million peopleThere were 1,821,394 individual taxpayers who earned more than R250,001 per year. These individuals collectively contributed R239.2 billion (89%) of assessed income tax that year.Edited by Kate Wilkinson", "lang": "en"}
