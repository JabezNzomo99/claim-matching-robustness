And I am sure, this wasn\u2019t the first delivery. Thanks to Aleksa Del Rioz for this personal documentation that she shared yesterday. GOD IS GOOD!!!\u201d\n\nThe claim was sent to Rappler\u2019s email for fact checking. Since its posting, it has been shared for almost 2,000 times with 612 reactions and 41 comments, as of writing.\n\nThe facts: Not all of the photos in Samonte's Facebook album were taken after the quakes in Cotabato, and not all can be attributed to Del Rioz's \"personal documentation.\"\n\nTwo photos were originally taken in 2015 by a Rappler photographer for a typhoon relief operation in Aurora province. Meanwhile, 4 photos were indeed taken after the Mindanao earthquakes in October 2019, but were provided by DSWD Region XII information officers Hilbert Estacion and Ronald Daria.

On November 1, radyo.inquirer.net said the military aircraft carried emergency supplies, including sleeping kits, laminated sacks, and tents for those displaced by the earthquake.\n\nRappler also asked the DSWD Region XII office through Facebook Messenger whether Del Rioz was affiliated with them or was part of the relief operations team for Mindanao. Their office said they did not know Del Rioz.\n\nBased on his Facebook profile, Dax Samonte is a supporter of the administration who regularly posts criticisms against the opposition. In 2018, one of his posts was fact-checked as it shared a wrong photo of Panguil Bay Bridge.\n\nMany misleading photos had been fact-checked before in relation to disaster relief operations of the government. In September 2018, for instance, a post showing an image of boxes of relief goods from DSWD was mistaken for Typhoon Ompong relief efforts. But the photo was also originally captured in 2015 during a post-Typhoon Lando relief operation.", "lang": "en"}
