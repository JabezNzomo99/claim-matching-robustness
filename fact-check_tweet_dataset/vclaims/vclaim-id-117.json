For those who have not yet filed their return for 2019, the IRS will use information from their 2018 tax filing to calculate the payment. The economic impact payment will be deposited directly into the same banking account reflected on the return filed.\u201d\n\nThe IRS advises people visit its site www.irs.gov/coronavirus for updates \u201crather than calling IRS assistors who are helping process 2019 returns.\u201d\n\nAmericans should start receiving direct payments from the U.S. government in mid-April ( here ).\n\nFalse: You cannot track the status of your stimulus check by calling 1-800-746-6373, this post is an April fool\u2019s joke\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
