This is a topic we\u2019ve written about before. As we said then, 200,000 was the government\u2019s own estimate of how many more people would find jobs by 2024/25, as a result of Universal Credit.\n\nThe prime minister has conflated a prediction that the government made 19 months ago with evidence that they have actually achieved it.\n\nIn response to a letter from the shadow work and pensions secretary, Margaret Greenwood MP, the chair of the UK Statistics Authority, Sir David Norgrove, wrote to confirm that \u201cthe 200,000 figure represents the Department for Work and Pensions\u2019 estimate of the predicted impact on employment once Universal Credit is fully rolled out rather than the effect so far.\u201d\n\nThe figure originally appeared in a document released by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in June 2018, which argued the business case for the introduction of Universal Credit.\n\nThe National Audit Office expressed \u201csignificant doubt about the main benefits\u201d that the DWP expected. It also said that the DWP would not be able to measure the effect of Universal Credit, because it could not filter out other effects on employment from the wider economy.", "lang": "en"}
