The fight to retake the city of Marawi, which left it looking like Swiss cheese, was triggered by an attempt to serve a warrant of arrest for drug trafficking on the leader of an Islamic jihad.\"\n\nThe facts: The Maute group's involvement in drug trafficking was never mentioned in early statements made by defense and military leaders in explaining why they conducted the operations that triggered the escalation of hostilities in the city.\n\nThe Philippine military had been engaged in clashes with the Abu Sayyaf Group and the Maute Group for months before the Marawi war broke.

Its leader, Isnilon Hapilon, based in Basilan in the western part of Mindanao, reportedly brought some of his men to Lanao del Sur in late 2016 to join the Maute Group.

In her commentary entitled, \"In the name of drugs again,\" Ellen Tordesillas of Vera Files noted that the President mentioned this in a speech he made before businessmen on October 19, 2017.\n\nDuterte caused dismay among Moro leaders and security experts when he reiterated this again during his 2019 State of the Nation Address. In reference to the siege, he said \"drug money killed 175 and wounded [2,101] of my soldiers and policemen in that 5-month battle.\u201d\n\nIn that speech, Duterte made no further mention in his SONA of plans to rehabilitate the war-torn city, or of programs to curb terrorism. This is despite the recent emergence of suicide attacks in parts of Mindanao and the threat it presents to the rest of the country. \u2013 Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
