It also failed to mention that Marcus retired from his position in 2002 and that political action committees associated with both Lowe's and Home Depot have contributed money to both major political parties, but more toward Republicans, in the 2020 federal election cycle.\n\nThe CEO of Lowe's announced that the company is offering $25 million in grant money for minority-owned businesses trying to reopen amid the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. Also, Bernie Marcus, the co-founder of Home Depot, gave millions to Trump's 2016 campaign.\n\nIn early June 2020, a meme comparing two popular U.S. home improvement chains spread across social media:\n\nThe facts presented are true, but some context was missing.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Lowe\u2019s has created a $25 million grant for minority-owned small businesses trying to reopen after being forced to close due to the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. As CNBC reported on May 20, 2020:\n\nLowe\u2019s is dishing out the funds to help small businesses, especially home improvement professionals, in need of masks, personal protective equipment and other supplies to operate safely. The new funds follow $340 million of support the home improvement retailer provided for Covid-19 response activities in the first quarter. \u201cThese are going to be minority businesses and other businesses that are now starting to reopen,\u201d CEO Marvin Ellison told CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer in a \u201cMad Money\u201d interview. \u201cSo we just want to continue to not only run a good business but also be a great corporate citizen in all of the communities that we operate in.\u201d\n\nIt is also true that Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus donated $7 million to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. He vowed to again support Trump in his 2020 run against presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden.\n\nMarcus, a philanthropist who gives billions of dollars away to various causes, is generally a large-ticket financial supporter of Republican politicians and organizations. But he also retired from his position as Home Depot\u2019s company chairman in 2002. (Home Depot\u2019s other co-founder, Arthur Blank, who is also retired from the company, appears to donate primarily to Democrats.)\n\nThe Home Depot political action committee on the other hand has contributed a total of $1,495,000 to both Democratic and Republican federal candidates in 2020, with 44% of those contributions going to Democrats and 56% to Republicans, according to the campaign transparency tracking tool Open Secrets.\n\nMeantime the political action committee for Lowe\u2019s donated a total of $540,500 to federal candidates in both parties, with 30% going to Democrats and 70% to Republicans, per Open Secrets.\n\nPolitical action committees (PACs) associated with corporations are separate organizations that are funded by employees or owners of the company (but not the company itself). These PACs donate money to political candidates and organizations they believe to be \u201caligned with their financial goals,\u201d explains Open Secrets.\n\nGiven the meme leaves out important context about political contributions and Marcus\u2019 current involvement with Home Depot, we rate this claim \u201cMostly true.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
