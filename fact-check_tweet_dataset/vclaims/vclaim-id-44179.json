Posted by Richard \"GOMA\" Gomez on Thursday, May 28, 2020\n\n\n\nIn the post, Gomez responded to statements Duterte\u2019s chief legal counsel Salvador Panelo made on his program \"Counterpoint\u201d and to Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Eduardo A\u00f1o\u2019s comments on the matter. \n\n\n\nA\u00f1o, who is in charge of the local government units, said on May 26: \"I'm warning you to stop that. You can't say, 'We have zero COVID-19 cases so we won't take in OFWs, or they should stay at the pier.' That won't do. I myself will go after you.\u201d\n\n\n\nGomez reiterated all he asked for was coordination. \u201c'Wag niyo po masamain 'pag humihingi kami ng coordination sa inyo (Don\u2019t take it negatively if we ask for coordination from you),\u201d Gomez said. \n\n\n\nPanelo said on Wednesday, May 27, in Filipino: \u201cRichard, I listened to you, and you said you\u2019re more than ready. You have 200-300, may 200-300 beds, you have quarantine centers. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t have a COVID case, because you\u2019re prepared. So, I\u2019m confused why you would be flustered suddenly if you were only notified within the hour, or within 24 hours that you have new residents arriving. You\u2019re ready, right?\"\n\n\n\nGomez replied on Facebook in a mix of Filipino and English: \"I wasn\u2019t 'flustered' like you said. We followed the earlier memo of the DILG briefing they gave the LGUs last Thursday, May 21, that 3 days prior to the arrival of repatriates there should be coordination from their LGU of origin and notice from the national agencies so they can prepare properly.\" \n\n\n\nHe added: \"What happened, a few hours later, I received a text from Manila that they [the repatriates] were already in Palo, Leyte, and they were looking for a ride for those who are part of the 'Balik Probinsya.'\"\n\n\n\nThe Ormoc City mayor said he only \"asked for coordination.\" None of the posts, nor public statements made by Gomez so far, said that he would not receive any of the returning residents. \n\n\n\n\u201cWe ask for coordination not to give anyone a hard time, but to make the process smooth for everyone,\u201d he said.", "lang": "en"}
