In a tweet, the president denounced the publication as a \u201cfar-left magazine.\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 20, the conservative Christian website Pulpit and Pen, which is part of the Baptist, Montana-based Polemics Ministry United, published an article with the headline \u201cRemember That \u2018Christianity Today\u2019 Is Backed by George Soros.\u201d The article reported that:\n\nChristianity Today called for the U.S. Senate to affirm the impeachment of the U.S. House against President Donald J. Trump. As you soak that in, we\u2019ll remind you that it\u2019s already been reported by this publication (and others) that Christianity Today is a Soros front organization. [Blogger Ed] Stetzer and Christianity Today posted an article promoting George Soros\u2019 immigration plan on November 7. In it, they said that \u201cevangelicals should help lead\u201d Soros\u2019 immigration plan. That immigration plan was planned and promoted by the Evangelical Immigration Table, which is a Soros front organization of the National Immigration Forum and is ultimately traced directly back to Soros\u2019 Open Societies Foundation. That Soros owns the Evangelical Immigration Table (EIT) is so well-known, it\u2019s not worth answering any ill-informed dispute of the knowledge. Well-known Christian leader, Eric Metaxas, got off the board and repudiated it when he found out that it was a Soros operation. Christianity Today is in \u201ccahoots\u201d with Soros in a verifiably documented way. It should come as no surprise they\u2019re calling for Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\nOn Dec. 22, the right-leaning website DC Dirty Laundry published a tweaked version of Pulpit and Pen\u2019s article, and claimed that Christianity Today was \u201cfunded by George Soros,\u201d writing:\n\n\u201cChristianity Today has now strongly endorsed the impeachment of President Trump and it\u2019s time to expose them as the false teachers they are \u2026 Do you realize that Christianity Today is partially funded by George Soros?\u201d\n\nSoros has long been the subject of a seemingly endless series of fevered, baseless conspiracy theories, often inspired or aligned with anti-semitic tropes, which portray him as a shadowy, sinister, and unaccountable figure who exerts disproportionate control over global affairs. His status as a hate figure among many right-leaning observers and consumers of baseless conspiracy theories means that merely associating a given person or group with Soros has become a method of choice for discrediting an opponent or rhetorical target.\n\nSo it was in the case of Christianity Today and its detractors in December 2019. Neither the publication nor its parent organization, the non-profit Christianity Today International, have received funding or institutional backing from Soros; claims to the contrary were based on a ludicrous distortion of extremely tenuous \u201cconnections\u201d \u2014 an example of the kind of \u201cjoining the dots\u201d that fuels many ultimately baseless conspiracy theories.\n\nIn response to our requests for comment, Tim Dalrymple, president and CEO of Christianity Today International, told Snopes that:\n\n\u201cChristianity Today covers 85 percent of its annual budget through earned revenue: mostly subscriptions, advertising, and product sales. Only 15 percent of our budget comes through gifts and grants. We have never received a donation from George Soros or the Open Society Foundation. Of the foundations who have given us support, we cannot find any connection to Soros or any of his funding entities.\u201d\n\nWe examined the organization\u2019s three most recent tax returns, from 2018, 2017, and 2016. None of those forms, nor any of the accompanying documents, contained any reference or information indicating any association between Christianity Today International or its subsidiary publication Christianity Today, and Soros or any of his associated philanthropic organizations.\n\nThe claim that Christianity Today is \u201cbacked\u201d or funded by Soros, or that it is a \u201cSoros front organization,\u201d is simply false.\n\nThe link drawn by Pulpit and Pen consisted of the following, relatively convoluted connections:\n\nIn November, the Evangelical Immigration Table, an initiative by Evangelical pastors that promotes and emphasizes the dignity and humanity of displaced migrants, launched a campaign called the Evangelical Call for Restitution-Based Immigration Reform. One of those who supported the campaign was Ed Stetzer, a pastor and Christianity Today columnist, who wrote in a tweet that the campaign \u201cpoints to a way forward on immigration that\u2019s guided by biblical principles.\u201d\n\nOn Nov. 9, Christianity Today published a column by Matthew Soerens, national coordinator of the Evangelical Immigration Table, in which he explained and promoted the campaign.\n\nThe Evangelical Immigration Table shares links with another organization called the National Immigration Forum. In 2013, for example, the forum provided funding for an Evangelical Immigration Table advertising campaign that promoted immigration reform and was targeted towards Christians.\n\nAccording to figures published by the right-leaning website Breitbart, the National Immigration Forum received just under $3.3 million in grant money from Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundation in 2009 and 2010. In 2013, the forum\u2019s Executive Director Ali Noorani acknowledged (without providing specific details) that it had received some Open Society Foundation funding, but said none of it was used to pay for the ad campaign.\n\nBecause Christianity Today has not received funding from Soros or his Open Society Foundation, and because it is not a \u201cfront organization\u201d for the philanthropist, as Pulpit and Pen falsely claimed, those seeking to discredit the publication by associating it with Soros were forced to stretch and distort the existing facts at their disposal.\n\nAlmost a decade ago, the National Immigration Forum received some funding from a Soros organization. A few years later, the forum paid for a pro-immigration reform advertising campaign by the Evangelical Immigration Table, but no funding from Soros was used in that particular endeavor. Six years later, in 2019, the Evangelical Immigration Table launched another campaign in favor of restitution-based, biblically founded immigration reform. Christianity Today hosted a column written by the Evangelical Immigration Table\u2019s national coordinator, and one of its columnists (Stetzer) publicly supported the campaign.\n\nIt was on the basis of those facts that Pulpit and Pen, DC Dirty Laundry and others reached the factually insupportable conclusion that Christianity Today was \u201cbacked\u201d and funded by Soros. Neither was true.", "lang": "en"}
