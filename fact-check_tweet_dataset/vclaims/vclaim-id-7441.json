The tweet was posted on Aug. 12, 2018, two days before Wisconsin\u2019s primary elections. Schimel ran unopposed in the Republican primary, seeking re-election as the state attorney general, where he leads the Department of Justice (DOJ).\n\nThe text of Schimel\u2019s tweet noted that Wisconsin law requires a photo identification to vote. The reference to beer comes in the 40-second video, which also focuses on the voter ID law and was produced as part of his re-election campaign.\n\nThe video begins with words on the screen, echoed by a narrator, that say:\n\nIntegrity. It matters at the DOJ. And it matters at the ballot box. That\u2019s why Wisconsin voters have said time and again voter ID protects our votes. We need an ID to rent a car, buy a beer, check out a library book. It\u2019s common sense to prove our identity when we vote.\n\nSchimel campaign spokesman Johnny Koremenos, who has also worked as Schimel\u2019s official spokesman at the Department of Justice, defended Schimel\u2019s statement by telling us that getting asked for an ID to buy beer \"is commonplace in bars, liquor stores, and grocery stores across the state. In fact, some stores have policies to ID everybody, regardless of whether age has shown its physical signs or not.\"\n\nBut Schimel didn\u2019t say you might be carded. He said -- likening it to casting a ballot at the polls -- that you need an ID to buy a beer.\n\nIn its publication about alcohol laws for retailers, the state Department of Revenue says retailers should demand proof of age of anyone \"who appears to be under the legal drinking age.\" That is, 21. And the law on alcohol beverages says sellers may require a customer to provide ID.\n\nBut the law does not require that identification be provided to buy a beer.\n\nAs those of us well beyond 21 well know, there are countless times at countless venues where we\u2019ve bought beer without having to show an ID.\n\nWhich is something you can\u2019t get away with at the polling place if you want to vote.\n\nSchimel says: \"We need an ID\" to \"buy a beer.\"\n\nIt\u2019s a particularly misleading statement in the context in which the attorney general made it \u2014 citing the state law that requires a photo ID in order to vote.\n\nIn some places, especially if you look like you might be younger than 21, you might be required to show an ID in order to buy beer. But state law does not require people who want to buy a beer to produce an ID \u2014 as many Wisconsin beer drinkers have known for many years.\n\nFor a statement that contains only an element of truth, we give Schimel a Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
