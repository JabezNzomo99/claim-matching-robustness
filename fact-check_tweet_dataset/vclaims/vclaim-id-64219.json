Steve Rothman has all the makings of a well-crafted, political hit.\n\n \n\n There\u2019s the snarky narrator, a tuxedoed man winking at the camera -- and, of course, some editing to make Rothman\u2019s opponent sound like he\u2019s saying something that he\u2019s not.\n\n \n\n About a month before the two Democratic congressmen face off in the June 5 primary for a newly drawn congressional district, Rothman\u2019s campaign on May 8 posted an ad on YouTube claiming that U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell \"wants more tax cuts for the rich.\"\n\n \n\n The ad goes one step further, suggesting that Pascrell admitted to supporting such tax cuts. Just after the narrator claims the congressman \"wants more tax cuts for the rich,\" the video cuts to a clip of Pascrell saying, \"Republicans had great ideas. I liked some of their ideas.\"\n\n \n\n But PolitiFact New Jersey found that Pascrell\u2019s comments were in reference to reaching a bipartisan compromise on health care reform, not about providing tax cuts.\n\n \n\n Let\u2019s go through the ad.\n\n \n\n The ad opens with a video of Rothman saying, \"I\u2019m Steve Rothman and I approved this message.\" Then we see archival footage of what appears to be wealthy people in tuxedos and cocktail dresses at a party.\n\n \n\n \"Who wants more tax cuts for the rich?\" the narrator intones. \"Mitt Romney, Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich and Bill Pascrell.\" A photo of each man is superimposed on the screen as the narrator says their names.\n\n \n\n The ad immediately turns to a video of Pascrell talking.\n\n \n\n In a clip from an interview on MSNBC\u2019s \"Hardball with Chris Matthews,\" Pascrell says, \"Republicans had great ideas. I liked some of their ideas.\" The ad abruptly turns to the winking, tuxedoed man as the narrator adds: \"Especially if you\u2019re wealthy.\"\n\n \n\n The three-second clip featured in Rothman\u2019s ad was pulled from a nearly eight-minute \"Hardball\" interview from Jan. 25, 2010. During that segment, Pascrell was discussing health care reform, not tax cuts.\n\n \n\n In response to Matthews\u2019 question about reaching a bipartisan deal on health care reform, here is Pascrell\u2019s complete answer:\n\n \n\n \"I really believe that it can happen. And I believe that the president should try again to reach out to the other side. I know he tried to do (it) in the beginning. Mr. Boehner, who\u2019s the leader (of the) Republicans in the House, he chose the path of saying, \u2018Nah, our party\u2019s not gonna support any of this.\u2019 And it really puts the pressure on anybody on the other side who wants to think of some good (ideas). Republicans had great ideas. We had some bipartisan meetings...I liked some of their ideas, and they liked some of our ideas.\"\n\nTo read a transcript of the entire interview or watch it, go here.\n\n \n\n So, Rothman is clearly wrong to suggest Pascrell was endorsing \"more tax cuts for the rich,\" when his statement was about Republicans\u2019 ideas for health care reform.\n\n \n\n Paul Swibinski, a senior adviser to the Rothman campaign, acknowledged in an e-mail that the clip was about health care, but argued it reinforces how \"Bill Pascrell has often caved in to Republicans and negotiated away what progressives stand for.\"\n\n \n\n Pascrell spokesman Sean Darcy responded in an e-mail: \"Steve Rothman's claims to being a progressive fighter fly in the face of the facts and his constant negative attacks against Bill Pascrell have been consistently, directly contradicted by independent verifiers.\"\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n In an attack ad from Rothman\u2019s campaign, the narrator claims Pascrell \"wants more tax cuts for the rich.\" Then the video suggests Pascrell admitted to supporting such tax cuts by showing a clip of him saying, \"Republicans had great ideas. I liked some of their ideas.\"\n\n \n\n But when Pascrell made those comments during a \"Hardball\" interview, the congressman was discussing efforts to reach a bipartisan compromise on health care reform. In fact, the phrase \"tax cuts\" was never mentioned during the entire interview.\n\n \n\n Editing a political ad to distort the meaning behind an opponent\u2019s comments is not just wrong, it\u2019s ridiculous. Pants on Fire!\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "lang": "en"}
