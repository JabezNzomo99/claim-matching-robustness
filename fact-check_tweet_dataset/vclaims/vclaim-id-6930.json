But pay increases are determined by a statutory formula, and Trump in fact requested an amount below the automatic adjustment for 2018. Congress overrode the president\u2019s proposal, and Trump ultimately agreed to fully fund the increase as determined by federal law.\n\nThe president made his remarks in the East Room at the White House on May 9, while discussing the military budget. \u201cAnd, by the way, I know you don\u2019t care about this, but that also includes raises for our military,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst time in 10 years.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t the first pay increase in 10 years. The Defense Department has on its website a list of the annual increases in basic military pay going back to 2007. On Jan. 1, 2018, basic pay increased 2.4 percent \u2014 up from a 2.1 percent increase in 2017 and 1.3 percent in 2016.\n\nWhen we contacted the White House, we were told that Trump was referring to his fiscal year 2019 budget proposal to increase military pay by 2.6 percent, beginning Jan. 1, 2019. That\u2019s not at all what he said, so the president misspoke. Fair enough.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the first time that the president has taken credit for raising military pay that is set by a statutory formula.\n\nIn December, the president signed the National Defense Authorization Act, and the White House put out a press release with no fewer than 10 members of Congress praising the president for raising military pay \u2014 including the tweet below from House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nBut how is the annual increase in military pay determined?\n\nAs we have written before, federal law mandates that military pay raises be equal to the change in the Labor Department\u2019s annual Employment Cost Index, or ECI, for private sector wages.\n\nThe president can \u201cspecify an alternative pay adjustment that supersedes the automatic adjustment,\u201d and Congress can pass legislation that would \u201coverride the automatic adjustment and/or any presidential adjustment if it were enacted,\u201d as explained in an April 2017 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened in the case of the 2018 pay raise. Trump had proposed an increase of 2.1 percent for 2018 \u2014 which was below the ECI. But Congress passed the NDAA with a 2.4 percent increase, as set by the statutory formula, to fully fund the military pay hike.\n\nBasic pay increases have been higher than the ECI in the past.\n\nIn a 2013 report, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said basic military pay exceeded the ECI every year from 2000 to 2010.\n\n\u201cFrom 2000 to 2010, lawmakers approved raises \u2014 including across-the-board increases and, in some cases, additional amounts for personnel at specific seniority levels \u2014 that, on average, exceeded the ECI by 0.5 percentage points,\u201d CBO said.\n\nSince 2011, the pay raise has been equal to or less than ECI, according to the CRS report on military pay. It was less than ECI for three straight years \u2014 from 2014 to 2016 \u2014 because President Obama invoked the \u201calternative pay adjustment\u201d option in those years, and Congress did not override Obama.\n\nSince 2017, it has been equal to ECI, and Trump proposed a raise equal to ECI again in 2019 at 2.6 percent, which the president\u2019s fiscal 2019 budget described as \u201cmodest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis pay raise is equal to the increase in the Employment Cost Index (ECI) for wages and salaries, for private industry workers as called for in law, and it is the highest military pay raise in 9 years,\u201d the budget says.\n\nThat\u2019s what the president meant to say \u2014 \u201cthe highest military pay raise in 9 years\u201d \u2014 without mentioning, as his budget does, that it is equal to the amount \u201ccalled for in law.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
