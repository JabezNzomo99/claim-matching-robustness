This suggests that the voices of people panicking were superimposed to the clip.\n\nAccording to the title, the video shows a \u2018mysterious planet Nibiru.\u2019 However, this is not an actual event but related to a popular doomsday theory debunked by NASA in 2017.\n\nUsing InVid, a video verification tool, Alt News analysed the viral video by performing a reverse image search on Yandex. We found a 2018 report by Turn Back Hoax, an Indonesia-based fact-check platform.\n\nThe outlet debunked the video when several people claimed to post a \u2018Facebook live\u2019 of the event. As per Turn Back Hoax, the video was created using clips that already existed on the internet. \u201cOne of them is published in Youtube here: https://goo.gl/ebNMBm, about \u201cPlanet Nibiru\u201d conspiracy theories,\u201d reads the report. The YouTube video is however unavailable now.\n\nTurn Back Hoax also cites a 2017 article from The Telegraphwhich said, \u201cPlanet X, or Nibiru, refers to a mythological planet in our solar system that will supposedly crash into Earth and wipe out the human race, however it has been consistently dismissed by Nasa and other experts as an internet hoax.\u201d\n\nNASA republished an article around the conspiracy theories in 2012. \u201cThe biggest missing link in the doomsday prophecy is Nibiru itself. Because no giant, rogue planet has been found in the outer solar system to play the role of Nibiru\u2026\u201d reads the article which also quotes NASA\u2019s David Morrison: \u201cThe fact is that these folks are constantly changing their story. For some, Nibiru is no longer the Sumerian god or planet that is supposed to be returning to Earth in late 2012. It has become a catchword for almost any cosmic catastrophe.\u201d\n\nTherefore, the claims that the viral video is from Iraq or shows a catastrophic planet is false.
