We took in some from Japan, you heard about that because they are American citizens, and they are in quarantine. And they are getting better, too. But we felt we had an obligation to do that. It could have been as many as 42.\u201d\n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t Trump be enthusiastic about the prospect of a vaccine? It represents a clear solution. The problem is \u2014 according to Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health \u2014 any vaccine would not be \u201capplicable to the epidemic unless we really wait about a year to a year and a half.\u201d In other words, although NIH is moving the fastest it ever has, there is no chance a vaccine would be ready to help people in proximity to the virus now.\n\n\u201cWell, I really think the stock market, of something I know a lot about, I think it took a hit maybe for two reasons. I think they look at the people that you watched debating last night, and they say, if there's even a possibility that can happen, I think it really takes a hit because of that. And it certainly took a hit because of this. And I understand that also, because of supply chains and various other things, and people coming in. But I think the stock market will recover. The economy is very strong. The consumer is the strongest it has ever been. \u201d\n\n\u201cWe know all the good people. It\u2019s a question I asked the doctors before. Some of the people we cut, they haven\u2019t been used for many, many years. And if they \u2014 if we have a need and we can get them very quickly. And rather than spending the money \u2014 and I\u2019m a business person. I don\u2019t like having thousands of people around when you don\u2019t need them. When we need them, we can get them back very quickly. For instance, we\u2019re bringing some people in tomorrow that are already in this, you know, great government that we have. And very specifically for this. We can build up very, very quickly and we\u2019ve already done that. I mean, we really have built up. We have a great staff.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
