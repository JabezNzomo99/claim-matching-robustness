Mary Landrieu (D-La.), in a very unflattering photograph, is sandwiched between a smirking Bloomberg and a serious-looking Obama. The message is clear \u2014 Landrieu is part of a cabal that \u201cposes a serious threat to your freedoms.\u201d\n\nNote that the ad says that Bloomberg \u201cspends millions\u201d in support of Landrieu. That\u2019s a stretch. NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam says that line stems from the fact that Bloomberg gave $2.5 million to the Senate Majority PAC, which in turn spent more than $2 million on behalf of Landrieu. But Bloomberg\u2019s contribution amounted to just under five percent of the more than $50 million raised by SMP, so on a pro-rated basis it certainly doesn\u2019t add up to \u201cmillions.\u201d\n\nBloomberg has funded the Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund, but it only spent about $335,000 on congressional races this year, none of which went in support of Landrieu, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\n\u201cMike Bloomberg supports a much more intense gun control agenda than what is supported by Mary Landrieu,\u201d Brody added. \u201cBloomberg has backed an assault weapons ban, limitations on high capacity magazines, and other restrictions that Senator Landrieu has voted against. The common ground they share is universal background checks, something supported by the vast majority of Americans that even the NRA admitted to you would not do anything like they claim in their ads.\u201d\n\nLandrieu did receive backing, nearly $600,000, from the group founded by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) and her husband after Giffords was nearly killed with a gun in 2011 by a mentally ill man. That group, Americans for Responsible Solutions, advocates for universal background checks but also says it supports Second Amendment rights.\n\nUltimately, this once again comes down to a dispute over Landrieu\u2019s vote in favor of an amendment to bolster gun background checks, authored by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) and Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Penn.). The amendment, on a vote of 54-46, failed to overcome a Senate filibuster in 2013.\n\nThe Manchin-Toomey proposal was intended as an effort to bridge the wide gap between gun-rights supporters and gun-control advocates over whether to overhaul the current background-check system, which is limited to federally licensed gun dealers. Essentially, the proposals would have expanded background checks to gun shows and Internet sales, but the lawmakers said it would not have affected sales between friends and family members.\n\nDespite the language in the ad, there was nothing in the Manchin-Toomey bill that would have prevented people from buying a weapon to defend themselves, even on short notice \u2014 unless they had criminal records.\n\nAs we have said before, the NRA has every right to offer its interpretation of various proposed laws, or to suggest that a single change in gun laws would take away a person\u2019s rights. But the NRA goes too far when it tries to lump Landrieu in with Bloomberg.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s gun-control group may have endorsed her, but he has spent no money on her behalf, despite the NRA\u2019s claim of \u201cmillions.\u201d He espouses a more expansive gun-control agenda than Landrieu. Their interests may have briefly overlapped on one amendment, Manchin-Toomey, but that\u2019s not enough to declare that there is such a thing as a \u201cObama/Bloomberg/Landrieu gun control agenda.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
