His remarks on \u201c Tucker Carlson Tonight\u201d came days after a mass shooting at an El Paso Walmart left 22 people dead and dozens injured. Investigators said the shooter was motivated by a hatred of Hispanics and pointed to a white supremacist manifesto worrying about \u201ca Hispanic invasion.\u201d Mr. Carlson also likened white supremacy to \u201cthe Russia hoax,\u201d calling it a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d used by Democrats to divide the country. His comments drew a storm of criticism. Brian Stelter of CNN said the comments were \u201cnonsensical.\u201d Margaret Sullivan, the Washington Post media columnist, flat-out called him \u201cwrong.\u201d On social media, the hashtag #FireTuckerCarlson became a trending term. On Wednesday afternoon, even the Fox News anchor Shepard Smith said that \u201cwhite nationalism is without question a very serious problem in America.\u201d It was an aside that some interpreted as criticism although he did not name anyone.\n\nMr. Carlson did not return a call requesting an interview on Wednesday. In a follow-up segment on his program that night, he said that while \u201cracism is one of America\u2019s problems,\u201d all supporters of President Trump were improperly being labeled white supremacists. Divisive rhetoric distracted from other issues facing the country and that could lead to greater conflict, he added. On Wednesday night\u2019s show, Mr. Carlson also announced plans to take a vacation, saying that he would be \u201cheaded to the wilderness\u201d to fish with his son. A Fox News spokesperson told CNN that Mr. Carlson\u2019s vacation had been long planned. Mr. Carlson said he would return on Aug. 19. Here is a look at the facts behind his earlier claims.\n\nDespite that call for unity, Mr. Trump\u2019s critics say he is responsible for the rise in racial division in the country. Among their examples: his false claims that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States; his campaign statement that Mexican immigrants were \u201crapists\u201d; his claim that there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d of a clash between white nationalists and counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Va.; and, most notably, his recent tweets saying four minority congresswomen should \u201cgo back\u201d to their countries. (All are United States citizens, and three of them were born in America.) If you were to assemble a list, a hierarchy of concerns of problems this country faces, where would white supremacy be on the list? Right up there with Russia, probably. It\u2019s actually not a real problem in America. White extremist ideology isn\u2019t entirely to blame for mass shootings and other violence in recent years. No evidence suggests the Dayton gunman was a white supremacist, for example. But some of the deadliest mass shootings in this country, and elsewhere, have their roots in such beliefs, according to law enforcement experts, scholars and many independent news organizations. Even Fox News itself has cited the existence of \u201cwhite supremacy,\u201d such as in headlines describing the man who drove through a crowd of demonstrators at the Charlottesville rally in August 2017, killing one. The suspect in the El Paso shooting, the largest domestic terrorist attack against Hispanics in modern history , is believed to have posted a white supremacist manifesto online in which he wrote of a \u201cHispanic invasion of Texas.\u201d Critics like Ms. Sullivan of The Washington Post and the liberal watchdog group Media Matters pointed out that Mr. Carlson has used the word \u201cinvasion\u201d multiple times when discussing immigration problems at the border. At one point Mr. Carlson said, \u201cThis is an invasion, and it\u2019s terrifying.\u201d The combined membership of every white supremacist organization in this country would be able to fit inside a college football stadium. According to the NCAA, the country\u2019s largest college football stadiums hold about 100,000. Bob Hopkinson, a spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, said tracking membership numbers is \u201cextremely difficult.\u201d \u201cGroups are either extremely private about membership numbers or they exaggerate them,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we do know is that there are more than 300,000 people registered as users on the oldest hate site, Stormfront, and that number doubled when President Obama was in office.\u201d\n\nHe also said another prominent hate site, The Daily Stormer, had about 400,000 page views a month until it was \u201crun off the web\u201d after the Charlottesville clashes. Precise numbers aside, the center says hate crimes and hate groups are on the rise in America. The number of groups rose by 7 percent to 1,020 in 2018, and the number of white nationalist groups rose nearly 50 percent to 148 that year. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, domestic terrorism is increasingly motivated by white supremacist ideology. The director of the bureau, Christopher Wray, called white supremacy and other forms of domestic extremism as a \u201cpersistent, pervasive threat.\u201d (Mr. Wray was appointed by President Trump and unanimously confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate.) This is a hoax. Just like the Russia hoax. This is a conspiracy theory used to divide the country and keep a hold on power. It is unclear whether he was referring to Russian election interference itself or allegations of Trump administration involvement. The two-year investigation led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, produced a thick report and lengthy Congressional testimony. Mr. Mueller found Russian interference in all 50 states. During his testimony, he issued a strong warning on election tampering. \u201cThey\u2019re doing it as we sit here,\u201d he told Congress. As for Mr. Trump, while Mr. Mueller\u2019s 448-page report \u201cdoes not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,\u201d according to the summary. They\u2019re making this up and it\u2019s a talking point, which they are using to help them in this election cycle. Here, Mr. Carlson was referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s Democratic opponents. Several of the Democratic candidates for president, including Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., have accused Mr. Trump of feeding racial division. Beto O\u2019Rourke, an El Paso native, discussed the president in a MSNBC interview following the deadly attack in his hometown. \u201cOf course he\u2019s racist,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s been racist from Day 1.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
