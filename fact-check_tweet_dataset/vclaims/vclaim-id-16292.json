They have produced four reports thus far, researching four different time periods, each one stating that Syrian government forces used chemical weapons.\n\nIn August, Amnesty International condemned an alleged chorine gas attack by Syrian forces in Aleppo, saying it signals an intensifying use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime.\n\nRussia, however, said in recent days that Syrian rebels used chemical weapons against the Syrian army in Aleppo. But rebel commanders say they have no such weapons.", "lang": "en"}
