The claim is false; the video shows people in Aceh celebrating the adoption of a new flag and official symbol for the province in April 2013.\n\nThe three-minute, 18-second clip was posted here on Facebook on August 31, 2019, and has since been viewed more than 23,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nTranslated to English, the Indonesian-language caption reads: \u201cAceh Referendum. It\u2019s evidence of the incompetence of the country\u2019s leader.\u201d\n\nThe same clip was also published on Facebook alongside a similar claim here.\n\nAceh is a province of Indonesia, located in the northern end of Sumatra.\n\nThe area was home to a long-running separatist insurgency that killed around 15,000 people before a peace deal between the Indonesian government and rebels in 2005, as this article by The Jakarta Post explains.\n\nCalls for a referendum on independence from Indonesia have persisted despite the peace deal. Former commander of the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) Muzakir Manaf, who is now chairman of the Aceh Party, floated the idea of an independence ballot as recently as May 2019, as BBC Indonesia reported here.\n\nBut the claim is false; the video actually shows people in Aceh celebrating the ratification of a law that established an official flag and symbol for the province in April 2013.\n\nA Google keyword search found the same video uploaded on YouTube on April 1, 2013, on a channel called atjehpost.tv aceh.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the video in the misleading post (L) and the original video (R):\n\nTranslated to English, the title of the video reads: \u201cPeusijuek a Giant Flag in Banda Aceh\u201d.\n\nThe caption says: \u201cAround 1,000 people hold a flag convoy in Banda Aceh, Monday, April 1, 2013. At the Banda Aceh Grand Mosque, the coordinator of Nanggroe Aceh Ulema Council (MUNA) conducted a traditional peusijuek ritual for a giant flag of 13x6 meter. The flag convoy was held after Aceh administration and Aceh Legislative Council ratified Qanun No.3 of 2013 on the Symbol and Flag of Aceh.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeusijeuk\u201d is a traditional Acehnese religious ritual, according to this website of the Aceh Customs Council in Banda Aceh.\n\n\u201cMajelis Ulama Nanggroe Aceh (MUNA)\u201d refers to the Nanggroe Aceh Ulema Council, a political organisation comprising Muslim clerics under the leadership of the Aceh Party.\n\nBanda Aceh Grand Mosque is located in Banda Aceh, the provincial capital.\n\n\u201cQanun\u201d refers to the regional law in Aceh province and its districts, which has been in place since 2006. Qanun No. 3 of 2013 refers to the law on Aceh\u2019s flag and symbol, which was enacted in March 2013.\n\nThe event shown in the video was reported by multiple Indonesian news sites at the time, including here and here.", "lang": "en"}
