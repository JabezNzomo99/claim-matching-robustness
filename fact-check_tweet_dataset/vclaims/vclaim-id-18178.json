And they have the most comprehensive systems.\u201d\n\nFinland, South Korea and Canada have done consistently well in tests that compare 15-year olds in different countries.\n\nWe compared the last three rounds of rankings from 2006, 2009 and 2012. Finland, South Korea and Canada were consistently placed in the top 10 for Science and Reading globally, although Finland and Canada slipped to 12th and 13th for Maths in 2012.\n\nThey\u2019re not the only countries that have done consistently well in these tests. Looking at 2009 and 2012, four other regions have scored consistently within the top ten in reading, five others in science and seven others in maths.\n\nAs we\u2019ve discussed previously, these tests aren\u2019t a perfect guide to the relative performance of different education systems.\n\nFinland\u2019s state schools are comprehensive and unstreamed until pupils are 16. Canada has mainly comprehensive schools to 18, since the majority of upper secondary schools offer vocational and academic streams. South Korea\u2019s schools are comprehensive until pupils are 15, which is the end of compulsory education.\n\nSo far, we haven\u2019t seen any definitive evidence that the success of these systems is due to the fact that their systems are largely comprehensive. We\u2019ll be looking into this further.", "lang": "en"}
