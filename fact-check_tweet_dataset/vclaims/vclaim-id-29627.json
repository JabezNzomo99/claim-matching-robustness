Kamala Harris would restrict the use of weapons by police.\n\nA bogus story about new regulations on police officers has stirred up anger on social media and has been presented as legitimate news by a nationally syndicated talk-radio show.\n\nThe made-up story claims that Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who is one of several politicians running for the Democratic nomination for president, has sponsored legislation that would require permission from a supervisor before a police officer is allowed to use a weapon. The story says, \u201cAs part of the bill, officers finding themselves in a life threatening situation would first need to call their supervisor and ask before introducing their service weapon into the scenario. Further, the supervisor would then in turn have to call a local civilian committee to discuss the matter so that a community backed decision can be made.\u201d\n\nA search of the Congressional Record shows that Harris has sponsored no such legislation.\n\nBut it\u2019s obvious that the whole thing is fabricated because the story is labeled as satire on the website that originally published it. A website called BNN, or Blue News Network, posted the story on March 12, and the site describes its content as satire at the bottom of each page. It says on its \u201cabout us\u201d page: \u201cIf you haven\u2019t figured it out yet, this is a satirical news website.\u201d\n\nThat disclaimer doesn\u2019t show up on many of the Facebook pages that shared the story, though. There, readers left comments such as, \u201cShe is too stupid to be in Congress much less run for President\u201d and, \u201cIt\u2019s easier to ask forgiveness than it is to ask permission\u2026shoot first\u2026ask questions later\u2026.this women is a TOTAL MORON.\u201d\n\nFacebook users weren\u2019t the only ones who were fooled. Several blogs have reposted the story as though it were legitimate news, and \u201cThe Ben Ferguson Show,\u201d which is aired on more than 70 radio stations across the country, according to the show\u2019s website, posted the story among news articles on its official site.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cNew Bill Would Require Officers to Call Supervisor Before Drawing Weapons.\u201d BlueNewsNetwork.com. 12 Mar 2019.\n\n\u201cNew Bill Would Require Officers to Call Supervisor Before Drawing Weapons.\u201d The Ben Ferguson Show. 600wrec.iheart.com. 12 Mar 2019.", "lang": "en"}
