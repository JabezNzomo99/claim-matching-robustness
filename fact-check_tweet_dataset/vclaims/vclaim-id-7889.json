He addressed many topics we have previously fact-checked and others we haven\u2019t, with a mix of accuracy. Here\u2019s an assessment of factual claims from his speech.\n\n\"We have created more than 2 million new jobs since the election. Substantially more.\"\n\nTrump cites an accurate number. The official figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that between December 2016 and December 2017, the number of employed Americans rose by 2,055,000.\n\nThat said, no president deserves full credit (or blame) for employment increases on their watch, since broader economic factors beyond their control \u2014 including international economic conditions and technological and demographic changes \u2014 play significant roles in driving hiring.\n\nThat\u2019s especially true given that Trump included two months during which his predecessor, Barack Obama, was in office. If you start counting in February 2017 rather than December 2016, the total doesn\u2019t reach the 2 million threshold Trump cited \u2014 it works out to 1,607,000 additional jobs.\n\n\"Economic growth has surged past 3 percent, something that wasn\u2019t supposed to happen for a long time. We\u2019re way ahead of schedule.\"\n\nWhile economic growth has been robust, Trump is exaggerating here.\n\nIn the second and third quarter of 2017, annualized GDP growth did reach 3.1 percent and 3.2 percent. But the first quarter of 2017 had growth of only 1.2 percent, meaning that the first three quarters collectively saw less than 3 percent growth. (The final 2017 growth figures will only be determined once the fourth-quarter growth rate is finalized.)\n\nMore to the point, it was hardly unprecedented to get 3 percent growth under Obama. In fact, it happened eight times during Obama\u2019s 32 quarters in office, or about one-fourth of the time. Growth under Obama reached or exceeded 4 percent four times on a quarterly basis and peaked at 5.2 percent.\n\nTrump has a long way to go before he can crow about consistent 3 percent growth, and experts are skeptical that he or any president these days can accomplish it, given economic and demographic trends.\n\nTrump is correct. The unemployment rate for December 2017 was 4.1 percent, unchanged from the previous two months. The last time it was lower than that was between September 2000 and December 2000, when it was 3.9 percent. That\u2019s 17 years ago.\n\n\"African-American unemployment is the lowest it\u2019s ever been in the history of our records.\"\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted, in December 2017, African-American unemployment fell to 6.8 percent. That\u2019s a record low since the statistic was first calculated in 1972. The previous record low was 7 percent in April 2000 and September 2017.\n\n\"The stock market is hitting one all-time record after another, boosting your 401(k)s and retirement accounts for everyday Americans.\"\n\nJust weeks after winning the 2016 presidential election, the Dow Jones Industrial Average passed the 19,000 mark. On Trump\u2019s watch, it has proceeded to cross the 20,000 mark, the 21,000 mark, the 22,000 mark, the 23,000 mark, the 24,000 mark, and the 25,000 mark \u2014 the last milestone reached after just 25 trading days.\n\nThat\u2019s a significant rise, though as we have noted, other presidents, notably Obama, have also presided over large rises in the Dow.\n\nAs for how many \"everyday Americans\" have 401(k) retirement-savings accounts, they are perhaps more limited than Trump suggests. According to Census Bureau data cited by the Motley Fool, a financial website, only 32 percent of Americans are using a 401(k), a percentage that is relatively low because many companies don\u2019t offer one, especially smaller employers. So many Americans aren\u2019t directly sharing in the stock market\u2019s rise.\n\n\"Based on the (rise in) stocks, 39 (percent returns) is not that good. You\u2019re not really doing that well\" if you\u2019re only getting 39 percent.\n\nTrump offered this observation as part of an anecdote about a New York police officer who told him, \"My 401(k) is up 39 percent.\"\n\nIn reality, a 39 percent annual return would be remarkably good.\n\nThe Dow increased by 25 percent in 2017. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500, a broader market measure, rose by 19 percent, while the NASDAQ rose by 28 percent. So if the police officer saw a 39 percent gain during 2017, he\u2019s beating the market by a lot.\n\n\"And we have just signed into law the most significant tax cuts and reforms in American history.\"\n\nWe won\u2019t judge whether the tax bill Trump just signed is \"the most significant\" in history, but it\u2019s not the biggest. As we\u2019ve noted, even the most expansive estimate of the recent tax bill tax cut is exceeded by President Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1981 tax cut in inflation-adjusted dollars, and as a percentage of GDP, a half-dozen or more previous tax cuts were larger.\n\nWe\u2019ve rated a nearly identical claim Mostly False. The law does cut taxes by roughly that much, but citing only the tax cuts ignores that the bill also includes $4 trillion in tax increases, for a net of $1.5 trillion in tax cuts. Trump is misleadingly suggesting that the cuts are greater than they are on balance, once all provisions are counted.\n\n\"Most of those benefits (from the tax bill are) going to working families, small businesses, and who? The family farmer.\"\n\nMany, though not all, Americans will see a tax cut, at least in the early years. But the benefits mostly go to the wealthiest Americans. As this chart shows, the biggest gains accrue to the relatively small number of households earning more than $100,000, and the gains to those earning over $1 million a year receive a gain that\u2019s massively disproportionate compared to their share of the population.\n\nMeanwhile, the tax gains shrink or disappear for most Americans by 2027, as this chart shows.\n\n\"Every Democrat in the House and every Democrat in the Senate voted against tax cuts for the American farmer and for the American worker.\"\n\nTrump is correct that no Democrat in either chamber voted for the tax bill.\n\n\"If the Democrats ever had the chance, the first thing they would do is get rid of it and raise up your taxes, sometimes by 40, 50, 60 percent higher than you\u2019re paying right now.\"\n\nIt\u2019s hard to predict what Democrats would do to change tax policy if they managed to regain control of Congress -- for starters, they would need to overcome a Trump veto to enact anything before 2020, making any potential changes a tough climb -- but Trump exaggerates the scale by which Democrats would have raised taxes had Hillary Clinton been elected president in 2016.\n\nThe Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center\u2019s analysis of Clinton\u2019s tax plan concluded that \"nearly all of the tax increases would fall on the highest-income 1 percent; on average, low- and middle-income households would see small increases in after-tax income.\" Like Trump, Clinton would have increased the child tax credit and modified taxation of multinational corporations, among other things.\n\n\"Under this new law, the typical family of four earning $75,000 will see an income tax cut of more than $2,000 each.\"\n\nWe rated a similar claim Half True. We noted that the tax impact on families would vary significantly given their specific financial circumstances. Also, the gains start to shrink and eventually turns into a tax hike as time goes on, due to expiring tax breaks and slower inflation adjustment calculations.\n\n\"American businesses are going from the highest tax rate in the developed world last year \u2014 the highest in the developed world, think of it \u2014 to one of the most competitive this year. From 35 percent \u2014 which is unacceptable \u2014 all the way down to 21 percent.\"\n\nTrump has often said that the United States is the most highly taxed nation in the world, an assertion we\u2019ve rated False. But tweaking the claim slightly to specify that the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world makes it accurate. In his Nashville speech, Trump correctly described the comparison.\n\n\"From now on, most family farms and small-business owners will be spared \u2014 and you\u2019re going to be spared, and it really is the word punishment of the deeply unfair estate tax, known as the death tax \u2014 so you can keep your farms in the family.\"\n\nSupporters of eliminating the estate tax often cite farmers and small businesses as examples of sympathetic victims of the tax. But there are actually very few farmers and small business owners who are hit by the tax in any given year.\n\nBecause the tax only kicked in for estates bigger than about $5.5 million in 2017, only 5,460 estates paid the tax annually, according to credible estimates. Of those estates, about 80 represented small businesses or farms.\n\nThe new law keeps the estate tax in place but increases the amount that can be shielded from taxation. Under the new provision, the tax will affect estates of at least $11.2 million, or $22.4 million for couples. That means that even fewer small businesses and farms will have to worry about the tax.\n\nFinally, it is only known as the \"death tax\" by critics of the levy. It doesn\u2019t tax death -- it only taxes estates larger than the vast majority of Americans will ever stand to inherit.", "lang": "en"}
