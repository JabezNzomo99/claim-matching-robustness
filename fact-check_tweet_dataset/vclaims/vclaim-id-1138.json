The video is unrelated to the incident and is from 2019.\n\nThe footage shows a huge ball of fire illuminating the night sky, and has been reuploaded on dozens of social media accounts in English, Persian and Arabic (here , here , here, here, here) with captions that link it to events in Tehran.\n\nAn Iranian defence ministry spokesman told state TV that an explosion occurred near Tehran in the early hours of June 26. The spokesman said it happened in a \u201cpublic area\u201d of Parchin - close to where a sensitive military site is based (here).\n\nPhotos of the explosion from Iran's ISNA news agency show an orange flash and a plume of smoke (here).\n\nThe video being shared in the posts referenced above is not from Iran at all. It was originally captured by a drone and shows the moment of an explosion at an oil refinery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This incident happened in June 2019 and the video featured in news reports from the time (here).\n\nSatellite imagery from Google Maps can be matched with the video showing the Philadelphia blast. It was captured from over the state border in New Jersey, and the location where the Delaware River forks off toward Westville can be seen clearly in the video (bit.ly/2BJaG2s).\n\nFalse. The footage does not show an explosion at a gas storage facility near Tehran.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
