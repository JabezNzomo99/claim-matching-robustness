{"title": "Bogus Story on Cohen Raid", "subtitle": "", "author": "www.factcheck.org", "date": "2018-04-11T16:27:27+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-10275", "url": "https://www.factcheck.org/2018/04/bogus-story-on-cohen-raid/", "vclaim": "Q: Did a federal judge rule that evidence collected from Michael Cohen\u2019s office is inadmissible?\n\nA: No. That claim was invented by a website that labels its content as satire.\n\nThe FBI seized records from Michael Cohen, one of President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyers, on April 9.\n\nStephen Ryan, the lawyer representing Cohen, said in a statement that the raid was partly related to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. It is unclear what will happen to the evidence agents collected.\n\nWhat is clear is that a federal judge has not ruled that the evidence is \u201ccompletely illegal and inadmissible in any court of law.\u201d\n\nThat claim was made up by a self-described satirical website and copied by another site that posted it on Facebook as if were real news. Users of the social media site flagged the story as potentially false. It is.\n\nThe story originated on a website called Daily World Update, which is part of a network of sites that labels its content as satire aimed at conservatives. But it was copied by a site called Only Politics, which has no satire disclaimer, and was shared on at least four different Trump-themed Facebook pages with a combined following of 850,000. Each of the people who posted the story on those pages appear to live outside of the U.S. Three of them say on their Facebook profiles that they live outside of the U.S., and the fourth doesn\u2019t provide a location, but \u201clikes\u201d several politicians and sports teams from Kosovo.\n\nThe story draws on existing discord over Mueller\u2019s investigation, which Trump has called a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d The president also referred to the raid on Cohen as \u201cA TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!!\u201d So, the made-up story claims that the judge who tossed the evidence from the Cohen raid called his ruling a \u201cpolitically motivated favor.\u201d\n\nBut, the judge named in the story doesn\u2019t even exist; he\u2019s a completely made-up character. There has never been a federal judge named \u201cEarl Manuel Mariano,\u201d according to records kept by the Federal Judicial Center.\n\nThe court doesn\u2019t exist, either. There is no \u201cNorthern California 43rd Circuit Federal and State Court of Appeals.\u201d The federal court system is separate from state court systems. The federal appellate court that covers California is the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. There are 13 total federal appellate courts below the U.S. Supreme Court, not 43.\n\nAnother red flag indicating that the story is bogus are the hyperlinks: one goes to a picture of Jim Carrey in the 1994 movie \u201cDumb and Dumber;\u201d the link attached to the word \u201cclerk\u201d goes to a picture from another 1994 movie, \u201cClerks\u201c; and the last one takes readers to a Google search for the word \u201cdumbass.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201cBREAKING: Federal Judge Tosses Michael Cohen Warrant And All Evidence With It.\u201d DailyWorldUpdate.com. 9 Apr 2018.\n\nTrump, Donald. \u201cThis is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!\u201d Twitter. 18 May 2017.\n\nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts. \u201cComparing Federal & State Courts.\u201d UScourts.gov.
