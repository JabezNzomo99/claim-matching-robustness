Rand Paul says the U.S. doesn't have to default if it breaches the debt ceiling.  Is that possible?", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-05-01T14:49:19Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-86010", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2013/10/11/rand-pauls-claim-that-there-is-no-reason-for-us-to-default/", "vclaim": "The debt ceiling is set at $16.699 trillion, for both publicly traded bonds and intergovernmental obligations such as Social Security, and the United States actually hit it back in the middle of May. But the Treasury has juggled money around in an effort to keep from going over the debt limit. But by most estimates, sometime between Oct. 17 and Nov. 1, the game of financial musical chairs must end and Treasury would no longer be able to pay all bills that are due.\n\nPaul\u2019s main point is Treasury should be able to prioritize its payments, an aide said. In other words, it would choose to pay just the interest on the bonds held by Wall Street and foreign investors (such as the Chinese and Japanese governments) while stiffing other creditors. For instance, IRS refunds could be delayed or federal salaries withheld.\n\nPaul\u2019s aides pointed to a 1985 General Accounting Office report that the \u201cTreasury is free to liquidate obligations in any order it finds will best serve the interests of the United States.\u201d But both the Treasury Department and the Congressional Research Service say that there is tremendous legal uncertainty about whether some payments could be honored while others ignored if the nation goes above the borrowing limit.\n\nAfter the 2011 showdown, Treasury concluded that \u201cthe least harmful option available to the country at the time, of these very bad options,\u201d was a delayed payment regime. In other words, Treasury would only pay all of the bills for a particular day once it had collected enough cash for every outstanding claim due that day.\n\nSo, in theory, Monday\u2019s payments would be held until, say, Wednesday. Then, Tuesday\u2019s payments would be held until enough money was collected for that day\u2019s payments, which could be Thursday or Friday. So the government could start the following week already three days behind in payments \u2014 and continue to fall ever farther back.\n\nBut if this even were possible, would it be advisable? Steve Bell, who worked on Wall Street and was a former staff director of the Senate Budget Committee under Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.), says the financial markets likely would judge any delay in payments related to the debt ceiling as an effective default and would punish U.S. Treasuries accordingly by demanding higher interest rates on U.S. securities.\n\nDuring the 2011 debt ceiling confrontation, elevated interest rates cost taxpayers $1.3 billion, according to the GAO. Over 10 years, Bell says, the impact of that relatively minor blip totals nearly $19 billion. In other words, if Wall Street decided that a delay in some payments meant the same thing as an actual default, traders could demand the same kind of rates as if the government had defaulted \u2014 at a substantial cost to U.S. taxpayers.\n\n\u201cMarkets would be unhappy if the government didn\u2019t pay any bills but it would be much, much worse if they didn\u2019t pay interest on the government debt,\u201d Feldstein said in an e-mail. \u201cI imagine that the government is not writing checks to some suppliers, etc. now but the markets are not upset because they know it will come later. So from a \u2018fact checking\u2019 point of view, the fact is that the government can avoid defaulting on the debt payments.\u201d\n\nOn a theoretical level, it might be possible to just pay interest on the national debt, while delaying payments to others, and thus avoid an actual default on the national debt. But the Treasury Department has argued it is not actually possible to pick and choose, and that instead it could only delay payments.", "lang": "en"}
