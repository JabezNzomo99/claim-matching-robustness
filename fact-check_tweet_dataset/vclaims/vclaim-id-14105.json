More proof,\u201d one individual who shared the image on Facebook wrote in the caption.\n\nThis claim has been routinely debunked over the years as a hoax.\n\nThis claim crops up regularly, with each image alleging that an HIV-positive PepsiCo employee had admitted to contaminating Pepsi products with his blood. The claim warned against drinking Pepsi products for the \u201cnext few weeks.\u201d\n\nThe full claim reads: \u201cThere\u2019s news from the police. Its [sic] an urgent message for all. For the next few weeks please do not drink any product from PEPSI like Pepsi, Tropicana juice, Slice, 7up etc. A worker from the company has admitted that he added his blood contaminated with AIDS. Watch MDTV. It was shown yesterday on Sky News. Please forward and warn others too.\u201d\n\nHowever, The Daily Caller found no evidence of this news story being shared on Sky News or any other news outlet, except in order to debunk similar posts.\n\nWhen we asked PepsiCo about the claim, a spokesperson responded via email, \u201cWe want to reassure you that this is a false rumor and there is absolutely no truth it. Pepsi is safe to drink and there\u2019s no cause for alarm.\u201d\n\nThe claim is also vague, saying there was \u201cnews from the police\u201d without giving a location.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that \u201cyou can\u2019t get HIV from consuming food handled by someone with HIV. Even if the food contained small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen, exposure to the air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid would destroy the virus.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
