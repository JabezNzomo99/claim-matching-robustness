Over 9,500 people have lost their lives in the country due to the pandemic.\n\nA two-minute video which shows people looting a mall has gone viral on social media. The claim associated with the video suggests that people in America are looting malls due to a fear of coronavirus. On the bottom right, one can spot a CNN logo with the news flash \u2013 \u201cBREAKING NEWS Organized theft of malls in California, Virginia, York and other cities due to fears of a corona virus.\u201d\n\nKuwait-based social media celebrity Bibi Alabdulmohsen shared the viral video on Twitter (archive link). She quote-tweeted a tweet which said, \u201cMalls stormed America in California. Virginia. New York. And other states (translated from \u0627\u0642\u062a\u062d\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0628\u0627\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0643\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0641\u0648\u0631\u0646\u0627 . \u0641\u064a\u0631\u062c\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0627 . \u0646\u064a\u0648\u064a\u0648\u0631\u0643 . \u0648 \u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u062e\u0631\u0649).\u201d\n\nAlt News has received several requests to fact-check the viral video on WhatsApp (+91 76000 11160) and on our official Android application.\n\nAlt News performed a keywords search on YouTube and noticed that a similar-looking mall was looted in Veracruz, Mexico three years ago.\n\nUsing this as a clue, we performed another keyword search but with Spanish keywords \u2018saqueo de centros comerciales\u2019 (translation of \u2018mall looting\u2019 by Google). The viral video was also published by a YouTube account Fernando Mojica J on January 6, 2017.\n\nAccording to the description, the video shows the looting at Chedraui Ponti mall Veracruz on January 4, 2017. A January 5, 2017 report by Bloombergconfirms the incident. According to the report, people responded to a hike in gasoline prices by looting several malls. The viral video has been clipped from the 1:46 mark.\n\nReaders should note that the breaking news text and CNN logo has been morphed. The screenshot below compares stills from two videos which shows a man wearing number 12 jersey.\n\nTherefore the claim associated with the viral video is false and misleading. Americans did not loot malls in the US fearing coronavirus pandemic but the video represents an old incident from Mexico.", "lang": "en"}
