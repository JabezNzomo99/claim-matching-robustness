But what did he actually do?", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2015-10-01T14:05:29Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-82286", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/01/cruzs-claim-that-he-spent-much-of-my-adult-life-in-law-enforcement/", "vclaim": "Briefly stated, starting in June 1995, after graduating from Harvard Law School, Cruz spent two years as a law clerk (including to then Supreme Court Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist), nearly two years as an associate at a law firm, a year as an advisor to the 2000 Bush campaign (including a stint in Florida during the recount battles), six months at DOJ headquarters developing policy, nearly two years as director of policy planning at the Federal Trade Commission, 5 1/2 years as Texas Solicitor General and nearly five years heading the appellate practice at Morgan Lewis & Bockius LLP.\n\nOne the highlights of his career was when he was solicitor general, winning a 6-3 vote at the Supreme Court in 2008 in the case (Medellin v. Texas) of a Mexican gang leader who had brutally gang-raped and murdered two teenage girls. Although the International Court of Justice had ruled that a failure by state authorities to allow foreign citizens to notify their consulates entitled the criminals to a review of their convictions \u2014 a position backed by the Bush administration \u2014 Cruz convinced the Court that it was not binding unless Congress had enacted law implementing World Court decisions.\n\nIn the most expansive definition, that would include Cruz\u2019s stints at the DOJ (six months as associate deputy attorney general) and the Texas Attorney General\u2019s office (5\u00bd years as solicitor general). Those jobs did not directly involve criminal investigations and arresting criminals, but broadly speaking they did include enforcing the law. As solicitor general, in fact, Cruz was often seeking to change the understanding of the law\u2014 and represent Texas at the Supreme Court. He heightened Texas\u2019s profile, joining cases supporting gun-owners\u2019 rights and states\u2019 rights, among others.\n\nNote that Cruz said \u201cmuch of his adult life\u201d was spent in law enforcement. He obviously was an adult in college and law school, but we\u2019re not going to count that; it seems more fair to just focus on his work history. (He did, however, spearhead efforts to fight rape on campus as a college student at Princeton University.)\n\nGenerally, we\u2019d say that \u201cmuch\u201d means more than half. That\u2019s probably one reason why the spokeswoman also highlighted the fact that he was \u201can attorney in private practice.\u201d That would add almost seven years to his total in \u201claw enforcement.\u201d But it\u2019s also a harder case to make.\n\nIn particular, during his nearly five years at Morgan Lewis, Cruz headed the appeals practice. That means he was mostly advocating on behalf of people or companies that had lost earlier cases in which they had been charged with criminal or suspect behavior.\n\nMother Jones magazine highlighted several other cases: \u201cHe was a lawyer for Kraft in a major lawsuit against Starbucks. He represented Pfizer when a California county accused the drug manufacturer and other pharmaceutical firms of overcharging\u2026. He defended Eagle Freight Systems when drivers sued the company seeking unpaid overtime wages and expenses. \u2026In a controversial move, he represented a Pennsylvania developer who was a central player in a corruption scandal that exploited juveniles, handling a dispute this crooked developer had with his insurance company.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone needs a bureaucratic dictionary definition to understand that those who prosecute criminals are an important part of enforcing the laws of the land,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cAnd that is what Sen. Cruz spent many years of his career doing. He\u2019s been very straightforward about his work as SG and in private practice.\u201d\n\nCruz is exaggerating his law-enforcement credentials. To claim that \u201cmuch\u201d of his adult life was spent in law enforcement really suggests at least half of his career, whereas the best-case scenario would be one-third. Even then, he was never a prosecutor or litigated criminal cases \u2014 and in private practice, he certainly defended criminals.\n\nWe struggled with whether this merited a Two or a Three, but in the end tipped just slightly toward Three. It would have made a difference if Cruz had actually been a prosecutor or more directly involved in criminal investigations. It is also significant that Cruz often makes this statement. Still, it was a close call.\n\nThis article ignores that Cruz argued multiple capital and criminal appeals and personally supervised and approved thousands of criminal appeals over his tenure. With one sleight of hand, the Post arbitrarily transforms Cruz\u2019s statement into a lie not by analyzing the substance of his comment, but instead by engaging in a battle of dictionary definitions. The center of this article\u2019s argument is that \u201cmuch\u201d means \u201cmore than half.\u201d False. That would be the word, \u201cmost.\u201d Cruz did not use the word \u201cmost\u201d he said \u201cmuch of\u201d which in fact means \u201ca substantial portion.\u201d Six years in DOJ and as Texas SG over an 18 year career fits the bill. The only Pinnochios being awarded should go to the Washington Post.", "lang": "en"}
