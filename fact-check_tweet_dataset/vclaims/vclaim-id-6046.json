This is equal to around US$1 billion at current exchange rates.\n\nWas the hit on Kenya\u2019s stock exchange as hard as Ruto made out? We checked.\n\nReached for the source of the deputy president\u2019s data, his spokesman David Mugonyi told Africa Check that the figure was the value of money lost after market capitalisation at the\n\nThe source of the figure was the\n\n, an industry lobby for private business, Mugonyi said.\n\non 7 September, the business lobby used a higher figure. \u201cLast week\u2019s erosion of KSh130 billion from the Nairobi securities exchange market capitalisation in two days of trading, is surely a sign of the business community\u2019s fears,\u201d it said.\n\nThe Kenya Private Sector Alliance told Africa Check that they had sourced the figure from the Nairobi Securities Exchange.\n\nWhat do the numbers show?\n\nshowed market capitalisation at the stock exchange rose from KSh2.32 trillion (US$22.49 billion) on 27 July to KSh2.48 trillion (US$24.1 billion) on 31 August \u2013 the eve of the court ruling.\n\nat the stock exchange following the announcement by the judiciary but restarted shortly.\n\nfrom the exchange showed that market capitalisation dropped to KSh2.39 trillion on the day - or by about KSh90 billion.\n\n\u201cNo one likes uncertainty especially if the uncertainty period is as long as 60 days,\u201d Reuters news wire quoted Ken Minjire, head of securities at Nairobi-based Genghis Capital, as saying on the day.\n\nOn the next full trading day, 4 September, the value of all shares at the stock market\n\nby a further KSh38 billion to KSh2.35 trillion. In the two days following the ruling, market capitalisation fell by about KSh128 billion - close to the business lobby\u2019s figure.\n\n\u2018It made sense to exit at that point\u2019\n\nBut on 8 September, two days before Ruto made his claim, the value of shares at the market had\n\nto KSh2.43 trillion, a gain of about KSh80 billion.

Many of those losses have since been recovered, with a significant share recouped before Ruto made the claim\n\nHis statement, while mostly correct about a big stock market loss, is understated by KSh28 billion (US$271 million).
