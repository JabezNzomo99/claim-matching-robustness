Everyone wants a magical solution to their problems, and everyone refuses to believe in magic.\u201d\n\nThe quote does not appear in any of Carroll\u2019s works, nor in any film adaptations of his novel \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland.\u201d It is actually a line from ABC\u2019s television show \u201cOnce Upon a Time.\u201d\n\nCharles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known by his pen name Lewis Carroll, wrote numerous literary works in the 19th century, including the children\u2019s classic \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland\u201d and its sequel \u201cThrough the Looking-Glass.\u201d\n\nHowever, nowhere in these works, or any of his other writings, could the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post be found. The post alleges that it comes from \u201cAlice In Wonderland,\u201d but a keyword search of the 1951 and 2010 film adaptations with that name turned up no matches, and neither did the sequel to the 2010 movie.\n\n\u201cDefinitely not by Lewis Carroll,\u201d said Edward Wakeling, a former chairman of the Lewis Carroll Society, in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nThe DCNF found an exact match for the quote in an episode of the ABC television series \u201cOnce Upon A Time\u201d through an internet search. The show, which aired from 2011 to 2018, pulled characters and plot elements from popular fairy tales, including some of Carroll\u2019s works.\n\nJefferson, a character based on the Hatter in Carroll\u2019s \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland,\u201d says the following lines in episode 17 of season one: \u201cYou know what the issue is with this world? Everyone wants some magical solution to their problem, and everyone refuses to believe in magic.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible this allusion to Carroll\u2019s work may have led some to believe the line about magic in the episode was from Carroll.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
