It is now clear that the whole world has been attacking the so-called coronavirus pandemic wrongly due to a serious pathophysiological diagnosis error,\" the lengthy post begins.\n\nAutopsies performed by Italian pathologists, the post continues, show that COVID-19 \"is not pneumonia, but it is disseminated intravascular coagulation, or thrombosis, which ought to be fought with antibiotics, antivirals, anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants. If this is true for all cases, that means the whole world is about to resolve this novel pandemic earlier than expected.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

They concluded that \"the virus remains in lung tissue for many days, even if in small quantities, possibly being the trigger of the mechanism that leads to and feeds lung damage.\"\n\nTheir findings were posted in a preliminary study April 19. That study has not been peer reviewed, meaning it has not yet been evaluated by experts for formal publication in a medical journal.\n\nOne of the pathologists on the study, Dr. Aurelio Sonzogni of Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, confirmed to PolitiFact that the study does not contradict the fact that COVID-19 is a virus that cannot be treated with antibiotics. Rather, his study found that lung damage caused by blood clots is one possible effect of COVID-19. The study has been accepted for publication in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, a London-based medical journal, he said.\n\n\"Autopsies prove that COVID-19 is\" a blood clot, not pneumonia, \"and ought to be fought with antibiotics,\" a Facebook post claimed,\" and the whole world has been wrong in treating the \"so-called\" pandemic.\n\nThe novel coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19 is a virus. Viruses do not respond to antibiotic treatment; antibiotics only work on bacterial infections.\n\n \n\n COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory illness that in some cases causes pneumonia. Another effect, according to the autopsies in Italy, is lung damage caused by blood clotting.\n\nThe post is false and ridiculous \u2014 Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
