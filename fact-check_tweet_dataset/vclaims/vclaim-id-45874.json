Mostly no, although some points are true and others are just predictions that cannot be fact checked.\n\nAn example of the massive meme is found in a post (archived here) shared on Facebook June 4, 2020. It opened:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post's claims. For the remainder of the post, which attempts to explain its reasoning, read to the bottom for the second-part screenshot:\n\nIt's a long list, so we'll take it one by one:\n\nNo, this is not true considering, at the time of the post -- June 4 -- most economies in the United States and globally had started reopening through phased plans that allow various industries, including restaurants and office buildings, to start resuming business. Also, there is no evidence that, at any point during the COVID-19 pandemic, the \"entire world\" was in lockdown. There are reports, in fact, that the lockdowns saved perhaps millions of lives.\n\nWhile it is true that Harry and Megan left their royal duties to pursue a more independent life, the second part about the Royal Family being \"satan worshipping, child traffickers\" is backed by no evidence. The Royal Family have been known to practice the Christian faith in the Anglican Church. In fact, Queen Elizabeth II is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England.\n\nA popular D.C. pizzeria and a number of surrounding businesses are being inundated with death threats because of a mushrooming online conspiracy theory accusing them of being at the center of an international child trafficking ring tied to Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, satanism, and punk bands. How did this happen? As what's being called Pizzagate shows, when the right conditions are present, the web can be used to perpetuate wildly irresponsible nonsense that has very real world effects. The theory of the Pizzagate true believers is a work in progress, but the gist is that close allies of Hillary Clinton are using secret areas of Chevy Chase's Comet Ping Pong to rape children as part of a broader child trafficking operation in which \"pizza\" is used as code for kids. It first appeared on the politics message board of 4chan, a hive of internet trolling, metastasized on the biggest pro-Donald Trump subreddit, served as a convenient distraction for institutions loyal to Turkish President Recep Erdogan, and is now percolating on forums across the internet, as self-identified \"investigators\" comb the web for further clues. In the process, the frenzied pedo-truthers have published the personal information of numerous private citizens and bombarded their social media accounts, homes, and places of business with graphic threats.\"\n\nBut there is no proof to back up the suggestion that \"Pizzagate\" is reality.", "lang": "en"}
