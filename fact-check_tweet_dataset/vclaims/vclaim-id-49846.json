Ferdinand Marcos\u2019s last will and testament -- give \u201c90 percent of his wealth\u201d to the \u201cpeople of the Philippines.\u201d\n\nMaharlika atin toh points to two materials as basis for its unfounded claim: the late strongman\u2019s will and a 2013 television interview of his wife, former first lady Imelda Marcos. The nine-minute video, which has already been viewed over a million times, was uploaded the day after Imelda\u2019s 91st birthday on July 2.\n\nNo evidence presented in the video, or any government documents, support the extravagant claim.\n\nFirst, the late strongman, his family and cronies accumulated ill-gotten wealth during his two-decade presidency, according to the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG), the agency created to investigate and recover the ill-gotten wealth. It estimates the value to be between USD 5 and 10 billion. Since 1986, the PCGG has recovered almost USD 4 billion. Hundreds of cases against the Marcoses and their cronies remain pending in various courts.\n\nSecond, only a portion of Marcos\u2019s last will and testament was made public in November 2016 to serve as proof that he wanted to be buried in the Libingan ng mga Bayani (Heroes\u2019 Cemetery), as it is \u201caccording to the rites established by law and with dignity suitable to [his] position.\u201d\n\nThere was no section in the revealed portion of the document stating that the people of the Philippines are the \u201conly beneficiary\u201d of \u201c90 percent\u201d of his wealth, contrary to the claim in the clip.\n\nThird, Imelda was interviewed by veteran journalist Mel Tiangco in July 2013 for her program on GMA7. While showing Tiangco a room full of documents related to various court cases she has been involved in, the Marcos matriarch said her family\u2019s wealth is \u201cthe reason why [she] wanted to survive,\u201d as it \u201cwill save the world.\u201d\n\nShe is willing to give an amount of their wealth \u201cnot only [to] the Philippines\u201d but to \u201cthe world.\u201d\n\nIn August 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte said the Marcoses are \u201copen\u201d to \u201creturn a few gold bars\u201d to help the government in its deficit spending. Imelda earlier claimed the gold bars did not come from the government. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Duterte and Imelda tell contradicting stories about Marcos gold)\n\nThere have been no reports since then of any gold bar being surrendered to the government.\n\nMaharlika atin toh\u2019s viral video with more than 38,000 reactions, 4,700 comments, and 48,000 shares was also re-uploaded on Youtube by channel Perlas ng Silangan four days later.", "lang": "en"}
