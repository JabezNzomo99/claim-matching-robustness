There, it contains a headline on Padilla's death. It also contains a \"Trending News\" name and logo, yet some of the links cited GMA News in the headline. Some also misspelled Padilla's name.\n\nThe pages also embedded a video with the 24 Oras logo in the thumbnail. Once clicked, it plays for a few seconds before prompting the viewer to share the video before continuing to watch it.\n\nThe facts: Padilla is alive and has been active on social media platforms. The link to the embedded video on the websites leads to a GMA News report on a shooting incident of a different woman.\n\nGMA reported that the woman who was shot in her car was identified as a certain Consuelo Go. The video was uploaded on January 26, 2019.\n\nThe claim was being circulated as early as July 4, but Padilla has been active on her verified accounts since then. She posted on Instagram on July 6 and was retweeting posts on Twitter on July 7.\n\nSocial media monitoring tool CrowdTangle also revealed that the randomnames.club link has been shared since March, but with a different headline which said that P20,000 will be provided to all SSS members due to COVID-19. This claim was also debunked by Rappler.\n\nThis method of perpetuating death hoaxes has been used for several claims in the past that were also debunked by Rappler, including those of Piolo Pascual and Dwayne Johnson. \u2013 Loreben Tuquero/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
