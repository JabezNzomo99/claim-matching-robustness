{"title": "No, BJP MLA Raja Singh's Sister Did Not Convert To Islam", "subtitle": "The post uses photos of a Kerala woman to falsely claim that Raja Singh's sister has converted to Islam.", "author": "www.boomlive.in", "date": "2019-06-07T16:54:32+05:30", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-22921", "url": "https://www.boomlive.in/no-bjp-mla-raja-singhs-sister-did-not-convert-to-islam/", "vclaim": "A screenshot purporting to show an article by The News Minute claiming Bharatiya Janata Party MLA from Hyderabad - Raja Singh's sister converted to Islam, is fake.\n\nBOOM contacted Raja Singh who denied the claim in the viral post.\n\n\"I have eight sisters and none of them have converted to Islam. The post is fake,\" Raja Singh, BJP MLA from Hyderabad told BOOM.\n\nThe screenshot has used an image of a woman with and without a Hijab. It has also used an image of Raja Singh in the inset. The screenshot has been morphed to look like a web article by The News Minute. However, the fonts used are a giveaway that the image is fake.\n\nThe photoshopped text on the screenshot says, \"Hyderabad BJP MLA Raja Singh's sister Maya Devi accepted Islam. Said, \"India is a democratic country choosing religion is our personal right, no one can force. \"\n\nIt then goes on to state \"I don't hate any other religions nor I support any political party. I believe in humanity. My parents always supported me in every decision. My brother separated from us for these reasons.\"\n\nA reverse image search of the two photos led us to an article published by The News Minute on July 31, 2017 from Kerala. The story titled, 'Missing Kerala Hindu Girl converts to Islam; goes back to parents on HC assurance' has the same photos as the fake post and identifies the woman as Athira alias Aysha from Kasargod district in Kerala.\n\nAthira had converted out of her own will to Islam, according to the article. According to recent reports, Athira held a press conference claiming she has \"returned to Hinduism\" and given up Islam.\n\nThe fake post comes in light of yet another controversial statement by Singh where he accused Asaduddin Owaisi, leader of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) of \"funding terrorists\".\n\nSingh who is a BJP MLA from Hyderabad, Telangana has in the past made headlines for his anti-Islam comments. He had earlier criticised a police officer of Hyderabad for wearing a skull cap.", "lang": "en"}
