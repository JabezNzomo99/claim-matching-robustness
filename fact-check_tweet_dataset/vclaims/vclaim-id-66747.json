Opponents claim many charters don\u2019t measure up to those promised achievements, and strain municipal budgets.\n\nThe issue arose during a July 10, 2014, \"State of the State Debate\" between two of the three Democratic candidates for lieutenant governor: Secretary of State A. Ralph Mollis and Cumberland Mayor Daniel J. McKee. (State Rep. Frank Ferri, also a candidate, did not participate.)\n\nThe focus: The Blackstone Valley Prep Mayoral Academy. McKee is the current chairman of the academy\u2019s board.\n\nMollis, a charter school skeptic, focused on costs, saying, \"The per-pupil cost at the mayoral academy far outweighs the per-pupil costs in Cumberland public schools.\"\n\nMollis continued: \"One of the major issues right now is what\u2019s happening in public education -- that we\u2019re not providing enough funds and resources into our public education system, that entities like the mayoral academies are taking money from our public school system \u2026\"\n\nSome background: Charter schools are independently run public schools that are granted greater flexibility in their operations, in return for greater accountability for performance. Mayoral academies are regional charter schools whose boards are chaired by a mayor.\n\nBlackstone Valley Prep was started in 2009 as \"an intentionally diverse\" network of tuition-free public schools. Chartered by the Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE), Blackstone Valley Prep enrolls students from Central Falls, Cumberland, Lincoln and Pawtucket: There are currently some 1,000 students in grades K-8. A high school is set to open in the fall with 100 ninth-grade students.\n\nWe started our fact-checking by looking at RIDE statistics. RIDE reports per-pupil costs for all public schools in the state by adding up total budgets and dividing by the number of students.\n\nIt uses a \"Uniform Chart of Accounts,\" a standardized method by which every district, public charter school and state-operated school tracks revenue and expenses the same way. RIDE says that allows \"for an apples-to-apples comparison between districts.\"\n\nContrary to what Mollis said, RIDE\u2019s figures show that Blackstone Valley\u2019s per-pupil costs were actually LESS than Cumberland\u2019s in fiscal years 2012 and 2013.\n\nHowever, in fiscal years 2010 and 2011, -- the charter\u2019s first two years -- Blackstone Valley\u2019s costs were significantly higher. (The fiscal year runs from July 1 through June 30.)\n\nHere are the numbers:\n\nRIDE spokesman Elliot Krieger said the costs are \"equalized,\" by subtracting capital costs and debt service from those who report it through the school budget - \"the only fair way to compare districts.\"\n\nKrieger says, \"Our pupil expenditure data does not support that [Mollis\u2019] statement.\"\n\nThat seems pretty straightforward, right?\n\nBut when we asked the Mollis campaign to back up his statement, campaign manager Nicholas Cicchitelli directed us to RIDE \"revenue-per-pupil\" figures - not cost-per-pupil - as \"black-and-white support\" for Mollis\u2019 claim.\n\nCicchitelli said that\u2019s a more valid figure to use because it \"shows how much money taxpayers are actually paying per pupil to the Mayoral Academy vs. what they pay to Cumberland public schools per pupil.\"\n\nFirst, in the debate, Mollis said \"cost per pupil,\" not \"revenue per pupil.\"\n\nAnd second, revenues are actually \"money coming in,\" versus expenditures - which is money spent. The revenue is from all sources - local, state, federal, and \u2018other,\u2019 such as grants and donations, says Krieger.(In May, for example, BV Prep received a $450,000 grant from Next Generation Learning Challenges to launch its high school this fall).\n\nCicchitelli also said that Mollis did not use the term \"per pupil expenditure\" because RIDE \"includes some things and excludes others which distorts the true cost. For example, debt service is manipulated \u2026 \"\n\nSeeking clarity, we contacted the Cumberland School District. Alexander Prignano, district business manager, offered this view:\n\n\"The latest RIDE numbers are right,\" he said. \"They do show BV and maybe two others are lower [than Cumberland.] But to say that without looking behind the numbers is misleading.\"\n\nPrignano said per-pupil costs at charter schools are typically lower \"because they don\u2019t have the special ed population that a public school will have, and special ed students are very, very costly to educate.\" Another example: mayoral academies are exempt from the state\u2019s pension system, he said.\n\nWe asked Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council - an independent, nonprofit and nonpartisan public policy research and education organization - to weigh in.\n\nExecutive director John C. Simmons said RIDE provided RIPEC with data for per-pupil expenditures and per-pupil revenue, \"which allowed us to compare the two schools over time.\"\n\n\"We would say you should look at the cost per student as opposed to where the money came from,\" Simmons said. He noted, for example, \"You can get grants and contributions that are not taxpayer money.\"\n\nSimmons also said it\u2019s not surprising that Blackstone Valley\u2019s costs per pupil in its first few years were high because of the expense of starting a new school, spread out among relatively few students -- 76 in the beginning. And it\u2019s not surprising that those costs \"would decline rapidly as the number of students increases.\"\n\nSimmons said, \"It looks like during the first two years of transition, Blackstone spent a considerable amount more [per pupil] than Cumberland did. When you look into the more norming years, Blackstone Valley spent less than Cumberland by a couple hundred dollars.\"\n\nRalph Mollis said: \"The per-pupil cost in the Mayoral Academy [Blackstone Valley] far outweighs the per-pupil cost in Cumberland public schools.\" That\u2019s a pretty sweeping claim.\n\nAnd it\u2019s only true for the school\u2019s first two years, when start-up costs, spread over a relatively small number of students, would be high.\n\nIt\u2019s not true for the more representative last two years, when the Academy\u2019s per-pupil costs were lower, not higher.\n\nThe efforts of the Mollis campaign to consider \"revenue per pupil\" didn\u2019t sway us. It\u2019s not the same thing and it\u2019s not what Mollis said.\n\nBecause Mollis\u2019 statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it .", "lang": "en"}
