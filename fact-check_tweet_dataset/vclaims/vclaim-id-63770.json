He originally posted the photograph to, and then deleted it from, Instagram.\n\nThe image drew immediate criticism from many quarters. Falwell is president of the private, evangelical school Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, where students \u201care told to dress \u2018modestly\u2019 and are banned from consuming media that feature nudity or sexual content.\u201d The photograph prompted U.S. Rep. Mark Walker, R-North Carolina, a former instructor at Liberty, to demand Falwell\u2019s resignation:\n\nFalwell apologized for posting the picture. Speaking to Lynchburg radio station WLNI, he explained how the photograph came about: Describing the woman in the image as his wife\u2019s assistant (he didn\u2019t name her), Falwell said the picture was meant as a joke.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s pregnant, so she couldn\u2019t get her pants zipped,\u201d Falwell said. \u201cI had on a pair of jeans that I haven\u2019t worn in a long time, so I couldn\u2019t get mine zipped either. And so I just put my belly out like hers.\u201d\n\nThe governing board of Liberty University wasn\u2019t laughing at the joke. Falwell agreed to take an \u201cindefinite leave of absence\u201d from his role as university president upon the request of the university\u2019s board.", "lang": "en"}
