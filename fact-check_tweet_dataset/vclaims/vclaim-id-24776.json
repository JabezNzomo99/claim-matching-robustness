The above post has been shared a whopping 34,000 times so far, and viewed in excess of 675,000 times. The video has been re-circulated now, on Facebook and YouTube with the identical claim. On YouTube, the video has been posted with the message in Tamil.\n\nThe uniformed person in the video identifies himself as Sarfaraz Aman from Khwaja Ajmer Nagari thana. Through the video, he informs that this child is very young and cannot even tell her name. He further appeals for the video to be shared, so that it may reach her parents or guardians.\n\nFrom the information available in the video itself, it is apparent that the video pertains not to India, but most likely Pakistan.

Alt News took a frame from the video and reverse-searched it with the information from the video. The result threw up a YouTube link. The video had been posted in December 2018 with the caption, \u2018Missing Child found by Khawaja Ajmer Nagri Police Karachi December 2018\u2019.\n\nAlt News also found posts from December 2018 by Pakistani users, who had uploaded this video with the message in Urdu. In addition, Alt News searched \u2018Khwaja Ajmer Nagari\u2018 on Google Maps, which confirmed that this locality is indeed in Karachi, Sindh. Furthermore, the uniform worn by the policeman does indeed pertain to Sindh, although the Sindh police uniform was changed recently.\n\nIn conclusion, a video from Karachi, Pakistan which appeared online in December 2018, has been shared with the false claim that a Tamil girl child was found at the Nagpur railway station.", "lang": "en"}
