But Mexicans have turned Trump\u2019s wall into a tourist attraction & are playing a game to see who can climb it the fastest, no ladders or ropes needed. The record is 45 seconds.\u201d\n\nThat tweet was shared by the comedian Patton Oswalt and thousands of others.\n\n@Howroute also alluded to Trump\u2019s September 2019 boasts about the wall, posting a video clip of two young men scaling a fence along with the text \u201cTrump\u2019s fancy border fence\u2026\u201d while another user joined in, adding \u201cBut \u2026 he said that you could \u2018fry an egg.'\u201d\n\nYet another user posted video footage of Trump declaring, \u201cThis wall can\u2019t be climbed,\u201d next to the same footage of young men scaling a fence:\n\nIn reality, the footage and images used to lampoon Trump\u2019s claims showed completely different stretches of border fencing from the one the president showed off to the press in September 2019, and the video footage was captured three years earlier, before Trump\u2019s election as president.\n\nTrump made the boasts in question while holding a press conference on Sept. 18, at a section of under-construction border fencing at Otay Mesa, California. He claimed that, in order to test the structure\u2019s resistance, the administration had invited 20 \u201cworld-class mountain-climbers\u201d to attempt to scale various border-fence prototypes. \u201cThis was the one that was hardest to climb,\u201d Trump said, gesturing toward the fence. He continued:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all seen the pictures of young people climbing walls with drugs on their back. A lot of drugs, they\u2019re unbelievable climbers. This wall can\u2019t be climbed. This is very, very hard. What the panel does on top, as I said, is structural, but it\u2019s also very hard to get by that panel. Plus, it\u2019s designed to absorb heat. So it\u2019s extremely hot. The wall is \u2014 you won\u2019t be able to touch it, you can fry an egg on that wall. It\u2019s very, very hot. So if they\u2019re going to climb it, they\u2019re going to have to bring hoses and water and we don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going to hook it up because there\u2019s not a lot of water out here. So it\u2019s a very, very hard thing to climb.\u201d\n\nSignificant and substantive doubts have been raised about the veracity of Trump\u2019s claim that preparations for the construction of the border involved 20 \u201cworld-class mountain-climbers\u201d testing various fence models, and the White House did not respond to our request for clarification.\n\nNotwithstanding that factual uncertainty, it\u2019s clear that Trump\u2019s Sept. 18 boasts were specifically about the new model of border fence being erected along the southern border in 2019, in particular the section at Otay Mesa, next to which the press conference took place.\n\nBy contrast, the video footage and still images used to contradict and ridicule the president\u2019s claim that \u201cthis wall can\u2019t be climbed\u201d were either captured in 2016, before construction began on Trump\u2019s long-promised border fence, and even before he became president, or at a section of fencing that is clearly, visibly different from the one the president showed off in September 2019.\n\nThe video footage that showed two young men quickly scaling a fence, with backpacks that may have contained drugs, was captured in March 2016, at a section of border fencing near Nogales, Arizona. The video was shot by a news crew from the Mexican television channel Azteca Trece (now known as Azteca Uno), and can be viewed below:\n\nTrump appeared to reference this very video in his September 2019 remarks, saying \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen the pictures of young people climbing walls with drugs on their back. \u2026 This wall can\u2019t be climbed.\u201d So the president was saying that the wall next to him, at Otay Mesa, could not be climbed, unlike the type of wall seen in the March 2016 video footage. It is therefore particularly disingenuous for online commentators to use that very footage to undermine or ridicule Trump\u2019s claims.\n\nThe two fence models bore certain similarities, but did appear to have significant differences. In particular, the fence climbed in a matter of seconds at Nogales, in March 2016, visibly did not have a panel at the top (as the newer model does) \u2014 a feature that might well have prevented the young men from surmounting the fence and making their descent on the other side.\n\nThe graphic below shows the top of the fence climbed in March 2016, on the left, and the top of the fence that the president said \u201ccan\u2019t be climbed,\u201d in September 2019:\n\nIn a September tweet, @stonecold2050 used a still image of several men climbing a fence in order to illustrate the claim that, contrary to the president\u2019s assertions, \u201cMexicans have turned Trump\u2019s wall into a tourist attraction and are playing a game to see who can climb it the fastest.\u201d\n\n\n\n However, that image did not show the specific model of fence the president described as a \u201cvery, very hard thing to climb.\u201d Rather, it showed a stretch of fencing at San Ysidro, California, captured by NBC News in November 2018:\n\nThe San Ysidro fence was clearly different from the one unveiled by Trump in September 2019. It appeared to be considerably shorter, and it also lacked the paneling present at the top of the Otay Mesa fence, as shown in the graphic below:\n\nOverall, the social media posts that endeavored to ridicule or undermine Trump\u2019s boasts about the new model of border fencing at Otay Mesa were grossly misleading, because they used video and still images taken from other fences at other locations and at earlier dates, and those fences had significant and substantive structural differences from the fencing unveiled in September 2019.\n\nPosts that used video footage of two young men scaling a border fence in March 2016 were especially disingenuous, because Trump himself specifically contrasted the integrity of the fencing seen in that footage with the newer model of fencing that he showed off to the media in September 2019.", "lang": "en"}
