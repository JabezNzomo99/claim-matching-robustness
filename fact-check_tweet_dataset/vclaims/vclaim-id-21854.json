Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim 1: Modi: \u201cI am the son of a Pathan. I speak and do truthful things.\u201d Fact: The video posted on Facebook is clipped. In the full video, Modi claims that Imran Khan has said, \u201cI am the son of a Pathan. I speak and do truthful things.\u201d Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nWhen the video posted on Facebook is divided into frames using Invid tool and the frames are searched on Google Reverse Image Search, it can be found the video was taken from the Modi\u2019s speech at a public meeting in Tonk, Rajasthan on 23rd February, 2019. When searched for \u2018Modi\u2019s speech at Tonk, Rajasthan\u201d, the full version of the video can be found on the BJP\u2019s Official YouTube channel. At 1:01:02 seconds in the video, it can be observed that Modi says the exact sentences posted on Facebook. But before that, he says that Imran Khan told him so. Hence, the original video has been clipped selectively to mislead the people.\n\nTo sum it up, Modi in his Rajasthan speech said that Imran Khan said to him. \u201cI am the son of a Pathan\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
