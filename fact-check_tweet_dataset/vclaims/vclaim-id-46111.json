Let\u2019s analyze the authenticity of the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Video of a Muslim man spitting into the food packages to spread coronavirus. Fact: It\u2019s an old video. While the coronavirus outbreak was reported in China in December 2019, the posted video has been shared on the internet since April 2019. Also, the video is not related to India. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nUpon reverse image search of the screenshots of the posted video, it was found that the video was present on the internet since April 2019. A Facebook page, \u2018We are Malaysians\u2019 posted the same video on 26 April 2019 with the words: \u2018Secret Recipe\u2026 to keep papadum fresh always. Turns out this is the secret recipe to stay fresh forever\u2019. No additional information related to the video was found in the post.\n\n\n\nIn the posted video, the logo of the food delivery organisation, \u2018foodpanda\u2019, is in pink color. However, in India, the logo of \u2018foodpanda\u2019 is in orange color. Therefore, the posted video is not related to India. Although people on social media have been mentioning that the video is related to Malaysia, no information related to it was found. It can be seen from the \u2018foodpanda\u2019 website that the logo color of their organisation in Malaysia is \u2018pink\u2018.\n\n\n\nAlso, while the coronavirus outbreak was reported in China in the last week of December 2019, the posted video was present on the internet since April 2019. \n\n\n\nTo summarize, an old video from Malaysia is falsely shared as that of a Muslim man spitting in food to spread Coronavirus\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
