If my dad were washing dishes today, the odds are very, very high he would have lost his job because of the crushing taxes and regulations that are hammering small business. Two-thirds of all new jobs come from small businesses. If my dad hadn\u2019t lost his job, the odds are overwhelming he would have had his hours forcibly reduced to 28 or 29 hours a week because the threshold for Obamacare is 30 hours a week. And, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to pay his way through the University of Texas at 29 hours a week. He wouldn\u2019t have been able to feed his kid at 29 hours a week. And if he doesn\u2019t have that first job washing dishes, he doesn\u2019t get his second job working as a cook. Which means he doesn\u2019t get his third job as a teaching assistant, which means he doesn\u2019t get his fourth job as a computer programmer at IBM. We need to be focusing on how policies impact those who are struggling, and every policy we think about and talk about should make it easier for those who are struggling to climb up the economic ladder and achieve the American Dream.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a response to a common claim by liberals that Republicans only care about defending the wealthy,\u201d Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said. \u201cThe senator\u2019s point is that the core of Republican principles are not about propping up the wealthy, but about helping the little guy \u2014 not through a government handout, but through empowering those with less to climb up the economic ladder one rung at a time. That is accomplished by scaling back big government, keeping power with local and state governments so that the private sector can thrive.\u201d\n\n\u201cOverall, if you look at the full century of evidence, the rich do better under Republicans (or least Republicans put in place deregulation+less progressive taxation that allow the rich to thrive later on),\u201d Saez said in an e-mail. \u201cThat said, there are exceptions. Since 2009, the recovery has been skewed dramatically toward the rich. Obama\u2019s policies most likely to affect the income gap (higher taxes on the rich, financial regulations, Obamacare) don\u2019t kick in till 2013 or 2014 so you can\u2019t blame those here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the data support the view that Republican presidents have tended to do much better (with respect to income growth) for affluent families than for middle-class or (especially) poor families,\u201d he said. The second chart was provided, he said, because \u201csome people argue that the parties (and/or the American economy) in the post-Reagan era are significantly different than they were in the first half of the post-war era.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a lie to call Republicans the party of the rich because conservative policies are explicitly designed to help the poor climb up the economic ladder. The Democrats, on the other hand, are directly responsible for exacerbating income inequality in this country with policies that keep the rich rich and keep the poor poor. Look no further than the strong economic recovery under Reagan, a conservative Republican, versus President Obama, a liberal Democrat. Under President Obama\u2019s so\u2013called \u2018recovery,\u2019 median American household income has fallen by $2,380 or 4.4 percent, after having fallen by 1.8 percent during the recession, and there is a 4.5 million jobs gap between the Obama recovery and the average post-1960 average recovery. Under Reagan\u2019s recovery, household median income rose 2.1 percent by the end of his first term and grew for every demographic category for the rest of his presidency. Also, over the same comparable period, a Reagan Recovery would have produced 7 million more jobs It\u2019s a shame that rather than expressing any curiosity about the liberal policies that are directly killing jobs, opportunities, and promoting inequality in this country, this so-called fact-check seems committed to perpetuating a false myth created by the Democrats purely for political gain.\n\nBut, without more evidence, Cruz simply can\u2019t pair it with a sweeping statement that saying Republicans are the party of the rich is \u201cthe biggest lie\u201d when decades of economic data show the poor do better under Democrats, that the rich tend to vote Republican and that most Americans believe Republican policies favor the rich. We note that he never makes an affirmative case for why Republicans are not the party of the rich; he simply knocks Democrats. (We have not fact checked the data provided by Cruz\u2019s staff in the updated comment, but a discrete comparison between Reagan and Obama, while ignoring the records of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, appears too narrow when comparing Democrats and Republicans.)", "lang": "en"}
