The video, entitled \u201cCatalina and Madeline,\u201d featured two sisters from Chicago discussing their support of U.S. President Donald Trump and their fear about the potential of violent protests in Democratic nominee Joe \u201cBiden\u2019s America\u201d:\n\nAround the four-minute mark of the above-displayed video, clips showing fires and protests start appearing on the screen as one of the women says: \u201cThis is a taste of Biden\u2019s America. The riot, the crime. Freedom is at stake now. This is going to be the most important election of our lifetime.\u201d\n\nAlthough some of the clips in this segment truly show protests that took place in America after the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in police custody (arguably, those protests took place in \u201cTrump\u2019s America,\u201d not Biden\u2019s, since Trump has been serving as the President of the United States since January 2017), one of the clips comes from an entirely different country.\n\nAt the 4:15 mark, an image of a large fire on a street appears (shown in the screenshot at the top of this article).\n\nThis scene was not filmed in the United States. The above-displayed fire actually occurred in October 2019 in Barcelona, Spain. CCMA, a news outlet from Catalonia, was the first to highlight the mistake.\n\nThis footage is available via Shutterstock where it is presented with the caption: \u201cYoung rebel riot revolutionary anarchist stands on trash and fire showing fuck as protest for independence on demonstration about the proces[s] and political prisoners Demonstrator burns garbage bins in.\u201d\n\nWhile the Shutterstock caption does not identify the location of the video, Buzzfeed News noted that footage of the same fire is available via Getty Images along with a caption identifying the location of the chaotic scene:", "lang": "en"}
