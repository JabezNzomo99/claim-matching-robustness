They also indicate that overall police pay has fallen in real terms since 2010.\n\nThis data isn\u2019t publicly available, so we haven\u2019t yet been able to verify it.\n\nThe calculation leading to the 32% figure appears to come from Downing Street itself, with a source from Number 10 explaining this afternoon how the figures were reached.\n\nA new police officer starting service in September 2010 would have been paid \u00a323,259 on the lowest pay point. When you take off income tax and national insurance contributions from that, you get to just under \u00a318,000 take-home pay.\n\nAll police officers move up a salary scale, usually automatically after each year\u2019s service. That same officer, if still in post, would now be earning around \u00a335,478, according to Downing Street (the published figures are slightly different, but similar).\n\nAgain, after tax, that looks more like \u00a327,400 to take home today. This tax, Number 10 is keen to stress, is made less than it would otherwise have been by the government\u2019s increases to the income tax personal allowance since 2010.\n\nThat change from \u00a318,000 to \u00a327,400 is the \u00a39,000 Theresa May is talking about, and that amounts to a roughly 33% increase when you factor in price inflation.\n\nSo we can\u2019t fault the maths, but the context is another matter.\n\nNot the experience of most officers?\n\nWe already know that police officer numbers have fallen significantly since 2010, so it\u2019s unclear how representative this example officer\u2019s experience has been.\n\nThe Police Federation was scathing in its own remarks shortly after the Prime Minister made her claim.\n\nIt told us that Mrs May\u2019s comments weren\u2019t representative of the experience of most officers. Instead it offered an alternative: the total pay of officers has fallen by 16% in real terms (counting inflation) when comparing 2009/10 with the same pay in 2015/16.\n\nAccording to the Federation, more than half of police officers are already at the top of the pay scale\u2014so don\u2019t benefit from further pay progression.\n\nThe figures they quoted to us come from a census of police hours and pay, which isn\u2019t publicly available. So, for now, we can\u2019t verify the claims for certain.", "lang": "en"}
