Russian media published the photos despite the fact that the meeting was closed to the press.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "May 16, 2017", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-2063", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-mfa-white-house-meeting-pothographs-/28491726.html", "vclaim": "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, in answering questions about whether the Russian reporter violated diplomatic protocol by \u201cleaking\u201d to Russian media the photographs he took at the May 10 meeting with the American president, cited the White House website, claiming \u201cthe White House has explained that there was no scandal concerning this.\u201d\n\nPrincipal Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders addressed the issue during the daily White House press briefing on May 11, the day after President Trump\u2019s meeting with Russian diplomats.\n\nShe said that the \u201cproper protocol\u201d for a meeting between the president and a foreign minister or head of state was followed.\n\n\u201cBoth individuals had official photographers in the room,\u201d Sanders said.\u201cWe had an official photographer in the room, as did they.\u201d\n\nA transcript of the press briefing was posted on the White House website.\n\nHowever, a Polygraph.info fact check found that the Russian Foreign Ministry did not bring an official photographer into the White House, as protocol requires. Instead, in a clear violation of diplomatic protocol, the Russian Foreign Ministry brought a professional photojournalist \u2013 Alexander Scherbak, an employee of Russia\u2019s TASS state news agency.\n\nU.S. media, who were under the impression that Scherbak was not a reporter, but an official Kremlin photographer, accused him of violating professional ethics by \u201cleaking\u201d the pictures to the TASS news agency.\n\nScherbak responded to the accusations in a statement on his Facebook page: \u201cUnder a cooperation agreement between the Foreign Ministry and the TASS news agency, I make a portion of photos available to the Foreign Ministry to post for free on its official webpage\u2026 while some of the photos go to our news agency, TASS.\u201d\n\nIn fact, it was not TASS news agency that first posted photos from the White House meeting, but instead the Russian Foreign Ministry, on its official Twitter account.\n\nThus, there is no information on the White House website \u201cexplaining\u201d that there was \u201cno scandal\u201d concerning the photographs from President Trump\u2019s meeting with the Russian diplomats, as Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov put it. Moreover, Polygraph.info's fact check found that the Russian Foreign Ministry initially violated diplomatic protocol by bringing a Russian photojournalist, rather than an official photographer, into a White House meeting closed to the press.", "lang": "en"}
