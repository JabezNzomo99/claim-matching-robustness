The Ugandan government has reacted to it.\n\nOn August 15, a Facebook user posted on her wall with an accompanying picture to the claim that new babies somewhere in a Nigerian hospital in the South-South were laid on plastic chairs due to insufficient bed.\n\nHer post reads: No more beds for the new babies somewhere in a Nigerian hospital in the SS!!! Where is the 13% derivation???\n\nMeanwhile\u2026 the governor of this state will be proud to be a governor\n\nAnd they will go abroad for every little thing including foreign investments. See the babies in that state.\n\nThe post which gathered 51 likes, 28 comments and 26 shares does not end there, as another Facebook user, who referenced the earlier poster, also claimed that the photo shot was taken in a Nigerian hospital, somewhere in the South-South geo-political zone.\n\nThis is put simply despicable. Imagine that there are no baby cots for these new born babies. The end result is that plastic chairs are shamefully being improvised in place of baby cots.\n\nUnconfirmed reports say this shot was taken in a Nigerian hospital somewhere in the South-South geo-political zone.\n\nQuestion is, where is the \u201813% Derivation Find\u2019?\n\nAlso, on August 17, the claim was posted with the same accompanying picture on the front page of Nairaland, a popular online news platform in Nigeria, with the headline: \u201cNewborn Babies Sleep On Plastic Chairs Due To Insufficient Beds At A Clinic\u201d. Some other Nigerian blogs like Naijaloaded, irfanrashid, praizenews and abujareporters also published this claim on their platforms.\n\nHowever, our findings show that photo of the newborn babies laid on plastic chairs was actually not from any Nigerian hospital but from Kawempe National Referral Hospital, Uganda and the Ugandan government has reacted through the Ugandan Ministry of Health.\n\nAlthough the picture is TRUE as the picture emanated from Kawempe National Referral Hospital, Uganda, the claim is nonetheless FALSE, because it did not happen in any Nigerian hospital. We advise that any information that has not been reported by various notable print or electronic media in Nigeria should be consumed with scepticism.\n\nThis fact-check was done by a Dubawa Fact-checking Fellow in collaboration with The Tribune Online, the online publication of the oldest surviving newsroom in Nigeria.
