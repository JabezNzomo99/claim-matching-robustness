BJP wants illiterate, weak, bare bodied, hungry, poor and slave sycophants -translated)\u201d This is quote ascribed to former Union Minister Arun Shourie by Facebook page, Viral In India. It has garnered close to 8600 shares and 4700 likes.\n\nIn a conversation with Alt News, Arun Shourie has denied having made any statement to this effect. He added, \u201cNeither do I have a social media account including Facebook and Twitter nor do I own a website\u201d.\n\nSeveral other social media users have shared the same claim without any attribution which clearly indicates that a random statement has been ascribed to Arun Shourie to garner shares and run a political propaganda in the run up to the election.\n\nIn the past as well, fake quotes have been ascribed to politicians and public figures resulting in serious ramifications. Viral In India is owned and managed by Abhishek Mishra, who claims to be a \u2018News/Media personality\u2019 and an \u2018RTI activist\u2019 in his Twitter bio.", "lang": "en"}
