Michael Bennet of pushing to \"bring terrorists\" to a Colorado prison.\n\nNo one's banged the drum louder against Bennet than Jon Keyser, who's among more than a dozen GOP candidates vying to claim Bennet's Senate seat in the November general election.\n\n\"We have about 90 terrorists that are left at Guantanamo Bay. Michael Bennet wants to close Guantanamo Bay with the president, and bring them right here to Colorado,\" Keyser said at a Feb. 11 GOP Senate candidates' forum at the University of Denver.\n\nKeyser and his campaign have made similar statements at other campaign stops, in news releases and on social media.\n\nWe looked at Bennet\u2019s record over the years on the Guantanamo Bay prison -- informally called \"Gitmo\" -- for evidence that he advocated bringing suspected terrorists to Colorado.\n\nSince 2009, Bennet has backed Obama's plan to close the Guantanamo Bay prison, : \"I do support the closure because I think it is an important signal to the rest of the world about our devotion to the rule of law.\"\n\nThe United States has faced international criticism about the treatment of prisoners at Gitmo, and some Western countries have said the accused terrorists should be granted prisoner of war protections under the Geneva Conventions.\n\nHowever, Bennet has placed conditions on his support for relocating Gitmo detainees from the start. He said they are being tried in military tribunals, so if they are moved to the United States, they should be held in a military prison. He also has pressed the administration to provide a plan on relocating detainees and consult with local and state officials before prisoners are moved.\n\n\"President Obama and his administration owe the American people a much more detailed plan of what they are going to do with the detainees,\" Bennet said in 2009.\n\nColorado doesn't have a military prison, and Bennet opposes housing detainees in the state\u2019s civilian prisons, including the U.S. Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Florence -- known as ADX or \"supermax\" -- the highest-security federal prison in the country.\n\nIn May 2009, Obama pledged to close the Guantanamo prison by January 2010. The move, without a plan of where the prisoners would be relocated, irked congressional lawmakers.\n\nOn May 20, 2009, Bennet voted with fellow senators to reject an effort to spend $80 million to close the Guantanamo Bay prison and to relocate the terrorism suspects, possibly to U.S. prisons.\n\nBut an amendment Bennet backed to prohibit funding to transfer Gitmo detainees to the United States was stripped out of the bill by a conference committee that irons out legislative language differences between Senate and House bills. Bennet did not serve on that committee.\n\nA freshman senator, Bennet got into a dust-up during the 2009 debate with senior California Sen. Dianne Feinstein -- a fellow Democrat -- who said in a floor speech that Colorado\u2019s supermax prison would be a perfect home for Gitmo detainees. \"This facility houses not only drug kingpins, serial murderers and gang leaders, but also terrorists who have already been convicted of crimes in this country,\" .\n\nBennet disagreed in a , saying, \"I strongly support the Senate's decision to withhold funding for the transfer of the detainees until the Administration comes up with a plan for the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. Because the detainees are being tried by military tribunals, they should be held in military facilities. Military detainees should not be transported to and held at Supermax because it is not a military facility.\"\n\nIn the same 2009 bill, calling on the defense secretary to consult with state and local government officials before making any decision about where Guantanamo detainees may be transferred if Gitmo was closed by a presidential executive order.\n\nWe asked the Keyser campaign for evidence supporting the candidate\u2019s claim that Bennet wants to \"bring [terrorists] right here to Colorado.\"\n\nKeyser campaign spokesman Matt Connelly replied that \"Bennet knew that Colorado was at the top of the list\" of U.S. prisons where the Obama administration has considered transferring Gitmo detainees. He cited a 2009 address in which Obama suggested that Supermax could be a potential home for detainees .\n\n\"As we make these decisions, bear in mind the following fact: Nobody has ever escaped from one of our federal supermax prisons, which hold hundreds of convicted terrorists,\" Obama said.\n\nYet, other prisons have also been reported as possible replacements for Gitmo, including military facilities like Fort Leavenworth, Kan., or the U.S. Navy brig in Charleston, S.C.\n\nConnelly said that Bennet has voted against two Republican amendments to ban the transfer of Gitmo detainees to the United States. He also voted against an amendment to block funds to prepare U.S. facilities to house detainees.\n\nConnelly said such votes effectively laid the groundwork for Gitmo detainees to be transferred to the United States, including Colorado. \"It\u2019s laughable that after years of silence, Sen. Bennet is now arguing that he didn\u2019t want to send Gitmo terrorists to Colorado, even though he voted three times to make it happen,\" he said.\n\nLet\u2019s examine the Keyser campaign\u2019s defense of its candidate\u2019s claims.\n\nThey point to Bennet\u2019s 2013 vote against an amendment by Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire that would have prohibited the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo bay to facilities in the United States. Congressional records confirm to the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2014 fiscal year.\n\nBennet spokesman Adam Bozzi said Bennet disagreed with the Ayotte amendment\u2019s requirements about how the Defense Department certifies the security of a foreign government before a Guantanamo detainee could be transferred to that country. Bennet supported another proposal for safeguards on transferring detainees to foreign countries, Bozzi said.\n\nUltimately, for a compromise on Guantanamo, which retained a one-year ban on transferring detainees to the United States while easing the transfer of detainees to foreign countries. It was part of the defense-funding bill that was signed into law.\n\nKeyser\u2019s spokesman added that Bennet also to block funding for transferring Guantanamo detainees to the United States.\n\nBut Bennet\u2019s spokesman counters that the senator voted against the amendment because it would have imposed a permanent ban on funding the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the United States, which . The amendment would have also blocked other Obama administration options, including prosecuting detainees in a federal court in the United States .\n\nGiven that Bennet supports closing Gitmo and potentially moving some detainees to a U.S. military prison, the senator opposed the permanent ban, his spokesman said.\n\nThe permanent domestic-transfer ban amendment and a similar House amendment were left out of the final version of to avoid a threatened White House veto.\n\nBennet instead voted for a one-year ban on transferring detainees to the United States that was included in the 2013 defense-funding bill.\n\nLastly, the Keyser campaign points to to kill a Republican amendment that would have barred the use of funds to construct or modify prisons in the United States or its territories to hold Guantanamo Bay detainees.\n\nBozzi, Bennet\u2019s spokesman, again noted that Bennet, who supports closing Gitmo and moving at least some detainees to a U.S. military prison, of course opposed the amendment that would have blocked construction funding that could be used to prepare a military prison to securely hold the prisoners.\n\n\"I\u2019ve repeatedly said I do not support the transfer of prisoners from the Guantanamo Bay military facility to Colorado,\" Bennet said recently in response to President Obama sending his Guantanamo-closure plan to Congress. \"I\u2019ve voted to close the prison, but I believe military detainees should be held in military prisons. Colorado does not have that type of facility. This plan has done nothing to change my mind. These detainees should not be transferred to Colorado.\"\n\nKeyser said, \"We have about 90 terrorists that are left at Guantanamo Bay. Michael Bennet wants to close Guantanamo Bay with the president, and bring them right here to Colorado.\"\n\nKeyser\u2019s campaign pointed to Bennet\u2019s votes against a permanent ban on transferring detainees to a U.S. military prison and his opposition to blocking construction funding for a prison to hold Gitmo prisoners in the United States.\n\nWhile Bennet has long supported closing the Guantanamo Bay prison, his statements and legislative record show that, since 2009, Bennet has opposed attempts to relocate detainees from Guantanamo to a Colorado prison, including Colorado\u2019s federal supermax prison. Bennet has said repeatedly he thinks detainees should be held in military prisons, and there is no military prison in Colorado.", "lang": "en"}
