No, that's not true: an old study about a compound named AP39 that contains hydrogen sulfide (which also happens to be present in farts) has been presented as if it was about the benefits of smelling farts in several articles that went viral over the years. Unfortunately these articles all smell of bad science reporting, the researchers themselves (Professor Matt Whiteman and Dr. Mark Wood) have denied their study shows any health benefits from inhaling flatulence or any effects on cancer.\n\nThe story recently went viral again via an article published by Rare on April 22, 2019 titled \"Your Husband's Farts Are Actually Helping You Live Longer, According to Science\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nHere we go again, one more study showing me something that I had no intention of knowing, but now I do. Turns out, a new study found that your husbands worst habit, which is farting, duh, may actually increase your lifespan. Yes, his stinky and gross farts are boosting your immune system and have good health benefits. I know, I was shocked too. A study conducted by the University of Exeter research team found that hydrogen sulfide, which is the gross scent that gives flatulence its rotten egg-like quality, can actually have potential health benefits in low doses. Meaning yes, nobody is better at delivering that dose quite like the average hubby.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe article referenced a Reader's Digest article from 2017 that made the same claim:\n\nSorry, But Your Husband's Most Disgusting Habit Is Helping You Live Longer That one particularly awful thing he does? Turns out it could actually be helping your health. Here's the scientific research he's been waiting his whole life for. Shmeliova Natalia/Shutterstock Just about everyone has heard by now that being married is good for your health and longevity, with hitched people having lower rates of high blood pressure risk and even Type 2 diabetes.\n\nThat story in turn relied on this report from Cnet from 2014:\n\nThe title and opening paragraph of that story actually read:\n\nThat story at least points back to the press release from the University of Exeter:\n\nAnd what do we read in the press release, all the way at the end? This:\n\nNote from the study authors: In light of misleading headlines on the above press release, the authors would like to stress that neither the papers (http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2014/MD/C3MD00323J#!divAbstract, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755204, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25960429, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26513708, and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25555533) nor the accompanying press release above make any reference at all to cancer or to any health benefits from inhaling (sniffing) hydrogen sulfide. The research is an early stage drug development project and has not yet been trialled in humans.\n\nThere you have it... we followed the smell of bad science reporting all the way back to the original source and came to one important conclusion: before you report on a study actually take five minutes to look it up and read it so you won't make any fishy claims in your article that give it a weird scent.", "lang": "en"}
