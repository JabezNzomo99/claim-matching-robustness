It\u2019s fake, according to the Thomas Jefferson Foundation. Pictured above that in the meme is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with a quote that says, \u201cI would not look to the U.S. Constitution.\u201d She did say those words, but they are taken out of context.\n\nWhen Ginsburg was being interviewed on an Arabic-language television station in 2012, after protests had unseated Egypt\u2019s government, she suggested that the country look to recently written constitutions as it began writing its own new constitution.\n\nThis is the whole of what she said on the issue during that interview:\n\nRuth Bader Ginsburg, Jan. 30, 2012: You should certainly be aided by all the constitution writing that has gone on since the end of World War II. I would not look to the U.S. Constitution if I were drafting a constitution in the year 2012. I might look at the constitution of South Africa \u2014 that was a deliberate attempt to have a fundamental instrument of government that embraced basic human rights, had an independent judiciary. It really is, I think, a great piece of work that was done. Much more recently than the U.S. Constitution, Canada has the Charter of Rights and Freedoms \u2014 dates from 1982. You would almost certainly look at the European Convention on Human Rights. So, yes, why not take advantage of what there is elsewhere in the world?\n\nBut the Turning Point USA meme plucked out only eight words, which is misleading on its own. Putting that truncated, out-of-context quote next to a fake quote that suggests she was talking about her own work on the Supreme Court is deceptive.\n\nStill, the meme has been shared 48,000 times from Turning Point USA\u2019s Facebook page alone.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cUS SUPREME COURT JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG TO EGYPTIANS: LOOK TO THE CONSTITUTIONS OF SOUTH AFRICA OR CANADA, NOT TO THE US CONSTITUTION.\u201d Al-Hayat TV.
