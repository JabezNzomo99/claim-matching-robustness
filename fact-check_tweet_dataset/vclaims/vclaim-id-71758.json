(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe image is authentic, but it has been altered: The wording on the sign has been changed.\n\nA reverse-image search revealed that the original version of the photograph had one major difference \u2013 instead of \"Women of the Democrat Party,\" the sign actually says \"Lancaster County.\"\n\nThe picture appears in Getty Images stock photos. Its caption doesn\u2019t give an exact date that the photo was taken but does reveal the location:\n\n\"K.K.K. Arrive at Washington. Photo shows women members of the Klan from Lancaster County Pa.\"\n\nThe photo is most likely from one of the large KKK marches on Washington that occurred in the mid-1920s.\n\nTimeline, a historical news website, published an article about the formation of a KKK branch for women. The same photo of the group of women appears in the story, with the caption: \"A contingent of women Ku Klux Klan members from Pennsylvania arrive in Washington D.C. for a march in 1926.\"\n\nA vintage photograph shared on social media shows a group of women KKK members posing with a sign that says \"Women of the Democrat party.\"\n\nWhile the women could have certainly belonged to the Democratic party, the sign\u2019s wording in the photo has been digitally manipulated to link the party to the hate group.", "lang": "en"}
