No, that's not true: the story originated on a South African satire website, it is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by a site named News Updates South Africa on August 12, 2018 titled \"\"When we rename South Africa to Azania, we will require all whites and Indians to reapply for citizenship and adopt African names, else they will be loaded on boats and deported\", Floyd Shivambu - News Updates South Africa\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe EFF second-in-command spoke about the party's controversial stance on Indian South Africans, saying 'some Indians stand with white people and undermine the leadership of African people'. Shivambu addressed the issue of name changes in South Africa, saying he believed 'South Africa' had colonial connotations and should be changed to Azania. \"The name South Africa was an attempt to give direction to the colonial output. We must decide as a country to democratically change the name of the country to Azania,\" he said.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nBut the website posting the news carried following disclaimer on ites about page:\n\nSo you probably shouldn't rely on it for accurate news updates.", "lang": "en"}
