Readers asked Snopes to verify.\n\nShirts emblazoned with the phrase \u201cBlue Lives Murder\u201d can indeed be found and purchased on Amazon. The phrase is a play on \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d Black Lives Matter activists and others across the U.S. have for weeks been protesting the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man who died after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck.\n\nPolice officers and their supporters have sought to counter the Black Lives Matter movement with the phrase \u201cblue lives matter,\u201d which was then co-opted, twisted, and emblazoned on shirts being sold on Amazon. The ones we located on the website were placed there by third-party sellers, however, not by Amazon.\n\nWe sent Amazon a request for comment on the shirts but received no response in time for publication.", "lang": "en"}
