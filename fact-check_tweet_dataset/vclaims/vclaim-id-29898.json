RSS showed its true face, chanted Ambedkar murdabad slogans and burnt the Constitution. They raised Manuvad zindabad slogans.\u201d\n\nThe group of men in the video can be heard chanting, \u201c\u0938\u0902\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093e\u0928 \u092e\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093e\u092c\u093e\u0926 ,\u0906\u0902\u092c\u0947\u0921\u0915\u0930 \u092e\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093e\u092c\u093e\u0926 ,\u0906\u0930\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923 \u092e\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093e\u092c\u093e\u0926 (Constitution murdabad, Ambedkar murdabad, reservation murdabad),\u201d Other slogans that were raised are, \u201c\u0938\u0902\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093e\u0928 \u091c\u0932\u093e\u0913 \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u092c\u091a\u093e\u0913 (Burn the Constitution, save the nation.)\u201d and \u201c\u092e\u0928\u0941\u0935\u093e\u0926 \u091c\u093c\u093f\u0902\u0926\u093e\u092c\u093e\u0926 (manuvad zindabad), SC/ST Act murdabad.\u201d\n\nA keyword search \u201cConstitution burnt\u201d on YouTube took us to the same clip uploaded on August 13, 2018, by the channel \u2018Citizens for Justice and Peace\u2019.\n\n\u201cBurning the Constitution is rejecting democracy and secularism which is what India stands for. An FIR has been lodged by Akhil Bhartiya Bheem Sena against the fringe groups who burned the Constitution in New Delhi on August 10th 2018.The hooligans shouted anti-constitution, anti-Ambedkar and anti-SC/ST slogans while burning the Constitution,\u201d reads its description.\n\nThe incident was widely reported in the media, including NDTV, Hindustan Times, The Hindu and Indian Express. According to Hindustan Times, Anil Tanwar, national in-charge of Akhil Bhartiya Bheem Sena, filed a written complaint with the Delhi police regarding the matter. \u201cThe police team found out two different organisations \u2014 Youth For Equality Foundation (Azad Sena) and Arakshan Virodhi Party \u2014 were holding the protest jointly at Parliament Street. While the Arakshan Virodhi Party was demonstrating under the leadership of Deepak Gaur, the Youth Equality Foundation was headed by one Abhishekh Shukla. After collection of evidence, three different police teams were formed to nab the accused,\u201d the media outlet quotes deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Madhur Verma. Gaur was arrested in Faridabad.\n\nNone of the reports claimed that either organisation is affiliated with the RSS.\n\nA Facebook page \u2018AMU Citizens\u2019 shared the video with the same caption viral on social media.\n\nThe clip is in fact viral on the social networking platform.\n\nAlt News has received multiple verification requests on its official mobile application as well.\n\nA two-year-old video of a group of men burning the Indian Constitution while chanting slogans against B R Ambedkar and the SC/ST Act is viral with the claim that the RSS was involved in the act. The video is currently viral thus giving the impression that the incident is recent. The organisations that were booked by the police were Youth For Equality Foundation (Azad Sena) and Arakshan Virodhi Party.", "lang": "en"}
