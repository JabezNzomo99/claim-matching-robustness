Prior to the voting, he arrested or forced into exile and barred from the ballot his top male political contenders. He now faces competition from three women, led most prominently by Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, 37, who is drawing crowds of thousands while calling out Lukashenko as a \u201cdictator.\u201d Tikhanovskaya\u2019s husband was one of the candidates arrested and forced out.\n\nIn much of his Aug. 4 address, Lukashenko spoke about the country\u2019s security. He argued that Belarus' existence as an independent state is threatened by \u201cmanufactured candidates\u201d (i.e., his opponents) who are the \u201cplywood puppets\u201d of outside powers and \u201cappear out of nowhere, deceive, stage provocations, then sign out back to their masters.\u201d\n\nLukashenko\u2019s campaign has focused on alleged threats from outsiders, especially after July 25, when Belarusian security forces arrested 33 men identified as mercenaries from the Russian security firm PMC Wagner. Citing law enforcement sources, the Belarusian state news agency Belta.by reported that the group was part of a larger deployment of around 200 \u201cwell trained militants, sent to destabilize the situation in Belarus during the election campaign.\u201d\n\nThe agency published a video of the arrests and the personal data of the purported Wagner mercenaries.\n\nThe arrests quickly prompted contradictory theories in media and social networks about what really happened and why. During his Aug. 4 address, Lukashenko dismissed all the explanations other than the government\u2019s as baseless conspiracy theories.\n\n\u201cThese people (they have confessed) were sent specifically to Belarus,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir orders were to wait.\u201d\n\nConsiderable evidence suggests a less-sinister explanation for the arrests. And with the ongoing vote, it suits Lukashenko to appeal to patriotism by spinning the notion that Belarus is under siege.\n\nThe mercenary group, according to officials cited by Belta.by, arrived in the capital Minsk on July 24, and stayed in a hotel for two nights before moving into a sanatorium on the outskirts of the city.\n\nAfter the arrests, the head of Belarus\u2019 security agency accused Russia of interference and claimed the militants were sent to stage \u201cterror attacks\u201d during the election. Lukashenko demanded an explanation from the Kremlin, but the Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the allegations as \u201cnothing but insinuations.\u201d\n\nWagner is a shadowy military and security company, affiliated with Vladimir Putin\u2019s close confidant, financier Yevgeny Prigozhin.\n\nThe United States regards Wagner as a proxy for the Russian military and has sanctioned Prigozhin for Wagner activities that threatened civilians. Prigozhin also was sanctioned, for his role in alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections.\n\nDespite Russian denials, multiple sources independently confirmed the identities and Wagner affiliation of the men on the Belta.by list.\n\nUkraine\u2019s security agency said it had identified at least four of the men as having fought in the Donbas region along the Russian border against Ukraine government forces. Ukraine said it would seek their extradition to be investigated and tried.\n\nZakhar Prilepin, a popular Russian novelist who holds far-right views and fought against Ukraine in Donbas in 2017-2018, wrote via Telegram that \u201cthere really are a few former fighters from our battalion\u201d among those arrested in Minsk.\n\nThe independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, one of the most authoritative sources on Wagner, published detailed dossiers on 16 of the men, including copies of their Russian passports, contracts with Wagner and locations of their deployments.\n\nAlthough the Belarusian authorities claim the men \u201cconfessed,\u201d they did not release other evidence concerning the men\u2019s motives or specific terrorist plans.\n\nMeanwhile, observers have floated other possible explanations for the mercenaries\u2019 arrival in Belarus.\n\nThe leading explanation is that Belarus was never the mercenaries\u2019 target or final destination, but simply a stopover. The theory was pushed by the Telegram channel War Gonzo, which some say has ties to Russian military intelligence.\n\nCiting anonymous Russian intelligence sources, War Gonzo\u2019s Semyon Pegov, a former war correspondent for the Russian tabloid Life, said Wagner \u201chas long been using Minsk as a transit hub\u201d for mercenaries deployed \u201cpredominantly to Africa.\u201d\n\nPegov asserted that the Belarusian security apparatus was on board and provided logistical support to the mercenaries with Lukashenko\u2019s knowledge and approval.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the arrested men only stayed in Minsk because they were late for a flight to Istanbul.\n\nLukashenko said the Istanbul tickets were part of the group\u2019s cover story to conceal the fact that Belarus was the intended destination. Some news accounts in Ukraine and Russia also disputed the transit hub theory.\n\nAnother theory is that Lukashenko plotted with Russian President Vladimir Putin to use the destabilization threat as a way to discredit the opposition and possibly remove his most popular opponent, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, right before the election.\n\nLukashenko denied those allegations. However, Belarusian investigators already have charged Tikhanovskaya\u2019s husband with conspiring with the Russian mercenaries to launch nationwide \u201cdisturbances\u201d during the campaign. Sergei Tikhanovsky, a popular YouTube blogger, was removed from the race and jailed in May on what Lukashenko said was his personal orders.\n\nTikhanovskaya remains on the ballot, but the regime has reportedly increased pressure against the opposition, arresting dozens during peaceful rallies.\n\nLukashenko has a history of playing Russia as both friend and foil.\n\nIn February 2019, Putin invited Lukashenko for three days of talks at the Russian presidential residence in Sochi, on the Black Sea. The reported goal of the meeting was to reach a deal on integrating neighboring Belarus into Russia, but no such integration was ever announced.\n\nSome Belarus watchers said the deployment of Wagner to Minsk could be a message from Putin to Lukashenko signaling that without the former\u2019s support, Russia could become a dangerous adversary.\n\nPutin and Lukashenko discussed the arrests over the phone on Friday. \"The two leaders agreed to determine why the Russians were arrested, find the people responsible and bring them to justice,\" Reuters reported, citing Lukashenko's press office.", "lang": "en"}
