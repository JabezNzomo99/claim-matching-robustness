While this method would certainly make it easier for police to identify the pranksters, users were quick to point out that it would also \u201csacrifice\u201d anyone who pulled the fire alarm in earnest during a real fire.\n\nThankfully, this device didn\u2019t actually lock the alarm puller to the fire alarm. Rather, this piece would detach from the alarm and lock to the person\u2019s wrist, kind of like a big, chunky bracelet, allowing authorities to identify who pulled the alarm after the ordeal was over.\n\nThe above-displayed image was originally published in a 1938 issue of Modern Mechanix. This false-alarm prevention mechanism was also featured in a 1977 documentary called \u201cGizmo!\u201d In the following video from the documentary, you can see how this anti-prank mechanism locks to a person\u2019s arm but detaches from the pole:\n\nThe proliferation of fire alarms in the early 1900s provided communities with an easier way to alert authorities in the case of an emergency. However, these devices also led to the rise of a new problem: pranksters and false alarms.\n\nA 1939 report published in Kentucky\u2019s The Owensboro Messenger stated that nearly 20% of local fire department runs originated with false alarms. The Morning Post of Camden, New Jersey, reported that there were 51 false alarms in 1934 and 76 more in 1936. That article recounted one unique fire-alarm prank involving a group of boys, a long string, and an innocent bystander:\n\nWhile the above-displayed newspaper clip relays a humorous anecdote, these false alarms didn\u2019t always end on an innocent note. In 1935, four firefighters were injured during a crash while responding to a false alarm. In 1930, the Associated Press reported that a firefighter in Chicago was severely (possibly gravely) injured due to a false alarm:\n\nThe \u201cwrist lock\u201d deterrent wasn\u2019t the first or only method fire departments deployed to prevent false alarms. In 1929, Popular Mechanics reported that \u201cexperiments (were) being conducted in New York with a fire-alarm box-equipped with a camera to detect the false-alarm joker and performers of other pranks that often lead to accidents and injuries to firemen.\u201d Firefighters in Oregon tried attaching a sign to these alarms that warned people \u201cA False Alarm May Cost a Life!\u201d Another attempt involved an \u201cear-shattering\u201d siren officials hoped would deter anyone from unnecessarily pulling the alarm. And firefighters in New Jersey added a special powder on the handles of fire alarms to help them identify any pranksters.\n\nDespite these efforts, false fire alarms persisted. In 1943, a fire chief in Kentucky said that the public might need an educational course on how to use fire alarms after a person mistook a fire alarm box for a mailbox and accidentally set off a false alarm:", "lang": "en"}
