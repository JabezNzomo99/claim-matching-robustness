In a dramatic turn of events on 23 June, hours after a pompous launch on national television, the Ayush Ministry asked the firm to stop selling and advertising the purported COVID medicine. According to a press release, the ministry asked Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd to send details of the drug, its composition, results collected from the studies, trials and other information before advertising or selling the drug. In a statement, the Uttarakhand Ayurvedic Department also distanced itself from the \u201cmiracle COVID cure\u201d revealing that Patanjali\u2019s application \u201cnever mentioned coronavirus\u201d and a license was only approved for its use as an immunity booster and a drug for cough and fever\u201d. \u2018Medicine Never Introduced For COVID\u2019: Patanjali\u2019s U-Turn on Coronil On Tuesday, 30 June, in a complete U-turn, Patanjali claimed that the medicine (Coronil) was never introduced as a cure for the novel coronavirus. \u201cWe never told that the medicine can cure or control coronavirus. We said that we had made medicines and used them in clinical controlled trial which cured corona patients. There is no confusion in it,\u201d Patanjali\u2019s co-founder Acharya Balkrishna told news agency ANI.\n\nCongress Handles Claim Indira Gandhi\u2019s Leh Photo to Be From Galwan But, this isn\u2019t the first time that the FMCG company has found itself in the middle of a controversy resulting from endorsing exaggerated and unproven cures. The firm and its co-founder, Yoga Guru Ramdev, has a murky history of claiming 100 percent treatment of cancer, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and even homosexuality. Ramdev\u2019s close aid and 94 percent stakeholder in Patanjali Ayurveda, Acharya Balkrishna, is no stranger to controversies either. His high school and Sanskrit degrees from Sampurnanand Sanskrit University, allegedly do not exist on records. Balakrishna was also charged with cheating and criminal conspiracy for procuring fake degrees to acquire an Indian passport. From Cancer to Homosexuality: Ramdev Has a Cure For Everything Ramdev, in the past, has claimed to cure cancer and HIV infection, which in later stages leads to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome or AIDS, with the help of yoga coupled with medicines provided by Divya Pharmacy and Patanjali Ayurveda. His claim was debunked by the National AIDS Control Organisation. Ramdev has also, time and again, reiterated that \u201cHomosexuality can be cured through yoga.\u201d Not just that, according to the self-styled healer, \u201cYoga can help women conceive a male child.\u201d In 2016, The Quint\u2019s reporters went undercover and investigated Patanjali\u2019s claims of \u201ccuring\u201d homosexuality.\n\nThe revelations were startling and hilarious. Not only was homosexuality categorised as a mental disease, but Patanjali also seemed to suggest a full-fledged course of treatment, including Yoga and medicines, to cure it. Misleading Advertisements: How Patanjali Uses Television Ads to Further Its Claims In December 2016, Patanjali Ayurveda was fined Rs 11 lakh for \"misbranding and putting up misleading advertisements\" of their products. This after samples of mustard oil, salt, besan, honey and other products of Patanjali Ayurveda failed quality tests. In the same year, advertising watchdog Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) had pulled up the firm for running \"misleading\" ad campaigns which disparage competitors' products.\n\u2022 In the promotion for its \u2018Kachi Ghani Mustard Oil\u2019 Patanjali claimed that that rival makers are selling mustard oil \"adulterated with oil made by solvent extraction process with neurotoxin containing Hexane\". A claim which was never substantiated.\n\u2022 In another instance of making false claims, while promoting Patanjali Fruit Juice, the firm claimed that rival brands are selling \"expensive juices containing less pulp\". Again, in the year 2017, ASCI found that 25 out of 33 advertisements of Patanjali violated the ASCI code. As per data shared by the government in the Lok Sabha, several complaints were received against 33 advertisements of Patanjali between April 2015 and July 2016. These included products in various sectors such as food and beverages, personal care and health care. \u2018Cathy Rolanova\u2019 \u2013 The Many Lies of a Self-Proclaimed OSINT Expert\n\nIt has been more than once that Patanjali products have been called out for sub-standard quality. An RTI filed in May 2017 revealed that nearly 40 percent of Ayurveda products, including items from Baba Ramdev\u2019s Patanjali, were found to be of substandard quality by Haridwar\u2019s Ayurveda and Unani Office. This included Patanjali\u2019s Divya Amla Juice and Shivlingi Beej. In April 2017, the Armed Forces Canteen Stores Department (CSD) had suspended the sale of a batch of Patanjali\u2019s amla juice after it failed a quality test carried out at West Bengal Public Health Laboratory. Ironically, even Patanjali Atta Noodles, pushed as an alternative to Nestle\u2019s Maggi after the latter was banned in India for containing excessive quantities of lead, ran into trouble. Tests carried out by the Food Safety and Drugs Administration (FSDA) in Meerut found a Patanjali Atta Noodles sample \"sub-standard\" and ash content in the noodle's tastemaker was more than the prescribed limits by nearly three times.\n\nAccording to the Managing Director of Patanjali Ayurveda, Acharya Balkrishna\u2019s own admission, the drug meets all standard parameters of \u2018Randomised Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials\u2019. The initial brief of the medicine by the company also suggested three major claims:\n\u2022 100 percent recovery from coronavirus infection within seven days of treatment with Patanjali Ayurvedic medicines.\n\u2022 Serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were reduced in the treatment group as compared to the placebo group. In an interview to Hindi news channel India TV, Baba Ramdev also claimed that there is no need to take any allopathic medicines besides \u2018Coronil\u2019. So, what are the factors which make Patanjali\u2019s claims look sketchy? A total of 100 COVID positive patients were recruited for the controlled clinical trial by Patanjali as per their own clams. Out of these only 95 were studied, 1 patient was lost on the follow-up details and 4 patients withdrew consent between the study. Severely symptomatic patients, patients with Acute Respiratory Syndrome and those with life expectancy of less than one year were excluded from the study. The mean age of patients was 35-45 and they all were either asymptomatic or had mild symptoms. No, Image Shared by Malviya Isn\u2019t From Gandhis\u2019 2008 China Visit\n\nThe Quint reached out to Dr SP Kalantri, the Medical Superintendent at the Kasturba Hospital who said, \u201cThe people enrolled for this study are all young people of around 35 years of age. They were all asymptomatic or had mild symptoms and none of them had comorbidities like heart disease or lung disease.\u201d \u201cIn effect, perfectly normal and previously healthy individuals who just happened to get infected were picked for the study. This clearly hints at a selection bias.\u201d Further, no detail was provided on how did the researchers selected the patients for the trial which suggests that it was based on convenient selection for desirable results. The #PatanjaliAyurved clinical trial protocol doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mention a word on allocation concealment and blinding. A study endpoint is the \u00e2\u0080\u009cconversion of symptomatic to asymptomatic patient\u00e2\u0080\u009d. This bias might seriously destroy the validity of the trial. pic.twitter.com/7bUC8f9aFw \u2014 SP Kalantri (@spkalantri) June 24, 2020 2. CREDIBILITY OF RESEARCHERS INVOLVED IN THE TRIAL The drug trial for Coronil \u2013 supposed to be made of Ashwagandha, Giloy and Tulsi \u2013 was conducted by the National Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) in Jaipur on behalf of Patanjali. We looked up on the website of the organisation and found little details about their prior work or expertise in the area. We also found that NIMS is not registered with the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation. Dr Kalantri points out the same. \u201cThe researchers who were doing this trial are not very experienced in conducting such trials. Also, the ethics committee of the hospital these trials must be registered with the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (cdsco), which isn\u2019t the case here,\u201d he said.\n\nFurther, several experts pointed out that the results of the clinical trial by Patanjali were never published in any scientific journal for review. Even the Ayush Ministry and Uttarakhand Ayurvedic Department distanced itself from the submissions. Patanjali blamed the situation on a communication gap and stated that the issue has been resolved. Further, the Ayush Ministry\u2019s acknowledgement letter for the submission of data of the clinical trial is now being shared as the resolution of conflict, thus insinuating that the issue has been solved. Why Rohingya Refugees Are an Easy Target for the Fake News Factory Before Coronil, Mustard Oil Was Ramdev\u2019s Magic Weapon Against Coronavirus Earlier this year, in April, Ramdev claimed that if one applies mustard oil through their nostril, the novel coronavirus would flow into one\u2019s stomach and would be killed by the acids present there. Several news outlets, including India Today, Business Today and Free Press Journal, carried Baba Ramdev\u2019s claims. \u201cIf those who have hypertension, heart problems, asthma, chronic diseases and are elderly, can hold their breath for 30 seconds, and those who are young for one minute, it means you do not have COVID-19, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic.\u201d\n\nThis claim was successfully debunked by The Quint and you can read the full report here. Not only did we fail to find any studies which could lend credibility to these claims, but Ramdev\u2019s treatment also found no support in healthcare experts who said that physical barriers like the Mustard Oil will not have any impact on coronavirus and its progression. This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Patanjali\u2019s unsubstantiated claims. But, the more pertinent question is, Why are people tempted to believe in \u201cmiracle drugs\u201d sold by one of India\u2019s fastest growing consumer goods company? The answer is Baba Ramdev\u2019s household appeal. His transformation from a Yoga Guru to an anti-corruption crusader and later into a businessman riding on the swadeshi wave has ensured that, despite failing to meet even basic standards of quality, Patanjali products remain popular among the masses. Also, keeping in mind a fawning media refusing to fact check Ramdev\u2019s claims and his ties with the government, looks like Patanjali is here to stay.
