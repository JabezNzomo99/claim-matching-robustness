{"title": "Is Trojan Selling Pre-Owned Condoms?", "subtitle": "While many companies are trying to be more green by recycling and reusing materials, there doesn't appear to be much of a market for used condoms.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2020-02-17T11:09:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-43058", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trojan-pre-owned-condoms/", "vclaim": "In February 2020, an image supposedly showing a new product from condom-maker Trojan circulated on social media.\n\nWhile the above-displayed image was frequently shared with humorous captions, some social media users appeared to find the product plausible enough to be real. But this is not a genuine photograph of a Trojan product. This is a digitally manipulated image created by Adam Padilla.\n\nPadilla posted this image to his Twitter account on Valentine\u2019s Day 2020. If you look in the top right of the image, just below the \u201cKY Me & You\u201d product, you can see a watermark for \u201cAdam.The.Creator.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time that Padilla\u2019s digital content has managed to fool viewers on social media. Padilla is behind other humorous fake products, such as baby\u2019s \u201cFirst Vape\u201d and \u201cMonster Energy Caffeinated Ham.\u201d\n\nWhile Trojan Pre-Owned Condoms aren\u2019t a genuine product, some condom manufacturers are trying to make a more environmentally-friendly condom. The company Glyde, for instance, bills itself as the \u201cfirst certified ethical, vegan, and fair-trade premium condom brand.\u201d Sustain Natural uses latex from a Fair Trade rubber plantation and manufactures their condoms in a solar-powered factory.\n\nThe New York Times reports that Trojan, too, makes some condoms that are free of nitrosamines, a possible carcinogen found in many popular condom brands.", "lang": "en"}
