And we then walked through with Mr. McGahn essentially why we were telling them about this and the first thing we did was to explain to Mr. McGahn that the underlying conduct that General Flynn had engaged in was problematic in and of itself. Secondly, we told him we felt like the vice president and others were entitled to know that the information that they were conveying to the American people wasn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nJan. 27\n\n McGahn asks Yates to come to the White House again to discuss the matter further. Yates testified that he did not indicate whether he had discussed the Flynn situation with anyone else at the White House. McGahn asked why the Justice Department would be concerned whether one White House official lied to another, she said. \u201cLogic would tell you that you don\u2019t want the national security adviser to be in a position where the Russians have leverage over him,\u201d she said.\n\nComey\u2019s version (from written congressional testimony, June 8):\n\n \u201cOn February 14, I went to the Oval Office for a scheduled counterterrorism briefing of the President,\u201d Comey said in his congressional testimony. \u201cThe President signaled the end of the briefing by thanking the group and telling them all that he wanted to speak to me alone\u2026.When the door by the grandfather clock closed, and we were alone, the President began by saying, \u2018I want to talk about Mike Flynn.\u2019 \u2026 The President began by saying Flynn hadn\u2019t done anything wrong in speaking with the Russians, but he had to let him go because he had misled the Vice President. He added that he had other concerns about Flynn, which he did not then specify\u2026 \u2018He is a good guy and has been through a lot.\u2019 He repeated that Flynn hadn\u2019t done anything wrong on his calls with the Russians, but had misled the Vice President. He then said, \u2018I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.\u2019 I replied only that \u2018he is a good guy.\u2019 \u2026I did not say I would \u2018let this go.\u2019\u201d", "lang": "en"}
