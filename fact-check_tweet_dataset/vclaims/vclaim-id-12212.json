We first checked the very same figures back in 2012, and we also checked a similar version last year. It\u2019s incorrect on every figure.\n\nA full British state pension (before top-ups and without partner support) is worth either \u00a3126 a week or \u00a3164 a week (around \u00a36,500 or \u00a38,500 per year) depending on when you were born. Partner support for a state pension recipient is worth up to \u00a368 a week (around \u00a33,500 per year)\u2014but has not been open to new applicants since 2010 and will end next year.\n\nPeople staying in the UK illegally aren\u2019t entitled to claim anything from the UK state.\n\nRefugees in the UK (in other words, people who have had an asylum claim approved) aren\u2019t entitled to any particular benefits aimed at them. They can receive the same benefit and pension payments as any UK citizen. It is theoretically possible to receive \u00a329,900 a year in household benefits, but this would be unusually high.\n\nAsylum seekers (who are applying for refugee status in the UK) are entitled to around \u00a338 per week per person if they are homeless and unable to afford food.\n\nThe full basic state pension is \u00a3125.95 a week (excluding top ups) for a man born before 6 April 1951 or a woman born before 6 April 1953.\n\nPensioners born after this date can claim the new state pension\u2014the full weekly rate is \u00a3164.35.\n\nPeople need to have 30 qualifying years (or 35 for the new state pension) of national insurance contributions to claim the full rate. Given that the viral image refers to a pensioner who paid national insurance their entire working life, we can assume that they have the 30 qualifying years.\n\nThis means a full state pension is worth around \u00a36,500 a year before top-ups\u2014or around \u00a38,500 if it\u2019s the new state pension.\n\nWe are not aware of any \u201chardship allowance\u201d for pensioners, but they can claim state benefits (some of which are pensioner-specific) to help with their income.\n\nA pensioner\u2019s spouse may be entitled to a state pension in their own right. Additionally, a state pensioner may get an \u201cAdult Dependency Increase\u201d if they have a partner who is financially dependent on them. The Department for Work and Pensions told us the full rate is \u00a368.35 a week\u2014around \u00a33,500 a year.\n\nHowever, this hasn\u2019t been open to new applicants since 2010, and will stop in April 2020.\n\nWhat can someone who is in the country illegally claim?\n\nNothing. People who are staying in the UK illegally are likely to be removed if their immigration status is discovered by the authorities, so they wouldn\u2019t be able to claim benefits without alerting the authorities to their status. They inherently do not have the right to work in the UK.\n\nIt depends whether you\u2019re talking about an asylum seeker or a refugee.\n\nAn asylum seeker (who is making an application for refugee status in the UK) can get \u00a337.75 per week, if they are homeless and not able to afford food. They can also be allocated some form of accommodation (which they cannot choose and is unlikely to be in London or the South East).\n\nAsylum seekers don\u2019t get a \u201cspouse allowance\u201d, rather an asylum seeker\u2019s spouse would be entitled to the same amount in their own right if they were also seeking asylum. We aren\u2019t aware of any \u201chardship allowance\u201d for refugees (as was the case when we checked the claim in 2011), and have asked the Home Office for more information.\n\nThis means an asylum seeker\u2019s total entitlement is \u00a337.75 per week (or \u00a32,000 per year)\u2014well below the \u00a3675 per week claimed in the viral image.\n\nWhere does the \u00a329,900 figure come from?\n\nIf an asylum seeker is granted refugee status in the UK, they could then claim benefits, tax credits and pension payments on the same basis as UK nationals. There aren\u2019t any specific benefits available just for refugees.\n\nIt is theoretically possible\u2014but very unlikely\u2014for a refugee household to receive \u00a329,900 a year in benefits, just as it is for UK nationals. This would only occur if they weren\u2019t subject to the benefit cap. Under the cap, the maximum total benefits a household in London containing a couple or a single person with children can receive is \u00a323,000, or around \u00a3442 a week. The cap is lower if you\u2019re a single adult or live outside London.\n\nSome people are not affected by the benefits cap, for example people over state pension age, and people getting Universal Credit because of a disability or health condition that stops them working.", "lang": "en"}
