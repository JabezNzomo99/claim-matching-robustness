The video is circulating on social media with a narrative about a child-lifting gang. The narrative propagated with this video claims that a gang of organ traders was arrested in Larankelo, Himachal Pradesh. The message stated that the members of the arrested gang have revealed that they are a group of 500 people who prowl in groups of 15-20 people that includes women and children. The message further urges people to not open their doors if they hear a baby cry at midnight. The message attempts to alert the cities \u2013 Ambala, Yamunanagar, Kurukesta Karnal and Panipat \u2013 located in Haryana. Alt News had received a request to fact-check the video on its official WhatsApp number.\n\nThe most commonly shared message with the aforementioned narrative reads as follows \u2013

claims to be the father of the child said that there was an attempt to abduct his child. \u201cEveryone should be made aware of this incident. This has happened to me today. So that it doesn\u2019t happen to anyone else. I have filed a report with the police. Police officials have come for an inspection. Please spread this, so that any untoward incident with anyone\u2019s child doesn\u2019t take place. The kind of incident that took place with me but my child is safe now. Thank you.\u201d, says the man facing the camera.\n\nAn extended version of the same video is also circulating on social media with a claim that this gang of 500 to 2000 people are Rohingya Muslims. The message gives the impression that it was circulated by the police, when it says, \u201cBhopal Police City Superintendent of Police [C.S.P]\u201d.\n\nAlt News broke the video into multiple key-frames using the digital verification tool Invid. We then performed a reverse search on one of the keyframes through which we found one of the earliest instances of the video uploaded on the Internet. A YouTube user Mayur Suratwala had uploaded the viral video on July 19, 2019. The user had posted one more video of the same incident from a different time-frame.\n\nIn the video posted above, the man can be heard saying that this is his child from \u201cIndus Realty\u201d. He further adds that he studies at Oriental school. On Google searching \u2013 \u201cIndus Realty\u201d \u2013 we found that the said housing project is located in Mandideep town of Raisen district, Madhya Pradesh.\n\nAlt News contacted Mandideep police station to check whether the said incident took place in their jurisdiction. We were informed that the video depicts an incident that took place in an area that falls under the jurisdiction of Satlapur police station.\n\nWe then got in touch with officials at Satlapur police station. SHO Piyush Charles told Alt News, \u201cIt\u2019s an old incident. It took place nearly 10-15 days back. We verified the boy\u2019s claim and found it to be implausible. The boy said that he had sensed someone coming towards him in the dark while he was going home from the path behind the buildings where he resides. According to the boy, sensing someone coming towards him, he took out his belt to scare him away. The boy also claimed that this person then ran away jumping a 6ft grill with extra fencing. We tried to verify his version and found that there were no footprints at the site and also there was no way anybody could jump that wall [grill]. No FIR was filed in the matter because it was totally implausible.\u201d\n\nIn conclusion, a video of a man who claimed that there was an attempt to kidnap his child in Madhya Pradesh was used by social media users to induce fear-mongering with regard to recent and on-going child-lifting rumours. It may be noted that the police has maintained that the incident couldn\u2019t have happened. Earlier, a video of a mentally-challenged person, who was taken hostage by the villagers in Raisen district, MP, was falsely shared as that of a child-lifter caught in the state. Alt News has also debunked a recent video of a drunk woman who was falsely accused of being child-kidnapper.", "lang": "en"}
