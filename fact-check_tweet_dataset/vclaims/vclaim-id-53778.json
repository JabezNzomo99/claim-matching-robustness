Any Covid-19 vaccine rolled out to the public, unlicensed or not, will still go through clinical trials. Licensing usually takes place after a vaccine has undergone various trials and can typically take weeks or even months.\n\nAny decision to fast track unlicensed vaccines would be a decision made nationally and not by individual suppliers. Manufacturers \u201ccannot generally be sued in the civil courts for the consequences resulting from the use of an unlicensed product, or a new use of a licensed product, that a national licensing authority is recommending in order to deal with certain specific health threats\u201d, according to a government consultation document.\n\nThis is a part of EU law which has been implemented into UK law.\n\nHowever, the government consultation document also states that the law \u201cdoes not provide complete immunity from civil liability.\u201d\n\nIf the product is not found to meet safety standards or is defective, then there is a liability.\n\nOne of the scientists working on a potential vaccine has stated that, while processes have been sped up, this doesn\u2019t mean steps to ensure safety have been missed.\n\nFurther guidance around what a breach of these standards would mean, or how it would be assessed is currently being consulted on.\n\nIt has also been recently reported that at least one potential Covid-19 vaccine manufacturer, AstraZeneca, has been exempted from future product liability claims with most of the countries it has supply agreements with. The article states it is not clear which specific countries this is, but it does have a supply agreement with Britain.", "lang": "en"}
