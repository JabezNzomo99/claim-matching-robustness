In Scotland it is 3.5 times. So what we are seeing here is that the policy of free tuition has not had the desired result.\"\n\nThere are two ways to look at this that we\u2019re aware of, both of which focus on 18 year olds. There are also some flaws with UCAS\u2019 data on Scottish education, which means that comparisons with England should be done cautiously. We\u2019ve written more about that here.\n\nThe claim is pretty much correct when it comes to how many students have been offered a university place from a particular group.\n\nUCAS university entry rates for 18 year olds in the most advantaged areas in Scotland were 3.5 times that of young people in the most disadvantaged areas in 2016, while in England young people in the most advantaged areas were 2.4 times as likely to attend university.\n\nThe claim is incorrect when it comes to application rates\u2014how many people apply to university from a particular group and what Ms Somerset Webb appears to be referring to in the claim. Ms Somerset Webb is getting back to us to confirm what evidence she was referring to.\n\nThe 2017 university application rate of 18 year olds living in the most advantaged areas in England was about 2.3 times that of students in the most disadvantaged areas.\n\nIn Scotland, students in the most advantaged areas were about 2.6 times as likely to apply to university in 2017 than those in the most disadvantaged areas.\n\nRemoving tuition fees in Scotland doesn\u2019t seem to have \u201cgiven Scotland any specific advantage...in relation to increasing overall levels of participation or participation by more disadvantaged groups\u201d, says the Sutton Trust. It said increased competition for places, due to not having enough university places to meet demand, has had a particularly bad effect on students from the most deprived backgrounds.\n\nThis is specifically in relation to university access. A substantial number of disadvantaged students study higher education in colleges in Scotland, and aren\u2019t reflected in these figures, which is one of the reasons why comparing university access in Scotland and England is tricky.", "lang": "en"}
