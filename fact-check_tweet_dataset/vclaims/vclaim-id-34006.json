A number of nations, including the U.S., Russia and India, are currently developing such weapons for military purposes.\n\nA viral image, posted Oct. 28, falsely alleged that three different photographs show directed-energy weapons starting wildfires, with the caption saying, \u201cThis is what is believed to be responsible for those #California wild fires (sic) it\u2019s called \u2018DEW\u2019 direct energy weapons.\u201d (RELATED: Did Climate Change Cause The California Wildfires?)\n\nThe image on the left actually shows a SpaceX rocket launching from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California last year. The original photograph, found through a reverse image search, appears on the aerospace company\u2019s official Instagram page.\n\nThe upper-right photo, debunked by Snopes in 2018, likely depicts light from a controlled gas flare at an Ohio oil refinery reflecting off ice particles in the atmosphere. This optical phenomenon, also called a light pillar, can occur in cold weather conditions.\n\nTweeted out by the Forest Service of Klamath National Forest, the lower-right picture does show a California wildfire \u2013 and a white line appearing to extend from the sky to the ground. The Forest Service, whose firefighters took the photo, clarified in another tweet that the line was a camera lens flare.\n\nMedia outlets have debunked similar conspiracy theories related to wildfires on numerous occasions in recent years.", "lang": "en"}
