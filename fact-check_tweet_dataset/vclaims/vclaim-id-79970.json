In the previous eight years, no Marines volunteered for this duty, they had to be \u2018assigned.\u2019 Speaks volumes.\"\n\nThe photo post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe claim, which started circulating online shortly after Trump\u2019s inauguration in January 2017, is inaccurate.\n\nThe post contains no sources or citations, and its specifics, particularly the 13,506 number, appears to be made up.\n\nService members in the U.S. Marine Corps do not typically volunteer for White House guard positions, but are assigned from a pool of candidates deemed eligible, a Marines spokesperson told PolitiFact.\n\n\"Marines serving in White House duty are generally not volunteers and are assigned from the eligible population through the Marine Corps' routine manpower processes,\" Capt. Karoline Foote, Marine Corps Communication Strategy & Operations Officer wrote in an email. \"Most Marines who serve at the White House are assigned to the position based on the needs of the Marine Corps and after a lengthy and detailed screening process.\"\n\nA small number of positions, Capt. Foote told us, are filled by noncommissioned officers, who are also screened and vetted thoroughly. She explained these volunteers number in the dozens \u2013 not the tens of thousands, as the post claims.\n\nThe main post for White House Marine sentries is standing outside the door of the West Wing whenever the president is working. Four work at a time in shifts of 30 minutes on, 30 minutes off.\n\nA Facebook post showed a photo of Melania Trump escorted by a Marine and claims that over 13,000 Marines have applied for White House duty since Trump\u2019s inauguration and that zero did so when Obama was president.\n\nThe strangely specific claim appears to be fabricated, contains no sourcing and does not line up with the actual process in which Marine sentries are assigned to the White House.", "lang": "en"}
