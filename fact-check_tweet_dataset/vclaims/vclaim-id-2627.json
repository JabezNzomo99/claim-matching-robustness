On Monday, the Prime Minister said the [EU] customs union was not a binary choice. I can't think of anything other than a binary choice is [sic] whether you have a border or whether you don't have a border.\u201d\n\nIt seems odd to say that a customs union doesn\u2019t involve borders.\n\nA 'customs union' is a free trade area whose members apply the same taxes and quotas on imports from countries outside it.\n\nThe most famous example of a customs union, as the OECD puts it, is the EU\u2019s version (although some non-EU countries are also part of it, notably Turkey). It\u2019s different to the \u2018single market\u2019, which is about the EU\u2019s internal trade rules rather than its relationship with external countries.\n\nAll EU countries charge the same taxes on imports from outside the EU\u2014the \u201ccommon external tariff\u201d, as it\u2019s known. The reasoning is as follows (using an example poached from the Economist):\n\n\u201cIf France had zero tariffs on Japanese whisky, but Britain had a 10% tariff, then it would be a profitable wheeze to export Japanese whisky to France, and thence (freely) to Britain. So Britain would have to carefully monitor whisky imports from France, and slap a tariff on any Japanese stuff sneaking in (so-called \u201crules of origin\u201d regulations).\u201d\n\nSuch rules of origin checks are in place between the EU and Norway, for example, because the latter isn\u2019t in the customs union. That suggests that if the UK were outside the customs union, but Ireland remained within it, the same would have to happen on the Northern Irish land border.\n\nThe government took this view as recently as February, as do other researchers.\n\nDoes all this constitute a \u201cborder\u201d? As a general concept: yes. It\u2019s a legal barrier between countries.\n\nIn practical, physical terms: not necessarily. As we\u2019ve discussed before, customs checks between Sweden and Norway are fairly light touch. There will have to be checks on products crossing the Irish border, but they might not be particularly intrusive.\n\nMrs May could be saying that people travelling between countries won\u2019t experience a \u201cborder\u201d in these circumstances. It\u2019s true that passport controls are a different issue.\n\nThe government has produced a position paper on what the UK wants its future customs arrangements to look like. We\u2019ve written about it here.", "lang": "en"}
