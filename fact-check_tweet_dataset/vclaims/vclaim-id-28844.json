Among them was a 2017 study from the libertarian-leaning Institute for Justice and a 2017 article from the New York Times. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a cosmetologist or a barber, and if you\u2019re licensed, you can raise your own wages as much as 15 to 20 percent over the course of your lifetime,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s a huge benefit to those people in the occupation, and they\u2019re willing to spend a lot of money to lobby to have those regulations initiated and to ratchet up those requirements.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s not a whole lot of literature to back that up. \u201cThere\u2019s some evidence that, for example, the licensing of midwives in the early 1900s helped reduce infant and mother\u2019s mortality rates, but that\u2019s one of the few studies that have been fairly conclusive,\u201d Kleiner said.\n\nThere\u2019s still a heated debate on the number of training hours, deregulation and what adjacent professions should be regulated, if any. Hair braiding has been a lightning rod for politicians. Former vice president Joe Biden recently brought up his dissatisfaction with hair-braiding regulations during a campaign speech: \u201cIf you are a hair braider, you braid people\u2019s hair, you have to get a license to do something like 400 hours of training in another state.\u201d\n\nDestinee Wright is a hair braider in Virginia and understands the value in training but does not think it should be mandatory. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary for something that a lot of us learn from our moms or that gets passed down,\u201d she said. She\u2019s also worried about access.\n\nBut Guarniere and other cosmetologists still say the industry needs licensing to protect customers. \u201cThis is much more than just \u2018I want a haircut,\u2019 \u201d Guarniere said. \u201cSomeone that didn\u2019t know what they were doing with the chemicals to put on your head could burn you severely, causing your hair to fall out and really damaging or hurting you.\u201d\n\nHe also said that 1,500 hours is not enough to properly train a cosmetologist: \u201cIt\u2019s very challenging for us to teach a student how to be a successful cosmetologist in 1,500 hours. There is a huge difference between having a license and being able to have a career.\u201d But whether it\u2019s up to the government to regulate training of a craft versus safety standards is still up for debate.\n\nPoliticians may agree that occupational licensing laws need to be reviewed, but they should be wary of comparing professions. Each industry has unique challenges and responsibilities to the public. Cosmetologists may train longer than emergency medical technicians, but comparing two dramatically different fields misses the larger point about what the aim of licenses is and whom they are designed to protect.\n\nWe started on this fact check because we spotted a comment by Trump, but it turns out this is a bipartisan failure. Politicians need to be more careful about making such apples-to-oranges comparisons. Otherwise, they\u2019ll earn Two Pinocchios. (The video above is part of a YouTube series from the Fact Checker.
