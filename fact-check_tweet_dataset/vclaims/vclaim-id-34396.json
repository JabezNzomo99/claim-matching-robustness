The title of the article while citing a statement by self-proclaimed saint Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati reads, \u201cAll accused of Hyderabad Rape were Muslims, police admit to change their names\u201d.\n\n\u201cYati Narsinghanand Saraswati said that the name of three rapists has been changed to Hindu by police under the pretext of the minor. But the truth is that they all were Muslim\u201d, stated the article published on December 4, 2019.\n\nMultiple users on social media have shared the article with similar claims. Twitter user Jagadish Hiremut posted the article saying, \u201cCan anyone confirm this story. If it is true then Hyderabad police & their political masters are bigger criminals\u201d.\n\nMeena Das Narayan, a verified Twitter handle who claims to be the \u201cEditor-in Chief of Gulf Connoisseur\u201d and is followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the platform, also posted the article. She tweeted, \u201cNames changed by Police to hide religion of rapist\u201d. The tweet has now been taken down. You can access the archived version here.\n\n\n\nOn December 2, Narsinghanand Saraswati claimed via a video that all the rape-accused in the Hyderabad rape case were minors, hence the names given by the police are \u201cfictional\u201d. He also added that all the accused are from the same religion. A post on Twitter from his handle, which includes the video, has amassed over 2,100 retweets so far.\n\nIn the video, an article by website Hinduexistence.org published on November 29, 2019, was cited as the source.\n\nAlt News found that the claim about the police hiding the religious identity of the rape-accused because they were minors is false. In a press note issued by the Cyberabad police, the age of the all the four accused is mentioned. None of the accused is below 18.\n\nThe same was reiterated in a press briefing after the incident. The police identified the accused as \u2013 Pasha, 26-year-old lorry driver, Shiva and Naveen, 20-year-old lorry cleaners and Keshavulu, 20-year-old lorry driver.\n\nMoreover, The Quint spoke with the families of all the four accused. The article identified Jollu Shiva\u2019s father as Jollu Rajappa, Jollu Naveen\u2019s mother as Laxmi (sister of Jollu Rajappa), Chintakunta Chennakeshavulu\u2019s mother is Jayamma, and Mohammed alias Areef\u2019s mother Molanbi.\n\nCyberabad police responded to a query on Twitter regarding Saraswati\u2019s claim and dubbed it, \u201cfake news\u201d.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that three of four accused in the Hyderabad rape case were Muslims and minors hence given fictional Hindu identities is false. Cyberabad has also called out the claim on Twitter.", "lang": "en"}
