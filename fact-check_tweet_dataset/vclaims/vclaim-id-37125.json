The photograph has been posted below. In the past, the same photograph had been used to insinuate that Rahul Gandhi had secretly met the Chinese envoy at a time when Indian and Chinese troops were locked in a tense stand-off at Doklam in 2017. The Truth Behind the Image Alt News had earlier reported that in July 2017, Republic TV and Times Now had used the same image to target the Congress president, claiming that the photograph was \u2018undated\u2019 and \u2018unverified\u2019. It only took a reverse image search to establish the veracity of the photograph. The image tweeted by the two channels was neither unverified nor undated and has been available on the internet since 21 April 2017 on the Chinese Embassy website. Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Vadra and Robert Vadra had attended a Chinese food festival. The same food festival was attended by Union Minister Suresh Prabhu, Sitaram Yechuri from CPIM, KC Tyagi from JDU and other leaders from BJP such as Tarun Vijay and Udit Raj.
