A Facebook user Harish Ramchandra claimed that West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee directed her ministers to not chant Vande Mataram. The user also posted a video to reinforce his claim.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be completely false. We also found that the video is at least 13 years old.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nThe message posted with the video said, \"West Bengal Chief Minister Ms Mamata Benerjee has directed to her ministries of meeting that don't chant Vande Mataram. She said Vande Mataram is my foot (sic).\" The post further said, \"You can see the result of angry ministers and MLAs\". The user also urged people to share the video with their friends and other groups.\n\nThe 3-minute 50-second long video shows Mamata Banerjee agitatedly talking to some people after which party workers ransacked the state Assembly. Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Saugata Roy, TMC general secretary and minister Partha Chatterjee along with another party leader Sonali Guha can also be seen in the video.\n\nAFWA did a reverse search of the video through and found that it is an old video. The original video is 8-minute 23-second long and was first uploaded on YouTube on April 11, 2011.\n\nWe also searched using the keywords 'trinamool congress rampage assembly'. The search results showed several news reports of the incident that took place in 2006 during Mamata Banerjee's campaign in Singur. At the time, she launched a major agitation to protest the acquisition of farmland for Tata Motors' Nano car production factory.\n\nIn the video, Banerjee was seen shouting and holding a book in hand, which she claimed was a copy of Indian Constitution. She was asking if section 144 was imposed in Singur and on what basis she could be prevented from entering the area. Also, her party workers are seen chanting Vande Mataram while vandalising furniture and property inside the state Assembly.\n\nBanerjee was neither seen instructing her party workers to not chant Vande Mataram, nor did she say \"Vande Mataram is my foot\". Instead, she was seen complaining against the police and the then left-front government from obstructing her from entering Singur.", "lang": "en"}
