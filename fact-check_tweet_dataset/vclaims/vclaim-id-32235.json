Devin Nunes, R-Calif.\n\nThe post, which includes a quote about President Donald Trump alongside an image of Nunes, was shared in a popular liberal Facebook page called Go Left. The post claims to be based on leaked audio from July 2019.\n\n\"Defending Trump is more important than the United States,\" the image reads.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared more than 1,400 times on several social media platforms.\n\nWe reached out to Go Left for its evidence for the post, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\n\nAs the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, Nunes was one of Trump\u2019s staunchest defenders during the president\u2019s impeachment. But the Facebook post is inaccurate \u2014 the leaked audio it cites was recorded in July 2018, not 2019. And Nunes didn\u2019t say anything close to the quote Go Left published.\n\nThe audio was recorded at a private fundraiser for Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., that Nunes attended in July 2018. MSNBC first obtained and aired the clips during the Rachel Maddow Show on Aug. 8, 2018.\n\nNunes\u2019 comments focused on former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of 2016 Russian election interference and the role of the Trump campaign.\n\n\"So therein lies, so it\u2019s like your classic Catch-22 situation where we were at a \u2013 this puts us in such a tough spot. If (then-Attorney General Jeff) Sessions won\u2019t unrecuse and Mueller won\u2019t clear the president, we\u2019re the only ones. Which is really the danger,\" Nunes said in one of the clips that MSNBC published. \"That\u2019s why I keep, and thank you for saying it by the way, I mean we have to keep all these seats. We have to keep the majority. If we do not keep the majority, all of this goes away.\"\n\nThe audio shows that Nunes was interested in defending Trump from the Mueller investigation to try and keep the Republican majority in Congress ahead of the midterm elections. But none of the four clips that MSNBC published included Nunes saying anything close to \"defending Trump is more important than the United States.\" That distortion was added later by several liberal blogs and YouTube videos.\n\nWe reached out to Nunes\u2019 press office for comment, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\n\nThe Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
