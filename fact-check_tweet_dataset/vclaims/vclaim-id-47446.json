The claim has been refuted by attorneys and North Carolina sheriff\u2019s offices.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people wear face covering in public to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus. In accordance with those guidelines, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper announced on June 24 that face coverings must be worn \u201cin public places, indoors or outdoors,\u201d according to The Associated Press.\n\nA viral post alleges that it is a class H felony to wear a mask while legally carrying a concealed weapon in North Carolina under state statute 14-12. The sentence for a class H felony can be up to a maximum of 39 months in prison, per the North Carolina Sentencing and Policy Advisory Commission.\n\n\u201cFor those of you like myself that has your concealed carry permit and carry, you can be charged with a class H felony for wearing a mask and concealed carrying,\u201d the post reads. \u201cOnce you have a felony you can no longer carry.\u201d (RELATED: Viral Image Claims It Is Illegal To Wear A Mask If You Have A Concealed Carry Permit In Pennsylvania)\n\nThe state statute 14-12.8 mandates that \u201cno person or persons shall in this State, while wearing any mask, hood or device whereby the person, face or voice is disguised so as to conceal the identity of the wearer, enter, or appear upon or within the public property of any municipality or county of the State, or of the State of North Carolina.\u201d\n\nHowever, the North Carolina state legislature temporarily amended statute 14-12 in May to allow any person to wear a mask \u201cfor the purpose of ensuring the physical health or safety of the wearer or others\u201d according to local ABC affiliate WLOS. The amendment stipulated that a person wearing a mask for health reasons must remove it upon the request of a law enforcement officer.\n\nGregory Herman-Giddens, an attorney with the Southern Gun Law Group, confirmed with the Daily Caller in an email that wearing a mask for health reasons does not violate the law.\n\n\u201cIt certainly could be used as grounds, but the statute uses the word \u2018disguised\u2019 which, as you say, means purposefully concealing one\u2019s identity,\u201d Herman\u2011Giddens said. \u201cSo wearing a mask for health reasons, particularly if under a governmental order, would not violate the law.\u201d\n\nRon Shook, a criminal defense attorney, also told the Caller that the Facebook post was \u201ctotally wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re wearing a mask for the health and safety of yourself and others and you\u2019re carrying \u2026 a concealed carry permit, and you fit within that exception, you\u2019re fine,\u201d Shook said in a phone interview.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s offices for Guildford County, Forsyth County and Cabarrus County, all located in North Carolina, have debunked the claim on social media as well.\n\n\u201cAs for COVID-19, the bottom line is that if you have a valid Concealed Carry permit, you may carry a concealed handgun while wearing a mask as protection from COVID-19 until August 1, 2020 (unless that date is extended by the Governor and/or General Assembly),\u201d reads a press release from the Guildford County Sheriff\u2019s Office. \u201cThe mask must, however, be worn for health/safety reasons \u2013 not to hide or disguise your identity \u2013 and the mask must be removed if you are asked to do so by a Law Enforcement Officer.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
