Clip is Old\n\n\u201cThe claims on social media are baseless. The notice was issued to former BSP MLA Guddu Pandit, who refused to accept it after which the police pasted it outside his house. Taking advantage of the situation, he and his men shared the message on social media to malign the image of UP Police. Pandit wants to use this situation for political gains. He has been feeding a large number of people at his house without following social distancing norms.
