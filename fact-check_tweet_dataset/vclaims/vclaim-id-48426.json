(RELATED: Did John Quincy Adams Pen This Quote On Leadership?)\n\nYet, he is frequently credited with quotes on the internet. There is no evidence that he authored the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. The Daily Caller found no record of the statement in his collected writings, nor in any of his letters.\n\nBlaine McCormick, a professor at Baylor University and author of \u201cBen Franklin: America\u2019s Original Entrepreneur,\u201d noted that the statement did not sound \u201cColonial\u201d in a 2015 press release, in which he also debunked a number of other quotes from Franklin.\n\nThe website Quote Investigator found the earliest instance of a variant expression in a 1919 edition of the periodical \u201cThe Biblical World.\u201d In that publication, pastor H.K. Williams is quoted as saying, \u201cRemember, if you fail to prepare, you are preparing to fail.\u201d\n\nWilliams, however, was likely citing an aphorism already in circulation and did not originate it himself, according to Quote Investigator.", "lang": "en"}
