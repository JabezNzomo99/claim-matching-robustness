Antonio Trillanes IV \u201csh*tholes.\u201d\n\n\n\nFollowing a reader\u2019s tip, VERA Files Fact Check looked into the Jan. 15 story, \u201cThere Are Two Other Sh*tholes in the Philippines\u2014Trump,\u201d which claimed Trump called Trillanes and Aquino \u201csh*tholes\u201d who \u201ccan\u2019t give President Rodrigo Duterte the peace of mind to deliver to his people.\u201d\n\nThe story is fake. No legitimate local or international news website reported it.\n\nTelegraph is hosted on \u201ctelegraph-tv.com,\u201d which appears to mimic British broadsheet The Telegraph, whose website is \u201ctelegraph.co.uk.\u201d\n\nTweaking domain names by adding characters like \u201c-tv\u201d is a common scheme impostor sites use to trick readers into believing they are genuine news sources, as in the case of \u201caljazeeranews-tv.com\u201d and \u201cfrance24-tv.com,\u201d two fake news sites that mimicked media outfits Al-Jazeera and France-24. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: News on Duterte\u2019s ICC trial fake and THIS WEEK IN FAKE NEWS: There is NO news site Aljazeera-tv.com)\n\nAlso telltale signs of a bogus website: no About Us and Contact Us pages, among others.\n\nThe Telegraph fake report was shared on Facebook by \u201cTEAM DUTERTE FOR FEDERALISM,\u201d a page with more than 149,000 followers.\n\nIt circulated following outrage against Trump\u2019s racially charged Jan. 11 remark calling Haiti, El Salvador and poorer African countries \u201csh*thole countries.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
