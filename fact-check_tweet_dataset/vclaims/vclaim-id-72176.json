Roosevelt appointed Witte chairman of the Presidential Committee on Economic Security, which essentially crafted the plan for Social Security in 1935.\n\u2022 Arthur Altmeyer, a UW-Madison graduate and professor who also sat on the committee. Altmeyer later served on the federal Social Security Board and was the first Social Security commissioner. Roosevelt called Altmeyer \"Mr. Social Security,\" according to the Social Security Administration.\n\u2022 UW-Madison professor John Commons, under whom Witte and Altmeyer studied. Commons was a labor economist at UW from 1904-1933 where he helped develop the state\u2019s employee compensation program and civil service law. He was known as the \"spiritual father of Social Security,\" according to the Wisconsin Historical Society.\n\u2022 Wilbur Cohen, who served as a research assistant to Witte after graduating from UW-Madison in 1934. Cohen sat on the Committee on Public Administration of the Social Science Research Council and also advised the Social Security Board.\n\nCurrent UW-Madison professor Pamela Herd agreed that Wisconsinites tied to the university were key figures in the development of Social Security.\n\n\"There were a lot of people involved in the creation of this program, but some of the most important players were from Wisconsin,\" said Herd, an expert on Social Security.\n\nFeingold said that the idea for Social Security \"was basically invented up on Bascom Hill, my alma mater here; that's where Franklin Roosevelt got the idea.\"\n\nHistorical accounts show, and an expert agrees, that officials who helped propose and initially operate Social Security had deep ties to UW-Madison.", "lang": "en"}
