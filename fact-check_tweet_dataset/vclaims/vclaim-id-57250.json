That\u2019s less clear.\n\n \n\n Left unspoken by Kremer are several other important components of the federal budget. The remaining $334 billion for fiscal year 2011 would have to cover such expenses as these:\n\n \n\n Other mandatory programs: $716 billion\n\n Non-security discretionary spending: $507 billion\n\n Security discretionary spending (primarily defense and homeland security: $908 billion\n\n \n\n Total: $2.131 trillion.\n\n \n\n Now, it\u2019s certainly possible to shrink these categories -- but getting down to $300 billion or $400 billion is not easy.\n\n \n\n \"Other mandatory programs\" include those that are not funded annually by Congress but instead receive funds according to a pre-set formula. These include federal civilian and military retirement benefits, food stamps, unemployment compensation and veterans benefits. It\u2019s possible to rewrite formulas for these programs in a way that drastically shrinks or even eliminates them, but it would pose a major challenge, both legislatively and politically.\n\n \n\n The second category -- non-security discretionary spending -- is easier to cut in a practical sense, but even within this category are lots of expenditures that, while discretionary, aren\u2019t easy to let go of, from food and drug safety to air traffic control.\n\n \n\n Finally, Kremer\u2019s comparison devotes not a dime to either the military or homeland security. Even cutting the current amount in half -- a course that\u2019s almost entirely impractical in the short term -- would exceed Kremer\u2019s excess amount for 2011 by more than one-third.\n\n \n\n \"Long before the country had Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security, it had an Army and Navy,\" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. \"I think the omission of \u2018national defense\u2019 from Ms. Kremer\u2019s list of essentials is a pretty important clarification.\"\n\n \n\n Rating Kremer\u2019s statement is challenging, because what she said is undeniably true, but narrowly so, with missing factors that undercut her statement\u2019s relevance. When we asked an ideologically diverse group of economists how useful they thought Kremer\u2019s formulation was, their answers ranged widely.\n\n \n\n For instance, J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation, noted that some of the excess costs that Kremer left out of the equation could be picked up by reining in factors she did include. \"If we're going to play \u2018what if,\u2019 then you have to allow that she may have wanted to cut some of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security to make room for other spending that was off the list,\" he said.\n\n \n\n Kremer deserves credit for doing the math correctly. However, her decision to ignore defense and homeland security spending -- to say nothing of mandatory programs like veterans benefits and safety-related discretionary spending -- makes the comparison of questionable value to a discussion of the nation\u2019s budget problems.
