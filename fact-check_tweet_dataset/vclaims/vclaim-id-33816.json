The video was posted on what appears to be a fake news website that has no apparent affiliation with BBC News.\n\nJohnson, known for roles like \u201cBallers\u201d and \u201cJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,\u201d isn\u2019t the first celebrity to fall victim to a death hoax this year. In September, social media users speculated that actor Clint Eastwood had died from a heart attack while filming a commercial. (RELATED: Did Clint Eastwood Die From A Heart Attack Like This Facebook Post Claims?)\n\nThis Facebook post links to a video masquerading as content from BBC News, with the headline reading, \u201cACTUAL FOOTAGE: Dwyne (sic) \u2018The Rock\u2019 Johnson Dies at 47 After a Terrible Stunt Attempt Failed.\u201d It includes footage of \u201cGood Morning America\u201d anchor Robin Roberts presumably reporting on the death of another celebrity.\n\nThe video appears nowhere on the BBC News website nor on the network\u2019s social media accounts. The website hosting the video has no apparent affiliation with BBC News and seems to be a fake news site.\n\nContrary to the post\u2019s claim, Johnson is very much alive. He has been active on his social media accounts since the post was shared on Nov. 13. For instance, Johnson wished \u201cJumanji: The Next Level\u201d co-star Danny DeVito a \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d on Instagram Nov. 17.\n\nFalse rumors of Johnson having died previously circulated in 2011, 2014 and 2017, according to Snopes. \u201cRumors of my death are false,\u201d he wrote on Facebook in 2011. \u201cI\u2019m still \u2018Bringin\u2019 It\u2019 24hrs a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year \u2013 including leap year!\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s cousin, Tanoai Reed, has been Johnson\u2019s main stunt double for nearly 20 years, according to Men\u2019s Health.", "lang": "en"}
