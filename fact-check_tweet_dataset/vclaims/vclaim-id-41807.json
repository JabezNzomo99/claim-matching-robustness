Along with other posts, a video started surfacing on the internet showing hailstorm in a field filled with water.\n\nThe caption of the video read: \u201c Today at Pendra Chhattisgarh #hailstorm #rainfall \u201d\n\nWhen the team at NewsMobile did a fact check, we found that the claim attached with the video is fake.\n\nWhen we extracted the keyframes of the video through InVid and put them through Reverse Image Search, we found that the same video was circulated on April 24, with a claim that the hailstorm was observed in Cao Bang, Vietnam.\n\nNewsMobile independently couldn\u2019t verify the origin of the video as the video was in circulation before the heavy rainfall.\n\nHence, it is clear that the claim attached to the picture is false and it is not from Chhattisgarh.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
