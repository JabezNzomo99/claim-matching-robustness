{"title": "Analysis | Obama\u2019s pledge that \u2018no one will take away\u2019 your health plan", "subtitle": "One of the president's most famous promises turns out to be wrong -- and earns 4 Pinocchios.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-05-01T15:14:33Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85999", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2013/10/30/obamas-pledge-that-no-one-will-take-away-your-health-plan/", "vclaim": "If you dig into the regulations (go to page 34560), you will see that HHS wrote them extremely tight. One provision says that if co-payment increases by more than $5, plus medical cost of inflation, then the plan can no longer be grandfathered. (With last year\u2019s inflation rate of 4 percent, that means the co-pay could not increase by more than $5.20. *Update: Oops, this figure is not correct. See note below.) Another provision says the co-insurance rate could not be increased at all above the level it was on March 23, 2010.\n\nStill, it\u2019s worth remembering that insurance companies pressed throughout the health-care debate to allow people to keep the policy they had effective at the end of 2013. The consequences of the unusual March 23, 2010, cut-off date are now being felt. HHS, when it drafted the interim rules, estimated that between 40 and 67 percent of policies in the individual market are in effect for less than one year. \u201cThese estimates assume that the policies that terminate are replaced by new individual policies, and that these new policies are not, by definition, grandfathered,\u201d the rules noted. (See page 34553.)\n\nThe administration is defending this pledge with a rather slim reed \u2014 that there is nothing in the law that makes insurance companies force people out of plans they were enrolled in before the law passed. That explanation conveniently ignores the regulations written by the administration to implement the law. Moreover, it also ignores the fact that the purpose of the law was to bolster coverage and mandate a robust set of benefits, whether someone wanted to pay for it or not.\n\n*Update: A reader, in a post on the Daily Kos, pointed out that we had incorrectly described the effect of this regulation concerning copays. The medical inflation rate that should be used is not the annual rate, but rather the total since the enactment of the law. Moreover, there is an alternative calculation that allows for even bigger increases for plans that had copays at $18 and above when the law was enacted. So, rather than $5.20, as originally stated in the column, it would be $5.90 for copays below $18, and then progressively higher after that.", "lang": "en"}
