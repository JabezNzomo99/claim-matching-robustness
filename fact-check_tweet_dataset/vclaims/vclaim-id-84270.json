The claim is false; the video has been captured from a news report broadcast in January 2017 about a child\u2019s death in Karachi; both the World Health Organization and the provincial health department in Pakistan said the child\u2019s death was not caused by the polio vaccine.\n\nThe video was published in this Facebook post on March 25, 2019.\n\nIt has been viewed more than 111,000 times and shared more than 5,800 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Urdu-language caption translates to English as: \"Two-month-old child died in Karachi because of polio drops,\" referring to the polio vaccine, which is usually administered orally.\n\nThe 46-second video shows a \"breaking news\" bulletin for Pakistani news channel News One.\n\nIn the clip, the female newsreader can be heard speaking in Urdu.
