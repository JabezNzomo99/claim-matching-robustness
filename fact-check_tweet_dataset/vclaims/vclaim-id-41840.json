It makes claims about the amount of money the \u201ccharity organisers\u201d are taking, and alleges that Captain Tom\u2019s family benefits from the money raised. This is incorrect.\n\nIt is correct that JustGiving keeps a percentage of the money raised through donations which goes towards service fees and operating costs. The figure given in the message may have been roughly accurate when the posts were published, and is now probably an underestimate. JustGiving told us that over 97% of the money raised goes to charity. We\u2019ve written more about that here.\n\nJustGiving also told us that the Maytrix Group, the company run by Captain Tom\u2019s daughter and son-in-law, does not receive any money from the fundraiser.\n\nThe amount raised has now far exceeded that. At the time of writing, over \u00a331 million has been donated to Captain Tom\u2019s fundraiser by over 1.3 million supporters, in aid of NHS Charities Together.\n\nDonations were at \u00a315 million on 16 April.\n\nThese figures don\u2019t include Gift Aid that could be claimed back and which currently amounts to an additional \u00a36 million.\n\nGift Aid allows charities to boost the value of donations from taxpayers by 25%. It essentially means that cash donations are treated as having been tax free, allowing charities to claim back the tax from HMRC.\n\nIt\u2019s slightly unclear what is meant here by the \u201ccharity organisers\u201d. As we\u2019ve said before, JustGiving charges payment processing fees for card or Paypal payments, which is 1.9% of the donation plus 20p. JustGiving says this charge \u201caccounts for the varying costs of processing different payment types\u201d. Donations made in another currency have a processing fee of 2.9% of the donation plus 20p.\n\nJustGiving also told us it keeps around 1% of the total donations to cover operating costs, though it was not able to give an exact figure for this as donations keep rising.\n\nThe platform has donated \u00a3100,000 to the fundraiser.\n\nAs we\u2019ve also said before, if a donor adds Gift Aid onto their donation, JustGiving deducts a 5% Gift Aid processing service fee. This is collected separately from the donations made. At the time of writing, almost \u00a36 million in Gift Aid had been collected (meaning a 5% processing fee would come to almost \u00a3300,000).\n\nThe \u00a3600,000 estimate for fees taken by JustGiving may have been in the right ballpark when the Facebook posts were published, but the real total is now likely higher than this as the total raised has also increased.\n\nCaptain Tom\u2019s daughter, Hannah Ingram-Moore, did help her father set up the fundraiser. She is also, along with her husband, the director of a company called the Maytrix Group. Speaking on LBC Radio, Ms Ingram-Moore also said that her company was initially sponsoring Captain Tom \u00a31 per length he walked. Maytrix receives no money from Captain Tom\u2019s fundraiser.\n\nA spokesperson for JustGiving confirmed to us that none of the money goes to the Maytrix Group and that the money did not go to anyone other than NHS Charities Together and JustGiving via fees.", "lang": "en"}
