It is not.\n\nThe claim that the Gates Foundation was kicked out of India is perhaps a distortion of news back in 2017 that the Indian government would partially fund an immunisation program in New Delhi.\n\nBefore this, the Gates Foundation had funded the program, and senior health ministry official Soumya Swaminathan told Reuters at the time: \u201cThere was a perception that an external agency is funding it, so there could be influence.\u201d\n\nWhen people started claiming that the Gates Foundation had been kicked out of India, the Indian government said this was not true and that \u201cBMGF [The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation] continues to collaborate and support the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.\u201d\n\nThe Foundation continues to work in India.\n\nThe claim the Gates Foundation disabled 47,000 children seems to come from a 2012 paper which claims that \u201cnon-polio acute flaccid paralysis\u201d (NPAFP) was more common in areas of India with higher uptake of the oral polio vaccine. The Foundation funds polio vaccine eradication efforts\n\nThe paper says that in 2011, there were an extra 47,500 cases of NPAFP above the \u201cstandard\u201d 2 cases per 100,000 people \u201cthat is generally accepted as the norm\u201d.\n\nUS fact checking website PolitiFact reported on a similar claim, that the Foundation had paralysed 496,000 children from a polio vaccine administered between 2000 and 2017.\n\nThis figure comes from a 2018 paper making the same argument, claiming that there were an \u201cadditional 491,000 paralyzed children above our expected numbers for children with NPAFP\u201d between 2000 and 2017.\n\nIt is true that the observed incidence of NPAFP cases increased in the late 2000s and has stayed relatively high, but this doesn\u2019t mean the polio vaccine was necessarily the cause.\n\nBack in 2013 the BBC reported that public health officials said that the increase could be put down to the fact that monitoring of cases of paralysis, whether caused by polio or not, was better than in previous decades.\n\nData from the National Polio Surveillance Project unit shows that while cases of NPAFP increased in the mid-2000s in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh where the vaccination work was concentrated, the incidence of polio-related AFP also increased before falling away.\n\nThis would support the theory about increased monitoring.\n\nWhile there may be a statistical correlation between the number of vaccination doses and cases of NPAFP, we\u2019ve found no evidence or theory which explains why this might be the case. NPAFP is caused by other viruses and bacteria besides polio.\n\nHowever other countries, including the UK, have also observed increased reports of unexplained AFP.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the polio vaccine can itself result in cases of \u201cvaccine-associated paralytic polio\u201d according to the World Health Organisation, but the rate is incredibly low. Approximately 1 in 2.7 million doses of the oral polio vaccine are associated with paralytic polio.", "lang": "en"}
