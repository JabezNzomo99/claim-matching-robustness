Schumer didn\u2019t post the supposed tweet criticizing President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to bar travelers from China.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has used Twitter to repeatedly criticize the Trump administration\u2019s response to the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\nBut screenshots circulating on Facebook use a fabricated post alongside one of Schumer\u2019s actual tweets to make the prominent Democrat look as if he contradicted himself.\n\nSchumer did indeed tweet on Feb. 24 that, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen no sign that President Trump has any plan or urgency to deal with the spread of the Coronavirus. We need real leadership, and we need it fast.\u201d\n\nBut the New York senator didn\u2019t tweet on Feb. 5 about Trump\u2019s \u201cpremature travel ban to and from China,\u201d as the doctored post shows. The fake tweet references the Trump administration\u2019s decision on Jan. 31 to bar foreign nationals from entering the country if they visited China in the preceding 14 days (with some exceptions).\n\nThe full fabricated tweet reads: \u201cThe premature travel ban to and from China by the current administration is just an excuse to further his ongoing war against immigrants. There must be a check and Balance on these restrictions.\u201d\n\nWe could find no such tweet by Schumer\u2019s account on his feed. ProPublica\u2019s tool to track deleted tweets from elected officials also shows no such tweet \u2014 or any other deleted tweet about the coronavirus \u2014 by Schumer. The senator\u2019s spokesman also confirmed to the Associated Press that the tweet was fabricated.\n\nSchumer\u2019s 14 tweets on Feb. 5 focused on the Senate impeachment trial of Trump, which was concluding; Trump\u2019s State of the Union address the night before; a black transgender activist; aid to Puerto Rico; and voting rights.\n\nSome who helped spread the fake tweet later corrected the record. The conservative Power Line blog declared it \u201ca hoax\u201d and apologized to readers.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
