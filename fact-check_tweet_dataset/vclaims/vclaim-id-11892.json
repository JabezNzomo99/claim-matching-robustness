They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they\u2019d still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe meme features a repurposed image of a younger Trump, with the quote billed as a statement he delivered in an interview with the magazine.\n\nSo did Donald Trump actually say that \u2013 or anything like it?\n\nNo, the quote is bogus.\n\nThe fabricated quote appeared on social media sites in October 2015, when Trump\u2019s campaign started to gain steam. The meme has continually resurfaced over the years, though it has repeatedly been debunked.\n\nWe searched People\u2019s archives, which date back to the 1970s, and found no Trump interviews in 1998 \u2013 or any other time \u2013 that feature that quote or anything resembling it.\n\nMost of the magazine\u2019s articles at the time that involved Trump discussed his celebrity and high-profile divorce from Marla Maples.\n\n\"PEOPLE looked into this matter exhaustively when the quote first surfaced,\" a magazine spokesperson said. \"We combed through every Trump story in our archive and did not find anything remotely like this quote \u2013 and no Trump interview in 1998.\"\n\nTrump did talk politics in the late 1980s and \u201990s, but there is no record of him bashing the Republican party, or its voters.\n\nFor example, in a 1988 episode of the Oprah Winfrey Show, Trump said he would probably never run for president, but wouldn\u2019t rule it out completely. The image used in the meme is from that interview:\n\nOn Sept. 30, 1999, Trump wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal and said he was considering a presidential run, and sounded as if he would do so as an independent.\n\n\"Unlike candidates from the two major parties, my candidacy would not represent an exercise in career advancement ... The Republicans are captives of their right wing. The Democrats are captives of their left wing. I don\u2019t hear anyone speaking for the working men and women in the center.\"\n\nJust a few days later, on Oct. 8, 1999, Trump appeared on CNN\u2019s Larry King Live and said he formed a committee to explore a presidential run and that he was a registered Republican.\n\nA meme claims Donald Trump said in an interview 20 years ago that if he ever ran for president, he would do so as a Republican because they were \"the dumbest group of voters in the country\" and \"they believe anything on Fox News.\"\n\nWhile Trump flirted with the idea of a presidential run in a few interviews in the late 1990s, there is no record of Trump saying this quote in People, or in any other publication.\n\nDespite the quote\u2019s repeated debunking, it has shown up across social media consistently over the years.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
