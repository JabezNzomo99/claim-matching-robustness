Acknowledgement motivates us to work harder and make India proud. #bharatkilaxmi.\u201d From Mary Kom to Pooja Dhanda, from P.V. Sindhu to Saina Nehwal, India\u2019s top sportswomen were assigned to tweet the above text this Diwali eve. The result is multiple sportswomen tweeting identical text from their official twitter handles, lauding PM Narendra Modi\u2019s efforts on women empowerment.\n\nTwitter users were treated to identical tweets with the hashtag #BharatkiLaxmi.\n\nLike PV Sindhu, most sportswomen either quote tweeted or tagged Kiren Rijiju, the Minister of State (independent charge) for Youth Affairs and Sports.\n\nMuch to everybody\u2019s amusement, some of them missed removing the word \u201cText:\u201d from the message provided to them to tweet. Pooja Dhanda deleted her tweet after many users pointed this out.\n\nThe coordinated campaign for #BharatkiLaxmi was kicked-off a few days ago with a video featuring P.V Sindhu and Deepika Padukone. The video was shared by PV Sindhu saying, \u201cI support PM @narendramodi ji #BharatKiLaxmi movement.\u201d This was retweeted PM Modi.\n\nWhat followed four days later was a full-fledged campaign with identical tweets from leading sportswomen and tweets on the hashtag by several Union ministers and party supporters.\n\nThe \u201cnews\u201d of leading sportswomen lauding \u2018PM Modi\u2019s efforts to empower women\u2019 is now shared by media outlets.\n\nThis entire episode of headline management is embarrassing to say the least and to pull in national sportspersons in political propaganda of this nature is condemnable.", "lang": "en"}
