Through this article let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nFact: The sand sculpture is the creation of a sand artist from Odisha. The same image was posted by the artist on his Facebook profile. In correspondence with AFP, he acknowledged that the particular work is his own creation. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nReverse image search of the photo in the claim led us to a Facebook post by Sn Art Sadananda in which he shared the same image alongside the caption \u2018SAND ART Today live portrait try\u2019. His timeline is full of artworks like sand sculptures, watercolour painting, wall paintings etc. which he claimed to be of his own creation.\n\nWhen the same image went viral in Sri Lanka attributing the work to a young boy elsewhere in Sri Lanka, AFP debunked the news. In its fact-check article, AFP confirmed that in their correspondence with Sn Art Sadananda through Facebook messenger, he acknowledged that the particular work is his own creation.\n\nTo sum it up, the sand sculpture of the boy in the claim is the creation of a sand artist from Odisha, not by the young boy himself.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
