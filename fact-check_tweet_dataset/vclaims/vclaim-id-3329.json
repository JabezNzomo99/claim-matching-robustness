Did Beverly Young Nelson admit she \u201cforged\u201d a yearbook message from Moore?\n\nA: No. The first two names are not among Moore\u2019s accusers. And Nelson said she added a date and location to a yearbook message written by Moore.\n\nThe news cycle surrounding the Dec. 12 special Alabama Senate election between Republican Roy Moore and Democrat Doug Jones has been dominated by stories about accusations of sexual misconduct made against Moore, the former chief judge of the state\u2019s Supreme Court.\n\nThe first accusations surfaced in early November, when four women told the Washington Post that Moore had pursued them decades ago, when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. Since then, five more women have come forward with similar stories about Moore, who denies the allegations.\n\nSeveral stories circulating online about Moore\u2019s accusers aren\u2019t legitimate, and Facebook users rightly flagged them as potentially false. We found that some of them were purportedly written as satire, but were run on websites that did not label them as such.\n\nFlagged on: Daily Deals, Conservative Times, American Revolution and others.\n\nNone of the women who have come forward to accuse Moore of sexual misconduct is named Mary Lynne Davies.\n\nNevertheless, a bogus story claiming that an accuser with that name has been arrested for \u201cfalsification\u201d has been shared more than 15,000 times on Facebook.\n\nThe fake story originated on a website called No Fake News Online, which is part of a network of self-described satirical websites.\n\nA disclaimer on nofakenews.online says: \u201cEverything on this website is fiction.\u201d\n\nBut several unaffiliated websites that carry no such disclaimer have also posted the story \u2014 one of those sites is registered to an owner in Serbia\n\nThe bogus article actually combines details from the accounts given by two of Moore\u2019s real accusers \u2014 Leigh Corfman, who alleges that Moore touched her sexually when she was 14 and he was 32, and Beverly Young Nelson, who alleges that Moore attempted to force her into having sex in his car when she was 16 and he was in his 30s.\n\nThe story also refers to the Alabama attorney general as \u201cJohn Simmons,\u201d when the state\u2019s real attorney general is Steve Marshall.\n\nAnd the picture of a woman\u2019s mugshot that was published with the story is from a 2015 drug arrest in Georgia, and is unrelated to the allegations made against Moore.\n\nFlagged on: American Life, Road Life, American News and others.\n\nThis is another completely bogus story about a fictional accuser that has been posted by at least a dozen websites and shared more than 100,000 times on Facebook.\n\nIt was originally published by the website Reagan Was Right, which belongs to the same network of pseudo-news publications as No Fake News Online.\n\nTwo of the sites that picked up the story (Pride of America and Road Life) and ran it without a \u201csatire\u201d disclaimer are registered to an owner in Kosovo, and another site (American Life) is registered to an owner in Kazakhstan.\n\nThe made-up story claims that \u201cHarley Hannah\u201d appeared on MSNBC and told \u201chost Dan Fitzpatrick\u201d that she didn\u2019t actually remember what Moore had done to her. But that is not the name of any of the women who have accused Moore publicly, nor is there record of a \u201cDan Fitzpatrick\u201d hosting a show on MSNBC. There is also no record of an interview with anyone named \u201cHarley Hannah.\u201d\n\nAnd the featured image in the story is actually a photo from a 2016 interview with a British reality television star, Charlotte Crosby.\n\nReagan Was Right also fabricated the story that invented Moore accuser \u201cHelen Marikova-Spindlesmith\u201d has \u201cadmitted to being paid more than $100K in cash from an anonymous source\u201d to make false claims about Moore.\n\nFlagged on: America News Hub, Silence Is Consent, Info USA News and others.\n\nBeverly Young Nelson is one of Moore\u2019s accusers, but she has not admitted to forging a note that she says Moore wrote in her high school yearbook in 1977.\n\nThat false claim was made in dozens of headlines and stories published after Nelson acknowledged adding text to the yearbook specifying the date and location of Moore\u2019s message. She still maintains the message itself was written and signed by Moore.\n\nA post on the Silence Is Consent blog, for example, wrongly says: \u201cBeverly Nelson, the woman who has accused GOP Senatorial candidate Roy Moore of sexual assault, has admitted that she forged his inscription inside her high school yearbook.\u201d\n\nShe has made no such admission.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Nelson originally attributed all of the yearbook inscription to Moore, who she said offered to sign her yearbook at a restaurant where she worked.\n\nIn a Nov. 13 press conference, Nelson said: \u201cHe wrote in my yearbook as follows: \u2018To a sweeter more beautiful girl, I could not say Merry Christmas, Christmas, 1977, Love, Roy Moore, Olde Hickory House.\u2019 And signed it \u2018Roy Moore, DA.'\u201d\n\nBut on Dec. 8, in an interview that aired on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d Nelson acknowledged that she \u2014 not Moore \u2014 wrote the date, \u201c12-22-77,\u201d and the name of the restaurant, \u201cOlde Hickory House,\u201d that appear after the signature in the yearbook.\n\nIn a press conference the same day, Gloria Allred, Nelson\u2019s attorney, said that her client made the additions \u201cto remind herself of who Roy Moore was and when and where Mr. Moore signed her yearbook.\u201d Allred, though, did not say when the notes were added.\n\nSeveral of the stories that made the false forgery claim referred to a story published on the conservative Breitbart website under the misleading headline: \u201cBombshell: Roy Moore Accuser Beverly Nelson Admits She Forged Yearbook.\u201d\n\nOthers were based on a Fox News story that was originally headlined: \u201cRoy Moore accuser admits she forged part of yearbook inscription attributed to Alabama Senate candidate.\u201d\n\nFox News changed the headline and its story to reflect that \u201cNelson admits to writing part of the inscription herself, rather than forging part of it,\u201d according to an update.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nMcCrummen, Stephanie and Reinhard, Beth. \u201cWoman says Roy Moore initiated sexual encounter when she was 14, he was 32.\u201d Washington Post. 9 Nov 2017.\n\nReilly, Mollie. \u201cMitch McConnell Tells Roy Moore To Leave Senate Race, Says \u2018I Believe The Women.\u2019\u201d Huff Post. 16 Nov 2017.\n\nKranz, Michael. \u201cAll the women who have accused Roy Moore of sexual misconduct.\u201d Business Insider. 4 Dec 2017.\n\nYoung Nelson, Beverly. \u201cText of Beverly Young Nelson\u2019s Accusation Against Roy Moore.\u201d New York Times. 13 Nov 2017.\n\nHenman, Ellie. \u201cDUMPED AND DONE: Charlotte Crosby \u2018crying all day\u2019 as she struggles to cope after being dumped by Stephen Bear just one day after finding out ex Gaz Beadle is having a baby.\u201d The Sun. 24 Aug 2017.\n\n\u201cText of Beverly Young Nelson\u2019s Accusation Against Roy Moore.\u201d New York Times. 13 Nov 2017.\n\n\u201cRoy Moore accuser speaks out just before Election Day.\u201d ABC News. 8 Dec 2017.\n\nScherer, Michael. \u201cRoy Moore accuser alters part of her account about inscription.\u201d Washington Post. 8 Dec 2017.\n\n\u201cRoy Moore accuser admits she wrote part of yearbook inscription attributed to Alabama Senate candidate.\u201d Fox News. 8 Dec 2017.", "lang": "en"}
