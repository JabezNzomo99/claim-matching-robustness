Let\u2019s defund one of the most important public institutions in our countries history. Let\u2019s have all badges removed and allow people to tend to their own safety and security. But before you do so, Let me tell you about the badge and the thousands of good men and women it represents.\"\n\nIt goes on to list several heroic police acts, such as running \"towards certain death as the Towers collapsed on 9-11\" and \"ran into the line of fire to save the people in the Pulse Night Club.\"\n\nBut there\u2019s no evidence Russell wrote it.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe couldn\u2019t find any official social media accounts or websites belonging to Russell in which he posted or released the statement, and he hasn\u2019t made any recent public appearances.\n\nThe quote doesn\u2019t appear to exist outside of unsourced social media posts. We could find no mention of the statement in any news reports, let alone that Russell said it.\n\nDespite Russell\u2019s photo in the post, and the user\u2019s claim that he said it, the quote ends with \"~unknown.\"\n\nIndeed, earlier iterations of the quote on Facebook say it\u2019s from an unknown writer.\n\nRussell, who played a corrupt Los Angeles detective in the 2002 film \"Dark Blue,\" has been incorrectly credited for phony quotes before, most of them having to do with politics. A widely circulated photo in which he appears to be wearing a pro-Trump t-shirt was doctored.\n\nBut the actor doesn\u2019t share much about his political beliefs, saying in a 2015 interview with the Daily Beast that he doesn\u2019t like espousing his political views publicly.\n\nIn the same interview, Russell criticized liberals and conservatives and called himself a \"hardcore libertarian.\"", "lang": "en"}
