The footage shows her describing Weinstein as \u201ca wonderful human being\u201d and \u201ca good friend.\u201d\n\nMichelle Obama did indeed once describe Weinstein as a \u201cwonderful human being.\u201d The footage and remarks included in those social media posts were authentic and unedited. However, many posts did not include an important piece of context \u2014 Obama made those remarks in 2013, four years before dozens of women first publicly accused Weinstein of rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment, and various other sexual improprieties. As a result, her praise of Weinstein should not be interpreted as an endorsement of his offenses.\n\nThe former first lady was speaking in the East Room of the White House on Nov. 8, 2013, at a Student Film Symposium. Towards the beginning of her speech, she emphatically thanked Weinstein for his role in \u201corganizing\u201d the event:\n\n\u201cI want to start by thanking Harvey Weinstein for organizing this amazing day. [Audience applauds]. Harvey. This is possible because of Harvey. He is a wonderful human being, a good friend, and just a powerhouse. And the fact that he and his team took the time to make this happen for all of you should say something, not about me or about this place, but about you [points to audience]. We are here because of you.\u201d\n\nWeinstein himself was present at the event, seated behind Obama while she spoke:\n\nThe official transcript of Obama\u2019s full remarks can be read here. The Obama White House website described the event as providing high school students from Washington D.C., Boston, and New York \u201can opportunity to learn about animation, special effects, makeup, costume, directing, music and sound effects, and heard from leaders in the film industry about how their education helped them succeed.\u201d\n\nParticipants in the event included Whoopi Goldberg, Blake Lively, Naomie Harris, and \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d host Gayle King.\n\nBefore beginning her college education at Harvard University in the fall of 2017, the Obamas\u2019 eldest daughter Malia worked as an intern for the Weinstein Company, according to news reports and court records. That was before October 2017, when dozens of women first began to come forward to publicly accuse the influential producer of a range of sexual offenses across several decades, including rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment.\n\nAlthough Weinstein\u2019s behavior had been the subject of rumor and speculation within the film industry for several years, it seems unlikely that the Obamas had full knowledge of the allegations against him, given Malia\u2019s work placement just months before those stories first broke publicly. In light of Michelle Obama\u2019s glowing tribute to Weinstein in November 2013, it seems equally unlikely that she was aware of his offenses at that time. We contacted the office of Barack and Michelle Obama, asking when the former first lady first became aware of those allegations, but we did not receive a response in time for publication.", "lang": "en"}
