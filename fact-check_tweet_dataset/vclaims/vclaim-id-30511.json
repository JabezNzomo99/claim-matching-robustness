There\u2019s little evidence that the Conservatives\u2019 poll lead has plummeted by this much, and no strong indication yet that the recent tax policy announcements from the Conservatives have had any effect on public opinion.\n\nThe paper quotes a recent opinion poll conducted by market researchers Survation at the end of last week, which put the Conservatives on 40% and Labour on 29% - an 11 point lead. The headline gets this slightly muddled, describing it as Theresa May plummeting by 11 points.\n\nIt then compares it to another poll from Tuesday last week, from researchers at ICM. It put the Conservatives on 46% compared to Labour\u2019s 25% - a 21 point lead.\n\nThat\u2019s a big difference over four days, but not one we can draw a trend from. ICM has already released another poll conducted over the weekend, showing a 21 point lead for the Conservatives.\n\nOpinion polling isn\u2019t an exact science, and companies use different methods to measure public opinion. ICM and Survation have different approaches in how they adjust their findings to account for people\u2019s likelihood to vote, deal with \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 responses and make their findings representative of the UK population.\n\nFor that reason, polling expert Anthony Wells of YouGov advises caution in comparing two specific polls:\n\n\u201cOne should only compare polls from the same company conducted using the same methodology \u2013 otherwise it\u2019s just as likely that any difference is down to different methodological approaches\u201d.\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s no way to know if the different polls\u2019 findings represent a genuine change in public opinion, or just an effect of different polling practices.\n\nEven if two companies used exactly the same methods, polls are only ever estimates of public opinion and always have a margin of error.\n\nThe forest, not the trees\n\nEven though pollsters use different methods, it still helps to look at what multiple polls are saying \u2013 and how closely they agree \u2013 to get a general picture of what the public thinks.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in whether a series of announcements in the past week on foreign aid spending, protection for pensioners and tax rises have affected the Conservatives' poll ratings, you\u2019ll have to wait a little longer for a robust indication of it.\n\nMost polls from different companies since the start of April generally agree the Conservatives are ahead by roughly 19 or 20 percentage points. But there\u2019s still some variation: Opinium recently put the lead at nine percentage points, ComRes has it at 25. Again, all these polls will have a margin of error.\n\nWe can expect to see more polls this week asking people\u2019s views following the policy announcements, so we might see some indication then if the gap between the parties is narrowing. Even then, it would be difficult to pin down the cause.\n\nCan the polls be trusted?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say yet. The polls at the last general election underestimated the Conservatives\u2019 lead, and companies have been adapting their methods since then. \u201cThe election will be a chance to see whether these changes have been enough to stop the historical overestimation of Labour support, or indeed whether they\u2019ve gone too far and resulted in a pro-Tory skew\u201d, says Anthony Wells.", "lang": "en"}
