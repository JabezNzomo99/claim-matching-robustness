A fact check by Spanish website Maldito Bulo (Maldita.es )confirmed that the image was old and the incident happened in Spain, not Italy. Also, the person seen in the image is a woman, said the article. It is not clear what drove the woman to take the step.\n\n\n\nThe Maldita article mentions that the incident took place on December 24, 2019, as confirmed to them by National Police, Valencia. The first Coronavirus death outside China was reported from Philippines in February this year, and the first case of COVID-19 death in Europe was reported from France on February 15, 2020.\n\nAlso read Croatia Earthquake Pics Peddled As Italy Overwhelmed With COVID-19 Patients\n\nBack in December 2019, the same image had gone viral falsely claiming it to an incident wherein a man committed suicide due to 'gender violence law'.
