The viral text associated with the video reads, \u201cTreeplantationdrivewasstartedbyPakPMImranKhan. Look how namazi people oppose it becuase it\u2019s un!slam!c. Planting tree is against the faith.\u201d\n\n\n\nRight-wing author Renee Lynn claimed that Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan \u201ccopying\u201d his Indian counterpart started a tree plantation drive but locals uprooted the trees because they consider it \u201cagainst Islam\u201d.

Poonia\u2019s tweet gained over 8,000 retweets.\n\nPakistani Canadian author Tarek Fatah wrote in foul language that \u201cjihads\u201d uprooted saplings to practice \u201ckilling infidel kaafirs\u201d.\n\nWhich begs the eternal question:\n\n How does one country produce so many rectums? Just how does Pakistan do it?\n\npic.twitter.com/ADNkdmvrR9 IPS officer Dipanshu Kabra quote-tweeted Solheim and wrote, \u201cEven God can\u2019t bless a nation where extremist thinks, \u201cTree Plantation is \u201cAnti-Islam\u201d All religions preach that \u201cWe the people of Earth, must respect & protect all living beings and embrace our relationship with the environment. Our deepest sympathies with @ImranKhanPTI.\u201d Kabra later deleted his tweet. Ravinder Sangwan posted the viral video on Facebook with the same narrative. It gained over 6,700 shares. Alt News performed a keyword search \u2018plantation Pakistan uproots trees\u2019 and found an August 9 report by The News, a Pakistan-based website. The article includes a video of a news bulletin that shows the viral video. The outlet also tweeted the article. Locals uproot trees of PTI lawmaker's plantation campaign in Khyber over land dispute#TheNews As per the report, the chaotic incident took place at the Mandi Kas area in Khyber Agency in Pakistan. Newly-planted trees were uprooted by locals over alleged \u201cforceful plantation on private land\u201d. The tree plantation drive was an initiative by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf member Iqbal Afridi as a part of Pakistan\u2019s 10 Billion Tree Tsunami, a nationwide plantation drive. On August 9, PM Khan had organised the \u201cbiggest\u201d plantation drive in the country with the goal to plant at least 35 lakh trees. I want everyone to join me tomorrow, 9 Aug, in planting trees all over Pak. Have asked my MPs, ministers, Chief Ministers and Tiger Force to participate in the biggest tree planting campaign in our history. The target is 35 lakh trees in a day though we will try to exceed it. Afridi admitted that the plantation campaign in Mandi Kas had been carried out on private property. He told The News, \u201cThe locals were angry over the unauthorised tree plantation campaign. We\u2019re trying to have negotiations with them.\u201d Speaking to Dawn, a district administration official said that there was a dispute between two powerful tribes over the ownership of the land. \u201cOne of the parties was present when the campaign was inaugurated, while the other was unaware about the drive and uprooted the saplings,\u201d he said. Riaz Ghafur, a former faculty member at Edwardes College Peshwar, had tweeted the viral video condemning the incident. He subsequently shared another video where people can be seen planting trees. Ghafur told Alt News that the elders of the tribe which did not oppose the plantation drive later planted trees on the same land. Thus, social media claim that people in Pakistan opposed a tree plantation campaign because it is \u201cunIslamic\u201d to plant trees is ridiculous and false.", "lang": "en"}
