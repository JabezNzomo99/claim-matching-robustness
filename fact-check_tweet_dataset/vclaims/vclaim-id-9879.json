A story that said as much went viral again on April 1, 2018 but it was just a copy pasted version of an April Fools' Day hoax that ran last year so it still wasn't true this year.\n\nThe copy of the false story reappeared on April 1, 2018 on Tetribe.net and was titled \"First 90 Kangaroos Have Been Released in Wyoming\" (archived here). The copied article opened:\n\n(Dubois, Wyo) - The Wyoming Wild Game Department (WWGD) partnering with the Wyoming Migration Initiative (WMI) have released the first of 5 planned batches of 90 Antilopine Kangaroos into the Wyoming outdoors. Dubbed \"Project Sage Hopper\" by the WWGD team responsible for evaluating the viability of Wyoming's habitat for Australian marsupials, it has been in the planning stages for 3 years. The goal is two-fold: Create new and interesting wildlife viewing opportunities for tourists, and in several years, potentially provide additional hunting opportunities. \"Antilopine means 'antelope-like, so we are interested to see how these kangaroos adapt to Wyoming's wild landscapes,\" WMI Director Matt Kauffman said. \"If they start migrating, we'll be tracking their movements, looking to see how they learn to exploit the sage steppe and the mountains, where they 'hopover,' those sorts of things.\"\n\nThe story was an exact copy of this County10 story from last year:\n\nThat story was later updated with a big link that simply read\n\nand which directed visitors to a page with reactions about the prank.\n\nWe wrote about tetribe.net before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: This Small Canadian Town Will NOT Give Land & Job To Anyone Willing To Move There\n\u2022 Fake News: E-Cigarettes NOT Found To Have 10 times More Cancer Causing Ingredients Than Regular Cigarettes\n\u2022 Fake News: People With RH Negative Blood ARE From Earth And ARE Definitely Human\n\nThe website tetribe.net seems to be part of a wider trend of fake Native American themed websites that publish rehashed content from variouis other websites, including articles about actual Native American issues but also fake news and health scares.
