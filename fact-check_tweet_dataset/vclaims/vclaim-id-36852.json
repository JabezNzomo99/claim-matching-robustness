Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said they fired the missiles in retaliation against the U.S. for the killing of Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani in a Jan. 3 drone strike, according to The New York Times.\n\nA viral post falsely alleges that three images show Iranian missiles from that Jan. 7 attack either being launched or hitting a target. The post has been shared more than 14,000 times.

The IRGC released the photo of three missiles launching simultaneously Oct. 1, 2018, according to the Military Times.\n\nThe bottom-left image doesn\u2019t show missiles from the Jan. 7 attack against bases housing U.S. service members in Iraq either. The photo, which Iran\u2019s state TV made available to the European Pressphoto Agency, appears to show a June 2017 Iranian missile attack on an Islamic State-controlled town in Syria, according to The Guardian.\n\nTaken in November 2019, the bottom-right image shows a \u201cball of fire\u201d seen in the sky following an Israeli airstrike in the southern Gaza Strip, per its caption. Photographer Abed Rahim Khatib took the photograph for Agence France-Presse, according to Getty Images.\n\nUnverified and false information about Iran\u2019s attack on the two military bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq have been widespread on social media, according to Buzzfeed News.", "lang": "en"}
