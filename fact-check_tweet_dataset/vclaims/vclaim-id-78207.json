Stipends range from $9,000 for lower leadership posts to the $41,500 stipend collected by Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan. Committee chairs receive stipends. Vice chairs do not.\n\nA senator can receive only one stipend.\n\nSenate staffers send documents to the New York State Comptroller\u2019s Office each year listing the leadership position for which each senator should be paid his or her stipend.\n\nPolitiFact New York obtained the documents through Freedom of Information requests for each year starting in 2006. The Comptroller\u2019s Office keeps the documents for only five years, so it provided documents from 2012 to this year. The Senate provided documents from 2006 through 2011.\n\nThe documents show the practice of giving a committee chair\u2019s stipend to a different member of that committee did not start until 2015. The stipends went to the chairs from 2006 through 2014, unless the chair was paid for a different leadership position. The chair\u2019s stipend was not paid to anyone in those cases.\n\nTwo lawmakers were paid for committee chairmanships they did not hold in 2015 and 2016.\n\nSen. David Valesky was paid the $15,000 stipend of Health Committee Chairman Kemp Hannon. At the time, Hannon collected a $25,000 stipend as assistant majority leader on conference operations.\n\nSen. Andrew Lanza was paid the $18,000 stipend of Codes Committee Chairman Michael Nozzolio, who received $22,000 as the Senate\u2019s majority whip.\n\nValesky and Lanza were listed as vice chairs of the committees.\n\nThe practice widened in 2017, when six senators were paid for chairmanships they did not hold. Each, except Sen. Patricia Ritchie, was listed as vice chair of the respective committee.\n\nSavino received the $18,000 stipend of the Codes Committee chair this year. Lanza, who now chairs the Codes committee, received a $19,500 stipend as assistant senate majority whip.\n\nRitchie, who chairs the Agriculture Committee, was instead paid the Health Committee chair\u2019s stipend this year \u2014 a $2,500 increase. Ritchie is listed as deputy vice chair of the Health Committee.\n\nSen. Thomas O\u2019Mara was paid $15,000 as vice chairman of the Transportation Committee. O\u2019Mara otherwise would have received a $12,500 stipend as the Environmental Conservation Committee chairman.\n\nSen. Patrick Gallivan of Elma received $18,000 as vice chairman of the Education Committee, $5,500 more than he would have been be paid for chairing the Crime Victims, Crime, and Correction Committee.\n\nSen. Pam Helming would have received a $12,500 stipend as vice chairwoman of the Crime Victims Committee, the amount Gallivan would have been paid had he not collected the $18,000 from his Education Committee post. Helming decided not to accept the payment.\n\nSen. Jose Peralta, in a twist, took a pay cut. He was paid $12,500 this year as vice chairman of the Energy and Telecommunications Committee. Documents show he was paid $14,500 as the Senate\u2019s minority whip last year, a post he no longer holds.\n\nSavino\u2019s spokesperson said the senator was talking about granting stipends to members in general, and not referring specifically to committee vice chairs taking the stipends left available by their committee chairs who took stipends from elsewhere.\n\nStipends have been paid to members for decades. The Legislature started paying stipends to committee chairs in 1976.\n\nBut Savino\u2019s statement came in reply to an interviewer's question about the stipends going to vice chairs. Viewers who watched the interview could not be expected to understand her comment as her spokesperson said it was intended.\n\nSavino said the practice of giving a committee chairman\u2019s stipend to the vice chair in the State Senate has been \"a legislative practice for decades.\"\n\nRecords from the state Comptroller\u2019s Office indicate otherwise. The practice did not happen any time in the last decade. It started in 2015. Records do not support Savino\u2019s statement.\n\nSavino's office issued a statement about our story after publication on July 10.\n\n\"It\u2019s amazing that an outlet which calls itself Politifact could take liberties with the truth and distort my words based on their \u2018perception\u2019 of an interview. Perception is not fact it is opinion, and the truth is that the fragment they plucked from my full statement is as true today as it was when I said it: The practice of the Senate issuing stipends to senators has been a legislative practice for decades. I never said vice chairs were, though they are certainly entitled to under the legislative law. In fact, every senator in our house is entitled to one allowance including every senator in the minority,\" Savino said in the statement.\n\nFor context, here's a transcript of the relevant portion of the interview we fact-checked:\n\nERROL LOUIS: For over a week now we\u2019ve been telling you about the controversy involving stipends paid to state senators for positions they do not technically hold. Critics have denounced the practice but Republicans and Independent Democratic Conference leaders say it\u2019s much ado about nothing. My first guest tonight is one of those senators. Democrat Diane Savino is a member of the IDC. She represents parts of Staten Island and southern Brooklyn and she got her stipend as role of vice chair of the senate codes committee. Welcome to the program, thanks for coming back down from Albany.\n\nSAVINO: Thanks for having me Errol, how are you?\n\nERROL LOUIS: Oh I\u2019m very good thanks. Tell me what a Vice Chair does. What\u2019s the idea?\n\nSAVINO: Well first I want to just reflect on how you opened this. For the past week apparently the Albany press corps has been obsessed with this. When you look at what\u2019s happening in the world, it\u2019s almost as if the world is going to hell in a handbasket. The president is on the verge of being accused of possible crimes where they\u2019re talking about impeachment, the stock market is collapsing today, but yet in Albany there seems to be an obsession with something that has been, in fact, a legislative practice for decades. And in fact when there was a question brought up about it, legal memos were presented and offered to the press to verify that was has been done has been consistent with legislative law and legislative practice for decades, the comptroller\u2019s office verified that that is in fact in legislative law and has been practiced for decades. So, I am mystified as to what the obsession is.\n\nOur ruling does not change.", "lang": "en"}
