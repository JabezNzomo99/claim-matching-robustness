The claim is misleading; in the full 2014 speech, it is clear that Harris was discussing the \u201cbad decisions\u201d made by 18-24 year olds to highlight efforts needed to reduce recidivism among young offenders.\n\n\u201cDemocrats: Kamala Harris will help us get young voters!! Kamala Harris on potential young voters (18 - 24): \u2018they are stupid\u2019,\u201d an August 12, 2020 post says.\n\nThe clip was also watched more than 50,000 times on YouTube and shared on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nAlthough Harris did refer to the 18-24 demographic as \u201cstupid,\u201d the remark was facetious. She made the quip during a May 2014 speech at the Ford Foundation while discussing the \u201cBack on Track\u201d initiative to reduce recidivism among young, non-violent offenders.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s focus on a specific population and see what we can do to re-enter them in a way that they don\u2019t reoffend,\u201d Harris, who at the time was California\u2019s attorney general, says around the 16 minute mark of the speech.\n\n\u201dWhen I was at Howard University and we were in college we were 18 through 24 and you know what we were called? \u2018College kids.\u2019 But when you turn 18 and you\u2019re in the system, you are considered an adult, period,\u201d she added.\n\nAttempting to lighten the mood, she joked, \u201cWhat else do we know about this population, 18 through 24? They are stupid. That is why we put them in dormitories. And they have a resident assistant. They make really bad decisions.\u201d\n\nHarris was underlining the difference in treatment between adulthood in the criminal justice system and in other parts of society, such as college, where the same demographic is treated as \u201ckids.\u201d\n\nHarris has repeatedly touted the \u201cBack on Track\u201d program as a \u201csecond chance\u201d and a way to \u201credemption\u201d for young offenders -- here, here, and here.\n\nOn August 11, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden picked Haris to be his running mate, drawing attention to her record and making her a target for disinformation.\n\nSearching social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle for \"Kamala Harris\" yields nearly 71 million Facebook results, roughly 80 times more than the week prior to her nomination.\n\nBiden\u2019s announcement capped a months-long search for a Democratic partner to challenge President Donald Trump in November.\n\nHarris is the third female vice presidential nominee for a major party, after the groundbreaking but unsuccessful runs of Democrat Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and Republican Sarah Palin in 2008.", "lang": "en"}
