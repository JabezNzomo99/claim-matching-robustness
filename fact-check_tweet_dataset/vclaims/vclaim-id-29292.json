Other Facebook users are believing it to be true and sharing the post. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be found here.\n\nClaim: Important message from RBI: \u201cPress \u2018cancel\u2019 button twice before inserting the card. If anyone has setup the key pad to steal your PIN code, this will cancel that setup.\u201d Fact: No such instruction has been given by RBI. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched for \u2018RBI ATM Instructions\u2019 on Google, a link to RBI FAQ section on ATMs can be found in the search results. According to the information provided on that webpage, there is no specific instruction regarding pressing \u2018cancel\u2019 button twice to secure an ATM transaction. There is a precaution regarding extra device connected to ATM machines but nothing related to the claim made in the post. Also, when checked for any such instruction on RBI\u2019s Twitter page, no instruction was found.\n\nA similar claim was made last year in India and other countries by many users on Facebook which was debunked by many fact-checkers, like Snopes and Africa Check, across the world.\n\nFinally, RBI did not specify any such instruction for securing an ATM transaction.", "lang": "en"}
