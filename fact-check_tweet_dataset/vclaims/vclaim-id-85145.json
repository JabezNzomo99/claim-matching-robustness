We decided to take our own look at the facts, given this new ad.\n\nBut the gap decreases to 17 cents when looking at weekly wages. The gap decreases to 15 cents when you look at hourly wages. But not every wage earner is paid on an hourly basis, so this calculation excludes salaried workers. Further, this figure does not take into account other income categories, including people who work a part of the year (i.e., teachers).\n\nThe Free Beacon used data from Senate expenditure reports from 2002 to 2008, looking at annual salaries of staffers who were paid for an entire fiscal year of work. Part-time staffers were not included. Based on the outlet\u2019s calculation, the median pay for men was $56,499.93 and women was $40,791.55, or 72 percent of the men\u2019s median pay.\n\nThe Clinton campaign pushed back against this analysis, saying it excludes pay data for full-time Senate office staffers who also worked for a congressional committee or pro-Clinton political groups (Friends of Hillary, Hill PAC, Hillary Clinton for President). Since Clinton was running for president in 2007 and 2008, her staffers had worked for affiliated groups when they were not doing official Senate work, the campaign told PunditFact.\n\nPunditFact wrote: \u201cThe campaign argues this is a better picture of a staffer\u2019s annual earnings, as some staffers took time away from official duties to join in Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign efforts in 2007 and 2008. Huma Abedin, for example, earned $20,000 in 2008 as a senior adviser on Clinton\u2019s Senate staff, but she also made $150,000 working on the campaign that year, too.\u201d\n\nOddly, and without an explanation, the Clinton campaign declined to provide us salary data that they sent to FactCheck.org and PunditFact. We obtained a copy from PunditFact and spot-checked salaries to make sure they were consistent with congressional staff salaries published in LegiStorm. The salaries in the Clinton campaign database, like magic, show exactly $40,000 in median pay for both men and women from 2002 to 2008. (We wondered: Too good to be true?)\n\nThe writer of the Free Beacon article, Brent Scher, said: \u201cI stand by my initial report, and the methodology was explained in both the piece and to factcheck.org when I spoke with them a year and a half ago. The Clinton campaign confirmed that our data was accurate and I stand by the methodology we used.\u201d\n\nNorm Ornstein, congressional pay expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said numbers used in the Free Beacon article \u201creally are faulty comparisons.\u201d Disbursement reports from the Secretary of the Senate show people who worked in the office during the quarterly pay period, and do not capture how employees move between staffs, he said.\n\n\u201cBecause staffers cannot do campaign work or political work while on the senate payroll, they will often move back-and-forth, sometimes month-to-month, sometimes for a partial period, between the senate payroll and the campaign payroll,\u201d Ornstein said. \u201cAlso, senators may move staffers back and forth for different reasons or split payroll between committee staffs and their personal staffs.\u201d\n\nCalculating median Senate staff salaries does not take into account the different state offices that the staffers worked in at the time, said Mark Harkins, senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute and expert in congressional structure and operation. It\u2019s not an apples-to-apples measure to compare the salary of a staffer in Clinton\u2019s Manhattan office with that of a staffer in a more rural part of New York state, he said.\n\nThis ad claims that Clinton\u2019s push for equal pay practices for women and men is hypocritical because she did not pay female and male staffers equally when she was a U.S. senator. The ad uses data analyzed by the Washington Free Beacon, which did not include data of employees who worked for Clinton\u2019s congressional committees or her political campaign.\n\nThe Free Beacon\u2019s analysis is one method to calculate the Senate staff salaries, but another is the one that the Clinton campaign provided to our friends at PunditFact and FactCheck.org. The campaign showed salaries of employees who work for the Senate office, the congressional committee and political groups affiliated with Clinton and her presidential campaign in 2007 and 2008. When using that data, the median wage for men and women in her employ was equal.", "lang": "en"}
