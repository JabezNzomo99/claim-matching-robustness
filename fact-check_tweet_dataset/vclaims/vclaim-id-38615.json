A case has been registered in the local Kannad Police Station over the brawl and more details are awaited.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading posts (L) and the ABP Majha video (R):\n\nThe incident was also reported by other local media, including The Times of India newspaper here and the TV channels Zee 24 Taas and TV9 Marathi here and here.\n\nAFP also found this police record of the same incident on the website of Maharashtra Police.
