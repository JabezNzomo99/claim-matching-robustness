Others have shared the video on their timeline without specifying that it is old and has no connection to Karnataka.\n\nHowever, this particular video was widely covered by the media last year and can be easily found on YouTube. The video was taken during the PM's mega rally in his constituency Varanasi ahead of assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, which the BJP won in a landslide victory.\n\nThe below video uploaded by ABP News on March 4, 2017 states that the prime minister was given a rousing reception as his convoy passed through a Muslim dominated area in Varanasi.\n\nPrime minister Modi has been in Karnataka since May 1st launching a blistering attack as his party seeks to wrest control of the state from the incumbent Congress party. The prime minister's speeches in Karnataka have attracted huge footfalls, however, the video shared by many netizens is not from the state.", "lang": "en"}
