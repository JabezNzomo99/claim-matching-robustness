People often know the name of a disease, such as measles, but not the name of the virus that causes it (rubeola).\u201d\n\nDuring the pandemic of 2020, most everyone was familiar with the name of the coronavirus disease that was sweeping across multiple countries (COVID-19), but less so with the name of the virus that caused it (SARS-CoV-2). In either case, many people weren\u2019t aware of the derivations of those names, leading some to take japes like the following seriously:\n\nThe claim in the above meme is false. The true origins of the names of the coronavirus behind the 2020 pandemic and the disease stemming from it are rather straightforward, however.\n\nThe International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) announced \u201csevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)\u201d as the name of the newly discovered virus on Feb. 11, 2020. As the WHO observed, \u201cThis name was chosen because the virus is genetically related to the coronavirus responsible for the SARS outbreak of 2003. While related, the two viruses are different.\u201d\n\nOn the same day, the WHO announced \u201cCOVID-19\u201d as the name of the new disease caused by that virus. The first part of that name is a shortening of the phrase \u201ccoronavirus disease,\u201d and the latter part reflects that the disease was first reported in the year 2019.\n\nAlthough the strange new pneumonia of unknown cause first appeared in a cluster in Wuhan, China, nothing about the name of that illness or the virus that causes it reflects a geographical origin. The notion that the name COVID-19 stands for \u201cChinese Originated Viral Infectious Disease\u201d and reflects that it is caused by the \u201c19th virus to come out of China\u201d is nothing more than a bad joke.", "lang": "en"}
