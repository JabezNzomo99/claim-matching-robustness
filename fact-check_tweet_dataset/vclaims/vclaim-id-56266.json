The same post has been shared in several different countries without specific details about the alleged robberies\n\nThe post, which has been shared more than 1,700 times, claims criminals are pretending to be part of a local government initiative to distribute face masks. The claim came amid the public health agencies in numerous countries recommending people wear face masks in public to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\n\u201cThey ask you to please put it on to see if it fits. It\u2019s doused with chemicals which knocks you out cold,\u201d alleges the post. \u201cThey then rob you!! Please DO NOT accept masks from strangers. Remember friends, it\u2019s a critical time and people are desperate, the crime rate will spike.\u201d\n\nHowever, the March 30 post does not offer specific dates or locations for the alleged robberies, and similarly vague claims have also circulated in other countries in recent weeks. Both are tell-tale signs of an internet hoax.\n\nNo news reporting about criminals using chemically treated face masks to knock people unconscious to rob them could be found online either.

For instance, Snopes previously rated hoaxes about drug-soaked business cards and drug-laced perfume samples false.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
