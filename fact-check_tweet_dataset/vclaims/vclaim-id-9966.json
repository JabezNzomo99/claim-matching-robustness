(See screenshot of a WhatsApp message below)\n\nThe below excerpt from an article published by DNA in 2006 summarizes what happened on the day.\n\n\"The TMC supremo started shouting at the top of her voice alleging that the administration had acted \u2018unconstitutionally\u2019 by preventing her from entering Singur where the Tata motors proposed to set up a small car factory. She was intercepted at Hooghly and sent back. Instigated by the leader\u2019s vociferous protest, party members swung into fury breaking chairs, tables, destroying the Assembly files, furniture and so on.\"\n\nAccording to an article in the Hindu, six MLAs from the Left Front, two staff of the assembly and two journalists were injured when members of both sides of the House came to blows.

(Watch from YouTube counter 4:10)\n\nRatan Tata's dream project, the small car, which eventually went on to be named 'Nano', originally proposed to be built in West Bengal in 2006 was jinxed from the start. The proposed project between Tata Motors Ltd. and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee led Communist Party of India (M) was eventually relocated to Gujarat following widespread violence and protests from agitating farmers. A line was finally drawn under the entire Singur fiasco when in August 2016 the Supreme Court set aside land acquisition and ordered the West Bengal state government to return land to all within 12 weeks.", "lang": "en"}
