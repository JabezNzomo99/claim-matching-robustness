So demeaning, elitist, and out-of-touch it\u2019s appalling.\u201d\n\nHer post was retweeted by Donald Trump Jr., son of President Donald Trump. The younger Trump added: \u201cBloomberg wouldn\u2019t last 3 seconds as a farmer\u2026 you can tell he really hates regular hardworking Americans. He will never fight for them because he couldn\u2019t care less about them.\u201d\n\nIn the clip, Bloomberg can be heard saying: \u201cI could teach anybody \u2014 even people in this room, no offense intended \u2014 to be a farmer. It\u2019s a [process]: you dig a hole, you put a seed in, you put dirt on top, add water, up comes the corn.\u201d\n\nLater, he contrasts the nature of that work with that of the \u201cinformation economy\u201d: \u201c[\u2026] The information economy is fundamentally different because it\u2019s built around replacing people with technology and the skill sets that you have to learn are how to think and analyze, and that is a whole degree level different. You have to have to have a different skill set, you have to have a lot more gray matter.\u201d\n\nThe 60-second clip, and Bloomberg\u2019s remarks, garnered widespread coverage and prompted an angry response from some right-leaning observers. In an interview with Fox News, South Dakota\u2019s Republican Gov. Kristi Noem accused Bloomberg of exhibiting \u201cpompous ignorance\u201d in his comments.\n\nThe video footage contained in Kelly\u2019s Twitter post, and subsequently shared widely online, was authentic and not doctored. Although clearly it was cut from a much longer video, its removal from its original context did not substantively alter its tone or sense, nor deprive the viewer of context which might significantly change or impinge upon their understanding of Bloomberg\u2019s remarks. As such, the claim that Bloomberg had said he could \u201cteach anybody to be a farmer\u201d and that information technology work required \u201cmore gray matter\u201d was accurate.\n\nThe original video was recorded at the University of Oxford\u2019s Sa\u00efd Business School on Nov. 17, 2016. Bloomberg appeared there as part of the school\u2019s \u201cDistinguished Speaker Seminar Series.\u201d The full video can be viewed on YouTube, below.\n\nWhen he made his remarks about farming and technology, Bloomberg was responding to a question, placed by an audience member, about the role of business leaders in addressing or alleviating public perceptions of economic inequality, especially in the context of Trump\u2019s 2016 election victory, which had taken place only days earlier.\n\nThe following is a complete transcript of that question, and Bloomberg\u2019s full response. The segment shown in the 60-second clip is in bold type:\n\nEwen Hollingsworth: Ewen Hollingsworth, doing my MBA here. Mr. Bloomberg, Trump got in on a great sense of inequality, not just in the United States but across the world. There\u2019s been a divide, and there\u2019s an increasing divide, between the haves and the have-nots. What do you think business leaders \u2014 what\u2019s their responsibility to addressing that divide and uniting, perhaps, the central America [read: \u2018Middle America\u2019] and the coasts? Mike Bloomberg: Well, number one, I question whether you\u2019re right. We have, in the last four decades, cut poverty in half in the world, if you measure poverty by people who go to bed without a roof over their head, a meal in their stomach and [who] can\u2019t read. So society is making some progress. Life expectancy is going up, we\u2019re [inaudible] cure more diseases, and we\u2019re about to eradicate \u2014 thanks to [Bill] Gates and a little bit of money from us \u2014 eradicate polio. So we\u2019re doing some things to help. Number two, the bottom 20% is a lot better off than the bottom 20% in the past. The bottom 20% in America \u2014 the bottom 20% in New York City, 80% have cars, 30% have two cars, virtually everybody has a cellphone, they all have 72-inch TV screens and sort of thing. So there is some of this, so you\u2019ve got to be careful in this. And, incidentally, before we address the basic issue, if you measure poverty by the top 1% versus the bottom 20%, you get very different numbers than if you measure it by the two to 20% down from the top here, and the bottom 20%. Because of very low interest rates, you have inflated values of fixed assets, which are almost always owned by the very wealthy, and so, they\u2019ve shot up \u2014 maybe it\u2019s the top 5% \u2014 but if you adjusted for that, it\u2019s not as disparate as you would think. So that\u2019s what the real world is. We have a problem of income inequality, nevertheless. I would argue what\u2019s more important is we have educational inequality. There was a story on the front page of the FT [Financial Times] today, I think it was, that said there\u2019s nobody from the poor districts of London that comes to this great school, one of the great universities of the whole world, and zero from poor neighborhoods, at least I assume the statistics are right and they didn\u2019t just cherry-pick one neighborhood. So that is more important than net worth because that says what the future is going to be for the young people. Having said all of that, you can fix the inequality. You take money from the rich and you give it to the poor. We\u2019ve always done that, we have a tax system, generally, around the world, that is graduated at the top end, progressive tax system, takes more money from the rich per capita and redistributes it. Tuition in a university, in America certainly, is a Robin Hood plan. You want \u2014 the kids are always on the wrong side of that, they always want lower tuition, no you don\u2019t, you want to raise tuition in the university, as high as you can, so the wealthy will contribute more money, and then use the extra money to subsidize those kids who have no money. If you reduce the amount of money you take in from the rich, it\u2019s the poor that get hurt, not helped. So some of these things are a little bit counterintuitive. But you take the money from the rich, you give it to the poor, you do it for altruistic reasons, you do it because you don\u2019t want the poor on your doorstep and there are a variety of things. But I think what you\u2019ve got to understand is the people who are getting the subsidy want the dignity of a job. They want the dignity of being responsible for their family and being able to take care of it. And that\u2019s the conundrum we\u2019re going to have here because technology is reducing the ability to give them the jobs. We just \u2014 more and more, if you think about it, the agrarian society lasted 3,000 years, and we could teach processes. I could teach anybody \u2014 even people in this room, no offense intended \u2014 to be a farmer. It\u2019s a [process]. You dig a hole, you put a seed in, you put dirt on top, add water, up comes the corn. You could learn that. Then you have 300 years of the industrial society. You put the piece of metal on the lathe, you turn the crank in the direction of the arrow and you can have a job. And we created a lot of jobs. [At] one point, 98% of the world worked in agriculture, today it\u2019s 2%, in the United States. Now comes the information economy. And the information economy is fundamentally different because it\u2019s built around replacing people with technology, and the skill sets that you have to learn are how to think and analyze. And that is a whole degree level different. You have to have a different skill set, you have to have a lot more gray matter. It\u2019s not clear that teachers can teach or the students can learn. So the challenge for society is to find jobs for these people \u2014 who we can take care of giving them a roof over their head and a meal in their stomach, and a cellphone and a car and that sort of thing. But the thing that\u2019s the most important, that will stop them from setting up the guillotines some day, is the dignity of a job. And nobody\u2019s yet come up with a simple solution, in this day and age, to how we create jobs, particularly for people already out of school. I can tell you how to fix the school system so that the kids come out with better skills, more ability to appreciate life and to work collaboratively and collectively and read the instruction manual and follow orders. But it\u2019s very hard to figure out where the jobs they\u2019re going to get will come from, and for those that are already out in the work force, to get them back into the system and teach them new skill sets, is almost impossible. It\u2019s very very hard to do and nobody\u2019s really shown they could it. There\u2019s individual cases where you can retrain them, I don\u2019t want to overstate it. But the coal miner I talked about in West Virginia is not going to move, and his family, out to California where the solar jobs are, and even if he got there he\u2019s not going to get those jobs. Nobody\u2019s going to hire an older person. It\u2019s fascinating to me \u2014 older people are always willing to hire younger people; younger people are not willing to hire older people. I think it\u2019s just they\u2019re afraid of older people that may have skill sets they don\u2019t have, and you know, they make fun of them, they say they\u2019re not able to change and think \u2014 none of those things are true, there are plenty of older people who are really smart and really can do new things if you gave them the opportunity. But there\u2019s a discrimination from young managers to hire older people. It\u2019s reasonably well documented I think, and certainly observable. So your basic premise is, it\u2019s not that bad, it\u2019s better than it was before, but it\u2019s a big problem and the problem is not the redistribution of wealth, it is the job where you\u2019re going every day. And you say \u2018What\u2019s business\u2019s responsibility?\u2019 It\u2019s not business\u2019s job. Business\u2019s job is to take the investors\u2019 money and to maximize the money by creating products that the public wants and are willing to pay for. And you can\u2019t say to them they should go and create jobs deliberately. You can have a tax policy that encourages that, and that\u2019s one of the things you should do, and then use the collective wisdom of all of the heads of companies, to create small pockets, and it adds up to a lot of jobs. That\u2019s what I would do right away. Your taxes are lower the more people you hire, and higher the fewer people you hire. And let capitalism work, because government\u2019s not going to be able to solve the problem directly. But short of that, who\u2019s going to create the jobs? Well if it\u2019s not industry, there\u2019s only one group left to do it. And so the next time you want more efficient government, think twice. I\u2019m not so sure you do want more efficient government. Back in the \u201930s, we created an inefficient government. We put people to work building infrastructure we needed. They weren\u2019t maybe the \u2014 you could have had other people do it more efficiently but we wanted to create jobs and we did, and it took us \u2014 World War II was really what took us out of the Depression, but it got us through the Depression. And maybe that is the answer, that we\u2019re going to say \u2018government\u2019s got to create no-show jobs,\u2019 or jobs that you have to show but that aren\u2019t needed. We can pass a law that says you\u2019ve got to move all the paper from the left to the right side of the building every day, and back again. Okay. And then the government are going to hire people to do it. But it\u2019s better than people being out on the streets, desperate for a job, not being able to find it, [destabilizing] society.\u201d\n\nDespite the significant volume of words, Bloomberg\u2019s basic argument can reasonably be summarized as follows: Income inequality is not as chronic as it was in the past, but is still a significant problem. The primary cause for concern is educational inequality, and in particular the extent to which older people who previously worked in agriculture and in relatively low-skilled manual work can transition to participating in the information economy.\n\nAs an illustration of his broader point, Bloomberg presented farming as a relatively straightforward endeavor which \u201canybody\u201d could easily learn, and argued that, by contrast with farming and low-skilled manual labor (\u201cyou put the piece of metal on the lathe, you turn the crank in the direction of the arrow\u201d), taking part in the information economy required greater intelligence (\u201ca lot more gray matter\u201d) and different skill sets (\u201chow to think and analyze\u201d).\n\nKnowing the broader context in which Bloomberg uttered those remarks certainly enhances one\u2019s understanding and appreciation of them, but it does not alter their meaning or significance \u2014 Bloomberg was not speaking ironically, for example, or taking on the persona of someone else, when he made the comments in question. As such, those who quoted him did so both accurately and fairly, and did not misrepresent the meaning of his words.\n\nSnopes invited Bloomberg\u2019s presidential campaign to provide any background, context or additional information which might alter a viewer\u2019s understanding of his remarks, and we also asked whether Bloomberg still stood by his comments and the manner in which he expressed his arguments during the Oxford speech.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson said: \u201cMike wasn\u2019t talking about today\u2019s farmers at all,\u201d and highlighted the fact that Bloomberg mentioned \u201c3,000 years\u201d of the \u201cagrarian society.\u201d However, this claim does not comport with the fact that Bloomberg was clearly speaking in the present tense about farming and low-skilled industrial labor, and the present-day dilemma of how to provide a new skill set to \u201cthose that are already out in the work force.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
