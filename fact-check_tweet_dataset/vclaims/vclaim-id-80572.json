This comes amid a dispute between U.S. Soccer and the women\u2019s team over their collective bargaining agreement.\n\nThe Other 98 Percent\u2019s claim \u2014 that the women\u2019s soccer team made $20 million more for U.S. Soccer than the men yet were paid four times less \u2014 comes from news reports about the equal pay complaint, filed by players Carli Lloyd, Hope Solo, Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe and Becky Sauerbrunn.\n\nThe complaint itself does not claim either of these figures. Instead, it says more generally that the women\u2019s team has generated significant revenue and that women\u2019s national team members \"have been paid and continue to be paid substantially less than (men\u2019s national team) players.\" So we wanted to see if these numbers in The Other 98 Percent\u2019s graphic add up.\n\nWhile the women\u2019s team is projected to have brought in more revenue than the men\u2019s team for the 2016 fiscal year, it\u2019s not nearly as large a gap as The Other 98 Percent\u2019s image claims.\n\nLast year, U.S. Soccer projected the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams together would bring in about $24 million, and they ended up taking in about double that amount, according to financial documents released by the federation earlier this year.\n\nThe women\u2019s team brought in slightly more of that revenue: $26.8 million, including $3.2 million in World Cup revenue. The men brought in revenues totaling $21 million. But that\u2019s a difference of about $5.8 million, nowhere close to the $20 million cited in the graphic. (It\u2019s worth noting that expenses exceeded revenue for the women\u2019s World Cup, so that particular event resulted in net losses rather than profit for U.S. Soccer.)\n\nIn its report, the federation cited both teams\u2019 successes in contributing to the budget-busting revenue, but it singled out the women\u2019s team for its World Cup win and the nine-game victory tour that followed.\n\nFor the upcoming year, the federation predicts the women\u2019s team will bring in about $17.6 million in revenue, resulting in a net profit. The men\u2019s team, on the other hand, is expected to bring in about half of that, $9 million, and end up with net losses.\n\nWhile the women\u2019s team championship win was a leading factor in raising U.S. Soccer revenue beyond expectations, they brought in about $5.8 million more than the men\u2019s team, not $20 million.\n\nThe women\u2019s team players\u2019 complaint against U.S. Soccer highlights some perceived disparities in pay. But there\u2019s no way to easily compare the women with the men because their compensation agreements are drastically different. For example, women earn a $72,000 base salary and benefits like health insurance, while men are paid on a per-game basis and do not receive a salary or benefits.\n\nBut here are a few of the examples that the complaint raises:\n\u2022 Both teams play 20 exhibition games each year. Female players earn $1,350 for winning an exhibition game, while male players win $5,000 if they lose and up to $17,625 if they win, depending on the opponent\u2019s ranking.\n\u2022 For making the World Cup roster, female players earned $15,000 each, while male players made $68,750 each in their World Cup year.\n\u2022 For winning the World Cup, the women earned $2 million to split among the players. For losing in the round of 16, the men earned $9 million. (This bonus is determined by FIFA, the international soccer governing body, not U.S. Soccer.)\n\u2022 When traveling, the men\u2019s team receives approximately 25 percent more per diem cash than the women\u2019s team.\n\u2022 Players earn a bonus per ticket sold at their games. For women, that bonus is $1.20 per ticket, while it is $1.50 per ticket for the men.\n\nAs to whether all of this amounts to women players earning one-fourth what male players do \u2014 that\u2019s hard to say because compensation varies by player and year-to-year, depending on how many games they play and at what level of competition.\n\nWebsite FiveThirtyEight conducted its own analysis of the federation\u2019s financial documents, comparing the compensation of two male players to two female players of similar seniority in their respective World Cup years. FiveThirtyEight found that given those conditions, the men made almost twice as much as the women.\n\nThe FiveThirtyEight analysis concluded that women\u2019s team players Lloyd and Solo likely made about $240,000 in 2015, the year they won the World Cup. But men\u2019s team players Clint Dempsey and Tim Howard made $428,000 and $399,000, respectively, in 2014 when they competed \u2014 but did not go very far \u2014 in the men\u2019s World Cup tournament.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the lawyer representing the five women, Jeffrey Kessler, has said that depending on the match, the women might be paid 28 percent to 65 percent less than the men.\n\nA U.S. Soccer spokesman told us that when comparing compensation and revenue for the men\u2019s team and the women\u2019s team needs to be looked at over a course of four or eight years cumulatively instead of just one year, as a small window does not provide the entire picture \u2014 since men and women play the signature tournament, the World Cup, in different years.\n\nAn image shared by The Other 98 Percent said \"Last year (the U.S. women\u2019s soccer team) generated $20 million more than the men\u2019s team and were paid almost four times less.\"\n\nThe women\u2019s soccer team had a much more successful season on the pitch than the men\u2019s team last year, and as a result they brought in a lot more revenue. But that gap is closer to $5.8 million, not $20 million.\n\nAnd while there seem to be compensation disparities among the women and men, it\u2019s hard to pin down exactly how big that disparity is because the way women and men are paid is so different, and it also varies by match and by player. We couldn't find a clear example of female players being paid one-fourth the amount their male counterparts earn.\n\nWhile there might be legitimate issues concerning the revenue and compensation ratio among the men\u2019s and women\u2019s soccer teams, this graphic uses numbers that are way off.
