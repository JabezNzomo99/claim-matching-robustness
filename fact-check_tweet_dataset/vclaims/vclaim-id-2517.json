Some mental health services are provided by other organisations.\n\nThey also point out that almost 90% of Clinical Commissioning Groups said they planned to increase their spending. These are the organisations that actually purchase the majority of mental health services.\n\nThe King\u2019s Fund has responded that \u201cmental health trusts provide a large proportion [about 80%] of mental health care\u201d and that there\u2019s \u201clittle evidence that demand for these services has fallen\u201d. So it \u201cseems likely\u201d that many CCGs are spending less than planned on mental health.\n\nIf money supposedly going into mental health care isn\u2019t all showing up on the books of the people who provide it, some of it must be being spent on something else.
