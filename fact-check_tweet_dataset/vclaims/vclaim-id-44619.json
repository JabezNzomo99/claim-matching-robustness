No, that's not true. The fake quote originated on a liberal satire website that tries to mislead Trump supporters and Republicans into sharing made up stories that are clearly marked as satire when you actually click them. Articles from the site are frequently copied by foreign-run fake news websites. The people liking and sharing these stories are enriching foreign website operators or a liberal from Maine via the ad revenue generated with the content which is probably not what they expected or wanted.\n\nThe quote first appeared in an article (archived here) where it was published by Taters Gonna Tate on October 12, 2019 under the title \"AOC:'Children Should Be Raised By The State'\". It opened:\n\nDemocrat spokesperson, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, continues to push her socialist agenda and now it's getting downright scary. Her latest genius plan is to socialize our children. That's right, apparently AOC feels that upon birth, the offspring of American families should be taken from their homes to be raised by the state \"so that they can do properly indoctrinated and become model citizens for a new and better American future.\" This is straight out of the Soviet playbook where children were routinely removed from households and molded into various roles for government. They were treated as possessions, not people, while families mourned.\n\nThe article appeared on a page with several satire disclaimers and logos and under a category that was named \"AOC is crazy! Simple satire for simple people\"\n\nThe site is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run by self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. He runs several websites and Facebook pages with visible satire disclaimers everywhere. They mostly publish made-up stories with headlines specifically created to trigger Republicans, conservatives and evangelical Christians into angrily sharing or commenting on the story on Facebook without actually reading the full article, exposing them to mockery and ridicule by fans of the sites and pages.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who omit the satire disclaimer and other hints the stories are fake. One of the most persistent networks of such sites is run by a man from Pakistan named Kashif Shahzad Khokhar (aka \"DashiKashi\") who has spammed hundreds of such stolen stories into conservative and right-wing Facebook pages in order to profit from the ad revenue.\n\nWhen fact checkers point this out to the people liking and sharing these copycat stories some of them get mad at the fact checkers instead of directing their anger at the foreign spammers or the liberal satire writers. Others send a polite \"thank you\" note, which is much appreciated.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes tatersgonnatate.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
