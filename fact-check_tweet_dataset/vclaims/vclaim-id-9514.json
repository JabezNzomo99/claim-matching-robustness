No response. Where is [the child] now? How is [the child]? Is [the child] even alive? How can we conclude that everything is fine over there? Let\u2019s compare to the Italians or French. Right now, the proportion of Italian adoptive parents is consistently high. And with France we have an entire commission yearly, when all cases are examined,\u201d Kuznetsova said.\n\nThe United States committed itself to share with Russia information concerning children adopted from Russia under an agreement on cooperation adopting children. The document also provided the basis for adopted children receiving optional dual Russian-American citizenship, thereby enshrining Russia\u2019s right to receive the information about the adopted children.\n\nThe document was signed on July 13, 2011 in Washington, DC and went into effect on November 1, 2012, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\nHowever, two months later, Russia adopted the so-called \u201cDima Yakovlev law,\u201d named after the Russian boy who died after his adoptive father left him in a closed car for hours. A court found the father not guilty, the father\u2019s lawyer calling the 2008 death \u201ca tragic accident.\u201d That law, which went into effect on January 1, 2013, banned unconditionally the adoption of Russian children by American citizens.\n\nRussia unilaterally terminated the bilateral adoption cooperation agreement, after adoption of the law.Only two weeks earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, had warned: \u201cIf we terminate it (the agreement) we will lose the legal ability to demand access to our children. If even only because of this, I\u2019d not go that far in our reaction.\u201d\n\nIn Russia, the \u201cDima Yakovlev law\u201d law is widely seen as a direct response to the \u201cMagnitsky Act,\u201d the U.S. law adopted in 2012 that imposes sanctions on Russian citizens involved in human rights violations.\n\nAdoption agreements between Russia and the two other countries mentioned by Kuznetsova, France and Italy, remain in effect governing the cooperation she described in the Pozner interview.\n\nThis past January the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled Russia\u2019s ban on the adoption of children by Americans discriminatory after investigating the appeals of the 22 American parents who had already started the adoption process in Russia but could not finalize it because of the ban. The ECHR ruled that the \u201cDima Yakovlev law\u201d violates the Article 14 of the European Convention of Human Rights.\n\nThe ECHR verdict was brought up during Vladimir Pozner\u2019s TV talk show, when the host asked Kuznetsova whether the ban is \u201ctied to politics\u201d or only to the fact that \u201cthe Americans do not respond to our requests\u201d for information about adopted Russian children. Kuznetsova replied: \u201cthe whole situation, including the political one, if that\u2019s what you mean, is flexible; flexible, depending on the evolving circumstances.\"\n\nThe \u201cDima Yakovlev law\u201d requires that prospective Russian adoptive parents be given priority over foreigners. Consequently the number of \u201cforeign adoptions\u201d in Russia has fallen from 4.2 percent of the total number of adoptions in 2012 to 1.3 percent in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe 2016 dynamics are such that more children remain in orphanages than are adopted and transferred to families,\u201d Anna Kuznetsova said.\n\nBefore the ban, the U.S. was second after Italy in the total number of adoptions of Russian children by foreigners, and first in terms of the number of disabled Russian children by foreigners.\n\nThe \u201cDima Yakovlev law\u201d states that it applies to nations that have banned entry to and seized the financial assets of Russian citizens involved in human rights violations.\n\nStill, Valentina Matvienko, the speaker of the Federation Council, the upper chamber of Russia\u2019s parliament, said this past January: \u201cRussia is ready for a dialogue with the United States over the so-called Dima Yakovlev law, which is not an end in itself. Given certain guarantees from the U.S., everything can be returned to normal.\u201d\n\nSix months later, in July the issue of adoptions was discussed by the presidents of Russia and the U.S. during their meeting on sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. However, Putin\u2019s press secretary Dmitry Peskov said repealing the \u201cDima Yakovlev law\u201d was \u201cout of the question.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
