The federal land transfer issue came into the national spotlight last year with the armed standoff between Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy and the Bureau of Land Management.\n\nLand conservation and land transfer advocates are expecting this issue to emerge in the presidential campaign, particularly in the swing states Colorado and Nevada (where the next GOP debate will be held). As the Las Vegas Review-Journal noted, the federal government owns more than 80 percent of land in Nevada. Carson\u2019s use of the word \u201creturning\u201d here reflects rhetoric used by some land transfer advocates and highlights a key policy issue at the heart of the debate \u2014 so we explored the facts underlying his answer.\n\nFirst of all, Carson is way off on the acreage: The federal government does not own 2.4 billion acres of land. The actual land mass of the United States is about 2.3 billion acres, and the federal government owns and manages about 640 million acres, heavily concentrated in 11 continental Western states and Alaska. The Forest Service, National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management and Fish and Wildlife Service administer about 95 percent of those lands.\n\nBut we don\u2019t play gotcha at The Fact Checker; Carson might have mixed up the U.S. land mass number with the acreage of land the government owns. His spokesman did not respond to our queries, but given his obvious mathematical error, we will focus on the more important policy issue.\n\n\u201cThe idea of \u2018returning\u2019 federal lands in the West to the states is a misnomer because those lands have never been owned by the states,\u201d Hays wrote. \u201cThe political context of the issue is two quite different systems of land management with different objectives, one by the states and the other by the federal government.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s some historical context: The issue comes down to whether the \u201cnew Western\u201d states should be given the same rights to federal land transfers as the original 13 states. The \u201cnew Western\u201d land was acquired through various treaties and purchases beginning with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and ending with the purchase of Alaska in 1867, according to the Congressional Research Service\u2018s 2012 overview on federal land ownership.\n\nIn the mid- to late-1800s, Congress passed laws to encourage the settlement of the West by disposing federal lands, according to CRS. Land transfer advocates also note that in the 1800s, then-Western states (which are states in the current Midwest/South) contributed to these land transfers by pressuring Congress.\n\nThrough the Property Clause, the U.S. Constitution gives Congress power to own land. Under the equal footing doctrine, all new states are entitled to the same powers of state government that belonged to the original 13 states. And those states operated under a federal policy of transferring ownership of federal lands to private and state ownership.\n\nBut in the context of federal land, the equal footing doctrine generally has not applied to federal land ownership, according to the CRS analysis. After many decades of debate over provisions in the equal footing doctrine and the Property Clause, Congress in 1976 passed a law declaring that \u201cthe remaining public domain lands generally would remain in federal ownership.\u201d (For more legal and historical context, check out Punditfact\u2019s fact-check on a related claim from 2014, and this 2007 CRS overview of the constitutional authority and history of federal land acquisition.)\n\nThis hasn\u2019t stopped Western states\u2019 efforts to push for the federal government to transfer land to the states. The 1976 law led to the beginning of the Sagebrush Rebellion, which peaked in the 1980s, an effort among state and local governments to force the federal government to divest itself of federal lands. But those efforts failed.\n\nWith the backing of the Koch-backed fundraising network, the American Lands Council has reinvigorated the land transfer movement in nearly every Western state, the Los Angeles Times reported earlier this year. \u201cEnabling acts\u201d created most Western states from territories, and states had to concede control of the land in exchange for statehood. But advocates point to a clause in the enabling acts that they say entitles states to have land transferred from the federal government, the L.A. Times reported. The American Lands Council also argues that transferring land to states will allow for a more \u201cthoughtful, more responsive and accountable stewardship\u201d of the lands.\n\nBut the bigger issue is that Carson repeats rhetoric that creates a misleading impression of how federal land ownership works. Words are important in this debate. While the the technical term is \u201cdispose,\u201d we agree that it sounds too much like jargon; a more acceptable phrasing would be \u201ctransfer.\u201d In calling for \u201creturning\u201d federal lands to states, Carson used rhetoric that distorts the historical context and various legal interpretations that are at play. Federal land ownership and the state-federal clash over the issue is complex and nuanced, and Carson\u2019s language blurs the underlying facts. That upped his rating to Two Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
