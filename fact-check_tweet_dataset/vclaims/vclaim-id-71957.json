A solid majority of them -- about 60 percent -- run as Republicans, so Schimel had a natural advantage vs. Happ.\n\nBut a fair number of law enforcement officials decline to endorse, so the advantage is not guaranteed.\n\nWe analyzed the endorsement lists of both candidates and here\u2019s what we found:\n\nCombined, Happ and Schimel claim 112 endorsements from current DAs and sheriffs. Schimel has received 80 percent of those endorsements. If you were to look at all sheriffs and DAs -- including those who have not issued endorsements -- his total of 89 would represent about 60 percent.\n\nSignificantly, Schimel won over nine Democrats and one independent.\n\nIn contrast, Happ\u2019s 23 endorsements were all from within her party -- not a single Republican official defected to her side.\n\nBottom line, Schimel started with a natural \"base\" of 60 percent, but wound up with 80 percent support from those who endorsed.\n\nSo, by that measure his \"overwhelming majority of Republican and Democrat law enforcement leaders\" claim holds up to scrutiny.\n\nBut his claim can also be read as a majority of Republicans and a majority of Democrats.\n\nBy that measure, he is accurate with Republicans, but not with Democrats. Of the 32 Democrats who have endorsed, Happ received 23 compared to Schimel\u2019s nine.\n\nFor Schimel, that is 28 percent of the nods from Democrats.\n\nThat\u2019s 28 percent more than Happ won from Republicans, but not a majority.\n\nSchimel\u2019s ad says that \"an overwhelming majority of Republican and Democrat law enforcement leaders have endorsed Brad Schimel.\"\n\nThe AG candidate has won 80 percent support from those who endorsed, and wooed 9 Democrats into the fold. He has won a clear majority overall, and from Republicans, but not from Democrats alone.\n\nThat makes for a partially accurate claim, our definition of Half True.", "lang": "en"}
