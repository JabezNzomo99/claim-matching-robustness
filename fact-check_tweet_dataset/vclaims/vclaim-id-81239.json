This ad attacks Cuccinelli for his uncompromising stance on gun rights, such as not supporting proposals that would close the so-called \u201cgun show loophole.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve previously noted that the data on guns purchased without background checks, including the often-repeated statistic that 40 percent of gun purchases lack a background check, is rather dated and often mischaracterized. When we dug into the data, some 20 years old, it turned out that the figure is actually between 14 to 22 percent. That\u2019s a big difference.\n\nMoreover, a 2004 study found that less than 2 percent of inmates incarcerated from crimes committed with handguns said they bought their gun at a gun show or a flea market. (The biggest sources by far were friends/family or \u201cthe street.\u201d)\n\nSeung-Hui Cho (2009): The Virginia Tech shooter purchased one gun from an online dealer and a second gun from a full-service gun dealer. In both cases, he passed the federal background check conducted for Virginia gun dealers by state police. Cho suffered from mental illness, and a better record-keeping for mental health records might have prevented him from buying guns. The Manchin-Toomey bill to tighten gun-show sales, which failed in the Senate this year, would have pushed states to put the records of prohibited purchasers into the federal system; in theory, that law might have prevent Cho from buying guns, but the ad does not mention that provision of the bill.\n\nJames Holmes (2012): The shooter at a cinema in Aurora, Colo., legally purchased guns \u2014 two Glock 22 pistols, a Remington 870 shotgun and a Smith & Wesson semi-automatic rifle \u2014 at three Colorado gun stores, after being approved via the federal background check system. He also purchased thousands of rounds of ammunition over the Internet.\n\nIn other words, none of these tragedies would have been prevented by closing the gun-show loophole, but a small case might be made that maintaining better records on mentally ill people might have made a difference.\n\nThe ad is also a bit confusing because when it mentions that Cuccinelli opposed closing the gun show loophole, it cites a 2008 Richmond Times-Dispatch article concerning a vote on a gun-control bill in the Virginia legislature \u2014 not the more recent federal legislation.\n\n\u201cThe images of the killers is over the language that says \u2018the dangerously mentally ill, criminals,'\u201d said Stu Loeser, a spokesman for Bloomberg and the PAC. \u201cWe never say those killers got their guns from gun shows and that the background check would have prevented them in particular. They are there as representatives of killers and mentally ill people, which is what the script is saying.\u201d\n\nEmotional attack ads need to be scrupulous with the facts. While this ad does not identify the killers, the images are so familiar to Americans that many should be able to identify at least one of them.\n\nWe have a reasonable-person test here. Most viewers would assume the gun-show loophole would have thwarted all of these attacks, but that\u2019s not the case. Thus it is misleading to use these images in the ad.", "lang": "en"}
