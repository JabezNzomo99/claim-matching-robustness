But what we do know is we\u2019ve stopped \u2014 CBP has stopped over 3,000, what we call, special-interest aliens trying to come into the country on the southern border. Those are aliens who the intel community has identified are of concern. They either have travel patterns that are identified as terrorist travel patterns, or they have known or suspected ties to terrorism.\u201d\n\nTrump warns about dangerous criminals, but the numbers he\u2019s citing involve a mix of serious and nonviolent offenses such as immigration violations. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement reports yearly arrest totals without breaking down the type of offense, which could be anything from homicide to a DUI to illegal entry. In a letter sent to members of Congress, Trump switches quickly from the 235,000 arrests over two years to a different statistic, charges and convictions: \u201croughly 100,000 for assault, 30,000 for sex crimes, and 4,000 for homicides.\u201d That gives a muddled picture.\n\nNielsen included this number in a presentation to members of Congress on \u201cborder security,\u201d but she did not break down how many of these people showed up at airports vs. land crossings. Trump administration officials have claimed before that an average 10 individuals per day at the border have ties to terrorism, but the figure they point to includes people trying to fly into the country. A border wall obviously would make no difference in those cases. (We gave this 10-terrorists-a-day figure Four Pinocchios.)\n\nAs of July 2017, the State Department said there was \u201cno credible information that any member of a terrorist group has traveled through Mexico to gain access to the United States.\u201d According to separate DHS data for 2017, most of the 2,554 people on the terrorist watch list who were encountered by U.S. officials tried to enter through airports (2,170) or by sea (49).\n\nBersin also testified that \u201cthe majority of individuals that are traveling, be they from special interest alien countries or other places, we found the large majority of these individuals are actually fleeing violence from other parts of the world, but of course, we have to be very vigilant and we are looking at those individuals that might actually pose a threat and when we do, we actively work with these governments to respond.\u201d The GAO report said \u201csome Mexican drug trafficking organizations specialize in smuggling special-interest aliens into the United States.\u201d\n\nAn analysis by the libertarian Cato Institute found: \u201cZero people were murdered or injured in terror attacks committed on U.S. soil by special interest aliens who entered illegally from 1975 through the end of 2017. However, seven special interest aliens who initially entered illegally have been convicted of planning a terrorist attack on U.S. soil. They all entered illegally from Canada or jumped ship in American ports before the list of special interest countries even existed. None of them successfully carried out their attacks and none illegally crossed the Mexican border.\u201d\n\nThese flawed statistics are at the heart of the government shutdown because Trump and his advisers keep citing them as they demand funding for a border wall. In each case, we\u2019re starting with a sliver of official data that gets twisted and stretched to the point of deception. It doesn\u2019t help Trump\u2019s case that Nielsen is using two similar numbers for people linked to terrorism \u2014 who might not be terrorists or might not be on the border.", "lang": "en"}
