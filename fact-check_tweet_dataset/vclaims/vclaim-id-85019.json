Every Hindu lion is urged to track and hunt the boys from this list) A Facebook page by the name of \u201cHindutva Varta\u201d (Hindutva Talk) posted a list of 102 couples \u2013 Hindu girls in relationships with Muslim boys \u2013 and called for Hindus to come forward and attack the boys. The page that has a gun as its profile picture has shared a database and made this open call for violence. Fanned by sections of the media and members of the ruling Hindu nationalist party, the bogie of \u201clove-jihad\u201d is now out of hand. The situation is alarming with a radical group inciting targeted violence against a list of individuals.\n\nThe offensive post of the \u201cHindutva Varta\u201d page has now been deleted after it caused uproar on social media. Alt News has archived the information but will not reproduce it here in the interest of safety of the couples involved.\n\nA glance through the page reveals its violent agenda. In one incendiary post, it urges parents to teach girls to use guns to save themselves from Jihad.\n\nIn another post a group of men is seen beating up a person. \u201cAlong with the cow, the person who slaughtered it will also be dead\u201d, says the accompanying message.\n\nThe list shared by \u201cHindutva Varta\u201d was also shared in November, 2017 by a page called \u201cJustice for Hindus\u201d. Unlike \u201cHindutva Varta\u201d, there was no call for violence and the long list was shared as a wake-up call. The message accompanying the list said, \u201cHindu girls are converting to Islam by love jihad (Love Jihad, also called Romeo Jihad, is an alleged activity under which young Muslim boys and men are said to reportedly target young girls belonging to non-Muslim communities for conversion to Islam by feigning love. Wake up Hindus otherwise you will lose your homeland India. Here is a long list of love jihad with their Facebook ID link\u201d. The page gave credit to a certain Riddhiman Kunti for the list.\n\nThe \u201cHindutva Varta\u201d page routinely posts inflammatory messages that have a very obvious objective to polarize communities and radicalize Hindu youth. The content talks openly of Hindu supremacy and violence against Muslims. There are many Hindutva pages on social media that post provocative content but this page has gone a step further in calling for an attack. This threat should not be taken lightly. While the particular post has been deleted, the page is still available on Facebook. We hope the home ministry and local police authorities will investigate it further before it carries out its threats against the 102 couples named in its post.", "lang": "en"}
