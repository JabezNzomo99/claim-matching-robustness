Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be found here.\n\nClaim: In Britain, the country which ruled India for 200 years, Modi was the head of the meeting which was attended by the heads of 53 countries. Fact: The picture was taken at the International Business Council event \u2013 2018 in Davos, Switzerland; not in Britain. Also, the people standing are not the heads of countries but CEOs of various companies. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image in the post is run through Google Reverse Image search, it can be found that the photo was taken at the International Business Council event \u2013 2018. The Press Information Bureau of the government has published the exact photo with the title \u201cThe Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi interacting with the top global CEOs, at the International Business Council event, in Davos on January 23, 2018.\u201d on its website. So it can be concluded that the photo was not taken in Britain and the people standing before Modi are top global CEOs, not heads of various countries.\n\nFinally, the photo was taken at the International Business Council event \u2013 2018 in Davos, Switzerland; not in Britain.", "lang": "en"}
