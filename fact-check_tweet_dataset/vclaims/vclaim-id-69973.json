As per the article, the image shows wedding rituals of Hindu-Muslim couple Ashita and Shakeel at Taj Convention Hall in Bannimanta locality of Mysore. The report added that the marriage was held peacefully amidst tight security due to threats from \u201cHindutva extremists\u201d.\n\nTheir wedding was also reported by The Indian Express which said that local Bajrang Dal and BJP members opposed to the marriage as Ashita had decided to convert to Islam.\n\nAlt News reached out to Kapil Mishra who shared his statement given to fact-checking organisation Boomlive. \u201cI have three sisters of which two are married. Neither my sisters nor the distant ones are married to a Muslim,\u201d he clarified.\n\nThus a four-year-old wedding photo of a Hindu-Muslim couple in Mysore has gone viral with the false claim that BJP Delhi leader Kapil Mishra\u2019s sister married a Muslim man.", "lang": "en"}
