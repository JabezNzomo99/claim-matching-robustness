Reid, the host of MSNBC\u2019s AM Joy, wondered whether Trump\u2019s initial downplaying of white nationalists\u2019 culpability stemmed from alt-right influence among his staff:\n\n\"Who's writing the talking points that he was looking down and reading from? He has people like Stephen Miller, claimed as a mentee by Richard Spencer, who is an avowed open white nationalist. He has Steve Bannon, who's been sort of allowed to \u2026 meld into \u2026 the normalcy of a governmental employee, but who ran Breitbart.com, which I reread today, the post that's still on their website, where they self-describe as the home of the alt-right.\n\n\"What is the alt-right? It is a dressed-up term for white nationalism. They call themselves white identitarianism. They say that the tribalism that's sort of inherent in the human spirit ought to be also applied to white people.\n\n\"That is who is in his government. Sebastian Gorka, who wore the medal of Vit\u00e9zi Rend, a Nazi organization, being paid by the taxpayer, in the government of Donald Trump. The former Publius Decius blogger Michael Anton in the government.\n\n\"He is surrounded by these people. It isn't both sides. He's in the White House -- they're in the White House with him.\"\n\nFellow panelist Rich Lowry, who edits the conservative National Review, which has taken strong exception to Trump, pushed back.\n\n\"I want the alt-right to be as limited as possible -- I want it to go away and die -- but you aren't doing folks on my side any favors by defining it so widely that it includes Stephen Miller and Mike Anton,\" Lowry said on the show. \"That's what they want. You're helping them by defining it so widely.\"\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Reid did not explicitly accuse any of the four individuals she named of being white nationalists or alt-right members per se. But she suggested that the four were sympathetic to people who do fall into that category.\n\nWe decided to take a closer look. Because of the complexities of this issue, and because some of the evidence is in dispute, we\u2019re not applying a Truth-O-Meter rating to Reid\u2019s comments.\n\nFirst, we\u2019ll look at the general question of defining the alt-right and white nationalism. Then we\u2019ll look at the four specific individuals Reid cited, and weigh her evidence. The White House and Reid shared evidence that we have included in the analysis below.\n\nThe boundaries, and degree of overlap, between the alt-right, white nationalists, and older white supremacist groups such as the KKK or neo-Nazis -- all of which had a presence in the Charlottesville march -- is debated territory.\n\nTwo anti-extremist groups, the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center, offer similar definitions that differ somewhat in wording.\n\nThe ADL calls white nationalism \"a term used by white supremacists as a euphemism for white supremacy,\" while the SPLC calls it the belief in \"a white nation for and run by whites. White nationalists believe race and IQ are related and that black people are inherently inferior in IQ.\"\n\nMeanwhile, SPLC calls the alt-right \"a recent rebranding of white nationalism,\" while the ADL calls it \"a loose network of people who promote white identity and reject mainstream conservatism in favor of politics that embrace implicit or explicit racism, anti-Semitism and white supremacy.\"\n\nThe reality is that \"there is no agreed-upon definition of the borders between these groups,\" said Joshua Green, author of Devil's Bargain: Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, and the Storming of the Presidency, which delved into questions about the alt-right and Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. \"I think most people make their judgments in much the same way that Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart explained his definition of obscenity: \u2018I know it when I see it.\u2019 \"\n\nThomas J. Main, a professor at Baruch College-CUNY and author of the forthcoming book Rise of the Alt-Right, said the defining characteristic of white nationalists is \"anyone who boldly steps forward and says that all people are not created equal,\" particularly on the question of whose voice should be counted in the political sphere.\n\nOften, the main differences between various categories \"are matters of style and tactics,\" said Nicole Hemmer, a University of Virginia professor and author of Messengers of the Right: Conservative Media and the Transformation of American Politics.\n\nNeo-Nazis, for their part, typically rely on the imagery of Nazi Germany, while neo-Confederates focus instead on imagery of the Confederacy.\n\nTo Hemmer, one of the most notable aspects of the alt-right is that it \"has largely emerged online,\" and that \"the alt-right positions itself as a response to political correctness, arguing that the aggressive defense of white rights and men's rights is a byproduct of liberal identity politics.\"\n\nWhen political scientist Carol Swain was researching her 2002 book, The New White Nationalism in America: Its Challenge to Integration, she noticed the beginnings of today\u2019s alt-right.\n\n\"They were well-educated, and they did not espouse public violence in interviews and did not use racial epithets,\" said Swain, who is African-American and who has spoken out against political correctness on campus. \"But they felt like there were racial double standards and they felt that white people were discriminated against.\"\n\nStephen Miller was \u2018claimed as a mentee by Richard Spencer, who is an avowed open white nationalist\u2019\n\nMiller, a former aide to then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. -- now Trump\u2019s attorney general -- currently serves as senior adviser for policy in the White House and has periodically represented the administration on television. His key issue -- and Sessions\u2019 -- has historically been immigration, namely tightening it.\n\nIn describing Miller, Reid has carefully chosen her words.\n\nFor starters, experts we checked with agreed that Richard Spencer, who heads a group called the National Policy Institute, is fairly categorized as a white nationalist.\n\nMedia outlets including Vanity Fair have noted that Spencer, at a 2016 alt-right conference, said, \"To be white is to be a striver, a crusader, an explorer and a conqueror. We build, we produce, we go upward. And we recognize a central lie of American race relations. We don\u2019t exploit other groups -- we don\u2019t gain anything from their presence. They need us, and not the other way around. ... America was, until this past generation, a white country, designed for ourselves and our posterity. It is our creation, it is our inheritance, and it belongs to us.\"\n\nReid is also correct that Miller was \"claimed as a mentee\" by Spencer.\n\nAccording to Vanity Fair, Spencer says he became aware of Miller when both were at Duke University and was \"impressed\" with his communications ability.\n\n\"Being a few years older and in graduate school, Spencer says, he mentored Miller. \u2018But I do think that Stephen probably would\u2019ve ended up exactly more or less where he is today whether he had met me or not,\u2019 he adds. \u2018He is his own man. ... He is a strong American nationalist, you could say. Certainly not a white nationalist, but he is an American nationalist and a civic nationalist or a public nationalist.\"\n\nHowever, Reid\u2019s telling leaves out that Miller has aggressively disputed Spencer\u2019s account. The Vanity Fair article added that Miller emailed Mother Jones in October 2016 that \"I have absolutely no relationship with Mr. Spencer. I completely repudiate his views, and his claims are 100 percent false.\"\n\nGreen said Miller told him the same thing as he was researching his book on Bannon.\n\nSteve Bannon \u2018ran Breitbart.com, which I reread today, the post that's still on their website, where they self-describe as the home of the alt-right.\u2019\n\nBannon, a senior counselor to the president, did previously run Breitbart.com before joining the Trump presidential campaign. And he did tell Mother Jones, \"We\u2019re the platform for the alt-right,\" during an interview at the 2016 Republican National Convention. (Update: Bannon left his job at the White House on Aug. 18, 2017.)\n\nBut Reid incorrectly attributed that sentiment to an article on the Breitbart site, \"An Establishment Conservative\u2019s Guide To The Alt-Right,\" authored by Allum Bokhari and Milo Yiannopoulos. That piece -- while controversial -- is a March 2016 taxonomy of the various corners of the movement, not a manifesto of Breitbart\u2019s place in it.\n\nBannon has sought to offer a more nuanced definition of his views. In his book about Bannon, Green understood his term \"platform\" to mean a meeting place for a broad cross section of the right -- one that ranges from relatively mainstream to relatively fringe.\n\n\"Asked at the 2014 Vatican conference about the racist element found in many far-right parties, Bannon replied that \u2018over time it all gets kind of washed out,\u2019 \" Green wrote. \"He seemed to regard it as an unavoidable evil, a kind of way station on the path to populist triumph. \u2018When you look at any kind of revolution -- and this is a revolution -- you always have some groups that are disparate,\u2019 he\u2019d said. \u2018I think that will all burn away over time and you\u2019ll see more of a mainstream center-right populist movement.\u2019 \"\n\nGreen said that Bannon (and Miller) \"have made impassioned arguments to me that the policies they espouse, including the deportation of undocumented immigrants, would have beneficial effects for blacks and Hispanics.\" Bannon also denied that the alt-right is racist in his Mother Jones interview.\n\n\"He describes its ideology as \u2018nationalist,\u2019 though not necessarily white nationalist,\" the article said. \"Likening its approach to that of European nationalist parties such as France\u2019s National Front, he says, \u2018If you look at the identity movements over there in Europe, I think a lot of (them) are really \"Polish identity\" or \"German identity,\" not racial identity. It\u2019s more identity toward a nation-state or their people as a nation.\u2019 \"\n\nGorka serves as deputy assistant to the president and also appears on television to represent the administration. But Gorka has attracted controversy for, among other things, wearing symbols of a successor group to Vit\u00e9zi Rend, an honorary order that had originally been founded in 1920 by Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, a Hungarian ally of Adolf Hitler.\n\nTo say that Gorka \"wore the medal of Vit\u00e9zi Rend\" is accurate. However, calling today\u2019s incarnation of the group specifically \"a Nazi organization\" is in dispute.\n\nGorka\u2019s father was jailed and sentenced to forced labor by Hungary\u2019s Soviet-aligned government during the Cold War, and he later received an honor from the successor group for his anti-Communist activities. At times, Gorka has worn a medal of the group, including at Trump\u2019s inauguration. Gorka has said the medal merely honors his father. (Gorka was born in London after his parents emigrated there.)\n\nReporting by the Jewish publication the Forward suggested that Gorka\u2019s ties to the group went further -- that he had sworn a lifetime oath. The Forward also reported that from \"2002 to 2007, while he was active in Hungarian politics and journalism \u2026 he had close ties then to Hungarian far-right circles, and has in the past chosen to work with openly racist and anti-Semitic groups and public figures.\"\n\nGorka has forcefully denied any sympathies for Nazism, and he took issue with the Forward\u2019s reporting and inferences.\n\nHe told Tablet, another Jewish magazine, \"I have never been a member of the Vit\u00e9zi Rend. I have never taken an oath of loyalty to the Vit\u00e9zi Rend. Since childhood, I have occasionally worn my father\u2019s medal and used the \u2018v.\u2019 initial to honor his struggle against totalitarianism.\"\n\nGorka rejected an NBC investigation of the issue and said he had \"completely distanced\" himself from white supremacist and Nazi ideology groups.\n\n\u2018The former Publius Decius blogger Michael Anton\u2019 is on Trump\u2019s staff\n\nAnton is easily the least-known figure of the four Reid mentioned. He serves as director of strategic communications at the National Security Council.\n\nAfter he joined the White House staff, it was revealed that Anton was the writer behind a series of opinion pieces that had been signed \"Publius Decius Mus,\" named after a fallen consul in ancient Rome. They were considered a form of intellectual ballast for Trump at a time when few conservative academics were in his corner.\n\nPortions of the Publius Decius Mus column titled \"Toward a Sensible, Coherent Trumpism\" do address themes common of the alt-right, including racial politics:\n\n\"In their hearts, nearly all \u2018conservatives\u2019 long for absolution on the charge of \u2018racism.\u2019 Like the atheist caricature of the devout husband guilt-wracked for coveting his own wife, the modern conservative believes the leftist lie that his natural affinity for people who look, think and speak like himself is shameful and illegitimate, to be internally repressed and publicly denied.\"\n\nLater, the article says, \"Yes, it is true that \u2018all men are created equal.\u2019 But Lincoln adds the crucial caveat: All men are not \u2018equal in all respects\u2019 (emphasis in the original). They are not \u2018equal in color, size, intellect, moral developments or social capacity.\u2019 People from different nations with different circumstances, histories, beliefs and traditions will \u2014 by definition \u2014 hold very different conceptions of good government, some irreconcilably opposed to our own.\"\n\nSo, Anton was Publius Decius Mus, as Reid said. But the significance of one\u2019s anonymous blogging is open to debate.\n\nAre any of these four officials white nationalists?\n\nWhen we asked this question of several independent experts, they all agreed that none of the four were white nationalists themselves. However, several said that they had placed themselves uncomfortably close to white nationalists.\n\nAryeh Tuchman, associate director of the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Center on Extremism, told PolitiFact \"we would not consider\" any of the four to be white nationalists.\n\nGeorge Hawley, a University of Alabama political scientist and author of the forthcoming book, Making Sense of the Alt-Right, said he \"would probably not describe any high-ranking White House officials as white nationalists.\" He added, however, that \"important members of the Trump administration can definitely be described as right-wing populists and nativists. These are ideological stances that deserve criticism, but white nationalism is a much more extreme ideology.\"\n\nBannon does try to \"maintain the appearance that the particular entity he\u2019s referring to is the nation, rather than a race,\" said Main of Baruch College. \"Do I think that\u2019s a tremendous improvement? Not really. But I think it\u2019s a distinction that has to be made.\"\n\nAnd Hemmer, the University of Virginia professor, said the term she would use is \"white nationalist-adjacent. Their biographies and rhetoric signal to white nationalists that they have friends in the White House. Put another way, they're not Richard Spencers or David Dukes, but they make the Richard Spencers and David Dukes feel more comfortable with the administration.\"\n\nIndeed, as the New York Times noted in December 2016, \"While he does not consider either Mr. Trump or Mr. Bannon alt-right, Mr. Spencer has expressed hope that the press\u2019s describing them as such will help his own group grow.\"", "lang": "en"}
