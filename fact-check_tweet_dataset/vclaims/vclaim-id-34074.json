In the middle of the group is an elderly man wearing a skull cap hurling stone. The image is circulating with the claim, \u201c\u0930\u0939\u092e\u093e\u0928 \u091a\u091a\u093e 500 \u0930\u0941 \u0932\u0947\u0915\u0930 \u092a\u0924\u094d\u0925\u0930 \u092b\u0947\u0902\u0915\u0928\u0947 \u0917\u092f\u0947 \u0925\u0947\u2026. \u092f\u0942\u092a\u0940 \u092a\u0941\u0932\u093f\u0938 \u0928\u0947 \u0909\u0928\u094d\u0939\u0947\u0902 1,50,000 \u0915\u093e \u0928\u094b\u091f\u093f\u0938 \u092d\u0947\u091c \u0926\u093f\u092f\u093e (Rehman uncle had gone to pelt stones for Rs 500. UP Police has sent him notice of Rs 1,50,000 -translated)\u201d\n\nA post by Pavan Kharab, who on his Facebook profile claims to be associated with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, has amassed over 5,100 shares.\n\nMany people on Twitter and Facebook shared the image with a similar claim.\n\nOn December 24, the same image was tweeted by Pakistani-Canadian author Tarek Fatah with the message, \u201cMeanwhile #, in India a \u2018peaceful\u2019 in action.\u201d It has garnered more than 4,500 retweets so far.\n\nA reverse search of the image on Google revealed that it is almost three years old. We found the same image posted on January 8, 2016. The user claimed that the image is from the Malda riots.\n\nAlt News couldn\u2019t ascertain whether the image represents the riots that took place in West Bengal. However, it is worthwhile to note that the violence reportedly broke out on January 3, 2016, in Kaliachak block of Malda while the earliest instance that Alt News could find was January 8, 2016.\n\nIn conclusion, an old photograph of stone-pelting has been shared in the background of anti-CAA protest across the country. The claim falsely suggests that a Muslim protester who was pelting stones for money has been heavily penalised by the UP government.", "lang": "en"}
