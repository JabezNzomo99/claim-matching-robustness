Anyone saw her? Please help us find her.\u201d\n\nAs we\u2019ve said before, the story is false and takes you to a website that attempts to gather your Facebook password by asking you to watch a fake video. You should not click links associated with the post.\n\nThe website appears to be hosted via a Polish domain, despite claiming to report UK local news.\n\nThe story claims that the child went missing on 30 June in one paragraph, but on 15 January in the next. As we\u2019ve also seen before, the article headline appears to have been adapted to say the little girl went missing in various locations, for example, Walsall, Kidlington, and Ayrshire.\n\nThe apparent Facebook comments under the article are not real, and clicking on them does not lead to any Facebook profiles.\n\nThere have been no reports from Missing People, Child Rescue Alert, or news stories about a child called Alice going missing in the UK this year.\n\nThis all suggests the story about the missing girl is not real.\n\nYou should never give your Facebook password to a website other than Facebook.
