A reverse image search found the picture was actually taken in Thailand at the Kham Tok Islands on November 6, 2016. The photographer and Google mapping data both confirmed this.\n\nA Facebook post shared a photograph that it claimed showed Boracay, a top tourist destination in the Philippines, after a major clean-up which started in April this year.\n\nThe post says: \"Wow! Boracay is so beautiful and is now ready for its re-opening in October. Thanks to Digong our father because you're the only one who can make this kind of change\".\n\nA reverse image search found that the photo actually showed Ao Khao Kwai in the Kham Tok Islands in Thailand.\n\nThe search found that the image was first posted online by the stock photography company Shutterstock, under the account of photographer Teerasak Khunrach.\n\nPhotographer Teerasak Khunrach, who is from Thailand, told AFP that he had taken the photo.\n\n\"Yes, that is my photo,\" he said. \"I took it on November 6, 2016. This is in Ao Khao Kwai, Kham Tok Islands, Thailand\".\n\nUsing the information provided by Teerasak and a reverse image search, AFP confirmed that this image was taken on the island of Ko Kham, and not on Boracay.\n\nA set of indicators enabled AFP to demonstrate that this photo was taken on Ko Kham:\n\n1 - The presence of two slopes -- a smaller one in front of a larger slope\n\n2 - A distinctively shaped island, with the slope of the left side being smaller than the one on the right side\n\n3 - The trees which hug the shoreline\n\nA search using Google Maps in street view found that all three of these indicators were present. The shape of the coastline also matched that found in the photograph.\n\nThe image on Google Maps was taken approximately four months after the Shutterstock photographer took the original photo.\n\nBoracay was closed to tourists in April for rehabilitation after Duterte called it a \"cesspool\". The department of tourism has said it will be reopened in October.", "lang": "en"}
