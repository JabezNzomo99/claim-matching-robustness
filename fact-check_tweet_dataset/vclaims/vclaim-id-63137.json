An early part of the clip shows patients inside Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor, it then cuts to scenes that were actually filmed inside another Madrid hospital, Hospital Universitario Severo Ochoa.\n\nThe location of both videos was confirmed by Spanish newspaper El Mundo and they were filmed in mid-March.\n\nThere are some clues in the videos that they were not filmed in the UK. For example, an exit sign visible in the video is written in Spanish rather than English.\n\nThere are also no recent news stories about St Mary\u2019s Hospital detailing the overcrowding shown in the video.", "lang": "en"}
