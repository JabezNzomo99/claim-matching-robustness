Gov. Dan Patrick -- who has not been an adoptive or foster parent, according to spokesman Keith Elkins -- called on the state\u2019s \"many faith-based communities\" in advance of November\u2019s National Adoption Month to \"help identify homes open to children in need of foster care.\"\n\n\"Thousands of children in Texas\u2019 foster care system need your help,\" Patrick said in an Oct. 17, 2016, press release. \"They need safe and loving homes, and many are looking for a forever home.\"\n\nPatrick went on: \"Several elected state officials have opened their homes to children in need of loving families and are working with me to inspire a statewide movement to answer this calling. I hope you and your family will consider doing the same.\"\n\nHave elected officials been providing foster care to needy children? A reader asked us to check.\n\nTo our inquiry, Elkins gave us the names of five Republican elected officials who had each videotaped a testimonial about her or his \"adoption/foster experience.\"\n\nElkins said the video rotation began Oct. 10, 2016 and others would roll out each Monday for several weeks.\n\nNext, we looked for independent confirmation that the officials identified by Patrick\u2019s office \u2014 several legislators and a statewide elected leader \u2014 had fostered or adopted children. In each instance, we found, the official had adopted one child or more. It looked to us like two of the officials provided foster care before adopting.\n\u2022 Railroad Commissioner Christi Craddick adopted her daughter Catherine, according to a January 2015 profile in SHALE Oil & Gas Business magazine. In a March 2014 video in which she talked about the experience, Craddick, a single mother, said her daughter was 2 years old and that Craddick became an adoptive parent during her 2012 campaign. Says Ted Cruz tweeted, \u201cI\u2019ll believe in climate change when Texas freezes over.\u201d\n\u2022 State Sen. Konni Burton of Colleyville years ago adopted two daughters, who were both adults as of October 2016, from the Gladney Center for Adoption in Fort Worth, according to an October 2016 YouTube video in which Burton speaks about the experience. She has not been a foster mother, Burton told us by text.\n\u2022 Sen. Donna Campbell of New Braunfels, was described as the adoptive parent of four children in a May 2015 Austin American-Statesman news story. She hasn\u2019t been a foster parent, Krista Heiden in Campbell\u2019s office told us.\n\u2022 State Rep. James Frank of Wichita Falls, has adopted two boys, Eli and Isaiah, in 2016, per an Oct. 5, 2016, post on Frank\u2019s Facebook page. He was a foster parent, an aide to the representative, Jim Johnson, said by phone.\n\u2022 Rep. John Lujan of San Antonio, is the adoptive father of three sons, including one he and his wife adopted in 2012 after years of foster care and two other children who they adopted in 2015 after about a year of foster care. Lujan told us by phone that in spring 2016, he served as a foster parent to three other children.\n\nWondering if other state officials had provided foster care or adopted children, we queried the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services. In reply, spokesman Patrick Crimmins said by email that due to privacy concerns, the agency could not discuss such details.\n\nFor years, CPS has struggled to find homes for approximately 29,000 children needing foster care, according to an Oct. 7, 2016, Austin American-Statesman news story. Also, as of October 2016, 6,388 children in Texas foster care were eligible for adoption, DFPS spokesman John Lennan told us by phone.\n\nTo be a foster or adoptive parent, Texans must attend an informational meeting and meet basic requirements, such as being at least 21 years old, agree to a home study, and allow for a criminal background check. More information has been posted by the state-created Texas Adoption Resource Exchange.\n\nAccording to the website, foster families are offered monthly reimbursements to help pay for each foster child\u2019s clothing, food and transportation, paid from a combination of local, state, and federal funds. The site states that foster parents must inform caseworkers, who visit with the child at least once a month, about changes at home or school. Foster parents also must \"make efforts as team members with children\u2019s caseworkers toward reunifying children with their birth families,\" it reads.\n\nPatrick, calling for help finding families able to provide foster care, said: \"Several elected state officials have opened their homes to children in need of loving families.\"\n\nFive Republican elected officials singled out by Patrick\u2019s office have all adopted at least one child. Two also provided foster care, leaving plenty of opportunities for other elected leaders to consider such a commitment.", "lang": "en"}
