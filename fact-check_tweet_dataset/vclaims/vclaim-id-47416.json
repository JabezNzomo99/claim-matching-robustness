Netizens are using this picture to hit out at the Prime Minister, claiming he is meeting his \u201cChinese bosses\u201d.\n\nTwitter user \u201cVinay Kumar Dokania\u201d posted the picture and wrote, \u201cSo #ChineseDalalChowkidar can't hide his happiness when he meets his Chinese bosses. Wah Dalal Ji wah\u201d.\n\nAnother Twitter user \u201cMukesh Gupta\u201d shared the picture and wrote a caption in Hindi which translates to, \u201c#ModiChiniBhaiBhai This nexus has destroyed the country..!!\u201d The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the picture to be false. The one-year-old picture is of PM Modi with Kyrgyz President Sooronbay Jeenbekov.\n\nAnother user posted this picture in a reply to BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra when he tweeted a picture of former late PM Rajiv Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi sharing drinks with a man.\n\nReverse-searching the picture, we found it was taken in June last year when PM Modi visited Kyrgyzstan capital Bishkek for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit and met Kyrgyz President Sooronbay Jeenbekov.\n\n\u201cPMO India\u201d had also tweeted the picture with the caption, \u201cIn Bishkek, President Jeenbekov presented PM @narendramodi a Kalpak, the traditional Kyrgyz hat, a Chapan, a traditional coat from Kyrgyzstan and a Samovar, a container to heat or boil water. PM Modi is grateful to President Jeenbekov for this gesture.\u201d\n\nTherefore, we can say that the picture is of PM Modi greeting Kyrgyz President Sooronbay Jeenbekov and not any Chinese leader as claimed in the viral post. The picture is being circulated on social media in the backdrop of Indo-China tensions.", "lang": "en"}
