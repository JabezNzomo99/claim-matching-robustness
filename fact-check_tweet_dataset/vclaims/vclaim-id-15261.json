Let\u2019s try to analyze the authenticity of the picture and also the claim made by using it in the post.\n\nClaim: Nehru was kissed by a lady in the presence of Mohd. Ali Jinnah Fact: The lady seen kissing Nehru in the picture was Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s niece Nayantara Sehgal. The picture was taken when Nehru landed at London Airport in 1955. So, the post is MISLEADING.\n\nSeveral pictures of Nehru have been doing rounds in social media showcasing him as a womanizer for many years\n\nAltNews has already written a detailed article on all these pictures . Coming back to the original image in the post, the lady kissing Nehru was his sister Vijaya Laxmi\u2019s daughter, Nayantara Sehgal. This picture was taken when Nehru arrived at London airport in 1955 and can be seen in the video recording (0:27 sec) of British Path\u00e9, a vintage producer of newsreels and documentaries. In the video, Mr. Nehru was greeted by United Kingdom Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden and there was no Mohd. Ali Jinnah in the video.\n\nHence, the lady in the picture seen kissing Nehru is his niece Nayantara Sehgal and the posts on social media are being circulated to potray Nehru as a womanizer.", "lang": "en"}
