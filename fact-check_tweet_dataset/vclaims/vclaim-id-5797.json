One post with over 3,000 shares is accompanied by the caption, \u201cAnd he wants to be President of this great Country? If he will bend a knee to our flag for the mob, what will he also bend for with foreign envisions and other Countries? Wow! Never vote for someone this weak!\u201d This claim is false. Biden was not kneeling for the flag but rather to speak to a young child.\n\nExamples of the post can be seen here , here and here .\n\nThe posts imply that Biden kneeling in front of the flag is unpatriotic, drawing similarities with former NFL star Colin Kaepernick\u2019s decision to kneel during the national anthem at football games to protest against racial injustice. Kaepernick\u2019s critics, including President Trump, have accused him of being unpatriotic ( here ).\n\nThe photograph of Biden was taken by AP\u2019s Matt Slocum on, July 9, 2020, visible here . The photograph\u2019s caption reads, \u201cDemocratic presidential candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden kneels to talk with a child during a visit to Biden's childhood home in Scranton, Pa.\u201d\n\nA Reuters photograph by Tom Brenner from the same scene shows Biden waving goodbye to a child during this visit here . The photograph\u2019s caption reads, \u201cDemocratic U.S. presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden waves goodbye after talking to a young local child while surrounded by U.S. Secret Service agents and news media as he visits the neighborhood where he grew up while campaigning in Scranton, Pennsylvania, U.S., July 9, 2020.\u201d\n\nBrenner, having been on the scene, confirmed that Biden indeed took a knee \u201cto be at level with a child who was standing across the roadway.\u201d Video footage from the scene also shows Biden kneeling to speak with a child ( here ).\n\nPartly false. While Joe Biden is photographed kneeling at his childhood home in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he did so to speak to a child.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
