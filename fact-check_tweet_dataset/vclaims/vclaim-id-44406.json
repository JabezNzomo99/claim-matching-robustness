Bondi is now part of Trump\u2019s legal defense team.\n\n\n\n Sperry\u2019s statement is demonstrably false. All three networks covered Bondi\u2019s speech, which was given on Jan. 27, 2020, and covered what she posited to be the wrongdoings of Ukrainian energy firm Burisma and former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, who served as a board member of the firm from 2014 to 2019.\n\nAlthough neither Biden has been accused of criminal wrongdoing, the younger Biden\u2019s role on the board of Burisma has remained a talking point for defenders of Trump, who is accused of attempting to extort the Ukrainian president by withholding crucial military aid in exchange for damaging information on the Bidens.\n\nTrump was impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives on two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.", "lang": "en"}
