The piece was published two days after McCain\u2019s death, and the same or similar deceptions were posted on other websites.\n\nIn reality, the 2008 Washington Post story never said McCain was responsible for the accident. The most critical part of the piece actually centered on a nonfatal 1960 plane crash from when McCain was in flight school in Corpus Christi, Texas.\n\nThe Post story challenged a statement made in McCain\u2019s autobiography that the 1960 crash was due to engine failure. An official Navy report that was obtained by the Los Angeles Times found that wasn\u2019t the case.\n\nLos Angeles Times, Oct. 6, 2008: Investigators determined that McCain was watching instruments in his cockpit that indicated the position of his landing gear and had lost track of his altitude and speed. The Navy report concluded: \u201cIn the opinion of the board, the pilot\u2019s preoccupation in the cockpit . . . coupled with the use of a power setting too low to maintain level flight in a turn were the primary causes of this accident.\u201d\n\nYears later, in July 1967, McCain was aboard the carrier USS Forrestal when a missile that was fired accidentally from an aircraft hit another plane, sparking the deadly fire and explosions.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear whose plane the missile struck. McCain said the missile hit his plane, but records indicated that it likely struck the plane that was next to his. Still, there is no credible assertion that McCain, then a lieutenant commander, was to blame for that accident.\n\nAs we wrote in 2008, the official Navy investigation into the disaster showed the rocket actually misfired from the other side of the flight deck. James M. Caiella, a writer and editor who researched the event and obtained records from the Navy, told us then that \u201cthere is no possible way John McCain could have caused the fire on board the Forrestal.\u201d\n\nThe Post story made that point as well. After mentioning the 1967 disaster \u2014 and the episode months later in which his plane was shot down and he was captured by the North Vietnamese \u2014 the article notes that \u201cU.S. Navy records make clear that no blame can be attached to McCain for either of these incidents.\u201d\n\nThe Navy awarded McCain the Silver Star for his \u201cconspicuous gallantry\u201d while he was imprisoned for nearly five-and-a-half years. He also received the Distinguished Flying Cross, three Bronze Stars, two Purple Hearts and the Prisoner-of-War medal.\n\nUpdate, Aug. 29: After we published this article, Your News Wire updated its headline and story to remove the false claim that McCain was responsible for the deaths in the 1967 USS Forrestal disaster. \u201cThere is no evidence for this,\u201d the website said in its correction.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cThe Catastrophic Fire On Board USS Forrestal (CVA-59).\u201d The Naval History and Heritage Command. 5 Dec 2017.\n\nVartabedian, Ralph, and Richard A.
