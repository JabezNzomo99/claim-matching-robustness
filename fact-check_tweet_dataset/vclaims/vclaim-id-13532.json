Click here to view the tweet and here to view it on their website. The image appears to be from Kolhapur, Maharashtra. Hundreds of thousands of Marathas from various parts of Maharashtra have been walking to Mumbai demanding reservations in government jobs and educational institutions for their community.\n\nThe second image also appears to be from the Maratha agitation. BOOM found links which indicate the photo goes back to at least October 2016.\n\nThe same photo was featured by the Indian Express in October 2016 along with a caption that states it was taken in Mumbai's Thane district by photographer Deepak Joshi. BOOM reached out to Joshi who confirmed it was his image taken during one of the Maratha reservation protests.\n\nWe also found the third photograph appearing on News 18 Hindi's website about a protests demanding reservations in Rajasthan. Click here to view the link.\n\nIt has also appeared online in 2017 in the same context.\n\nIn the absence of a high resolution image appearing on any credible news sites it is hard to say where the image is originally from. However, we can say the image is old and is not from Uttar Pradesh.", "lang": "en"}
