But he was referring to a little-known case that had nothing to do with Ford.\n\nPresident Trump has claimed several times that Ms. Ford now admits that she never met Judge Kavanaugh, and the sexual assault she claimed occurred in fact never happened. Is this True?\n\nDuring a rally in Missouri the night before the midterm elections, President Donald Trump said that \u201cthe accuser of Brett Kavanaugh\u201d has \u201cadmitted she never met him, she never saw him \u2026 it was false accusations, it was a scam, it was fake.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump, Nov. 5: And you saw what happened on Friday, also. We had great jobs numbers, but we also had something else. The accuser of Brett Kavanaugh, a man who is a fine man, the accuser admitted she never met him, she never saw him, he never touched her, talked to her, he had nothing to do with her, she made up the story, it was false accusations, it was a scam, it was fake. It was all fake. And you know, when that came about, people were calling for him to immediately get out. Think of that. Think if he would have done that, and then we found out that it was all false accusations. False statements. A made-up story. And let\u2019s look at the rest of them please. Let\u2019s look at the rest of them. Because that man suffered.\n\nTrump had made similar comments at a rally in Montana two days earlier, saying that \u201cone of [Kavanaugh\u2019s] accusers \u2026 just came out a little while ago and said it was all a lie; that she never met now-Justice Kavanaugh. \u2026 It was a made-up story.\u201d\n\nDozens of our readers have written to us about this, some of them asking if Ford \u2014 the woman who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee about her allegations of sexual assault by Kavanaugh \u2014 had recanted her claims. That\u2019s not accurate.\n\nSome readers referred to headlines of articles about a Kavanaugh accuser admitting to making up her story and assumed it was about Ford, even though the ensuing stories made clear it was not.\n\nIt is certainly understandable that some assumed Trump was talking about Ford when he referred to \u201cthe accuser of Brett Kavanaugh.\u201d Ford was by far the most publicly identified Kavanaugh accuser, and the only one to personally testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, an event watched by millions around the country. Ford said Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when the two were in high school 36 years ago.\n\nIn fact, though, Trump was referring to a bit player in the Kavanaugh saga, a woman who admitted that she falsely claimed to have penned an anonymous letter claiming that Kavanaugh and another man had raped her.\n\nThe handwritten anonymous letter in question was sent to Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 office, which immediately passed the letter along to Senate Judiciary Committee investigators on Sept. 25. The letter, signed \u201cJane Doe\u201d from Oceanside, California, alleged that Kavanaugh and another man raped her in the backseat of a car. On Sept. 26, Senate committee staff questioned Kavanaugh about the accusations in the letter. Kavanaugh said the claim was \u201cridiculous,\u201d \u201ca crock\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t happen.\u201d A transcript of the interview and the text of the letter were publicly released by the committee that day, and a few media outlets \u2014 but only a few \u2014 reported on it.\n\nOn Oct. 3, two days before the Senate narrowly confirmed Kavanaugh, the judiciary committee got an email from Judy Munro-Leighton in which she claimed to be \u201cJane Doe from Oceanside CA.\u201d However, during a phone interview with judiciary investigators on Nov. 1, Munro-Leighton \u201cadmitted, contrary to her prior claims, that she had not been sexually assaulted by Judge Kavanaugh and was not the author of the original \u2018Jane Doe\u2019 letter,\u201d according to a letter from Sen. Chuck Grassley referring Munro-Leighton to the attorney general and FBI for investigation into possible charges: making a materially false statement to a Senate committee and obstruction. According to Grassley\u2019s letter, Munro-Leighton said she made up the story to \u201cgrab attention\u201d and that it was \u201cjust a ploy\u201d to oppose Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation.\n\nTo be clear, though, Senate investigators don\u2019t know who wrote the original, anonymous letter that was sent to Harris\u2019 office, only that it wasn\u2019t Munro-Leighton.\n\nAs we said, the allegations contained in the anonymous letter were not widely reported by national media outlets, certainly not as widely as the allegations made by Ford, Deborah Ramirez \u2014 a classmate of Kavanaugh\u2019s at Yale who said he exposed himself to her at a party \u2014 and Julie Swetnick \u2014 who claimed she witnessed Kavanaugh grabbing women inappropriately.\n\nIn addition to Munroe-Leighton, Grassley referred Swetnick and her attorney, Michael Avenatti, to the Justice Department for criminal investigation related to a potential conspiracy to provide materially false statements to Congress and obstruction.\n\nNo referral has been made for Ford or Ramirez.\n\nTrump initially said he found Ford\u2019s testimony \u201cvery compelling\u201d and that she was a \u201cvery credible witness.\u201d But he later mocked her memory of the event \u2014 in some cases falsely \u2014 and repeatedly questioned its truth. After Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, Trump said he was \u201c100 percent certain\u201d that Kavanaugh did not commit any sexual assault.\n\nPollak, Joel B. \u201cBrett Kavanaugh Rape Accuser Admits She Made Up Her Story.\u201d Breitbart. 2 Nov 2018.\n\nStraub, Steve. \u201cKavanaugh Accuser RECANTS; Says She Made It Up.\u201d The Federalist Papers. 2 Nov 2018.\n\nLetter from Sen.
