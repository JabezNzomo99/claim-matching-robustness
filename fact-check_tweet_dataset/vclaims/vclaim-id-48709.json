Even a demon will feel nervous getting inside their food market -translated)\u201d, said Meena while posting the video.\n\nThe video is getting shared on Twitter and Facebook alike since February 2020.\n\nWith a keyword search on Facebook, we found a longer version of the same video, which is close to five minutes long.\n\nAt the very beginning of this video, one can spot the text \u2013 Pasar EXTREAM Langowan. We then performed a keyword search on Google and found a high-resolution YouTube video posted on July 19, 2019.\n\nIn one of the frames at around 20 seconds in the above video, we see a board which reads, \u201cKantor Pasar Langowan\u201d. In Indonesian, it means \u2018market office Langowan\u2019. The \u201cLangowan market\u201d is a traditional market where wild animals are sold for consumption. It is located in Minahasa Regency of Indonesia\u2019s North Sulawesi.\n\nWe corroborated the location with two more videos (1, 2) of the same market uploaded by the YouTube channel Dog Meat Free Indonesia, a global campaign calling on the Indonesian government to end slaughter, trade and consumption of dog meat.\n\nIn the course of our research, we also found that Turkish media outlet TRT also used the scenes (at 32 seconds in the video) of the same Indonesian market while saying, \u201cCoronavirus are fairly common in species of animals but this specific virus was traced back to a seafood market in the city of Wuhan where a number of animals are sold illegally\u201d. This video was tweeted on January 30, 2020. The outlet had sourced the visuals from a YouTube clip which identified this market\u2019s location as Wuhan, China. It was uploaded on January 27, 2020.\n\nA video of an Indonesian market is being circulated on social media with the claim that it shows the \u2018wet market\u2019 of China\u2019s Wuhan province where the coronavirus seems to have originated. It was also picked up by an international Turkish media outlet and broadcasted as \u201cWuhan\u2019s seafood\u201d market.", "lang": "en"}
