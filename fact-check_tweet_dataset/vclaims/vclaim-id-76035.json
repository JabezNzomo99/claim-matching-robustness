The debate was sponsored by the Atlanta Press Club. \n\n\n\nState Sen. Gail Buckner (D-Jonesboro) quickly found herself on the defensive when she was accused of not filing a personal financial disclosure report as required by the state Ethics Commission. \n\n\n\nChallenger Gary Horlacher alleged Buckner had not filed within the seven days required after she qualified to run for statewide office. Buckner, a 18-year veteran of the state Legislature, shot back that she had. Buckner was in the state House of Representatives 16 years and has served two in the state Senate. \n\n\n\n\u201cI have filed every disclosure that has ever been required,\u201d she said. \n\n\n\nSo who\u2019s right?\n\n\n\nHorlacher, a metro Atlanta attorney, said Buckner was required to file a personal financial disclosure report within seven days after she qualified to run for secretary of state. But the only disclosure she filed was back in January, before she qualified to run for statewide office. She qualified to run for secretary of state in April.\n\n\n\nThe state Ethics Commission Web site has this to say about the required filing:\n\n\n\n\u201cA Personal Financial Disclosure Statement covering the period of the preceding calendar year shall be filed no later than the fifteenth day following the date of qualifying as a candidate. Candidates for statewide office file not later than seven days after qualifying for office. Only one Personal Financial Disclosure Statement is required per calendar year.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat seems clear-cut. But not so much in this case, according to Stacey Kalberman, executive secretary for the Ethics Commission. \n\n\n\nKalberman said Buckner filed a \u201cstatewide form\u201d earlier this year that effectively covers her subsequent decision to run for secretary of state. That fulfills the Ethics Commission\u2019s requirements, Kalberman said.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe filed a statewide form in January, so she\u2019s good,\u201d Kalberman said. \n\n\n\nA check of the Ethics Commission\u2019s Web site shows Buckner electronically filed the form on Jan. 8 at 8:04 p.m. It lists everything from Buckner\u2019s salary, to the value of her home and vehicles. \n\n\n\nHorlacher said he still thinks Buckner has violated the letter and intent of the filing requirement. And he vowed not to drop the issue.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am down to deciding whether to formally request an advisory opinion from the [Ethics] Commission,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the state might be better off just to get clarification on this so it is not repeated.\u201d \n\n\n\nBut as of now, Buckner appears to have done what is required of her. We give her a rating of True on this one.", "lang": "en"}
