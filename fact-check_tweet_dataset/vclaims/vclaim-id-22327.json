I want clean air. I want crystal clean water. And we\u2019ve got it. We\u2019ve got the cleanest country in the planet right now. There\u2019s nobody cleaner than us, and it\u2019s getting better and better, but I\u2019m getting rid of some these ridiculous rules and regulations, which are killing our companies, our states and our jobs.\n\nTrump provided no evidence, and the White House didn\u2019t provide us with any when we asked.\n\nBut there are several countries that are \u201ccleaner\u201d than the U.S., overall and in specific categories, according to the most recent EPI.\n\nThe report \u2014 which is released biennially in even-numbered years \u2014 was produced jointly by Yale and Columbia in collaboration with the World Economic Forum.\n\nThis year, the U.S. ranked 10th in air quality, though it was tied with 11 other countries for 1st in household air pollution. And it ranked 29th overall in water and sanitation, though it was tops in drinking water along with nine other nations.\n\nThe U.S. rankings in those categories suffered due to lower scores in exposure to particulate matter (where it was 88th) and sanitation (where it was 31st).\n\nFactoring in all 24 performance indicators across the 10 environmental health and ecosystem vitality categories, the U.S. ranked 27th on the index.\n\n\u201cThis ranking,\u201d a press release said, \u201cputs the United States near the back of the industrialized nations, behind France (2nd), the United Kingdom (6th), Germany (13th), Italy (16th), Japan (20th) and Canada (25th).\u201d\n\nSo there are indeed countries that are cleaner than the U.S.", "lang": "en"}
