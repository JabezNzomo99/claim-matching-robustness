And now, a picture showing a hall full of coffins has gone viral on social media with the claim that these are the coffins of Covid-19 patients who died in a single day in Italy.\n\nThe caption along with the viral photo says, \"Stop making mockery of CORONAVIRUS. CORONAVIRUS is real. See what happened in Italy. All these died in one day\".\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the viral photo to be false. The picture is indeed from Italy but it is seven years old and has nothing to do with the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe picture along with the misleading claim has been shared by thousands on social media.\n\nUsing Google reverse image search, we found the viral photo on Getty Images, which said these are coffins of African migrants killed in a shipwreck off Lampedusa island in Italy. The photo was taken on October 5, 2013, at Lampedusa airport.\n\nThe incident was widely reported in the media at that time. More than 350 migrants from Africa were on their way to Italy when the mishap took place.\n\nA report by \"Al Jazeera\" says \"Italy announced 793 more deaths on March 21, the second day in a row of the biggest day-to-day increase in the country's four-week epidemic, after surpassing China's death toll on Thursday\".\n\nIt was also reported that the Italian army was ferrying coffins from Bergamo, its worst-hit town, to remote cremation sites because local morgues were not able to cope with the surging death toll.", "lang": "en"}
