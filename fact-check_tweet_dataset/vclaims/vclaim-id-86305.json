Trump appears to be counting on that confusion to offer a fog of claims and allegations to make it appear as if Biden had done something wrong. So here\u2019s a quick guide to Trump\u2019s statements \u2014 and the truth.\n\nBiden was among the many Western officials who pressed for the removal of Shokin because he actually was not investigating the corruption endemic to the country. Indeed, he was not investigating Burisma at the time. In September 2015, then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt publicly criticized Shokin\u2019s office for thwarting a British money-laundering probe into Burisma\u2019s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky.\n\n\u201cShokin was not investigating. He didn\u2019t want to investigate Burisma,\u201d Daria Kaleniuk, of the Ukrainian Anti-Corruption Action Center, told The Washington Post in July. \u201cAnd Shokin was fired not because he wanted to do that investigation, but quite to the contrary, because he failed that investigation.\u201d\n\nIn a 2018 appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations, Biden bragged about his role in Shokin\u2019s removal, saying he had withheld $1 billion in loan guarantees as leverage to force action. But Biden was carrying out a policy developed at the State Department and coordinated with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.\n\nThe Ukrainian prosecutor was regarded as a failure, and \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s efforts to oust Shokin were universally praised,\u201d said Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist heavily involved in Eastern European market reforms. Getting rid of Shokin was considered the linchpin of reform efforts, but U.S. officials had a list of changes the government needed to make before it could obtain another loan guarantee.\n\nIn December 2015, Biden traveled to Kiev and decried the \u201ccancer of corruption\u201d in the country in a speech to the parliament. \u201cThe Office of the General Prosecutor desperately needs reform,\u201d he noted. Shokin was removed from office three months later, and Biden announced April 15 that the loan guarantee would go forward; the agreement between the United States and Ukraine was signed June 3.\n\nOne can certainly raise questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s judgment in joining Burisma\u2019s board at a time his father had a high-profile role in working with Ukraine\u2019s government. But by continuing to claim that Biden \u201cdid\u201d something for his son, Trump persists in spreading a false narrative about a diplomatic maneuver hailed at the time as a step toward reducing corruption in Ukraine.\n\nTwelve days after he flew to Beijing, Hunter Biden joined an advisory board of a fund called BHR Partners, which had announced it would try to raise $1.5 billion. The New Yorker magazine reported that during the trip Hunter Biden arranged for his father to shake hands with Jonathan Li, who ran a Chinese private-equity fund and was one of the partners who had formed BHR.\n\nBut while Joe Biden was vice president, Hunter Biden was only on the board of the advisory firm that did not directly invest, but instead advised those who did. George Mesires, a lawyer for Hunter Biden, said he only took an equity stake in 2017, after Joe Biden was no longer vice president.\n\nFalse: Biden lied about talking to his son\n\nTrump claimed that this was a lie because \u201che\u2019s already said he spoke to his son.\u201d But Biden had not. Instead, Trump appeared to be referring to a line in the New Yorker profile: \u201cAs Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: \u2018Dad said, \u201cI hope you know what you are doing,\u201d and I said, \u201cI do.\u201d \u2019\u201d\n\nTrump claimed that three Democratic senators \u2014 Patrick J. Leahy (Vt.), Richard J. Durbin (Ill.) and Robert Menendez (N.J.) \u2014 \u201cimplied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake and that if they didn\u2019t do the right thing they wouldn\u2019t get any assistance.\u201d He later referred to \u201csenators that threatened him with votes and no money coming into Ukraine if they do things.\u201d\n\nThe letter, written to the special prosecutor at the time, Yuriy Lutsenko, expressed concern about a New York Times report that Ukraine had stopped cooperating with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election to avoid upsetting Trump. The letter does not threaten a loss of aid, though it notes that the Times article said that the freezing of cooperation was motivated by a worry that Trump would cut off aid. (The article was titled: \u201cUkraine, Seeking U.S. Missiles, Halted Cooperation with Mueller Investigation.\u201d)\n\nThe letter noted the signers have supported efforts to build Ukraine\u2019s democracy and expressed \u201cdisappointment\u201d that some lawmakers in Kiev were trying \u201cto avoid the ire of President Trump.\u201d The senators then ask a series of questions, seeking to clarify whether the Times report was correct and whether the Trump administration had encouraged the government not to cooperate with Mueller.", "lang": "en"}
