No media reports about the Kenyan government enlisting the Maasai tribe to enforce the country\u2019s curfew could be found online.\n\nThe Kenyan government has instituted, among other measures, a curfew from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. local time and a requirement that all people wear face masks in public to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus in the country, according to BBC News.

As he swings a whip at several people in the streets of Kenya\u2019s capital city of Nairobi, he shouts, \u201cOne meter!\u201d The caption claims the Kenyan government is \u201cemploying Maasai tribe in enforcing curfew!\u201d\n\nHowever, the caption\u2019s claim doesn\u2019t hold up. Mbuzi Seller, the Kenyan comedian brandishing the whip in the footage, confirmed to France 24 that the video is comedic. Seller actually created the comedic skit to raise awareness about the importance of social distancing.\n\n\u201cI saw my fellow Kenyans out in the streets as if nothing was happening. I wondered if they thought that this virus was a joke and so I wanted to make a joke out of it myself, but this time to get people to understand just how serious the situation is,\u201d Seller told France 24 in a statement. \u201cSo I used my character to \u2018terrify\u2019 the population and encourage them to maintain a distance of one meter from others.\u201d\n\nSeller also emphasized that the whip was fake and that he hadn\u2019t been commissioned by the Kenyan government to make the skit, according to France 24. The Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any media reports about the Kenyan government calling upon the Maasai tribe to help enforce the country\u2019s mitigation measures.\n\nWhile the video does not show someone deputized by the Kenyan government to enforce the curfew, Kenyan police have been criticized for using violent methods to do so. At least 12 people in Kenya have been killed by police since the dusk-until-dawn curfew that started on March 27, the Washington Post reported.", "lang": "en"}
