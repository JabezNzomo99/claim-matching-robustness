He was born and raised in the Soviet Union, moved to the U.S. in 1980 and then moved back to Russia around 2009. In the U.S., he left no mark as a journalist but, after launching a travel agency in New York, was sued by creditors at least five times. In addition, former clients accuse him of stealing their money. He has never been a member of the Republican National Committee; in fact, it seems he has never even registered to vote in the United States.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "May 02, 2017", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-1917", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/fake-us-journalist-gop-member-on-russian-tv/28464241.html", "vclaim": "On April 18, the guests on \u201cStudio One,\u201d a political talk show on Russian state television\u2019s Channel One, discussed North Korea\u2019s failed test firing of a missile and the U.S. response. Among the experts taking part in the discussion was a person identified as an American journalist named Greg Vainer.\n\nOpening the show \u2013 which on this day was headlined \u201cWhere will the confrontation lead?\u201d \u2013 Studio One host Artem Sheinin asked: \u201cDo you know what is the best way to determine if some political event really disturbs people? \u2026When you get a phone call in the studio and the people on the other end tell you: \u2018Hi, we are on vacation but we are very much concerned about Trump\u2019s aggressive behavior with North Korea! Explain to us \u2013 will there be World War III or should we be planting our garden?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe discussion turned to the question of whether the U.S. is bluffing with North Korea, and whether North Korea takes the Americans seriously.\n\n\u201cThe White House right now is considering a very different scenario, and I will tell you what it is if you promise to keep it a secret,\u201d said one of the guests, identified as \u201cGreg Vainer, journalist (U.S.).\u201d Speaking Russian without the hint of an accent, Vainer continued: \u201cThere will be a trade quarantine introduced against North Korea.\u201d\n\nThe host interrupted: \u201cWait, on what side does the U.S. border North Korea to be able to impose such a quarantine?\u201d\n\nAs Vainer mumbled that China is also on board for the quarantine, all the other guests simultaneously started arguing with him. The host, meanwhile, started speaking about \u201chistorical\u201d parallels \u2013 how the U.S. \u201cpushed us, the Soviet Union, to self-destruction, and then pushed Iraq, so it\u2019s taken over by ISIS, just like they are now pushing North Korea for no obvious reason.\u201d\n\nAs the program proceeds, the \u201cAmerican journalist\u201d is repeatedly the target of arguments that the Russian guests inevitably win.\n\nChannel One is Russia\u2019s most popular TV channel, and it also offers free round-the-clock satellite broadcasts to all the countries of the former Soviet Union and to Eastern Europe. Channel One also maintains a YouTube channel with hundreds of thousands of subscribers.\n\n\u201cGreg Vainer\u201d appears frequently on other Russian TV channels, including NTV and St. Petersburg's Channel Five. He discusses various aspects of American foreign policy, including U.S. policy toward Russia, Ukraine and the Middle East, and well as U.S. domestic policy.\n\nDuring an appearance on Channel Five back on January 12, he was described as a \u201cprominent American journalist\u201d and a member of the Republican National Committee.\n\nHowever, Gennady Katsov, a Russian journalist based in New York, has identified \u201cGreg Vainer\u201d as a long-time acquaintance named Gregory Vinnikov. In a Facebook post, Katsov described Vinnikov as a former businessman and the owner of the Eastern Tours Agency in New York City \u2013 who, Katsov said, \u201cstole millions of dollars from his clients and fled to Saint Petersburg, Russia.\u201d\n\nKatsov also posted a link to the Facebook profile of Gregory Vinnikov, whose profile photo shows someone identical to the man identified on Russian TV as Greg Vainer.\n\nThe Moscow Times, an independent English-language newspaper in the Russian capital, ran a front-page article about Vinnikov last week, which was headlined: \u201cRussian TV Passes Off Corrupt Petersburg Entrepreneur as \u2018American Journalist\u2019.\u201d\n\nBy his own account, Gregory Vinnikov immigrated to the U.S. in 1980. It is not clear whether he was granted or even ever applied for U.S. citizenship.\n\nAccording to publicly available tax reports, Vinnikov owns a three-bedroom apartment in New Jersey in a high-end neighborhood across the Hudson River from Manhattan. According to New Jersey voter registration data, Vinnikov has never registered as voter in his state of residence or any other U.S. state.\n\nThe Republican Party\u2019s press office also confirmed to Polygraph.info that Vinnikov is not a member of the Republican National Committee.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2015, Vinnikov was involved in at least five court cases in the states of New York and New Jersey related to his consumer credit. From publicly available court information, two of the New Jersey court cases resulted in monetary judgments for $14,000. Those cases remain open, meaning that Vinnikov has not repaid those debts.\n\nIn New York, two court cases were brought against Vinnikov by American Express Bank, FSB. One of these, involving failure to pay $9,087.59, was settled on August 30, 2012. The other New York case, according to court data, is still \u201cactive.\u201d\n\nDuring his years living in the United Sates, Vinnikov has been the CEO of at least nine businesses.\n\nAll nine are currently inactive. His most recent firm \u2013 Eastern Tours Consolidated, Inc. \u2013 was established in October 1993 and registered on Ten East 39th Street, New York, according to the New York State Department of State. The New York State tax authorities declared the company inactive and annulled its license in October 2011.\n\nIn a 2012 profile of Vinnikov by the New York-based Russian-language newspaper Rusrek.com, journalist Alexander Grant cited former clients of Vinnikov, referring to them as \u201cvictims.\u201d According to Grant, Vinnikov stole thousands of dollars from clients after promising to expedite their acquisition of Russian passports and other documents, including visas, as well as airline tickets. Grant claims Vinnikov never provided these services, and instead \u201cfled\u201d back to Russia.\n\nAt the time of publication, the New York police had not responded to Polygraph.info\u2019s inquiry as to whether criminal charges have ever been brought against Gregory Vinnikov.", "lang": "en"}
