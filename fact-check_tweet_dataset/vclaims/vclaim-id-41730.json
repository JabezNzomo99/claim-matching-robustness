Its report said the party made the confirmation \"in a live broadcast on state TV,\" thus \"laying to rest\" rumors about Kim Jong Un's condition in recent days.\n\nThe facts: As of April 28, there are no reports from credible news organizations that carry confirmation or announcement from North Korea's Workers' Party about Kim Jong Un's status. Furthermore, North Korea's state media has not made any official statement yet about Kim Jong Un's condition or health.\n\nThe article has not been updated since it was published on April 25. As such, it ran counter to recent details and developments reported by other news outlets about Kim Jong Un after April 25.\n\nThe domain nycinews.com was registered only on March 11, 2020, according to its whois information. The website also does not have an About page, a list of staff members, or a way to contact its office.\n\nDue to North Korea's totalitarian government, news coming out of it is controlled by the state. As such, any news announced through North Korea's state TV would have also been carried by various news outlets.\n\nThe scarcity of details coming out of North Korea has fueled conflicting speculations about Kim Jong Un's condition, especially in connection with his weeks-long absence from public view as pointed out by news outlets like The New York Times on April 26.\n\nWhile there have been reports that the North Korean leader died due to a botched surgery as reported by TMZ on April 25, some outlets like CNN on April 26 and The Guardian on April 27 have also reported that Kim is \"alive and well,\" citing an adviser to South Korean president Moon Jae-in.\n\nOn April 26, news outlet The Mirror chronicled how North Korea announced in 2011 the death of Kim's father, Kim Jong-il, and said it may offer clues on how the country may be announcing the passing of their current leader.\n\nThe Mirror's article said North Korean state TV announced Kim Jong-il's death two days after it happened. The presenter was also dressed in black at the time of the announcement.", "lang": "en"}
