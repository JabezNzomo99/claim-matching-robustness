A spokesperson for Biden\u2019s campaign confirmed this is not in his plans.\n\nBiden has said he plans to roll back the tax cuts from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) that President Donald Trump signed into law for those making $400,000 or more, according to CNBC. In recent weeks, some social media users have been sharing a viral post claiming Biden will also raise taxes from 12 percent to 25 percent for families making $75,000.\n\n\u201cBidens (sic) tax rate on a family making 75000 dollars would go from 12% to 25%,\u201d the post reads. \u201cLET THAT SINK IN ALL YOU RIDING WITH BIDEN SUPORTERS (sic)!!\u201d (RELATED: Did Kamala Harris Call Joe Biden \u2018Trash\u2019?)\n\nThe current federal marginal tax rate for married couples filing jointly making $75,000 is 12 percent, according to the Internal Revenue Service, and for single filers making $75,000, the tax rate is 22 percent.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Biden has pledged to raise corporate taxes to 28 percent and proposed taxing income above $400,000 a 12.4 percent Social Security tax. \u201cIt is incorrect\u201d to state that Biden plans to raise taxes on families making less than $400,000, Garrett Watson, senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, told Check Your Fact.\n\n\u201cEven if full TCJA repeal was Biden\u2019s proposal, however, this claim still wouldn\u2019t be quite right, as a joint filer earning $75,000 in taxable income would be in the 15% tax bracket, not the 25% bracket,\u201d Watson explained in an email. \u201cFor single individuals earning $75K, full TCJA repeal would mean going from a 22% top marginal tax rate now to a 25% rate.\u201d\n\nMichael Gwin, a Biden campaign spokesman, told Check Your Fact that Biden would not raise taxes for those making less than $400,000.
