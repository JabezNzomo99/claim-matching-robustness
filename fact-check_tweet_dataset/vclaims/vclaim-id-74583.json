The measure reversed a 20-year-old law that blocked people without legal status from applying for a license. A large coalition of immigrant advocacy organizations argued that in the state that epitomizes American car culture, that ban made it difficult for people to get to work, drive their kids to school and run simple errands. The result, the advocates argued, was thousands of people on the road without licenses and without any way to make sure they knew how to drive.\n\nUnder AB 60, all that would be needed to get a license was proof of residency and the ability to pass a driver\u2019s test, both written and on-the-road.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown signed the bill in October 2013. It took effect January 2015.\n\nState officials predicted that about 500,000 people would apply in the first six months, with about another million people after three years. By April 2015, they had already hit the 500,000 mark.\n\n\"The interest in this program is far greater than anyone anticipated,\" said DMV director Jean Shiomoto in a press release.\n\nShiomoto might have been surprised, but the state had done a lot to make this happen.\n\nIn January 2014, Brown proposed spending $65 million to open five temporary offices and hire as many as 1,000 additional staffers to handle an application surge. He largely got what he wanted. The department opened four new offices and hired 900 people .\n\nIn November 2014, the Department of Motor Vehicles announced it would keep and stay open on Saturdays.\n\n\"DMV is committed to successfully implementing this new law to increase safety on California roads by putting licensed drivers behind the steering wheel,\" Shiomoto said.\n\nThe group NumbersUSA said that this year, more than half of all drivers' licenses issued in California went to undocumented immigrants. By the state\u2019s own tally, that is correct. What the group doesn\u2019t mention is that this is the result of a substantial state effort. First, lawmakers made it possible for over a million unauthorized residents to apply for a license, and then the state spent millions of dollars to speed the application process.\n\nThe statement had the right numbers but needs additional information.
