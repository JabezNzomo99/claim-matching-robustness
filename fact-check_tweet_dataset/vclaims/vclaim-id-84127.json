The claim is false; the video actually shows her inviting voters to eat noodles after the election.\n\nThe video has been shared repeatedly on Facebook, for example here where it has been watched 152,000 times in less than 24 hours after it was posted April 16, 2019.\n\nIt has an Indonesia-language caption which says: \u201cGrace Natalie (PSI) will throw a pork eating party after the presidential election\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nPSI is a reference to the Indonesian Solidarity Party that Natalie chairs, which supported Widodo in the April 17 elections. Here is her profile on the party\u2019s website.\n\nIndonesia held a presidential election on April 17. It is being contested by Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, and his sole challenger Prabowo Subianto. Here is AFP\u2019s latest report on the poll.\n\nEating pork is forbidden according to Islamic faith -- a religion adhered to by the majority of Indonesians.\n\nAnother April 16, 2019 Facebook post also shared the same video, with a caption that says, in Indonesian: \u201cThe calling from the PSI chairwoman: Let\u2019s eat pork after casting vote\u201d.\n\nBut Natalie does not say she will throw a \u201cpork eating party\u201d or invite people to eat the meat after the end of the elections.\n\nThe video in the misleading posts shows her saying: \u201cI\u2019m praying for you all to remain firm and help me fight the hoaxes. Don\u2019t be afraid to come to the polling stations because Mr. Jokowi has ensured the security and has deployed the police and the military to secure the voting process. One vote is highly valuable. And when this ends, let\u2019s eat noodles together. It\u2019s for you to decide which one.\u201d\n\nThe penultimate sentence of Natalie\u2019s speech is, in Indonesian: \u201cDan kalau semua ini sudah selesai, ayo kita makan bakmi sama-sama\u201d.\n\nThe word \u201cbakmi\u201d means \u201cnoodles\u201d in English. The Indonesian word for pork is \u201cbabi\u201d.\n\nIn this April 16, 2019 post on her Instagram handle @gracenat, Natalie said that she had been inviting people to eat noodles, not pork.\n\nThe caption says: \"Latest Hoax: Noodles become pork. Please listen to the video carefully. At the end of the video, I invite people to eat noodles, but it became pork. Please stop spreading HOAXES!\"\n\nShe posted the original full-length version of the video used in the misleading posts on her Instagram page:", "lang": "en"}
