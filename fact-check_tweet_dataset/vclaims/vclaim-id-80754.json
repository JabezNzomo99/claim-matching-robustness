That doesn\u2019t mean they speak a foreign language exclusively at home.\n\nData on the percentage of \"homes\" where a foreign language is spoken is harder to find.\n\nBut after crunching some 2014 census figures, , director of research for the conservative Center for Immigration Studies, told us that 48.3 percent of households in California \"have at least one person who speaks a language other than English at home.\"\n\n\"I would call it half,\" Camarota said in an email.\n\nHe added that foreign language households are often undercounted during census surveys.\n\nMore to the story\n\nBuchanan\u2019s statement is not far from the truth, when examining the numbers alone.\n\nBut he ignores figures about how many Californians speak English proficiently. Nineteen percent in the state report having limited English language skills, the in the nation, followed by 14 percent in Texas and 13 percent in New York, according to the Migration Policy Institute.\n\nThat means, however, that more than 80 percent of Californians report having a stronger set of English language skills, or speaking the language \"very well.\" Proficiency levels offer a more accurate look at how California and its many immigrants are adopting the country\u2019s primary language, said , a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, who studies immigrant populations.\n\nBuchanan\u2019s claim about foreign language speakers includes many who Hill said \"could be completely fluent in Spanish and English or English and Vietnamese. They could have really high levels of English fluency.\"\n\nHill added that \"If you\u2019re trying to make a point about immigrant integration, you\u2019re going to be more interested in understanding not how many people speak a different language, but how many don\u2019t speak English very well.\"\n\nWhen we asked Buchanan to explain his statement, his representative sent us links to that say more than half of Los Angeles, but not California as a whole, speaks a foreign language at home.\n\nBuchanan made two runs for the Republican presidential nomination, coming up short in 1992 and 1996. He also ran a failed bid for president in 2000 as a Reform Party candidate.\n\nDuring a conversation on NPR, Pat Buchanan said \"In half the homes in California, people speak a language other than English in their own homes.\"\n\nLooking at the numbers alone, he\u2019s close to correct.\n\nBut he fails to note that many of those who speak a foreign language at home also are fluent in English. He also omits the fact that only 19 percent of Californians, not half, are considered limited English speakers.\n\nBuchanan\u2019s statement contains some element of truth, but in the context of his conversation, it wrongly implies that half the state does not speak English. It ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\n\nWe rate his claim Mostly False.\n\nCORRECTION: This fact check has been corrected to show that English is the primary language in the United States. A previous version incorrectly stated it is the official language.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE \u2013 The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
