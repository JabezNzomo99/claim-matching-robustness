We also provide a timeline of the president\u2019s comments below.\n\nThe Threat of the Coronavirus\n\nIn an interview on CNN on April 1, Pence said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe the president has ever belittled the threat of the coronavirus.\u201d\n\nThat may be what the vice president believes. But he is wrong. The truth is that Trump has repeatedly downplayed the threat of the virus.\n\nFrom Jan. 22 to March 10, as we reported before, Trump made a series of statements minimizing the danger posed to the United States. (See our timeline below.)\n\nOn March 16, Trump reversed course, imposing social distancing guidelines for 15 days. The following day, he said at a press conference: \u201cThis is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.\u201d\n\nBut he soon sounded a different tone again.\n\nAs recently as March 24 at a Fox News virtual town hall, Trump likened the disease\u2019s impact to that of the flu or automobile accidents. At the time the president was considering, for economic reasons, whether to relax the social distancing guidelines he had imposed to combat the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.\n\nHe suggested he might ease the social distancing guidelines. \u201cI would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter,\u201d he said.\n\nOn March 29, the president abandoned that aspiration and announced the guidelines would remain in place until April 30.\n\nIn the CNN interview, Pence maintained that the president had been aware throughout of the seriousness of the coronavirus outbreak. Confronted by anchor Wolf Blitzer with statements by Trump minimizing the danger, Pence replied, \u201cThe president is an optimistic person. We\u2019ve been from the very beginning, when the president suspended all travel from China and stood up the White House coronavirus task force in January, we have been hoping for the best but planning for the worst, and that\u2019s been being worked out every single day.\u201d\n\nIn a coronavirus task force press briefing on March 15, Trump praised the task force members standing behind him, saying they have been \u201cworking around the clock\u201d and were \u201cdoing an incredible job.\u201d Then, he added, \u201cThis is a very contagious \u2014 this is a very contagious virus. It\u2019s incredible. But it\u2019s something that we have tremendous control over.\u201d\n\nThe next day, when asked about that statement, Trump attempted to reframe his past comments about the U.S. having the coronavirus \u201cunder control.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, when I\u2019m talking about control, I\u2019m saying we are doing a very good job within the confines of what we\u2019re dealing with,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about the virus, no, that\u2019s not under control for any place in the world.\u201d\n\nAt times, Trump has been clear that he meant the federal government\u2019s response to the pandemic is \u201cunder control,\u201d such as on Feb. 29 when talking about a \u201cnatural reflex\u201d among Democrats to criticize his actions.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ve done a great job,\u201d Trump said at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve gotten to know these professionals. They\u2019re incredible. And everything is under control. I mean, they\u2019re very, very cool. They\u2019ve done it, and they\u2019ve done it well. Everything is really under control. But when they put a mic in front of a Democrat, and the Democrat said \u2014 doesn\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on. \u2018How is Trump doing?\u2019 \u2018He\u2019s doing a terrible job.\u2019 Well, sadly, I\u2019d probably say the same about them.\u201d\n\nAt other times, however, Trump\u2019s \u201cunder control\u201d comments appear to be about the coronavirus itself. For example, on Feb. 24, Trump tweeted, \u201cThe Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA.\u201d\n\nOr on Feb. 26, when Trump said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very well under control. Now, it may get bigger, it may get a little bigger. It may not get bigger at all. We\u2019ll see what happens. But regardless of what happens, we are totally prepared.\u201d\n\nOr on Feb. 25 when he said at a business roundtable in India, \u201cIf you go back six months or three months ago, nobody would have ever predicted. But let\u2019s see, I think it\u2019s going to be under control. And I think I can speak for our country, for \u2014 our country is under control.\u201d\n\nThat same day during a press conference in India, Trump said: \u201cYou may ask about the coronavirus, which is very well under control in our country. We have very few people with it.\u201d\n\nMoving the Goal Posts on the Outbreak\n\nThe Trump administration has moved the goal posts dramatically when it comes to estimates of how many Americans will contract COVID-19.\n\nFor weeks, as he downplayed the disease\u2019s danger, Trump said there were just a small number of cases in the U.S. and that the disease would vanish. By the end of March, he was saying that without dramatic action like social distancing, as many as 2.2 million Americans could die.\n\nOn Feb. 10, when he suggested the disease would go away \u201cin April with the heat \u2014 as the heat comes in,\u201d Trump said, \u201cWe have 12 cases \u2014 11 cases, and many of them are in good shape now.\u201d (See our item \u201cWill the New Coronavirus \u2018Go Away\u2019 in April?\u201c)\n\nOn Feb. 26, the president said, \u201cAs they get better, we take them off the list, so that we\u2019re going to be pretty soon at only five people. And we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time.\u201d That same day, he also said, \u201cAnd again, when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that\u2019s a pretty good job we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nTrump was still downplaying the scope of the problem on March 4, when he said, \u201c[W]e have a very small number of people in this country [infected]. We have a big country.\u201d\n\nBut by the end of the month, Trump was painting a stark picture of the disease\u2019s potential toll. On March 29, when he announced he was extending social distancing guidelines until the end of April, he said as many as 2.2 million Americans could die of COVID-19 if the country failed to take decisive action.\n\nHe said, \u201cSo you\u2019re talking about 2.2. million deaths \u2014 2.2 million people from this. And so, if we can hold that down, as we\u2019re saying, to 100,000 \u2014 that\u2019s a horrible number \u2014 maybe even less, but to 100,000; so we have between 100- and 200,000 \u2014 we all, together, have done a very good job. But 2.2, up to 2.2 million deaths and maybe even beyond that.\u201d\n\nAt a White House briefing on March 31, federal health officials raised the upper limit of those who might die from the disease even with mitigation efforts to 240,000.\n\nSeveral times, Trump had compared the coronavirus outbreak to the seasonal flu, but in the March 29 task force briefing, Trump acknowledged that he had changed his mind about this.\n\n\u201cBut there were a lot of people that said \u2014 I thought about it. I said, \u2018Maybe we should ride it through.\u2019 You know, you always hear about the flu. I talk about it all the time. We had a bad flu season. We\u2019re in the midst of a bad flu season, Trump said. \u201cBut this is different. And part of this is the unknown, and part of it also is the viciousness of it.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, he repeated those remarks, but said the flu comparison came from \u201cmany friends\u201d and \u201ca lot of people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019ve had many friends, business people, people with great, actually, common sense, they said, \u2018Why don\u2019t we ride it out?\u2019 A lot of people have said, a lot of people have thought about it, \u2018Ride it out, don\u2019t do anything, just ride it out, and think of it as the flu.\u2019 But it\u2019s not the flu,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThat\u2019s a marked difference from his earlier comments comparing COVID-19 to the flu. For example, in the March 24 virtual town hall, Trump said, \u201cAnd actually this year we\u2019re having a bad flu season, but we lose thousands of people a year to the flu. We never turn the country off.\u201d\n\nAnd in a March 9 tweet, he said deaths from the flu average \u201cbetween 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!\u201d\n\nIn a Feb. 26 press conference, Trump made some confusing remarks that wrongly suggested the fatality rate for the flu is \u201cmuch higher\u201d than the rate for COVID-19, as we wrote. So far, the worldwide fatality rate for COVID-19 has been higher, but, as we have explained, the rate may end up falling as more is known about the actual number of cases.\n\nAs for the seasonal flu, or influenza, it does kill thousands of Americans each year, and infects millions. For the 2019-2020 flu season, 39 million to 55 million people had flu illnesses in the U.S., according to preliminary estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC estimates this season\u2019s flu had caused between 24,000 and 63,000 deaths. Since 2010, influenza in the U.S. has caused between 9 million and 45 million illnesses annually, the CDC says, with 12,000 to 61,000 of those resulting in death.\n\nTrump also has made comparisons between the coronavirus pandemic and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, but as we\u2019ve written, the two viruses are very different. Peter Jay Hotez, a professor and dean of the tropical medicine school at Baylor College of Medicine, told us that the novel coronavirus, which is known as SARS-CoV-2, is considerably more transmissible and more lethal than the H1N1 influenza virus. \u201cThe urgency to contain this coronavirus is so much greater than the H1N1 2009 one was,\u201d he said.\n\nHere is a timeline of statements the president has made about the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, beginning two days after the first case in the country was confirmed:\n\nCorrection, April 14: We originally said our timeline of Trump\u2019s statements began on Jan. 24. It begins on Jan. 22.", "lang": "en"}
