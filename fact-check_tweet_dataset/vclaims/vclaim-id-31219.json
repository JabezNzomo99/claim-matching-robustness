He\u2019s just sleeping.\n\nThe photograph was first posted online in 2016. It was originally shared in the \u201cTIFU\u201d (today I f*cked up) section of Reddit under the caption: \u201cTIFU by falling asleep at the job on my second day.\u201d This picture was then subsequently posted to \u201cPSBattles,\u201d a section of Reddit dedicated to photoshopping images, and quickly became a viral meme:\n\nShortly after the picture went viral, this sleepy individual (a Redditor by the name of TheOrangeDuke) spoke with the Huffington Post about his internet infamy:\n\n\u201cOne of the associates noticed me sleeping,\u201d he told The Huffington Post. \u201cAnd it just went downhill from there!\u201d The lighthearted staff decided to snap an office photo with the slumbering intern. When he awoke, he found the picture so funny that he posted it on Reddit \u2026 And believe it or not, TheOrangeDuke, who would like for him and his company to remain anonymous, did not get fired for catching zzz\u2019s at work. He\u2019s on his third day of his internship and had a perfectly logical reason for his catnap. \u201cI have been diagnosed with anemia, as shown by my amazing skin color, that causes me to be ultra sleepy!\u201d he said.\n\nCNBC also interviewed \u201cTheOrangeDuke,\u201d identified as Eduard Paraschivescu, in 2016:", "lang": "en"}
