To illustrate this, they first shared this graph on Twitter.\n\nYou might expect this to show the results of the last election, or current voting intention in North East Somerset.\n\nThis isn\u2019t what the graph shows.\n\n\u201cImagine that the result in your constituency was expected to be very close between the Conservative candidate and the Liberal Democrat candidate, and none of the other parties were competitive [emphasis added]. In this scenario, which party would you vote for?\u201d\n\n38% of all respondents (not just those likely to vote) said the Conservative candidate Jacob Rees-Mogg and 32% said the Liberal Democrat candidate Nick Coates.\n\nThe exact wording of the question is included in the small-print below the graph, and the local branch told us they had done that in part because there wasn't enough room to include it in full in the text of the tweet. However, the text is so small that it cannot reasonably be expected that most people will notice it.\n\nThe question wording forces a hypothetical scenario on respondents which encourages them to choose either the Conservative or the Lib Dem candidate.\n\nThis is not a good way to understand how people actually intend to vote in the area. When people go into the polling booth, they do not see a message like this telling them which parties are not competitive.\n\nThe standard way to test voting intention is to ask people \u201cIf there were a general election held tomorrow and the following candidates stood in your North East Somerset constituency, which party would you vote for?\u201d\n\nThe same poll, commissioned from Survation by the Liberal Democrats, also did this. After accounting for likelihood to vote and removing don\u2019t know and refusal responses, the results show 44% would vote for the Conservatives\u2019 candidate, 28% for the Liberal Democrats\u2019 and 14% for Labour\u2019s.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats did also tweet these figures in a follow up to the graph, but did not lead with this and those figures were much less widely shared.\n\nSo while the Liberal Democrats are firmly the second place candidate, the gap to the Conservatives is much larger than the graph in their leading tweet suggests.", "lang": "en"}
