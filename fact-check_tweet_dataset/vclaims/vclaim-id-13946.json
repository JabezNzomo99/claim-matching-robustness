The image was previously widely shared in 2017, along with the same claim that Mr Corbyn is visible in the photo.\n\nThe image itself is real: it is a photograph of IRA member Bobby Sands\u2019 funeral on May 7, 1981, following his death while on hunger strike in prison. However, while the image does show Gerry Adams and members of the IRA, other photographs from the funeral clearly show that the man pictured is not Mr Corbyn.\n\nIn an email to Full Fact, the Bobby Sands Trust told us that the man is actually Jim Gibney, then part of the National H-Block/Armagh Committee (a pressure group campaigning for political status for Republican prisoners), and now an aide to Sinn F\u00e9in Senator Niall O\u2019Donnghaile. Gibney can be seen in this picture (fifth from the right) from a few months earlier in 1981.", "lang": "en"}
