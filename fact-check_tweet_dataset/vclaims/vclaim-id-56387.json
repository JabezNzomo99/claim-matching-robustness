While some have posted that it shows angry Indians running towards China to retaliate after the latter\u2019s attack in the Galwan valley, the others have posted (archived) that it shows Indian army running during the Chinese attack and falling on each other. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of Indians running towards China to retaliate after the Galwan attack. Fact: The video is found to be in circulating on the internet at least from March 2020. But, the India-China Galwan border clash took place in June 2020. So, the video is not related to the Galwan incident. Also, many similar videos related to Myanmar jade mines were found on the internet. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, the same video was found to be uploaded on YouTube in March 2020. Also, when searched with the TikTok username on the YouTube video, the same video was found to be uploaded on TikTok on 25 March 2020. So, the video is not related to the recent India-China Galwan border clash, which took place in June 2020.\n\nIt was found that many users have commented on the posts that the video is related to a Jade mine in Myanmar. While FACTLY could not independently verify whether this exact video is related to Myanmar, many similar videos related to Jade mines in Myanmar were found on the internet, which can be seen here, here, and here.\n\nAlso, similar visuals can be seen in multiple news articles published by various prominent news agencies on Jade miners in Myanmar. The visuals show miners running in the mines to find the Jade mineral.\n\nTo sum it up, old and unrelated video of people running down a steep slope falsely linked to India-China Galwan border clash.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
