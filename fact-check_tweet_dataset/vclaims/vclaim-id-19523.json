However, there are reports that the state flag will soon be permanently removed.Many people have fallen for this false claim, including Geeta Phogat.Times Fact Check cropped the image and ran a reverse-image search on it on Google to find an article published on a website called Kashmir News Observer in November, 2016, carrying the same photo.This proves that the photo is three years old and is not one clicked after August 5, 2019, the day Home Minister Amit Shah presented the resolution to strike down Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir.Times Fact Check reached out to TOI Srinagar reporter Saleem Pandit and asked if the J&K state flag has been removed from atop the civil secretariat. He responded saying both the flags are still there and that the photo being shared with the false claim is old.A simple search on Twitter with keywords 'Kashmir Flag' will take you to a video tweeted by news agency ANI on August 7, 2019 showing both Tricolour and the J&K flag atop the civil secretariat. The tweet said, \"Jammu & Kashmir flag along with Tricolor atop the Civil Secretariat at Srinagar; Article370 was abrogated and Jammu & Kashmir was made a Union Territory (UT) with legislature, on 5th August.\"Times Fact Check has found the claim that the J&K flag has been removed from atop the civil secretariat already to be false. The photo used to make this claim is a digitally-manipulated form of an old photo.", "lang": "en"}
