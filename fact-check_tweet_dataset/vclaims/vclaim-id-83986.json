While many on social media posted selfies with their inked fingers, there was also a section of voters which returned home frustrated as their name could not be found on the voter list. In a video made by a person named Abhishek Arora, residents from Hapur, UP, complained that a majority of members of some Dalit, Muslim families in about 15 districts could not cast their vote as their names were not to be found on the voter list. They demanded that re-polling be done on those seats.\n\nA freelance journalist Neha Dixit who writes for various publications such as Outlook and Caravan also reported on Twitter that Dalits were being withheld from voting in Eta Constituency and appealed to the Election Commission to act as soon as possible.\n\nA Facebook user called Gaurav Pant also wrote about how he could not find either his or his family members\u2019 name in the voter list in Nodia.\n\nWe will follow this issue closely and report other instances of such discrepancies and the Election Commission\u2019s response if any.", "lang": "en"}
