Missouri third district congressional candidate Republican Chad Bicknell, posted his thoughts about the statement on Facebook:\n\n\"Andrew Yang for President 2020 tonight bribed 10 families at $12,000 dollars each to vote for him. This is a blatant violation of FEC rules and is automatic disqualification to run for any office.\"\n\nShould Yang really be out of the race? Turns out the answer isn\u2019t that simple.\n\nWe reached out to the Federal Election Commission to see if Bicknell\u2019s claim holds up. FEC spokeswoman Judith Ingram said Yang\u2019s scenario is not addressed in the Federal Election Campaign Act or commission rules.\n\nNormally, she said, the Yang campaign would reach out to the FEC for an advisory opinion to assess the legality. However, three of the commission\u2019s six seats are vacant, so no ruling can be made to guide Yang\u2019s team through this \"legal gray area,\" as Ingram calls it.\n\nWe reached out to experts from Common Cause and the Campaign Legal Center, two watchdog organizations, to see what they make of Bicknell\u2019s claim.\n\nPaul S. Ryan, vice president for policy and litigation at Common Cause, said there is no precedent for Yang\u2019s plan in FEC rules and, therefore, nothing to suggest it\u2019s a blatant violation.\n\nRyan noted Yang\u2019s proposal draws the FEC\u2019s \"personal use prohibition\" into question. The rule bans personal \"use of funds in a campaign account of a candidate (or former candidate) to fulfill a commitment, obligation or expense of any person.\"\n\nTherein lies the unanswered question: Are these families considered to be \"any person?\"\n\nCorey Goldstone, spokesman for the Campaign Legal Center, thinks so.\n\nThe personal use prohibition\u2019s purpose is \"to prevent donors from having their money go to line a random family\u2019s pocket,\" he said. \"Campaign funds are meant to go to services provided for the campaign.\"\n\nIf Ryan were Yang\u2019s lawyer, he\u2019d argue Yang\u2019s \"freedom dividend\" is a separate product. Once the money is handed over, it would no longer be considered part of Yang\u2019s campaign funds, he said.\n\n\"It\u2019s a thing. It\u2019s a product. It\u2019s a campaign promotional product analogous to Andrew Yang,\" he said.\n\nBut, as both Ryan and Goldstone pointed out, none of this really matters considering those three open commission spots. Until at least one of those seats is filled, questions regarding campaign finance law will go unanswered.\n\nBicknell cited the FEC. After we reached out to him to check his sources, he updated his post with the \"Expenditures to Influence Voting\" law. The law prohibits candidates from making any payments to any person in exchange for a vote.\n\nYang didn\u2019t outright ask that these families vote for him, so this law may not apply, Ryan said. He doubted the Justice Department would attempt a prosecution based on how the law has been enforced in the past.", "lang": "en"}
