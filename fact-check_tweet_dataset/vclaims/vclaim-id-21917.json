They\u2019re the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they\u2019d still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific,\u201d the meme quotes him as saying.\n\nThe quote did not appear in People magazine, nor was it found on any reputable website. The quote has been debunked by various news outlets since its first appearance in 2015.\n\nIn 1988, Trump was interviewed by talk show host Oprah Winfrey on her program about a possible foray into politics; the meme features a screenshot from this interview. Trump told Winfrey that he probably wouldn\u2019t be interested in running for president, but did state that he gets \u201ctired of seeing the country ripped off.\u201d\n\nIn the years thereafter, Trump continued to speak about a possible run for the White House; he briefly ran for the Reform Party\u2019s presidential nomination in 2000.\n\nHowever, the quote in question is fabricated. It could not be found anywhere credible online, and a spokesperson for People told The Daily Caller that it does not appear in any of its issues.\n\nThe image initially surfaced after Trump announced his 2016 presidential campaign and has proliferated throughout the internet ever since. The meme is similar to another fake quote about former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton that claims she called Democratic voters \u201cjust plain stupid.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
