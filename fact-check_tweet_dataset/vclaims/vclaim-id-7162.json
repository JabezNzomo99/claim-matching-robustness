Clapper Jr., who was the director of national intelligence under former President Barack Obama, that were made on \u201cThe View\u201d on Tuesday. But Mr. Clapper never said what Mr. Trump claimed he did. In fact, he said the opposite.\n\nJoy Behar: \u201cSo I ask you, was the F.B.I. spying on Trump\u2019s campaign?\u201d Mr. Clapper: \"No, they were not. They were spying on, a term I don\u2019t particularly like, but on what the Russians were doing. Trying to understand were the Russians infiltrating, trying to gain access, trying to gain leverage or influence, which is what they do.\u201d Ms. Behar: \u201cWell, why doesn\u2019t he like that? He should be happy.\u201d Mr. Clapper: \"He should be. I mean, Russia \u2014 it\u2019s one of the reasons I wrote my book, was the threat Russia poses because they are bent on undermining our system. And that\u2019s what they did, and had a lot of success during the course of the election.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Mr. Clapper used the word \u201cspy\u201d to describe intelligence gathering on Russian efforts to influence the election. He explicitly denied that the F.B.I. \u201cspied\u201d on Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nThere is no evidence that the intelligence agents planted an informant inside Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign to spy on him for political purposes.\n\nAs The New York Times has reported, \u201cF.B.I. agents sent an informant to talk to two campaign advisers only after they received evidence that the pair had suspicious contacts linked to Russia during the campaign.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
