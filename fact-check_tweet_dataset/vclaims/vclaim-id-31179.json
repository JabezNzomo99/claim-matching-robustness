However, after realising his mistake, Tharoor put another tweet saying: \"It still doesn't alter the message, the fact is that former PMs also enjoyed popularity abroad.\"\n\nTo verify the claim made by the Congress leader, we ran a reverse search on the image. We found that the image was clicked in 1955 in USSR.\n\nWe also found an article published on the website of Russian newspaper Magnitogorsk Metal about the same event.\n\nThe article contains the viral image along that Shashi Tharoor claimed to be of US, with another picture of the same event from a different angle.\n\nThe author Nikolay Znamensky claimed that he was in Magnitogorsk, Russia, when Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi had visited the city. Recollecting the memories, he mentioned in the article: \"In August 1955, Jawaharlal Nehru came to Magnitogorsk with his daughter Indira Gandhi.\"\n\nHowever, we found that Nehru-Gandhi's Soviet trip started on June 7, 1955, and ended on June 23, 1955. We also found some media reports of the same event.\n\nThus, it is clear that the viral image was clicked in 1955 during Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi's USSR visit.", "lang": "en"}
