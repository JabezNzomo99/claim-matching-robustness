Although Southgate is most likely a fan of his club\u2019s unofficial slogan, he did not have the song\u2019s lyrics scrawled across his waistcoat:\n\nEdwards\u2019 attire during the World Cup has drawn a fair amount of media attention, with The Guardian reporting that Marks & Spencer, the official suit supplier to the England team, saw a 35% increase in waistcoat sales thanks to the \u201cGareth Southgate effect.\u201d The clothing company even announced a national \u201cWaistcoat Day\u201d in an attempt to bring the team luck during the quarter finals:\n\nM&S (Official Tailor to the England team) has been proud to see Gareth Southgate sporting his M&S waistcoat on the sidelines for all four of England\u2019s games. And in a term many have coined the \u2018Southgate Effect\u2019, waistcoats have been flying off the shelves of M&S stores and into the online baskets on M&S.com. Sales of all M&S waistcoats have gone up by 35%. With 57 waistcoats available at M&S, starting from \u00a319.50, there\u2019s a waistcoat for everyone to show their support this Saturday. David Binns, Head of Menswear Buying at M&S said, \u201cEngland have reached the quarter finals, and frankly, we could not be more excited. With some saying THE waistcoat has been bringing the team extra luck we thought how better to mark the big game than launching National Waistcoat Day. Best of luck to the team \u2013 we hope they bring it home!\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, plenty of images of Southgate in his signature waistcoat are available, and none of those genuine photographs features the words \u201cIt\u2019s Coming Home\u201d visible on his clothing.\n\nHere\u2019s a photograph of Gareth Southgate, as well as a close up look at his navy blue waistcoat, in which the words \u201cIt\u2019s Coming Home\u201d are nowhere to be found:", "lang": "en"}
