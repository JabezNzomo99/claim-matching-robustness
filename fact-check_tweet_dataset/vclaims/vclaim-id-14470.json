The man in the video is neither a candidate from the Congress nor the BJP. The man is identified as Mohd Umar Siddique, former chairman of Nagar Palika Parishad in Uttarakhand's Jaspur. Interestingly, there is a striking resemblance between Siddique and Parikh.\n\nWhen we searched the Internet, we found an article on news portal Rajyasameeksha.org.\n\nThe article mentioned that during the campaigning for Udham Singh Nagar municipal polls, Siddique's pants fell off.\n\nTaking this as a reference, we reached out to Siddique. He told India Today, \"Unfortunately, my pants did drop off while I was campaigning for polls last month.\"\n\nWhen asked about which party he was associated with, Siddique said, \"I was earlier with the BSP and now with Uttarakhand Kranti Dal but have no connection with the BJP or the Congress.\"\n\nSpeaking to India Today, Parikh who is contesting polls from Rajasthan's Masuda said, \"The man in the video is not me. I rarely wear pant-shirt during campaigning. I mostly wear traditional kurta-pyjama.\"\n\nBased on our findings, we established that the man in the video is neither a Congress nor a BJP candidate.\n\nAlso read: Twitter posted a blank tweet.
