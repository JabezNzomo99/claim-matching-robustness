The claim is false; the woman in the video said she had been harassed by a man in China and received little help from the local police.\n\nThe video, posted on July 13, 2019 by Facebook user Rico Hiew here, has been viewed more than 80,000 times and shared more than 1,600 times.\n\nThe video shows a woman crying and talking in Chinese to the camera.\n\nThe post's Chinese language caption translates to English as:\n\n\u201cSee how Malaysia\u2019s security acts\n\n Cheating Chinese people again\n\n Most of the Chinese women \n\n Are tricked into going to Malaysia\n\n They owe a lot of agency fees\u201d\n\nThe caption ends with a hashtag saying: \u201cGo and find help at the Chinese embassy.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nHiew also posted the same video in a public Facebook group with more than 1.1 million members here. The post has been shared more than 2,400 times.\n\nThe claim in the misleading posts is false; the woman in the video was actually talking about being harassed by a man in China.\n\nHer comments translate to English as: \u201cEveryone in society, I\u2019m begging you, guys, please protect and save me! My name is Pei Xin, and I live in Huashan district, Ma\u2019anshan city, Anhui province.\n\n\u201cEarly this year, I was harassed by a man called Guo Yinan. At first he claimed he would come to my house and knock at my door. And now he keeps telling others I\u2019m his girlfriend.\n\n\u201cIt happened from January to July this year - a total of six months.\n\n\u201cIn February I went to Shatang Police Station (a police station in Huashan district) to report this case, but it was not accepted.\n\n\u201cToday I called Huoli Police Station in Ma\u2019anshan where I live (nearby) for help. The police officer said: \u2018Your case has been filed, and we cannot do anything unless he comes to your house with a knife to kill you.\u2019\u201d\n\nHuashan is a district in Ma\u2019anshan city, in China\u2019s eastern Anhui province. Huashan and Ma\u2019anshan are located on a map here.\n\nA keyword search found the video was posted on the woman's Weibo account, but the video and the woman\u2019s Weibo account, @\u6625\u79cb\u4e24\u4e0d\u6cbe-, are no longer online. A screenshot of her post -- dated July 11, 2019 -- is still available in this report by Fujian-based radio station FM1036 on July 16, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the FM1036 report:\n\nThe caption of the woman\u2019s Weibo post translates to English as: \u201cReally, after I called the police, the officers did nothing but hang up on me. This man still harasses me constantly; what on earth does he want me to do? Now I\u2019d rather the man would do something to me, or he who hides in the shadows would never be punished. Sina, do you want to continue deleting my videos in seconds?\u201d\n\n\u201cSina\u201d refers to the China tech firm that owns Weibo, China\u2019s microblogging website.\n\nPolice in Huashan district issued a statement on Weibo here on July 16, 2019, about the video and the alleged harassment case.\n\nThe first sentence of the police statement says: \u201cAround 4 pm on July 11, Ma\u2019anshan resident Pei posted a video on her Weibo account @\u6625\u79cb\u4e24\u4e0d\u6cbe- claiming that she was threatened and harassed by Guo, and the district police station ignored her report.\u201d\n\nThe second paragraph of the statement states: \u201cIn January this year, Guo bought a bracelet from Pei through WeChat at a price of 1,000 yuan. Guo later believed the bracelet was a counterfeit, and he asked Pei several times for a refund but she refused. The two parties later had a dispute. After investigation, the bracelet sold by Pei was indeed found to be a counterfeit. And Pei\u2019s allegations in the video -- that she was threatened and harassed by Guo and that the police refused to accept her case -- were all fabricated. Her video gained more than 40 million views, causing a very bad social impact.\u201d\n\nThe police further said that they gave Pei \u201ccriminal coercive measures\u201d for \u201csuspected crimes of provocation, and the case is being investigated further.\u201d\n\nShortly after the police posted their statement, also on July 16, 2019, Weibo announced they suspended Pei\u2019s Weibo account.\n\nThe alleged harassment case was also reported by Chinese media sites such as Beijing News here and China News here.", "lang": "en"}
