Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of a Mullah being beaten for trying to rape a 5-year-old girl in Ambala (Haryana). Fact: The man beaten up in the video is Pavan Kumar, a Hindu, not a \u2018Mullah\u2019 (or Muslim). He was beaten up by the women as he was sexually harassing three girls. He was not beaten when he tried to rape a girl. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched on Google with the keywords, many articles with similar visuals were found in the search results. In the \u2018Dainik Bhaskar\u2019 article, the same video can be seen. From the article, it can be read that the accused was beaten up as he was sexually harassing three girls on their way to school. In the \u2018ANI\u2019 article, it can be read that the accused used to behave vulgarly with the girls and also, used to flash his private parts. He was beaten up for sexually harassing three girls on their way to school.\n\n\n\nWhen FACTLY has contacted Sunita Daka (SHO Women Police Station), she has confirmed that this person was arrested based on the complaint that he was sexually harassing three girls (Two girls \u2013 Age 15 and One girl \u2013 Age 6). She has also clarified that the accused is a Hindu, not a Muslim. His name is Pawan Kumar (the same can be seen in the news articles).\n\nTo sum it up, the man beaten up in the video is not a Muslim. He was beaten up for sexually harassing three girls.\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
