The report uses an economy-wide model to estimate what the effect of the agreement would be once the U.S. economy has adjusted to the full implementation of the law.\n\nFull implementation is assumed to be six years after the rewritten trade agreement, known as USMCA for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, enters in force. \u201cEstimates indicate that U.S. real GDP [gross domestic product] would grow by 0.35 percent ($68.2 billion) and employment would grow by 0.12 percent (about 176,000 jobs),\u201d the report says.\n\nNote that the report says \u2153 of a point of GDP, not \u00bd a point as Kudlow claimed. And it says 176,000 after six years, not every year.\n\n\u201cThe way ITC writes it is ambiguous/confusing,\u201d the White House official said in an email. \u201cBasically, combined, both are right. It\u2019s 176k per year once fully implemented, which is year 6.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe economy-wide model estimates the U.S. economy\u2019s complete adjustment to the full implementation of USMCA, which is assumed to be year 6 after USMCA enters into force,\u201d the report says. \u201cTherefore, the estimates show the impact of the modeled provisions after the economy has responded to the changes in USMCA.\u201d\n\nMoreover, USITC spokeswoman Peg O\u2019Laughlin confirmed to The Fact Checker that this model is the standard way the USITC evaluates trade agreements. Thus, there should be no confusion on the part of White House officials.\n\nO\u2019Laughlin added that the report offers \u201cno year-by-year numbers\u201d and looked only at the number of jobs created after six years. \u201cIt was a one-year number,\u201d she said. Thus the report makes no prediction about what would happen after seven, eight or nine years \u2014 and certainly does not say 176,000 jobs per year.\n\nWe often warn readers to skeptically view any predictions of jobs created from trade deals \u2014 here\u2019s a fact check of a Four-Pinocchio claim by then-President Barack Obama about a job estimate involving the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2014 as such estimates rarely match with the reality. But it\u2019s worth noting that even a gain of 176,000 jobs after six years (effectively 29,000 a year until full implementation is reached) is relatively small. The U.S. economy has gained more than 176,000 jobs in a single month 19 times since Trump took the oath of office.\n\nKudlow suggests no action is needed to deal with a possible economic slowdown because of the rewrite of NAFTA. But he incorrectly claims the 180,000 estimate generated by the USITC represents a yearly gain in jobs \u2014 and suggests the effect on jobs would be felt immediately. Instead it\u2019s an estimate for the number of jobs created after six years \u2014 or beyond the hoped-for second Trump term.\n\nWe wavered between Three and Four Pinocchios. At least the number was not made out of whole cloth, even if White House officials apparently don\u2019t know how to read USITC reports. Kudlow earns Three Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
