The post claims this proves foreigners back Widodo\u2019s 2019 re-election bid. The image has been manipulated from a stock photo with no links to Widodo that is used online to promote a custom T-shirt business.\n\nThe post was shared to a Widodo supporters\u2019 Facebook group on November 26, 2018, with a caption: \u201cEven foreigners love Jokowi, babe. Dear my beloved friends from all over Indonesia, please stay loyal to him until April next year. Show your thumbs to Mr. Jokowi. #2019JokowiAgain.\u201d\n\nIndonesia will hold a presidential election in April 2019 with Widodo running against a sole challenger, Prabowo Subianto.\n\nThe image shows what looks to be a family of four in white T-shirts that have the hashtag #2019MELBOURNEPASTIPILIHJOKOWI.\n\nThis translates to: #2019MelbourneSurelyVotesForJokowi. Melbourne is one of the major cities in Australia.\n\nThe manipulated image also has text that says: \u201cEven foreigners love Jokowi. What about you???\u201d.\n\nReverse image results show that the image has been used frequently for customised clothing business in the past, such as this one from a printing firm named Lyon\u2019s Prints and this from an Indonesian store for its Chinese-year-themed t-shirt product, and again here on Amazon.\n\nBelow is the misleading image on the left, and the image from Amazon on the right.", "lang": "en"}
