Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d last week prompted no shortage of confusion and misleading claims on social media about what the ambitious environmental proposal would do.\n\nOne popular Facebook post spread the claim that \u201cSandy Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s \u2018NEW GREEN DEAL\u2019 Calls For End To Air Travel & To Build Trains Over The Oceans,\u201d referring to the New York Democrat by her high school nickname.\n\nBut the non-binding House resolution \u2014 which recognizes \u201cthe duty of the Federal Government to create a Green New Deal\u201d \u2014 does not call for ending air travel or building rail lines over any ocean. A companion resolution was also introduced in the Senate.\n\nThe language of the Facebook post mirrors the text of a headline on the conservative website The Gateway Pundit, but it doesn\u2019t come from the text of the actual resolution.\n\nInstead, it might stem from an interpretation of, or confusion over, documents about the resolution circulated by Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office.\n\nAn \u201coverview\u201d of the resolution that was provided to NPR, for example, pledged to \u201cbegin work immediately on Green New Deal bills to put the nuts and bolts on the plan described in this resolution.\u201d The outline included this about infrastructure and industrial projects: \u201cTotally overhaul transportation by massively expanding electric vehicle manufacturing, build charging stations everywhere, build out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary, create affordable public transit available to all, with goal to replace every combustion-engine vehicle.\u201d (Italic emphasis ours.)\n\nAt another point, in explaining its 10-year greenhouse gas emission goal, the outline says \u201cwe aren\u2019t sure that we\u2019ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.\u201d A now-deleted blog post on Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s House website included similar language.\n\nPeople can debate the choice of words used in those background materials, but the actual resolution introduced in Congress does not include any language suggesting an \u201cend to air travel\u201d or about building trains \u201cover the oceans.\u201d\n\nThe resolution outlines broad goals such as, reaching \u201cnet-zero greenhouse gas emissions\u201d; creating \u201cmillions of good, high-wage jobs\u201d; investing in infrastructure; guaranteeing future generations clean air and water, and \u201cclimate and community resiliency\u201d; and more.\n\nThe only reference to trains is a call to invest in \u201chigh-speed rail\u201d as part of an effort to overhaul \u201ctransportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nU.S. House. \u201cH. Res. 109, Recognizing the duty of the Federal Government to create a Green New Deal.\u201d (as introduced 7 Feb 2019.)", "lang": "en"}
