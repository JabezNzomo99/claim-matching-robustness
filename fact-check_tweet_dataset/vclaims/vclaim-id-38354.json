About 1 percent happen after the fetus reaches the point of viability. In short, the president is describing something that rarely happens and that no Democrat is calling for anyway.\n\nSens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and some others who competed in the presidential primary, said they favored having no restrictions on abortion. (See these candidate surveys from The Washington Post and the New York Times to get a sense of where each Democrat stood on reproductive rights.)\n\nTrump appears to have stopped repeating his claim after Super Tuesday (March 3), when Biden solidified his lead. The last recorded instance of Trump making this abortion claim is March 2 at a campaign rally in North Carolina. It was the last Trump rally held before lockdowns related to the novel coronavirus began.\n\n\u201c\u2018Abortion until the moment of birth\u2019 does not exist \u2014 it\u2019s a boogeyman abortion opponents have created to frighten voters and derail rational conversation about constitutional rights,\u201d Watson wrote. \u201cNobody \u2018supports\u2019 it, and nobody does it. No patient ever asks a physician to end her pregnancy \u2018the moment before birth,\u2019 and no physician would agree to do it.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s rulings in Roe and Planned Parenthood v. Casey say states may ban abortion after the fetus reaches viability, the point at which it can sustain life, which happens at or near the end of the second trimester. States with such bans must allow an exception \u201cto preserve the life or health of the mother.\u201d\n\nContrast that with Sanders, who said \u201cabortion should be safe, legal and accessible to every person who chooses it.\u201d Or with Warren, who said she favored having no restrictions. \u201cThe decision whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term is one of the most personal decisions anyone can make,\u201d Warren told the Times when asked about gestational-age limits. \u201cWe must not allow politicians to make this decision for parents and families just so they can score cheap political points.\u201d\n\nThe official pointed to this line in the Times report: \u201cAsked if they supported restrictions after 24 weeks \u2014 roughly when a healthy fetus can survive outside the womb, though viability varies from pregnancy to pregnancy \u2014 only Mr. [Joe] Sestak said yes. (Ms. [Tulsi] Gabbard, who did not complete the survey, has also said she supports restrictions in the third trimester.)\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s more to the story, though. Sanders and Warren both told the Times for the same survey that they would codify Roe. And they both co-sponsored the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, which prohibits states from banning abortion before the fetus reaches viability (the Roe and Casey framework).\n\n\u201cNot all Democrats agree on the best legislative response to abortion regulation,\u201d Watson wrote. \u201cSome want to codify the Roe standard. Others want to regulate abortion like every other area of heath care, which in most states would mean deregulating it (lifting all restrictions except generally applicable ones about patient safety, facility and clinician licensure, etc.) and trusting patients and doctors to make individual decisions about what is right for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a companion case to Roe, Doe v. Bolton, the Supreme Court defined the \u2018health exception\u2019 in a wide-open fashion, allowing for \u2018familial,\u2019 \u2018economic\u2019 and \u2018emotional\u2019 considerations,\u201d Aden wrote in an email. \u201cThis completely subjective \u2018health exception\u2019 is what gave us the \u2018abortion on demand\u2019 regime we\u2019ve had since Roe. It is certainly true that a small minority of abortions occur in the late gestational ages (after about 20 weeks), and that only a few abortionists practice very late-term abortions such as third trimester abortions, but no abortion doctor would face any legal penalty for doing one based on virtually any subjective reason provided.\u201d\n\nThe statistics hardly justify Trump\u2019s description of babies being ripped from the womb \u2014 a horror story he has repeated dozens of times. About 1 percent of abortions happen after the point of viability, so the cases at issue in this debate would be relatively rare.\n\nTrump also grossly exaggerated. Supporting abortion rights is not the same as supporting abortions. The Democrats in the presidential race appeared to be somewhat divided on abortion regulations, with some saying they favored no restrictions and others saying they favored limits based on settled law and Supreme Court rulings. They were not all marching in lockstep, as Trump invariably claims. Biden never went that far.", "lang": "en"}
