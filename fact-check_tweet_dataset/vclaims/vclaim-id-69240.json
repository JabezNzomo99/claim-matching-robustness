The story is similar to an earlier article by Just News USA.\n\nWe found only speculative news reports about whether the Obamas would be invited and no official reports about the guest list. We found no credible news articles which stated that the Queen struck the Obamas from the list.\n\nThe fake story said that when Michelle Obama heard that Harry was marrying a black woman (Markle is biracial) she tried to \"sneak a spot on the guest list.\"\n\n\"Barack, who had been practically stalking Prince Harry on Twitter in recent weeks, made a post within seconds of the news coming out, which served the purpose of letting the Royals know that he and Michelle were angling for an invitation to the wedding of the year,\" the story said.\n\nEver since the couple announced their engagement in November, there have been multiple speculative news reports about who will and won\u2019t be invited to the wedding.\n\nSome news reports based on unnamed sources said that the couple want the Obamas at their May 19 wedding. While the royal family has been friendly with the Obamas, we found no official reports.\n\nThe royal family has put out two press releases regarding the engagement in November, and neither mention an invite list.\n\nOn Dec. 27, while guest-editing a BBC morning radio program, Harry joked that the guest list was still a ways off.\n\n\"I don't know about that -- we haven't even put the invite or the guest list together yet. Who knows if (Obama's) going to be invited or not,\" Harry said. \"I wouldn't want to ruin that surprise.\"\n\nNews reports have speculated about whether Trump will be invited to the royal wedding although there is precedent for sitting U.S. presidents to not attend.\n\nWhile those reports are speculative, Markle was critical of Trump before her engagement. In May 2016 while on The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, Markle said Trump was \"divisive\" and \"misogynistic.\"\n\nA headline said that \"Queen Elizabeth removes Obamas from royal wedding guest list.\" We found no credible reports that the Queen took this action -- just speculation about whether the Obamas will be invited.
