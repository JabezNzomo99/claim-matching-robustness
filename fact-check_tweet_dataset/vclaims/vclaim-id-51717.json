Two men, claimed to be journalists, can be seen taking a video of the person instead of helping them. On August 9, Union Youth Affairs and Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju shared the video on his official Facebook page with the caption, \u201cThe death of the soul of journalism.\u201d\n\nThe video has also been shared by several social media users. The clip below has 6,000 likes and over 3,000 retweets. It was shared by Twitter user @MdBabul38258561.\n\nAnother Twitter user @007AliSohrab brought in a Muslim angle to the incident by tweeting with the hashtag #BakraLivesMatter. The clip is massively viral on Facebook with the text, \u201c\u0938\u0921\u093c\u0915 \u092a\u0930 \u0924\u0921\u093c\u092a \u0930\u0939\u0940 \u0932\u0921\u093c\u0915\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u0928 \u0909\u0920\u093e\u0915\u0930 \u092a\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0905\u092a\u0928\u093e \u0935\u0940\u0921\u093f\u092f\u094b \u092c\u0928\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0932\u0917\u093e \u0939\u0948.\u201d\n\nAlt News found that the video was earlier shared by Nepali pages and handles. Nepal-based news outlet Nepal Khabar had shared the clip on August 2.\n\nA Facebook page \u2018Wake up Nepal\u2019 had shared it on August 3.\n\nBoth the pages have also highlighted the callousness of journalists.\n\nAlt News contacted Deepak Adhikari, editor of Nepal-based fact-checking outlet South Asia Check, who confirmed that people in the video can be heard conversing in Nepali. Adhikari also spoke with SSP Kuber Kadayat, Nepal (Central) Police Spokesperson. \u201cHe said that the clip represents a video shooting in Anamnagar area of Kathmandu. Someone took the video of the shooting from a house adjacent to the road,\u201d Adhikari quoted the police officer.\n\nIf one notices carefully, a cameraperson can be seen on the right of the fallen scooter in the first few seconds of the video. He gestures the two actors to cross the road. There are several other hints which suggest that the video is staged. The victim does not seem to be in a shape bad enough to not be able to get up. None of the passers-by come to their aid.\n\nA staged video from Nepal is, therefore, circulating in India as insensitive journalists trying to record an accident on camera instead of helping the person who has fallen from his bike. It is noteworthy that Nepal Khabar and other Nepal-based users have also shared the clip as a genuine video when it has been performed by actors.", "lang": "en"}
