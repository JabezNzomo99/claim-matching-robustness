He alleged that bricks were thrown at the rally from inside the campus and TMCP members set ablaze motorcycles and vandalised Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar\u2019s statue. The purported student claimed that BJP workers could not have desecrated the statue as it\u2019s located deep inside the campus. \u201cYou need to cross two gates \u2013 one iron and another wooden door \u2013 to reach the statue located completely inside the college premises. And TMCP was already inside the campus with bricks,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe Facebook post was earlier tweeted by MP Swapan Dasgupta and right-wing influencer Vikas Pandey.\n\nIncidentally, Biraj Narayan Roy\u2019s Facebook account is no longer available. However, the same message has been shared by numerous people, with some circulating it in the first person. This was pointed out by many Facebook users.\n\nThe circulation of the identical message was also noticed by Twitter users. One of them sarcastically wrote, \u201cToday, entire Facebook is \u2018I am a Vidyasagar student\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn this article, Alt News attempts to fact-check the claims made in the Facebook post.\n\nCLAIM 1: First brick was thrown from inside the college campus\n\nVisual evidence of who began the stone-pelting is yet to come up. However, a news broadcast by local Bengali channel Arambagh TV shows that bricks were thrown from both sides.\n\nAnother local news organisation Anandabazar ran a video during its broadcast that shows stone-pelting. As evident, stones are being hurled at the college by people standing outside on the road, wearing saffron coloured \u2018NaMo Again\u2019 t-shirts. Some retaliation can also be seen from inside the premises.\n\nThe Facebook post also claimed that TMCP members set ablaze motorcycles. But video footage from the ground shows men in saffron t-shirts setting the bikes on fire. This takes place outside the campus, as evident from the clip.\n\nAnother video shot from an elevated position shows the moment when the arson takes place. This footage gives a panoramic view of the site of violence. The bikes are burnt right outside the college gate that is surrounded by BJP supporters. They can be seen sporting saffron t-shirts and waving the party flag.\n\nCLAIM 3: BJP workers could not have entered the campus because it was locked\n\nThis claim was also made by Amit Shah during his press conference. Holding up a photograph of the glass enclosure where the statue was kept, he said, \u201cThis was inside two locked rooms. It wasn\u2019t publically displayed. My only question is that the incident happened at 7:30 when the college was shut and all the gates were locked. Who opened the rooms? Who had the keys? Who has an administrative hold over the college? It\u2019s TMC\u2026Bengal\u2019s citizens\u2019 should also know who gave the keys when the statue was inside a room? The lock was also not broken\u2026How can BJP workers have the key when they were on the road? All evidence points that Vidyasagar\u2019s statue was vandalised by TMC goons.\u201d\n\nMultiple videos available online show BJP supporters using force to get inside the college campus. At 0:19 minutes in the clip posted below, men adorning \u2018NaMo Again\u2019 t-shirts can be seen attempting to break the lock on the gate using sticks, striking the lock repeatedly.\n\nAnother video shows BJP supporters entering the campus after forcefully breaking the lock.\n\nAn aerial view of the violence showcases dozens of BJP workers/supporters gathered in front of the college gate. Many of them are attacking the locked gate and subsequently entering the campus. At about 50 seconds, the man recording the video can be heard saying in Bengali, \u201cThey are entering and breaking things.\u201d\n\nAmit Shah\u2019s rationale that his party workers couldn\u2019t have gotten access to the campus because they didn\u2019t have \u2018keys\u2019 is not supported by visual evidence that shows them striking the lock repeatedly and eventually breaking it to get inside the campus.\n\nCLAIM 4: BJP workers could not have vandalised Vidyasagar\u2019s statue as it is located deep inside the campus, guarded by an iron gate and a wooden door\n\nAlt News spoke to alumni of Vidyasagar college who said that the institution has multiple statues of Vidyasagar. The one vandalised in the violence was located close to the main building\u2019s gate.\n\nIt is true that one has to pass an iron gate, which is the main gate, and a wooden door to get to the statue. However, there is barely any distance between the access points. The image below shows the frontal view of the area where the violence took place. As evident, the main gate is iron, behind which are multiple wooden doors.\n\nWe have already shown while fact-checking \u2018Claim 4\u2019 that BJP workers entered the premises by repeatedly thrashing the gate and thus, breaking the lock. The party\u2019s chief and the viral social media post tried to build a narrative around the iron gate, attempting to propagate that it is indestructible. A gate, iron or wooden, is as strong as its lock. The misleading emphasis on the durability of the \u2018iron gate\u2019 is aimed at misleading people.\n\nAmit Shah alleged in his press conference that BJP workers could not have desecrated the statue as it was inside a locked room. The video posted below shows moments after the college gate was breached. Several individuals can be seen charging at wooden doors behind the iron gate.A few persons who have successfully opened the doors, enter the room and bring with them what looks like parts of a white coloured sculpture. At 0:13, we can see a white object, seemingly made of plaster of Paris, being brought out and thrown around. At 0:21, the same white object is hurled to the ground. From 0:28-0:41, the object remains untouched. At 0:42, a person picks it up and thrashes it again. At least two men in the video can be seen wearing BJP\u2019s colour.\n\nWe also located a clip that covers the entire set of events. Posted below, the video first shows saffron-clad men charging at the main gate and going past it at 00:32. At about 3:00 minutes into the video, the person recording the footage can be heard saying, \u201cThey\u2019ve broken the door and entered inside\u201d while referring to the wooden door of the building inside. At 4:00, the mob can be seen bringing out Vidyasagar\u2019s bust and thrashing it on the ground. From 7:33 onward, motorcycles are set ablaze.\n\nPhotographs published by The Telegraph show ruins of Vidyasagar\u2019s bust that was kept inside a glass enclosure \u2013 the same enclosure that was broadcast by Amit Shah during his press conference.\n\nAccording to The Telegraph, \u201cPrincipal Goutam Kundu, who said he was shocked while speaking minutes after the attack between 6.50pm and 7.05pm on Tuesday, described how a group broke open the gate and stormed the office and went for the glass case.\u201d\n\nA video posted by Amit Malviya shows moments after Vidyasagar\u2019s bust was vandalised when CM Mamata Banerjee inspects the site. It\u2019s noteworthy that the second part of Malviya\u2019s tweet \u2013 \u201cthe broken statue was neatly placed for Mamata Banerjee\u201d \u2013 is misleading because we have already substantiated from earlier videos that the statue was placed inside a glass enclosure, which was broken by force and the statue was hurled right outside the wooden doors. The clip posted by BJP IT cell head depicts the same location where the statue was destroyed.\n\nAs per multiple video footages, the ones charging at the locked gates wore saffron t-shirts and the ones forcefully entering the campus were also similarly dressed. That the TMCP vandalised Vidyasagar\u2019s statue is a claim not backed by any visual evidence.\n\nIn conclusion, Amit Shah\u2019s allegations and the claims raised in the viral social media post, that were shared by Amit Malviya and Swapan Dasgupta, are not supported by visuals from the ground.\n\n[UPDATE 1: A video showcasing all the events \u2013 saffron-clad men breaking open the iron gate, entering the room with the wooden door, bringing out Vidyasagar\u2019s bust, thrashing it on the ground and setting motorcycles on fire \u2013 has been included under \u2018CLAIM 4\u2019.\n\nUPDATE 2: \u2018CLAIM 1\u2019 has been updated with video footage that showcases stone-pelting from both sides.]", "lang": "en"}
