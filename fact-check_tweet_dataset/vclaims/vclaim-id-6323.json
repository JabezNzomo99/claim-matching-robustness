It \u201cprovides for both same-sex and opposite-sex unions\u201d,\n\ndirector of health and vital statistics at\n\n, told Africa Check. \u201cSpouses are identifiable as spouse 1 and spouse 2 only.\u201d\n\nUnder the act, civil unions enjoy the same legal recognition that is afforded to civil as well as customary marriages.\n\nStats SA reports on civil unions as part of its annual\n\n. The latest one is for 2015 and contains data collected from the department of home affairs\u2019 registration system.\n\nThe number of civil unions increased slightly between 2014 and 2015, from 1,144 to 1,185. Gauteng and the Western Cape had the highest number of civil unions registered with 443 and 346 respectively.\n\nAs the sex of the spouses involved is not captured, the figures are based on all unions, whether of the same or opposite sex,\n\nsaid. The race or home language of civil partners are also not collected, the department of home affairs\u2019 Ashwin Ramsunder told Africa Check.\n\nIt\u2019s therefore impossible to verify the claim that 80% of same-sex couples who got married were Afrikaans-speaking, Ramsunder, who is from the department\u2019s directorate for marriages, said.\n\nManager of research, advocacy and policy at human rights organisation\n\n, Matthew Clayton, told Africa Check that he has \u201cnot seen any breakdown of people who enter into same-sex marriages\u201d.\n\n\u201cI know there has been some [r\n\nesearch conducted into same-sex marriages in South Africa], but most of what I can recall is about the legal change allowing it to happen and regarding its implementation,\u201d Clayton said.\n\nA recent tweet by the Afrikaans version page of the Wikipedia claimed that roughly\n\n80% of same-sex marriages in South Africa are entered into by Afrikaans speakers.\n\nA closer look at the source of the claim revealed that the statement was an anecdote of one religious minister\u2019s experience, seven years ago.\n\nNeither Statistics SA nor the department of home affairs keeps record of the race or home languages of couples entering into civil unions in South Africa. Therefore there is no way to verify this claim, the department said.", "lang": "en"}
