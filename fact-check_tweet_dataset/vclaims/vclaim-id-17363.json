Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: The photographer in the picture cried after M.S. Dhoni\u2019s wicket. Fact: The photographer in the picture is an Iraqi photographer, who cried after his country\u2019s exit from the AFC Asian Cup \u2013 2019. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the picture of the photographer is cropped from the posted photo and is run through the Google Reverse Image Search, the photo was found to be posted back in January-2019 by multiple internet users and websites. The same photo was tweeted by a TV correspondent with a description that the man in the picture is Mohammed AL Azzawi, who was in tears after his country (Iraq) lost to Qatar in AFC Asian Cup-2019, related to Soccer. Also, another picture of the photographer can be found in the tweet.\n\nTo sum it up, the Iraqi photographer cried when his country lost to Qatar, not when Dhoni lost his wicket.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
