No, that's not true: An earlier version of the poem attributed to \"unknown\" appeared in a Facebook post on June 7, 2020, but it did not include any mention of \"defund the police.\" A more recent version purportedly shared by the actor does address \"defund the police.\" There is no evidence Russell shared or wrote this poem.\n\nThe claim appeared in a post (archived here) where it was published on Facebook on August 9, 2020. The post began with the words \"Amazing Post!\" followed by this introduction to the poem attributed to Russell:\n\nYes... let's all join in the hatred of all police for the sins of a few. Let's defund one of the most important public institutions in our countries history. Let's have all badges removed and allow people to tend to their own safety and security. But before you do so, Let me tell you about the badge and the thousands of good men and women it represents.\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\n\"The Badge\" poem followed the introduction falsely attributed to Russell:\n\nThis badge ran towards certain death as the Towers collapsed on 9-11. This badge ran into the line of fire to save the people in the Pulse Night Club. This badge sheltered thousands as bullets rained down from the Mandalay Hotel in Las Vegas. This badge protected a BLM rally that left five officers dead in Dallas. This badge ran into the Sandy Hook School to stop a school shooter. This badge killed the Oregon District mass shooter in seconds.\n\nThis badge has done CPR on your drowned child. This badge has fist fought the wife beater who left his spouse in a coma. This badge has run into burning buildings to save the occupants.\n\nThis badge has been shot for simply existing.\n\nThis badge has waded through flood waters to rescue the elderly trapped on the roof. This badge has intentionally crashed into the wrong way driver to protect innocent motorists. This badge has helped find the lost child so his mother would stop crying hysterically.\n\nThis badge has helped the injured dog off the road and rushed it to the vet. This badge has escorted the elderly woman across the street because she couldn't see well and was afraid to cross. This badge has bought food for hungry kids because they had been abandoned.\n\nThis badge has been soaked in blood and tears. This badge has been covered by a mourning band to honor those who have sacrificed everything in service.\n\nYou may hate me because I wear it. But, I wear it with pride. Despite your hate and your anger, I will await the next call for help. And, I will come running without hesitation. Just like the thousands of men and women across this great nation.\n\nThis badge.\n\nAn conclusion falsely attributed to Russell followed:\n\nThere is no evidence Russell shared either version of this poem.\n\nThe earlier version as it appeared in a Facebook post:\n\nRussell has been the target of false claims before, and Lead Stories has debunked some of these bogus claims in the past:\n\nFact Check: Photo Does NOT Show Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn Wearing Trump Apparel\n\nFake News: Kurt Russell Did NOT Claim Democrats Want To Abolish 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th Amendments, Senate, Electoral College, Supreme Court, Borders and ICE\n\nPolitiFact and Snopes also conducted fact-checks on this claim about the poem attributed to Russell.", "lang": "en"}
