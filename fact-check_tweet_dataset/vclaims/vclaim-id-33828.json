{"title": "Fact-Checkers Raise Concerns Over How Facebook Defines Politicians", "subtitle": "Facebook came up with a crucial definition for fact-checkers and quietly edited its website. Now, in a few sentences, the company makes clear what a politician is and reiterates its policy that they can\u2019t be fact-checked.", "author": "www.thequint.com", "date": "2019-11-18T13:23:51+05:30", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-33828", "url": "https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/what-fact-checkers-think-about-facebook-politician-definition", "vclaim": "In one way it will help fact-checkers because it defines scope, and is something to point to when they are asked why their fact checks of politicians\u2019 statements or ads are not showing up on Facebook. The company came up with the definition, in fact, because fact-checkers said they wanted more clarity.\n\nBut some fact-checkers, especially those operating outside the United States, say the definition of a politician in office or running for office carries some potentially unintended consequences.\n\nFor example, not every country has campaigns that take as long as those in the United States. That means office-holders in some places would have a longer window of not being fact-checked than their challengers. And that could provide an advantage to those incumbents.\n\nSome fact-checkers also saw the definition as election-centric. What about politicians who spread misinformation about issues that are not related to their political campaigns and not just during an election? Think about a mayor posting hoaxes about vaccines.", "lang": "en"}
