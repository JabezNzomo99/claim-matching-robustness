Hundreds liked and shared the purported \u201cfuneral image,\u201d sourced to \u201cJNN News.\u201d Several posts claimed the image was proof that he had died.\n\nReports about Kim\u2019s possible critical condition after a surgery and speculations about his death have been circulating in both mainstream and social media since mid-April. With Pyongyang mostly silent, experts and politicians worldwide engaged in a guessing game: some assuring Kim was either ill or dead, others claiming the opposite.\n\nSpeculation went into a frenzy after Hong Kong Satellite Television News reported that Kim Jong-un died early Saturday morning, April 25. The hashtag \u201cKIMJONGUNDEAD\u201d trended No. 1 in the United States that day.\n\nTwitter user @kingwithin, posted a photograph taken of the image on a flatscreen, as if it were taken during a \u201cJNN News\u201d broadcast. The post captioned \u201cKim Jong Un is dead! \u2013 pic\u201d received 358 likes and 97 retweets.\n\nAnother post by user @LucasRHill also tweeted this image-of-an-image. It received 1,900 likes and 458 shares. Despite sharing, he cautioned against trusting that the image was real.\n\nOther posts claimed the image is real.\n\nThe image contains text in Japanese and attributed to \u201cJNN News.\u201d In English, this translates to: \u201cBreaking News North Korea: Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un is Dead.\u201d\n\nThe image appears to be a doctored version of a photograph of the late Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Un\u2019s father and North Korea\u2019s former supreme leader, who died in 2011.\n\nIn addition, while JNN is a commercial television news network in Japan, it functions as a program supplier to its network stations. There is no known \u201cJNN News\u201d show.\n\nAs of this writing, speculation about Kim Jong Un\u2019s health and whereabouts continue. It began when he failed to appear at state ceremonies for the national holiday named for his late grandfather, Kim Il Sung. The \u201cDay of the Sun\u201d is celebrated on April 15.", "lang": "en"}
