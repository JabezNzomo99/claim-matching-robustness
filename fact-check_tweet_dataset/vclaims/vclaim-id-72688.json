The image is a doctored photo of drivers objecting to regulations on ride-hailing services which has no link to the election.\n\nThe picture, which has been shared 600 times since it was uploaded to Facebook on January 21, shows what appears to be motorcycle taxi drivers signing a white banner with text that reads: \u201cPrabowo Presiden\u201d (Prabowo for president).\n\nThere is a watermark of Tribunnews.com -- an online media outlet in Indonesia \u2013 at the bottom right of the image.\n\nBelow that is text that reads in English: \u201cWe, Grab and Go-Jek Indonesia, fully support Prabowo and Sandi in Indonesia\u2019s presidential election. Ten million signatures supporting #02.\u201d\n\nGrab and Go-Jek are Indonesia\u2019s two biggest ride-hailing services, while \u201c#02\u201d refers to the ballot number of Subianto and his vice-presidential running mate Sandiaga Uno. The pair are challenging incumbent leader Joko Widodo and his running mate Ma\u2019ruf Amin in April 2019 elections.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption translates as: \u201cOnline motorcycle taxis show they care about the nation by pledging full support for Prabowo-Sandi pair.\u201d\n\nA reverse image search shows the picture has been doctored.
