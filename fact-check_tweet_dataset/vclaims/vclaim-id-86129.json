Interestingly, Cruz appeared to try to make his point fact-check proof; he had earlier earned a \u201cfalse\u201d from PolitiFact Texas for saying that the resolution was to legalize all narcotics, rather than just to debate the issue.\n\nIn another report in the records, filed with the Texas Department of Public Safety, Carrera wrote that the \u201cdefendant was unable to be understood due to slurred speech\u201d and that he had \u201cglossy eyes\u201d and \u201cbreath that smelled of an alcohol beverage.\u201d When Carrera asked O\u2019Rourke to step out of the vehicle, he \u201calmost fell to the floor\u201d and was repeatedly unable to complete a test of standing on one leg. He \u201cfailed by totally losing his balance.\u201d\n\nWhen O\u2019Rourke blew into a breathalyzer, the results were a blood alcohol content of 0.136 and 0.134. The legal state limit in Texas at the time was 0.10; a year later, it was lowered to 0.08. With a blood alcohol level of between 0.130 and 0.159, a person experiences \u201cgross motor impairment and lack of physical control. Blurred vision and major loss of balance. Euphoria is reducing and beginning dysphoria (a state of feeling unwell).\u201d For a male of 190 pounds, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s weight as listed in the police report, that blood alcohol concentration is reached after six drinks.\n\nThere are some inconsistencies in the police records \u2014 O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Volvo is described as both black and green, and he\u2019s traveling either west or east \u2014 but the witness to the crash is twice described as saying O\u2019Rourke tried to leave the scene of the crash. The witness is not identified. We could not locate Carrera, who no longer works for the Anthony Police Department, for further comment. (See update below.)\n\nUpdate: Several readers objected to this fact check, saying we could not rely on police reports because they often have incomplete and contradictory information. Readers noted that O\u2019Rourke was not charged with leaving the scene, other possible witnesses were not interviewed and the police officer did not personally observe O\u2019Rourke trying to flee. Some readers suggested that O\u2019Rourke was simply trying to move his car.\n\nUpdate, Oct. 1: In an interview with Texas Tribune chief executive Evan Smith on Sept. 29, O\u2019Rourke said \u201cthe police report on this count is wrong.\" O\u2019Rourke added: \u201cI reached out to the passenger who was in the car that I was driving \u2014 who also does not appear in the police report, among other factual errors \u2014 somebody that I\u2019ve not spoken to in more than 15 years, and asked her recollection of that evening. She said, \u2018No, we were in the median of the road. We did not try to flee. I don\u2019t know that there was anywhere we could have gone.\u2019\u201d O\u2019Rourke has not identified the passenger.\n\nUpdate, April 24, 2019: The Texas Tribune located Carrera, the police officer who arrested O\u2019Rourke, and the police sergeant who signed the incident report. \u201cBoth say they believe now what they reported at the time: that O\u2019Rourke tried to leave the scene of the wreck he caused,\u201d the Tribune reported. \u201cNeither the investigating officer, Richard Carrera, nor his former supervisor, Gary Hargrove, specifically recalls the events of that night more than 20 years ago. But both of the former Anthony Police Department officers told The Texas Tribune they have no doubt the report they compiled and signed is accurate.\u201d\n\nThe Tribune added: \u201cOne thing that could potentially help clarify matters is the accident report that Hargrove says he would have compiled and, as rules at the time required, copied and forwarded to the Texas Department of Public Safety. That report, separate from the DWI arrest report, would typically have a sketch of the crash scene and should contain the witness name and affidavit, Hargrove said. But current Anthony Police Chief Carlos Enriquez said a thorough search of department files turned up only the DWI report and accompanying breathalyzer analysis.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke was so drunk that he could barely get out of the car without falling, so perhaps he would not have gotten far \u2014 or he was simply confused. Perhaps in his memory, O\u2019Rourke believes he did not try to leave. But, given his blood alcohol content at the time of the crash, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s memory 20 years after the fact is not nearly as credible as the police reports written just hours after the crash. Even if one is inclined to dismiss police reports as riddled with errors, it is the one contemporary record we have.", "lang": "en"}
