The image is real, depicting an eroded municipal steel pipe \u2014 but it was taken in Thailand.\n\nSeveral posts in French, including ones which we\u2019ve archived here and here, have claimed in recent months that the pipe was photographed in Cameroon.\n\n\u201cYou can see what the water (President) Paul Biya and his wife are making you drink passes through,\u201d said one post which was shared nearly 400 times back in June.\n\nWhen we fact-checked the image in French earlier this year, we found that the photo was in fact taken in Bangkok, as seen in a 2017 Facebook post by the Metropolitan Waterworks Authority (MWA), Thailand's public drinking water company.\n\nThe Thai-language post says that the water pipeline has not been in use since April 2016, when it was removed from Lat Krabang, an eastern suburb of Bangkok. It added that the yellowish substance inside the pipeline was created over time due to particles found in water.\n\nMWA said the water passing through the pipe was of good quality as the deposit doesn\u2019t mix with water.\n\nMore recently, the same photo was posted in English by a water purification company based in Cape Town, South Africa, on October 29.\n\nThe caption is rather confusing and appears to have been updated after the owners of the page realised that the photo was old.\n\nHowever, even the updated version could leave some readers with the impression that the pipe was photographed in South Africa.\n\n\u201cPost edit: This is an old internet photo of galvanised mild steel, that has rusted due to corrosion and legit what our water runs through if piping is not cleaned. We have now attached a picture of a clients municipal water in Grabouw before and after treatment. A glimpse of the water pipes that transport your municipal drinking water\u2026..#waterislife,\u201d reads the caption.\n\nSome Facebook users had expressed shock at the photograph, while others accused the company of using a misleading image to try to garner business.\n\nThe confusing reference to \u201ca picture of a clients municipal water in Grabouw before and after treatment\u201d \u2014 which does not actually appear in the post \u2014 is perhaps explained by a second, separate post on the Facebook page, which again shows the pipe picture alongside another image of two glasses of water.", "lang": "en"}
