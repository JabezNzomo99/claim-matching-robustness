It does not appear in University College London\u2019s archive of his writings.\n\n\u201cSimilar sentiments perhaps, but different language,\u201d said Dorian Lynskey, author of \u201cThe Ministry of Truth: The Biography of George Orwell\u2019s 1984,\u201d in an email to the DCNF. \u201cThere is no evidence of Orwell writing the quoted sentence.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Orwell did make thematically similar statements. He wrote an essay in 1942 about writer Rudyard Kipling in which he stated, \u201c[Kipling] sees clearly that men can only be highly civilized while other men, inevitably less civilized, are there to guard and feed them.\u201d\n\nIn another essay, Orwell included a line with a similar sentiment while discussing pacifists: \u201cThose who \u2018abjure\u2019 violence can only do so because others are committing violence on their behalf.\u201d\n\nThe website Quote Investigator traced the quote to columnist Richard Grenier\u2019s 1993 article in The Washington Times, where he wrote, \u201cAs George Orwell pointed out, people sleep peacefully in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf.\u201d\n\nSome readers likely mistook Grenier\u2019s attempt at summarizing Orwell\u2019s viewpoint for a direct quotation, even though Grenier\u2019s sentence did not enclose the expression in quotation marks.\n\n\u201cThis is a known mechanism for the generation of misattributions,\u201d explained Quote Investigator. \u201cPerson A summarizes, condenses, or restates the opinion of Person B. At a later time the restatement is directly ascribed to Person B.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
