Will we really do free trade deals? And can we really go on with a negotiating team that has so resoundingly failed? If she cannot give that evidence of change\u2014she should drop the deal, and go back to Brussels, and simply set out the terms that so many on both sides\u2014remainers and leavers\u2014 now believe are sensible. \u201cExtend the implementation period to the end of 2021 if necessary; use it to negotiate a free trade deal; pay the fee; but come out of the EU now\u2014without the backstop. It is time for the PM to channel the spirit of Moses in Exodus, and say to Pharaoh in Brussels\u2014LET MY PEOPLE GO.\u201d\n\nThis set of suggestions from Boris Johnson\u2019s Telegraph column touches on an issue we have previously written about several times: the misleading idea that we can leave the EU with no Brexit deal and still enter a transition period.\n\nAlthough Mr Johnson doesn\u2019t explicitly call for no deal in the article, he calls on Theresa May to both \u201cdrop\u201d her Brexit deal and come out of the EU \u201cnow\u201d, but also to carry out an action\u2014in extending the implementation period to 2021\u2014that can only happen if a deal is passed.\n\nThe \u201cimplementation\u201d or \u201ctransition\u201d period is part of Theresa May\u2019s proposed withdrawal agreement with the EU. It\u2019s meant to kick in immediately after we leave the EU and run to the end of 2020 (although it can be extended by one or two years). In that time we would remain in the single market and the customs union\u2014and the period is designed to give us more time to negotiate a future trade deal with the EU.\n\nFor Theresa May to try and follow the full set of Mr Johnson\u2019s suggestions\u2014dropping her deal, leaving the EU imminently, with no Irish backstop, but also with an implementation period\u2014would require a remarkable turn of events. She would have to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, which the EU have said they will not do, asking for changes that the EU have repeatedly refused, in the space of a few days.\n\nWe know that the Irish backstop is a red line for the EU, so any deal would have to include it.\n\nAnd last week, the European Council agreed to extend the Brexit deadline to 22 May on the condition that Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement is passed this week. That means that, if the UK is to leave the EU imminently with a deal\u2014as Mr Johnson\u2019s suggestions imply\u2014it will have to be with the current withdrawal agreement.\n\nIf the withdrawal agreement is not approved by parliament, then the UK will have to \u201cindicate a way forward\u201d before 12 April. The possible outcomes in this case are a no deal Brexit, a long extension to the date that we leave the EU, or revoking Article 50 and not leaving at all.", "lang": "en"}
