One day they will restrict your freedoms, restrict your history and restrict your safety. All in the name of professional victims that don\u2019t understand the consequences of their ignorance.\u201d\n\nThis is not a genuine quote from Ronald Reagan.\n\nWe were unable to document this quote in any reputable source. Our searches on the websites for the National Archives, the Ronald Reagan Foundation, and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library & Museum all came up empty-handed. We also searched news articles from 1987 via Newspaper.com for this quote, but to no avail.\n\nMichael Pinckney, an archivist at the Reagan Library, confirmed that this quote does not appear in any of Reagan\u2019s official speeches:\n\nWhile we\u2019ve come across dozens of postings of this quote, none of these messages were accompanied by any links to an original source. The earliest posting of this quote that we could find was shared on July 14, 2020 \u2014 about 16 years after Reagan\u2019s death. That poster admitted that they had no evidence that Reagan actually said this phrase, but argued that it was \u201cnot really the point who said it,\u201d because the quote was \u201cspot on.\u201d\n\nOf course, the author of a quote is vitally important. It\u2019s one reason why purveyors of misinformation often falsely attach famous people \u2014 such as Ronald Reagan \u2014 to a political opinion. This gives the opinion an air of credibility, and helps the quote go viral. There\u2019s no evidence, however that Reagan actually made this statement.", "lang": "en"}
