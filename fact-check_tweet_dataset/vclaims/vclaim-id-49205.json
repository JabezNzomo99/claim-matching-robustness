But interestingly enough, none of the posts include a source to corroborate the claim.\n\nThis seems to be because there is no record of Trump ever making the statement. Several posts on social media specified that the statement allegedly came Tuesday, March 17, a day Trump held two events that were recorded and broadcasted: a White House task force briefing on the coronavirus outbreak and a meeting with tourism executives about the global pandemic\u2019s impact on the industry. The alleged statement was not found in the transcript of either event.\n\nThere is also no record of him tweeting it on his Twitter timeline or in ProPublica\u2019s archive of his deleted tweets. Other fact-checkers failed to find any evidence that Trump made the statement, and Snopes noted the saying is a \u201clong-standing internet joke.\u201d (RELATED: Can Inhaling Hot Air From A Sauna Or Hair Dryer Kill Coronavirus?)\n\nThe quote was attributed to former Alabama governor and segregationist George Wallace on Twitter back in 2008.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
