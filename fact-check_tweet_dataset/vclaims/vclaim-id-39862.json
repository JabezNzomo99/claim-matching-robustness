(RELATED: Did Thomas Jefferson Say, \u2018Eternal Vigilance is the Price of Liberty?\u2019)\n\nThe Daily Caller found no record of the expression in Jefferson\u2019s written works. A search of his estate at Monticello\u2019s collection of his letters and quotes also did not yield any results.\n\n\u201cWe have never been able to find any source that confirms that these are words written or spoken by Thomas Jefferson,\u201d confirmed Lisa Francavilla of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation in an email to the Caller. \u201cIt is therefore what we call \u2018spurious\u2019 or \u2018misattributed.'\u201d\n\nIn 2013, conservative writer Cal Thomas included the misattributed quote in a column for the Washington Examiner.", "lang": "en"}
