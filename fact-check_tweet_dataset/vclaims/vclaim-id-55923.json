The campaign referred us to Treasury, which did not respond to our inquiries. An IRS spokesperson said the agency would get back to us, but it didn\u2019t. We never heard back from the White House.\n\nThe total investment is difficult to ascertain; there is no complete public list of all such investments.\n\nThe firm Novogradac maintains a list of voluntarily disclosed opportunity zone investments. It reported on April 29 that the total had surpassed $10 billion, and the actual total was \u201clikely significantly more than that.\u201d The firm said almost all of the money was invested before March 13, when Trump declared a national emergency to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe Urban Institute, in a report issued in June, cited investment of \u201cat least $10 billion.\u201d\n\nJohn Lettieri, president and CEO of the Economic Innovation Group, which has long championed opportunity zones, laughed when we asked him about Trump\u2019s $100 billion figure. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure no one knows where that number comes from,\u201d he told us.\n\nHe estimates that the total is in the $25 billion to $30 billion range, which in his view is not bad for a relatively new program whose rules weren\u2019t finalized until late last year. \u201cIt\u2019s worth celebrating, but it\u2019s important not to be triumphalist,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is very much a work in progress.\u201d\n\nThe National Council of State Housing Agencies maintains an Opportunity Zone Fund Directory. As of June 1, it listed 213 funds with a total of $47.2 billion in anticipated total investment \u2013anticipated, not actual investment.\n\nSo where does Trump\u2019s $100 billion projection come from? Probably from the Treasury Department. Secretary Steve Mnuchin used the figure in the fall of 2018 in announcing proposed regulations for the program and in an interview with The Hill newspaper.\n\nBut that\u2019s $100 billion over the life of the program, which expires at the end of 2028.\n\nTrump, who has often touted opportunity zones to show how much he is doing for the Black community, has used the $100 billion figure before, but as a projection, not something already achieved.\n\nOpportunity zones were created under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law by Trump on Dec. 22, 2017. The zones, designed to bring development to largely low-income areas that otherwise would have trouble attracting it, had long been pushed by Sean Parker, the founding president of Facebook and the co-founder of the music file-sharing service Napster. The zones were enthusiastically backed by Sens. Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina, and Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey. Their legislation was folded into the tax cut bill.\n\nHere\u2019s how the zones work: In the summer of 2018, the Treasury Department earmarked 8,766 census tracts nominated by governors and the mayor of the District of Columbia as opportunity zones. Combined, the areas have a poverty rate nearly twice the national average.\n\nThose who invest in projects in those zones get a double-barreled tax break. First, the law permits investors to defer capital gains taxes for up to seven years on money they invest there. Second, if the investors hold onto the opportunity zone investment for 10 years, they don\u2019t have to pay any capital gains taxes on that investment.\n\nWhile it is admittedly early in the process, the Urban Institute took a look to see how things are going so far. It found some upsides but also some problems. The report said the research \u201cincluded about 70 in-depth interviews with project sponsors; fund managers; investors; wealth managers; developers; philanthropies; and public and nonprofit agencies working with OZs, such as community development intermediaries, state OZ program offices, and city-level OZ coordinators.\u201d\n\nOn the upside, the report said, the zones \u201care helping spur the evolution of a new community development ecosystem, engaging both project developers and investors who have limited historical engagement in community development work.\u201d\n\nBut it also found that it was easier to find investors for high-profit developments than for enterprises that would help the community.\n\n\u201cAs OZ incentives are not structured to encourage resident or community engagement, mission-oriented projects struggle to compete for attention with higher-return projects\u2013for which OZs provide much larger subsidies because of the design of the incentive,\u201d the report said.\n\nIt added, \u201cAlthough OZs were designed to spur job creation, the vast majority of OZ capital appears to be flowing into real estate, not into operating businesses.\u201d That\u2019s contrary to Trump\u2019s claim that the program has created \u201ccountless jobs.\u201d\n\nBut on a brighter note, the Urban Institute report said many observers found the program \u201celevates the visibility of neighborhoods and deals that investors might not have considered otherwise.\u201d\n\nA New York Times investigation of the program last November found \u201cthe Trump administration\u2019s signature plan to lift [cities] \u2014 a multibillion-dollar tax break that is supposed to help low-income areas \u2014 has fueled a wave of developments financed by and built for the wealthiest Americans.\u201d The article spotlighted luxury developments backed by big celebrity developers and help for projects already in the works.\n\nBut the article also cited projects helping the intended targets, like one in Birmingham, Alabama, in which a long-vacant building was being recast as apartments for local residents.\n\nLettieri sees signs of hope in places like struggling Erie, Pennsylvania, where he says officials are using the tool in conjunction with local development strategies. He declares himself \u201ccautiously optimistic.\u201d\n\nSo, it\u2019s way too early to determine the success of the program, and the pandemic has put things on hold. But one thing is clear: Trump has produced no evidence that $100 billion has been invested in opportunity zones and no support for his claim that it has created \u201ccountless jobs.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
