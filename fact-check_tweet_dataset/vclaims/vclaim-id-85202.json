Scott Walker, who plans to seek the GOP presidential nomination, caught some flak recently when he described ultrasound photographs of fetuses as a \u201ccool thing out there.\u201d He made that remark as part of a defense of signing a 2013 law that requires women considering an abortion to receive an ultrasound before undergoing the procedure. (We won\u2019t get into the debate, but anti-abortion advocates argue that an ultrasound might convince a woman not to have an abortion\u2014a theory disputed by others.)\n\nIn a recent New Hampshire appearance, Walker was challenged by a voter who asked why he thought it was cool to have a transvaginal ultrasound. He responded that the state law had been misconstrued in the media\u2014\u201cread the statute\u201d\u2014and instead women had a choice of the type of ultrasound they received. He made a similar comment on Fox News.\n\nWisconsin is one of 23 states that regulate the use of ultrasound by abortion providers, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights. An ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to create a sonogram of the fetus and the placenta. That sonogram looks like a photograph and has become a rite of passage for many expectant mothers.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that most abortions occur within the first trimester of a pregnancy. In Wisconsin in 2013, according to a state report, 84 percent of abortions occurred at or before 12 weeks from a woman\u2019s last menstrual period. So for women early in their pregnancy, a transvaginal ultrasound would be the best option to obtain a clear image and heartbeat.\n\nBelow are the relevant sections of the law signed by Walker. The ultrasound is required before an abortion except in medical emergencies or in a case of sexual assault. The key issue concerns the interaction of these sections. The Walker campaign pointed to sections #1 and #5 to demonstrate that the transvaginal ultrasound is not mandatory:\n\n#1: Perform an obstetric ultrasound on the pregnant woman using whichever transducer the woman chooses after the options have been explained to her. A facility that offers ultrasounds at no cost to satisfy the requirements of this subsection shall have available transducers to perform both transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasounds. #5: Provide a means for the pregnant woman to visualize any fetal heartbeat, if a heartbeat is detectable by the ultrasound transducer type chosen by the woman under subd. 1., and provide to the pregnant woman, in a manner understandable to a layperson, a simultaneous oral explanation.\n\nSection 1 clearly says that the woman has a choice of procedures. Section 5, meanwhile, has a crucial word \u201cif\u201d\u2013the woman is shown the heartbeat \u201cif a heartbeat is detectable by the ultrasound transducer type chosen by the woman.\u201d That language, the Walker campaign says, demonstrates that if the woman chooses an option that does not detect a heartbeat, the law\u2019s requirements are still fulfilled.\n\nOne legal theory is that because there is no \u201cif\u201d in this section, it puts the burden on the clinician to describe the visual images on the ultrasound screen and provide the dimensions of the fetus. If there are no usable images, then the abortion provider could be in violation of the law, a representative of an abortion provider said. (She declined to be identified because a legal challenge is still being considered. Thus far, no lawsuit has been filed over this provision of the law.)\n\nBut Heather Weininger, executive director of Wisconsin Right to Life, disputes that theory. \u201cIt is the women\u2019s decision to choose what method she wants,\u201d she said. \u201cThe doctor would fully explain what could be measured and what could be seen\u201d before the ultrasound, but then the woman could still choose a transabdominal method, even if she was told the procedure would not result in distinct images.\n\nWendie Ashlock, director of Affiliated Medical Services, an abortion clinic, in 2013 wrote in The Huffington Post that her clinic has always required ultrasounds. \u201cIf you go to an abortion clinic that doesn\u2019t insist on an ultrasound, you should walk out the door. It\u2019s just bad medicine,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the most accurate way to date the pregnancy and determine which type of procedure is most appropriate.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The Fact Checker, Ashlock said the main result of the ultrasound language in the 2013 law is that the clinic must now read a \u201cstate-mandated script\u201d about the ultrasound and images and sounds that will be produced under the two options. She added that the clinic had previously provided this information, but now it was required to use the language written by the state.\n\nWalker appears to be on solid ground with his description of the ultrasound options available to women under the law. Despite the legal theory by one abortion provider about section 4, it does not appear to have much effect in practice. No matter the stage of the pregnancy, women in Wisconsin appear to have a choice of either ultrasound technique needed to fulfill the law\u2019s requirements.", "lang": "en"}
