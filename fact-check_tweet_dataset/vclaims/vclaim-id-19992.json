I bring a broader representation to the board.\"\n\nMuseitif went on: \"Austin has a growing Muslim, Arab, and refugee community and they need a voice at the table. I can be that voice. I'm a Muslim and speak fluent Arabic, which is the third most-common language in Austin.\"\n\nThat\u2019s not so for all of Austin, we found, but it has been so among patients seeking care at clinics overseen by Central Health.\n\nFor all of Texas, we previously found True a 2016 claim by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, that Vietnamese is the state\u2019s third most-spoken language. Cornyn\u2019s statement was backed up by U.S. Census Bureau survey results. Those results placed Arabic about No. 10 in the state.\n\nTed Burton, a Central Health spokesman, responded to our request for the basis of Museitif\u2019s statement by saying she meant to say something less. \"Museitif,\" Burton wrote, \"was referring to CommUnityCare\u2019s patient population \u2013 meaning patients in our community that Central Health serves.\" He said the online press release quoting Museitif would be amended to quote her calling Arabic \"the third most common language in the CommUnityCare patient population.\"\n\nCentral Health says it works through a network of health care partners and community members to connect uninsured, underinsured and low-income residents with high-quality, cost-effective health care. Its all-volunteer board consists of four members appointed by the council, four by the Travis County Commissioners Court \u2014 plus one joint appointee\n\nBurton wrote that in fiscal 2015, a little over half of the entity\u2019s patients spoke English, nearly 44 percent spoke Spanish--and, third in concentration, 1.1 percent reported speaking Arabic, according to self-reported patient data. In the year, Burton said, about 20 clinics served more than 88,000 patients.\n\nBurton, asked for more detail, emailed us a document showing that Arabic also proved to be CommUnityCare patients\u2019 third most-common language in 2014 and 2016. Asked why Arabic has been so widely used among patients, Burton put us in touch with an Arabic-speaking CommUnityCare physician assistant, Amneh Amro, who speculated by phone that there\u2019d been an Austin-area uptick in refugees from Arabic-speaking countries including Syria. A decade earlier, Amro said, Asian languages were likely more prevalent among patients. When we asked, Burton said Central Health has no data on patients' countries of origin. So, which languages are most prevalent in Austin? We heard back from a couple of authorities on that. Jewel Jordan, a Census Bureau spokeswoman, pointed out results from the single-year 2015 American Community Survey indicating that behind English and Spanish, the third most common spoken language in Austin was Chinese. According to those survey results, Arabic was Austin\u2019s 12th most-common spoken language \u2014 though we noticed that if you apply the survey\u2019s margin of error figures as much as possible to drive up the number of Austin Arabic speakers and apply respective margins of error to drive down the number of speakers of some other languages, it\u2019s possible to place Arabic fifth in the city, behind English, Spanish, Chinese and \"Other Asian Languages.\" Ryan Robinson, the City of Austin demographer, drew on the bureau\u2019s five-year ACS results through 2015 to provide a chart showing Arabic 10th in prevalence among spoken languages in Austin behind English, Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, other Asian languages, Korean, Hindi, French and other Indic languages. The chart also presents estimates of the number of individuals primarily speaking about 30 other languages. That\u2019s incorrect; in 2015, Chinese ranked third in prevalence in Austin behind English and Spanish, according to federal surveys. Arabic was evidently third most common among languages spoken by patients at clinics overseen by Central Health.\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.
