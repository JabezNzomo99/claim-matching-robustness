The earliest version appears to have been released in Germany in 2016. When a Romanian version was released the following year, the website Paginademedia reported that the ad had been created by Kastner & Partners, a German agency that has been working with Red Bull since 1985, and that it was later \u201cadapted\u201d into Romanian. The biggest difference between these two versions (as well as subsequent versions in other languages) can be seen in the final flag as it flies over the heads of riot police. In German, the flag is adorned with the word \u201cfreiheit.\u201d In Romania, the flag read \u201clibertate.\u201d In Portuguese, it read \u201cliberdade.\u201d These words can be translated to \u201cfreedom\u201d:\n\nWhile we\u2019ve come across several versions of this advertisement in other languages, we\u2019ve only been able to confirm that Red Bull was officially connected to the Portuguese and German versions. The Portuguese version is still on the company\u2019s website. The fact-checking project at the University of Hong Kong, in collaboration with Asian Network of News & Information Educators (ANNIE), found a print version of the German advertisement displayed in a gallery at Red Bull\u2019s Hangar 7 at the Salzburg Airport in Austria.\n\nAlthough it seems possible that Red Bull was behind the versions of this advertisement for Italy, Romania, and Hong Kong, we haven\u2019t been able to find versions of those videos on any official Red Bull property. Some of these edits may have been made by people unaffiliated with the company in order to support a local protest.\n\nFurthermore, the Hong Kong version of this ad that went viral in October 2019 did not originate with a post from an official Red Bull account. It does not appear on Red Bull\u2019s Hong Kong website nor on the brand\u2019s Hong Kong-based social media accounts. If this advertisement is truly an official Red Bull ad, it\u2019s likely that it was created circa 2016 and is unrelated to the current protests in Hong Kong.\n\nWe reached out to Red Bull for comment but did not hear back by press time.", "lang": "en"}
