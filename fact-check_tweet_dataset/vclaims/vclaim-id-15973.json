It has received more than 7,000 interactions (including likes, comments and shares) and more than 100,000 views to date. In this video, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claims that Gardasil is associated with \u201cautoimmune diseases and menstrual cycle problems and fertility problems\u201d. Gardasil is a vaccine against the human papillomavirus (HPV). Two forms of the vaccine are currently available, one which targets four HPV strains, namely HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18, which are responsible for most cases of cervical, anal, vulvar, vaginal, and penile cancer, as well as genital warts. The other vaccine targets nine HPV strains (HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58).\n\nThere is no scientific evidence supporting this claim. In fact, several studies conducted in different parts of the world have demonstrated that the HPV vaccine has an excellent safety profile. For example, a large-scale study in Denmark and Sweden examining almost a million girls found \u201cno evidence supporting associations between exposure to [the HPV] vaccine and autoimmune, neurological, and venous thromboembolic adverse events\u201d[1]. A study in France looking at more than 1,000 girls found that \u201cno evidence of an increase in the risk of the studied [autoimmune diseases] was observable following vaccination with Gardasil within the time periods studied\u201d[2]. A study in the United Kingdom \u201cfound no evidence of an increased risk of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome [a neurological disorder] following HPV vaccination\u201d[3]. Researchers in Norway found \u201cno indication of increased risk of [chronic fatigue syndrome] following HPV vaccination\u201d[4]. And a U.S. study found no association between the HPV vaccine and reduced fertility[5].\n\nSeveral other studies that analyzed the combined findings of multiple studies came to similar conclusions. A large meta-analysis of more than 100 studies and 2.5 million people found \u201cno consistent evidence of an increased risk\u201d of autoimmune or neurological problems[6], as did a U.S. review[7]. And a review of data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) showed no association between serious adverse events and the HPV vaccine in pregnant women and their children[8].\n\nIn 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a position paper on the use, safety, and effectiveness of the HPV vaccine. Safety evaluations were among the scientific evidence used to support its recommendation that \u201croutine HPV vaccination should be included in national immunization programmes\u201d. In the paper\u2019s summary, the WHO stated that \u201cHPV vaccines have an excellent safety profile\u201d.\n\n\n\n Jack Cuzick, John Snow Professor of Epidemiology, Wolfson Institute, Queen Mary University of London:\n\n This is not a defensible set of statements. There have been millions of girls vaccinated and nothing other than vaccine site reactions have been established despite widespread careful review[9,10,11].\n\nKevin Ault, Professor, University of Kansas School of Medicine:\n\n According to multiple well-done studies, the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is not associated with autoimmune or neurological diseases. A large Scandinavian study of approximately 1,000,000 adolescent females looked at 29 different autoimmune and neurological conditions and \u201cfound no evidence supporting associations between exposure to [\u2026] vaccine and autoimmune, neurological, and venous thromboembolic adverse events.\u201d[1] Another large meta-analysis of 2,500,000 subjects in 109 studies found \u201cno consistent evidence of an increased risk\u201d of autoimmune and neurological diseases[3]. It is inaccurate to state that this vaccine is associated with chronic health problems.\n\nWe previously fact-checked a claim that \u201cHPV vaccine may lead to elimination of cervical cancer\u201d, which was found to be accurate by reviewers.\n\u2022 1 \u2013 Arnheim-Dahlstr\u00f6m et al.
