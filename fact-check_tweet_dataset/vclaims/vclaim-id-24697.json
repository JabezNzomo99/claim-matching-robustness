In general, access to social security or family assistance payments is restricted to permanent visa holders and Australian citizens who are residing in Australia.\n\n\u201cThere are some exceptions which allow certain temporary visa holders limited access to some payments. These exceptions do not include holders of a temporary student visa.\u201d\n\nThe bottom photo in the misleading Facebook post shows two men in a rural location alongside a caption which states: \u201cBeen here 6 generations, gets loan to be repaid in full from the government.\u201d\n\nThe photograph has actually been taken from a commemorative stamp.\n\nA reverse image search on Google for the second photo leads to this September 2018 report published by The Parkes Champion-Post, a newspaper for the town of Parkes in the Central West region of New South Wales.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the report:\n\nThe photo caption states: \u201cParkes brothers Spike (in the background) and Tim Orr are the faces of a new special edition Drought Relief stamp released by Australia Post.\u201d\n\nThis report by agriculture news site The Land published on August 17, 2017, states the brothers are \u201cfifth generation\u201d farmers, not sixth as stated in the misleading Facebook post.", "lang": "en"}
