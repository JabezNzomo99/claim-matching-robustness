The issue gained further prominence recently with the Supreme Court rejecting a plea to reconsider its 1994 judgement, and the trial being pushed to the future.\n\nLast week, the controversy again made headlines after certain news organisations reported that \u201cMuslim women\u201d were supporting the cause of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. Reporting from Meerut, Amar Ujala published an article on November 25 titled \u2013\u201cWe swear on God, Mandir will be built there: Muslim women come forward, men\u2019s stance unclear (translated).\u201d\n\nGiving the impression that members of Meerut\u2019s Muslim women community came forward in support of Ram Mandir, Amar Ujala further reported \u2013 \u201c\u0905\u092f\u094b\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0930\u093e\u092e \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930 \u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0923 \u0915\u094b \u0932\u0947\u0915\u0930 \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u091c\u092c\u0930\u0926\u0938\u094d\u0924 \u0939\u0932\u091a\u0932 \u0936\u0941\u0930\u0942 \u0939\u094b \u091a\u0941\u0915\u0940 \u0939\u0948\u0964 \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0942 \u0938\u0902\u0917\u0920\u0928\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u092e\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0932\u093f\u092e \u092e\u0939\u093f\u0932\u093e\u0913\u0902 \u0928\u0947 \u092d\u0940 \u0930\u093e\u092e \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930 \u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0923 \u0915\u094b \u0932\u0947\u0915\u0930 \u0906\u0935\u093e\u091c \u0909\u0920\u093e\u0928\u0940 \u0936\u0941\u0930\u0942 \u0915\u0930 \u0926\u0940 \u0939\u0948\u0964 (There is an immense bustle in the country regarding the issue of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. Along with Hindu organisations, Muslim women have also begun to raise their voices vis-a-vis its construction).\u201d\n\nSubsequently, the media outlet mentioned the names of two women spearheading the campaign \u2013 Shaheen Parvez of \u2018Muslim Rashtriya Manch\u2019 and Sadya Subuhi of \u2018Rashtriya Ekta Mission\u2019. However, an essential aspect regarding the identity of these women (and their organisations) was omitted by Amar Ujala.\n\nBoth Parvez and Subuhi pioneered the \u2018Ram Mandir\u2019 campaign under the banner of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)-affiliated organisations. This vital information was left out in Amar Ujala\u2019s report, giving the impression that a mass of Muslim women from Meerut extended their support to the cause of Ram Mandir.\n\nMuslim Rashtriya Manch and Rashtriya Ekta Mission have been in media reports earlier. In 2016, NDTV reported the recruitment of BJP\u2019s Sanjay Joshi, a vocal critic of PM Modi, for appeasing members of the Muslim community for the party. The news outlet said, \u201c\u091c\u094b\u0936\u0940 \u0932\u0916\u0928\u090a \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0938\u093e\u0924 \u091c\u0942\u0928 \u0915\u094b \u0938\u0902\u0918 \u0915\u0947 \u0906\u0928\u0941\u0937\u093e\u0902\u0917\u093f\u0915 \u0938\u0902\u0917\u0920\u0928 \u092e\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0932\u093f\u092e \u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092f \u092e\u0902\u091a \u0914\u0930 \u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092f \u090f\u0915\u0924\u093e \u092e\u093f\u0936\u0928 \u0915\u0947 \u092c\u0948\u0928\u0930 \u0924\u0932\u0947 \u0907\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0916\u092c\u093e\u0932\u0947 \u092e\u093e\u0939\u0947 \u0930\u092e\u091c\u093e\u0928\u0941\u0932 \u092e\u0941\u092c\u093e\u0930\u0915 \u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092e\u0941\u0916\u094d\u092f \u0905\u0924\u093f\u0925\u093f \u0915\u0940 \u0939\u0948\u0938\u093f\u092f\u0924 \u0938\u0947 \u0936\u093e\u092e\u093f\u0932 \u0939\u094b\u0902\u0917\u0947\u0964 (Joshi was due as a guest at a Ramzan event in Lucknow organised under the banner of RSS-affiliated Muslim Rashtriya Manch and Rashtriya Ekta Mission).\u201d\n\nLast year, the RSS had floated a new affiliate Shri Ram Mandir Nirman Sahayog Manch (SRMNSM) to build mass support for Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. The Caravan reported earlier in October 2018 that this outfit was directly placed under the supervision of Muslim Rashtriya Manch or MRM. Senior RSS leader Indresh Kumar is associated with both these organisations. The Caravan further reported that the national co-convener of MRM said that the outfit is supported by other \u201clike-minded\u201d organisations and among these was the Rashtriya Ekta Mission.\n\nMoreover, MRM\u2019s Shaheen Parvez distinctly terms herself as \u201cadvocate BJP\u201d on Facebook; her display picture and her photograph at the \u2018Ram Mandir\u2019 event are both with Kumar.\n\nDespite the clear link, RSS had previously denied connection with the Muslim Rashtriya Manch, calling it an \u201cindependent organisation.\u201d\n\nHowever, the outfit itself mentions on its website that it is a part of RSS.\n\nFurthermore, Kumar\u2019s continuous presence in their events and earlier media reports terming the organisation as an \u201cRSS affiliate\u201d point to the connection.\n\nSeveral other media outlets also carried out misleading reports, excluding the identity of the Muslim women who took part in the \u2018Ram Mandir\u2019 event.\n\nNews18 UP tweeted as \u2018breaking news\u2019 \u2013 \u201cMeerut: Big statement by Muslim women on the Ram Mandir construction issue. Swear on God, Mandir will be built there. Everyone\u2019s faith is attached with Shri Ram\u2019s birthplace and Muslims have nothing to do with Babri Masjid. Even Muslims were enslaved by Babur (translated).\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Patrika also carried out a misleading report titled \u2013 \u201cMuslim women who provide religious education took such an oath regarding Ram Mandir that everyone will be stunned, watch video (translated).\u201d Even though this article mentioned that the event was held was \u2018Rashtriya Muslim Manch\u2019, it was devoid of its affiliation to the RSS.\n\nCiting Patrika as the source, Catch News also carried out an erroneous story titled \u2013 \u201cAmid Dharam Sabha in Ayodhya, Muslim women pledge open support for Ram Mandir, say \u2018Kasam Khuda ki khaate hai, mandir wahin banayenge.\u201d\n\nHowever, the outlet included later in the article that the event was organised by RSS and Vishwa Hindu Parishad.\n\nOpIndia also joined the bandwagon of misleading reportage. With its report titled \u2013 \u201c\u2018Kasam Khuda ki khaate hai, mandir wahin banayenge\u2019, Muslim women pledge support for Ram Mandir\u201d \u2013 the outlet gave the impression that an excess of Muslim women backed the cause of the temple. Moreover, not only did OpIndia omit the RSS connection, the image used by the outlet was that of Nazneen Ansari, leader of a separate Varanasi-based RSS offset Muslim Mahila Foundation (MMF). Alt News had reported about MMF in an earlier article.\n\nWe have often observed in the past that RSS-affiliated Muslim organisations are reported as \u201cMuslim women\u201d or \u201cMuslims\u201d espousing Hindu causes or rituals. For instance, ANI and News18 had in June misreported members of an RSS affiliate as \u201cMuslims in Lucknow\u201d celebrating Bakrid by cutting a cake. The recent example only adds to how misleading reportage gives readers a wrong impression that members of the Muslim community are backing the construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.", "lang": "en"}
