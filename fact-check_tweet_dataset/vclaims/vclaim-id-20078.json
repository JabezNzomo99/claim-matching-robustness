And the Hoover Dam in five years. Think of that. It should not take 10 years to get approvals for a very small, little piece of infrastructure. And it won\u2019t.\u201d\n\n \u2014 Trump, remarks in Ohio on infrastructure, June 7 speech\n\nTrump claimed that regulations and permitting for infrastructure takes \u201cas much as a decade\u201d now, compared to the four or five years it took to build the Golden Gate Bridge and the Hoover Dam. But what he didn\u2019t say is that, it actually took many more years to plan for those projects. We dug in.\n\nIn 1916, San Francisco officials requested plans for a bridge that crossed the Golden Gate Strait. They didn\u2019t accept their city engineer\u2019s proposal because it was too expensive. In 1921, an engineer named Joseph Strauss submitted a satisfactory \u2014 and cheaper \u2014 proposal. It took Strauss a year and half to vet his project design with residents in northern California communities and convince them to agree to it before he could move forward with the project.\n\nThe War Department granted a final permit for Strauss in 1930 \u2014 nine years after he submitted his original design. During those nine years, Strauss\u2019s staff \u201cwas responsible for directing the thousands of calculations required, for the computation of stresses, the preparation of stress sheets, as well as the development of the specifications, contracts and proposal forms,\u201d according to the Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Transportation District.\n\nPreparing for the construction of the dam was a herculean task. Supportive public infrastructure had to be built before construction on the actual dam could begin. According to the Bureau of Reclamation, these projects \u201cincluded transportation and communication facilities, housing, water and sewage systems, power and lighting facilities, and a 150-ton cable way for handling heavy equipment at the dam site.\u201d\n\nThe Bureau of Reclamation awarded the construction contract for the Hoover Dam in 1932. President Roosevelt dedicated the dam in 1935, and the dam was officially operating and open for visitors by 1937. So it took roughly five years for the dam to get built and become operational.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the building of the bridge,\u201d said Henry Petroski, Duke University professor and civil engineering historian. \u201cYou can\u2019t just look at when the first groundbreaking ceremony took place and when the ribbon was cut to open the bridge. That may take four years, but it could be decades before that\u201d to plan and get approved.\n\nIt took major coordination leading up to the Hoover Dam\u2019s construction to get several states bordering the Colorado River to agree on the plan, said Petroski, author of \u201cThe Road Taken: The History and Future of America\u2019s Infrastructure.\u201d It\u2019s not exactly a regulation, but it took a tremendous amount of negotiating between state governments to all agree and \u201cappreciate the benefits that would accrue to them.\u201d\n\nTrump describes the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge and Hoover Dam as projects that were constructed over four or five years, unbound by the years of permitting and regulatory restrictions that current-day projects face. But Trump only focuses on the literal construction of the projects, and overlooks the many years of bureaucratic negotiating and regulating that took place leading up to the construction.\n\nMassive infrastructure projects don\u2019t just spring up over four or five years. In making a case for changing regulations that he views as cumbersome, the president creates a misleading picture by minimizing the many years of planning, permitting, negotiating and preparation that were required for the two projects to make sure they were environmentally, bureaucratically and financially feasible.
