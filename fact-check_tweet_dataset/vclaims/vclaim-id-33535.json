Many people used #100DaysofKashmirSiege on Twitter to share their views on the government clampdown.\n\n\n\nOne such individual was Suhaib Saqib, who describes himself as a London-based \u201cactivist on Kashmir and Islamophobia.\u201d Saqib tweeted a video saying, \u201cA Kashmiri Muslim child has just been tortured to death by RSS Hindutva Nazi goons. My question to western leaders: would you allow this to happen to your children & silently spectate? Can any sane mind justify this? #100DaysOfKashmirSiege.\u201d The video in Suhaib\u2019s tweet is violent, viewer discretion is advised.\n\nThe same video was shared by Saqib on his Facebook profile as well.\n\nThis video was fact-checked by Alt News last month in the article \u2018Murder-accused brutally beaten in Bihar; police deny communal angle.\u2019 The incident took place in Kaimur\u2019s Bhabua Nagar, a district in Bihar on October 2, 2019. The same video was shared on October 5, 2019, by Md Salim, a Politburo member-CPI(M). Salim later took down the clip.\n\nThe victim\u2019s name is Shahid Rain. He was thrashed after allegedly killing Madhav Singh, a resident of Sikhathi village. \u201cThere is no communal angle to the crime. They had a land dispute\u201d, said SHO Shashi Bhushan to Alt News. Kaimur Superintendent of Police, Dilnawaz Ahmed, also informed that there was no communal angle to the incident. An FIR was lodged against the men who assaulted Shahid.\n\nThe video shared by Saqib on Twitter, which was also pinned on his profile on November 12, 2019, has gone viral. The claim made by him \u2013 \u2018a Kashmiri Muslim child has just been tortured to death by RSS Hindutva Nazi goons\u2019 \u2013 is false. In fact, it\u2019s an incident from Kaimur, a district in Bihar in October. Read the full report here.", "lang": "en"}
