For years, the lab has been a regular target of Russian disinformation, accused of viral outbreaks, including the coronavirus, and horror stories about experiments on human patients.\n\nSuch stories have been routinely debunked. Moreover, the lab (named after former U.S. Sen. Richard Lugar) focuses on studying \u2013 not manufacturing \u2013 various biological pathogens and not chemical weapons.\n\nThe United States has destroyed nearly all of its chemical weapons stockpiles under the terms of an international convention. What remains is located at the Blue Grass Army Depot near Richmond, Kentucky, and is expected to be gone by September 2023.\n\nThe weapons stockpiled at the depot consist of World War II-era shells and rockets. Novichok was invented in the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s and only became known to Western countries in the 1990s.\n\nShvytkin\u2019s suggestion that the nerve agent used on Navalny came from outside Russia contradicts other Russian claims that he was not poisoned at all.\n\nAs Polygraph.info reported on Sept. 2, Leonid Rink, the former director of the laboratory where Novichok was developed, claimed that Navalny \u2013 who remains comatose in a Berlin hospital \u2013 did not show symptoms of Novichok poisoning, specifically convulsions.\n\nIn fact, Navalny was seen exhibiting signs similar to convulsions when he suddenly fell ill on a plane traveling from Omsk to Moscow on Aug. 20. What\u2019s more, doctors in the Russian city of Omsk initially diagnosed Navalny with acute poisoning before reversing themselves and denying that any toxins had been found in his system.\n\nThe rapid spread of contradictory explanations for what happened to Navalny mirrors Russia\u2019s reaction to the poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, England, which also led to the inadvertent poisoning of two British citizens, one of whom, Dawn Sturgess, died.\n\nWithin approximately one month of the initial Salisbury incident in March 2018, disinformation monitors found that Russia had produced nearly 37 different alternate narratives to deflect blame away from Moscow.\n\nThese ranged from claims that the Skripals had actually overdosed on the narcotic fentanyl, to narratives that acknowledged the poison was Novichok but blamed other countries, including Ukraine and the U.K., for the poisoning.\n\nInvestigators in the U.K. determined that two suspected Russian agents were responsible for the attack on the Skripals, who survived and are now under protection. Boris Johnson, then Britain\u2019s foreign minister, said British intelligence found more complicity.\n\n\"We actually have evidence within the last 10 years that Russia has not only been investigating the delivery of nerve agents for the purposes of assassination, but has also been creating and stockpiling Novichok,\" Johnson, who is now prime minister, told the BBC.\n\nTo date, the Kremlin has categorically denied any involvement in the Salisbury poisonings. Similarly, it has strenuously disputed the German findings, which were announced Wednesday (Sept. 2) by Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\n\u201cBefore the patient was taken to Germany, in accordance with all international standards, a whole series of tests was done in Russia, and no poisonous substance was found,\u201d said Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov.\n\n\u201cThere are no grounds to accuse the Russian state. And we are not inclined to accept any accusations in this respect,\u201d Peskov said.\n\nAlexei Navalny has spent years earning his reputation as one of Putin\u2019s most prominent critics. He began by blogging about high-level corruption within Putin\u2019s inner circle, as well as among members of the ruling United Russia party. He was a regular attendee and speaker at public protests \u2013 when he wasn\u2019t detained by authorities for various reasons. In 2013, he ran for mayor of Moscow, scoring second place with much higher support than expected.\n\nNavalny\u2019s Anti-Corruption Foundation has produced numerous video investigations of high-level Russian officials, including 2017\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Call Him Dimon,\u201d which exposed the vast wealth and property of then-Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.\n\nIn recent years, Navalny has been the target of physical attacks, often being doused with a medical chemical that dyes the skin green for a long duration. In the summer of 2019, he was hospitalized in another suspected poisoning, although he quickly recovered.", "lang": "en"}
