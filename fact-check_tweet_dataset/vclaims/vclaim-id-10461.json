Comey had testified before Congress about portions of the memos, but they became public in their entirety for the first time on April 19, which prompted Trump to claim the memos cleared his name.\n\n\"James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nComey has said he made written records of his meetings with Trump in part due to concerns the president might lie about their discussions. Here, Trump\u2019s tweet badly mischaracterizes their contents.\n\nNowhere in Comey\u2019s memos does he say that Trump did not collude or obstruct justice.\n\nLet\u2019s recap how the memos came to be.\n\nIn July 2016, when Comey was still FBI director, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. After Trump was elected, Comey made contemporaneous notes of seven discussions he had with Trump.\n\nOn May 9, 2017, Trump fired Comey as FBI director. From this point forward, Comey would have no role investigating Trump campaign ties to Russia.\n\nLater that month, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel. Mueller was authorized to lead the investigation into possible connections between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, as well as other matters that \"may arise directly from the investigation.\" (Rosenstein was acting as attorney general in place of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from the investigation.)\n\nHere\u2019s the key point: After the reins were passed from Comey to Mueller, the investigation into contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia escalated dramatically. Comey wasn\u2019t in any position to make definitive statements about whether collusion existed or not.\n\nTo date, Mueller\u2019s investigation has swept up four members of Trump\u2019s campaign, including three who have agreed to work with Mueller\u2019s team as part of a plea deal. Mueller\u2019s probe is ongoing, and he has yet to issue a final determination on the collusion question.\n\nThe idea that the memos exonerate Trump on charges of obstruction of justice is even weaker.\n\nFor starters, Comey\u2019s memos contain details that many experts would consider legally relevant in an obstruction case against Trump.\n\nThe memos describe a one-on-one dinner with Trump on Jan. 27, 2017, at the White House, where Trump turned the conversation to whether Comey wanted to stay on as FBI director. Comey has said he suspected Trump was seeking a \"patronage relationship\" with him.\n\nComey\u2019s memo goes on to state that Trump explicitly requested his loyalty later that evening, saying, \"I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.\"\n\nThe memos also describe a private meeting at the White House the following month, in which Trump asked Comey to drop the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, saying, \"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go.\"\n\nFinally, two days after Comey\u2019s ouster, Trump said in a nationally televised interview that he\u2019d been thinking about the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation when he fired Comey.\n\n\"When I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story,\" Trump told NBC\u2019s Lester Holt.\n\nAs in the case of the collusion question, Mueller has yet to issue a final determination on whether Trump obstructed justice.\n\nEven when the Comey memos are read in a light most favorable to Trump, they still don\u2019t support his claim that the writings exonerate him.\n\nComey\u2019s memos show Trump repeatedly asking for his help to \"lift the cloud\" being cast over his presidency by the Russia probe. Comey writes that he reassured Trump multiple times that the FBI was not investigating him.\n\nBut Comey\u2019s final memo was written more than a year ago, before Mueller ramped up the investigation and before Trump admitted he had been thinking about the Russia investigation when he fired Comey.\n\nMore recently, Comey addressed the investigation in his memoir A Higher Loyalty, where he holds open the possibility of criminal wrongdoing:\n\n\"One of the pivotal questions I presume that Bob Mueller\u2019s team is investigating is whether or not in urging me to back the FBI off our investigation of his national security adviser and in firing me, President Trump was attempting to obstruct justice, which is a federal crime. It\u2019s certainly possible. There is at least circumstantial evidence in that regard, and there may be more that the Mueller team will assemble.\"\n\nTrump said the Comey memos \"show clearly\" that there was no collusion and no obstruction of justice.\n\nNowhere in Comey\u2019s memos does he say that Trump did not collude nor obstruct justice. And in the year since Comey penned his last Trump memo, a special counsel has been appointed who has escalated the investigation. That investigation has resulted in other charges against four members of Trump\u2019s campaign, including three who have agreed to plea deals.\n\nIn his book, Comey writes that the memos and the circumstances of his firing may be legally relevant to an obstruction case against Trump. Comey has also held open the possibility that Trump may ultimately be found to have committed criminal wrongdoing.\n\nWe rate this Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
