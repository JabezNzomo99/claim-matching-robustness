Sometimes the accompanying text claims it shows \u201cthe world\u2019s tiniest poisonous snake\u201d while another claims (in Portuguese) that it\u2019s a worm that can infect and kill humans.\n\nThe video shows neither. We asked experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine what they thought.\n\nCheryl Whitehorn, a medical entomologist at the university\u2019s Diagnostic Parasitology Laboratory, said that it wasn\u2019t a snake, venomous or otherwise.\n\nShe said: \u201cIt may be a nematode worm of some type but is certainly not one that we cover in our studies and is therefore unlikely to be of any medical importance.\u201d\n\nThe NHS does recommend that you wash raw vegetables and fruit before eating, mainly to avoid E. coli.", "lang": "en"}
