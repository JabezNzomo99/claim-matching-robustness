Later, he was the only person to be convicted in the US in connection to the September 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nBefore he became an MP and then Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan was a solicitor specialising in human rights.\n\nThe Guardian reported in 2016 that Mr Khan had said he\u2019d never represented Zacarias Moussaoui, but that his firm had consulted on Moussaoui\u2019s defence. The mayor\u2019s office confirmed to us that Mr Khan was consulting for the defence on that case, but did not represent Moussaoui and has never met him.\n\nThe image in the post of a man standing behind a woman comes from a 2002 news report in French recorded at the start of Moussaoui\u2019s trial in Alexandria, Virginia. The woman being interviewed is Zacarias Moussaoui\u2019s mother, Aicha el-Wafi.\n\nThe man standing behind her is Mr Khan, and the Mayor of London\u2019s office confirmed this to us.\n\nThere are court documents mentioning Mr Khan\u2014the defendant seems to have personally asked for Mr Khan to have security clearance to meet him. The response from the US government, which was prosecuting, reasoned that they should not be allowed to meet. A ruling from the judge in October 2002 denied the request. The Mayor of London\u2019s office confirmed to us that Mr Khan never met Moussaoui.\n\nMr Khan could not have represented the defendant, because (as pointed out by the US government) he wasn\u2019t licensed to practise law in that region.\n\nZacarias Moussaoui was sentenced in 2006, after Sadiq Khan left the law firm to campaign to be an MP in 2004.", "lang": "en"}
