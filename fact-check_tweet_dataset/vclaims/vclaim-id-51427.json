A Twitter user posted the viral video with the caption, \u201cToday it\u2019s starting with goats. Tomorrow it may start from homes. This is the scene from the Maharashtra-Gujarat border. There\u2019s no one to stop the public robbery of goats.\u201d The clip has been shared as Eid al-Adha or Bakrid concluded last week.\n\nAn identical post was shared by a Facebook user as well.\n\nThe viral video has also been shared with a lengthy text on WhatsApp \u2014 \u201cHave you ever seen such robbery? This is from Maharashtra border in a changing India. This is the last straw of the dirty politics in India, a helpless animal is being dragged on the streets. This is a matter of shame. This has happened because of the weakens and carelessness of Indian Muslim politicians and Maharashtra government\u2019s hypocrisy. The public will remember this.\u201d\n\nAlt News received several requests to fact-check the video on our official Android application.\n\nAlt News analysed the viral video using InVid, an online video verification tool, and performed a reverse image search of the first frame on Google. We found an identical image posted by a Facebook page called 2M, a Moroccan television network, and a Morocco-based journalist Abdelaziz joubi who works at Souss Plus. This was on July 31.\n\nWe also found a tweet by 2M that offers context to the incident. As per the tweet, the video shows theft and stone-pelting at a sheep market. Twenty people, including eight minors, were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the violence.\n\nUsing this information, we performed a keyword search and found a report by Morocco World News on the incident from July 31. As per the report, the incident took place at Azmat, a livestock market in Casablanca. The report added that several videos about the incident have gone viral. The videos show people not wearing facemasks which led the government to shut down seven livestock markets.\n\nThe report includes a statement from the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN). \u201cThe thefts were accompanied by an exchange of stone-throwing between citizens and sellers of livestock in the market\u2026Security services have so far not received any complaints about theft in connection with this case, on which research continues.\u201d\n\nThus, the social media claim that the video shows theft of goats in Maharasthra is baseless and false. The video shows a stone-pelting incident at a Moroccan-livestock market.", "lang": "en"}
