This page comes from a book called \u201cEnd of Days: Predictions and Prophecies About the End of the World\u201d by Sylvia Browne, an American author who claimed to be a psychic. The paragraph visible in the photograph in the claim is visible on Google books ( here ). \u200bThe page includes the text, \u201cIn around 2020 a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread throughout the globe, attacking the lungs and the bronchial tubes and resisting all known treatments\u201d.\n\nReuters has done a similar fact-check that debunks the claim that a 1981 Dean Koontz book predicted the coronavirus, some iterations of which included this page from Browne\u2019s book ( here ). \u200bThe photograph has been recycled into a new false claim. The reason this claim names the year 1981 may be due to the publishing date of Koontz's book.\n\nThe Old Farmer's Almanac is a publication that was founded in 1792.
