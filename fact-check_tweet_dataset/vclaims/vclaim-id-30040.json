Yediyurappa, rose angrily from his seat when a seer has spoken against CAA on a stage in his presence. Let\u2019s try to analyze the authenticity of the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: A video of Karnataka CM\u2019s spat with the Panchamasali Mutt seer on the stage over CAA. Fact: The seer in the video did not speak about CAA at all. The CM rose up in anger because the seer threatened the CM that the Panchamasali Lingayat community may pull out its support if the CM doesn\u2019t back MLA Murugesh Nirani. So, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen a screenshot of the video in the post was searched on Google, an article written by \u2018The Hindu\u2019 newspaper was found. According to the article, the event in the video took place at the \u2018Hara Jatre\u2019 event in Harihar of Davangere district on 14th January 2020. At that event, the seer of Panchamasali Mutt, Sri Vachanananda Swami said that the Panchamasali Lingayat community may withdraw its support if the CM doesn\u2019t support MLA Murugesh Nirani. Angered by the seer\u2019s statement, the CM rose from his seat to leave the stage but was later pacified. The same can be read in the ANI\u2019s tweet on the issue. So, the seer in the video didn\u2019t speak anything against CAA, but on a different issue that made the CM angry.\n\nTo summarize, the video of Karnataka CM B.S. Yediyurappa, rising angrily over a seer\u2019s statement on an entirely different issue is being falsely shared in the context of CAA.\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
