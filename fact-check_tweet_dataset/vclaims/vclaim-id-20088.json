Many readers asked about the uncorrected version, which initially claimed \u201cthe link to political incitement was clear\u201d between the gunman\u2019s actions and the map portraying crosshairs, including one over Giffords\u2019s congressional district in Southern Arizona.\n\nThe Fact Checker is not a media critic, nor is it an opinion column that argues with other editorial opinions. We don\u2019t play gotcha, and we appreciate when falsehoods are corrected. But this episode showed how pervasive this debunked talking point still is on the political left, and we wanted to set the record straight.\n\nGun control is back in the national debate, after the shooting Wednesday at a baseball practice among congressional Republicans. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) was critically injured, and four others were wounded. The shooting quickly became political. The gunman, who died after a shootout with police, had volunteered for the 2016 Democratic presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and posted angry and vulgar comments on social media aimed at President Trump.\n\nJared Lee Loughner shot Giffords in the head during a Jan. 8, 2011, constituent event, then opened fire on the people lined up to meet her there \u2014 injuring 14 and killing six. Contemporaneous news reports noted that Giffords was one of 20 Democrats targeted in a map circulated by Sarah Palin\u2019s political action committee in March 2010. The map portrayed stylized crosshairs to mark each of their districts, in a \u201cTake Back the 20\u2033 campaign to reclaim seats in the 2010 midterm elections.\n\nAfter the map was published, Giffords said in an interview: \u201cWe\u2019re on Sarah Palin\u2019s targeted list, but the thing is that the way that she has it depicted has the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district, and when people do that, they\u2019ve got to realize there are consequences to that action.\u201d\n\nAfter Loughner\u2019s shooting, some of Palin\u2019s surrogates claimed the map was never intended to portray crosshairs, and instead said they were \u201csurveyor\u2019s symbols.\u201d But that was debunked by Palin herself, when she acknowledged that the symbols were intended to be crosshairs.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Loughner even knew of Palin\u2019s map, but it probably would not have changed the outcome. His focus on Giffords began as early as 2007, long before the map was published. He became fixated on her since he met her at a constituent event in 2007, and decided he was unsatisfied by her answer to his question: \u201cIf words could not be understood, then what does government mean?\u201d\n\nThree days after the shooting, authorities filed criminal charges against Loughner after finding items in his home that showed he had plotted her assassination. They found in his safe a 2007 letter from Giffords thanking him for attending the constituent event, and an envelope stating \u201cI planned ahead,\u201d and the words \u201cassassination\u201d and \u201cGiffords,\u201d along with his signature.\n\nLoughner had no clear political views. Instead, he was a troubled man who abused alcohol and drugs, and whose mental illness was apparent to his classmates and family even before he was diagnosed as schizophrenic during his court trial.\n\nHis behavior became so erratic and disruptive that he was suspended from college in 2010 and told he couldn\u2019t return without a doctor\u2019s note confirming he was not a danger. He withdrew from school, then his behavior got worse. In the days leading up to the shooting, his behavior became so disturbing that his father disabled Loughner\u2019s car at night so that he couldn\u2019t leave the house.\n\nWe\u2019re glad to see this fixed in the editorial, but it\u2019s not a good sign that the debunked talking point was included as fact in the editorial of a major media outlet. Any future references to this talking point by politicians or political groups will receive Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
