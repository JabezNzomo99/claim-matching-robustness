We turned to original sources.\n\nMeasured by total oil consumption, the United States does rank first in the world, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2019, a comprehensive review of data on global energy.\n\nIn 2018, the United States consumed 20,456,000 barrels a day -- far beyond the second-place nation, China, with 13,525,000 barrels a day.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that using the overall consumption figure is an imperfect method for measuring global oil consumption\n\nOil consumption \"is related to two factors -- high consumption and population size,\" said Anna Mikulska, a nonresident fellow at the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.\n\nBecause larger countries will usually have larger totals than smaller countries, it\u2019s also important to look at per capita consumption -- consumption divided by population.\n\nBy this measure, the United States is near the top, but it isn\u2019t quite No. 1.\n\nAccording to calculations by Eni, an Italian oil company, the United States ranked third internationally in per capita oil consumption. Saudi Arabia ranked first with 34.91 barrels a year, followed by Canada with 24.16 barrels and the United States with 23.12 barrels.\n\nOjeda said the United States is \"#1 in oil consumption\" in the world. That\u2019s correct for total consumption, but that\u2019s partly because of the United States\u2019 large population. On a per capita basis, the United States ranks third behind Saudi Arabia and Canada.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
