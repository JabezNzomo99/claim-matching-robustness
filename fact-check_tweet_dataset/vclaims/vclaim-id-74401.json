This footage was slowed down and miscaptioned in an apparent attempt to get viewers to believe that Pelosi was drunk and slurring her speech. This is at least the second time that a video of Pelosi was manipulated in this fashion.\n\nThe above-displayed video uses footage from a news conference held on May 20, 2020. Pelosi was responding to a question from a reporter about whether it was appropriate for the president of the United States to falsely accuse a television host \u2014 MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough \u2014 of murder. In addition to slowing down Pelosi\u2019s speech, the above-displayed video also contains several edits and omits much of Pelosi\u2019s response.\n\nHere\u2019s a transcript of the genuine exchange. The moment can be glimpsed at the 17:20 mark of the following video:\n\nQ: On a different topic, and because he brought it up on Twitter again today, is it appropriate for the President to accuse a TV host of murder on Twitter? Speaker Pelosi. I\u2019m sorry. To do what? Q: This is the Joe Scarborough \u2013 Speaker Pelosi. What did he do? Q: This is the Joe Scarborough issue. He tweeted last Tuesday that he wondered if he\u2019d gotten away with murder. He retweeted this morning about \u2018psycho,\u2019 as he calls him, \u2018Psycho Joe.\u2019 Q: Yes. Is it appropriate for the President to do that on Twitter, or to do that in general? Speaker Pelosi. You\u2019re asking me about the appropriateness of the actions of this President of the United States? So completely inappropriate in so many ways that it\u2019s almost a given. It\u2019s like a child that comes in with mud on their pants or something. That\u2019s the way it is. They\u2019re outside playing, that\u2019s the way \u2013 he comes in with doggy doo on his shoes, and everybody who works with him has that on their shoes too, for a very long time to come. So, I don\u2019t know. I hear doctors talk to me about \u2013 saying, you know, \u2018What\u2019s the matter with him? The things he says are so inappropriate for a President of the United States.\u2019 The comments he makes about women \u2013 the comments he makes about women \u2013 so inappropriate. So, no, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate. But, again, there\u2019s a market for it, obviously, and that\u2019s what he plays to. What it is \u2013 there\u2019s a word somebody used to me. They said, you would understand it better if you knew what a confabulator is. Confabulator? Speaker Pelosi. \u2013 confabulator is. Look up the word \u2018confabulator.\u2019 Somebody who just really doesn\u2019t even know what the truth is and just says anything. And because he says it, then he believes it. But you know what? Forget about him. This is about how we go forward to help save lives, save the livelihood of our people by saving our economy and how we prepare ourselves to go into the future in a very positive way. It\u2019s just something that is in our midst that we have to deal with. And we would hope that the American people would see very clearly \u2013 whatever they think of him, love him or not \u2013 love yourself. Vote for your interests. Because if you\u2019re a person who\u2019s lost your job through no fault of your own, this Heroes bill, this Heroes Act, this bill is for you. If you\u2019re somebody who is uncertain as to whether you\u2019re going to be able to feed your family, this bill\u2019s for you. If you have uncertainty about the fear that you might contract or be infected by this virus or that you could carry it home to your children or to your parents, older parents, this bill\u2019s for you. And if you are a public employee working to save lives: a police officer, firefighter, transit worker, teacher, anybody in the public sector who meets the needs of the American people, your job is in doubt unless this bill passes. This bill\u2019s \u2013 this bill is for you.\n\nContent falsely labeling Pelosi as \u201cdrunk\u201d has become increasingly common on the internet. We\u2019ve previously investigated false claims that accused Pelosi of being escorted out of the White House, being removed from a charity event, and of causing a drunken-driving accident.\n\nIn May 2019, a deceptively edited video that had been slowed down to make it appear as if Pelosi was slurring her words was shared on social media by high-profile political players such as Rudy Giuliani.", "lang": "en"}
