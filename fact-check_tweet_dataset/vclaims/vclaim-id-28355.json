Intimidating & silencing a free press is an assault on basic freedoms. The government should change course immediately.\u201d\n\nIn response, Kyrgyzstan\u2019s Foreign Ministry called the committee\u2019s tweet \u201can attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign state, as well as pressure on the judiciary of the Kyrgyz Republic.\u201d\n\nThe ministry also stated: \u201cWe especially note that in Kyrgyzstan there are no restrictions whatsoever on the activities of the media.\u201d\n\nThe Paris-based Reporters Without Borders (RSF) ranked Kyrgyzstan 83rd out of the 180 nations on its 2019 World Press Freedom index. RSF ranked four other Central Asian states even lower: Turkmenistan was ranked the worst in the world \u2013 180th \u2013 behind Tajikistan (161st), Uzbekistan (160th) and Kazakhstan (158th).\n\nStill, according to RSF, while the 2017 presidential elections in Kyrgyzstan ended \u201cauthoritarian excesses\u201d there, the media environment in the country remains vulnerable due to the lack of judicial independence. While the country\u2019s current leader, Sooronbay Jeenbekov, is seen as more progressive than former president Almazbek Atabayev, who is under investigation for alleged corruption, RSF says Kyrgyzstan needs to reform its defamation and anti-extremism laws, which make it possible to target journalists with \u201cill-advised\u201d criminal prosecutions.\n\nIn its most recent annual Freedom in the World report, Freedom House rated Kyrgyzstan as \u201cpartly free,\u201d and noted that Kyrgyz journalists \u201ccontinued to risk arrest, prosecution, and civil suits for critical reporting in 2018.\u201d\n\nAccording to media experts in Kyrgyzstan, the Kyrgyz state continues to use the legal system against the independent press. Lawsuits and arrests targeting investigative journalists are used to suppress media pluralism and promote self-censorship, with expensive defamation suits crippling independent outlets.\n\nTwo recent cases involve the independent agency Koop.kg and the Kyrgyz language service of the U.S. government-funded broadcaster RFE/RL.\n\nReporters for the two outlets face hefty fines and possible prison terms as a result of defamation suits filed against them for investigative reports about corruption schemes involving former and current Kyrgyz government officials.\n\nThe investigations, conducted jointly by Kloop.kz, RFE/RL\u2019s Kyrgyz service and the Budapest-based Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) in April 2019, uncovered a corruption scheme involving current and former government officials who embezzled 940 million Kyrgyz soms ($13.4 million). The investigations were based on information provided by a whistleblower, who claimed that hundreds of millions of dollars had been moved out of Kyrgyzstan through a business network led by a secretive Chinese-born Uyghur who was a citizen of Kazakhstan. Authorities later said that the total sum stolen by the network was nearly $1 billion.\n\nLast week, a court in Bishkek froze the bank accounts of RFE/RL correspondent Ali Toktakunov, RFE/RL's Kyrgyz Service and OCCRP partner Kloop.kz as part of a libel suit filed on behalf of the family of Raimbek Matraimov, a former deputy head of the country\u2019s customs service. The independent website 24.kg, which published a summary of the corruption investigations, also had its bank account frozen.\n\nFollowing a public outcry, the Matraimov family withdrew its demand and the court unfroze the accounts.\n\nThe Matraimov family claims that the reports damaged their \"honor, dignity, and business reputations.\" It is demanding that the defendants pay the equivalent of $860,000.\n\nOn Dec. 18, people took to the streets of Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan\u2019s capital, to protest corruption and the prosecution and arrest of journalists.\n\nA mass protest against corruption had taken place in Bishkek just two weeks earlier -- on Nov. 25.\n\nAccording to rights groups, justice has not yet been done for two Kyrgyz journalists victimized in previous decades.\n\nOn Oct. 24, 2007, Alisher Saipov, editor of the independent weekly Siyosat (Politics) and contributor to RFE/RL and the Voice of America, was shot three times by an unknown gunman, using a silencer. He died at the scene.\n\nThe man convicted of Saipov\u2019s assassination and sentenced to 20 years in prison was released after new evidence proved he was with relatives at the time of the killing. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) suspects state involvement in the assassination and has labeled Saipov\u2019s murder as a case of \u201ccomplete impunity.\u201d\n\nIn September 2010, Azimjon Askarov, the editor of an independent newspaper in Kyrgyzstan, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison on charges that international press freedom and human rights watchdogs say were trumped up.\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Committee ruled in March 2016 that Askarov was arbitrarily detained, held in inhumane conditions, tortured and otherwise ill-treated without redress, and was not given a fair trial.\n\n\u201cAs long as there is a journalist in jail in Kyrgyzstan, they cannot claim to have free press and safety for journalists,\u201d Gulnoza Said, the Europe and Central Asia program coordinator at CPJ, told Polygraph.info. \u201cDespite the calls of the international community, including the U.N., Kyrgyzstan has refused to release the 68-year-old journalist, who is suffering from multiple health conditions.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
