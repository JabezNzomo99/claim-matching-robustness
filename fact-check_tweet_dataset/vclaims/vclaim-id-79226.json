A Johnson campaign email, signed by a campaign staffer, starts this way, with a reference to a statement from the day before:\n\nIn light of the Obama administration admitting Thursday that money from its reckless Iran deal would go directly to terrorism, below are five crucial moments in Senator Feingold\u2019s blind support for the deal.\n\nJohnson\u2019s assertion -- that the administration has admitted that money from the Iran nuclear deal would go directly to terrorism -- doesn\u2019t come out of thin air.\n\nBut is it air tight?\n\nThe Iran deal was made with the United States, China and three other world powers. Iran, which was within three months of getting a nuclear bomb, committed to not pursue nuclear weapons.\n\nThe deal contains other elements, but a key one is that all of the European Union and most American sanctions against Iran were lifted. Critics say that effectively amounts to a $150 billion check (though some say it\u2019s more like $100 billion) to Iran -- a reference to the amount of Iran\u2019s assets frozen in foreign banks.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Iran has more than $100 billion in available frozen assets \u2014 most of it in banks in China, Japan and South Korea \u2014 but that slightly less than half will more or less automatically go to preexisting debts. \"How the rest is spent will reveal the direction of internal power struggles between Iranian hard-liners and pragmatists,\" the article said.\n\nTo back the claim about the Obama administration and funds going directly to terrorism, the Johnson campaign email links to a January 2016 news article in The Hill about comments made by Secretary of State John Kerry.\n\nKerry had told CNBC\u2019s \"Squawk Box\" that Iran would get only $55 billion of the $150 billion referenced, saying the rest is committed to China and other countries:\n\nI think that some of it will end up in the hands of the IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps) or of other entities, some of which are labeled terrorists. To some degree, I\u2019m not going to sit here and tell you that every component of that can be prevented. But I can tell you this: Right now, we are not seeing the early delivery of funds going to that kind of endeavor at this point in time. I\u2019m sure at some point, some of it will.\n\nTo be clear, Iran is one of only three countries (Sudan and Syria are the others) that the U.S. State Department has designated as a state sponsor of terrorism.\n\nThe IRGC, as Iran\u2019s premier security institution, fields an army, navy and air force and \"presides over a vast power structure with influence over almost every aspect of Iranian life,\" according to the Council on Foreign Relations think tank. In 2007, the U.S. Treasury Department designated the IRGC\u2019s elite Quds Force a terrorist supporter for aiding the Taliban and other terrorist organizations.\n\nSo, Kerry was saying some of the money ultimately will end up with organizations involved in terrorism.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the same as funds going directly to terrorism, as Johnson claimed.\n\nKerry did tell reporters the same day, according to the Associated Press, that he understands the IRGC is \"already complaining that they are not getting the money.\"\n\nBut Kerry also said the Obama administration believes the amount of money that might flow to terrorist groups will be limited because \"the demands of Iran and of the Rouhani administration and of the supreme leader for development in their country are such that there is no way they can succeed in doing what they want to do if they are very busy funding a lot of terrorism and if they are putting money into that kind of enterprise and not into things they need to do to fund their economy.\"\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Kerry\u2019s comments weren\u2019t the first of their kind.\n\nJohnson\u2019s campaign cited to us statements made in August 2015 by senior administration officials to a U.S. Senate committee. The officials said, according to U.S. News & World Report, they were \"nearly certain\" Iran would continue funding terrorism with the tens of billions of dollars it stands to gain from the nuclear deal.\n\nThe White House did not respond to our requests for comment.\n\nJohnson said Obama's administration has admitted that money from its Iran nuclear deal \"would go directly to terrorism.\"\n\nAdministration officials have said they expect some portion of money from the deal with Iran, which is aimed at preventing Iran from getting a nuclear bomb, will end up with groups that are labeled as terrorists.\n\nFor a claim that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.", "lang": "en"}
