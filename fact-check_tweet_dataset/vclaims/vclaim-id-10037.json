This compares to a deficit of 2.3% for the UK as a whole.\n\nExcluding revenue and spending from the North Sea the Scottish deficit has been larger than the UK\u2019s as a proportion of GDP for at least the last 20 years. Including the North Sea the UK and Scottish deficits were last at the same level (7.1%) in 2011/12, but since then the UK deficit has become smaller, while the Scottish deficit has stayed broadly the same.\n\nIn monetary terms Scotland had a deficit of around \u00a313 billion in 2016/17. That\u2019s whether or not revenue and spending from the North Sea is included. The UK deficit was larger, at \u00a346 billion.", "lang": "en"}
