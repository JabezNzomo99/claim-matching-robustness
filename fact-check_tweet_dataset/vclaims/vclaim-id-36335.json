The bill would also allow immigration judges to decline, on humanitarian grounds, to issue a deportation order for an immigrant who has a criminal conviction.\n\nIn February 2020 readers asked us about an opinion column written by Fox News host Tucker Carlson, which claimed that a new bill proposed by U.S. House Democrats would, if passed in its current form, protect immigrants from deportation even if they commit crimes.\n\nThe op-ed, published on Feb. 7, bore the headline \u201cCriminals Would Be Protected From Deportation Under Bill AOC and Other House Democrats Back.\u201d The piece included the following:\n\nUnder current U.S. law, legal U.S. immigrants can be deported if they commit an \u201caggravated felony\u201d or a \u201ccrime of moral turpitude\u201d \u2013 that is, a vile, depraved act, like molesting a child. Under the New Way Forward Act, \u201ccrimes of moral turpitude\u201d are eliminated entirely as a justification for deportation. And the category of \u201caggravated felony\u201d gets circumscribed too. What does that mean? Consider this: Under current law, immigrants who commit serious crimes \u2013 such as robbery, fraud, or child sexual abuse \u2013 must be deported, regardless of the sentence they receive. Other crimes \u2013 less severe ones like racketeering \u2013 require deportation as long as the perpetrator receives at least a one-year sentence. But if this bill passes the House and Senate and is signed into law by the president, there will no longer be any crimes that automatically require deportation. None. And one crime \u2013 falsifying a passport \u2013 will be made immune from deportation, no matter what. Because apparently 9/11 never happened, and we no longer care about fake government documents \u2026 Under the proposed legislation, the minimum prison sentence for crimes that still require deportation would rise from one year to five\u2026 The bill would grant sweeping new powers to immigration judges, allowing them to nullify a deportation order.\n\nCarlson\u2019s op-ed, and a subsequent segment on his Fox News show, featured numerous specific claims about the legislation, but the one that drew the most inquiries from Snopes readers was the same one Fox News included in its headline \u2014 that the New Way Forward Act would \u201cprotect criminals from deportation.\u201d As a result, that claim is the focus of this particular fact check.\n\nIf it were signed into law and implemented, the New Way Forward Act would bring about a number of changes to U.S. federal law on deportations. The following is a summary of those changes, as found in the version of the legislation published in December 2019 (the most up-to-date version at the time of Carlson\u2019s article and at the time of this fact check):\n\u2022 Removes crimes of moral turpitude and crimes carrying a sentence of at least one year as a grounds for deportation (deportable offenses)\n\u2022 Stipulates that \u201caggravated felonies\u201d such as murder, rape, child sexual abuse and drug trafficking must have carried a sentence of at least five years in order to qualify as deportable offenses\n\u2022 Redefines an aggravated felony \u2014 which includes theft, racketeering, bribery, obstruction of justice and certain crimes of violence \u2014 so that only offenses which carry a sentence of at least five years would be labelled as aggravated felonies and thereby liable to form the basis of a deportation order\n\u2022 Removes the forging of a passport as a deportable offense\n\u2022 Changes the definition of \u201cconviction\u201d to exclude cases where a criminal conviction has been overturned, expunged, vacated, and so on, cases where only probation has been ordered, and cases where a judgement of guilt is currently under appeal.\n\u2022 Stipulates that the sentence imposed in a given conviction can only be regarded as including the period of the sentence to be served, and cannot include suspended portions of sentences\n\u2022 Stipulates that only an aggravated felony that came with a sentence of at least five years can be treated as a \u201cparticularly serious crime,\u201d thereby entitling the U.S. Attorney General to reject any asylum application filed by the offender in question.\n\nAnother section of the New Way Forward Act would give immigration judges significant new discretionary powers in deciding whether to issue a deportation order. Under existing law, judges are only allowed to consider \u201cthe evidence produced at the hearing,\u201d before making their determination. Under the proposed legislation, judges would be able to weigh that evidence, including the existence of prior deportable offenses, against other factors.\n\nThis means that even if an immigrant has been convicted of a deportable criminal offense, an immigration judge could, under the bill, decline to order their deportation \u201cin pursuit of humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public interest.\u201d\n\nClearly, the provisions of the New Way Forward Act would make it more difficult to deport immigrants who have committed certain crimes, most notably the removal of lower-level drug crimes as a deportable offense, and the proposed requirement that aggravated felonies be redefined as carrying at least a five-year prison sentence in order to form the basis of a deportation order.\n\nGiving immigration judges the ability to exercise discretion and decline to order a deportation for humanitarian reasons is also likely to lower the deportation rate by a certain degree, though it should be noted that the legislation would not impose any legal requirement on judges to be more lenient in their decisions.\n\nThe headline of the article \u2014 \u201cCriminals Would Be Protected From Deportation Under Bill AOC and Other House Democrats Back\u201d \u2014 risked giving some readers the mistaken impression that the New Way Forward Act would entirely protect immigrants who have violated U.S. criminal law from being deported. That would not be the case \u2014 such offenders could and undoubtedly would continue to be deported under the proposed legislation.\n\nRather, the bill would mean certain offenses could no longer form the sole basis of a deportation order, and the sentencing threshold for \u201caggravated felonies\u201d would be increased from one year to five years, thereby enhancing the protections against deportation available to immigrants who were convicted of such crimes and sentenced to between one and five years in prison. The body of Carlson\u2019s article outlined those facts with greater nuance than the headline did.", "lang": "en"}
