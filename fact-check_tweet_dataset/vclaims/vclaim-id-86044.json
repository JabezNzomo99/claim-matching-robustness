In the hard-fought North Carolina Senate race, just about every ad from a Democratic outside organization repeats the same talking point \u2014that the GOP candidate, Thom Tillis, as speaker of the North Carolina House, presided over a $500 million cut in education funding. Tillis\u2019s opponent, Sen. Kay Hagan (D), also raised it in a political debate.\n\nIn June, we first looked at this issue, when yet another outside group, Emily\u2019s List, ran a similar attack ad. The Emily\u2019s List ad, as well as two of these new ads, pair the $500 million allegation with the bogus claim that Tillis handed out tax cuts for \u201cprivate jets and yachts.\u201d\n\nAs we have said before, the jet and yacht claim is taken out of context. A major tax law negotiated under Tillis\u2019s watch in 2013 eliminated a number of loopholes to help finance a tax cut, including a $20,000 cap on deducting property taxes and home mortgage interest that was aimed at the owners of large homes and estates. But lawmakers, under pressure from the state\u2019s boat building industry, did not eliminate a $1,500 cap on the sales tax for boats and planes.\n\nAs for the $500 million figure, close observers will note that every single ad attributes this figure to the same source \u2014 an editorial in Charlotte Observer that ran in 2013. \u201cThe Senate and House budget plan \u2026 cuts education spending by almost $500 million in the next two years, including a decrease in net spending for K-12 public schools,\u201d the editorial said.\n\nThat\u2019s right, this is a two-year number \u2014 and the second year is adjusted as circumstances warrant. Moreover, the $500 million figure is comparing the figures over two years against a \u201ccontinuation budget\u201d \u2014 what would be needed to maintain the same level of spending based on inflation, population growth and other factors. In Washington parlance, this is known as \u201cthe baseline.\u201d It\u2019s an important concept, but it is simply an illustration; it not does not reflect actual budget numbers.\n\nOn top of that, as the editorial acknowledged, this is a figure for all education spending. Only $117 million of these baseline reductions occurred in K-12 education in 2013-2014; the other cuts were in community colleges and university education. That amounts to a decrease of just 1.5 percent of the K-12 education budget.\n\nIn the most recent legislative session, lawmakers adjusted education spending to give it a $113 million boost, including about $59 million for K-12 education. That\u2019s an increase of about \u00be of one percent from the enacted budget for K-12 education. The latest budget also includes a big boost in teacher salaries and benefits, though Democrats claim it was accomplished through budget gimmicks.\n\nPhilip Price, chief financial officer of the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, said that this continues a trend since 2009 in which salaries and benefits have been boosted, while funding for classroom services have decreased. The number of students in public schools has increased by 44,000, or nearly 3 percent, but he said the education budget has not quite kept pace.\n\nThat mismatch of better pay and benefits for educators and lower spending for classrooms, he said, has meant that since 2009, funding for textbooks has declined 78 percent, instructional supplies fell 51 percent, the number of teacher assistants dropped 23 percent and the number of classroom teachers declined 3.5 percent.\n\nIn other words, lawmakers have decided to alter the mix of education funding by increasing teacher pay and benefits while reducing classroom services. So there is some room for complaints about the legislature\u2019s priorities, but that\u2019s an entirely different matter than claiming \u201c$500 million\u201d in cuts.\n\nBut voters should be wary of raw numbers without proper context. This is not a real budget number but one based off a baseline. The ads all feature children, but this is a number for all education funding, not just K-12. Moreover, funding was increased \u2014 and teachers got a pay raise \u2014 in this summer\u2019s budget, but the ads still cite the old 2013 baseline figure.", "lang": "en"}
