When we moved into the White House, we had the lowest net worth of any family since Harry Truman.\"\n\nSo, did Bill do better by isolating on presidents since Harry Truman?\n\nThe answer is yes.\n\nDetailed financial disclosures were not required for presidents through the 1970s, so we\u2019re left to rely on other resources to get a picture of a commander-in-chief\u2019s financial assets, said Paul Brace, a professor of political science at Rice University.\n\nStill, we do know a lot about their lives. Let\u2019s start with Truman since he\u2019s critical.\n\nTruman and his wife Bess were not homeowners when he became president. They rented a Washington apartment, and Bess\u2019 mother, who owned the Independence, Mo., home associated with Harry Truman, shared a room with their daughter Margaret, said Alonzo Hamby, a Truman biographer and Ohio University emeritus professor of history.\n\nTruman\u2019s journey to public office followed bankruptcy-dodging and a failed haberdashery business in the 1920s. He worked his way up from county judge to a U.S. senator, vice president and president upon Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s death in 1945. Even when he was earning $10,000 as a senator in 1935 ($171,000 in 2015 dollars), he could not save the family farm his mother owned.\n\nIt was Truman\u2019s post-White House flirtation with bankruptcy that inspired Congress to pass presidential pensions, said Aaron Crawford, a post-doctoral student at Southern Methodist University.\n\nExperts can\u2019t pinpoint his net worth to a specific dollar figure, but all the evidence points to the number being quite low. Joseph J. Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project at Tax Analysts, using tax returns released by his presidential library.\n\nThe man from Hope, and his pre-White House wallet\n\nThe Clintons are certainly unique compared to other first families in modern history for a couple big reasons: They did not inherit sizable family estates, and Hillary Clinton was the family breadwinner as Bill worked as a career politician.\n\nBefore running for the White House in 1992, Clinton brought in $35,000 a year as Arkansas governor, plus some speaking fees, honorariums and in-kind income, such as living in the governor\u2019s residence. Hillary was a senior partner in the of Little Rock at the time, earned $92,000 salary and listed her share of her law firm\u2019s profit-sharing and retirement plan between $100,001 and $250,000, according to a New York Times of the couple\u2019s finances in 1992.\n\nThe Clintons listed their net worth as nearly $700,000 in a 1992 statement, a substantial hike from the $418,692 net worth reported at the end of the 1989, according to the Washington Post.\n\nLest you worry about the financial wealth of the Clintons, the family was still well off by most any standard. The median household net worth for Americans in 2013 was $81,200 (see page 12), according to the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe experts we contacted didn\u2019t rattle off hard numbers as they dissected various presidents\u2019 pre-office net worth. Instead, they ruled out the obviously wealthy presidents based on their jobs and family situations. (Truman biographer Hamby used the phrases, \"JFK of course was quite rich,\" \"Reagan was at least quite affluent,\" and \"George H.W. Bush was at least wealthy if not filthy rich.\")\n\nEliminating the obvious, experts focused on who might present Clinton with a realistic challenge.\n\nRichard Nixon? He had a pretty lucrative law practice in New York. Lyndon B. Johnson? Journalists and historians disagree on exactly how he built his wealth, experts said, but he at least married a wealthy woman whose father owned Texas radio stations.\n\nDwight D. Eisenhower? Nah, they said, as he was doing well for himself after World War II, landing on corporate boards and enjoying a good military pension and sales of his memoir, Crusade in Europe. \"You save the world, you get good royalties,\" said Jeffrey Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University.\n\nMost encouraged us to give presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford a closer look.\n\nCarter had earned a good living as the owner of a peanut warehouse business in Georgia before running for the state Senate in 1962, said Scott Kaufman, a scholar of Ford and Carter at Francis Marion University.\n\nIn 1979\u2019s Jimmy Carter: A Character Portrait, authors Bruce Mazlish and Edwin Diamond wrote that Carter\u2019s fortune was $814,000 when he became president, Kaufman said. That bests Clinton, without even having to break out the inflation calculator.\n\nA separate source \u2014 a 1976 Washington Post sent over by the Hillary Clinton campaign \u2014 showed Carter had a net worth (when valuing assets at their original cost) of $512,000, which translates to $1.3 million in 1992 dollars, according to 1975 tax returns he released during his campaign against Ford.\n\nA document from the Gerald R. Ford presidential library suggests Ford had a more modest net worth compared to other presidents. , dated Oct. 29, 1973, (the year before Ford became president), showed a net worth of $256,378, which had the same buying power as about $810,000 in 1992. That\u2019s more than the Clintons, though not by much.\n\nFord\u2019s finances and dealings were part of the most intense background checks for anyone ever screened for the vice presidency, Kaufman said, coming off the resignation of Nixon vice president Spiro Agnew earlier that month and amid looming worries about legal implications for Nixon in the Watergate scandal.\n\n\"They didn\u2019t want to appoint someone who might also have problems,\" Kaufman said.\n\nBill Clinton urged Americans to remember the Clintons\u2019 more modest beginnings with his family\u2019s fattened finances in the limelight, saying, \"When we moved into the White House, we had the lowest net worth of any family since Harry Truman.\"\n\nYou can decide whether his point is relevant, but Clinton has improved the accuracy of his factoid since making a similar claim last year.\n\nWe could not find evidence of a president after Truman whose inflation-adjusted net worth was smaller than the Clintons\u2019.", "lang": "en"}
