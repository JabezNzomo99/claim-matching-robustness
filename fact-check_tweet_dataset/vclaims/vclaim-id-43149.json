The claim originated in a satirical article.\n\nRogers passed away at his home in Sandy Springs, Georgia, on March 2o. A representative, Keith Hagan, told The Associated Press that he died of natural causes. Rogers was 81.\n\nThe award-winning singer had an estimated net worth of $250 million, and the post claims that his wife has already revealed what will be done with a significant portion of it.

In a 2015 interview with The Guardian, he said, \u201cI really like him. I think his problem is that he says what everyone wants to hear, but doesn\u2019t say it well. I love what he says, I have to admit.\u201d There is, however, no evidence part of Rogers\u2019 estate will go Trump\u2019s reelection bid.\n\nHad his wife done so, it would have been picked up by the media, yet no outlets have reported on it. The family did not mention anything to that effect in its statement to the media, nor has the Trump campaign put out a statement.\n\nRogers\u2019 wife is named Wanda. The Daily Caller only found Tubolls mentioned online in association with the story featured in the Facebook post.\n\nRumors that she plans to donate some of Rogers\u2019 estate to Trump\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign likely stem from an article published on the satire website Tatersgonnatate.com. That article includes a photo of Rogers and his wife but erroneously refers to her as Tubolls.", "lang": "en"}
