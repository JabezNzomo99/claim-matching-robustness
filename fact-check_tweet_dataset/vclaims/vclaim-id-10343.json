Text accompanying the post implied that the photo was of a six-year old Hindu girl allegedly raped by 27-year old Muslim \u2013 Meraz Miyan in Kargahar area of Rohtas district of Bihar.\n\nWhile the police confirmed details of the crime they denied that the image being shared on social media was that of the survivor. BOOM did a Google Reverse Image Search of the photo which did not yield any results. However, we have reason to believe it is not the same girl, as the child shown in the photo appears to look much younger than six and does not appear to be alive.\n\nThe photo has been used by the website Hindu Post and was shared on Twitter by the handle True Indology. BOOM has further blurred and blackened out the photo out of respect for the victim.", "lang": "en"}
