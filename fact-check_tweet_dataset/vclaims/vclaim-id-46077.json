The recording adds that these people could end up dying at home.\n\nIt also claims every mortuary in the UK is full and we're now \"sending bodies to every ice skating rink there is in the UK\".\n\nIt also says that \u201cas of next week\u201d (again the exact week being referred to is unclear) the government will be announcing that no daily exercise outside will be allowed and that street marshals will be deployed to check people have the correct passes to be allowed outside to get medicines and essential food only.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of a voice message being shared currently on social media regarding the ambulance response to coronavirus. The alarmist information being shared in the message is not correct. We would urge people to disregard the message and not share it further.\n\n\u201cIn line with our ongoing plans during this challenging time, we are continuing to follow national guidelines regarding the ambulance response and thank the public for their ongoing support in following the government\u2019s advice.\u201d\n\nPHE also put out a statement saying they were \u201caware of a voice message circulating about the ambulance response to coronavirus, as well as restrictions on movement and predicted case numbers, which claims to have come from PHE.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is fake news, and we would urge people to ignore the message and not share it further.\u201d\n\nPHE has issued guidance for ambulance trusts which includes information on wearing protective equipment, how to determine if a patient requires transport to hospital, and how that handover should be carried out. None of the claims made in the recording appear in this guidance.\n\nIf you received this viral recording on WhatsApp, or if you receive any like it in future there are ways you can check the information to see if it is trustworthy. We produced a guide on how to fact check claims about the coronavirus pandemic.", "lang": "en"}
