Acevedo conceded that fact in an email and then a phone conversation with The Fact Checker, but he argued that critics were cherry-picking a line from his comments to distract from the stalled gun-control debate in Congress.\n\nFederal law bans people from having guns if they were convicted of domestic violence and the victim was a spouse, former spouse or a person with whom they lived or shared a child. What about a boyfriend? The House bill would expand the gun ban to include anyone who was a \u201cdating partner\u201d or former dating partner. In other words, it would close the boyfriend loophole.\n\n\u201cThe officer did not have his weapon out, did not shoot at the defendant,\u201d according to John Brewer, one of the prosecutors handling the case for the Harris County district attorney\u2019s office. \u201cAt that time, the defendant pulled his gun and emptied his gun at or into the victim.\u201d\n\nIn remarks to reporters before escorting Brewster\u2019s body to a funeral home, Acevedo said: \u201cWe all know in law enforcement that one of the biggest reasons that the Senate and Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn and Ted Cruz and others are not getting into a room, and having a conference committee with the House and getting the Violence Against Women Act, is because the NRA doesn\u2019t like the fact that we want to take firearms out of the hands of boyfriends that abuse their girlfriends. And who killed our sergeant? A boyfriend abusing his girlfriend.\u201d\n\nWe asked whether authorities had determined how Solis obtained the firearms but did not get a response from the Houston Police Department. Solis\u2019s defense lawyers say he has a history of mental illness. That would also disqualify him from having guns under current law. According to local media reports, Solis\u2019s father said his son armed himself after burglars broke into his home.\n\nThe day after his comments about Republican senators, Acevedo said: \u201cMy emotions got the best of me yesterday, you know, I\u2019m not sure that maybe it was the time, but I had a lot of anger and that anger is still here. \u2026 If you can\u2019t figure out why I\u2019m pissed, shame on you. A 32-year-old man should not be dead, and it\u2019s not just him, it\u2019s every day in this country.\u201d (A Houston reporter noted that Acevedo at this news conference did not apologize for the substance of his earlier remarks, only the timing.)\n\nAcevedo added that he never specifically claimed the boyfriend loophole contributed to the officer\u2019s death \u2014 but he conceded his remarks could be interpreted that way. Acevedo then argued that \u201cCornyn and Cruz\u201d were focusing on one line from his comments to distract from the debate over the Violence Against Women Act and the boyfriend loophole.\n\n\u201cThe reason I brought up Sergeant Brewster and the fact he was murdered by a man who beat his girlfriend is to illustrate how violent these men are and why we need to get the boyfriend loophole closed,\u201d Acevedo said. \u201cWe need to do everything we can to keep firearms in the hands of law-abiding Americans of sound mind, and elected officials need to do the same.\u201d\n\nBut, when we reached out, Acevedo conceded that the suspected shooter was legally barred from possessing firearms because of a prior family violence conviction from 2015. The police chief also acknowledged that he didn\u2019t have all the information when he made his comments about Republican senators on Dec. 9. So we will withhold Pinocchios for Acevedo.", "lang": "en"}
