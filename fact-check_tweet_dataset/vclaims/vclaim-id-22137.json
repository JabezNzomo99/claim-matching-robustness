And in January 2018, Bezos\u2019 company opened the first \u201cAmazon Go\u201d \u2014 a new kind of store with no checkout required \u2014 in Seattle, Washington, to considerable fanfare:\n\nAmid a wave of increased press coverage and scrutiny, a viral meme made a number number of claims about Amazon in January 2018:\n\nA spokesperson for Amazon confirmed the fact that the company\u2019s new grocery store, Amazon Go, does not accept SNAP benefits or food stamps as a form of payment.\n\nThe source of the claim about Amazon workers receiving food stamps was a January 2018 report by the nonprofit group PolicyMatters Ohio, which estimated that roughly 700 Amazon workers in Ohio (more than 10 percent of the company\u2019s employees in the state) receive Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program benefits:\n\nPolicyMatters Ohio arrived at that estimate by finding the number of Ohio food stamp recipients who are part of a household where someone works for Amazon (1,430), then dividing that by 2.02 (the average size of a household on food stamps in Ohio at that time). The resulting estimate is about 700 workers, or 11.8 of Amazon\u2019s Ohio workforce. We were unable to find any research or data on Amazon workers\u2019 availing themselves of food stamps in other states.\n\nPolicyMatters Ohio sent us figures to corroborate their claims, which they received from the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. (That data is available for download in spreadsheet form here.) Further, whether or not an individual qualifies for food stamps is determined by more than just income. Having a gross monthly household income at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty limit is an important factor. However, you can also qualify for SNAP benefits with an income above the poverty limit if someone in your household is disabled or elderly, and the poverty limit is pro-rated depending on the size of your household.\n\nAnother factor to consider is whether a worker is employed by Amazon on a full-time or part-time basis. Someone whose only source of income was their part-time job at an Amazon fulfillment center would earn a lower monthly income than a full-time worker in a similar position, even if they received the same hourly wage.\n\nThis circumstance might well qualify someone for food stamps even if their hourly wage at Amazon were otherwise not too bad. In an email, an Amazon spokesperson told us that \u201cAmazon full-time hourly employees in Ohio earn between $14.50 and $15 an hour as a starting wage with regular pay increases plus Amazon stock and performance based bonuses.\u201d\n\nOn 1 February 2018, Amazon\u2019s jobs web site listed seven open warehouse positions in Ohio. Only one was full-time, a description which a company spokesperson told us entails 40 hours of work per week. The hourly wage for the part-time jobs ranged from $10.50 to $11.75, while a \u201creduced time\u201d position came with a starting rate of between $14.50 and $17 an hour. The full-time position had a starting hourly wage of between $14.50 and $15.\n\nAccording to a major 2016 report by the non-profit Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a group that advocates for more sustainable community development, Amazon\u2019s warehouse workers across 11 metropolitan areas in the United States earned, on average, 15 percent lower than could be expected for a worker in that industry (page 39).\n\nAmazon told us this analysis was \u201cflawed,\u201d because it compared Amazon wages with \u201ctraditional warehouse jobs and compensation,\u201d claiming that the appropriate comparison would be between Amazon wages and retail wages, because \u201cthat industry more closely resembles the environment of an Amazon fulfillment center.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the report\u2019s authors said it was difficult to ascertain exactly what proportion of warehouse workers were on permanent contracts, and what proportion were temps, but estimated (based on news reports and the industry average) that the permanent to temporary ratio was roughly 60/40.\n\nA spokesperson for the company gave contradictory figures, saying: \u201cThroughout the year on average, 90 percent of associates across the company\u2019s U.S. fulfillment network are regular, full-time employees. That applies for states like Ohio.\u201d The spokesperson confirmed that \u201cregular\u201d means permanent. The ILSR criticized Amazon for using the label \u201cseasonal\u201d \u2014 which has connotations of the annual retail holiday rush \u2014 to describe the temporary positions it fills year-round.\n\nAmazon has also previously come under fire for what have been described as difficult working conditions. In its 2016 report, the ILSR summarized employment at the company\u2019s fulfillment centers as \u201cgrueling work for lower pay than average\u201d:\n\nIn response to these descriptions, a spokesperson for the company told us:\n\nWhile the meme says that Amazon grossed $128 billion in sales \u201clast year,\u201d that number is not quite accurate. For one thing, Amazon\u2019s 2017 earnings had not yet been published in January 2018, when the meme was created. Instead, Grit Post, where the meme appears to have originated, said in a list of sources that they had used Amazon\u2019s 2016 numbers. Amazon actually had net (not gross) sales of $136 billion in 2016, according to the company\u2019s full year financial results. This means gross sales (which were not reported) were even higher than that, and certainly higher than the $128 billion claimed in the meme.\n\nAmazon\u2019s sales for 2017 are likely to be astronomical. Based on the company\u2019s predictions for the final three months of the year, Amazon\u2019s full-year net sales in 2017 might reach around $178 billion.", "lang": "en"}
