The government\u2019s introduction of the National Living Wage is part of the reason why, but there\u2019s a lot more to inequality trends than changes in earnings alone.\n\nIncome inequality has fallen on some measures in recent years, although these trends are expected to reverse.\n\nThe National Living Wage has boosted earnings for some\n\nThe National Living Wage is the legally binding hourly rate for workers aged 25 and over. It came into force in 2016 and is currently set at \u00a37.50 an hour. It\u2019s different from the National Minimum Wage, which is lower and applies at different rates to people aged under 25.\n\nThis has contributed towards higher weekly earnings for people on lower incomes. Between 2013 and 2016, people on lower incomes saw much stronger earnings growth than people at the top, thanks to rises in the Minimum Wage and the introduction of the National Living Wage, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility.\n\nSimilarly, people on the Minimum and National Living Wage have seen stronger earnings growth after inflation than those with the middle and highest earnings earnings since about 2007. That\u2019s according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).\n\nBut this alone isn\u2019t a magic bullet for reducing inequality\n\nMr Gauke goes on to connect the pay rises to reduced inequality, but there are two reasons we need to be cautious about this.\n\nFirstly, the National Living Wage doesn\u2019t benefit people at the very bottom as much as those in the middle. That\u2019s because people at the lower end of the scale have more of their income made up by benefits. \u201cThe households gaining from the new [National Living Wage] are more evenly distributed across the income distribution, with the largest gains in the middle\u201d, says the IFS.\n\nSecondly, wage changes alone miss the bigger picture. Changes to taxes and benefits introduced by the government are set to affect people on the lowest incomes hardest, and this more than offsets the gains some workers get from increased pay as a result of the National Living Wage.\n\nInequality has been falling by some measures, but these trends are expected to reverse\n\nNo single measure can sum up what\u2019s been happening to inequality in the UK in recent years. But we can get an idea by looking at a few examples.\n\nHousehold incomes generally rose faster for those on lower incomes than those towards the top between 2007/08 and 2014/15. The IFS says this is because the recession in the late 2000s hit incomes hard, and households at the top were most affected by this as earnings make up a larger portion of their income. In addition, benefits tended to rise in real terms during this period so this benefited poorer households.\n\nThis trend is expected to reverse over the next few years\u2014up to 2021/22\u2014with lower-income households seeing smaller rises or even falls in their incomes after inflation. This is expected because of reductions to working-age benefits, along with expected rises in earnings\u2014which again will tend to benefit higher income households.", "lang": "en"}
