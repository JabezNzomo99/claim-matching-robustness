DesCartes says that on July 8 2011, he went to do his job as normal, but when he found Barack Obama he wasn\u2019t alone. \u201cHe was naked with another man, a White House intern, in the Reagan Bedroom,\u201d DesCartes says. \u201cThe President was bent over a dresser and the intern was, well, you can guess what was happening.
