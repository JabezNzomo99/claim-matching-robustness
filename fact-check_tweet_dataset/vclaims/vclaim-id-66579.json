Martin O\u2019Malley.\n\nIn his presidential campaign on May 30, 2015, O\u2019Malley attacked Bush and Clinton for their supposed mutual backer, Goldman Sachs, the poster child of big, bad Wall Street.\n\n\"Recently, the CEO of Goldman Sachs let his employees know that he\u2019d be just fine with either Bush or Clinton,\" O\u2019Malley said. \"Well, I\u2019ve got news for the bullies of Wall Street: The presidency is not a crown to be passed back and forth by you between two royal families.\"\n\nWe were curious about O\u2019Malley\u2019s claim on whether Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein would sign off on both the presumed Republican and Democratic frontrunners, especially in front of the firm's 34,400 employees. Goldman Sachs spokesperson Andrew Williams told us, \"We\u2019ve looked high and low and found no such statement by Mr. Blankfein.\"\n\nOne side of the aisle is clear: Blankfein has fundraised for Clinton. It\u2019s actually his support for Bush where the evidence in lacking.\n\nAn O\u2019Malley spokesperson pointed us to an article published in March 2015 in Politico magazine. In it, economic reporter Ben White detailed Blankfein\u2019s close relationship with the Clintons and wrote,\"Blankfein has indicated he would be fine with either a Bush or Clinton presidency.\"\n\nWhite told us in an email that to his knowledge, Blankfein has never stated this publicly, though he\u2019s suggested it privately, according to anonymous sources close to the CEO.\n\nHis long-time support for Clinton, however, is out in the open. Blankfein, a self-described Democrat, personally $4,600 to her last presidential campaign (and thousands to past Democratic presidential candidates). He told \"I very much was supportive of Hillary Clinton the last go-round,\" he said. \"I held fundraisers for her.\"\n\nPast comments from the Goldman executive do indicate some political fluidity. In 2013, Blankfein said he likes both Hillary Clinton and Chris Christie, \"people who are moderated and see the other side,\" .\n\nThat\u2019s the attitude on Wall Street in general, experts say. Goldman and its peers tend to play the middle, said economic historian and former banker Charles Geisst. Centrists like Clinton or Bush would maintain the financial status quo, while candidates like Bernie Sanders or Ted Cruz, \"people on the fringes, make them nervous,\" said journalist William Cohan, who wrote a book on the firm. And even if Blankfein personally favors Clinton, he and Wall Street are in it to win it.\n\n\"It\u2019s about access, access, access...Goldman wants to back the winner. They\u2019re traders who\u2019ll hedge their bets,\" said Cohan.\n\nAs for Goldman and Wall Street\u2019s opinion of Martin O\u2019Malley? \"I suspect anyone to the right of Elizabeth Warren or Sanders would get the same sort of hedged support,\" said Geisst.\n\nO\u2019Malley said, \"The CEO of Goldman Sachs let his employees know that he\u2019d be just fine with either Bush or Clinton.\"\n\nThe O\u2019Malley campaign referred us a Politico article that stated a much more ambiguous version of the claim. The article\u2019s author told us CEO Lloyd Blankfein has never stated this publicly, much less to the company's 34,400 employees. Blankfein has thrown his weight and money behind Clinton publicly, but he hasn't done the same for Bush. Overall, we rate O\u2019Malley\u2019s claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
