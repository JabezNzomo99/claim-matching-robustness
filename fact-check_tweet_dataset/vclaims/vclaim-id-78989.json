For example, Fox News anchorman on Aug. 8 that President Obama \"personally intervened to make sure that members of Congress and their staffers will not have to live with Obamacare.\"\n\nThe on Aug. 5 that the politicians had moved \"to create a special exemption for themselves from the Obamacare health coverage that everybody else is mandated to buy.\"\n\nYet when U.S. Rep. James Langevin, a Democrat representing Rhode Island\u2019s Second Congressional District, was interviewed Aug. 12, 2013, by WPRO's Gene Valicenti, Langevin said flatly that he's now going to have to buy his health insurance from the \"exchanges\" that serve as online marketplaces for health care policies.\n\n\"Obamacare, as you mentioned, is going to be in effect very soon. We've seen some very positive effects,\" he said, citing the elimination of lifetime caps and the ban on insurance companies denying coverage because of a preexisting condition. \"And people will very soon be choosing their health care through the health insurance exchanges, including members of Congress.\"\n\n\"I\u2019ll be choosing my health care plan from the new exchange that Rhode Island is setting up,\" Langevin said. (Rhode Island\u2019s exchange, HealthSource RI, for plans that take effect in 2014.)\n\nSo who is correct here? We decided to check Langevin's statement that members of Congress will have to buy from an exchange, sometimes referred to as a health insurance marketplace.\n\nHere's the short answer: members of Congress are treated differently under the law, but not in the way critics of Obamacare say. Here\u2019s why.\n\n, people must either get health insurance coverage or pay a fine, beginning Jan. 1, 2014.\n\nGenerally, workers and their dependents who are covered by an employer's health insurance are all set. More than half the population is already covered that way. (Beginning in 2015, companies employing 50 or more must offer coverage or pay a penalty.)\n\nThe exchanges -- set up by individual states or the federal government (if a state doesn't want to operate one) -- are designed to offer one-stop shopping for small businesses seeking affordable plans for their workers and for people without insurance looking to buy a policy.\n\nBecause members of Congress and their staffs are already covered by that cover other federal employees, they wouldn\u2019t have needed to buy their insurance through an exchange.\n\nBut when Obamacare was being debated, some argued that Congress and congressional staff members should be required to buy their insurance through an exchange system, saying that would ensure that the system would work properly. If ordinary citizens would have to use the exchange, the argument went, so should Congress.\n\nThat provision ultimately became part of Obamacare, formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In passing it, members of Congress made themselves and their staffers exempt from the provision of the law that would have let them stay with their existing health plan, like everyone else already covered by an employer's health insurance plan.\n\nBut that opened up a different issue, and it revolves around paying for their insurance.\n\nMost individuals who buy their coverage on the exchange will have to pay for it out of their own pocket. Many will get help from a federal subsidy in the form of a tax credit that .\n\nYet members of Congress, and some of their staff, make too much money to quality for any subsidy.\n\nSo they would have to pay twice. Not only would they lose (in this case, the \"company\" is the federal government), they would have to pay for their new insurance plan entirely out of their own pocket.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the Obama administration , that the money already being spent to pay for Congress\u2019 current health insurance plan to any policy purchased from an exchange.\n\nIt was this proposed rule that prompted critics over the past few weeks to allege that the Obama administration was creating another exemption for Congress members and their staffs.\n\nBut Congress had already agreed to live by the system it created. What the new rule actually does is continue the federal government\u2019s contribution toward its employees\u2019 insurance coverage.\n\nSo when U.S. Rep. James Langevin said he would be required to buy his health insurance through one of the Obamacare exchanges, his statement was .", "lang": "en"}
