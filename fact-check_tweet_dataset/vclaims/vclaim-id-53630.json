For example it combines payments that go to individuals (like public sector salaries) and payments that can go to couples (like Universal Credit), but still counts these as individual people. \n\n\n\nAlso it assumes that all unemployed people before the crisis started received benefits which isn\u2019t necessarily the case. It also won\u2019t necessarily include all people who aren\u2019t technically unemployed but who receive support, such as through disability payments.\n\nThe Express reported this as 27 million adults who \u201creceive state help\u201d, which is potentially misleading. It implies all of these people are receiving benefits of some kind, when at least five million of it is just public sector workers earning their normal salaries.\n\nWho is \u201cpaid by the state\u201d can be counted in lots of ways\n\nPutting everything else aside, there\u2019s the question as to who you count as being \u201cpaid by the state\u201d which is difficult to answer, because there are lots of different ways you could define it.\n\nThe Telegraph includes people who are receiving certain types of benefits, but you could include people who are receiving any kind of state benefit, or just those who receive most or all their income from state benefits.\n\nPensioners, for example, might also argue that they paid in National Insurance, and so their state pension is no more being paid \u201cby the state\u201d than their private pension is being paid \u201cby Aviva.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also not straightforward to count public sector workers. If you start including workers directly employed by the state (as the Telegraph did), then why not include those who work for companies paid by public contracts? Is a cleaner employed by a building management company in the Department for Education being \u201cpaid by the state\u201d?\n\nSo this sort of calculation basically becomes an exercise of picking and choosing what you want to count, with the end result not necessarily all that meaningful to anyone. And even if you could agree on the definition, the figures aren\u2019t always readily available to do the sums.\n\nAs mentioned, some figures are available for family units, some for individuals, and it's hard to disentangle people who might count as being \u201cpaid by the state in different ways\u201d (such as someone over-65 who receives a state pension but is still working and has been furloughed). In other words, someone who\u2019s counted among the 12.6 million pension claimants may also count in some of the other categories.\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps more helpful to look at how particular groups have changed under lockdown\n\nTaking just employees, for example, we know that 5.4 million people worked in the public sector at the end of last year. 6.3 million jobs have been furloughed since the lockdown began, according to HMRC, as part of the government\u2019s Job Retention Scheme. These will predominantly be private sector workers, as public organisations are not expected to furlough workers and are given guidance accordingly.\n\nSo while not a perfect comparison, it would have been more meaningful to say the number of employees paid predominantly by the state had roughly doubled since the lockdown began. Since the Telegraph\u2019s calculation, the number of furloughed workers is even higher.\n\nThere\u2019s also been a surge in claims for Universal Credit. In February 2020, before the lockdown began, about 2.9 million people were claiming Universal Credit. The government announced on 6 May that around 1.8 million claims had been made to the benefit since the lockdown was announced in mid-March.\n\nThis still doesn\u2019t tell us to what extent different households are dependent on these benefits for their income. \n\n\n\nBefore the lockdown, a majority of UK families received some kind of state support. In 2018/19, 51% of families (\u201cbenefit units\u201d) in the UK received some kind of benefit or tax credit from the state\u2014pensions and Child Benefit were the most widely claimed. (This doesn\u2019t include people employed by the state.)\n\nMost families receive a relatively small amount of support. If you just look at families who got at least \u00a310,000 a year from the state, the proportion falls to 22% .\n\n\n\nAs the Institute for Fiscal Studies pointed out last year, about 1.8 million working-age households (8.5% of all such households) rely on benefits for at least 80% of their income, although over the longer term, many more households will rely on the state at some point, for example after people become parents.\n\nWe won\u2019t know how figures like these have changed since the lockdown began for some time yet.", "lang": "en"}
