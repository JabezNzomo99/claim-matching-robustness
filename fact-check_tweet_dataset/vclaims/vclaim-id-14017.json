It\u2019s had over 35,000 shares on Facebook.\n\nSome of the numbers are not quite right, but all the trends are broadly correct. Below we\u2019ve looked at each claim in turn.\n\nThis is broadly in line with the best estimates available, based on the seats parties won at the 2015 general election, although the numbers are not quite perfect (there are 650 constituencies in the UK, but the numbers in this image only add up to 648).\n\nEstimating referendum results by parliamentary constituency isn\u2019t easy, because the results weren\u2019t counted by constituency seat. Some councils released a breakdown of votes by constituency as well (although they didn\u2019t have to), and the BBC accessed some data via Freedom of Information requests.\n\nThe best overall figures we have on this are estimates from Professor Chris Hanretty, a political scientist at Royal Holloway University, who combined official results and the BBC data with statistical methods in order to estimate the proportion of Leave and Remain voters in every seat in England, Scotland and Wales (Northern Ireland published results by constituency). We\u2019ve written more about these calculations here.\n\nProfessor Hanretty estimated that 64% of seats in Great Britain probably voted to leave, or around 403 constituencies. Including the known results for Northern Ireland, that amounts to 410 constituencies voting leave (63%) and 240 voting remain.\n\nOnce again, the numbers in this claim are not quite perfect but the trend is broadly correct.\n\nUsing Professor Hanretty\u2019s estimates, and looking at the results from the 2015 general election, 249 Conservative-voting constituencies probably voted to leave, while 81 probably voted to remain (not including the speaker\u2019s constituency Buckingham, which probably voted to remain, based on these estimates).\n\n148 Labour-voting seats probably voted to leave, while 84 probably voted to remain, which is exactly what the image says.\n\nProfessor Hanretty acknowledges that we can\u2019t be certain about these numbers though, as there is some margin for error in the calculation.\n\nBut if you take out the constituencies where there\u2019s most uncertainty about the result, the general pattern is still the same.\n\nOf course, there has since been another general election, so these figures don\u2019t reflect the situation today. However, even based on the 2017 general election results, the pattern is broadly the same.\n\nThe image is correct in saying that nine regions overall voted to leave and three voted to remain (Scotland, Northern Ireland and London).\n\nAgain, these numbers don\u2019t add up to 650, with four MPs unaccounted for.\n\nIt\u2019s based on MPs elected at the 2015 general election, rather than the current set of MPs we have now, who were elected in 2017. It also refers to those MPs stated positions before the referendum, rather than after the result.\n\nThe figures quoted are similar to the results of a survey by the Press Association, which asked every MP how they would vote in the referendum just before it happened in 2016.\n\n480 said they would vote to remain, 159 said they would vote to leave, and 11 MPs did not declare. Politics Home published a similar article just before the referendum, based on public statements by the MPs, which concluded that 485 intended to vote remain, 156 to leave, and 9 had not declared.\n\nOf course, we can\u2019t know for sure how each MP voted in the referendum, so surveying them or using public statements is the best we\u2019ve got.\n\nProviding a more up to date figure is difficult. The more recent 2017 general election means some MPs have changed, and others have changed their position since the referendum result.\n\nWe also know that many MPs who voted remain have since supported measures to leave the EU. 498 MPs voted in February 2017 in favour of triggering Article 50, which formally began the UK\u2019s exit process from the EU. Additionally, 286 voted in favour of Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement in March 2019. During two rounds of the \u201cindicative vote\u201d process in March and April, the two options that would have opened the door to parliament potentially revoking Article 50 were defeated, each gaining fewer than 200 votes.", "lang": "en"}
