The statement in the headline \u201cNo Racism in Russia\u201d is not what the football player quoted in the report said. In fact, he said: \u201cI have never had such an experience.\u201d The headline misleadingly gives the impression that the statement was made by a Chinese person, when in reality it was made by Odil Akhmedov, an ethnic Uzbek from Uzbekistan, a Central Asian nation that was part of the Soviet Union.\n\n\u200bSputnik issued the report as Russia, which is set to host the 2018 soccer World Cup, faces racism charges made by FIFA, the international soccer governing body.\n\nFIFA imposed disciplinary charges on Russia after fans in St. Petersburg responded to France\u2019s 3-1 victory in a friendly match against Russia with monkey chants aimed at French players Ousmane Dembele and Paul Pogba.\n\nRussian fans were accused of racist behavior during the last two European Championships. In both instances, the Russian Football Union paid a fine.\n\nEurope\u2019s anti-discrimination watchdog Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE) reported 89 racist and far-right incidents at Russian games in the 2016 - 2017 season alone.\n\nFans of the Russian soccer team Zenit St. Petersburg, whose city will host the 2018 World Cup semifinal, have been accused of racism on three separate occasions in recent years, including an episode during a game against Leipzig in March 2018 in which fans were accused of racist behavior and throwing objects.\n\nZenit has an official fan club, called Landcrona, which in 2012 published a manifesto declaring who should and who should not be allowed to play for Zenit. Called \u201cThe Principles of Selection,\u201d this manifesto states: \u201cWe are not racists, and for us the absence of the black skinned players in Zenit is merely an important tradition that highlights the identity of our club.\u201d\n\nThe only non-white player ever hired by Zenit \u2013 Hulk, a Brazilian forward -- was removed from the team\u2019s World Cup draw after he publicly complained about \u201ceveryday\u201d racism in Russian football.\n\n\u200bZenit is not the only Russian soccer club to have been charged with racism. Other major clubs have their own history of racist behavior, including Moscow\u2019s Spartak and the Russian Army\u2019s team, TSKA.", "lang": "en"}
