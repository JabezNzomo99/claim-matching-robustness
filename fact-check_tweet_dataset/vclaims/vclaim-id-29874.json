The claim is false; the video shows the sultan giving advice to his new ministers in 2018.\n\nThis video has been viewed more than one million times after it was published on February 15, 2018, on YouTube.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Indonesian-language title translates to English as: \u201cThe Sultan of Brunei Darussalam\u2019s sharp criticism of Jokowi\u201d.\n\n\u201cJokowi\u201d is the nickname of Indonesian President Joko Widodo.\n\nThe YouTube video has been shared with the same claim on Twitter here, here, here and here.\n\nThe claim is false; the video actually shows the sultan giving advice to Brunei\u2019s new ministers in 2018.\n\nA reverse image search and a subsequent keyword search on Google found this February 7, 2018, news video by Brunei state broadcaster Radio Televisyen Brunei (RTB) on its official YouTube channel.\n\nThe RTB news video, which is 43 minutes and 41 seconds in length, starts with two news hosts presenting a segment about the sultan\u2019s speech.\n\nThe video\u2019s Malay-language title translates to English as: \u201cPrime News February 7, 2018\u201d.\n\nThe clip in the misleading YouTube post starts at the 15-minute 51-second mark in the RTB video. In this section, the sultan can be heard giving advice to the new ministers about the need to uphold the country\u2019s state ideology principles.\n\nThe sultan's comments in Malay translate to English as: \u201cIf you want to become a good leader, strongly uphold these principles. And do not become a leader who is hungry for power, who is doing something for personal benefits rather than for the interests of the nation. Among the characteristics of a power-hungry leader are: sly, making a plan or strategy for personal gains, such as committing cronyism and nepotism to strengthen his position and power. I am sure these acts will not bring anything good but bad things to the nation. And we cannot let them prevail.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the video in the misleading post (L) and the RTB video from the 15-minute 51-second mark (R):\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s Office published this transcript of the sultan\u2019s speech on February 7, 2018.\n\nBelow is a screenshot showing a part of the lengthy transcript; AFP has highlighted sentences spoken in the misleading clip in blue:\n\nThe Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, is not mentioned anywhere in the video or the transcript.\n\nBrunei\u2019s state newspaper, Pelita Brunei, published this report about the sultan\u2019s speech on its front page on February 10, 2018.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the newspaper:\n\nThe Malay-language report's main headline translates to English as: \u201cDo your job for the nation\u201d.\n\nThe front page also carries a photo of the sultan delivering speech. The photo\u2019s background matches the background seen in the misleading clip and the original footage.\n\nThe misleading YouTube post was previously debunked by Indonesian news outlet Tempo here.", "lang": "en"}
