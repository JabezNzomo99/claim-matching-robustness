Information from the State Department shows there isn\u2019t an embassy in at least four of those six.\n\nDavid Lapan, spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, referred us to information posted on the State Department\u2019s website regarding countries with limited or no U.S. visa services. U.S. embassies and consulates sometimes limit or suspend their visa services for reasons that include natural disasters, civil unrest, war and security concerns, the State Department said.\n\nThe State Department website said the United States does not have diplomatic relationships with Iran, therefore no U.S. embassy or consulate in that country. Other countries listed as having no diplomatic relationship were Bhutan and North Korea.\n\nThe State Department\u2019s website said that on July 26, 2014, the U.S. embassy in Tripoli, Libya, \"went on ordered departure and staff temporarily departed due to the ongoing fighting around our embassy and the serious risks faced by our diplomatic personnel.\"\n\nThe ambassador to Libya and a core group of personnel work from the U.S. embassy in Tunis, Tunisia.\n\nSince visa services are unavailable in Libya, the State Department designated the U.S. Consulate General in Casablanca, Morocco, \"as the processing post\" for visa applications from Libyan immigrants.\n\nThe U.S. embassy in Damascus, Syria, suspended its operations in February 2012. U.S. citizens in need of emergency assistance are to contact the embassy of the Czech Republic in Damascus, which acts as a protecting power for U.S. citizens.\n\nU.S. passports or visas are not issued in Syria.\n\nThe United States does not have an embassy or diplomatic presence in Somalia. It has a mission to Somalia that operates out of Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nThe United States does have an embassy in Khartoum, Sudan.\n\nIt also has an embassy in Sana\u2019a, Yemen, but out of political and security concerns has reduced its staffing to \"minimal levels.\" The embassy has also suspended its consular services, the State Department said. The U.S. embassy in Cairo, Egypt processes visas for Yemeni citizens.\n\nTrump\u2019s first executive order included Iraq, but the country was left out in the revised order. The United States does have an embassy in Iraq\u2019s capital, Baghdad.\n\nHaving an embassy helps in the vetting process because that's where the State Department can do most of its questioning, said Bill Hing, an immigration expert and law professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law.\n\nThough refugees from areas of conflict are also often vetted at U.S. embassies in other countries, Hing said.\n\nKelly said, \"Many of the countries in question (in Trump\u2019s travel ban) don't even have a U.S. embassy there to help us vet.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s revised executive order aimed to temporarily suspend entry of nationals from Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. The United States does not have an embassy in at least four of those six countries.", "lang": "en"}
