A similar expression appears in the works of the Greek biographer Plutarch.\n\nThere is no shortage of Facebook posts quoting the founding fathers. Yet while Franklin was highly quotable, there\u2019s no evidence the postmaster general ever said the quote in question.\n\nNo record of it or any variation appears in the collected writings of Franklin.\n\n\u201cNothing like the quotation appears to be in Founders Online,\u201d David Sewell of the University of Virginia Press told the Caller. \u201cMy sense is that it doesn\u2019t sound like Franklin, but he may have said something similar.\u201d\n\nGeorge Goodwin, author of the book \u201cBen Franklin in London,\u201d could not find any evidence of the quote either. \u201cIt is believable, because it is in the Franklin style; but quotes, like works of art, have to [have] proven provenance,\u201d he told the Caller in an email.\n\nPlutarch attributed a similar expression to the Athenian poet and statesman Solon. \u201cBeing asked, namely, what city was best to live in, \u2018That city,\u2019 he replied, \u2018in which those who are not wronged, no less than those who are wronged, exert themselves to punish the wrongdoers,'\u201d he wrote in \u201cParallel Lives.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
