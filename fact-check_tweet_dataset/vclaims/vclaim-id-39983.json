Any shorting above 0.5% of the value of the company is made publicly available.\n\nThe data doesn\u2019t seem to show any spike\n\nA key premise of the Byline Times article is that the number of \u201cshort\u201d positions taken out by UK firms dramatically increased after Boris Johnson announced his candidacy for the Conservative leadership, and reached a peak in the week that he was announced as the winner.\n\nWe think they\u2019ve made a mistake in this analysis: they only looked at the short positions that were still active at the time they gathered the data.\n\nBy their nature, short positions may only last for a relatively brief period of time, after which the borrowed shares are returned. The data the FCA provides is split into two parts: \u201ccurrent\u201d, which lists all the positions still active, and \u201chistoric\u201d, which lists the positions where the transaction had ended or the number of shares being shorted has since changed.\n\nIf you only look at the \u201ccurrent\u201d data, then you\u2019re obviously going to see a larger number of short positions in recent weeks compared to many months ago: the older positions will have ended or been altered since. We don\u2019t know quite when Byline Times gathered the data they used, but using the most recent \u201ccurrent\u201d data\u2014going up to 8 September\u2014produces a graph that looks very similar in shape to the one in their article:\n\nBut if you include all the historical data as well, then you don\u2019t see any such spike for the period covered by the Byline Times article:\n\nThis apparent error has also been pointed out by several journalists on Twitter, including Louis Goddard of Global Witness and Luke Bailey of the i.\n\nWe asked Byline Times to share the data they used; they told us they would be publishing another article explaining their methodology, which they subsequently did. The article says they were \u201cseeking to understand why\u201d others could not replicate their findings.\n\nByline Times suggested the reason may be because \u201cByline Times counted the number of position holders taking out positions, not the number of short positions\u201d (despite the graphs in original article claiming they showed the \u201cnumber of short positions\u201d). They also said that they excluded all non-UK firms from their data. We don\u2019t think that these factors are sufficient to explain the discrepancy; even just looking at a small number of UK firms and counting the number of position holders produces figures larger than some of the weeks shown in their graphs.\n\nWe asked Byline Times to share the list of UK firms they were working from, and would suggest that doing so would help others assess their work.\n\nThere are other questions about the article\n\nThis is not the only potential issue with the article. The article also claims that the UK firms taking out those short positions were \u201calmost entirely dominated\u201d by firms that had either \u201cdirectly, or through their directorships of other companies\u201d donated to the Vote Leave campaign.\n\nWe have asked Byline Times for more information on which firms they consider to have been direct or indirect Vote Leave donors; they told us they would not release this information for \u201clegal reasons\u201d because they had not contacted those firms. Their follow-up article does not detail the methodology they used to identify these firms as direct or indirect donors.\n\nThe Financial Times has also raised a number of issues with the article, notably with the premise that a short position is necessarily a \u201cbet on no deal\u201d as the article suggests. For example, they point out that some companies would likely benefit from a no deal Brexit; shorting them would be effectively be betting against no deal.", "lang": "en"}
