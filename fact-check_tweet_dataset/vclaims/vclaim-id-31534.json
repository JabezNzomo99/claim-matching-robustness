Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of Bhim Army Chief Chandra Shekhar Aazad being admitted in a hospital as he was beaten up in Rajasthan today. Fact: The video is an old one. Chandra Shekhar Aazad was admitted in a hospital in Meerut, on 12 March 2019, after he was detained by the UP Police for organising an alleged illegal procession and subsequently fell ill. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nThe same video was found to be uploaded on YouTube in March 2019. So, when searched for any news regarding Aazad\u2019s hospitalization in March 2019, it was found that he was admitted in a hospital in Meerut on 12 March 2019. In the NDTV article, published in March 2019, it can be read that \u2018Azad was arrested at Deoband in Saharanpur but had to be admitted in a hospital in Meerut after he was taken ill\u2019. The news about his illness was also tweeted from his official Twitter account. More about the incident can be read here and here. So, the incident happened last year and it is not related to Rajasthan.\n\nTo sum it up, an old video falsely shared as \u2018Bhim Army Chief Chandra Shekhar Aazad beaten in Rajasthan today\u2019.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
