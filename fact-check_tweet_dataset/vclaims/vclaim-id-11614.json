Republicans lost a seat it held in Nevada. In Mississippi, a Republican and Democrat are headed to a Nov. 27 runoff, where the Republican is favored.\n\nSo, as we write this, Republicans have 51 seats in the Senate and are likely to add one more in Mississippi. The number can grow to 54 if the races in Arizona and Florida stay the GOP\u2019s way.\n\nTrump, who campaigned vigorously for a handful of Republican candidates in tight races, sought to highlight the historical significance of his party\u2019s Senate wins.\n\n\"This election marks the largest Senate gains for a president's party in a first midterm election since at least President Kennedy's in 1962,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump\u2019s read of historical election tallies depends on the outcome of the outstanding outcomes in Mississippi, Arizona and Florida.\n\nFew presidents\u2019 first midterm elections in modern American political history have yielded Senate gains for the president\u2019s party.\n\nPart of the equation in this particular election was that Democrats\u2019 were disadvantaged by the fact that they were defending more seats than Republicans. That included 10 states Trump won handily in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIt\u2019s also not unprecedented that the House and Senate end up split between two parties following a midterm.\n\nStill, it\u2019s fairly unusual for a president\u2019s party to notch a net gain in the Senate during a president\u2019s first midterm, as the data from 538.com below shows:\n\nNo matter how things turn out, Trump\u2019s party fared much better in the Senate than Democrats did during President Barack Obama\u2019s first midterm election, which he famously conceded was a \"shellacking.\"\n\nBut the outstanding elections will determine if Trump\u2019s claim is ultimately correct.\n\nPresident George W. Bush saw Republicans net two Senate seats in 2002, while President Richard Nixon and Republicans gained one seat in 1970, according to 538.com.\n\nIf the results hold and Republicans win in Mississippi, Florida and Arizona, Trump would be correct that Republicans\u2019 Senate gains in the 2018 midterms (+3) represent the largest first midterm Senate pickup since President John F. Kennedy\u2019s Democratic party gained four seats in 1962.\n\nThose races are not yet called, though. While Republicans are in a better position in all three states, Trump is counting gains that are not yet certain. We rate statements based on what's known at the time they were made.
