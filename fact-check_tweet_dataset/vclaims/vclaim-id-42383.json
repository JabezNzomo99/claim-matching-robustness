Furthermore, the WHO estimated in February that the first vaccine could take around 18 months to be ready.\n\nBOOM received the message on its WhatsApp helpline with the caption: \"Trump announced that Roche Medical Company will launch the vaccine next Sunday, and millions of doses are ready from it !!! The end of the play\"\n\nThe message was accompanied by the following video:\n\n\n\nSearching for the caption on Twitter, we found that it was viral on the microblogging site as well. \n\n\n\nBOOM searched for the keywords \"Roche Coronavirus Vaccine\" and came across news reports from March 13 about testing company Roche Diagnostics getting rapid approval and support from the FDA and CDC to provide a new testing solution to health researchers around the world, that is expected to speed up the testing process by tenfold.\n\nWe found a longer version of the video uploaded by the White House's official YouTube channel on March 13, which shows a press conference organised by the White House. At the 18:39 mark you can see the segment of the video that is viral on WhatsApp, where Roche Diagnostics CEO Matthew Sause thanks the FDA and the CDC for the timely approval of \"emergency use authorisation\" for testing the coronavirus, in presence of Trump. \n\n\n\nIn a press release dated March 13, 2020 Roche said the test would help to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, using swab samples of patients. Hospitals and laboratories could run the test using Roche's systems which are widely available in the US and around the world, the company said.\n\nThe company also explained that the cobas SARS-CoV-2 Test has not been FDA cleared or approved.The test has been authorised only for the detection of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 virus and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, not for any other viruses or pathogens, Roche said.

On February 11, WHO Direct General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced that \"the first vaccine could be ready in 18 months\".\n\n\n\nAssociated Press reported that researchers at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute in Seattle conducted the first-stage study of a potential COVID-19 vaccine, which is being tested on volunteers. \"Even if the research goes well, a vaccine would not be available for widespread use for 12 to 18 months,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci of the U.S. National Institutes of Health told AP.\n\nMeanwhile the US administration along with Trump have faced severe criticism for playing down the seriousness of the outbreak and not testing enough.", "lang": "en"}
