Shame on paid protests.\".\n\nClick here to view, and here for an archive.\n\nThe clip has been viewed by around 13,000 viewers while writing the article.

The caption of the video reads, 'Bhopal'.\n\nAnother clip posted on January 5, 2019, on YouTube with the title reads, \"Bhopal k chowk market me aurto ki ye ladai has k lot pot krdegi.\" The location of the video is tagged as 'chowk bazaar bhopal'.\n\nThe description section of the video when translated reads, \"After their vehicles hit, look at how these girls are fighting.\"\n\nBOOM was unable to independently verify the source of the video or the incident in question, however the video was not shot recently from Shaheen Bagh, Delhi as being claimed.\n\nThe same video was earlier tweeted by Pakistan born Canadian Twitter influencer Tarek Fatah in May 2019 as from Delhi. BOOM has previously debunked misleading and fake posts shared by Fatah. (here, here)", "lang": "en"}
