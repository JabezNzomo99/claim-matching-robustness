Those few paragraphs devoted to describing the condition of the inmates held in that jail went on to be widely circulated on the Internet although they formed only the smallest portion of the original piece, an article that described the air\u2019s heat creating turbulence for airplanes overhead, car windshields shattering or falling out, dogs burning their paws on the pavement, and candles melting indoors:\n\nIt\u2019s even hotter than usual in Phoenix, the Associated Press reports: About 2,000 inmates living in a barbed-wire-surrounded tent encampment at the Maricopa County Jail have been given permission to strip down to their government-issued pink boxer shorts. On Wednesday, hundreds of men wearing boxers were either curled up on their bunk beds or chatted in the tents, which reached inside the week before. Many were also swathed in wet, pink towels as sweat collected on their chests and dripped down to their pink socks. \u201cIt feels like you are in a furnace,\u201d said James Zanzo\u2019t, an inmate who has lived in the tents for \u201cIt\u2019s inhumane.\u201d Joe Arpaio, the tough-guy sheriff who created the tent city and long ago started making his prisoners wear pink, is not sympathetic. He said Wednesday that he told the inmates: \u201cIt\u2019s in Iraq and the soldiers are living in tents and they didn\u2019t commit any crimes, so shut your mouths. \u201d KIND OF PUTS THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE DOESN\u2019T IT?\n\nA clue as to the \u2018why\u2019 of the selective quoting is contained in the tagline now often part of the forwards: \u201cKind of puts things in perspective doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Someone was struck by the comparison of the kvetching prisoners to the (presumed uncomplaining) troops serving in Iraq, and was moved to excerpt only that portion of the article to share with others. That the forward has proved as popular as it has shows the comparison resonates with a great many.\n\nThe U.S. soldiers serving in Iraq may well be bona fide tough-as-nails servicemen, but at least in our mental image of them we also need them to be larger than life. We like to think of them as lantern-jawed heroes coolly dealing with the impossible situation that is Iraq without giving so much as a thought to their personal safety or even letting as little as a complaining word fall from their lips about the miserable conditions they must endure during that tour of duty. The juxtaposition of these brave soldiers to the societal dregs that wash up into a county jail is thus eminently satisfying to contemplate \u2014 it\u2019s the comparison of giants to ants, working to exalt the one even as it makes the other look petty and small.\n\nYet if the prisoners housed in Arizona\u2019s Maricopa County jails were complaining, they had some good reasons. At that facility the incarcerated were fed only two meals a day, with green bologna sometimes appearing on the menu. They were quartered in outdoor tents under sweltering conditions, and they slept on cots which lack pillows. They worked on chain gangs. And they wore pink underwear.\n\nFormer Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, of the \u201cIt\u2019s in Iraq and the soldiers are living in tents and they didn\u2019t commit any crimes, so shut your mouths\u201d quote, reveled in the sobriquet \u2018America\u2019s Toughest Sheriff.\u2019 He enjoyed a very high voter approval rating for a time and had little trouble being to his post multiple times. He was a controversial figure, vilified by some and worshipped by others.\n\nIn June 2004 the e-mailed excerpt from the July 2003 Associated Press article circulated anew on the Internet, this time prefaced as follows:\n\nThis is the way he is, and he has been re-elected several times \u2026 Sheriff Joe Arpaio (in Arizona) is doing it RIGHT!!: He has jail meals down to 40 cents a serving and charges the inmates for them. He stopped smoking and porno magazines in the jails. Took away their weights. Cut off all but He started chain gangs so the inmates could do free work on county and city projects. Then he started chain gangs for women so he wouldn\u2019t get sued for discrimination. He took away cable TV until he found out there was a federal court order that required cable TV for jails. So he hooked up the cable TV again but only let in the Disney channel and the weather channel. When asked why the weather channel he replied, so they will know how hot it\u2019s gonna be while they are working on my chain gangs. He cut off coffee since it has zero nutritional value. When the inmates complained, he told them\u2026. this is a good one\u2026\u2026\u201dThis isn\u2019t the Ritz/Carlton. If you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t come back.\u201d He bought Newt Gingrich\u2019 lecture series on videotape that he pipes into the jails. When asked by a reporter if he had any lecture series by a Democrat, he replied that a democratic lecture series might explain why a lot of the inmates were in his jails in the first place. You have to love this guy!! [at this point, the text quoted above was repeated]\n\nWith one exception (which could simply amount to no more than our not having yet found the right supporting articles), the claims made in the 2004 preface checked out. Sheriff Joe Arpaio did ban smoking, coffee, pornographic magazines, movies, and unrestricted television in all his jails. Those incarcerated in his tent city jail did indeed work on chain gangs, pull weeds for the city and county, clear brush, and the like. In 1996 the Sheriff put the nation\u2019s first female chain gang to work. Although the account made it sound as if he did so out of fear of prosecution for discrimination, there was no such threat lurking in the background \u2014 he chose that course of action because it suited his beliefs: \u201cI don\u2019t believe in discrimination in my jail system. Crime knows no gender and neither should punishment,\u201d he said.\n\nRegarding the claim about his airing a Newt Gingrich lecture series on the jail\u2019s television system, in 1995 the controversial lawman used canteen funds to buy the Republican House speaker\u2019s lecture series with the intent of piping it into the inmates\u2019 cells. When asked if he\u2019d also be providing those in his charge with a lecture series done by a Democrat, he replied in the negative. \u201cFor one thing I don\u2019t know of any,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd some people might say these guys already got enough of those ideas.\u201d\n\nHe was also proud of having lowered the cost of feeding inmates in his care. Though assorted news articles quoted slightly differing figures, a per serving expenditure was the one most often touted. \u201cIt costs more to feed our police dogs than our inmates. The dogs never committed a crime, and they\u2019re working for a living,\u201d Arpaio said.\n\nIn 1998 Arpaio instituted a policy of charging inmates for their meals, levying a dollar-a-day tariff against each of those incarcerated. In 1994 he banned coffee from the Maricopa County Jail, but he did so not because of its lack of nutritional value, but to protect inmates and guards from hot-coffee assaults by other inmates and to lower costs. (By eliminating the estimated 5,000 cups of coffee served daily for 5,400 inmates, it was expected the county would save $94,158 a year.)\n\nThe one item we have yet to validate is the assertion that Arpaio deprived inmates of until discovery that such act was in violation of a federal court order. We\u2019ve yet to locate this order or to confirm that television programming was ever denied those in his care. It is on record, however, that inmates in his charge view only selected programming, such as what\u2019s on The Weather Channel. (\u201cI think my chain gang deserves to know how hot it is when they hit the streets,\u201d said Arpaio.)\n\nIn September 2007 the following forwards about Sheriff Arpaio began to circulate:\n\nSheriff Joe is at it again. Maricopa County was spending approx. $18 million dollars a year on stray animals, like cats and dogs. Sheriff Joe offered to take the department over, and the County Supervisors said \u201cOkay.\u201d The animal shelters are now all staffed and operated by prisoners. They feed and care for the strays. Every animal in his care is taken out and walked twice daily. He now has prisoners who are experts in animal nutrition and behavior. They give great classes for anyone who\u2019d like to adopt an animal. He has literally taken stray dogs off the street, given them to the care of prisoners, and had them placed in dog shows. The best part? His budget for the entire department is now under Now he\u2019s in trouble with the ACLU again. He painted all his buses and vehicles with a mural that has a special hotline phone number painted on it, where you can call and report suspected illegal aliens.\n\n Immigrations and Customs Enforcement wasn\u2019t doing enough in his eyes, so he had trained specifically for enforcing immigration laws, started up his hotline, and bought buses just for hauling folks back to the border.\n\nAlthough Sheriff Joe Arpaio did not (as implied above) take over the operations of the entire Maricopa County Animal (MCACC) department, he was instrumental in the opening of the Maricopa Animal Safe Hospice (MASH), a animal shelter operated by the Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Office (MCSO) in what was formerly Phoenix\u2019s First Avenue Jail. The MASH is a facility dedicated to caring for rescued animals that have been abused or neglected (as well as temporarily caring for the pets of owners who have checked into domestic violence shelters):\n\nIn July 2007 Sheriff Arpaio launched a hot line for calling in tips and information about people living and working in Maricopa County illegally. Then in September 2007 he unveiled \u201cmoving billboards\u201d in the form of four trucks and eight inmate passenger vans plastered with the hot line number and signs reading \u201cDo Not Illegally Enter\u201d and \u201cHelp Sheriff Joe Arpaio Fight Illegal Immigration and Trafficking.\u201d Critics contend that this move constitutes racial profiling; Sheriff Arpaio maintains that his signs say nothing about ethnic backgrounds: \u201cIt says illegal immigration and trafficking. I don\u2019t care where they\u2019re from.\u201d\n\nSheriff Arpaio finally stepped down after losing a re-election bid to Democrat Paul Penzone in 2016.", "lang": "en"}
