We (Australia) are growing faster than any G7 country, except the United States ...\u201d\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg claims Australia\u2019s economy is growing faster than any country in the G7, bar the US. [1]\n\nAAP FactCheck contacted Mr Frydenberg\u2019s office to verify the source of his claim. The treasurer\u2019s office said the source for the Australian figures was the 2018 calendar year National Accounts.\n\nAustralia\u2019s economy grew by 2.7 per cent in the calendar year 2018, according to the National Accounts. [2]\n\nThe Group of Seven or G7 is a forum set up in 1975 of the world's largest developed countries - France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. The G7 is considered the best framework for global economic coordination. Since 1987, G7 finance ministers and central bank governors have met twice a year. [3] [4]\n\nUsing International Monetary Fund data to compare Australia\u2019s economic growth with G7 countries for 2018, Mr Frydenberg\u2019s claim is correct.\n\nAustralia\u2019s growth of 2.7 per cent last year outstripped Canada (1.8 per cent), France (1.5 per cent), Britain (1.4 per cent), Germany (1.4 per cent), Italy (0.9 per cent) and Japan (0.8 per cent). The US was the best performer with economic growth of 2.9 per cent. [5]\n\nUsing the 2018 calendar year as a measure, Mr Frydenberg\u2019s claim is accurate.", "lang": "en"}
