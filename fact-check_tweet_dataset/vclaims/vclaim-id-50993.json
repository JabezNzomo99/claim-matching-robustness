No, that's not true: The New York representative did not make such a statement. It is a claim from an article published by a well-known satirical site that trolls conservatives. These stories are often copied by other websites that republish them without any satire labeling, presenting them as real news.\n\nThe claim originated from an article (archived here) where it was published by BustaTroll.com on January 16, 2020, under the title \"AOC Suggests the Earth May Be Flat\". It opened:\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nThe outspoken Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat, is a favorite target of conservatives - and a popular character among satirical websites like BustaTroll.com.\n\nThe site is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run by self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact-checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other fact-checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire.
