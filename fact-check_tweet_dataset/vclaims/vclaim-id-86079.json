So our antenna went up when we saw Navarro, the White House director of trade and industrial policy, repeatedly attribute the building of a rolling aluminum plant in Kentucky to the president\u2019s tariff and tax policies.\n\nBraidy chief executive Craig Bouchard \u201cpredicts that the old American steel and aluminum giants will eventually disappear and be replaced by young, nimble companies with nonunionized workforces,\u201d the article said. \u201cIn other words, President Trump could revive American manufacturing simply by letting creative destruction run its course. Protectionist policies that prop up haggard businesses could slow this regeneration and stall the advances Mr. Bouchard sees coming \u2014 which would be a loss for far more people than those 550 workers in Ashland.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight-to-work was a necessary condition,\u201d Sealey said. We only looked at potential sites in 3 right-to-work States.\u201d She added that \u201cthe single most important ingredient was the available skilled and dedicated work force. The State proved to us that there are eight times more metal working families employable in the Ashland region than anywhere else in the United States.\u201d\n\nSince this is a rolling aluminum plant, not a smelting plant, the tariffs will actually increase the plant\u2019s costs, as Bouchard acknowledged in a recent CNBC interview. \u201cOur costs for an aluminum rolling mill in Ashland, Kentucky, will go up because expenditure for our prime input, prime aluminum, will go up,\u201d he said. But he indicated the company would pass on the costs to consumers and said that overall the tariffs are a good thing because it will raise the overall price of aluminum.\n\n\u201cThe cost of project has increased, however, if they are announcing it costs closer to $1.6 billion now. That could be impacted by the higher price of steel and shortage of construction-related contract labor,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cTariffs are never a good thing. Maybe a short term temporary evil because of Chinese proliferation in upstream metals manufacturing over the two decades, but historically have proven to be incredibly destructive to underlying demand.\u201d\n\n\u201cSteel prices rose during the past year and increased the construction cost of the mill in the process,\u201d Bouchard told The Fact Checker. \u201cAlso, we lived through an increase in cost due to a strong euro, because most of our equipment is German. But all that was countered by the rise in aluminum prices and our pre-sales of the mill. And tax reform was very positive for us. So the net cash result was very positive.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur corporate leadership does believe that the recently-enacted tariffs have played a supporting role in the construction of our mill,\u201d Sealey said. \u201cSpecifically, two months ago, our mill was 180 percent sold out for seven years. Following the announcement of the tariffs, our mill is now 230 percent sold out for seven years, with customers now pushing us to move forward to binding agreements. Tariffs, along with tax reform, have had a net positive impact on our business, profitability and growth trajectory.\u201d\n\nBouchard, in an email, said he supported the aluminum tariffs because he is concerned that there is only one domestic supplier of \u201chigh purity\u201d aluminum and 85 percent comes from imports. But, he added, \u201cI believe the current situation would be more favorable to all if we stepped back and rightly viewed the Canadians as part of us. They are our strongest ally. They ship 2.7 million tons of prime aluminum into the U.S. each year.\u201d He said Canada should receive an exemption.\n\nAs we have noted before, the North American aluminum market is integrated, with much of the smelting taking place in Canada, one of the United States\u2019 closest allies, where electricity costs are lower because of hydropower. (Aluminum smelting is an energy-intensive industry.) Charles Bradford of Bradford Research in New York said many U.S. factories closed because long-term electrical contracts expired and they \u201ccould no longer compete on cheap power.\u201d\n\nNavarro repeatedly suggests this plant was built because of the president\u2019s tax and tariff policies. But the plant was put in motion well before Trump took the oath of office, for reasons having nothing to do with his presidency. The president\u2019s policies appear to have made the plant more economically viable, but it appears it would have been launched without those policies. We wavered between Two and Three Pinocchios and ultimately settled on Two, given the company\u2019s statement about a supporting role. In his television appearances, Navarro should not be so sweeping in his declarations about the link between Trump and the Kentucky plant.", "lang": "en"}
