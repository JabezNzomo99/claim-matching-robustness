The claim is false; the video actually shows US fighter jets at the Kunsan air base in South Korea.\n\nThis Facebook post which includes the video has been viewed 3.4 million times and shared more than 264,500 times since it was first posted on May 27, 2016.\n\nThe post\u2019s Urdu-language caption translates as: \u201cThis is not France, not the US, not Russia but a Pakistani air base. Share this video and scare the hell out of the enemy.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe video has also been shared by other Facebook accounts with the same claim that it shows a Pakistani air base, including here and here.\n\nThese two posts were also originally shared in 2016. The videos in the two posts have since received more than 460,000 views between them.\n\nIn March 2019, the Urdu News post was re-shared days after India claimed it had bombed a militant camp and killed a large number of insurgents in disputed Kashmir on February 26, 2019. Pakistan said February 27 that it had shot down an Indian jet.\n\nHere is an AFP story on the situation.\n\nThe misleading Facebook video was actually filmed at the Kunsan air base in South Korea.\n\nA reverse image search of keyframes of the clips using the InVID video verification tool found that the footage was originally uploaded to a verified YouTube channel with more than 1.6 million subscribers called \u2018AiirSourceMilitary\u2019 on April 19, 2013.\n\nThe video is entitled \u2018Massive USAF F-16 Elephant Walk At Kunsan Air Base South Korea\u2019.\n\nBelow is a comparison of screenshots of the video from the misleading Facebook post and the video on the AiirSourceMilitary channel. The formation and style of the jets, as well as the terrain in the videos, is entirely consistent:\n\nThe 2013 video on the AiirSourceMilitary YouTube channel, which shows a wider frame for the clip than the misleading Facebook video, contains a watermark for Aiirsource.com.\n\nThe YouTube channel\u2019s \u2018About\u2019 section contains an official email contact associated with Aiirsource.com.\n\nThe Aiirsource.com website describes itself as a news site which covers the US army, navy, marine corps, air force and coast guard.\n\nThe jet fighter video on the AiirSourceMilitary YouTube channel is available to view in high definition (1080p), indicating Aiirsource.com received the video file from an original source.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the YouTube video with the watermark and high definition setting circled in red:\n\nThe channel credits SSgt Michael Schocker, 8th Fighter Wing Public Affairs as the source.\n\nSSgt Michael Schocker has captured other videos of Kunsan Air Base distributed by the US military\u2019s media centre, the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDs), since at least 2012.\n\nThe DVIDs website includes his video from May 2012 and another video he filmed in September 2012.\n\nOn his Facebook profile, Schocker lists himself as a former broadcaster at Kunsan Air Base. On February 6, 2019, he shared photos of his retirement ceremony.\n\nSatellite images of Kunsan Air Base on Google Maps correspond with the scene of the runway in the video of the fighter jets.\n\nThe style of the fighter jets in the video is also entirely consistent with a video of F-16 Fighting Falcon aircrafts at Kunsan Air Base on the US military\u2019s official website.\n\nBelow is a screenshot from the video:", "lang": "en"}
