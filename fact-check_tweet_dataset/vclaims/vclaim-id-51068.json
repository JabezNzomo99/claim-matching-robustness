In the aerial view, Binintiang Malaki is marked with a yellow circle. The text next to it says: \"this is what we were taught as Taal Volcano.\" In another part of the photo, an arrow pointing to the main crater of Taal is labeled \"the real Taal volcano.\"\n\nAnother version of the claim posted by several Facebook users shows an image of Binintiang Malaki with text that reads \"This is not the Taal Crater. This is 'Binintiang Malaki'.\" Another text on the image says, \u201cWe have been duped by postcards and images of fake Taal. This area has several craters, and one of them is the 'Binintiang Malaki.'\u201d \n\n\n\nThe facts: Taal Volcano has 47 craters, and Binintiang Malaki is among them. Taal is said to have erupted through this crater at least twice.\n\nWhat is currently erupting is Taal's main crater. However, according to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs), Taal Volcano is classified as a complex volcano system. This means the volcano does not have only one main vent, but several through which it can spew ash, lava, or magma.\n\nBinintiang Malaki's first recorded eruption was in 1707. It is said that this eruption led to its formation. Aside from the 1707 eruption, Binintiang Malaki also exploded in 1715.

According to its post, it is not correct to point out that Binintiang Malaki is the Taal Volcano. The claim resurfaced and spread on Facebook after the volcano began erupting on Sunday, January 12. \u2013 Glenda Marie Castro/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
