As one example, he said he did not consider \u201cdrunk driving\u201d as a felony that justified an ICE agent arresting someone.\n\nThey [the children of \u2018undocumented\u2019 immigrants] go off to school wondering whether their mom comes and picks them up, is she not going to be there because an ICE agent was there to arrest her? Or she takes them to the doctor, that she\u2019s going to not be there because she is \u2018undocumented\u2019 and an ICE agent is going to pick him up. [\u2026] You change the culture by saying you are going to get fired. You are fired if, in fact, you do that. You only arrest for the purpose of dealing with a felony that\u2019s committed, and I don\u2019t count drunk driving as a felony.\n\nThose remarks are recorded in the following video, beginning at the 3:04:55 mark:\n\nThe moment was highlighted in a headline published by the conservative Capitol-oriented news outlet Washington Examiner.\n\nAs the Examiner noted, driving under the influence (DUI) can constitute a felony, depending on the state where the offense occurred and the severity of the incident.\n\nThe Trump administration has come under fire for its immigration rhetoric and policy. In 2018, roughly half of the 158,000 people \u201cadministratively arrested\u201d by ICE had DUI charges or convictions.", "lang": "en"}
