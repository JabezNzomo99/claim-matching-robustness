According to the accompanying message, the photo is from late poet and author Dr Dharamvir Bharti\u2019s book. The image is claimed to capture a scene from the 1971 India-Pakistan war where a husband is carrying his wife who was raped multiple times. The message ends with the claim that the photo depicts the oppression of Hindus in Pakistan and Bangladesh\n\nIt is noteworthy that the image is being shared in the backdrop of the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) which seeks to provide a path for non-Muslim migrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan to apply for Indian citizenship.\n\nTwitter user @ChaanchalMaurya posted (archive link) the viral image. It was retweeted over 5,000 times.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, many Facebook and Twitter users have shared this image.\n\nAlt News performed a reverse image search on Yandex and found a YouTube video which carried the viral image. According to the video uploaded by Gracie Rosado in October 2014, the viral image was clicked by photographer Mark Edwards.\n\nAfter performing a keyword search, Alt News found the viral image on the website of Hard Rain Project, a charity founded by Edwards. The image was clicked by the photograher himself and it is described as, \u201cRefugees from East Pakistan arriving in India during the Bangladesh war in 1971.\n\nThe book \u2018Body Horror: Photojournalism, Catastrophe and War\u2019 by John Taylor also attributes Edwards for this image.\n\nWhile speaking with the website Rare Historical Photos (RHP) in August 2014, Edwards said, \u201cI took this profoundly disturbing picture of a man carrying his cholera-stricken wife during the Bangladesh war in 1971. Ten million people crossed the East Pakistan (Bangladesh) border into India to escape the horrors of this bloody war.\u201d\n\nAs per several online sources, Bangladesh witnessed an outbreak of cholera in 1971.\n\nAlt News reached out to Edwards over email for more details. He informed, \u201cI don\u2019t know if she died from cholera or not but there was absolutely no indication she was raped.\u201d\n\nThe photograph is, therefore, circulating with baseless claims in the view of the recently-enacted Citizenship Amendment Act.", "lang": "en"}
