No, despite claims in several trending reports there is no \"new university study\" or other scientific evidence to support the claim that installation of the latest evolution of mobile communication towers -- known as 5G -- has caused such harm. An indepth look at the sourcing of the articles revealed the \"new study\" is of questionable scientific value and was done several years before the first 5G towers were erected.\n\nThe story recently reappeared in an article published on March 4, 2019 titled \"Firefighters suffer neurological damage after contact with 5G cell towers\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe story includes an embedded version of a January 2018 report by San Francisco TV station KPIX in which Dr. Gunnar Heuser, a clinical toxicologist who said he recently \"came out of retirement\" to concentrate on the ill-affects of EMF (Electro Magnetic Field), shares his \"pilot study\" of firefighters at one fire station near a cell tower. However, his co-author posted a clarification that the study was done in 2004 and was related to 2G cell towers -- 14 years before the first 5G towers were installed in California.\n\nThe article also references a World Health Organization study about \"mounting concerns\" of health hazards from Electro Magnetic Fields in 2011 -- again seven years before 5G towers began propagating across the landscape. WHO did \"classify radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B), based on an increased risk for glioma, a malignant type of brain cancer1 , associated with wireless phone use.\" But, again, years before 5G.\n\nWhile this article and the warnings it raises are based on questionable sourcing, there is legitimate concern about 5G since hundreds of thousands of cell transmitters will be installed in communities across the United States. However, these questions should be addressed responsibily.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes healthnutnews.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
