Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) seized on a statement made on a late-night show, but he's jumping to conclusions.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2014-06-19T01:28:13Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-81264", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/06/19/did-epa-administrator-gina-mccarthy-declare-a-war-on-coal/", "vclaim": "Bill Maher: Last week announced, I think it was called the \u2018Clean Power Program.\u2019 Some people called it a war on coal. I hope it is a war on coal. Is it? McCarthy: Actually, EPA is all about fighting against pollution and fighting for public health. That\u2019s exactly what this is.\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s message here is certainly a bit muddled. When asked if there was a war on coal, she did not answer with a simple \u201cNo.\u201d Instead, she offered a line she has said many times before\u2014that the EPA fights against pollution. McConnell certainly appears to be leaping to a conclusion to think that \u201cthat\u2019s exactly what this is\u201d refers to the war on coal, instead of a fight against pollution.\n\nThe trouble is, others on the left also leapt to this conclusion. Maher seems thrilled with her answer and the audience applauds. Some environmental groups also quickly embraced the idea that McCarthy had admitted to a war on coal. Ecowatch.com, in an article headlined \u201cEPA Administrator Declares War on Coal on \u2018Real Time With Bill Maher,\u201d said she \u201crefused to tiptoe in describing what her announcement of the president\u2019s emissions proposal and goals really meant.\u201d Another Web site, Grist.org, was a bit more cautious but said: \u201cMcCarthy\u2019s kinda-declaration-of-war comes not a moment too soon. In fact, some would argue that it\u2019s long overdue.\u201d\n\nSen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.): \u201cAnd do you think it\u2019s fair to say, maybe the EPA has somewhat of a war on coal so that we can lessen our dependence upon coal in this country?\u201d McCarthy: \u201cSenator, I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s fair to say. What we\u2019re trying to do is our job to protect public health by reducing pollution from some of the largest sources \u2026\u201d\n\nPeter Cook: \u201cThe argument is this is a war on coal. You are putting coal out of business with this proposal.\u201d\n\n McCarthy: \u201cWell if you take a look at it, what we\u2019re projecting is that coal in 2030 will still be a very significant portion of the electric generating capacity here. And what we\u2019re hoping that folks will do is realize that this is an opportunity to actually make investments in coal, to make them more efficient so that we can have the best and cleanest facilities moving forward. But the ultimate choice is going to be up to the states. Do they want to shift towards more renewables? Do they want to focus on energy efficiency? Do they want to do all of those things together?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we were so surprised when she agreed with Bill Maher on his live television program,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter denying it over and over again, she went on TV and agreed with the host. Clearly we weren\u2019t the only ones who took it that way\u2014the host was pleased (\u2018oh, great!\u2019) and the audience applauded. She didn\u2019t correct the host or the audience. So either she agreed with the host (\u2018that\u2019s exactly what this is\u2019) or she let the host/audience have that impression uncorrected. I watched the show live and was stunned.\u201d\n\nBut this was live TV and people can make mistakes. This one gotcha moment has to be measured against the many times she made a clear denial. While her remarks are open to interpretation, McConnell (and others) were too quick to assume the most extreme interpretation. Now that she has firmly denied it, yet again, this so-called gaffe should be relegated to the dustbin of history.", "lang": "en"}
