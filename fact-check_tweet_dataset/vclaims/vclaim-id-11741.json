The claim is false. There are no known sightings of lions in Kogi state and the picture already appeared in a post labelled as Angola in March 2018.\n\nOn November 7, Facebook user \u201cEngr Solomon\u201d posted a picture with the message: \u201cThis great Igala Hunter killed the lion yesterday (6th December, 2018) at Ogbonicha.\u201d Ogbonicha is a town in Kogi State. The post has been shared more than 13,500 times.\n\nOther posts on Facebook and Twitter have also repeated the claims.\n\nThe earliest use of the image found by AFP was from a Twitter user based in Angola, @Paidalindahotm1. On March 11, 2018 he posted the image to Twitter, with the message in Portuguese reading: \u201cLe\u00e3o angolano foi morto.\u201d (Angolan lion is dead.)\n\nThe post was a reply to an earlier tweet which appeared to be a picture of himself. The two photos appear to show the same man, suggesting he was the person who killed the lion.\n\nAFP reached out to the twitter account but received no reply.\n\nThis same image was also shared on social media in August in a Facebook group with 12,000 followers called SansTabou-Guinea. In that post it was claimed it came from Guinea.\n\nAccording to research experts on conservation in West Africa, only two areas in Nigeria are home to lions: Kainji Lake National Park, in the northwest, where some 30 big cats were thought to be living, and Yankari Game Reserve in Bauchi state, northeast Nigeria, where researchers believe there are less than five lions.", "lang": "en"}
