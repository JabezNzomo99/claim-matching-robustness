The Supreme Court has upheld the law twice in the face of challenges from conservative groups. As coronavirus cases reached a new high in the United States, the Trump administration filed a legal brief on June 25 asking the Supreme Court to strike down the entire law, joining with a group of GOP state attorneys general who argue the ACA is unconstitutional.\n\nThe ACA prohibited this practice through two provisions: \u201cguaranteed issue,\u201d which means insurance companies must sell insurance to anyone who wants it, and \u201ccommunity rating,\u201d which means people in the same age group and geographic area who buy similar insurance pay similar prices. The changes made insurance affordable for people with serious diseases or even those with minor health problems, who also could have been denied coverage before the law\u2019s passage.\n\nGardner has been voting to repeal, defund or replace the ACA since 2011, the year after its passage. This year, his campaign website says nothing about the law, but his official Senate website says, \u201cFixing our healthcare system will require repealing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with patient-centered solutions, which empower Americans and their doctors.\u201d\n\nTrump told The Washington Post days before his inauguration in 2017 that he was nearly done with his plan to replace the ACA. Three and a half years later, no replacement plan has emerged from the administration and Republicans in Congress hardly agree on what it would look like \u2014 or how to preserve the protections for preexisting health conditions.\n\n\u201cInsurers before the Affordable Care Act had multiple and redundant ways that they could avoid people who had preexisting conditions,\u201d said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation. The Protect Act prevents some of those practices, but it \u201cleaves enough other loopholes that it would make it very possible and likely for insurers to be able to avoid paying benefits for the conditions they most worry about,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut it would leave many others on the cutting room floor,\u201d she wrote, because insurers would be able to exclude coverage of benefits such as maternity care, mental health and substance-use treatment; set annual and lifetime limits on insurance payouts; and charge older patients more than younger patients at greater levels than the ACA allows, among other changes.\n\nThe three senators\u2019 comments about the GOP lawsuit are woefully vague, but they can all be interpreted as tacit support. Asked about the case, a Daines spokesperson said \u201cwhatever mechanism\u201d to get rid of the ACA would do. McSally\u2019s campaign \u201cdidn\u2019t specifically answer, but pointed to her general disapproval of the ACA.\u201d Gardner avoided the question six times in one interview, but in another, he said: \u201cThat\u2019s the court\u2019s decision. If the Democrats want to stand for an unconstitutional law, I guess that\u2019s their choice.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
