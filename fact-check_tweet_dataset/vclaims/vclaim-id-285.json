The Supreme Court ruled that it is unconstitutional for civilians to be tried by military tribunals when civil courts are available ( here ). The full text of the court\u2019s decision, visible here , does not include the excerpts in the Facebook posts, and the case is not related to the authority of state or federal executives, legislators, or judges to restrict constitutional rights in times of emergency such as a pandemic.\n\nThe posts on social media also cite an alleged section of the decision - \u201cSection 98\u201d - stating that anyone who suspends or attempts to suspend rights granted in the Constitution \u201cwithin 50 independent, sovereign, continental United States of America is making war against our constitution(s) and, therefore, we the people.\u201d This quote is not found in the text of Ex parte ( here There were only 36 states in 1866, rather than 50, further hinting to the claim\u2019s fabrication ( here ).\n\nLastly, the posts claim that anyone who \u201cdeclares the suspension of constitutionally guaranteed rights\u2026 or attempts to enforce such suspension\u2026 violate(s) their constitutional oath and, thus, immediately forfeit(s) their office and authority and their proclamations may be disregarded with impunity\u2026 even the governor and President.\u201d This is false.\n\nThe Reuters Fact Check team previously debunked a false claim stating governors do not have the authority to close businesses, force residents to stay home, or shut down religious institutions here .\n\nThe Stafford Act, enacted in 1988, stipulates that only the president can declare a major disaster under the law. Visible here, the law empowers the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to assist state and local governments during \u201cnatural catastrophes\u201d and coordinate the nation\u2019s response. Accordingly, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency in response to the new coronavirus on March 13, 2020 here .\n\nThe odd syntax, the false transcription of Ex parte Milligan, and miscount of states in 1866 all support the conclusion that this viral post was fabricated. Governors and the President have acted within their legal rights in response to the new coronavirus emergency.\n\nFalse. The 1866 U.S. Supreme Case Ex parte Milligan did not involve curtailing the government\u2019s constitutional liberties during an emergency. The U.S. President has the authority to legally declare a national emergency, as do U.S. governors within their states.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
