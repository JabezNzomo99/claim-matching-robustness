It is being claimed that \u2018Indians are throwing away their idol into the river because it can\u2019t save them from COVID-19\u2019.\n\nThe caption with the video read: \u201cIndians throwing away their idol into the river because it can\u2019t deliver them from Covid-19\u201d\n\nThe video was shared with the same claim in French language as well. Such posts can be seen here and here.\n\nALSO READ: Fact Check: False claim attached to picture of a boy, half-submerged\u2026\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above video and found that the claim attached to it is FAKE.\n\nWe began our investigation by putting the video through InVid tool and then putting the extracted keyframes through Reverse Image Search. The results led us to a Facebook post with an extended version of the same video uploaded on September 29, 2015.\n\nThe caption suggested that the video is of Ganesh Visharjan, a Hindu ritual that takes place during Ganesh Chaturthi.\n\nOn digging further, we found another post with the same video dated September 24, 2015, suggesting that the video was shot at a bridge over River Krishna at NH 44 in Mehboobnagar district in Telangana.\n\nTaking a cue from the above information, we ran a search on Google maps, and we found that the bridge in the video is Beechpalli Bridge in Telangana.\n\nWe further compared the picture with keyframes of the video and the similarity confirmed that the video was indeed shot there.\n\nPutting our discoveries together, we can conclude that the video in question has no connection with the current Coronavirus crisis and the claim attached to it is FAKE as the video is at least 5-years old.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
