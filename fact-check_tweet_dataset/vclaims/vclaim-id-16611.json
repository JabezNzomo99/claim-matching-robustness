The video is BBC aerial footage of an anti-Trump protest in the UK, but it took place during his previous visit to the country, on 13 July 2018.\n\nAnother video that was widely circulated on social media claimed to show a pro-President Trump rally during the 2019 state visit. This is also wrongly identified: the video is likewise from the President\u2019s previous visit to the UK. It shows pro-Trump chanting at a \u201cFree Tommy Robinson\u201d rally that took place on 14 July 2018.\n\nThere was an anti-Trump protest in London during the state visit, on 4 June 2019, although it was smaller than the one in 2018. There were also protests in other locations around the UK, and some clashes between protesters and pro-Trump counter-protesters.", "lang": "en"}
