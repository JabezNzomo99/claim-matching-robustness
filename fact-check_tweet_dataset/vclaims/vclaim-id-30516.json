RT has been found in breach of Ofcom broadcasting codes, including those related to \u201cdue accuracy,\u201d on several occasions.\n\nIn September, 2012, Ofcom ruled that an RT news item, broadcast on August 21, 2011, had been in breach of Rule 5.1 of the Ofcom broadcasting code, with regards to due accuracy and due impartiality.\n\nThe broadcast took place as fighting was nearing a crescendo in Libya, with rebel fighters, supported by NATO air strikes, gaining the upper hand over the forces of Muammar Gaddafi. During the news segment, RT\u2019s correspondent in Tripoli, Lizzie Phelan, said the following:\n\n\u201cOf course we know that at the beginning of the crisis and continuously, the\n\ninternational media, the Western media \u2013 and Al Jazeera in particular \u2013 has [sic] been responsible for a number of really grave lies. Of course there was the lie that Gaddafi was attacking his own people, which thanks to the satellites of Russian intelligence proved that there were no such attacks from the air that took place.\u201d\n\nOfcom noted that it was well-established that the Libyan regime had conducted air strikes against civilians in rebel-held areas, with United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay condemning such attacks in April 2011.\n\nFurthermore, the Russian government itself had declined to veto Resolution 1973 [https://www.un.org/press/en/2011/sc10200.doc.htm] in the UN Security Council, which, in response to attacks on civilians by the Gaddafi regime, imposed a no-fly zone, an arms embargo, and authorized \u201call necessary means to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas.\u201d\n\nIn addition to ruling that this news segment had breached regulations with regards to due accuracy, Ofcom also found in the same report that two other RT broadcasts had breached elements of the Broadcasting Code concerning impartiality.\n\nThree years later, Ofcom ruled that a March 2014 RT broadcast -- this time an investigative program alleging that the BBC had \u201cstaged\u201d a chemical weapons attack in Syria to discredit the regime of Bashar al-Assad -- had breached Rule 2.2 of the Broadcasting Code:\n\n\u201cFactual programmes or items or portrayals of factual matters must not materially mislead the audience.\u201d\n\nWhile the Ofcom report found a myriad of failings in the program, it avoided ruling on the veracity of the chemical weapons attack described by the BBC in the report criticized by RT. It did however find that the program had deliberately misrepresented the content of a letter of complaint to the BBC from one member of the public as being the findings of a \u201cmassive public investigation.\u201d\n\nThe broadcast in question was an episode of the now-cancelled Truthseeker series, which became infamous after spreading lurid and patently false claims that Ukrainian soldiers had crucified a child in the Donbas town of Slovyansk.\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian Embassy in London has, itself, acquired a reputation for fabrication and distortion, with a rather eccentric Twitter presence that has already been the subject of two previous Polygraph.info debunkings.\n\nIt is nonetheless remarkable that on this occasion the embassy had the gall to demand not only an apology from The Times but also to suggest an intervention from the press regulator, dependent on a claim that is so easily refuted by reference to public records.", "lang": "en"}
