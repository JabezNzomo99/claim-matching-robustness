A day later, she repeated the claim on talk radio during an interview with host and specified that \"the vast majority of refugees leaving Syria are able-bodied young men.\"\n\nThat sounded like a job for PolitiFact.\n\nPreviously, PolitiFact has examined claims about Syrian refugees. In October, Donald Trump said \"there aren't that many women; there aren't that many children\" among Syrian refugees. We ranked that statement .\n\nThe United Nations keeps track of more than 4 million registered Syrian refugees, with an .\n\nLet\u2019s start by leaving out the other qualifiers \u2014 young and able-bodied \u2014 and look at whether the \"vast majority\" of refugees are men. We need not split hairs on what constitutes a \"vast majority\" here, since the gender breakdown is pretty evenly split; in hard numbers, the majority of refugees is actually female.\n\nFurther, to look at only the male refugees \u2013 which amount to 49.7 percent of the total \u2013 less than half of that population is age 18 or older. Men ages 18 to 59 comprise about 22 percent of all Syrian refugees.\n\nContrary to Fiorina\u2019s statement, most refugees overall are children age 17 or younger.\n\nGeoffrey Mock, a Syrian country specialist for Amnesty International USA, explained the situation of Syrian refugees to PolitiFact for the similar fact-check of Trump.\n\nHe said the sort of refugees Fiorina was talking about \u2013 young, able-bodied men \u2013 would be given a low priority for settling in the United States. President Obama that the country take at least 10,000 refugees in the next fiscal year.\n\nThe United Nations that the U.S. and other industrialized countries shelter 130,000 Syrian refugees over the following two years.\n\n\"The priorities go to torture survivors, people with serious medical conditions, children and teens on their own, and women and children at risk,\" Mock told PolitiFact.\n\nSelected refugees undergo screening by state agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security. The process can take years.\n\nFiorina said the \"vast majority of (Syrian) refugees are young, able-bodied men looking for work.\"\n\nShe repeated the essence of a claim that wasn\u2019t accurate a month earlier and isn\u2019t accurate today. A slight majority of Syrian refugees are female, and men age 18 to 59 comprise about 22 percent of all Syrian refugees.", "lang": "en"}
