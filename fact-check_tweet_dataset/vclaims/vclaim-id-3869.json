The EU last received 50% of the UK\u2019s exports in 2008.\n\nIt\u2019s correct to say, as the BBC\u2019s Justin Webb did yesterday, that trade patterns seem to be shifting. While the EU remains our largest market by some distance, over time we\u2019re selling less to the EU and more to other economies as a proportion of total trade.\n\nAround 44% of exports went to the EU in 2014\n\nIn 2014, British companies sold around \u00a3515 billion worth of goods and services to foreign buyers, according to the Office for National Statistics. \u00a3229 billion of those earnings came from the European Union\u2014so 44%, not 50%.\n\nIt would be 50% if you were looking only at goods exports, and excluding services.\n\nBut there are good reasons to take Lord Rose as meaning all exports. The Stronger In campaign that he leads has previously told us that it means goods and services when making this claim. Ignoring services would also exclude over 40% of the UK\u2019s total exports.\n\nThe figure of 8% of all exports going to the BRICS countries is correct.\n\n50% would have been right a few years ago, but we\u2019re doing more business outside the EU\n\nTo say that 50% of British exports go to the EU would have been correct as recently as 2008. But the proportion has fallen below half over the past few years. The absolute amount of exports earnings has also fallen slightly, from \u00a3242 billion in 2011 to \u00a3229 billion in 2014. And that doesn\u2019t account for inflation.\n\nMeanwhile, exports to the BRICS have risen from around 5% of the total a decade ago to 8% in 2014. That would be 10% if you included exports to Hong Kong, which isn\u2019t considered part of China in these statistics.\n\nLord Rose is right that the 27 other countries of the EU, taken as a group, remain by some distance our largest market.\n\nThe next biggest market, the United States, took 17% of our exports in 2014.\n\nWere these actually exports to the EU?\n\nIt\u2019s sometimes argued that these statistics overstate the proportion of UK exports that go to the EU, as a lot of goods pass through ports like Rotterdam before being shipped to a final destination outside the EU.\n\nBoth the ONS and the government's review of our EU membership have concluded that it's hard to quantify the extent of this \u2018Rotterdam effect\u2019 or establish whether it's a serious problem for the statistics.", "lang": "en"}
