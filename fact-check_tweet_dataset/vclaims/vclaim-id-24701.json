The video is originally from London and is from 2014, The Quint has found.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND OUT?\n\nBy running a reverse search on one of the key-frames from the video, it was ascertained that the video is that of a protest that was staged in London in 2014.\n\nAccording to Huffington Post, the video actually shows Kurdish protestors who staged a slave trade auction to \"show the reality of IS's slave trade of captured women in Syria and Iraq.\"\n\nSpeaking to Newsweek, one of protestors said the protest was intended to provoke an \u201caggravated reaction, highlighting the crimes ISIS are committing in Iraq and Syria.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we wanted to show is that this could take place in London,\u201d he told NewsWeek.\n\nIncidentally, British political party Britain First had shared the video on its Facebook page with the misleading caption: \"London Muslims auctioning women on the streets of our capital\", in 2016. The video was then debunked by Snopes.", "lang": "en"}
