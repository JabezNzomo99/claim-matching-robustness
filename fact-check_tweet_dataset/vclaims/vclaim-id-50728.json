The audio in the post narrates the story behind the visuals. While the video was uploaded six months back, it is being widely shared now and the post has received more than six thousand shares. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Video shows Muslims thrashed by Hindus at Baruasagar in Jhansi District (UP). Fact: The lady in the video was beaten up by her husband for questioning his extra-marital affair. The incident took place in Telangana, not in Uttar Pradesh. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through Google Reverse Image Search, it was found that the lady in the video was beaten up by her husband for questing his extra-marital affair. The same video was uploaded by \u2018The Times of India\u2019 on YouTube with the title, \u201cCaught on cam: Telangana Sub-Inspector beats wife, baby, mother-in-law\u201d. Also, the incident took place in Telangana, not in Uttar Pradesh.\n\n\n\nThe same video was also previously shared with another claim. FACTLY\u2019s fact-check article on that false claim can be read here. \n\n\n\nTo sum it up, a domestic violence incident from Telangana is being shared as a communal incident in UP.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Indian Rivers?", "lang": "en"}
