It shows three men opening a Starbucks door to reveal what appears to be Shepard Fairey-style images of Trump as the welcome mat (the site added an arrow to point it out).\n\nThe post redirects from a DepartedMedia.com address that Facebook flagged as potentially being made up, as part of the social media giant\u2019s efforts to identify fake news. DepartedMedia.com is a site known for sharing fake news. The site is registered to an address in Chesterbrook, Pa.\n\nThe image has been doctored, with Trump\u2019s photo added after the fact. It comes from a Twitter account called @TrumpThe45th, which is associated with the websites. The account tweeted out the photo the same day as the Internet post.\n\nThere has been a strong conservative backlash against the Seattle-based coffee purveyor recently, especially after the company announced it would hire 10,000 refugees over five years following Trump\u2019s controversial travel ban. But despite being picked up by several other websites across the Internet, the image and its implications are a Trenta-sized fabrication.\n\nThe picture is of a Starbucks, all right, but it was taken in March 2014, when a THIRD Starbucks opened in Downtown Disney at Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif. Trump hadn\u2019t even announced his presidential campaign at the time. There are no photos on the floor, of Trump or anyone else.\n\nThe original image came from a photo of a Starbucks opening in March 2014 at Downtown Disney in Anaheim, Calif., as posted on InsideTheMagic.net.\n\nJudging by the comments on the tweet and the Internet ubiquity of the photo, plenty of people were fooled by the visual chicanery. We didn\u2019t hear back from DepartedMedia.com when we contacted them, but it\u2019s clear the image is intentionally fabricated.\n\nWe rate this claim a full-bodied Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
