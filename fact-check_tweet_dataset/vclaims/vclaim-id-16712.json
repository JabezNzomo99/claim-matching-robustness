The story also accuses Obama of making prayer rugs available in order to make Muslims more comfortable. However, it says, President-elect Donald Trump put a stop to the practice and ordered \u201call pagan symbols\u201d to be removed from the property:\n\nObama was seen storming away from the West Wing after staffers from Donald Trump\u2019s transition team began preparing the Executive offices for the new administration. On Trump\u2019s orders, one of Obama\u2019s most secretive rituals is being reversed and all signs of it removed from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nTo further its spurious claim, this story features a photo of Muslim men in prayer, suggesting that it was taken as part of this \u201csecret\u201d ritual. The picture was taken at the White House \u2014 by attorney Qasim Rashid \u2014 but the prayer was actually part of a special event in July 2016:\n\nThe allegation about the prayer rug is similar to a thoroughly debunked claim that Obama had a \u201cMuslim prayer curtain\u201d put in the White House. Obama has also been (falsely) accused of \u201cenforcing\u201d Islamic prayers on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, and cancelling the National Day of Prayer.\n\nThe site presents itself as a conservative-oriented news site, failing to mention its hard-to-find disclaimer:\n\nThe site also falsely claims that comedian Rosie O\u2019Donnell was detained by the Secret Service for threatening Trump on Twitter, and that Obama \u201cbanned\u201d Baby Jesus\u201d from the White House.", "lang": "en"}
