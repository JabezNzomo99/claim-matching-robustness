Those are the things I find most important in deciding where to live.\"\n\nCasselberry is a real city, located ten miles north of downtown Orlando. But it isn't the Oscar winner\u2019s new hometown.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time DiCaprio is quoted as saying this, though, nor is Casselberry the celebrity\u2019s only alleged haven from the L.A. lifestyle. Fake news sites have announced DiCaprio\u2019s moves to Gilroy, Calif., Woodstock, Ill., Temple, Ariz., Warren, Mich., Swedesboro, N.J., and even to small towns overseas, including Naas in Ireland and Guilford in England.\n\nThe stories appear on a chain of websites that seem to bank on readers clicking on particular versions of the post to generate advertising revenue. The sites\u2019 names sound like official media outlets, like \"WCRK 35\" or \"Q 102.\"\n\nThe sites are also known for including various versions of stories that falsely claim an event has happened. We previously debunked a fake news story that celebrities\u2019 cars were breaking down in small towns.\n\nEvery version of these stories is almost identical, though, with a different town name.The other element that sometimes changes is the name of the celebrity leaving L.A. in search of \"good, decent people\" who care about their community.\n\nIf you believe these Internet rumors, you will find that Will Ferrell is moving to Yuba City, Calif.; Ben Affleck to Delray Beach, Fla.; Miley Cyrus to Sedalia, Mo.; Eminem to Rocklin, Calif.; Scarlett Johansson to Clovis, Calif.; Matt Damon to Missoula, Mont.; and Bill Murray to Salisbury, Mass.\n\nNeedless to say, there is no evidence any of these celebs are packing their bags and heading to your suburb any time soon.\n\nAlthough there is no banner on this or any of the other posts announcing they are fake, a disclaimer on the website announces that kbr31.com is a satirical and fantasy website.\n\n\"None of the articles on kbr31.com should be considered true and are simply works of satire or fantasy meant for entertainment purposes,\" the disclaimer said. \"The satirical and fantasy articles on kbr31.com poke fun at our celebrity obsessed cultures and the politically correct world we\u2019re forced to live in.\"\n\nThe listed email address provided no response to our request for comment on the fake story.\n\nWe rate this statement Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
