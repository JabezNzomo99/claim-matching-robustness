President Donald Trump has been calling for reduction of corporate taxes. This is something he talked about when visiting Missouri in August. However, income tax is a hot button topic in Missouri as well. State Sen. Andrew Koenig, R-Manchester, boasted on Twitter that a law he helped pass would be the first cut to Missouri income tax in over a century. \"The bill that I carried cutting MO\u2019s income tax for 1st time in over 100 years will start its 1st phase in jan 1 2018,\" the senator tweeted on Aug. 30, 2017, with the hashtag \"moleg\" and tagging Missouri State Treasurer Eric Schmitt. Over a century? This seemed a little bit out there. When Koenig\u2019s office did not answer our inquiry, we started digging for ourselves.\n\nTo trigger the start of the law, the state\u2019s gross income had to exceed income in one of the three previous years by $150 million. That happened in the last fiscal year, so now the bill will go into effect on Jan. 1, 2018.\n\nThe prospect of decreasing income tax is appealing for taxpayers, but is this really the first time it is happening in over a century?\n\nMissouri income tax was established in 1917. This tax was for a half of a percent annually on individuals\u2019 income. Income tax saw revisions throughout the years. Graduated tax brackets were created in 1939 and have not been changed since 1972. The limit for deduction for federal income taxes was created in 1993. There were various other revisions and adjustments as well.\n\nFor a century, tax law has been growing into what income tax looks like today. Why has there always been an increase and never a decrease?\n\nThe half-percentage reduction of the tax rate per year gives the state legislature some time to adjust to having less revenue for the budget. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a more immediate impact for individuals: Tax brackets will now be adjusted annually based on percent increase in inflation.\n\nAnd while Koenig is correct that the state\u2019s income rate has never decreased, it\u2019s important to note that the legislature has enacted many income tax deductions that have the same effect of lowering someone\u2019s state income tax bill. Beginning in 2016, for example, 100 percent of a military pension income became exempt from Missouri state tax. The state also created a new deduction for people from Missouri who relocated a business to Missouri.\n\nKoenig said that Senate Bill 509 would cut Missouri income tax for the first time in over 100 years. The truth of the matter is Missouri income tax has never been cut. Income tax laws were put in place in 1917. This was 100 years ago exactly. It\u2019s not over 100 years, but Koenig was pretty close.", "lang": "en"}
