A barrage of local headlines also\n\nwent with \u201cNigerian universities\u2019 scientists discover vaccine for Covid-19\u201d.\n\nThere has been\n\nin the country that Africa\u2019s largest economy has been reduced to a bystander in the global search for ways to counter the pandemic.\n\nin the hunt for a vaccine?\n\nThe story stems from a news conference called on 19 June by a group of scientists based in Nigerian universities. It was widely reported that they said they had\n\nA vaccine is a biological preparation that helps the body\u2019s immune system\n\nThe leader of the research team, Dr Oladipo Kolawole of\n\nin Osun state, reportedly said the vaccine, while developed in Africa for Africa, would work anywhere.\n\nWhile the news headlines played up the discovery of a functional vaccine, the articles themselves suggested it was still work in progress.\n\nWe therefore asked Kolawole what exactly his team had done.\n\n\u201cWe referred to the news as a potential vaccine candidate, not a vaccine. Those who referred to it as a vaccine chose to do what they wanted to do,\u201d he told us.\n\n, said the group had explored the SARS-CoV-2 genome from African countries to select the best possible vaccine.\n\nSARS-CoV-2, or \u201csevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\u201d, is the technical name of the virus that causes Covid-19.\n\nof the coronavirus strain in the country\u2019s first confirmed case. They found it to be a match with the virus circulating in Italy and Wuhan, China, the health agency said, adding that this was the first time the virus had been sequenced in Africa.\n\nrefers to investigating the genetic make-up of an organism.\n\nKolawole was also reported as saying it would take a minimum of 18 months before the vaccine could be unveiled to the public.\n\nHe told Africa Check that \u201c[the potential vaccine] has to undergo a lot of test trials before you can conclude finally that it is a vaccine. There are a lot of tests to be conducted in animals, humans, and approval from authorities\u201d.\n\nProfessor of virology and former president of the\n\n, Oyewale Tomori, told Africa Check that the researchers may have been too hasty in calling the press conference as it could lead to the spread of misinformation.\n\n\u201cIt is not correct to say we have found a vaccine, instead it should be called a candidate vaccine. To say we have found a vaccine means you have already tested it and confirmed that it is good. If you called it a candidate vaccine, that would have been correct,\u201d Tomori said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s centre for disease control told Africa Check it had not received an official notice of a locally produced vaccine.\n\n\u201cScientific innovations are best announced through peer reviewed scientific publications in reputable journals, not via unvalidated press releases,\u201d said Chinwe Ochu, the head of prevention programmes and knowledge management at the agency.\n\n\u201cAs much as NCDC will be happy to receive health innovations to support the public health response, such products must follow standard scientific protocols for scrutiny and validation to ensure they are effective and safe.\u201d\n\nConclusion: Still long way for Nigeria in search for Covid-19 vaccine\n\nSeveral media publications reported in late June 2020 that Nigerian scientists had unveiled a vaccine for the new coronavirus.\n\nBut the researchers said what they had was a potential vaccine candidate, and it would be months before it could be said to be effective. The country\u2019s NCDC also said it has no knowledge yet of a functional vaccine.\n\nIf confirmed as a candidate, it would join the ranks of tens of others that are in various phases of development.", "lang": "en"}
