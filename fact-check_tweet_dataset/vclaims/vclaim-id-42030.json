No such amendment exists.\n\nThe Constitution provides a framework for the federal government and guarantees certain basic rights to U.S. citizens. To date, it has 27 amendments.\n\nYet, while the Constitution\u2019s 27 amendments are clearly enumerated, a viral Facebook post alleges in an image that there is a \u201c28th Amendment\u201d barring Congress from making laws that do not apply equally to both citizens and legislators. The text of this \u201c28th Amendment\u201d has been circulating on various platforms since at least 2010, according to FactCheck.org.\n\n\u201cCongress shall make no law that applies to the citizens of the United States that does not apply equally to the Senators and Representatives,\u201d reads the bogus amendment. \u201cAnd, Congress shall make no law that applies to the Senators and Representatives that does not apply equally to the Citizens of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe most recent amendment to the Constitution stipulates that any change in pay for members of the House and Senate cannot take effect \u201cuntil an election of representatives shall have intervened.\u201d It was ratified in 1992, according to the National Constitution Center.\n\nSome lawmakers have proposed amendments similar to the one in the Facebook post, but they have never been ratified.

Rand Paul introduced a joint resolution \u201crelative to applying laws equally to the citizens of the United States and the Federal Government\u201d in 2013. The resolution died in committee that year and again in 2015, when he reintroduced it.\n\nSimilar amendments introduced in the House around the same time also failed to gain traction.", "lang": "en"}
