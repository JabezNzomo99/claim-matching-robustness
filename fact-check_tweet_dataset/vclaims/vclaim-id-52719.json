As of writing, it had over 10,000 shares, 1,000 reactions, and 729 comments. Claim Check, Facebook\u2019s monitoring tool, flagged the post for verification.\n\nThe facts: Senators, as part of Congress, are tasked to craft laws and legislate them. The senators mentioned in the graphic have responded to the coronavirus crisis by doing so. Some of them have also publicly shared that they provided aid to frontliners and communities affected by the enhanced community quarantine.\n\nOn March 23, all senators, except Hontiveros, voted in favor of the passing of Republic Act 11469 or Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, which grants President Rodrigo Duterte 30 special powers to address the growing number of coronavirus cases in the country. Hontiveros argued that the law is prone to abuse.\n\nStill, Hontiveros filed Senate Bill No. 1441 or the Balik Trabahong Ligtas Act on April 30, which seeks to provide mandatory life and additional health insurance for all workers during health emergencies.\n\nPoe and Villar, too, have initiated projects to distribute medical supplies and personal protective equipment to various hospitals in the country. Poe, Villar, and Hontiveros also donated food supplies to health workers and vulnerable families.\n\nAs of Monday, May 4, a total of 9,485 cases of COVID-19 were recorded in the Philippines. Of this, 623 died and 1,315 recovered. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
