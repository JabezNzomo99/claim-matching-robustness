He had 8 years to prepair the next president for a pandemic and he failed. I have done a tremendous job. There are still more people alive then dead!\u201d the tweet read.\n\nAlthough Trump and other Republicans have (falsely) criticized the Obama administration for supposedly not leaving behind a pandemic playbook, this image did not capture a genuine Trump tweet. No such tweet exists on the timeline of the @RealDonaldTrump Twitter account, and neither the Factbase or Politiwoops databases, which archive tweets by public officials (including deleted tweets), has captured any such matching tweet.", "lang": "en"}
