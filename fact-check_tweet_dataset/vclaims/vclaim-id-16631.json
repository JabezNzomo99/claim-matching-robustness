To put that in perspective, I think Victoria\u2019s growing by 10,000 people every 26 days.\u201d\n\nPremier Steven Marshall said South Australia needed more people to address a skills shortage that\u2019s negatively impacting the state\u2019s economy. [1]\n\nTo help address the problem his government had signed up to a $19.4 million federal government plan offering migrant workers jobs and residency in regional areas. The Designated Area Migration Agreements plan allows regional employers to sponsor overseas workers into positions they were unable to fill with locals. [2]\n\nThe new federal cities, urban infrastructure and population Minister Alan Tudge said five regional areas - south-west Victoria, Adelaide, regional SA, far-north Queensland and Kalgoorlie-Boulder would benefit from the Designated Area Migration Agreements plan. Mr Tudge said the plan was designed to take population pressures off the east coast by putting more skilled migrants into the regions. [3]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined Premier Marshall\u2019s claim that South Australia\u2019s population was growing by around 10,000 people per year and that equated to the growth Victoria experienced every 26 days.\n\nAccording to the most recent data published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, SA\u2019s population grew by a total of 65,215 people across five calendar years from 2013-2017. This five-year total figure of 65,215 was calculated using the following SA population growth figures from the ABS: 14,970 in 2013, 15,055 in 2014, 12,803 in 2015, 11,463 in 2016 and 10,924 in 2017. On average across those five years, South Australia\u2019s population grew by 13,043 per year, which is above the figure of 10,000 quoted by the SA premier. [4]\n\nOver the same five-year period of 2013-2017, Victoria\u2019s population grew by 677,019, according to ABS data and the average population growth for the state was 135,404. Based on these figures Victoria\u2019s population grew on average by 371 people per day, 9,646 people over 26 days and 10,017 over 27 days. SA\u2019s five-year average of 13,043 people would be surpassed by Victoria\u2019s growth after just 36 days with growth of 13,356. [4]\n\nLooking solely at figures from the last calendar year of 2017 when data was available, Victoria\u2019s population grew more than 10 times faster than SA. Year-on-year Victoria\u2019s population rose by 141,742 or 10,097 in 26 days. Based on these 2017 figures Victoria\u2019s population growth would surpass SA actual population growth of 10,924 for the whole year on the 29th day, when there would have been growth of 11,262 people.\n\nBased on this data AAP FactCheck concludes that Mr Marshall\u2019s claim that SA\u2019s average annual population growth equates to Victoria\u2019s population growth in 26 days is mostly true. The premier\u2019s calculations appear to be based on 2017 figures when SA\u2019s average population growth was 10,924 and Victoria\u2019s average for 29 days. Mr Marshall said 10,000 people every 26 days.", "lang": "en"}
