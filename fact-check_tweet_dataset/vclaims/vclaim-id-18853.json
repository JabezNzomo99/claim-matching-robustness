Eventually over 300 starlings were found dead.\n\nResearchers at the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam and Wageningen University did autopsies on 15 of the starlings. From the birds\u2019 internal injuries, the researchers concluded that they had probably died from hitting objects (possibly the ground, tree branches or each other) at great force.\n\nThe exact reason why the birds hit the objects is not known, but the university suggested that it may have been caused by panic due to a hunting owl or another disturbance.\n\nThe university confirmed that the official cause of death was bleeding as a result of trauma, but that tests also found traces of a toxin from the seeds of a berry starlings are known to eat. But it\u2019s not known if the toxins played a part in their death.\n\nThe bird deaths had nothing to do with 5G\n\nThe Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy told us that there were no 5G tests in October 2018 in The Hague.\n\nThe Dutch government\u2019s antenna information office confirmed there had been no 5G tests in the vicinity of the park.\n\nWe know that at least one 5G demonstration did take place in the Hague before this, for a single day in June 2018, in an office around half an hour\u2019s walk from the park.\n\nLarge groups of starlings dying in this way is not unusual\n\nIn 2010, 75 starlings crash landed in a small area in Somerset. The RSPCA said its guess was that the birds had died trying to escape a predator. Such incidents are monitored in the UK to check for outbreaks of avian disease. Around 5,000 starlings and blackbirds were found dead in Arkansas in 2010, and was not seen as \u201cthat unusual\u201d by authorities.\n\n5G is the next generation of wireless network technology, following on from 4G. One of the many uses of this will be to provide faster web access from mobiles, for more devices at once.\n\nHigher-frequency waves, like X-rays, gamma rays and UV rays, are ionising, meaning they can damage DNA in human cells\u2014which is why they are thought to cause cancer at certain doses. But lower-frequency waves, like the radio waves coming from mobiles, are non-ionising radiation, meaning they don\u2019t damage DNA inside cells. The NHS says most current research suggests \u201cit's unlikely that radio waves from mobile phones or base stations increase the risk of any health problems.\u201d\n\nPublic Health England says that exposure of the general public to radio waves from existing telecoms networks are within international guideline levels and that those guidelines will continue to apply to 5G products.\n\nAn international organisation that provides scientific advice and guidance on non-ionising radiation (like the radio waves of 5G) has guidelines on safe levels of exposure. Public Health England has said that these guidelines should be adopted, and that there\u2019s no \u201cconvincing evidence\u201d that exposure below these guidelines can cause adverse health effects. These guidelines go up to 300GHz, whereas the maximum for 5G will probably only be in the tens of GHz.", "lang": "en"}
