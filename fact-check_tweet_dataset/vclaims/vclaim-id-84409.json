The photo was taken during the funeral of freedom fighter Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan, in Peshwar on January 21, 1988. Old news reports from the New York Times and LA Times also mentions that Rajiv Gandhi attended the funeral along with a few members of his cabinet and family. BOOM was the first website to debunk the viral photo when it was shared with a misleading claim in February this year.", "lang": "en"}
