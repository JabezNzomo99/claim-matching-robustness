We have a tremendous testing setup where people coming in have to be tested.\u201d\n\nHe continued to say that anyone who does test positive won\u2019t be sent away, but that they will, instead, be quarantined.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a pretty strong enforcement of quarantine.\u201d\n\nWhile the CDC now has offices and quarantine stations at 20 airports in the United States\u2014including O\u2019Hare International Airport, Dulles International Airport, and other major hubs of international travel\u2014only travelers from Iran and China are consistently being screened. Per the CDC website: \u201cAmerican citizens, lawful permanent residents, and their families who have been in China or Iran in the past 14 days will be allowed to enter the United States, but will be redirected to one of 11 airports to undergo health screening.\u201d\n\nThis screening does not consist of an actual test for the virus. Instead travelers \u201cwill be screened for fever, cough, or trouble breathing.\u201d\n\nAny traveler displaying symptoms will be taken to a medical facility for further evaluation. Even travelers who do not display symptoms but have been in the Hubei Province, where the virus originated, will be quarantined for 14 days. Asymptomatic travelers who have traveled elsewhere in China are free to carry out their journey but are informed of symptoms to keep an eye out for and are asked to stay at home as much as possible, since symptoms for the coronavirus don\u2019t typically appear until five days after contracting the virus and an incubation period of up to 14 days is possible.\n\nSome individuals with coronavirus will never display any symptoms, and asymptomatic transmission is possible.\n\nThe CDC says that travelers from Europe, Iran, and South Korea \u201cmust stay home for 14 days after returning from travel, monitor their health, and practice social distancing.\u201d\n\nFollowing the president\u2019s announcement that travel from Europe would be limited, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Acting Director Chad Wolf issued a statement in which he said American citizens returning from European countries will be required \u201cto travel through select airports where the U.S. Government has implemented enhanced screening procedures.\u201d\n\nMarc Lipsitch, head of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health\u2019s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, said earlier this week that most countries\u2019 screenings are too lax and could miss up to two-thirds of coronavirus cases entering their borders.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin recently wrote a letter to the CDC asking for increased airport testings, pointing out instances of Americans returning from Italy and not being screened at the airport or quarantined, despite the high prevalence of the virus in Italy. Sen. Durbin also noted that travelers returning from South Korea, another coronavirus hotbed, are not being tested.\n\nAnd there have been numerous reports of travelers themselves describing their experiences in recent days, returning to the U.S. and being admitted without any testing. Vice News producer Julia Lindau tweeted last week that she had returned to the United States from the epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic in Italy and faced no screening.\n\nMike McIntire, an investigative reporter for the New York Times, shared that he faced \u201czero screening, testing or even questions related to coronavirus\u201d when he returned from Paris on Thursday.\n\nNancy Stone, a former photographer for the Chicago Tribune, said she had a similarly easy time getting through customs at Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport on her return trip from Madrid the same day.\n\nThe president\u2019s claim that travelers entering the United States are required to undergo coronavirus testing\u2014very heavily or otherwise\u2014is false.\n\nPhotograph of international travelers arriving at LAX before the travel ban from Europe sets in by Photo by Frederic J.
