The correct figure is 46%, according to the latest available data for 2019.\n\nThe Express misquotes figures claimed in a recent news release by Facts4EU, which is a pro-Brexit news site. Facts4EU actually said:\n\n\u201cMost people know that about 46% of UK goods exports go to the EU\u2026 What people weren't told until now is that this is only 7.7% of GDP\u201d.\n\nBoth of these figures are accurate. Goods exports to the EU were worth \u00a3170 billion in 2019, 46% of the UK\u2019s total of \u00a3370 billion worth of goods exports. UK GDP in 2019 was about \u00a32.2 trillion (\u00a32,200 billion), so goods exported to the EU account for 7.7% of that.\n\nThe 46% figure is lower than in previous years, when around half of the UK\u2019s goods exports normally went to the EU. Counting services exports as well, 43% of the UK\u2019s goods and services exports went to the EU in 2019.", "lang": "en"}
