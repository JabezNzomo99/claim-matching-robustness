The House of Representatives\u2019 deliberations on the network\u2019s application for its legislative franchise were only postponed by a week \u2014 from June 22 to 29 \u2014 and have since resumed.\n\nThis was not made clear in the two YouTube channels\u2019 headlines, which read, \u201cBREAKING NEWS: FRANCHISE HEARING ng ABSCBN KUMPIRMADONG KANSELADO NA dahil sa LACK OF DOCUMENTS (ABS-CBN\u2019s franchise hearing confirmed to be cancelled due to a lack of documents)!!!\u201d\n\nIn an attempt to cite a legitimate source, Showbiz Fanaticz and SHOWBIZNEWS PINAS used a June 22 Inquirer.net article.\n\nHowever, Inquirer.net and several other media outlets, quoting House Committee on Legislative Franchises chair Rep. Franz Alvarez, reported that the proceedings were only postponed to another date -- June 29 -- in order for ABS-CBN and other concerned agencies to submit documents requested by Congress, and to give time for the House committees involved to study it.\n\nThe deceptive uploads, which had identical scripts read by different narrators, surfaced as the media giant continued to face uncertainties regarding its comeback on air.\n\nAfter its 25-year operational license expired on May 4, the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) issued a cease and desist order against ABS-CBN\u2019s broadcasting operations.\n\nDuring the June 29 resumption of the House hearings on the franchise, NTC vowed to issue another cease and desist notice to stop the network\u2019s broadcasting via its digital service TV Plus, which airs shows through Channel 43, claimed by the agency to be also included in its earlier shut down order. The frequency is owned by a former ABS-CBN affiliate, Amcara Broadcasting Network.\n\nShowbiz Fanaticz and SHOWBIZNEWS PINAS\u2019 videos have accumulated a combined total of over 153,000 views from netizens. Showbiz Fanaticz\u2019s video was also reposted on website kidstva.com.\n\nSocial media tool CrowdTangle shows that top traffic generators of Showbiz Fanaticz\u2019s video are FB pages Philippines trendinh news and Duterte News, as well as public group PRESIDENT RODRIGO DUTERTE INTERNATIONAL MOVEMENT.\n\nShowbiz Fanaticz, which has a history of purveying false and misleading information online, was created in November 2017. SHOWBIZNEWS PINAS, on the other hand, was made just last March 17.", "lang": "en"}
