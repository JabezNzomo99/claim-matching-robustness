The tweet is from the Twitter handle \u2013 \u2018@0Nita_ji\u2019 and has a profile picture of Reliance Foundation Chairperson Nita Ambani. In the tweet, the Congress party is criticized for its suggestion to the government to borrow gold from the religious trusts. Also, as a counter, she suggested that the government must sell the land enclosing three graves of Nehru\u2019s family members to improve the economic situation in the country. But FACTLY has found the Twitter handle \u2013 \u2018@0Nita_ji\u2019 to be a fan-page of Nita Ambani. When searched if Nita Ambani has an official account on Twitter, it was found that she does not have an official Twitter account. So, Nita Ambani did not tweet what is being shared and it is from a fan-page. Earlier, when screenshots of multiple tweets went viral on the name Nita Ambani, FACTLY has debunked them and those fact-checks can be read here, here and here.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
