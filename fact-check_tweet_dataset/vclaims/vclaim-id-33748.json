Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: \u2018Eupatorium Perfoliatum 200 CH\u2019 medicine can cure Dengue in just two days. Fact: While it is true that homeopathic medicine \u2013 \u2018Eupatorium Perfoliatum 200 CH\u2019 can be prescribed for Dengue fever, there is no credible information to prove that it can cure Dengue in just two days. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nWhen searched about \u2018Eupatorium Perfoliatum 200 CH\u2019 on Google, it was found on the \u20181mg\u2019 medical website that \u2018Eupatorium Perfoliatum 200 CH\u2019 is \u2018an effective medicine for treating fevers of Malaria and Dengue\u2019. \n\n\n\nAlso, on the government website (\u2018Vikaspedia\u2019), it can be read that it is prescribed for classical dengue fevers for some indications. The indications for suggesting \u2018Eupatorium Perfoliatum\u2019 can be seen here.\n\nIt can be found on the government website and in the newspaper articles that \u2018Eupatorium perfoliatum\u2019 can be also used as a dengue preventive medicine. But, it was also mentioned that \u2018further research in this area is being undertaken\u2019.\n\nWhile it is true that homeopathic medicine \u2013 \u2018Eupatorium Perfoliatum 200 CH\u2019 can be prescribed for Dengue fever, there is no information about it being able to cure Dengue in just two days. Also, according to a doctor on the \u2018Practo\u2019 website, \u201cEupatorium is the single most commonly indicated medicine that matches symptoms of the Dengue fever, it is not the only medicine. It forms a part of the prescription that is given to the patient along with other indicated medication selected after taking up the symptoms of the case.\u201d\n\nThere is no specific treatment for Dengue. The patients are prescribed medicines only for their symptoms. All the major hospitals (Fortis, Apollo and Yashoda) and CDC-America mention the same on their websites.\n\nAccording to the reports published by the Government of India and the World Health Organization, Dengue (Febrile Phase) lasts upto 2 to 7 days. To clear the doubts of people regarding the Dengue, the Delhi government has released a document, which can be read here.\n\nTo sum it up, \u2018Eupatorium Perfoliatum 200 CH\u2019 cannot cure Dengue in just 2 days.
