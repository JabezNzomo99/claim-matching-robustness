They revealed no evidence publicly.\n\n\u201cOne of the lines of inquiry is [Magnitsky] was poisoned with chemical agents used for sabotage. These substances contain an aluminum compound. They caused acute liver failure that looked like death by natural causes,\" Mikhail Alexandrov, a spokesman for the Russian Prosecutor General\u2019s Office said without evidence. \"When he received from Magnitsky a false statement of provocative nature, Browder was interested in his death more than anybody else.\"\n\nAlexandrov\u2019s claim that Browder had the most to benefit from Magnistky\u2019s death is not new. Russian businessman Dmitry Klyuev, who has also been implicated in Magnitsky\u2019s death, has also attempted to deflect blame to Browder.\n\nRegarding the alleged poisoning, Alexandrov said \"forensic examination\u201d of biological samples taken from the four men made it possible to conclude that they \u201chad symptoms of chronic poisoning with toxic, soluble inorganic substances introduced into their bodies.\"\n\nAlexandrov said no detailed toxicological analysis had thus far been carried out, claiming toxicological research into aluminum compounds have been carried out for several decades only at research centers in a few countries, including the United States, France and Italy.\n\n\"Such compounds can be made only in special laboratories,\" he claimed.\n\nFurther details of the nature of these compounds purportedly found nine years after Magnitsky\u2019s death in a Russian prison were not provided.\n\nWhen reached for comment, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said it had \u201cno information\u201d about \"aluminum compounds,\" but otherwise did not comment on statements made by officials of OPCW States Parties.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not comment.\n\nIn any case, Russian officials apparently did not charge Browder with alleged poisoning of those four individuals.\n\nAccording to the Russian Legal Information Agency (RAPSI), a new criminal case has been opened against Browder only on suspicion of organizing a criminal network.\n\nA report by RT stated that that charge falls under the auspices of \u201ca UN convention,\u201d without detailing which UN convention, adding: \u201cThis implies extradition of a criminal even if Russia does not have a bilateral treaty on the matter with a country he is arrested in.\u201d\n\nMoscow\u2019s efforts to boost its chances of extraditing Browder follow reports that Alexander Prokopchuk, a former Russian Interior Ministry major-general, is in the running to become the new chief at the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL).\n\nIn May, Browder was arrested in Madrid, Spain after Russia issued an international arrest warrant through Interpol.\n\nHe was later released after Spanish National Police recognized the \u201carrest warrant wasn\u2019t valid.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Browder told The Atlantic magazine that Russia had tried to issue six INTERPOL red notices for him, \u201call of them ultimately rejected as abusive.\u201d\n\nBrowder was once considered the largest foreign investor in the Russian stock market and a supporter of Putin. He was first blacklisted from Russia in 2005 for being an alleged \u201cthreat to national security.\u201d His fund, Hermitage, subsequently closed its Moscow operations. Browder later charged that a cabal of corrupt Russian officials, using materials seized during police raids, took possession of three Hermitage companies in Russia, after which the officials fraudulently claimed $230 million that Hermitage had paid in taxes. That tax refund, the largest in Russian history, was approved in under 24 hours and paid out the following day.\n\nThe investigation of those moves against Hermitage was spearheaded by Magnitsky, an auditor from the Moscow-based law firm Firestone Duncan. Hermitage would go on to file 35 complaints against those implicated in the fraud case.\n\nBut in January 2008, Magnitsky himself was arrested after arriving to provide evidence to the prosecutor overseeing that case.\n\nMagnitsky would go on to spend 11 months in pre-trial detention, where he was beaten and denied medical care after developing a host of medical conditions due to inhumane treatment.\n\nAmnesty International reported Magnitsky was \u201cneglected\u201d in Russian prison, and shortly before his death was transferred to a detention facility with a hospital, where he was \u201chandcuffed and beaten with rubber batons\u201d on the day he died.\n\nThe Russian record following Magnitsky is long and winding. This latest claim that Magnitsky was poisoned contradicts Russia\u2019s previous claims regarding his death.\n\nRussian authorities refused to release Magnitsky\u2019s body for an independent autopsy, first claiming he died of a rupture to his abdominal membrane \u2013 which would have been consistent with pancreatitis, a condition Magnitsky developed in prison. As a result, authorities then claimed he died of a heart attack.\n\nWhen Dmitri Kratov, the former head of the medical service at Butyrka Prison, was tried for negligence in Magnitsky\u2019s death, President Putin said during a December 20, 2012 press conference, before that trial\u2019s conclusion: \u201cI do not know the details, but I am still aware that Mr Magnitsky died, died not from torture, no one tortured him, but from a heart attack.\u201d\n\nBut prior to his death, Alexandra Gaus, a surgeon at the Matrosskaya Tishina Detention Center, where Magnitsky was transferred before his death, confirmed that Magnitsky was in fact suffering from acute pancreatitis. Once his health started deteriorating rapidly, Magnitsky complained: \u201cThey will kill me here. I am innocent under this case, why did they bring me here?\u201d\n\nAs a result, Gaus also diagnosed the dying man as suffering from \u201cacute psychosis,\u201d a condition which was later noted on his preliminary death certificate.\n\nThat document also stated he died from gall stones, pancreatitis, and potentially pancreatic necrosis and closed cerebral cranial injury. Mention of closed cerebral cranial injury would later be removed from that document without explanation.\n\nA 2011 report from the Russian President\u2019s Human Rights Council further found there was reasonable suspicion that Magnitsky\u2019s death had been triggered by a beating.\n\nIn October 2012, Physicians for Human Rights prepared an expert report on the available medical evidence. The conclusions of that report were damning, that he was denied medical evaluations\u201d and his eventual resuscitation was not timely and possibly peformed incorrectly.\n\n\u201cThe neglect was calculated, deliberate and inhumane,\u201d the physicians group\u2019s report stated pointedly.\n\nTwenty prison officials were reportedly sacked in relation to the case, with then-Russian president Dmitry Medvedev firing Alexander Piskunov, deputy head of the Federal Penitentiary Service.\n\nHowever, in March 2013, Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee reversed the judgment, saying Magnitsky had not faced either \u201cphysical violence or torture,\u201d adding: \u201cA decision has been taken to end the criminal case because of the absence of a crime.\u201d\n\nSeveral months later, Russia found Magnitsky guilty of tax evasion in the country\u2019s first-ever posthumous trial. That case was organized by many of the officials that Magnitsky had exposed in the $230 million tax refund theft.\n\nAmnesty international called the posthumous trial of Magnitsky \u201cfarcical\u201d and \u201csinister.\u201d\n\nAs a result of Magnitsky\u2019s death, Browder successfully lobbied for the Magnitsky Act, the U.S. law that targets Russian officials implicated in human rights and corruption cases. In 2016, the U.S. Congress passed a global version of that bill, allowing foreign officials implicated in human rights abuses worldwide to be sanctioned.\n\nSimilar acts have been adopted by Britain, Canada and the Baltic states. This week, the Dutch Foreign Ministry was scheduled to submit a draft on an EU-wide Magnitsky bill, although it will not bear Magintsky\u2019s name, reportedly due to political pressure.\n\nRussia has sought Browder\u2019s arrest on a number of charges, most recently convicting him in absentia on an alleged $79 million tax fraud scheme. He was also convicted in absentia of tax fraud in 2013.\n\nBrowder told Rolling Stone magazine earlier this year that Russia\u2019s continued campaign against him, including his arrest in Spain this past May at Russia\u2019s request, showed the \u201cMagnitsky Act is working and we\u2019ve found the Achilles\u2019 heel of the Putin regime.\u201d\n\nAnd while the Kremlin has provided no evidence that could allow for a thorough scientific debunking of its Magnitsky poisoning conspiracy claim, available evidence clearly demonstrates that medical neglect, aggravated by torture and an \u201coutright disregard for the well\u2010being of Mr. Magnitsky.\u201d\n\nWe judge the Kremlin\u2019s claim that Magnitsky was potentially poisoned on Browder's orders to be false.", "lang": "en"}
