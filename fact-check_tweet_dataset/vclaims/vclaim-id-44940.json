Also, a video (archived) with the same message is being shared. There are multiple findings given in the post. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nOn Italy\u2019s \u2018Ministero della Salute\u2019 (Ministry of Health) website, it can be read that there is no specific treatment for the COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is mentioned that \u2018treatment remains mainly based on a symptomatic approach, providing supportive therapies (e.g. oxygen therapy, fluid management) to infected people, which can nevertheless be highly effective. Several clinical trials are underway for the treatment of COVID-19 disease\u2019. The same can be read on the WHO website.\n\nAlso, it is found that Italy\u2019s Ministry of Health has itself debunked the claim that the cure for COVID-19 was found in Italy.\n\nOn the \u2018Ministero della Salute\u2019 website, it can be seen that COVID-19 disease is caused by a virus named SARS-CoV-2. Also, they have debunked the claim that the disease is caused by a bacterium. So, they have not claimed anything against the existing view.\n\nDid WHO ask countries not to conduct autopsies of patients dead with COVID-19?\n\nNo such guidelines were released by WHO. Also, in the Interim guidance document released by WHO with the title \u2013 \u2018Infection Prevention and Control for the safe management of a dead body in the context of COVID-19\u2019, it can be seen that a list of safety measures was suggested to be followed while conducting an autopsy.\n\nIn the post, it is given that the cure is with the \u2018antibiotics, anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants\u2019 (Aspirin). But on the \u2018Ministero della Salute\u2019 website, it can be read that \u2018no drug has yet proven their effectiveness in treating COVID-19\u2019. There is no specific drug for COVID-19. Some of the drugs made available to COVID-19 patients can be seen on the Italian Medicines Agency \u2013 AIFA website. In a scientific brief released by WHO with the title \u2013 \u2018The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients with COVID-19\u2019 on 19 April 2020, it can be read that \u2018at present there is no evidence of severe adverse events, acute health care utilization, long-term survival, or quality of life in patients with COVID-19, as a result of the use of NSAIDs\u2019.\n\nAlso, the Press Information Bureau (India) has tweeted that the message claiming Aspirin as a cure for COVID-19 is fake.\n\nMultiple research studies and news reports can be found regarding thrombosis in COVID-19 patients. Contrary to the claim made in the post, it can be read in various news articles that patients were kept on ventilators in Italy.\n\nTo sum it up, Italy has neither found the cure for COVID-19 nor published the findings given in the post.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
