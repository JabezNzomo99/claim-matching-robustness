No, that's not true. The California Highway Patrol said the photo included in a meme making that claim is from an old accident prior to 2020, and the driver died of a medical emergency, not COVID-19.\n\nThe claim originated as a post (archived here) where it was published by Facebook on June 26, 2020. It said:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nCalifornia Highway Patrol Public Information Officer Shawn Gordon from Yreka, California, told Lead Stories this is an old photograph and the person who died had a medical emergency.\n\n\"This photograph is of an accident that happened in our area. But it is old. It did not happen this year and the details in the post are not true,\" he said on June 30, 2020.\n\nThe photograph from the scene on Interstate 5 in Yreka shows a big rig truck on the side of the road with two highway patrol cars and an ambulance.\n\nThe post claimed \"Driver tested positive for Corona virus 19,\" but Officer Gordon told Lead Stories that was also false.\n\n\"It is not true that the driver had COVID-19. There was a medical emergency.\"\n\nThe post claimed the contents of the truck were contaminated:\n\nOfficer Gordon told Lead Stories that was another false claim. \"The truck did not contain PPE (personal protective equipment) and it was not infected with COVID-19.\"\n\nIn addition to misspelling the name of the governor of California, Gavin Newsom, the post cited no source for any of its claims.", "lang": "en"}
