The viral post also contains a website link requesting people to register themselves to vote in the Lok Sabha polls.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be false.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nA Facebook user \"Sukant Sahu\" shared the post, which uses a screenshot of the official website of the Election Commission. The caption with the post reads, \"Hello all, those who hold Indian passport can now vote online for 2019 elections. Please register yourself on https://eci.gov.in. There is a link Enroll as NRI voter. Please spread the word in your different groups.\"\n\nThe URL in the post leads to the website of the Election Commission of India. The post was widely shared on Twitter as well. Twitter accounts of \"RakshTheLuck\" and \"Chowkidar Live for narendramodi\" also shared the post with the same claim.\n\nAFWA ran a Google search to check whether the claim is indeed true and found that the official EC spokesperson Sheyphali Sharan published a series of tweets on February 21, 2019, from her verified account, clarifying that reports of online voting being allowed for NRIs were false.\n\nThe EC even posted a warning on its official website, saying that NRIs would need to fill up Form 6A to register as voters and will have to physically appear at their designated polling stations to cast their votes.\n\n\n\nThere are also several news reports of EC clarifying that overseas Indians are not allowed to vote online. To bust the fake news that has been doing the rounds on WhatsApp since February, the EC had sent a written complaint to Delhi police. boomlive.com also debunked the post as a fake one.", "lang": "en"}
