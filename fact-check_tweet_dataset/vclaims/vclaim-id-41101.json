The claim was spotted through Facebook's fact check tool Claim Check.\n\nThe facts: The people in the video were intoxicated, not dead, according to a Taiwan-based news channel that refuted the claim that the people consumed fake alcohol.\n\nA reverse image search showed two different false claims that were attributed to the video. One said people supposedly died because of drinking fake wine in Dongguan, China. Another said they were poisoned after eating crayfish.\n\nA news report by Shanghai-based daily newspaper Liberation Daily, translated to English through Google Translate, said 5 people were in a small lobster shop in Guangzhou past midnight on September 14. Three of them became unconscious because of drinking excessive liquor and beer.\n\nAll 5 were admitted to the Baiyun District Chinese Medicine Hospital and were found to be intoxicated. Only those unconscious were treated. Blood test results showed there were no abnormalities among those who were treated.\n\nA separate report on SETN Sanli News Network, a Taiwan-based online news channel, said that the video was not taken in Dongguan and the people in the video were not drinking fake wine. They dismissed the claim as a \u201crumor.\u201d\n\nFacebook page Taxiuncle Group, which shared the claim, has around 12,000 followers. According to its \"About\" section, the page is a \u201ccommunity network for sharing info.\u201d While it is not specifically described as a Filipino community, a number of comments on the alleged fake beer story were in Filipino. \u2013 Glenda Marie Castro/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
