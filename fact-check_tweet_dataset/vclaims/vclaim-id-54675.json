The claim says this is how Vedas, Puranas and Upanishads are \u201cadulterated\u201d.\n\nExtract from one such post on Facebook in Hindi translates to, \u201cThe work of adulteration of our religious texts is in full swing. After 20 years, our next generation will read these adulterated Vedas, Puranas and Upanishads.\u201d\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be false. The image, from an Islamic seminary in Hyderabad, shows students studying Hindu religious scripts to understand the common attributes in both religions.\n\nMany have replied to the post, asking the Centre to take immediate action and termed the act \u201cbook jihad\u201d. The archived versions of some of the posts can be seen here, here and here.\n\nThe post has further compared the image to the work of British historian TB Macaulay and western academician Max Muller on Hindu religious texts. However, since it is a matter of academic interpretation and opinion, we are not looking into that.\n\nUsing reverse image search, we found a report by \u201cThe Hindu\u201d which has used the same picture. According to this report from April 2014, the image shows students at the library of an Islamic seminary in Hyderabad studying the Vedas to understand the common attributes in Islam and Hinduism.\n\nThe article further says that the library belongs to Al Mahadul Aali Al Islami seminary and it has more than 1,000 books on other religions. The caption of the image, clicked by \u201cThe Hindu\u201d photojournalist G Ramakrishna reads, \u201cStudents at Al Mahadul Aali Al Islami studying the Vedas to understand the common attributes in Islam and Hinduism. This seminary has more than 1000 books on other religions at Hyderabad.\u201d\n\nWhen AFWA contacted the institute, its deputy director Oman Abedeen confirmed that the image was clicked at their library.\n\n\u201cAl Mahadul Aali Al Islami is an Islamic research institute. We have a department called \u2018Studies of Indian Scripture\u2019 that offers students an understanding of Hinduism. We teach them Hindu Vedas such as Bhagavad Gita and Upanishads. We also invite scholars from other faiths to take classes for our students so that they get the best understanding of every religion,\u201d Abedeen said.\n\n\u201cOnce a team from \u2018The Hindu\u2019 visited our institute and they were surprised to see our collection of books. That\u2019s when the said image was clicked. At present, we have around 1,500 books from other religions, including Hinduism and Christianity,\u201d Abedeen added.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the viral image shows Muslim youths rewriting Hindu religious scriptures is false. The image from Al Mahadul Aali Al Islami seminary in Hyderabad shows students studying the Vedas to understand the similarities between Islam and Hinduism.", "lang": "en"}
