Questions concerned attitudes about upward mobility through hard work, rates of citizenship, opinions about Muslim immigrants\u2019 attempts to adopt American culture and whether respondents identified primarily as American or Muslim. The survey also considered indicators such as the number of non-Muslims one had in his or her close circle of friends, as well as more overt signs such as displaying the American flag.\n\nThe responses to those surveys led to an overall conclusion by Pew that Muslim Americans are \u201chighly assimilated into American society.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a Gallup poll that came out the same year found that 69 percent of Muslim Americans identify \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d strongly with the U.S. (somewhat less than U.S. Protestants and Catholics), and that Muslim Americans were nearly as likely to strongly identify with their faith. Gallup concluded that, as with every group, including Muslim Americans, \u201cpeople who identify extremely strongly with the U.S. are also more likely to identify strongly with their worldwide religious identity.\u201d Moreover, Gallup observed a \u201cnoticeable\u201d trend in \u201cthe degree to which thriving Muslim Americans demonstrate a sense of ownership and belonging to their country.\u201d\n\nWe also spoke to several experts on Muslim Americans, all of whom told us Trump\u2019s claim was off base and uninformed. We reached out to the Trump campaign for clarification and backup, but as usual we did not hear back.\n\nWhile these surveys and expert observations contradict Trump\u2019s pronouncement that Muslim immigrants\u2019 assimilation to America is \u201cpretty close\u201d to \u201cnonexistent,\u201d Trump appears to have tapped into a popular misconception. While a majority of Muslim Americans in the Pew Research Center survey said that most Muslims who come to the U.S. want to adopt American customs and ways of life, just a third of Americans at large believe that. And in a Pew survey earlier this year, 25 percent of Americans said they believe at least half of all U.S. Muslims are anti-American, even as about half of Americans said they did not know any Muslims.\n\nPew estimated there were about 3.3 million Muslims living in the U.S. in 2015, meaning Muslims made up about 1 percent of the overall population. Pew estimates that share will double by 2050.\n\nAfter analyzing the responses by Muslim Americans to a lengthy and varied set of questions, the Pew Research Center concluded that \u2014 contrary to Trump\u2019s assertion \u2014 Muslim Americans are \u201chighly assimilated.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s dig into the highlights of some of Pew\u2019s specific findings:\n\u2022 Muslims are more likely than other immigrants to become U.S. citizens. Four out of five Muslim Americans are U.S. citizens, including 70 percent of those born outside the U.S. That is a much higher rate than the broader immigrant population in the U.S., as 47 percent of all foreign-born are citizens.\n\u2022 Nearly three-quarters of Muslim Americans (74 percent) believe that \u201c[m]ost people can get ahead if they are willing to work hard.\u201d That rate of optimism is higher than the general public, 62 percent.\n\u2022 A roughly similar percentage of Muslims and Christians in the U.S. say they think of themselves first as either Muslim (49 percent) or Christian (46 percent). Among white evangelicals, 70 percent said they identify first as Christian. A higher percentage of Christians as a whole say they identify as Americans first, 46 percent, compared with 26 percent among Muslim Americans. But Muslim Americans were more likely (18 percent versus 6 percent) to say they considered themselves Muslim and American equally.\n\u2022 A majority of Muslim Americans (56 percent) responded that most Muslims who come to the U.S. want to adopt American customs and ways of life, while 20 percent said those Muslim immigrants want to be distinct from the larger American society (16 percent said they wanted to do both).\n\u2022 About half of Muslim Americans say that only some or hardly any of their close friends are Muslims, while half say most or all of their close friends are Muslims.\n\u2022 More than six in 10 Muslim Americans see no conflict between being a devout Muslim and living in a modern society, almost identical to the rates among U.S. Christians.\n\u2022 Half of Muslim immigrants say they display the American flag at home, at the office or on the car, and 33 percent of native-born Muslims reported doing so as well. Overall, displaying the American flag is less common among Muslim Americans (44 percent) than among the population as a whole (59 percent).\n\nAssimilation is a complex issue, said Besheer Mohamed, a senior researcher at the Pew Research Center, but on the whole, the Pew surveys show a \u201cpretty significant embrace of American culture.\u201d The high rates of citizenship, for one, suggest Muslims are \u201ccoming to the United States and committing to making a life here,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are some differences between the general American population and Muslims on some issues. For example, Mohamed said, views on homosexuality are more conservative among Muslim Americans than the general population, but more accepting than, say, evangelical Christians, Mormons or Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.\n\nClearly, he said, there is a disconnect between the attitudes of Muslims about integration versus the perceptions of non-Muslim Americans about Muslim assimilation.\n\nA Pew survey released in February found that 25 percent of Americans believe at least half of all U.S. Muslims are anti-American. That does not jibe with attitudes expressed in the Pew surveys. Indeed, Pew found that Muslim Americans are generally happy with their lives and the direction of the country, and more than three-quarters rate their community as an excellent or good place to live \u2014 roughly the same level of satisfaction among the U.S. population overall.\n\nExperts on Islam we spoke to said they were not surprised at the disconnect between tangible signs of high-levels of Muslim assimilation and the opposite perception among many non-Muslim Americans. They say Trump\u2019s comment feeds that disconnect.\n\nIn addition to what the surveys above said, they all said their personal and professional experience does not jibe with Trump\u2019s claim.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another bizarre claim, one that I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve actually heard before from a mainstream American politician,\u201d said Shadi Hamid, senior fellow for the Project on U.S. Relations with the Islamic World in the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt\u2019s actually quite the opposite: The U.S. is a relative success story when it comes to Muslim integration.\u201d\n\nAkbar Ahmed, chair of Islamic studies at American University and former Pakistan high commissioner to the U.K. and Ireland, said that Trump\u2019s claim about low assimilation rates for Muslim Americans is not only inaccurate, but also \u201cfeeds into a stereotype already existing in the U.S.,\u201d namely that a Muslim identity is incompatible with an American identity and values.\n\nAhmed, described by the BBC as \u201cprobably the world\u2019s best known scholar on contemporary Islam,\u201d conducted a comprehensive study of Muslims in the U.S., and published his findings in the 2010 book \u201cJourney into America: The Challenge of Islam.\u201d In the book, Ahmed wrote (page 13) about encounters with conservative Muslims in the U.S. who were \u201caggressive in rejecting or ignoring \u2018corrosive and corrupting\u2019 American culture.\u201d But in a phone interview, Ahmed told us he heard many more comments like, \u201cthe U.S. is the best place in the world to be a Muslim\u201d and \u201cI\u2019d rather live here than anywhere else in the world.\u201d\n\nIn his travels around the U.S. with his academic team, Ahmed said he met many Muslim Americans who encountered incidents of prejudice after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. But he said, they made a determination to stay in the U.S. Their decision to hang on to their American identity in the face of that stress speaks to their commitment to it, he said.\n\nAhmed points to other signs of assimilation: Muslims serving in the military, about 5,896 as of 2015, according to ABC News; the fact that there are now two Muslims serving in Congress; and a growing number of Muslim journalists, including CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria.\n\nShahed Amanullah, a former senior adviser to the U.S. State Department for outreach with Muslim communities around the world, sees a near doubling of the number of mosques in the U.S. since Sept. 11, 2001, as evidence that Muslim immigrants have committed to an identity as American Muslims.\n\n\u201cIf you are building houses of worship, you want to become part of that community,\u201d Amanullah told us in a phone interview. \u201cIt is a sign that Muslims in America decided to double down on their identity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my circle, I don\u2019t see it,\u201d Amanullah said of Trump\u2019s claim about an unwillingness or inability on the part of Muslims in America to assimilate. \u201cTheir children are upwardly mobile. They don\u2019t care for isolation and they look to embrace all that America has to offer.\u201d\n\nAmanullah and Ahmed both noted that the Muslim American experience is markedly different from the immigrant Muslim experience in Europe, an issue that was explored by the International Business Times last year. European relations with Muslim immigrants are colored by issues of colonialism, Ahmed said, which has made integration more difficult than in the U.S. The U.S., on the other hand, has a tradition of immigration that is more conducive to integration of Muslim Americans, the IBT article said.\n\nHamid, of Brookings, challenged the very notion that assimilation is a worthy pursuit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also unclear why \u2018assimilation\u2019 should even be the goal,\u201d said Hamid, author of \u201cIslamic Exceptionalism: How the Struggle Over Islam is Reshaping the World.\u201c \u201cThat is not the American model. Religious and ethnic groups in the U.S. have not generally been expected to assimilate in the sense of giving up their heritage or traditions.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s different from countries like France, Hamid said, where \u201can aggressive French secularism asks conservative Muslims to make a choice between their conservative religious practice and their Frenchness. To impose such a choice alienates Muslims and pushes them outside the fold, and it\u2019s something the U.S. would do well to avoid.\u201d\n\nAgain, we allow that assimilation can mean different things to different people. And while it is true that some Muslim immigrants may choose not to integrate into American society, Trump makes a blanket statement that assimilation among Muslim immigrants is \u201cpretty close\u201d to \u201cnonexistent.\u201d There is plenty of evidence to the contrary.", "lang": "en"}
