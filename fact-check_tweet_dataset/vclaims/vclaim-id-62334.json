Zero cases sana tayo.\" (If we started the lockdown in the Philippines as early as October 2019, we would have had zero cases.)\n\nA reader emailed to Rappler for verification a screenshot of a Facebook user's post that shared the quote card. Upon checking, the Facebook user's post appears to have been deleted.\n\nHowever, the quote card is still being shared by some users and pages, according to Facebook's Claim Check dashboard. One such post, first posted on June 27, has been shared at least 143 times and has received around 400 reactions and nearly 100 comments as of writing.\n\nThe facts: Robredo did not say the quote attributed to her in the claim.\n\nThere are no reports from credible news organizations or statements from the Office of the Vice President that contain this quote from Robredo.\n\nThe graphic with the claim also cropped and edited an actual Rappler quote card featuring Robredo. That graphic contained an actual quote from Robredo on June 25 where she criticized the government's seeming \"lack of urgency\" in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
