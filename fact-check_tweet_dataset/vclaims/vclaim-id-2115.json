Currently, that cut off point is \u00a323,250.\n\nSecond, the value of people\u2019s houses will always be counted towards that figure. At the moment it is not counted for people who receive care in their own homes.\n\nLast, the manifesto says that everybody will be able to pay for social care by having their home sold after they die. Previously, this only applied to people in care homes or nursing homes: it will now extend to people getting care in their own homes as well.\n\nUnder the current system, councils can also refuse to offer this provision to people who have more than \u00a323,250 in capital and savings and people whose dependent relatives or spouse rely on the same house. The manifesto does not say whether this will remain the case.\n\nAs Priti Patel\u2019s claim implies, nobody will have to sell their homes within their lifetime under the proposed system, although we don\u2019t yet know whether some people will still be ineligible for deferred payment. However, this isn\u2019t due to the \u00a3100,000 asset threshold: it\u2019s a separate provision.\n\nVince Cable is also right that as long as their assets do not deplete to below \u00a3100,000, under these proposals there would be no limit to how much people may have to pay for social care. The Coalition government had discussed introducing cap on spending of \u00a372,000, but this was delayed until at least 2020.", "lang": "en"}
