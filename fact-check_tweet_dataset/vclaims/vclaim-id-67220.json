But Block\u2019s claim that Rhode Island has the most expensive unemployment system in the country -- a claim he has made repeatedly, including in -- is a checkable statement.\n\nWe emailed his campaign and asked for its evidence.\n\nBlock\u2019s policy director, Matthew Schweich, sent us a link to the \" ,\" published by The Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group. It ranks Rhode Island as 46 out of the 50 states, based on a complicated scale that assesses how well a state's tax system enhances or harms the competitiveness of the state\u2019s business environment.\n\nIn a category that compares unemployment insurance systems, Rhode Island ranks the worst.\n\nBut Block didn't say the state has the worst system. He said it has the most expensive. The report doesn't have a state-by-state comparison of expense.\n\nIn fact, Rhode Island was not ranked worst in any of the measures quantified in the report. The state has the sixth-highest minimum tax rate charged to employers and the 10th-highest maximum tax rate. Its taxable wage base -- the income level beyond which employers don't have to pay additional tax -- is higher in 14 other states, according to The Tax Foundation report.\n\nWhen we raised this issue with Block's office, Schweich argued in an email that, \"You can\u2019t measure the overall cost of a program by evaluating just a single metric. So, even if Rhode Island isn\u2019t ranked absolute bottom in any individual category, the cumulative effect of being ranked near the bottom across many categories can demonstrate that, overall, RI\u2019s system is the most expensive.\"\n\nHe also argued that there are many ways to define \"expensive.\"\n\n\"Does it mean the cost to the state? The cost to employers? The economic and reputational cost to Rhode Island of being ranked bottom?\" he wrote. \"The Tax Foundation has produced the most detailed ranking of [unemployment insurance] programs, so we used it as a basis for this statement. We were satisfied with the methodology.\"\n\nThen we called The Tax Foundation and spoke to Joseph Henchman, coauthor of the study. He said a ranking of 50 out of 50 didn't necessarily make Rhode Island's program the most expensive. Other factors are considered as well.\n\n\"We're measuring both expense and compliance and administrative costs,\" he said, explaining that the foundation would prefer to characterize Rhode Island's system as the most burdensome or the most complex.\n\nFor example, one reason Rhode Island scored low in the rankings was because a local business has to be in operation three years before its actual track record for hiring and firing employees is used to set its unemployment insurance tax rate. Until then, the business is simply assigned a rate, which can be unfair to a company with a steady employee base. In most states, a business' experience rating is set after one year.\n\nInstead, Henchman sent us a 2011 report he authored . In a comparison of the average unemployment tax rates, Rhode Island ranked third highest behind Idaho and Oregon for 2010, and in a comparison of the average weekly unemployment insurance benefits, the state ranked fourth highest, behind Hawaii, New Jersey and Massachusetts.\n\nAnd that was before Rhode Island implemented a series of changes, still being phased in, that will decrease the average weekly benefit over time, according to Henchman's study.\n\nFinally, we looked at a recent report from the U.S. Department of Labor . The state-by-state ranking of tax rates that employers paid on total wages in the second quarter of 2012 shows Rhode Island ranked as the fifth highest, behind Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho and Oregon, all of which taxed more.\n\nIn the ranking of the average weekly benefit paid to the unemployed in the second quarter of 2013, Rhode Island came in 10th behind Colorado, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wyoming, all of which paid more.\n\nKen Block said Rhode Island's unemployment insurance system \"is the most expensive such system in the country.\"\n\nIf he had said we were AMONG the most expensive, he would be on solid ground. But he has repeatedly insisted that Rhode Island's program is THE most expensive.\n\nThe only evidence he supplied was a Tax Foundation report that doesn't directly evaluate the expense of the system. And other measures, from the foundation itself and U.S. Department of Labor, say it's not the most expensive.\n\nBecause Block was unequivocal, we will be as well.
