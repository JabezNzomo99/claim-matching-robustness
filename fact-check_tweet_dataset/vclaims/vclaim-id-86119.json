At that pace, he will top 5,000 claims in September.\n\nOn July 5, the president had reached a new daily high of 79 false and misleading claims, but he came close on Aug. 30 with 73 claims, when he held a campaign rally and had an extended interview with Bloomberg News. On a monthly basis, June and August rank in first and second place during Trump's presidency, with 534 and 469 claims, respectively. July is in third place, with 448 claims.\n\nTrump has a proclivity to repeat, over and over, many of his false or misleading statements. We\u2019ve counted nearly 160 claims that the president has repeated at least three times, some with breathtaking frequency.\n\nAlmost one third of Trump\u2019s claims \u2014 1,458 \u2014 relate to economic issues, trade deals or jobs. He frequently takes credit for jobs created before he became president or company decisions with which he had no role. He cites his \u201cincredible success\u201d in terms of job growth, even though annual job growth under his presidency has been slower than the last five years of Barack Obama\u2019s term. Almost 40 times, he has claimed the economy today is the \u201cgreatest\u201d in U.S. history, an absurd statement not backed up by data.\n\nJust on trade, the president has made 496 false or misleading claims. He frequently gets the size of trade deficits wrong or presents the numbers in a misleading fashion. Five times in one week, he touted the false claim that the trade deficit fell by $52 billion from the first to the second quarter, calling it one of the \u201cbiggest wins\u201d in the latest GDP report. In a somewhat unusual move, he stopped making this claim after we published a fact check showing his math was faulty.\n\nMore often than not, the president can\u2019t let go of a favorite talking point. On June 20, he claimed he had received a phone call from the head of U.S. Steel and learned the company had announced it would open \u201csix major facilities.\u201d But U.S. Steel had made no such announcement and we debunked this claim as worthy of Four Pinocchios. Yet 23 more times over 10 weeks, the president has asserted that U.S. Steel was building new plants, inflating it even to seven facilities and then to eight.\n\nNot surprisingly, immigration is the top source of Trump\u2019s misleading claims, now totaling 592. Forty-three times just in the past six months, for instance, the president has falsely claimed his long-promised border wall with Mexico is being built, even though Congress has denied funding for it.\n\nBut moving up the list quickly are claims about the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether people in the Trump campaign were in any way connected to it. The president has made 445 statements about the Russia probe, using hyperbolic claims of \u201cworse than Watergate,\u201d \u201cMcCarthyism\u201d and, of course, \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d He often asserts the Democrats colluded with the Russians, even though the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign were victims of Russian activities, as emails were hacked and then released via WikiLeaks. All told, more than 200 times the president has made claims suggesting the Russia probe is made up, a hoax or a fraud.\n\nOn foreign policy, the president consistently misstates NATO spending. Nearly 70 times, he has falsely said the United States pays as much as 90 percent of the alliance\u2019s costs and that other NATO members \u201cowe\u201d money. But he is conflating overall defense spending with NATO obligations \u2014 and the United States, unlike many NATO allies, has global responsibilities. Nearly 50 times, Trump has made misleading claims about negotiations with North Korea, either suggesting previous administrations had not tried to restrain North Korea's nuclear ambitions or that he had solved the problem with ease.", "lang": "en"}
