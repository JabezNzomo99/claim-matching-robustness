The data\u2019s not good enough to know\n\nThe 30,000 estimate has significant limitations, and cannot be fairly used to draw a link to a supposed rising crime epidemic.\n\nThe figure of 30,000 children comes from the Office of the Children\u2019s Commissioner. It produced this estimate in a 2017 study, using data from 2013/14 from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which reported that 0.9% of 10-15 year olds it surveyed in England and Wales described themselves as being in a street gang.\n\nBut this figure is subject to significant uncertainty, as The Office of the Children\u2019s Commissioner noted at the time. The survey didn\u2019t include children who are detained, \u201cmissing\u201d, or living in health and care residential establishments, and the definition of a street gang is quite broad.\n\nThe figure of 30,000 could vary a lot if there\u2019s just a small amount of error in the survey\u2019s findings. The 0.9% figure equates to about 26 young people (in a survey of 3,000) reporting themselves as being in a gang. In a repeat survey for 2016/17, it found 0.7% did so, but that\u2019s the equivalent of about five fewer young people.\n\nUltimately, the sample size, infrequency and wider data recording issues mean we can\u2019t confidently say exactly how many children are in gangs, and whether this number has gone up or down in recent years. While this is the best available data we have on gangs, it cannot be taken as evidence that young people are fuelling a \u201cviolent crime epidemic\u201d.\n\nThis article does not assess whether or not there is such an \u201cepidemic\u201d.\n\nThe 30,000 estimate comes from 2014\n\n0.9% of 10-15 year olds in England in Wales reported that they were a member of a street gang, according to ONS data for 2013/14, sourced to the Crime Survey for England and Wales. This is the data which the Times report says the office of the Children\u2019s Commissioner used.\n\nIn 2017, the Office of the Children\u2019s Commissioner used the 0.9% figure to estimate that around 30,000 10-15 year olds were in street gangs in England, based on population figures for England (mid-2015). It also assumes that gang-membership levels are the same in both England and Wales.\n\nThe ONS published more recent data in May this year (which wouldn\u2019t have been available to the Children\u2019s Commissioner when their report was published). It finds that 0.7% of 10-15 year olds in England and Wales reported being in a gang in 2016/17. It also reports that 0.2% of 16 to 24 year olds are a member of a street gang, compared to 0.7% in the 2013/14 data.\n\nThe data can\u2019t give us a very precise number\n\nThe sample sizes of the research mean it\u2019s hard to precisely estimate the number of children in gangs, or change over time. Applying the reported percentage of 10-15 year olds in gangs to population statistics suggests that the number in England has fallen by 7,000 from 2013/14 to 2016/17. Yet this is the equivalent to about five fewer people (in a survey of around 3,000) reporting that they are in a gang in the 2016/17 survey. Given what we also know about young children responding inaccurately, or giving \u201cfunny\u201d answers, in surveys, this data isn\u2019t good enough to give a very precise sense of change over time.\n\nStreet gangs are also not necessarily committing criminal activities, according to the ONS definition. It told us its survey defined a street gang as:\n\n\u201cgroups of young people who hang around together and\n\u2022 Have a name, a colour or something else to identify the group;\n\u2022 possibly have rules or a leader; or\n\nThere are more reasons these numbers should be treated with caution\n\nThe 30,000 figure formed part of a report on vulnerable children, in which the Children\u2019s Commissioner recognised that the data available to it on street gangs was limited and \u201cshould be treated with caution\u201d. It added: \u201cThe information for people involved in gangs or have been victims of gangs is very limited and our research revealed an important gap in the data.\u201d\n\nIt also highlighted that the ONS data doesn\u2019t cover \u201cpeople living in health and care residential establishments as well as people detained are not included in these estimates. Children included in the missing population may face an increased risk to be involved in gangs and thus the estimates may underreport the real numbers.\u201d\n\nThe Office of the Children\u2019s Commissioner told us that: \u201cWe don\u2019t collect data but collate it from many sources and sometimes the starting point for an estimate may be, in our own view, statistically dated, or weak but nonetheless, within certain standards, the best available at the time. Where that is the case we do what we think we can, transparently, to model towards a reasonable estimate of what the number is at the time of publishing.\u201d\n\nThis data cannot be treated as evidence for a supposed violent crime epidemic\n\nThe lack of consistently published data and limitations in recording practices mean it\u2019s hard to get a perfect picture around the number of young people in gangs. It certainly seems a stretch to use the existing data as evidence of a phenomenon which is fuelling a supposed \u201cviolent crime epidemic\u201d, given the limitations we highlight above.\n\nThe Office of the Children\u2019s Commissioner told us that: \u201cEver since the Office of the Children\u2019s Commissioner undertook to assess the levels of vulnerable children in England in 2016, with a view to publishing findings in 2017, there has been a dual purpose.\n\n\u201cFirstly to fill an existing statistical gap and find the best possible and reliable estimates we could for numbers that previously have not been calculated, and to beg the question \u201cwhy hadn\u2019t they been?\u201d \u2026\n\n\u201cSecondly to highlight how hard it can be to arrive at those numbers when data collection can be patchy, sometimes non-existent, subject to local variation, variations of interpretation of official terms (not least the word \u2018vulnerable\u2019) and in what form the data came.\u201d\n\nThey also said that: \u201cIn looking to next year part of our call on Government and local authorities and other services will be to provide our calculations on Vulnerable Children with data that is fresher, more robust and comprehensive on the area of gang membership.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
