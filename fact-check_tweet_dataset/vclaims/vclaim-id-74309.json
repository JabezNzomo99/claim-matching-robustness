Data may reflect difference in reporting methods, retrospective data consolidation and reporting delays\u201d reads a caveat on the health organisation daily infographic updates.\n\nTo check Prof Okolo\u2019s figures, The ICIR instead of using July 16 analysed data released on July 17 by WHO. This is because WHO clearly states that the data for July 17 were confirmed cases as at July 16.\n\nThese data showed that the five West African countries with the highest number of coronavirus cases account for 89,222 out of the total 102, 661 total coronavirus cases recorded in the region.\n\nThese five countries are Nigeria, Ghana, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Senegal and Guinea, the same Prof. Okolo made reference too.\n\nThe figures are Nigeria 34,854, Ghana 26,125, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire 13,403, Senegal 8,481, and Guinea 6,359, totalling 89,222.\n\nAnd the total for ECOWAS member states as at July 16 is 102,661\u2013 Benin 1,463, Burkina Faso 1,038, Cabo Verde 1,894, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire 13,403, Gambia 78, Ghana 26,125, Guinea 6,359, Guinea-Bissau 1,927, Liberia 1,070, Mali 2,440, Niger 1,102, Nigeria 34,854, Senegal 8,481, Sierra Leone 1,678, and Togo 749.\n\nTo ascertain the claim that Nigeria and four other countries are responsible for over 80 per cent of COVID-19 cases in West Africa, the total of the five countries, 89,222 and the total of the West African countries, 102,661 were calculated and the result is approximately 87 per cent.\n\nFrom WHO data the five countries recorded 89,222 cases against the 84,118 stated by Prof Okolo and the total of confirmed cases in the region is 102,661 against the 96,936 figure he gave. This is a difference of 5,104 and 5,725 respectively.\n\nIn addition the WAHO for their daily update gave the total number of COVID-19 cases in the region to be 102,787 This figure is still more than Prof Okolo\u2019s figure with more than 5,851.\n\nThe claim that Nigeria and four other countries are responsible for over 80 per cent of COVID-19 cases in West Africa is TRUE.\n\nThe claim that as at July 16, the five countries recorded 84,118 cases out of the 96,936 cases in the region is FALSE.", "lang": "en"}
