Joe Pitts, R-Pa., lamented the toll of addiction in his state and across the country.\n\n\"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day,\" Pitts wrote. \"Overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms.\"\n\nWe wondered whether those numbers were accurate, so we took a closer look.\n\nThe CDC calculates overdose deaths from prescription drugs separately from overdose deaths from illicit drugs. To get the full number, you have to add both categories together.\n\nIn 2014, there were 25,760 deaths from prescription-drug overdoses.\n\nThat same year, there were 17,465 deaths from illicit drugs, including heroin and cocaine.\n\nThe agency does not track overdoses from every illicit drug, so this accounting may understate the full number. Still, it provides a baseline. And if you add together the overdose deaths from prescription and illicit drugs, the sum is 43,225 overdose deaths.\n\nThen, if you divide that by 365 days, it works out to more than 118 overdose deaths a day, or just shy of the 120-per-day figure that Pitts cited. That\u2019s close enough for us.\n\nWe should note that the category of total overdoses includes accidental deaths, homicides, suicides and deaths of undetermined intent.\n\nSo how do the number of deaths from drug overdoses compare with the number of deaths from firearms?\n\nAccording to CDC, there were 33,599 deaths caused by firearms in 2014. That includes homicides, suicides, legal interventions, accidents and cases of undetermined intentions.\n\nSo in 2014, there were indeed more overdose deaths (43,225) than there were deaths from firearms (33,599), making Pitts\u2019 second claim correct.\n\nPitts said that \"according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day. Overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms.\" Pitts is very close on the first part, and he\u2019s correct on the second. So we rate his statement True.", "lang": "en"}
