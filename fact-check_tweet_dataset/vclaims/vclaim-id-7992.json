Missler won the $451 million jackpot on january 5th 2018 but opted for a lump sum payment of $281.2 million instead of payment in installments.\n\nUnfortunately the tweet (archived here) is bogus:\n\nThe twitter account @Shane_Missler was only registered on January 15th 2018 while Shane's real account @TheShaneMissler was registered in February 2016. He already used it to put out a warning about fake accounts:\n\nThat didn't seem to stop many people from taking a chance anyway: at the moment of writing the fake tweet was approaching 10,000 retweets. Weirdly the number of likes was only at 7,700 so at least 2,300 people were apparently not even smart enough to follow the full instructions of a hoax tweet.", "lang": "en"}
