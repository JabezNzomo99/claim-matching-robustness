But he runs into trouble by suggesting these would all be construction jobs.\n\nThe Keystone XL pipeline is a construction project, and so the most direct jobs are related to construction. These are basically short-term jobs, lasting on average 19.5 weeks, to assemble the pipeline that would help carry heavy crude oil from Canada\u2019s Alberta province to the Gulf Coast. Over two construction seasons, the main beneficiaries of the project would be Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska \u2014 each would need to hire between 2,700 and 4,000 construction workers \u2014 though Kansas would also hire about 200.\n\nBecause of the difficulty in determining whether the project would last one or two years, the State Department decided to express all of the jobs as an annual figure. So those 4,000 construction workers in Montana who work for 19 weeks were turned into nearly 1,500 jobs on annual basis.\n\nAll told, 10,400 construction workers, engaged for four- or eight-month periods, are expressed in the State Department report as 3,900 jobs \u2014 one position that is filled one full year \u2014 even though none of the jobs actually last a full year.\n\nThe figure that really should be used is 3,900 jobs. But it is also correct to say that 10,400 construction workers would get jobs, as long as a politician made clear this was mostly part-year employment.\n\nThe State Department also calculated that about 12,000 other annual jobs would stem from direct spending on the project. But some of these jobs have already been created. Workers in Arkansas, for instance, have already built about half of the high-strength line pipe needed for the project, some 333,000 tons.\n\nThe rest of the pipeline was built in Canada, Italy and India, but Trump said he said signed an order stating \u201cthe pipe should be made in the United States.\u201d So, if he follows through on that demand, the rest of the pipe, already built in other countries, would need to be built in the United States. So, for the sake of simplicity, let\u2019s credit all of 12,000 jobs to the revived project.\n\nThat still leaves Trump 12,000 jobs short. The State Department calculates another 26,000 jobs through \u201cindirect and induced spending.\u201d Some of that could be goods and services purchased by contractors, but it also means spending by employees working for a supplier of goods and services.\n\nAn appendix to the State Department report, for instance, says that 634 people would be employed in the \u201carts, entertainment and recreation services\u201d in the United States as a result of Keystone XL \u2014 and only 138 of those jobs would be in the construction states.\n\nNo single dancer in New York City is going to get a job because of Keystone XL, but just as the part-time work of the construction workers adds up to jobs expressed in annual terms, the economic model assumes some of that spending reverberates through the economy and eventually lands in the pockets of people across the country, thus contributing to a portion of their annual wage.\n\nBut in terms of construction jobs, even ones created through indirect spending, the total that emerges is 6,801 jobs. The number of manufacturing jobs (such as the pipe workers) that would be created amounts to 4,552.\n\nTrump said that Keystone would create 28,000 jobs, \u201cgreat construction jobs.\u201d In reality, the pipeline would create 3,900 construction jobs, though the figure could be pushed to nearly 7,000 construction jobs if you include indirect effects. The total number of direct jobs created, including construction, amounts to 16,000, according to the State Department.\n\nIt\u2019s important to get these numbers right and not over-promise the results of presidential action. We wavered between two and Three Pinocchios but Trump\u2019s suggestion these were all construction jobs tipped us to Three Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
