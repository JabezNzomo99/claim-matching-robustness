It has been claimed that the incident took place in Karnataka and it has been alleged that this is the state of affairs ever since the Congress-JDS government came to power in the state. The text accompanying the video says that this school is in Shivamogga in Karnataka. The video has been circulating on social media for the past one week or more.\n\nThe above clip shows that social media users are actively sharing this video and the accompanying claim. The claim has already been debunked by Boom Live and Shivamogga Live, a regional news outfit of Karnataka but this seems to have had little effect on purveyors of misinformation. On Twitter, many users have posted the video. Some even tagged Union HRD minister Prakash Javadekar exhorting him to take action.\n\nThe same video has been circulated on Facebook as well by a number of individual users and by pages and groups supportive of the BJP and RSS. One such page Yogi Adityanath- True Indian posted this video but later deleted it. It was also posted by the page Acche Din 2019.\n\nNot only Quran, Gita and Bible also taught\n\nBoom Live had reported that the incident occurred in Vidhyadeep Vidhyalaya, a kindergarten school in Shivamogga. It turns out that the video being shared widely is merely one of a two-part video. The second video shows another teacher teaching the students shlokas or verses from the Bhagwad Gita. The exercise was conducted as rehearsal for a programme to be held in the school on independence day and included recitation of verses from the Gita, Quran and the Bible. Shivamogga Live has posted a video on its Facebook page which shows the sequence of events.\n\nThe principal of the school has been quoted as saying, \u201cFor Environment Day we conducted a program where all the kindergarten students recited verses from all the three religious books. Since this was a success we thought of doing it again for Independence Day and the video shows us practicing for the same\u201d.\n\nIt is disturbing to note that an exercise conducted with the objective of fostering greater inter-faith harmony and understanding among young children has been given a devious spin to portray the exact opposite, and unfortunately seems to be working as despite being debunked by Shivamogga Live on June 30 and later on July 3 by Boom Live, this mischief continues to circulate.", "lang": "en"}
