Unfortunately, you can\u2019t factcheck the future.\n\nBut you can look at the story you\u2019re being told and decide if you think it\u2019s reasonable.\n\nThe report assesses what things have driven changes in incomes and wages over recent years and looks at forecasts for where those things are headed up to 2020/21. It then makes a judgement about the implications for incomes and income inequality.\n\nIts headline prediction is that income inequality might be set to rise by more than it has in any parliament since Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister.\n\nThat\u2019s based on a number of forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility. Those include slower growth in employment, earnings struggling to keep up with higher price inflation, tax cuts felt most by richer households and benefit cuts felt most by poorer households. It also suggests that auto-enrolment pension schemes will reduce the take-home pay of working-age households in the short term.\n\nAs the report itself adds, these are only projections.\n\nIt\u2019s better to describe the claim as a bottom-line judgement about where the economy and public policy are likely to go, rather than a fact, and at a time when there\u2019s plenty of uncertainty and debate about future of the economy the impact of leaving the EU, as the report acknowledges.\n\nThat\u2019s a fair summary of the general trend in inequality among disposable incomes over the past decade, although there\u2019s lots of ways to look at inequality.\n\nAfter increasing sharply in the 1980s, headline measures of disposable income inequality have fallen across most UK households in the last couple of decades (after taxes and benefits, and not accounting for housing costs).\n\nThat said, it matters at what point you measure household income and exactly which measure you use. It\u2019s stayed roughly the same on some measures if you count incomes before tax and benefits or after housing costs.\n\nAnd the overall movement has been the result of many of underlying trends. For example, a recent report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies concluded that although male earnings inequality had increased significantly in the last two decades, there had been a large fall in the proportion of people living in workless households, the earnings of men and women had become more equal, and pensioner incomes had grown faster than some parts of the working population. These are all meaningful changes in inequality in their own right.\n\nThe trend in inequality at the very top has been different to the trend across the bulk of the population. Although income inequality has generally fallen, the share of income that goes to the very richest households has continued to rise, and that\u2019s been reflected in the public interest about the incomes of the top 1%.\n\nSince the statistics vary from year to year, and the general downward trend is gradual, it\u2019s hard to give a definitive judgement how any of these trends have changed under the coalition and the most recent Conservative government.", "lang": "en"}
