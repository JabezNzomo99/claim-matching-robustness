Cory Booker claimed the Iran nuclear deal \u201cpushed back a nuclear breakout 10, 20 years.\u201d The deal pushed back the breakout time from two or three months to one year for at least 10 years.\n\u2022 Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio said the bottom 60 percent of workers \u201chaven\u2019t seen a raise since 1980.\u201d But two analyses of wage growth for the bottom 50 percent show some increase in wages since then.\n\u2022 Booker claimed private insurance overhead was 15 percent, while Medicare\u2019s was \u201conly at 2 percent.\u201d But the comparison is disputed, and not apples-to-apples.\n\u2022 Booker said when Connecticut enacted a permit-to-purchase gun law, \u201cthey saw 40 percent drops in gun violence and 15 percent drops in suicides.\u201d Two studies did find an association with such drops in gun violence and suicides, but they didn\u2019t say the decline was caused by that law.\n\u2022 Former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke misleadingly said Purdue Pharma had paid \u201cno consequences \u2026 not a single night in jail\u201d for its connection to the opioid crisis. There hasn\u2019t been jail time but the company and executives have agreed to pay hundreds of millions in fines and settlements.\n\u2022 Booker also said \u201cabout 30 percent of LGBTQ kids \u2026 do not go to school because of fear,\u201d a statistic backed up by a 2017 survey that found those students missed one day of school or more in the prior month.\n\nThe first debate was hosted by NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo on June 26, with another 10 candidates set to debate the following night.\n\nModerator Lester Holt asked all 10 candidates if they would, as president, \u201csign on to the 2015 nuclear deal as it was originally negotiated.\u201d Only Sen. Cory Booker said no.\n\nBooker said he would renegotiate the agreement, but he criticized President Donald Trump for announcing on May 8, 2018, that the U.S. would withdraw from the agreement.\n\nIn criticizing Trump, Booker garbled the facts about the impact of the agreement on the \u201cbreakout time,\u201d which is how long it would take Iran to produce enough highly enriched uranium for one nuclear weapon.\n\nThe Iran agreement pushed the breakout time from roughly two or three months to one year for at least 10 years, according to the Obama White House.\n\nIn years 11 to 15 of the agreement, the breakout time would be reduced to less than one year because Iran would be \u201cpermitted to replace its first-generation centrifuges with limited numbers of advanced models, although the restrictions on enriched ura\u00adnium stocks and enrichment level continue through year 15,\u201d as explained in an August 2015 report issued by the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University a month after the U.S. and other nations announced the agreement.\n\nThe point of extending the breakout period is to give the international community enough time to react \u2014 if Iran moves ahead with production of a nuclear weapon.\n\n\u201cSome contributors to this report believe that breakout time by year 15 could be comparable to what it is today \u2014 a few months \u2014 while others believe it could be reduced to a few weeks,\u201d the Harvard report said. \u201cIn any event, Iran is unlikely to attempt breakout at Natanz during this period because detection would be swift and the risk of provoking a military attack would be high. Since all enrichment will be limited to Natanz for 15 years under the JCPOA, Iran\u2019s nuclear program would be vulnerable to military attack.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter 15 years, all physical constraints on enrichment imposed by the agreement will be lifted,\u201d the Harvard report said.\n\nRep. Tim Ryan of Ohio falsely said: \u201cThe bottom 60 percent haven\u2019t seen a raise since 1980.\u201d Analyses of Census data by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service and the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank that advocates for low- and middle-income workers, show there has been a rise in inflation-adjusted wages over that time period, even if the percentage increase was relatively small, especially compared with the 90th percentile of workers.\n\nRyan, however, didn\u2019t comment on the magnitude of the wage increase. He said there hasn\u2019t been an increase at all.\n\nIn a 2019 report, EPI showed that every percentile had seen a cumulative percentage increase in real (inflation-adjusted) hourly wages from 1979 to 2018, with considerably higher increases for high-income earners. The 50th percentile experienced a 14% increase, and the 70th percentile saw a 17.1% increase. The 10th percentile saw just a 4.1% increase, while the 95th percentile saw its wages grow by 56.1%. (See Appendix Figure B.) \u201cRising wage inequality and sluggish hourly wage growth for the vast majority of workers have been defining features of the American labor market for nearly four decades, despite steady productivity growth,\u201d the report began. It continued: \u201cWhat also stands out in this last year of data is that, while wages are growing for most workers, wage growth continues to be slower than would be expected in an economy with relatively low unemployment.\u201d\n\nAnother EPI report (see Figure A) shows the real wage change for the 60th percentile from 2000 to 2018 (4.9 percent) and from 2007 to 2018 (2.1 percent). The upper-percentiles did considerably better. \u201cBecause of the recent uptick in wages for the 20th through 40th percentiles over the last year on top of steady increases over the last few years at the 10th percentile, wage growth is in the rough shape of a checkmark with stronger growth at the bottom attributed to several consecutive years of state-level minimum wage increases and a growing economy, while the fastest growth at and near the top is a continuation of the trends in growing inequality since the 1970s,\u201d EPI wrote in a report that noted \u201ca steadily improving economy should eventually translate into stronger wage growth.\u201d\n\nThe Congressional Research Service used the same Census dataset to analyze the wage trends from 1979 to 2017. The report found that the 50th percentile experienced a cumulative 6.1% growth over that time period, with men in that percentile actually seeing a decrease of 6% while women saw a 25.5% increase. \u201cIn summary, analysis of the data shows that overall wages rose in real terms over the 1979 to 2017 period at the top of the wage distribution, increased slightly at the middle of the wage distribution, and rose to an even lesser degree at the bottom of the distribution.\u201d\n\nWe reached out to Ryan\u2019s campaign to ask for the source of his claim, but we did not receive a response.\n\nBooker used a common but disputed comparison to justify his support for \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that the most recent Trustees Report of the Medicare system puts total \u201cadministrative expenses\u201d at $9.9 billion last year. That\u2019s actually 1.3 percent of total Medicare expenditures for the year \u2014 even less than the 2 percent figure Booker cited. So far, so good.\n\nBut is Medicare really as economically efficient as that small number suggests? Hardly. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (a nonpartisan arm of Congress) estimates that in fiscal year 2017 Medicare made $52 billion in \u201cimproper payments,\u201d including those that were fraudulent or erroneous. Spending more on administration might cut losses from waste and fraud.\n\nIt\u2019s also true that the health insurance industry says that in 2014 through 2016 an average of 18.2 cents of every private premium dollar went for things other than doctors, hospitals and other health-care services. But by no means can all of that be called \u201coverhead.\u201d An average of 4.7 cents went for federal, state and local taxes, for example.\n\nMost of the remaining 13.5 cents clearly falls under the heading of \u201coverhead,\u201d including 3.3 cents for \u201cfees and business expenses\u201d; 2.3 cents for \u201cprofit\u201d; 1.8 cents for \u201ccustomer engagement\u201d; 1.6 cents for \u201cfinance, claims and special investigations; 0.7 cent for \u201cadministrative.\u201d\n\nBut the 13.5 cents also includes 1.6 cents for \u201ccare management,\u201d a category that includes health coaching and wellness programs aimed at improving customer health and thus reducing claims. If those expenses are considered to be benefits, then the \u201coverhead\u201d total shrinks to 11.9 cents.\n\nAnd there\u2019s another problem with Booker\u2019s comparison: Medicare beneficiaries are all age 65 or over, or disabled, and on average have much larger medical bills than the mostly under-65 population served by private health insurance. A 2006 study estimated that in 2003, the average medical cost for Medicare was $6,600 per person per year while the average medical cost for private health insurance (excluding out-of-pocket costs) was less than half that \u2014 $2,700 per person per year.\n\nSo $1 spent on overhead for Medicare automatically becomes a smaller percentage of total spending than does $1 spent on overhead for private insurance. And that also means that if Medicare were extended to \u201call\u201d the percentage spent on overhead would rise.\n\nOur conclusion: Booker and others using this and similar claims have a point \u2014 Medicare does spend less on administration than private insurers. But it\u2019s not so simple as they would have you believe.\n\nIn discussing the nation\u2019s opioid crisis, former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke offered a misleading take on a pharmaceutical company linked to the epidemic.\n\n\u201cDespite what Purdue Pharma has done \u2014 their connection to the opioid crisis and the overdose deaths that we\u2019re seeing throughout this country \u2014 they\u2019ve been able to act with complete impunity and pay no consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cNot a single night in jail.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s accurate that no one from the company, the manufacturer of the addictive painkiller Oxycontin, spent time in jail. But it\u2019s inaccurate to say \u201cthey\u2019ve been able to act with complete impunity and pay no consequences.\u201d\n\nIn 2007, the company and three executives pleaded guilty in federal court to charges relating to \u201cmisbranding\u201d OxyContin. Collectively, they agreed to pay more than $634 million in fines and other payments \u2014 what was described by the New York Times as \u201cone of the largest amounts ever paid by a drug company in such a case.\u201d\n\nStates also have recently taken action against the company: In March, the Oklahoma Attorney General\u2019s Office reached a $270 million settlement with Purdue after alleging the company and others were to blame for the state\u2019s opioid epidemic.\n\nBooker cited studies that showed that when Connecticut enacted a permit-to-purchase gun law, \u201cthey saw 40 percent drops in gun violence and 15 percent drops in suicides.\u201d Two studies did find an association with such drops in gun violence and suicides, but they stopped short of claiming the decline was caused by that law in Connecticut. And there\u2019s also some evidence states with similar laws have seen less dramatic results.\n\nCurrently, 10 states have enacted permit-to-purchase laws that require gun purchasers to obtain a permit or license, and three states require a license to own firearms, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nBooker\u2019s claims about the effect of the permit-to-purchase law passed in Connecticut in 1995 come from two studies. The first, published in the in 2015 concluded that \u201cthe law was associated with a 40% reduction in Connecticut\u2019s firearm homicide rates during the first 10 years that the law was in place.\u201d The second, published in Preventive Medicine in 2015, found a 15.4% reduction in suicide rates associated with Connecticut\u2019s law (and a rise in suicide rates in Missouri after it repealed its permit-to-purchase law).\n\nSo Booker\u2019s statement is accurate. But both studies cited an association, and stopped short of concluding that the decline was caused by those laws.\n\nIn addition, researchers caution not to put too much stock in the results in any one state or city, as it is notoriously difficult to tease out the effects of various gun policies in states that often have a combination of policies. Results are further complicated because some states with strong gun policies are bordered by states that may or may not have similar policies. In other words, results in Connecticut may not be representative of how the law might affect gun crimes in other areas.\n\nAnother study, one that looked at licensing laws in large, urban counties around the U.S., found that permit-to-purchase laws \u201cwere associated with a 14% reduction in firearm homicide.\u201d And a study published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine in March found that universal background checks \u2014 either at the point of purchase or through a license/permit application \u2014 were associated with about a 15 percent reduction in homicide.\n\nIn the course of demonstrating his support for the LGBT community, Booker said, \u201cWe don\u2019t talk enough about how many children, about 30 percent of LGBTQ kids, who do not go to school because of fear.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a valid source for the statistic, but it could use some context. We asked Booker\u2019s campaign for a source for the number and were directed to an NBC News story about the 2017 GLSEN National School Climate Survey, which found that 35% of LGBTQ students missed one day of school or more in the prior month because of feeling unsafe at school.", "lang": "en"}
