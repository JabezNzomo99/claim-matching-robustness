The photograph has been doing the rounds on social media with a heartwarming message that states how a mother infected with COVID-19 wished to see her child for the last time before she died. The message, when translated to Hindi, reads, \"Very disheartening incident. Italy's female corona patient was in the third stage which is the last prior to death. In front of her 18-month-old child who was crying a lot. She expressed her last wish in front of the doctor that she wanted to hug her child once. The doctors covered her entire body with wax and rested her child on her chest. The baby was quite soon after. And the mother left the world.''\n\nBOOM ran a reverse search and found the image in the stock of Magnum Photos, an archive of photographs from across the world. The image was clicked at a cancer treatment centre in Seattle, USA by veteran photojournalist Burt Glinn just before stem cells transplant in 1985. The caption of the image reads, \"USA, SEATTLE, WASINGTON, 1985. Fred Hutchinson CancerCenter- Infant inside Laminar Air Flow Room protection from infection. The child has been irradiated prior to marrow transplant.\"\n\nRenowned photo-journalist Burt Glinn, who died in 2008 chronicled Cold War through his lense. The same features in his photobook which includes1959 photographs of Fidel Castro. The image has earlier debunked on 28 March 2020 by Egypt's Elwatannews.", "lang": "en"}
