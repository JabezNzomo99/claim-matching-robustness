Russian commentators have scoffed at the concerns, and pointed to a NATO build-up on their borders.\n\nYet there is good reason to suspect the drills could preclude something more sinister. In July 2008, Russia\u2019s 58th Army finished the Kavkaz-2008 exercises July 31 and then a few days afterward \u200binvaded their neighbor Georgia; in March 2014, Russia massed 150,000 troops near the Ukrainian border which were later used not only in actual combat missions inside Ukraine (notably in the Battle of Ilovaisk in August 2014) but came and went over the following years to keep Kyiv under pressure.\n\nThen, as now, some Western leaders and analysts said the masses of troops at the Ukrainian border were not yet prepared for an invasion, or were \u201cbehaving normally\u201d for troops needing to keep readiness or that Russia has the right to move its troops within its borders.\n\nBut in fact, in April 2014 some of those Russian forces did find their way into Ukraine and also served as backup for thousands of fighters -- locals as well Russian contract soldiers and \u201cvolunteers\u201d - to take over hundreds of administrative buildings all over eastern Ukraine.\n\nAleksandr Grushko, Russia\u2019s ambassador to NATO was quoted by TASS August 2 as saying that the political situation in Europe was \u201cseriously worsening\u201d and that there was a \u201cpump-up of arms and armor by the NATO countries on the eastern flank\u201d over the \u201ccontrived pretense of a Russian threat\u201d.\n\nSuch statements hinge on the ability of Russian commentators to persistently deny and obfuscate the reality of Russian troops and tanks in eastern Ukraine, as well as the Kremlin\u2019s past behavior in Georgia, and to leave out the context of reduced Western military spending in recent decades and an imbalance between European and Russian military capacities.\n\nAs Polygraph.info has reported in the past, Russian tanks and troops already significantly outnumber those of NATO countries. As Kurt Volker, the new US special envoy to Ukraine noted in an interview with RFE/RL,\"There are more Russian tanks in there [Ukraine] than [tanks] in Western Europe combined.\u201d That means even with the US helping to bolster the forces of the Baltic states before these September Russian maneuvers, there is still no parity with Russia.\n\nTo be sure, Zapad-2017 will need to be watched carefully to ensure that justified fears do not cloud reporting of actual events. Recently, posts appeared on Facebook expressing the fears of Belarusian citizens that Russia was already sending \u201clittle green men\u201d or military personnel without any identifiable chevrons into their country, as they had done in Crimea in February 2014.\n\nBut after some debate and comparison of a number of photos of soldiers from Belarus along with knowledge about the locality, Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Lab concluded that the soldiers in the photos were in fact from a Belarusian unit.", "lang": "en"}
