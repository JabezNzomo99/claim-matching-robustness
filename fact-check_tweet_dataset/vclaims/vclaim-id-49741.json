The claim is false; the audio in the video has been doctored to include messages of support for the law; the original video shows the Philippine stars voicing opposition to the law.\n\nThe video was published on Facebook here on July 8, 2020. It has been viewed more than 43,000 times.\n\nThe six-minute 12-second clip shows Philippine celebrities, artists and public officials speaking to the camera, followed by interviews about the country\u2019s recently enacted anti-terrorism law.\n\nThe post\u2019s Tagalog-language caption translates to English as: \"Famous stars and other prominent personalities expressed support for the Anti-Terror Law. / #JunkTerror #SupportAntiTerrorLaw\".\n\nThe claim circulated online just days after Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte signed a law on July 3, 2020 that gives Philippine security forces sweeping powers target terrorists, but which critics warn could be used to crackdown on opponents of the government, AFP reported here.\n\nThe same video was also shared here and here on Facebook alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the video has been doctored.\n\nKeyword searches on Google found the video in the misleading posts corresponds to this footage posted to Facebook on July 6, 2020.\n\nContrary to the claim in the misleading posts, the original video calls for the abolishment of the Philippines\u2019 controversial anti-terror law. The Facebook post's caption states in part: \u201cThe Great Dictator Speech #JunkTerrorLaw #UnitedForDemocracy\u201d.\n\nThe video shows the same group of people reciting a Tagalog-language translation of Charlie Chaplin\u2019s famous speech in the movie \u201cThe Great Dictator\u201d, which advocates for citizenry over dictatorship.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading posts (L) and the original video (R):\n\nAFP analysed how the audio in the original video has been altered. The manipulated sections include:\n\n1. At the five-second mark of the original video, actor John Lloyd Cruz says: \"I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t want to be a dictator.\"\n\nBut in its corresponding portion in the misleading video, at the six-second mark, the dubbed audio states: \"I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t want to be a terrorist.\"\n\n2. At the original video\u2019s one-minute 38-second mark, human rights lawyer Chel Diokno says: \u201cMore than knowledge, we need goodness of heart and kindness.\u201d\n\nThat was dubbed with \u201cMore than knowledge, goodness of heart is needed, support anti-terror law\u201d, as heard at the one-minute 39-second mark of the misleading video.\n\n3. In the original video, at the one-minute 29-second mark, Jose Luis Martin C. Gascon, chairperson of the Philippine Commission on Human Rights, can be heard saying: \u201cWe think too much, that we have almost lost our feelings.\u201d\n\nBut in the doctored video, at the one-minute 30-second mark, the audio was dubbed to state: \u201cThey have too much rage, let us crush the terrorist.\u201d\n\nGascon told AFP in a text message on July 16, 2020: \u201cConcerned citizens from different sectors participated in the rendering of a filipino version\u2026 of Charlie Chaplin's piece in the Great Dictator\u2026 That now there are unknown & nefarious elements who would twist the truth in this manner without the decency & courtesy of informing those same participants reflects a desperate attempt at obfuscating the public discourse on this.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
