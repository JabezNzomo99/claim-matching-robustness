The audio of the 'Imperial March' seems to have been taken from a recording of the tune being played outside Buckingham Palace posted in 2006.\n\nAs noted by Snopes, Mr Trump was actually played a medley of US military anthems. The actual music replaced from the viral clip was \u2018Anchors Aweigh\u2019. You can see the original footage here or watch the full performance here.\n\nThis is not the first time a visit from Mr Trump has been linked to the Star Wars music. In 2018 a recording of the theme was also added to a video of the President and Prime Minister Theresa May.", "lang": "en"}
