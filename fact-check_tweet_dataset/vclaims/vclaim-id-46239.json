(There is a clue in the date, which follows the American style of putting the month number before the day number.)\n\nIt is called the \u201cSecure 5G and Beyond Act of 2020\u201d and it is about ensuring the security of 5G technology in the US and globally. It requires the President to develop a strategy for making this happen. One of its stated aims is also to \u201cprotect the competitiveness of United States companies\u201d working on 5G.\n\nIt's worth bearing in mind that while the Act was signed into law during the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 on 23 March \u2013 it was going through the US legislative process for nearly a year. It was first introduced into the US Senate in March 2019, and was scrutinised by lawmakers in the months that followed.\n\nThe post goes on to make several further claims about the supposed dangers of 5G technology, which are also not true. The false rumour that 5G radio waves pose a risk to human health is a common conspiracy theory, which we have written about many times before.", "lang": "en"}
