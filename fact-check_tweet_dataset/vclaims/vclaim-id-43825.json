The media outlet\u2019s founder Rahul Roushan tweeted the poster and wrote, \u201cIslam crushing Hinduism.\u201d\n\nOther usual suspects were Shefali Vaidya, Vivek Agnihotri and The Frustrated Indian.\n\nA similar assertion was raised by CVoter founder, Yashwant Deshmukh and media outlet My Nation.\n\nThe symbol on the poster is not the \u2018Swastika\u2019 but the hooked-cross adopted by the Nazi Party. The most visible feature in the usual depiction of the Hindu Swastika is the four dots between the arms of the cross which are absent in the Nazi symbol. Furthermore, the Nazi symbol is rotated at an angle of 45 degrees.\n\nThe Nazi symbol is commonly used to protest or express resistance by protestors across the world. Below is a photograph where the symbol was used on a black flag during a protest in China where protestors popularised the term \u2018Chinazi\u2019.\n\nProtestors have also used the Nazi symbol to agitate against US president Donald Trump.\n\nNeo-Nazi groups still associate themselves with the hooked-cross.\n\nThat the symbol on the poster represents the Hindu \u2018Swastika\u2019 is a false claim viral across social media platforms. One Rajan Thakur who identifies himself as a BJYM UP coordinator on Twitter shared the photograph with the exact words used by Sambit Patra.\n\nAnother user Ajay Raghuwanshi whose Twitter bio reads \u2018BJP social media\u2019 also shared the image.\n\nThe claim is viral on Twitter and Facebook.\n\n[Update 1: Republic\u2019s broadcast, OpIndia\u2019s report and tweets by Amish Devgan Rahul Roushan, Shefali Vaidhya, Vivek Agnihotri and The Frustrated Indian have been added to the report.\n\nUpdate 2: Photographs showing the use of the Nazi symbol by protestors across the world were added to the report on January 17, 2020.]", "lang": "en"}
