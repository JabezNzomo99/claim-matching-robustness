You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here.\n\nYour News Wire, a website that often posts misleading and fake news, repeated information from the conservative website Breitbart, which celebrated a recent drop in CNN\u2019s ratings.\n\nYour News Wire used real data from Ad Week to show a 29 percent primetime rating drop during the second week of May compared to the same week last year. Then the story declared that as a result of the \"nosedive\" in ratings \"the failing news network may be about to come to an abrupt end.\"\n\nThe story included a photo of what appears to be a CNN studio going up in flames but had no evidence that the network has shut down or plans to do so.\n\nWhile a ratings drop or spike by a network can be used by networks to boast about their position, ratings for a short period of time don\u2019t reveal much about a network\u2019s viability. Networks sell ads on longer-term data, so a drop in ratings over a couple of weeks may not mean much. Ratings also must be examined based on news events during the time period in question -- it's built into the business model that some news weeks are slower than others.\n\nFor example, during the week of May 8-14, 2017, President Donald Trump fired FBI director James Comey and former acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified to a Senate panel about Michael Flynn, a former Trump adviser, in the Russia saga.\n\nThe idea that CNN would shut down is a bit of a fantasy for conservatives who share Trump\u2019s allegation that the network is \"fake news.\"\n\nWhile Trump uses the term \"fake news\" to describe news coverage that is unsympathetic to his administration and his performance, at PolitiFact we refer to fake news as fabricated content that intentionally masquerades as news coverage of actual events. Statements by Trump have been named PolitiFact\u2019s Lie of the Year award twice.\n\nYour News Wire said in a headline \"CNN to permanently close its doors as ratings plunge 30 percent.\" While the ratings drop during the second week of May compared to a year ago is real, the conclusion that CNN is going out of business is nonsense.
