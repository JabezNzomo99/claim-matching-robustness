But as this year\u2019s overtime session wound down, Corcoran touted the overall level of spending the Legislature approved for schools in a May 6, 2017, tweet:\n\nThat $24 billion is for all education spending that isn\u2019t for colleges and universities, but also includes $419 million in HB 7069. That 278-page bill was negotiated behind closed doors in Tallahassee near the end of this year\u2019s budgeting process.\n\nIt covers everything from virtual learning to testing reforms to teacher bonuses. One of the most contested components is $140 million for the \"schools of hope\" program, largely to attract privately managed charter schools to compete with near-failing schools in poor neighborhoods.\n\nGiven the heated debate on school funding, we wondered whether the 2017-18 state budget really contained \"the greatest investment in education in Florida history,\" or if there\u2019s more to the balance sheet we should consider.\n\nAs a quick overview, the most common measure of education spending is the Florida Education Finance Program (FEFP), the main source of dollars for K-12 education. When most people discuss K-12 school funding, this is what they are talking about.\n\nBy law, it\u2019s a combination of state and local funding. Each school district must contribute property tax dollars, called the \"required local effort,\" in an amount dictated by the state. In recent years, the state has also received federal stimulus dollars.\n\nFor 2017-18, the Legislature increased the base education budget, or FEFP, from about $20.2 billion to $20.4 billion.\n\nIn the current school year, spending is about $7,196 per pupil. The 2017-18 budget raises that to about $7,221 per student, a 0.34 percent increase. The small change has drawn jeers from educators and parents, and is $200 less than the $7,421 amount Gov. Rick Scott requested in his proposed budget.\n\nCorcoran is talking about more than the FEFP to reach his total.\n\nHis $24 billion figure includes several allocations for multiple programs outside the FEFP, and technically is the total for voluntary pre-kindergarten, as well as other programs including mentoring services and grants.\n\nWe requested analyses from both the House and Senate on both sides of the aisle, and they came up with roughly the same figures: The entire education budget for the next fiscal year \u2014 including the FEFP, grants, special programs and more \u2014 is about $14.7 billion in state funds (including $3.2 billion from state trust funds), plus another $9 billion from the required local effort. That\u2019s a total of $23.7 billion, give or take a few estimated millions.\n\nWhen you add HB 7069\u2019s $419 million to that, you get about $24 billion.\n\nCorcoran spokesman Fred Piccolo said that $24 billion outstripped all education funding from prior years, topping the current fiscal year\u2019s $23.4 billion. He sent us a list of 10 years\u2019 worth of spending, but would not specify what programs his office was counting when they compiled the figures.\n\nBut that\u2019s okay, because we don\u2019t need to look at every program. Even with its tiny increase for next year, the FEFP is slated to be the highest it\u2019s ever been. It\u2019s been on the rise the last few years, after Scott cut education spending when he took office after the 2008 recession.\n\nNow for the caveats.\n\nFirst of all, one would expect the FEFP to go up a bit each year, because generally the total number of students in Florida schools continues to increase. For 2017-18, the state projects an increase of about 300,000 students.\n\nThat means despite a small funding increase, many school districts will actually see total allocations drop.\n\nFurthermore, Florida\u2019s per-pupil spending lags far behind the national average of about $10,700 (a total that has been dropping in recent years). And even then, the per-pupil amount is less than $100 more than what it was a decade ago, and certainly has not kept up with inflation.\n\nPer-pupil spending would have to be roughly $8,358 next fiscal year to simply equal the 2007-08 level, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator.\n\nWe also must note that unlike FEFP money, HB 7069\u2019s cash is going to very targeted programs, like scholarships for disabled youth (initiated by former Senate President Andy Gardiner), Best and Brightest scholarships for teachers, and incentives for charter schools.\n\nThat money also isn\u2019t guaranteed, because Scott has to sign it first. School officials across the state, from Miami-Dade to Polk County and beyond, have called for Scott to veto the bill because they say it doesn\u2019t adequately address their needs.\n\nCorcoran tweeted that at $24 billion, the House has made \"the greatest investment in education in Florida history!\"\n\nIn sheer dollars, that appears to be the case in large part because the Legislature agreed to an incremental bump in funding. Even if Scott doesn\u2019t sign HB 7069, which targets very specific programs, the main state-local funding source alone is still at the highest total it\u2019s ever been.\n\nBut it's not a runaway difference. Compared with the current year, the per-pupil increase is less than one-half of 1 percent.\n\nThe increases that do exist won't affect every school district equally, and some counties likely will see less money because of how the state allocates school funds. Corcoran is also including spending that hasn't yet been approved by the governor.\n\nThe claim loses even more luster when taking into account that Florida's education spending, already lower than the national average, hasn\u2019t kept up with inflation for years. The next fiscal year is no different.\n\nThe statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.", "lang": "en"}
