No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to educate gullible Trump supporters and Republicans about the need to actually click and read links before sharing or liking them in order to avoid being embarrassed by fans of the site later. All the events described in the article are not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on May 21, 2019 titled \"Panel of 16 Judges Agrees: Barr Has Enough to Indict Clinton and Obama\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nA panel of 16 judges convened yesterday to process the information available to Attorney General Barr and their conclusion was unanimous: There is plenty of evidence to indict Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for Conspiracy to Create a False Conspiracy, a 2nd-degree felony with a 10-year mandatory minimum. The judges all agreed that the initial dossier narrative used to obtain a wiretap of the Trump campaign was most likely bogus and that the conclusions inferred from any evidence gathered from them is, therefore, fruit of the poisonous tree and not admissible in court. The Trump Administration was quick to issue a statement through Director of Information and Propaganda, Art Tubolls: \"We are as pleased as ever that we are once again shown to have never done anything outside the law -- ever. At this point, President Trump is innocent of so many things it will be difficult to justify how he couyld possibly be guilty of anything.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nIt was published under the category \"Satire and/or Conservative Fan Fiction\" and the name Art Tubolls used in the story is an anagram for \"Busta Troll\", the nickname of the owner of the site.\n\nThe site is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run byself-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine and his partner in crime John Prager along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other fact checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction to this he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry extremely visible disclaimers everywhere.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up. That happened in this case too:\n\nBlair and his operation were profiled by the Washington Post on November 17, 2018 by Eli Saslow:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nWe wrote about tatersgonnatate.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: 243 Angry Passengers NOT Grounded In Iowa After Nancy Pelosi's Drunken Rampage\n\u2022 Fake News: Nancy Pelosi's Husband Did NOT File for Divorce, Did NOT Say 'I just Can't Take It Anymore'", "lang": "en"}
