It quotes Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman claiming during her maiden budget that BJP government has distributed 35,000 crores LED bulbs in the country. A twitter handle @AlkaMaverickposted the screenshot with the message, \u201c\u092f\u0947 LED \u092c\u0932\u094d\u092c \u0915\u093f\u0938\u0915\u094b \u092e\u093f\u0932\u093e \u0939\u0948???? \u092e\u0941\u091d\u0947 \u0924\u094b \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u092e\u093f\u0932\u093e..\u0906\u092a\u0915\u094b??? (Who got this LED bulb? I didn\u2019t get it, did you?)\u201d.\n\nThe comments of several users on Facebook and Twitter testify that many people believed the Finance Minister to have made the statement.\n\nPreeti Chobey, the national executive member of the Samajwadi Party, also tweeted the same screenshot and took a jibe at the ruling party.\n\nUpon watching the complete July 5 budget speech of Nirmala Sitharaman, Alt News found that the figure cited by CNBC Awaz was incorrect. In her speech, the Finance Minister claimed that 35 crore (and not 35,000 crore) LED bulbs were distributed in the country.\n\nIn the video posted below, Sitharaman can be heard saying at 1:06:48, \u201cApproximately 35 crore LED bulbs have been distributed under UJALA Yojana, leading to cost saving of Rs 18,341 crores annually.\u201d\n\nThe same was cross-checked with the text of her speech available on Indiabuget.gov.in, the official website of the Union Budget under the GOI\u2019s Finance Ministry.\n\nAlt News contacted a source within CNBC Awaaz who informed that \u201c35,000\u201d LED bulbs was a typo made during the broadcast and was corrected soon after it came to the organisation\u2019s notice.\n\nIn conclusion, a screengrab of CNBC Awaaz\u2019s broadcast, where the news channel had mistakenly quoted the FM, was circulated on social media to question and target the BJP government.", "lang": "en"}
