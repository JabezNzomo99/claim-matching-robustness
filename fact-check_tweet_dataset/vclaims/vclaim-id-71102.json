In this item, we\u2019ll look at whether it\u2019s correct that \"a little less than 50 percent of the people in this country depend on some form of federal payment, some form of government benefit to help provide for them.\"\n\n \n\n We\u2019re going to ignore Santorum\u2019s focus on what will happen within \"the next two years,\" since we don\u2019t have a crystal ball. But we think the most recent data can serve as a fair stand-in instead.\n\n \n\n For that, we can use a table produced by the U.S. Census Bureau that offers data for the average number of Americans who received benefits from selected government programs during a three-month period between January and March 2010.\n\n \n\n The table includes such non-means-tested programs as Social Security, Medicare, unemployment compensation, veterans' compensation, workers' compensation, railroad retirement and veterans' educational assistance. It also includes such means-tested programs as Medicaid, food stamps, the Women, Infants, and Children program, federal Supplemental Security Income, public or subsidized rental housing, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, free or reduced-price school breakfasts and lunches, energy assistance and other cash assistance.\n\n \n\n The Census Bureau found that a little over 147 million Americans received payments from at least one of these programs at a time when the U.S. population was just over 303 million. This meant that 48.5 percent of Americans received federal cash or cash-like benefits -- and it means that Santorum\u2019s number is well-supported. In fact, counting such items as amounts refunded from the Earned Income Tax Credit or agricultural subsidies -- neither of which are included in these figures -- would push that number higher.\n\nOur colleague at the Washington Post Fact Checker concluded that the usefulness of these numbers is weakened because they count everyone in a household as benefiting from a particular federal payment even if that payment is made in the name of only one person. We think that's a fair point, although we would add that if a couple and their two children live under the same roof as grandma, and she receives Social Security and Medicare, those federal benefits add to the resources available to the rest of the family. And if a child gets free school lunches, his parents will have more disposable income as a result.\n\nOur ruling\n\n \n\n The percentage of Americans \"who depend on some form of federal payment\" is indeed \"a little less than 50 percent,\" as Santorum said -- it was 48.5 percent in 2010. If anything, the ongoing rise in usage of food stamps and other federal assistance programs may have pushed this number higher, and adding in tax refunds from the Earned Income Tax Credit or agricultural subsidies could push the number higher still.\n\nThe number, however, includes every member of a household in which one member receives benefits, and in some households, it would be a stretch to say, as Santorum does, that as a result of that every member will \"depend on some form of federal payment.\" Discounting for that, we rate Santorum\u2019s statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
