Giuliani and Dyson talked over each other for most of the 2-minute banter. Eventually, Giuliani uttered the line that went viral almost immediately (\u201cWhite police officers wouldn\u2019t be there if you weren\u2019t killing each other.\u201d) and Dyson fired back at the \u201cdefensive mechanism of white supremacy at work in your mind, sir.\u201d (That comment also was picked up widely by Dyson\u2019s critics.)\n\nThe \u201cMeet the Press\u201d segment immediately gained attention against the backdrop of a grand jury contemplating whether to charge the white police officer in the Aug. 9, 2014, shooting of a black teenager. The shooting prompted angry residents to demand justice for Brown and alleging racism. Local police responded to the outraged demonstrations with military equipment \u2014 raising more questions over police brutality.\n\nShowing a map of cities with the greatest discrepancy between the police racial makeup and the community they serve, Todd asked: \u201cAll of those could be future Fergusons. How do you make a police force that looks like the community they serve?\u201d\n\nThe rate of intraracial homicide in the black community is the reason for the heavy police presence, Giuliani said, and it should be the subject of discussion because it\u2019s so much more prevalent than the shooting of a black victim by a white police officer.\n\nIn an interview with The Fact Checker, Giuliani agreed that most murders, black or white, are intraracial. Asked why he didn\u2019t note the other half of the statistic in his interview, Giuliani said there \u201care very few\u201d white intraracial murders compared to black intraracial murders.\n\nIt is true that the rate of black homicide victims and offenders were disproportionately represented compared to the general population, the 2011 BJS report found. The black victimization rate (27.8 per 100,000) was six times higher than the white victimization rate (4.5 per 100,000). Black offending rate (34.4 per 100,000) was almost eight times higher than whites (4.5 per 100,000), according to the report.\n\n\u201cThe danger to a black child in America is not a white police officer. That\u2019s going to happen less than 1 percent of the time. The danger to a black child \u2026 is another black,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cIf my child was shot by a police officer, I would be very, very frustrated. I\u2019d also be frustrated if my son was shot by a gangster in the street. But if the chances were \u2014 that my son would be shot by the gangster in the street \u2014 nine times out of 10, I\u2019d spend an awful lot of time on the nine times out of 10.\u201d\n\nWhere did he get the \u201cless than 1 percent\u201d figure? Giuliani said it was his estimation of the percentage of deadly force by white police officers on black victims, which he described would be a small portion of the percentage of white-on-black murders.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to accurately measure the rate of homicides by police in the United States. The FBI maintains a limited database of self-reported and conservative estimates. But a ProPublica analysis of federal data from 2010 to 2012 found young black males were 21 times more likely to be killed by police than their white counterparts.\n\nStatements like Giuliani\u2019s perpetuate stereotypes that criminalize black people, he said. And to Giuliani\u2019s point about focusing on violence in the black community, Dyson said there are countless marches and rallies against violence within the black community. But most don\u2019t get the attention that events like Ferguson do.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s statistic is rooted in Department of Justice studies. But it lacks significant context \u2014 especially because race relations and police treatment of minorities are complex and emotionally-charged topics. We also found it difficult to support Giuliani\u2019s personal estimation of the rarity of deadly force by white police officers on black victims, but were limited by the unreliable data on homicides by police.", "lang": "en"}
