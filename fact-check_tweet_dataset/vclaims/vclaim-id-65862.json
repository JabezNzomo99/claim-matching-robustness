Mayor Muriel Bowser \u201cwouldn\u2019t let the D.C. Police get involved\u201d with a recent protest near the White House.\n\nStatements from the Secret Service and Bowser indicate that D.C. police were on the scene. The chief of police said his department established \u201cunified command\u201d with the Secret Service and Park Police and provided some equipment to the Secret Service.\n\nProtests and riots have erupted in cities across the U.S. following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis police custody after an officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes, according to video of the incident. On May 29, protesters gathered outside the White House, which was briefly put on lockdown, with some pushing at barricades erected by the Secret Service and throwing things, the Washington Post reported.\n\nTrump praised the Secret Service\u2019s response to the protests on Twitter the following day, adding, \u201cOn the bad side, the D.C. Mayor, @MurielBowser, who is always looking for money & help, wouldn\u2019t let the D.C. Police get involved. \u2018Not their job.\u2019 Nice!\u201d\n\nBut Trump\u2019s claim doesn\u2019t hold up. The Secret Service said in a May 30 statement regarding the previous night\u2019s protests that the \u201cMetropolitan Police Department and the U.S. Park Police were on the scene.\u201d Reporters at the scene also noticed a D.C. police presence at protests.\n\nBowser refuted Trump\u2019s claim in a press conference the following day. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims MSNBC Aired \u2018World War Z\u2019 Clip During George Floyd Protest Coverage)\n\n\u201cNo one needed to ask the Metropolitan Police Department to get involved, because we were already involved,\u201d she said. \u201cOur police were doing their jobs from the start. D.C. Police supported uniformed Secret Service last night like we have done literally dozens of times at Lafayette Park.\u201d\n\nD.C. Chief of Police Peter Newsham told reporters at the same news conference that his department established \u201cunified command\u201d with the Park Police and Secret Service and even provided Secret Service agents with equipment they didn\u2019t have, such as helmets.\n\nThe White House did not return a request for comment.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
