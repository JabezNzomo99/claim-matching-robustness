Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral post is fake.\n\nA post shared on Twitter claims that scientists discover how a class a drug can eradicate and epidemic.

We did not find any authentic report which states that cocaine cures coronavirus.\n\nVishvas News found a report on the website of World Health Organization (WHO). As per WHO, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the novel coronavirus.\n\nIt further states that some specific treatments are under investigation and will be tested through clinical trials.\n\nWe searched for the photo used in the viral post using Google Reverse Image Search. The format of the image which appears to be a news bulletin was created using certain meme generators.\n\nWe also tried finding the source of the image of cocaine that was used in the viral post.\n\nWe found the same photo uploaded on istockphoto, bigstockphoto, and adobe stock. It is a copyrighted image. The photo did not feature in any news website as a coronavirus cure.\n\nVishvas News spoke to Dr. Vimal N. of Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India, \u201cThis is a fake news. There is no evidence or research supporting this claim. There is no cure of novel coronavirus so far as also stated by WHO.\u201d\n\nVishvas News has earlier debunked fake and misleading posts related to coronavirus.
