During the campaign, several participants publicly displayed affection to stand against moral policing. The movement was strongly opposed by right-wing groups.\n\nThis is not the first time H Raja has been called out for his dubious tweets. In the past he shared a fake Tamil quote attributed to Google CEO Sundar Pichai.\n\nHe also created a stir when he tweeted a photo of a voter ID card of actor Vijay and a letter that the actor had written to a Tamil publication. Both had Vijay's full name 'C Joseph Vijay'; which Raja used to 'prove' that Vijay is a Christian. Vijay's film 'Mersal' had created a controversy as it contained dialogues that were critical of Goods and Services Tax (GST), which ruffled feathers among the ruling-BJP party.\n\nNote: The story has been updated to include the response of the photographer.", "lang": "en"}
