It has also been included in listicles such as \u201cHair Was Big And Bigger In The 1960s\u201d and \u201c30 Big Hairstyles From the 1960s That You Probably Wouldn\u2019t Wear Today.\u201d\n\nWhile some may find this hairdo plausible for the era, this is not a genuine photograph. This picture has been altered to make \u201cKaren\u2019s\u201d hair just a tad bit bigger. Yes, this bouffant is bogus.\n\nThe original photograph was reportedly taken sometime in the 1960s and shows a woman in a kitchen opening a box. While the woman in the original photograph certainly had large hair, it\u2019s not nearly as big as the bouffant shown in the viral picture.\n\nHere\u2019s a side-by-side comparison showing how this woman\u2019s hair was digitally embiggened to Marge Simpson proportions:", "lang": "en"}
