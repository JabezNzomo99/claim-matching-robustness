Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: IAF Wing Commander Abhinandan\u2019s wife requests the Modi government not to politicize the sacrifices of the soldiers Fact: The woman shown in the video is not IAF Wing Commander Abhinandan\u2019s wife. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe woman shown in the video is Sirisha Rao (Boom Live has used advanced searches to find the identity of the woman and contacted her to confirm that she was the one in the video). In the video, she says that she is a wife of an Indian army officer; but Abhinandan is an Indian Air Force Wing Commander. So, it can be concluded that she is not the wife of Abhinandan. Also, she has clarified on her Twitter account that her identity has been forged.\n\nFinally, the video posted on Facebook as Wife of Abhinandan complaining on BJP is false.", "lang": "en"}
