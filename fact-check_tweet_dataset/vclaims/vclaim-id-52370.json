Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral post is fake.\n\nThe post doing rounds on social media reads: \u201cCASHEWS are natural anti-depressants. 2 handfuls of cashews is the therapeutic equivalent of a prescription dose of PROZAC.\u201d The archived version of the post can be checked here.\n\nVishvas News investigated and found an article online published on the website doctoryourself.com. The article titled \u201cAn alternative to Prozac\u201d read: \u201cone big handful of cashews provides one to two thousand milligrams of tryptophan, which will work as well as prescription antidepressants\u2026 but don\u2019t tell the drug companies.\u201d\n\nOn searching the details of the author of the article, Vishvas news found that Dr. Andrew Saul who related Cashews and Prozac for tryptophan content is a Nutritionist and not a Psychiatrist.\n\nAs article on Medical Daily states that although Cashews can help in natural mood-lifting to reduce depression, the claim that two handfuls of Cashews can become the therapeutic equivalent of a prescription dose of Prozac in treating depression is questionable. We researched and found no medical documentation supporting the viral claim.\n\nThe detailed fact check on the report can be checked here.\n\nWe spoke to Dr. Anil Yadav, who is a Psychiatrist at AIIMS, Delhi. He said, \u201cProzac is an anti-depressant and cashews cannot replace them. This is not true that two handfuls of cashew can replace Prozac.\u201d\n\nThe post is shared on Facebook by a user named Desiree Hall. We scanned the social profile of the user and found that the user is followed by 1,402 users.\n\nConclusion: Post claiming two handfuls of cashews is equivalent to a prozac dose is fake.", "lang": "en"}
