Vishvas News investigated and found that the claim is false.\n\nA Facebook post claims that any type of poison (from snake poison to celphos poison) can be cured on call immediately. The contact numbers were also mentioned on the viral post: 9893905661, 9754304435, 9425460326, 9753367868 and 9826430189. The post had been shared by a Facebook user named Shivraj Yadav. The post has 223 reactions, 25 comments, and around 7200 shares.\n\nVishvas News started the investigation by calling the numbers mentioned on the viral post.\n\nWe called up the first number 9893905661. The incoming calls were not available on this number as it wasn\u2019t recharged, as per IVR.\n\nWe tried calling the second number 9754304435. As per IVR, the number does not exist.\n\nVishvas News called up the third number 9425460326 as mentioned in the viral post. The number was received by someone. Upon asking how they cure poison over call, a person said that he chants a mantra on phone to the patient. When we further enquired he disconnected the call and switched off his phone.\n\nThe fourth number we tried calling 9753367868 was switched off.\n\nAnd the last number 9826430189 was also switched off.\n\nBy talking on one of the numbers mentioned in the viral post it was clear that they chant a mantra on the phone which they say can treat any type of poison.\n\nWe then searched online that whether all types\u2019 of poisons can be cured by chanting a mantra. There were some reports which stated that in ancient times, some people used to chant mantras and followed some treatments for treating poison.\n\nWe further researched and found a report on the official website of bombayhighourt.nic.in. As per Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act, 2013, the bill criminalises the following act: Prohibiting and preventing a person from taking medical treatment in case of dog, snake or scorpion bite and instead giving him a treatment like mantra-tantra, ganda-dora or such other things.\n\nWe further investigated by contacting National Poison Informatics Centers of AIIMS. Dr Swati Sharma of AIIMS stated that: There is a proper treatment for poison. Doctors contact them for treatments and they provide suggestions. The treatments need to be followed properly. One cannot treat any deadly poison just by saying something to the patient on call.\n\nWe scanned the profile of the Facebook user Shivraj Yadav who had shared the post. The user belongs to Guna district of Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe post claiming that any type of poison can be cured by calling to the numbers given on the Facebook post is false.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right.
