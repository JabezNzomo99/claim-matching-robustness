It is a social evil and such a stigma that we still hear about such incidents. (Our) heads hang in shame, it hurts, but today, death sentences (\u092b\u093e\u0902\u0938\u0940) in three days, in seven days, in eleven days, in a month. We are continuously taking steps to ensure justice for those daughters and the results are evident. It is unfortunate for the country that TV channels run news about incidents of rape for seven days, but news about death sentencenews about death sentence verdicts never gets prominence.\n\nThe official Twitter handle of BJP misquoted Modi\u2019s statement by saying, \u201c\u0932\u0947\u0915\u093f\u0928 \u0906\u091c \u0905\u092a\u0930\u093e\u0927\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b 3,7,11,30 \u0926\u093f\u0928 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092b\u093e\u0902\u0938\u0940 \u0939\u094b\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948 (But today culprits are being hanged in 3, 7, 11, 30 days -translated)\u201d. As stated in the complete translation above, he was referring to the death sentences awarded within a month of the crime, and NOT the execution itself.\n\nANI has also misquoted the Prime Minister by stating, \u201cNow, culprits are hanged within 3 days, 7days, 11 days & a month.\u201d Reading the translation, it is evident that \u201cFansi\u201d was translated to word \u201changed\u201d, whereas it should have been \u201cdeath sentence\u201d in context of the statement. A little later in his speech, PM Modi refers to Fansi ki sazaa (death sentence).\n\nHere, PM Modi was referring to the cases in which death sentence was pronounced in record timings by the local courts. A few such instances are presented below.\n\nIn August 2018, a local court in Madhya Pradesh had sentenced a man to life-imprisonment for raping a six-year-old girl. A report published by The Indian Express on August 8, 2018 stated, \u201cDatia Additional Sessions Judge Hitendra Dwivedi awarded life sentence to Motilal Ahirwar (25) after convicting him under section 376 (A)(B) of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance 2018 introduced recently as well as provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, prosecution officer Pushpendra Kumar Garg said\u201d. The trial was completed in three working days.\n\nAnother local court in Indore, Madhya Pradesh had sentenced a man to death for raping and killing a three-month-old girl near Rajwada. An article published by The Times of India stated, \u201cThe death sentence will be executed after it is confirmed by the high court\u201d. The accused was convicted within a record 21 days.\n\nIn July 2017, Rajkumar Kol, an autorickshaw driver was sentenced to death for raping a minor by a court in Katni, in Madhya Pradesh after a trail that lasted for five day.. \u201cHe was arrested on July 7. Police filed the chargesheet on June 12 and the hearing on the case started on June 23.\u201d, stated a Times of India report published on July 27, 2018. Three months later, reports emerged that the Madhya Pradesh High Court had commuted the death sentence to rigorous imprisonment for 20 years. In two more individual rape cases from Rajasthan and Karnataka, culprits were awarded a death sentence within 22 days.\n\nHence, the statement made by Modi does not tally with the figures. However, he is not entirely off the mark in stating that death sentences have been pronounced within a month of the commitment of a crime of rape.\n\nAccording to a IndiaSpend report, a total of 109 prisoners were sentenced with capital punishment in the year 2017, out of which 43 were sentenced to death for murder involving sexual offences, with the main offence being rape along with murder. It also stated, \u201cThis was up 79% from 24 persons who were awarded the death sentence for similar crimes in 2016.\u201d\n\nScenario of capital punishment in India in last 14 years\n\nConsidering the broad principle laid out by the Supreme Court in which only crimes related to the \u2018rarest of the rare\u2019 category qualify for capital punishment, the number of capital punishment cases across the country are few. Furthermore, the process from trial to execution is tedious. This is due to mercy petitions filed in several cases, which are at the discretion of the President.\n\nInsofar as the execution of death sentence is concerned, only four convicts have been hanged to death since 2004, with the most recent case of Yakub Memon, sentenced for his role in the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts case. The most recent instance of capital punishment for rape dates back to 2004, when Dhanonjay Chatterjee was hanged for the rape and murder of a teenage girl in Kolkata in 1990. Chatterjee\u2019s trial had lasted nearly 14 years before he was finally sent to the gallows.\n\nThe last \u2018Crime in India\u2019 report published by the National Crime Record Bureau, an organisation under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) was for the year, 2016. According to the \u2018Crime in India\u2019 for 2016, the number of cases reported in 2016 was 38,947 whereas cases pending for investigation from previous years was 16,124. The total number of cases under investigation for the year 2016 was 55,071. It also may be noted that 1,52,165 cases were awaiting trail. The latest NCRB statistics was published in 2016. Even if we assume that the number of rape cases have remained largely the same in the past 3 years, the prime minister\u2019s conclusion that the state of criminal justice system has drastically improved is a stretch. PM Modi\u2019s reasoning is based on only selected cases of expedited sentencing.\n\nNarendra Modi\u2019s suggestion that the justice system in India, especially for crime against women, has improved significantly based on the selective cases where rape accused have been sentenced in an expedited fashion, is grossly misleading. However, the Prime Minister had been misquoted by ANI and amusingly, by his own party. In his speech, he was referring to \u2018death sentences\u2019 and not \u2018hangings\u2019.\n\nIn the past, Alt News had published a detailed analysis by Dr Jaydip Sarkar, where he analysed if capital punishment is the solution to rising sexual crimes against women and concluded that it is not. Jaydip Sarkar has been involved in the assessment of certain high-profile criminal cases in India and previously trained in London handling cases with the New Scotland Yard. He has special clinical interest in the assessment and management of sex offenders, both in secure care as well as community with a range of external stakeholders.", "lang": "en"}
