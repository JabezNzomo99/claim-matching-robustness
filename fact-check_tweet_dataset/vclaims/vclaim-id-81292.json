The EPA has proposed regulations to limit carbon dioxide emissions from new coal plants: no more than 1,100 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour of power produced, compared to an average of 1,400 to 1,700 for current new coal plants.\n\nThe precise number will vary by plant whether it\u2019s subcritical or supercritical, by coal rank, and about the kind of technology used. Typically we expressed these costs as a range. So for the first generation technology that the Dr. Klara was mentioning earlier, we\u2019re looking at something on the order of $70 to $90 a ton. In that context, that looks something like a 70 or 80 percent increased on the wholesale price of electricity. For the second generation technologies which we\u2019re developing, it\u2019s our strong expectation that number will be roughly half. We\u2019ll be looking at something like a four-year $50 a ton cost.\n\nBut reporters missed the fact that later in the hearing Friedmann clarified that, in giving these estimates, he was referring to \u201ca high fraction of capture \u2014 basically 90 or 95 percent capture.\u201d (He also made a distinction between a coal gasification facility, where full recapture could initially boost wholesale costs by 40 percent, and a pulverized coal power plant, which could boost wholesale costs as much as 80 percent.)\n\nIn other words, the \u201c80 percent\u201d estimate had nothing to do with the EPA rule. Indeed, Bloomberg noted that by contrast the EPA has proposed requiring all new coal plants to trap \u201csome carbon-dioxide emissions.\u201d The EPA rules also make clear the agency rejected \u201cfull recapture\u201d (above 90 percent) because it would be too costly (see pages 30-31), which is why it instead proposed \u201cpartial recapture\u201d CCS technologies.\n\nMeanwhile, note that Friedmann was referring to wholesale price estimates. Even if he had been talking about the impact of the EPA regulations, it is quite a stretch to assume that any increase in costs at a plant would translate into the exact same increase at the retail level, given that utilities often have a fleet of power generation plants \u2013 such as existing coal plants, natural gas plants, nuclear plants, or wind and solar facilities. Rates, in other words, would not be based on a single new power plant that uses carbon capture technologies. (EPA has not released proposed rules for existing power plants, but officials have said the rules would not require CCS technologies.)\n\nNancy Gravatt, NMA spokeswoman, defended the ad. \u201cThe \u201880 percent increase\u2019 was widely quoted in all the media and widely covered, it is not something we misconstrued or misquoted,\u201d she said. \u201cThe doubling of a person\u2019s electricity bill is our best estimate on what the impact might be for an average consumer based on realistic scenarios. It\u2019s based on analyzing the impact of EPA regulations, which are taking out the nation\u2019s most low-cost electricity, which is coal-based and purchased on long-term stable contracts, and replacing with other, less predictable and more costly sources that are often purchased on the spot market.\u201d\n\nShe pointed to a Los Angeles Times article about \u201ca growing fragility in the U.S. electricity system\u201d as a \u201cresult of the shutdown of coal-fired plants, reductions in nuclear power, a shift to more expensive renewable energy and natural gas pipeline constraints.\u201d California\u2019s electricity prices could increase 47 percent over the next 16 years, the article said, citing a study, though that figure also stems from \u201cheavy investments in transmission lines\u201d and other factors.\n\nThere\u2019s little justification for this radio ad to claim that people will see their electric bills nearly double because of the EPA rules on new coal plants. The NMA has seized upon a high-end wholesale estimate for \u201cfull recapture\u201d carbon capture and sequestration technologies which the EPA specifically rejected \u2014 and then leveraged that factoid to make a wholly unsupported claim that the same increase would be reflected in retail prices.", "lang": "en"}
