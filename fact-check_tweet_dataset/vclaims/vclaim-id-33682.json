My husband received a notice that something is wrong with our account and the link given doesn\u2019t go to an actual Netflix website. They ask for all the profile information including a credit number and info. I checked the actual website and our account is in good standing and all the info is accurate.\n\nThis is not a genuine email from Netflix. This email is an attempt to steal credit card information and is known as a phishing scam.\n\nPhishing scams use various forms of bait (hence the name) in an attempt to trick people into giving up personal information, such as passwords or credit card information. These scammers may promise a prize, such as a cash giveaway, in order to entice people to give up their information. Or, as in this case, pose as a trusted company.\n\nThis Netflix phishing scam has been circulating since at least 2017. In December 2018, so many people had reported they were targeted with a version of this scam that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a statement called \u201cNetflix phishing scam: Don\u2019t take the bait\u201d:\n\nPhishing is when someone uses fake emails or texts to get you to share valuable personal information \u2013 like account numbers, Social Security numbers, or your login IDs and passwords. Scammers use your information to steal your money, your identity, or both. They also use phishing emails to get access to your computer or network. If you click on a link, they can install ransomware or other programs that can lock you out of your data. Scammers often use familiar company names or pretend to be someone you know. Here\u2019s a real world example featuring Netflix. Police in Ohio shared a screenshot of a phishing email designed to steal personal information. The email claims the user\u2019s account is on hold because Netflix is \u201chaving some trouble with your current billing information\u201d and invites the user to click on a link to update their payment method.\n\nReaders can find additional tips on how to spot and respond to this scam here. The FTC has also published a few tips on how to spot similar scams, which we\u2019ve reproduced below:\n\nHow to Recognize Phishing\n\n Scammers often update their tactics, but there are some signs that will help you recognize a phishing email or text message.
