As part of this visit, the Japenese PM was accompanied to various historical places in Ahmedabad including Sabarmati Ashram and the 16th century Sidi Saiyyed Mosque. Now, a rumour is rife in Ahmedabad that believers were prevented from offering namaz at the Sidi Saiyyed Mosque in Ahmedabad due to PM Modi\u2019s visit. Former IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt wrote on his Facebook profile, \u201cBelievers weren\u2019t allowed to offer regular Namaz at Sid Saiyyed Mosque Ahmedabad for the last few days in order to facilitate this Tamasha\u201c.\n\nTo inquire into this issue, we spoke to the authorities who were co-ordinating the efforts regarding PM Modi and Japenese PM Shinzo Abe\u2019s visit to the historical mosque. Rizwan Qadri who is the President of Ahmedabad Sunni Muslim Waqf Committee (Trust) told Alt News that no such disruption of namaz occured. He further stated that initially the time proposed by the PMO for PM\u2019s visit was 6:35 which was in conflict with the \u201cMaghrib\u201d Namaz. This conflict of time was intimated to the PM\u2019s office and the final schedule of PM\u2019s visit did not conflict with the namaz time.\n\nRizwan Qadri further stated that he himself participated in the namaz and the local police ensured that nobody had any issues regarding the same. The trust had also circulated the following WhatsApp message in Gujarati informing people that no namaz times were affected due to PM Modi\u2019s visit, \u201c*\u0a85\u0ab8\u0acd\u0ab8\u0ab2\u0abe\u0aae\u0ac1 \u0a85\u0ab2\u0aaf\u0a95\u0ac1\u0aae* *\u0a85\u0ab9\u0aae\u0aa6\u0abe\u0aac\u0abe\u0aa6* \u0a95\u0ac0 \u0ab6\u0abe\u0aa8 \u0a8f\u0ab8\u0ac0 *\u0ab8\u0ac0\u0aa6\u0acd\u0aa6\u0ac0 \u0ab8\u0ac8\u0aaf\u0aa6 \u0aae\u0ab8\u0acd\u0a9c\u0abf\u0aa6 \u0aae\u0ac7 \u0a88\u0aa8\u0acd\u0ab6\u0abe\u0a85\u0ab2\u0acd\u0ab2\u0abe\u0ab9 \u0aaa\u0abe\u0a82\u0a9a\u0acb \u0ab5\u0a95\u0acd\u0aa4 \u0a95\u0ac0 \u0aa8\u0aae\u0abe\u0a9c \u0aae\u0ac1\u0a95\u0ab0\u0ab0 \u0a95\u0abf\u0aaf\u0ac7 \u0a97\u0aaf\u0ac7 \u0ab5\u0a95\u0acd\u0aa4 \u0ab8\u0ac7 \u0ab9\u0ac0 \u0ab9\u0acb\u0a97\u0ac0* \u0a89\u0ab8 \u0aae\u0ac7\u0a82 \u0a95\u0acb\u0a88 \u0a95\u0abf\u0ab8\u0aae\u0a95\u0abe *\u0aac\u0aa6\u0ab2\u0abe\u0ab5* \u0aa8\u0ab9\u0ac0 \u0ab9\u0acb\u0a97\u0abe \u0ab9\u0aae\u0abe\u0ab0\u0ac7 *\u0aaa\u0ac0.\u0a8f\u0aae \u0aae\u0acb\u0aa6\u0ac0 \u0a9c\u0ac0 \u0aa8\u0ac7 \u0a89\u0aa8\u0a95\u0ac7 \u0a86\u0aa8\u0ac7\u0a95\u0abe \u0ab5\u0a95\u0aa4 \u0a8f\u0ab8\u0ac7 \u0aae\u0ac1\u0a95\u0ab0\u0ab0* \u0a95\u0abf\u0aaf\u0abe \u0ab9\u0ac7 \u0a95\u0ac0 *\u0aa8\u0aae\u0abe\u0a9d* \u0aae\u0ac7\u0a82 \u0a86\u0aa8\u0ac7 \u0ab5\u0abe\u0ab2\u0ac7 *\u0aa8\u0aae\u0abe\u0a9d\u0ac0* \u0a95\u0acb \u0a95\u0acb\u0a88 \u0aa4\u0a95\u0ab2\u0ac0\u0aab \u0aa8\u0ab9\u0ac0 \u0ab9\u0acb\u0a97\u0ac0. *\u0a9f\u0acd\u0ab0\u0ab8\u0acd\u0a9f\u0ac0* *\u0a85\u0ab9\u0aae\u0aa6\u0abe\u0aac\u0abe\u0aa6 \u0ab8\u0ac1\u0aa8\u0acd\u0aa8\u0ac0 \u0aae\u0ac1\u0ab8\u0acd\u0ab2\u0ac0\u0aae \u0ab5\u0a95\u0aab \u0a95\u0aae\u0abf\u0a9f\u0ac0*\u201c.\n\nAlt News also spoke with the owner of New Golden Furniture Sabir Hussain Mansuri who offered namaz at Sidi Saiyyed mosque after PM\u2019s visit. He confirmed that there was no disruption and everything was handled very smoothly. Alt News further spoke with various journalists who covered the event and they reiterated that social media rumours about namaz being disrupted were false.\n\nIt is absolutely irresponsible on part of those who circulate such rumours on social media without cross-checking facts. Such rumours lead to communal polarisation. As it is, we are living in times when the strife between various religious/cultural communities is alarmingly high. We do not need social media rumours to further magnify this divide.", "lang": "en"}
