I don\u2019t know anything about him. Somebody told me yesterday, whoever he is, he did endorse me. Actually I don\u2019t think it was an endorsement. He said I was absolutely the best of all of the candidates.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Jake Tapper: \u201cI want to ask you about the Anti-Defamation League, which this week called on you to publicly condemn unequivocally the racism of former KKK grand wizard David Duke, who recently said that voting against you at this point would be \u2018treason to your heritage.\u2019 Will you unequivocally condemn David Duke and say that you don\u2019t want his vote or that of other white supremacists in this election?\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201cWell, just so you understand, I don\u2019t know anything about David Duke. Okay? I don\u2019t know anything about what you\u2019re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know, did he endorse me or what\u2019s going on, because, you know, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists. And so you\u2019re asking me a question that I\u2019m supposed to be talking about people that I know nothing about.\u201d\n\nTapper: \u201cBut I guess the question from the Anti-Defamation League is, even if you don\u2019t know about their endorsement, there are these groups and individuals endorsing you. Would you just say unequivocally you condemn them and you don\u2019t want their support?\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201cWell, I have to look at the group. I mean, I don\u2019t know what group you\u2019re talking about. You wouldn\u2019t want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about. I would have to look. If you would send me a list of the groups, I will do research on them. And, certainly, I would disavow if I thought there was something wrong.\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201cI\u2019m sitting in a house in Florida, with a very bad earpiece that they gave me, and you could hardly hear what he was saying. But what I heard was \u2018various groups.\u2019 And I don\u2019t mind disavowing anybody and I disavowed David Duke. And I disavowed him the day before at a major news conference\u2026. I have no problem disavowing groups, but I\u2019d at least like to know who they are. It would be very unfair to disavow a group if the group shouldn\u2019t be disavowed. I have to know who the groups are. But I disavowed David Duke.\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201cOf course, I am. I mean, there\u2019s nobody that\u2019s done so much for equality as I have. You take a look at Palm Beach, Florida, I built the Mar-a-Lago Club, totally open to everybody; a club that frankly set a new standard in clubs and a new standard in Palm Beach and I\u2019ve gotten great credit for it. That is totally open to everybody. So, of course, I am.\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201cWe had a news conference and they asked me the exact same question. I said I disavow. Now, right after the program that we\u2019re talking about \u2014 and I thought it was clear, but you know, we\u2019re talking about groups, groups, groups. I do have to know the name of the group because, who knows? I mean, they have to give me the name of the group. But right after, when I reviewed it, I put out a tweet and I put out on Facebook that I totally disavow. Now everybody knew I did that but the press refused to look at that. It was right after. And I disavowed then; I disavowed today on ABC with George Stephanopoulos, I disavowed again. I mean, how many times are you supposed to disavow? But I disavow and hopefully it\u2019s the final time I have to do it. But if you look at Facebook and if you look at Twitter, right after the show I put out a statement because I want everybody to be sure.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
