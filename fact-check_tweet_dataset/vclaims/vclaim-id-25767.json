No, that's not true, there is no such song or video. The \"news\" about it was made up by a \"fauxtire website\" that got inspired by a poster to Reddit's \"Onion Headlines\" board. The news is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by 8Shit on October 1, 2018 titled \"Machine Gun Kelly Releases New M&M Diss Track Stating That He Prefers Skittles\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nMachine Gun Kelly went after M&M again. This time he disses M&M in a brand new (and not old) diss track, claiming that he prefers Skittles. M&M was born in 1941, whereas Skittles was born in 1974. \"About to be 77 years old, dog\", MGK claims in his new diss track. Even though M&M has sold more candy and has a wider market, Skittles is performing very well in the market, and is the favorite of many people.\n\nKelly (real name Richard Colson Baker) has a major beef with Eminem which culminated in him releasing the song \"Rap Devil\" mocking Em's status as \"Rap God\":\n\nBut the story about the new Skittles themed song came from the subreddit /r/onionheadlines on Reddit, where a user named \"amerikitch\" proposed following headline:\n\nMachine Gun Kelly releases new M&M diss track stating that he prefers Skittles. * r/onionheadlines Reddit gives you the best of the internet in one place.
