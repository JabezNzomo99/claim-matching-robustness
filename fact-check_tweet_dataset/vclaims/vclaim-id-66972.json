This is false; most trees from the last garden overhaul had been changed at least twice before, a report on the redesign shows, and roses are changed regularly, a landscape architect who worked on the project said.\n\n\u201cThose were Jackie Kennedy\u2019s crabapple tree\u2019s. Many of those rose bushes were from ALL the First Ladies of America, going all the way back to Ellen Louise Wilson in 1913,\u201d said a tweet that was shared as a screenshot on Facebook.\n\nThe tweet featured photos of the White House Rose Garden before and after the latest redesign. Other social media posts accuse the first lady of removing cherry trees or of gutting former first lady Jackie Kennedy\u2019s garden tribute to her husband John F. Kennedy, murdered in 1963.\n\nHowever, a landscape architect for the project rejected the claims.\n\n\u201cThere is just so much being said that is so ill-informed that it\u2019s hard to even begin to address it,\u201d Perry Guillot, who heads one of the two landscape architecture firms contracted for the project, told AFP by phone.\n\nThe new design of the White House Rose Garden was revealed to the press on August 22, 2020, just two days before the start of the Republican National Convention. President Trump closed it on August 27 with a speech on the South Lawn, directly across from the garden, a noted break from past conventions that Democrats said raised ethical questions.\n\nThe garden\u2019s redesign was formally announced on July 27, 2020. \u201cDecades of use and necessary changes made to support the modern presidency have taken a toll on the garden,\u201d the press release said.\n\nThe last major work on the garden took place in 1962 during the Kennedy presidency, and gave the blueprint for the garden\u2019s current presentation. That was one year prior to John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination in Dallas, which rules out claims that the garden was a tribute to the late president.\n\n\u201cThere were no cherry trees,\u201d Guillot said. Claims that \u201ccherry blossom trees\u201d were removed may have resulted from people misidentifying the crabapple trees that were present and whose white blossom looks similar to cherry trees.\n\nThe White House Rose Garden Landscape Report, which outlines and explains the recent redesign, lists all 11 tree species in the garden, which does not feature cherry trees. The same list shows each time a tree was replaced and under whose administration. While the crabapple trees were first planted in 1962 under Jackie Kennedy, they were replaced under presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump, before being removed in 2020. \u201cThis is all in keeping with the life of gardens, in which a design is retained while plant materials must be renewed,\u201d the report says.\n\nIt is true that the crabapples were removed. \u201cThere are two parterres and it was decided not to reinstall the crabapples in the parterres at this time,\u201d Guillot said, adding this was done to give the garden a more robust collection of roses in those beds.\n\n\u201cWhile the inclusion of crabapples in the Garden dates to 1962, the current trees do not necessarily themselves contribute to the Rose Garden\u2019s list of character defining features,\u201d the report explains, adding that some crabapples have been removed by the creator of the garden\u2019s modern iteration, landscape architect Rachel Mellon, in order to provide more direct sun to roses growing below.\n\nThe roses themselves, although paramount to the garden\u2019s aesthetic, were not planted by all first ladies since 1913, nor are the ones from that era still in present today.\n\n\u201cThere was not a rose in that garden older than 10 years old,\u201d Guillot said.\n\n\u201cNothing was done in a rushed manner,\u201d he said, unhappy with online criticism.\n\n\u201cEverything was very well studied and deliberated before changes were made,\u201d by the committee for the preservation of the White House, which featured 10 external advisors from the horticulture and landscaping fields.", "lang": "en"}
