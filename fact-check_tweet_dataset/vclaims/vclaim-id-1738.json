We will be fighting first and foremost to do something for the 30,000 EU nationals living in this country which have a terrible shadow of uncertainty over them.\u201d\n\nThe figure Ms Abbott uses is wrong.\n\nAround 3.2 million people living in the UK in 2015 were citizens of another EU country\u2014about 5% of the UK population.\n\nSome of them face an uncertain future in the UK, because we don\u2019t yet know what arrangements the UK will make after free movement of citizens comes to an end. The government has so far signalled it aims to protect the long-term status of EU residents here.\n\nFigures from a few years ago suggested that just over half of them arrived between 2006 and 2014.\n\nWe\u2019ve written about this before in our piece on EU immigration into the UK.\n\nFigures for 2015 suggest that 1.2 million people born in the UK live in other EU countries, and we\u2019ve looked at those estimates in detail before too.\n\nFor the moment we\u2019re assuming that the mistake was a slip of the tongue, but we\u2019ve asked Ms Abbott if she meant to refer to something more specific.", "lang": "en"}
