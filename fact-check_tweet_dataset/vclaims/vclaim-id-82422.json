See how one religious group has attacked and destroyed a temple and burned an idol of Maa Kali in Murshidabad area of West Bengal. Shameful,\" Singh's tweet reads.\n\nIdol of Hindu deity Kali in a temple in West Bengal's Murshidabad district was burnt by the Muslim community. The claim is false. On the night of August 31, an idol of Goddess Kali caught fire in Kali Maa Nimtala Kalimandir in Alampur village of Murshidabad, West Bengal. The secretary of the temple, Shukdev Bajpayee, confirmed to India TV that the idol got burnt due to an accident. \"It looks like a case of an accident. Even we were wondering how it happened. The temple was locked, no items have been lost and the idol was intact,\" he said. In a formal statement, the temple authority further clarified that on the night of August 31, the Kali idol got burnt. According to them, Hindus and Muslims in the area \"have extremely cordial relations\". \"Both communities believe that this cannot be an act of religious hatred. However, there are some who are trying to give it a communal spin. We urge everyone to refrain from indulging in anything that fuels tension,\" the statement further reads.\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343.\n\n Also Read: Fact Check: Old Photo Shared As Hindu Doctor Cremated By Muslims In Pune", "lang": "en"}
