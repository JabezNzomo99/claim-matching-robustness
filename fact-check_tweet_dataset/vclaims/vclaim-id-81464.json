Lula was president from 2003 to 2010 is currently campaigning ahead of elections in October, despite a corruption conviction that bars him for running for office.\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald reported that at shots were fired on least two buses in Lula's convoy according to his Worker's Party, though Lula was not on the bus at the time of the attack.\n\n\"His buses have already been pelted with eggs and stones along the campaign trail. But wherever he goes, supporters also line the streets to urge him on.\" - The Sydney Morning Herald\n\nThe reception meted out to five-time champions Brazil after their 2-1 loss to Belgium in Kazan, Russia was not as bad as the video made it seem.
