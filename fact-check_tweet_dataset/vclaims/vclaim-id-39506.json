There aren\u2019t official figures on how many private hospitals are registered as charities, but one estimate by the same company suggests that around a quarter are.\n\nBusiness rates are a tax on non-domestic properties, for example shops, offices and warehouses, across the UK. To calculate how much needs to be paid in business rates you take the rateable value\u2014the amount the property would cost to rent annually\u2014and multiply that by a pence per pound value. For 2017/18 this value in England was 49.3p, giving a tax bill of around half of the rateable value.\n\nNHS hospitals have to pay it, as do most other buildings occupied by public bodies. The government said in early 2017 it had \u201cno plans\u201d to exempt NHS hospitals from these payments, and its position seemed unmoved in 2018.\n\nRateable values in England, Wales and Scotland are normally updated every five years. Most recently they were revalued in 2015, and these changes came into effect from April 2017. The total amount of business rate revenue collected must remain the same after a revaluation, so if the rateable values of properties go up, the pence per pound value must go down to balance that out.\n\nHospitals in England receive most of their funding from NHS England and ultimately central government (mostly from general taxation). These hospitals then pay business rates to councils, which keep some of the money to spend on services and give the rest back to the government. The government then redistributes that money to other councils using the Barnett formula, which is designed to distribute based on need.\n\nHave hospitals faced a 21% hike in their business rates tax bill?\n\nThis claim comes from research done by property consultants CVS in January 2017, before the latest business rate revaluation took effect. CVS have since been acquired by another company, Altus Group.\n\nAltus Group told us the 21% figure came from projections of what the average annual business rate bill for all England and Wales NHS hospitals would look like after the 2017 revaluation, compared to what they paid in 2016/17. That was their estimate when the revaluation cycle was expected to last five years.\n\nAltus said the rateable values (that\u2019s how much the buildings would cost to rent) for NHS hospitals in England and Wales increased by 19% in the revaluation. We found roughly the same thing from published figures. Altus told us they have access to an \u201cup-to-date real time\u201d list.\n\nThat amounts to 21% higher actual business rate payments a year, according to the research, from around \u00a3303 million to \u00a3366 million. That took into account transitional relief (cash from the government used to soften the blow of suddenly increasing business rate bills) plus the then-forecasts for inflation.\n\nBut they told us that research is now out of date, since the Chancellor announced the next revaluation would be brought forward a year to 2021. This means the current valuation cycle will last four rather than five years, which changes the tax bill because of transitional relief and inflation.\n\nAltus Group projects that the 2019/20 bill will be \u00a3386 million, which they say is a rise of around 24% compared to what hospitals would have paid in 2016/17. This isn\u2019t calculated in quite the same way as the 21%, but it still represents the scale of increased costs the hospitals are facing.\n\nIn 2017, the government said it didn\u2019t know how much more NHS hospitals would have to pay when the rates changed.\n\nA bill introduced by an MP which would exempt NHS hospitals from business rate charges is due to be debated by parliament in October 2018.\n\nWhat can private hospitals do?\n\nCharities can apply for charitable business rate relief of up to 80% if their property is used \u201cfor charitable purposes\u201d. The government has confirmed private hospitals registered as charities can also do this.\n\nCharities in England and Wales are allowed to make a profit from selling goods and services to customers, and some private schools, galleries that charge for entry and private hospitals do. To qualify as charities these groups must prove they are \u201cfor the public benefit\u201d and have only \u201ccharitable purposes\u201d. Private hospitals may adhere to these criteria by having a purpose of \u201cadvancing health or the saving of lives\u201d and arguing they do that by treating some members of the public.\n\nThe government said in 2017 that it didn\u2019t know how many private hospitals are registered as charities.\n\nThe same company, CVS, used Freedom of Information requests to come up with an estimate of 27% of private hospitals being registered as charities. We\u2019ve asked the Altus Group for more information on this.", "lang": "en"}
