But it did not make the entrepreneur a Russian spy.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "February 25, 2019", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-12351", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/elon-musk-and-russian-propaganda-fact-check/29790260.html", "vclaim": "Russia\u2019s third largest TV channel NTV recently tweeted a video at Elon Musk showing a rear-driving car, modified by a young student in the southern Stavropol region, asking, \u201cHow do you like this?\" He replied, \u201c\u0425\u0430\u0445\u0430 \u043e\u0444\u0438\u0433\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u201d [Haha freaking cool] --- in Russian.\n\nThe brief interaction caused a storm of media headlines and trended on social media in Russia for several days, with prominent figures half-jokingly claiming Musk was Russia\u2019s spy who has just burned his cover. \u201cOurs,\u201d they crowed.\n\n\u201cAgent Musk burned hard,\u201d the chief editor of Russia Today and Sputnik, Margarita Simonyan wrote in her Telegram channel posting a screenshot of NTV tweet with Musk\u2019s reply.\n\nMany compared Musk with the fictional Soviet spy in the fascist Germany, a KGB agent posing as SS officer Max Otto von Stierlitz during the final days of the Third Reich.\n\nThe numerous responses including NTV\u2019s own posts threw in the Russian possessive pronoun \u201c\u041d\u0430\u0448\u201d [Ours], giving a base for this fact check even if the claims seemed to be mere jokes.\n\n*Note: In Russian, pronouns have forms, in gender the letter \u201ca\u201d added to the end i.e. \u201cnasha\u201d (in Cyrillic Ha\u0448a) signifies \u201cfemale\u201d while \u201cnash\u201d (Ha\u0448 in Cyrillic) is a male; and the letter \u201ci\u201d at the end shows it\u2019s plural (\u041d\u0430\u0448\u0438 -- nashi).\n\n\u201cAlthough the third-person possessive is used in this way in other countries as well, I have noticed over the past quarter century that it is used much more often in Russia than elsewhere,\u201d Mark Kramer a Harvard University professor told Polygraph.info.\n\n\u201cJournalists and scholars in Russia routinely use \u2018nashi\u2019 when referring to \u2018rossiiskie\u2019 (Russians) and sometimes they'll use just \u2018nashi,\u2019 as in \u2018amerikanskie voiska\u2019 (American troops) versus \u2018nashi\u2019 or \u2018inostrannye studenty\u2019 (foreign students) versus \u2018nashi.\u2019 Because of this cultural trait, the use of \u2018nashi\u2019 in propaganda slogans seems perfectly normal,\u201d Kramer noted.\n\n\u201cIn essence, we can think of \u2018nashi\u2019 (ours) vs. \u2018chujie\u2019 (aliens), as a simplified method for mass consumption of creating a mental map of kinship, ownership and cohesion too,\u201d Dr. Kiril Avramov, fellow at the Intelligence Studies Project at the University of Texas, told Polygraph.info.\n\nClaiming \u2018ownership\u2019 over foreign celebrities \u2013 such as in the case of Musk, or foreign land \u2013 \u041a\u0440\u044b\u043c\u041d\u0430\u0448 (Crimea is ours, most popular in 2014), \u0414\u043e\u043d\u0431\u0430\u0441\u0441\u041d\u0430\u0448 (Donbass is ours), \u0421\u0438\u0440\u0438\u044f\u041d\u0430\u0448\u0430 (Syria is ours) foreign politicians \u2013 i.e. \u0422\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043f\u041d\u0430\u0448 (Trump is ours, most popular in 2016) \u2013 is nothing new in Russia. On the contrary \u2013 over the two decades of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s reign the word [\u043d\u0430\u0448] in its various forms has become paramount in the Kremlin\u2019s domestic propaganda and a key social magnifier.\n\nToday using [\u043d\u0430\u0448] is a declaration of one belonging in a \u201cright\u201d side of the Russian society \u2013 being patriotic and proud of his country and supportive of his government, which also means being pro-Putin.\n\nThe term \u201cnicely fits with the craft of \u2018weaponized narratives,\u2019 where \u2018nashi\u2019 are the forces of benevolence, while \u2018chujie\u2019 are the forces of ultimate corruption, chaos and evil. In sum, the word is not \u2018innocent,\u2019 as it was and is skillfully used in multiple contexts against multiple targets,\u201d Avramov said.\n\nIt is akin, in a way, to the loyalty often engendered in sports fans who love all associated with their team, and see anybody associated with the other side to be enemies.\n\nAs shown on the graphs, from March 2016 to January 2019, posts containing Nash and Nasha have been on the decline in the last two years, but engagement actions, reactions have started to increase in January 2019.\n\nIn Russia such possessive pronouns are \u201cthe tools for manipulation of the public opinion, as well a key characteristic of a politician, reflecting his worldview and ideology,\u201d Dr. of Philology Maria Laskova, at the Russian Southern Federal University, wrote in the study, \u201cPersonal pronouns in the political discourse.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe weaponization of the term is very effective, as once it has become a popular slogan, battle cry and a cognitive signifier, it quickly became popular not only at elite level discourse (i.e. speeches, official documents), but also at mass level,\u201d said Avramov.\n\nThe term \u201cis inclusive enough to embrace anywhere from mass activists to Elon Musk and has proven to be a very potent tool for quick marking and targeting of everything and everyone not deemed \u2018ours\u2019 that is equated with \u2018pure,\u2019 thus casting them as \u2018foreign\u2019 thus \u2018impure,\u201d Avramov said. \u201cLogically, the people and groups belonging to the second category do not qualify to be equal, respectful and welcome in the new Kremlin worldview.\u201d\n\n\u200bNote: Elon Musk holds citizenship to three countries, none of them Russia. He grew up in South Africa, obtained Canadian citizenship after emigrating there for college and later moved to the U.S.", "lang": "en"}
