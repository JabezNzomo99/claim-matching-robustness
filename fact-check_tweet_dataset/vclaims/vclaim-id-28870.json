The post claims that the man seen in the video is a worker of Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claims made in the post.\n\nWhen one goes through the comments section of the video posted, in one of the comments, it is mentioned by a user that the video is actually from China.\n\nOn searching in YouTube with keywords \u201cMetro dance China\u201d, the similar video posted on Facebook was found to be uploaded by the Hong Kong based \u2018South China Morning Post\u2019. The video carries the description as: \u201cA construction worker in southwestern China\u2019s Sichuan province learned how to dance, and posting his smooth moves online has made him a star\u201d. The same video was posted by multiple Chinese users on Twitter as well as YouTube way back in February 2019.\n\nThe video gained momentum on social media platforms after it was tweeted by the MD of Hyderabad metro. Among others, it was retweeted by TRS Leader KTR. He later deleted his tweet because it was not from Hyderabad. But some media channels took it up and shared it as Hyderabad metro worker dance.\n\nTo sum it up, this dance video is not that of a worker in Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited. It is that of a construction worker in South-Western China\u2019s Sichuan province.\n\nDid you watch our Facebook live on Fake News (Misinformation)", "lang": "en"}
