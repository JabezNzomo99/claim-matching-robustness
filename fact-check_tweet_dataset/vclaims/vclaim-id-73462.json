It's a step that would \u2014 if taken in isolation \u2014 remove nearly 90% of funding for Social Security benefits, and thus likely pose a threat to the continued existence of those programs.\n\nIn the summer of 2020, less than three months before that year\u2019s U.S. presidential election, several readers asked Snopes to examine the accuracy of reports that President Donald Trump had vowed to \u201cterminate\u201d Social Security.\n\nOn Aug. 8, 2020, the non-profit group Social Security Works published a news release with the headline \u201cDonald Trump: If Re-Elected, I Will \u2018Terminate\u2019 Social Security.\u201d In the press release, the group\u2019s president Nancy Altman wrote:\n\nDonald Trump once promised that he would be \u2018the only Republican that doesn\u2019t want to cut Social Security.\u2019 We now know that what he meant is that cutting Social Security doesn\u2019t go far enough for him: He wants to destroy Social Security. Donald Trump\u2019s executive order, which seeks to defer Social Security contributions, is bad enough. But his promise to \u2018terminate\u2019 FICA contributions if he is reelected is a full-on declaration of war against current and future Social Security beneficiaries. Social Security is the foundation of everyone\u2019s retirement security. At a time when pensions are vanishing and 401ks have proven inadequate, Trump\u2019s plan to eliminate Social Security\u2019s revenue stream would destroy the one source of retirement income that people can count on. Moreover, Social Security is often the only disability insurance and life insurance that working families have. If reelected, Trump plans to destroy those benefits as well.\n\nOn the same day, left-leaning website Common Dreams posted an article whose headline read, \u201cDonald Trump Just Admitted on Live Television He Will \u2018Terminate\u2019 Social Security and Medicare if Reelected in November.\u201d The Common Dreams article stated that \u201cPresident Donald Trump openly vowed to permanently \u2018terminate\u2019 the funding mechanism for both Social Security and Medicare if reelected in November \u2026 Announcing and then signing a series of legally dubious executive orders \u2026 Trump touted his order for a payroll tax \u2018holiday\u2019 \u2014 which experts noted would later have to be paid back \u2014 but said if he won in November that such a cut would become permanent.\u201d\n\nTrump did not explicitly vow to terminate Social Security, as those headlines claimed, but one of several plans he mentioned in an Aug. 8 press conference involved eliminating payroll taxes \u2014 a move that would, as things stand, remove the overwhelming majority of funding for Social Security and likely pose a threat to its continued existence.\n\nOn Aug. 8, the White House published a raft of executive orders and memoranda, including one on \u201cDeferring Payroll Tax Obligations in Light of the Ongoing COVID-19 Disaster.\u201d That memo read, in part:\n\nThe Secretary of the Treasury is hereby directed to use his authority pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 7508A to defer the withholding, deposit, and payment of the tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. 3101(a), and so much of the tax imposed by 26 U.S.C. 3201 as is attributable to the rate in effect under 26 U.S.C. 3101(a), on wages or compensation, as applicable, paid during the period of September 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020, subject to the following conditions: (a) The deferral shall be made available with respect to any employee the amount of whose wages or compensation, as applicable, payable during any bi-weekly pay period generally is less than $4,000, calculated on a pre-tax basis, or the equivalent amount with respect to other pay periods \u2026\n\nIn other words, employees who earned less than the equivalent of $100,000 per year \u2014 before taxes \u2014 would have their payroll taxes deferred from September until the end of the year. (This means they would not pay payroll taxes for four months, but would be expected to pay them at a later date).\n\nPayroll taxes comprise Social Security and Medicare taxes. For Social Security, an employer and employee each pay the equivalent of 6.2% of the employee\u2019s wages (12.4% in total), while for Medicare, the employer and employee each pay 1.45% (2.9% in total). Self-employed workers pay all 12.4% for Social Security and 2.9% for Medicare themselves.\n\nOn Aug. 8, Trump announced his executive actions at a press conference held at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. During the course of his remarks, Trump referred to the payroll tax deferral, saying, \u201cIn a few moments, I will sign a directive instructing the Treasury Department to allow employers to defer payment of the employee portion of certain payroll taxes from September 1.\u201d\n\nHowever, the president made additional remarks that were not contained in the memorandum itself, indicating that he intended to extend that deferral beyond Dec. 31, 2020; to waive any later obligation on employees to pay the deferred contributions; and even that he planned to eliminate payroll taxes entirely. The following is an edited transcript of the relevant section of his remarks. (A full transcript of his press conference is available here, and his remarks can be viewed in full below.)\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m victorious on November 3rd, I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax. So I\u2019m going to make them all permanent \u2026 If I win, I may extend and terminate. In other words, I\u2019ll extend it beyond the end of the year and terminate the tax. And so, we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\n\n\n Trump articulated several intentions in that section of his speech.\n\nFirst, he said he planned to \u201cforgive\u201d the payroll taxes in question, meaning that rather than simply being delayed, the obligation to pay those four months\u2019 worth of Social Security and Medicare taxes would be removed entirely. Second, he said he planned to \u201cmake permanent cuts to the payroll tax,\u201d suggesting that the rate at which Social Security and Medicare contributions are withheld would be reduced from 6.2 % and 1.45 %, respectively. Third, Trump said he would \u201cextend\u201d the payroll tax deferral beyond Dec. 31. Finally, Trump said he would \u201cterminate the tax.\u201d\n\nAn important difference exists between extending the deferral of payroll tax obligations and forgiving deferred obligations \u2014 just as a very significant difference exists between cutting payroll taxes and terminating them entirely.\n\nAlthough Trump articulated several plans for payroll taxes, it remains the case that he did at one point say he would \u201cterminate the tax.\u201d Doing so would remove the overwhelming majority of funding for the two benefits that comprise Social Security: Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI), and Disability Insurance (DI), known collectively as OASDI. According to the federal Social Security Administration, fully 89% of OASDI came from payroll taxes in 2019.\n\nIt is reasonable to suppose that removing so much funding for Social Security, without replacing it, would pose a threat to the continued existence of Social Security itself and its associated OASDI benefits. In his Aug. 8 remarks, Trump made no reference to a plan for replacing the funding that would be lost if he carried out his stated intention to terminate payroll taxes, nor has he done so anywhere else. (Snopes asked the White House and the Trump campaign to provide details on how the president intends to cover the shortfall in Social Security funding, but we did not receive a substantive response from either.)\n\nSince Trump has publicly articulated an intention to eliminate payroll taxes, and he has not accompanied that with any proposal to replace the taxes as a source of Social Security funding, it is reasonable to argue that, as Social Security Works and Common Dreams did, Trump\u2019s payroll tax proposals, as they stand, could effectively spell the end of Social Security.\n\nHowever, it should not be ignored that, in the same Aug. 8 speech, Trump also articulated several other plans in relation to payroll taxes, and that at least one of those plans was mutually incompatible with \u201cterminating the tax,\u201d since Trump could not initiate \u201cpermanent cuts\u201d to payroll taxes if those taxes no longer existed. As a result, we are issuing a rating of \u201cMixture\u201d for this claim.", "lang": "en"}
