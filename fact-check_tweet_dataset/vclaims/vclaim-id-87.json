The unit resided under the National Security Council (NSC) \u2014 a forum of White House personnel that advises the president on national security and foreign policy matters.\n\nIn May 2018, the team was disbanded and its head Timothy Ziemer, top White House official in the NSC for leading U.S. response against a pandemic, left the Trump administration, the Washington Post reported ( here ). Some members of the global health and security team were merged into other units within the NSC, the article said.\n\nThe reorganization followed John Bolton\u2019s appointment as national security advisor, and the departure of Tom Bossert, the homeland security advisor who the Post wrote \u201chad called for a comprehensive biodefense strategy against pandemics and biological attacks.\u201d\n\nCONFLICTING OPINIONS ON WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TEAM\n\nIn an op-ed for the Washington Post, Beth Cameron, former Senior Director for Global Health Security and Biodefense in the NSC, wrote, \u201cWhen President Trump took office in 2017, the White House\u2019s National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense survived the transition intact.\n\n\u201cIts mission was the same as when I was asked to lead the office, established after the Ebola epidemic of 2014: to do everything possible within the vast powers and resources of the U.S. government to prepare for the next disease outbreak and prevent it from becoming an epidemic or pandemic. One year later, I was mystified when the White House dissolved the office, leaving the country less prepared for pandemics like covid-19\u201d ( here ).\n\nThree days later, Tim Morrison, former senior director for counterproliferation and biodefense on the NSC, wrote in another Washington Post Op-Ed, \u201cIt is true that the Trump administration has seen fit to shrink the NSC staff. But the bloat that occurred under the previous administration clearly needed a correction. \u2026 One such move at the NSC was to create the counterproliferation and biodefense directorate, which was the result of consolidating three directorates into one, given the obvious overlap between arms control and nonproliferation, weapons of mass destruction terrorism, and global health and biodefense. It is this reorganization that critics have misconstrued or intentionally misrepresented. If anything, the combined directorate was stronger because related expertise could be commingled\u201d ( here ).\n\nOn March 14, 2020, John Bolton described the changes made to the team as streamlining. He tweeted: \u201cClaims that streamlining NSC structures impaired our nation's bio defense are false. Global health remained a top NSC priority, and its expert team was critical to effectively handling the 2018-19 Africa Ebola crisis. The angry Left just can't stop attacking, even in a crisis.\u201d ( here )\n\nOn March 19, 2020, former Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden \u200bcalled the changes elimination. He tweeted: \u201cThe Obama-Biden Administration set up the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense to prepare for future pandemics like COVID-19. Donald Trump eliminated it \u2014 and now we're paying the price.\u201d ( here )\n\nThere is disagreement over how to describe the changes at the NSC\u2019s Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense in 2018. The departure of some members due to \u201cstreamlining\u201d efforts under John Bolton is documented. The \u201cpandemic response team\u201d as a unit was largely disbanded.\n\nPartly false: The Trump administration disbanded the \u201cpandemic response\u201d team, but some of the team members were reassigned to roles that included pandemic response\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
