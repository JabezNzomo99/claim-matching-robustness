He said we have got to play, even if nobody comes, nobody shows up, we have got to play.\u201d\n\nMemories are fallible, even for presidents. This is why they are supposed to have staffs who help make sure they stick to the facts and, if they get it wrong, make sure that the misstatements are corrected.\n\nPresident Trump is not an ordinary president, and apparently he does not have a typical staff. So, in an effort to justify holding a campaign rally after 11 people at a synagogue were gunned down in Pittsburgh, the president twice referenced an event that did not happen.\n\nThe attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, struck at the heart of New York\u2019s financial district, destroying the twin towers of the World Trade Center. Is it possible that the New York Stock Exchange, located just blocks away, quickly reopened the next day?\n\nThe NYSE and even the over-the-counter Nasdaq exchange never opened for trading the morning of the attacks and were closed until Sept. 17 \u2014 the longest shutdown since 1933. Other stock markets around the world were closed as well. It\u2019s easy to figure this out using Google. There\u2019s even a whole Wikipedia page.\n\n\u201cThe reopening had both financial and psychological significance for the country,\u201d the WSJ said. \u201cIn fact, it was Wall Street\u2019s proudest day. The 9/11 attacks in New York were just blocks from the New York Stock Exchange, and getting the markets to reopen was a round-the-clock effort, even as workers grieved for those who died. The market closure itself was the longest in nearly 70 years, and it was certain that there would be heavy trading and a stock drop when trading resumed.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump appeared to remember \u201cDick Russell, a friend of mine, great guy,\u201d as reopening the exchange, it was actually Dick Grasso, at the time chief executive of the NYSE. Grasso appeared on Fox News just a few weeks ago, on Sept. 11, to recall the reopening. Dick Russell was a senator from Georgia, known as a fierce defender of segregation. (Update: When we listened to the video the night of the speech, it sounded like \u201cRussell,\u201d which was also how it was rendered in the transcript. But some readers said it sounded like \u201cGrasso\u201d to them. Listening to it again, that\u2019s possible but it\u2019s hard to tell with crowd noise. But it certainly makes more sense for Trump to have said Grasso. We have updated the transcript to say Grasso.)\n\nTrump also implied that baseball did not pause for the attacks but started playing games as soon as possible. But the games were canceled that night \u2014 and then for the rest of the week. Professional baseball also did not start up again until six days later, on Sept. 17. The whole baseball season was pushed back a week.\n\nThere are many reasons the president might have wanted to have continued with a campaign rally. But conjuring up a phony story about the stock exchanges and baseball after the Sept. 11 attacks is not a valid one. We can possibly understand one mistake, but not that it was repeated hours later. Is there no one on his staff who will dare tell him that his memory is faulty?", "lang": "en"}
