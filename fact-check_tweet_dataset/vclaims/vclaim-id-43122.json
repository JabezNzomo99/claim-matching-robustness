The claim is misleading; Thai doctors say the cocktail of drugs did greatly improve the condition of the patient over 48 hours but did not cure them of the viral infection; the World Health Organisation (WHO) said there is \u201cno specific medicine\u201d to prevent or treat novel coronavirus as of February 14, 2020.\n\nThis Facebook post was published on February 11, 2020. It has been shared 282 times.\n\nIt shows a photo of two people wearing gowns in a laboratory with the text: \u201cThailand \u2018cures\u2019 coronavirus with an anti-HIV drug in 48 hours. The doctors combined the anti-flu drug oseltamivir with lopinavir and ritonavir, antivirals used to treat HIV.\u201d\n\nBelow is the screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe novel coronavirus has killed nearly 1,800 people and infected more than 70,000 others in China after it was discovered in Wuhan in late 2019, AFP reported here on February 17, 2020.\n\nA similar claim was published here, here and here on Twitter; here on a Ghanaian website and here on a Ugandan news site.\n\nThe claim is misleading; Thai doctors said that whilst they successfully treated one coronavirus patient with a cocktail of drugs, they did not \u201ccure\u201d her of the viral infection.\n\nOn February 2, 2020, Thailand\u2019s Ministry of Public Health announced that a Chinese national infected with novel coronavirus has shown \u201cdramatic improvement\u201d some 48 hours after being treated with a cocktail of the anti-flu drug oseltamivir and anti-HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir. Here is an AFP report on the press briefing.\n\n\u201cI have experience treating patients with severe conditions. I treated the patients and the result was satisfying. The patient got better fast within 48 hours,\" Dr. Kriengsak Attipornwanich said during the briefing.\n\n\u201cTen days before arriving in my hospital, the patient\u2019s condition was worsening and the inflammatory marker was becoming higher and higher every day. The patient had a tendency to need a respirator. But when she was given the cocktail drugs, the patient got better significantly. Her fever reduced, the patient had a better appetite.\u201d\n\nThe Ministry of Public Health also published this article titled \u201cAnutin reveals good news. Thai doctors treat patients with COVID-2019. Symptoms improved in 48 hours after treatment.\u201d\n\nAnutin Charnvirakul is Thailand\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Public Health.\n\nThe article reads, in part: \u201cThe Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Public Health reveals that doctors from Rajavithi hospital treated a patient with inflammatory lungs, infected with novel coronavirus 2019, showing severe symptoms, got better in 48 hours.\u201d\n\nAs of February 14, the WHO\u2019s guidelines state there is \u201cno specific medicine\u201d to prevent or treat novel coronavirus.\n\nThe guidelines states, in part: \u201cTo date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the novel coronavirus. However, those infected should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to coordinate efforts to develop medicines to treat nCoV with a range of partners.\u201d\n\nThe US-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also states here that \u201cthere is no specific antiviral treatment recommended\u201d for the COVID-2019 infection.\n\n\u201cPeople infected with [COVID-2019] should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms,\u201d the agency said.", "lang": "en"}
