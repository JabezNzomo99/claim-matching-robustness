Is \"ba...\" short for bad? Bastards? Something else?\n\nRegardless, this is an example of \"article spinning,\" in which writers or websites republish existing material - often verbatim - to create the impression that it is new content.\n\nIn 2016, while promoting the movie \"Suicide Squad,\" Smith gave an interview to news.com.au, an Australian news and entertainment site. The story published several quotes about Smith's views on U.S. President Donald Trump, including his anger over Trump's comments about women.\n\nThe article was published on August 3, 2016, a little more than three months before Trump was elected president.\n\nEver since, various websites have pulled quotes from the article to give the impression the actor just made the comments. The new stories lack the context and framing of the original article.\n\nThe headline is also false. There is no known record of Smith having said, \"I'm not afraid to say that Trump and his supporters....\" The closest quote bearing any similarity is an oft-quoted saying from Smith to describe his work ethic:\n\nThe headline quote is never referenced again in the article, so it is unclear exactly what the authors are trying to claim he said.\n\nWe wrote about magnanewspapers.com before.
