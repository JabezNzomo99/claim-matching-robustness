Just last November, Missouri voters rejected Proposition D, which would have increased the state\u2019s gas tax by 10 cents and used the funds to boost spending on roads and bridges.\n\nIn his Aug. 29 newsletter, U.S. Rep. Sam Graves, R-Mo., announced that MoDOT will receive a $20.7 million federal grant for the state\u2019s bridge replacement program. To highlight the significance of the challenges, Graves said, \"The average bridge in Missouri is 48 years old\u2014most were only designed to last for 50 years.\"\n\nThe problem sounds severe and a little dangerous, so we decided to see if the numbers hold up. To a degree, they do \u2014 Graves took the sentence from the MoDOT website.\n\nMoDOT\u2019s website confirms that the average age of Missouri bridges is 48 years old. An average takes into account all bridges from newly built ones to those much older than 48 years.\n\nState bridge engineer Dennis Heckman pointed out a lack of records before about 1900. About 40 bridges were built before 1909; they are at least 110 years old and might be even older.\n\nHeckman explained that design life doesn\u2019t mean a bridge closes or becomes unsafe on its 50th birthday. Intended design life is not a set expiration date. In reality, it\u2019s more like a sell-by date that indicates when a bridge\u2019s quality needs to be monitored more closely. Says his amendment on a budget bill \u201cwould have helped get kids back in school after teachers were vaccinated. Every single Senate Democrat voted against it.\u201d\n\n\"When they reach that age, you\u2019re going to be maintaining them a lot more, fixing them a lot more,\" Heckman said. \"They just become a lot more high maintenance.\"\n\nThere\u2019s also some variation in the design life of Missouri\u2019s bridges to take into account. For decades, Heckman said, a 50-year design life was standard, and about 8,000 of MoDOT\u2019s 10,400 bridges have a design life of 50 years. In the past 10 to 15 years, designing bridges with a 75-year life span has become more common; about 2,350 bridges were built to this standard. And longer, river-crossing bridges are built with a design life of 100 years. About 50 bridges currently fall into this 100-year design life category.\n\nIn total, 6,000, or 60%, of Missouri\u2019s bridges are past their intended design life, and Heckman said MoDOT\u2019s ability to extend the lifespan of these bridges is unique to each bridge and its specific conditions.\n\nFederal law requires all publicly owned highway bridges over 20 feet long to be inspected about once every two years, and currently, 909 of the bridges MoDOT inspects are rated \"poor\" by federal National Bridge Inspection Standards. Poor is the worst rating a bridge can receive and remain open for use.\n\nPoor bridges result in weight limits that hinder economic development and reduce Missourians\u2019 safety, Heckman said. \"Heavier trucks can\u2019t use them. Farmers can\u2019t use them when they\u2019re hauling their grain or hogs to market. So you end up with a lot of detours.\" He also said many bridges cannot support the weight of a school bus, firetruck, or ambulance.\n\nThis statement comes directly from MoDOT\u2019s data on state bridges, but it needs a bit of clarification. Most bridges don\u2019t need to be replaced when they turn 50. That\u2019s when engineers could expect them to need more maintenance. Condition, not design life, determines the death of a bridge.
