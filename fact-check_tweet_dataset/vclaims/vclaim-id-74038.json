Rather, when you consider the context of her remark, she was actually taking a sympathetic view of young people and illustrating a larger point about how the criminal justice system treats young adults in that age range when they are developmentally prone to making \"really bad decisions.\"\n\nIn early August 2020, Snopes readers asked about social media posts stating that U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., had referred to 18- to 24-year-old \u201cpotential voters\u201d as \u201cstupid.\u201d Here\u2019s a screen shot of one such post, which was widely seen on Facebook:\n\n\n\n Harris was selected on Aug. 11, 2020, to run alongside the Democratic party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden. She is viewed favorably among various voter demographics, including young voters.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Harris made a remark calling people in the 18-24 age range \u201cstupid\u201d during a speech in 2014, when she was attorney general of California.\n\nBut she wasn\u2019t directly talking about \u201cvoters.\u201d The missing context from this claim is that as Harris recounted various efforts to reduce incarceration and recidivism among young adults, she wryly commented on the decision-making tendencies of those newly entering adulthood.\n\nThe comment came as she was describing Back on Track, a program she launched in 2005 when she was district attorney of San Francisco. The program allowed young people facing first-time, low-level drug sale charges to have their cases dismissed if they met intensive educational and career achievement goals. Here is the quote with more context included:\n\nSo we designed this program around the 18 through 24 [age range] mostly but it was usually up to 30 [years old]. First time, low-level drug sales offender\u2026 And here\u2019s what we did. We recognized the fact that 18 through 24 \u2014 when I was at Howard University and we were in college, we were 18 through 24, and you know what we were called? College kids. But when you turn 18 and you\u2019re in the system, you are considered an adult, period. Without any regard to the fact that, that is the very phase of life in which we have invested billions of dollars in colleges and universities knowing that, that is the prime phase of life during which we mold and shape and direct someone to become a productive adult. What\u2019s the other thing we know about this population? And it\u2019s a specific phase of life, remember, age is more than a chronological fact. What else do we know about this population of 18 through 24? They are stupid. [Crowd laughs.] That is why we put them in dormitories, and they have a resident assistant. They make really bad decisions. So we focused on that age population.\n\nHarris did refer to 18- to 24-year-olds as \u201cstupid\u201d during a speech in 2014. However, she wasn\u2019t talking about voters in that age range so much as she was talking about a developmental stage of life for all young adults. And she seems to have used the tongue-in-cheek jab to illustrate a broader need for empathy when it comes to how bad decisions can lead some young people to be prosecuted as adults at a time in their lives when what they need instead is guidance.\n\nThe speech can be viewed here:", "lang": "en"}
