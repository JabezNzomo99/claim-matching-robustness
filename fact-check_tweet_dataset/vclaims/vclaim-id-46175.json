This is false; experts told AFP that 5G is based on radio frequency and that this does not create viruses.\n\nIn one of the most widespread claims, popular American singer Keri Hilson asserted that coronavirus is caused by fifth-generation wireless technology, known as 5G. In a series of now-deleted tweets on March 16, 2020 (archived here), Hilson claimed COVID-19 was not as widespread in Africa because of the absence of 5G.\n\n\u201cPeople have been trying to warn us about 5G for YEARS. Petitions, organizations, studies\u2026what we\u2019re going through is the effects of radiation. 5G launched in CHINA. Nov 1, 2019. People dropped dead,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTurn off 5G by disabling LTE!!! Why do you think the virus is not happening in Africa like that? Not a 5G region. There may be a few bases there, but not as prevalent as other countries. It has nothing to do with melanin.\u201d\n\nHilson shared a viral YouTube video in which controversial American doctor Thomas Cowan, who remains on probation imposed by the Medical Board of California, argued that the novel coronavirus was created by 5G networks.\n\nIn his video, Cowan claimed that Wuhan, the city where the novel coronavirus outbreak began, was the first city wholly covered by 5G in the world. Cowan and others who believe his theory claim that China launched 5G in October 2019 \u2014 two months before the outbreak started.\n\nSome of these claims about 5G causing novel coronavirus have been made in Facebook posts shared thousands of times, including a photograph of a poster accusing 5G network towers of being \u201cthe real cause for the virus deaths\u201d.\n\nThe posts also claim that \u201cthe vaccine\u201d contains a chip to give personal information to authorities. However, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is not yet a vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19.\n\nExperts differ on which country leads in the commercial use of 5G, but agree that the top nations are China, South Korea (the first to launch in 2019), the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nIn late October 2019, China rolled out the commercial use of 5G in 50 cities.\n\nNot only did the novel coronavirus not get its start in pioneering South Korea, but the virus has gained a foothold in many countries (for example, Malaysia, Iran, France, Singapore and Nigeria) without 5G networks.\n\n\n\n5G does not cause viruses\n\nWhile there have been health concerns regarding the use of 5G networks \u2014 and mobile networks in general \u2014 owing to radiation, this has nothing to do with the outbreak of viruses, experts told AFP.\n\nSpeaking to Keri Hilson\u2019s claims, Yusuf Sambo, a researcher at the University of Glasgow who is testing 5G in Scotland, said: \u201cI think she\u2019s an amazing singer, but I am not sure she knows what she\u2019s talking about. Yes, there are fears about the health implications of 5G but they have to do with cancer and not viral infections.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of her tweets actually advised people to \u2018turn off 5G by disabling LTE\u2019. She is literally saying \u2018turn off 5G by disabling 4G\u2019,\u201d said Sambo.\n\nFabien Heliot, a researcher who specialises in electromagnetic exposure in wireless communication at the University of Surrey, explained: \u201c5G, like previous generations of cellular communication systems, is a RF-based (radiofrequency) technology that uses electromagnetic (EM) waveform to transmit information; EM-waveforms are themselves non-ionizing radiations.\u201d\n\nHeliot said the waveforms in 5G are designed and transmitted similarly to 4G. \u201cThe main and only difference so far is ... that 5G can transmit more data by using larger frequency bandwidth at higher carrier frequency, and directivity of antennas at the base station.\u201d\n\nBeing a living thing, a virus cannot be created by radiation, added Heliot. \u201cActually it is the other way round \u2014 there are guidelines put in place to ensure that radiation does not harm living things.\u201d\n\nHeliot said that \u201cthe possible side-effects of 5G are the same as 4G, 3G, 2G, Wi-Fi; all these wireless communication technologies use EM waveform that radiates energy\u201d.\n\nHe said 5G radiations are not as severe as \u201cCT scan or x-ray technologies\u201d which are used in medical care.\n\nThe World Health Organization's website states that \u201ca large number of studies have been performed over the last two decades to assess whether mobile phones pose a potential health risk. To date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use\u201d.\n\nRegarding 5G, the WHO states: \u201cHealth-related conclusions are drawn from studies performed across the entire radio spectrum but, so far, only a few studies have been carried out at the frequencies to be used by 5G.\n\n\u201cTissue heating is the main mechanism of interaction between radiofrequency fields and the human body. Radiofrequency exposure levels from current technologies result in negligible temperature rise in the human body.\n\n\u201cAs the frequency increases, there is less penetration into the body tissues and absorption of the energy becomes more confined to the surface of the body (skin and eye). Provided that the overall exposure remains below international guidelines, no consequences for public health are anticipated.\u201d\n\nSome countries are remaining cautious: In late January, France's Agency for Health and Safety highlighted a need for more data before 5G could be rolled out in the country.", "lang": "en"}
