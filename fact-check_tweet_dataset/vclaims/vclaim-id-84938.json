When asked during a Republican primary debate in Miami why voters should trust that Trump \u201cwill run the country differently from how you run your businesses,\u201d he answered: \u201cBecause nobody knows the system better than me. \u2026 I\u2019m a businessman. These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We\u2019re allowed to do it. \u2026 I\u2019m the one that knows how to change it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that doesn\u2019t make it any easier for people whose jobs have been outsourced overseas, but if a company\u2019s only means of survival is by farming jobs outside its walls, then sometimes it\u2019s a necessary step. The other option might be to close its doors for good,\u201d Trump wrote in the post.\n\nWe searched for sources of Trump products through publicly available data, including online retail stores and public data of shipments at U.S. ports from 2007 through Aug. 17, 2016, gathered by the private company ImportGenius.com. The data shows the last port of shipment before entering the United States (meaning Mexico is not included) and specifies the manufactured location for certain items. (Thanks to Kim Soffen, graphics reporter at The Washington Post, who worked with us to analyze the imports database. Check out her analysis of a decade of Trump\u2019s imports.)\n\nSome of the Trump suits on Amazon.com show they were imported, Made in USA or both. BuzzFeed ordered a suit that was listed as both \u201cimported\u201d and \u201cMade in USA\u201d \u2014 and ended up with a label showing the suits were made in Indonesia.\n\nManufacturing information online is not always reliable \u2014 for example, a photo of one shirt shows a \u201cMade in Bangladesh\u201d label, but the item description says it was made in China. This may be a reflection of the different countries that products sometimes pass through before they are ultimately shipped into the United States.\n\nTrump Vodka was manufactured at a distillery in the Netherlands, supposedly distilled five times from \u201cEuropean wheat,\u201d but the distribution company stopped carrying it in 2010. An Israeli company continued to carry Trump Vodka, although the version sold in Israel is different from the original Trump Vodka. The Trump Vodka produced and sold in Israel is made from ingredients that make it kosher for Passover, which made it a popular beverage around the holidays. But the Jerusalem Post reported that it turned out that not all ingredients actually were kosher for Passover.\n\nThe Clinton ad claims that \u201cTrump\u2019s products have been made in 12 other countries.\u201d This is correct. We know of at least 12 countries where Trump products were manufactured (China, the Netherlands, Mexico, India, Turkey, Slovenia, Honduras, Germany, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Vietnam and South Korea). Further, Trump products transited other countries through the packaging and shipping process \u2014 meaning workers in more than 12 countries contributed to getting many of Trump\u2019s products made, packaged and delivered to the United States.\n\nAs our inventory shows, manufacturing is a global process. Components of a product of an American company are made in different parts of the world, depending on who offers the most competitive prices, and ultimately imported into the country to be sold to American consumers. It\u2019s not as simple as deciding not to eat an Oreo because Nabisco found a cheaper place to employ some of its workers.\n\nTrump\u2019s practice as a businessman is not consistent with his current rhetoric against trade as a presidential nominee \u2014 this vulnerability is backed with more than enough factual evidence. If Trump brand customers took the same stance against his products as he did against Nabisco, it is clear they would be left with few Trump items to buy. However, we do know of at least four Trump products made in the United States: \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats, bedding, water and cologne.", "lang": "en"}
