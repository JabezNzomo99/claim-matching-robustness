You are on your own,\" or words to that effect.\n\nBest did not utter or write the words falsely attributed to her as a direct quotation. Her statements, in the July 24 letter, were much more narrowly focused and specific than, \"We cannot enforce the law,\" and her letter directly contradicted claims that she had, in effect, told Seattle residents, \"You are on your own.\"\n\nOn July 24, Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best wrote to residents that a city ordinance prohibiting police from using \"crowd control weapons\" would mean her officers would have \"no ability to safely intercede to preserve property in the midst of a large, violent crowd.\"\n\nIn the summer of 2020, amid nationwide protests over the death of a Black man in police custody, readers asked us to verify claims that Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best had told residents and business owners in that city, \u201cWe cannot enforce the law. You are on your own.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter and in blog posts, those words were presented in quotation marks, indicating that they were a direct quotation from remarks made, or words written, by Best.\n\nSeveral other sources did not place quotation marks around the words, indicating that they constituted a summary of Best\u2019s comments, rather than a direct quotation.\n\nSeattle Police Department (SPD) confirmed for Snopes that the letter was authentic, and said it was posted to the website Nextdoor.com on July 24. The letter did not contain the words, \u201cWe cannot enforce the law. You are on your own.\u201d As such, online posts that placed quotation marks around those words misled readers by presenting them as if they were a direct quotation. Those words were also not a fair or reasonable summary of the statements made in the letter.\n\nThe background to the letter was Ordinance 126102, which was passed by Seattle City Council on June 15, filed by the Seattle City Clerk on June 26, and was scheduled to come into force on July 26. (Best\u2019s letter incorrectly identified the legislation as \u201cCity Council Ordinance 119805\u201d \u2014 it was introduced as Council Bill 119805 but filed as Ordinance 126102).\n\nThat legislation banned the use or possession by any city department, including SPD, of \u201ccrowd control weapons,\u201d defined as: \u201ckinetic impact projectiles, chemical irritants, acoustic weapons, directed energy weapons, water cannons, disorientation devices, ultrasonic cannons, or any other device that is designed to be used on multiple individuals for crowd control and is designed to cause pain or discomfort.\u201d\n\nHence Best\u2019s assertion, in her letter, that \u201cThis ordinance bans Seattle Police officers [from] the use of less lethal tools, including pepper spray that is commonly used to disperse crowds that have turned violent.\u201d Best added: \u201cSimply put, the legislation gives officers NO ability to safely intercede to preserve property in the midst of a large, violent crowd.\u201d\n\nThat is a much more specific and narrowly focused assertion than, \u201cWe cannot enforce the law.\u201d There are many areas of policing and law enforcement that SPD, like countless other local police forces around the country, address on a daily basis. Crowd control is just one such area. While some observers might have been alarmed by Best\u2019s warning to residents that Ordinance 126102 would substantially hamstring her officers\u2019 capacity to police a large, unruly protest, it was a misrepresentation to summarize her warning as, \u201cWe cannot enforce the law.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Best also did not write words to the effect that Seattle residents were \u201con their own.\u201d Her letter began by saying that SPD was \u201ccommitted to addressing life safety incidents and calls for service, and responding to ongoing demonstrations and unrest in the city.\u201d Best did not say that officers would not deal with incidents during protests, but did warn residents that her department would have an \u201cadjusted deployment in response to any demonstrations this weekend \u2026\u201d\n\nBest therefore indicated there were certain, specific kinds of disorder and breaches of the law that she anticipated her officers\u2019 would be limited in combating, but she did not say, or imply, that SPD \u201ccannot enforce the law.\u201d\n\nBest and SPD have consistently opposed the provisions of Ordinance 126102, and on July 25 the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington granted an application by the U.S. Justice Department for a temporary restraining order, which prevented Ordinance 126102 from coming into force that weekend. In a statement published later that day, Best advised Seattle residents that \u201c\u2026 SPD officers will be carrying pepper spray and blast balls today, as would be typical for events that carry potential to include violence \u2026\u201d\n\nIn a separate but related court case, Black Lives Matter activists in and around Seattle have sued the city and the police department for, in brief, allegedly using excessive force and violating the First Amendment rights of those taking part in protests against racial injustice and police brutality in the city, which have taken place throughout the summer.\n\nIn June, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Jones issued a temporary restraining order against the city, prohibiting SPD from \u201cemploying chemical irritants or projectiles of any kind against persons peacefully engaging in protests or demonstrations.\u201d However, the order allowed exceptions in cases where police officers take \u201cnecessary, reasonable, proportional, and targeted action to protect against a specific imminent threat of physical harm to themselves or identifiable others or to respond to specific acts of violence or destruction of property.\u201d The order was later extended and is scheduled to remain in place until Sept. 30.\n\nIn clashes with some protesters on July 25, SPD deployed pepper spray, blast balls, and sponge grenades. Black Lives Matter activists have alleged that those actions amounted to a violation of Jones\u2019 restraining order, and two days later the activists filed a motion alleging contempt of court against the city and its police force, claiming that on July 25, \u201cSPD suddenly and without warning divided the protesters into two groups and began an all-out assault. SPD officers lobbed flash-bang grenades, blast balls filled with pepper spray, and foam tipped bullets into the middle of retreating crowds.\u201d\n\nFor its part, SPD said the protests descended into a \u201criot\u201d at one point, with an explosion causing damage to the East Police Precinct building and 59 officers injured over the course of the day.", "lang": "en"}
