Some individuals are interpreting it as the latter being disrespectful to the former since it seemed like Advani was greeting Modi, while Modi wasn\u2019t greeting him back. The leaders were seen sharing a dias at the release event of Rs 100 commemorative coin in memory of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.\n\nThe replies to the tweet from BBC suggested that the users were perceived the image as the PM being disrepsectful towards the BJP stalwart.\n\nAccording to Getty Images, the image was clicked after the release of a commemorative coin at the Parliament House Annexe on December 24, 2018.\n\nAlt News found a video of the moment when the two leaders were seen greeting each other after the function had ended.\n\nSeeing the video, it is clear that LK Advani and Narendra Modi greeted each other by clasping hands in form of a \u2018Namaste\u2019. If one slows down the video and watches it frame by frame, as seen in the screenshot below, Advani had his hands in front of his chest with fingers folded before Modi turn towards him and greeted him. After both Modi and Advani exchanged greetings, Modi placed his hands behind is back, while Advani folded his fingers and continued to hold his hands in front of his chest, his fingers folded again.\n\nIn yet another video, it can be seen that Advani is clasping his hands in front of his chest even after greeting his guests. It would seem that Advani holding his hands before his chest while interacting with others is his standard mannerism.\n\nThus, the perception that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was disrespectful to senior BJP leader LK Advani at this event was false and based on a still picture which excluded the context.", "lang": "en"}
