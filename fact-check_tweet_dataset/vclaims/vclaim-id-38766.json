Telegraph columnist Allison Pearson has also claimed on Twitter that the virus \u201cdoesn\u2019t infect children\u201d.\n\nAre children immune to the new coronavirus?\n\nChildren are not immune to the virus, and there have been confirmed cases of Covid-19 in children.\n\nThe World Health Organisation\u2019s Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said that relatively few cases are seen in children, but that more research was needed to understand why.\n\nChina, which currently has the largest number of Covid-19 cases, has seen several hundred cases of children under 10 with the disease, including newborns. In general, children have been found to present similar, although generally milder, symptoms than adults. But, as in adults, children with underlying health issues seem to have more severe cases of Covid-19, but the data is extremely limited.", "lang": "en"}
