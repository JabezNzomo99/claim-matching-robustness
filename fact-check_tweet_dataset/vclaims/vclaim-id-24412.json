No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to fool Trump supporters and Republicans into sharing made up stories that are clearly marked as satire when you actually click them. Articles from the site are frequently copied by foreign-run fake news websites. The people liking and sharing these stories are enriching foreign website operators (or a liberal from Maine) via the ad revenue generated with the content which is probably not what they expected or wanted.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by BustaTroll.org on June 22, 2019 titled \"Nancy Pelosi's Church Asks Her To Leave Until She 'Finds God and Gets Help'\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe Archbishop of San Fransisco had to personally call on Nancy Pelosi at her home today to ask her to not come to church anymore. The decision, which was made by the local diocese but approved by Papal Decree from Rome, is a step short of excommunication. \"Until Nancy can get her demons under control and stop drinking, she isn't welcome in the Lord's house. Last week she fell asleep and vomited all over Mrs. Kensington. The week before that she wore a pantsuit with no pants and it wasn't long before that we were having her driven home after a fist fight at the Prayer Breakfast. How does a person even get that drunk at 7 AM? We're praying she gets the help she needs.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe story was published in the category \"Hot Potato, Pelosi Satire with Chile Sauce and Liquid Cheese\" and the current Archbishiop of San Francisco is Salvatore Joseph Cordileone (and not \"Art Tubbols\", which is an anagram for \"Busta Troll\", the nickname of the owner of the site).\n\nThe site is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run byself-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other fact checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction to this he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry extremely visible disclaimers everywhere.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up. This story was no exception, it was stolen by at least three foreign-run websites so far.\n\nHere is a video of Blair explaining how his process works:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes bustatroll.org as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
