As the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants has said previously:\n\n\"it should not be interpreted as the number of individuals whose length of life has been shortened by air pollution, as this would only be true if air pollution were the sole cause of deaths. Rather, it is an estimate of the total mortality effect in the local population\".\n\nIt made that comment in relation to a previous estimate that outdoor air pollution leads to the equivalent of 29,000 deaths annually. Today\u2019s calculations update that figure to include the impact of nitrogen dioxide.\n\nWhat this means is that air pollution could also make a smaller contribution to the deaths of more than 40,000 people. But 40,000 is the best estimate of the equivalent number of deaths it causes\u2014and can be used to compare to, say, the number of people killed in road traffic accidents.\n\nAir pollution can contribute to cancer, asthma, stroke and heart disease, diabetes, obesity and dementia, the report says.\n\nThe report says more research is needed to quantify the impact that indoor air pollution has on people\u2019s health.", "lang": "en"}
