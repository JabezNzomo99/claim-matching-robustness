This article is a fact check of the claims.\n\nHas minimum wage increased by 42%?\n\n The first claim is that \u2018Minimum wage increased by 42%, directly benefiting 55 lakh workers\u2019.\n\nThe annual report (2017-18) of the Ministry of Finance states that \u2018the employment sector in India poses great challenge in terms of its structure which is dominated by informal workers, high levels of under employment, skill shortages and labour markets with rigid labour laws and institutions. In this context, the Government has undertaken the exercise of rationalization of the 38 Labour Acts by clubbing them into 4 labour codes viz Code on Wages, Code on Industrial Relations, Code on Social Security and Code on Occupational Safety, Health and Working conditions\u2019. This is still work in progress as the relevant bill has not been passed by the Parliament.\n\nThe annual report (2017-18) of the Ministry of Labour and Employment states that \u2018by simplifying, amalgamating and rationalizing, the relevant provisions of the minimum wages Act, 1948, the payment of bonus Act, 1965 and the equal remuneration Act, 1976. The draft code on wages bill, 2017 has been introduced in the Lok Sabha in August 2017 and referred to standing committee on labour\u2019.\n\nThe report also states that \u2018the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 was enacted to safeguard the interests of the workers mostly in the unorganised sector. Under the provision of the Act, both the Central Government and State Governments are the appropriate governments to fix, revise, review and enforce the payment of minimum wages to workers in respect of scheduled employments under their respective jurisdictions. There are 45 scheduled employments in the Central Sphere and as many as 1709 in the State Sphere. The enforcement of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 is ensured at two levels. While in the Central Sphere, the enforcement is done through the Inspecting officers of the Chief Labour Commissioner (Central) commonly designated as Central Industrial Relations Machinery (CIRM), the compliance in the State Sphere is ensured through the State Enforcement Machinery\u2019.\n\nA response in Lok Sabha states that \u2018according to the provisions contained in the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, the appropriate Government revises the minimum wages in all the scheduled employments under its jurisdiction at an interval not exceeding five years. Recently, Central Government has revised the basic minimum wages in January 2017 for Agriculture, Construction, Non-Coal Mines, Stone-Mines, Sweeping and Cleaning, Watch & Ward and Loading/ Unloading, after consultation with the Minimum Wages Advisory Board. However, in the Central sphere, wages are revised on half yearly basis effective from 1st April and 1st October every year by addition of Variable Dearness Allowance\u2019. What this essentially means is that the central government can only revise minimum wages for employment under its jurisdiction. It cannot exercise control or revise minimum wages of any employments under the jurisdiction of the respective state government.\n\nThe following table shows the differences between the last revised minimum wages of the UPA and the latest one of the BJP government. The comparison is for the semi-skilled (skilled workers are taken where the category is not existing) in A category places including the variable dearness allowance (VDA).\n\nWhile the central government exercises control over the eight sectors mentioned above, the states are responsible for a lot more. For example, in the state of Telangana , the Government of Telangana have fixed minimum rates of wages in (73) Scheduled employments under Minimum Wages Act, 1948 in which 65 employments (industry related) are covered under part-I and 8 (Agriculture related) Scheduled employments under part-II of the said Act. Presently, the wages have been fixed to each and every category under the above specific employments and as a result wages are fixed covering nearly for 20 to 40 categories of workers in each employment\u2019.\n\nWhile this points to the fact that the claim itself is misleading, in the budget speech of 2019-20, the finance minister stated that \u2018during the last five years, the minimum wages of labourers of the all categories have been increased by 42%, which is the highest ever\u2019.\n\nFinally, it can be said that the minimum wages for sectors under the central sphere have increased by varying amounts where as the claim makes a blanket statement about minimum wages having increased across the board.\n\nOn the other hand, there is no publicly available data on how many people have actually benefitted from this revision in the central sector.\n\nHow many people benefitted from the seventh pay commission?\n\n The second claim is that \u2018Seventh pay commission benefitted 50 lakh employees and 35 lakh pensioners\u2019.\n\nThe report of the Seventh Pay Commission states that \u2018the Government of India has also, from time to time, set up various Pay Commissions for improving the pay structure of its employees so that they can attract better talent to public service. In this 21st century, the global economy has undergone a vast change and it has seriously impacted the living conditions of the salaried class. The economic value of the salaries paid to them earlier has diminished. The economy has become more and more consumer economy. Therefore, to keep the salary structure of the employees viable, it has become necessary to improve the pay structure of their employees so that better, more competent and talented people could be attracted for governance\u2019.\n\nThe annual report (2017-18) of the Ministry of Finance states that \u2018the recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission in respect of Central Government employees, Armed Forces personnel, Members of All India Services, etc. which were submitted to the Government on 19th November, 2015, were accepted by the Government in respect of matters pertaining to pay and pension in July, 2016. The decision of the Government in regard to the recommendations pertaining to pay and pension entailed an additional financial implication of Rs. 84,933 crores in the year 2016-17\u2019.\n\nThe same report goes on to describe that \u2018the decisions of the Government on the recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission benefited over 1 crore Central Government employees, including Armed Forces personnel and Members of All India Services, comprising approximately 53 lakh pensioners including Armed Forces personnel\u2019.\n\nHence the numbers reported by the ministry in their annual report are far higher than the numbers in the claim. However, pay commissions are setup on a regular basis and till date, seven pay commissions have been set up to review and make recommendations on the work and pay structure of the central government employees and the army personnel.\n\nWhat is the government\u2019s contribution to EPF?\n\n The third claim is that \u2018contribution of 12% to EPF for new employees for 3 years by the government in sectors employing large number of people\u2019.\n\nThe annual report (2017-18) of the Ministry of Labour and Employment details that the employees provident fund organization (EPFO) is \u2018reposnsible for administration of the employees provident funds and miscellaneous provisions Act, 1952. The schemes for provident fund, family pension and deposit linked insurance are implemented by the organization for the benefit of workers covered under the scheme. The organization is also responsible for administration of employees\u2019 pension scheme, 1995\u2019.\n\nThe Employees\u2019 Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, after the latest amendment states that \u2018the contribution which shall be paid by the employer to the fund shall be 10% of the basic wages, dearness allowance and retaining allowance, if any, for the time being payable to each of the employees whether employed by him directly or by or through a contractor, and the employee\u2019s contribution shall be equal to the contribution payable by the employer in respect of him and may, if any employee so desires, be an amount exceeding ten percent of his basic wages, dearness allowance and retaining allowance if any, subject to the condition that the employer shall not be under an obligation to pay any contribution over and above his contribution payable under this section\u2019.\n\nThe scheme document of the Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana states that \u2018in the Budget Speech 2016-17, it was stated that in order to incentivize creation of new jobs in the formal sector, Government of India will pay the Employee Pension Scheme contribution of 8.33% for all new employees enrolling in EPFO for the first three years of their employment. This will incentivize the employers to recruit unemployed persons and also to bring into the books the informal employees. In order to channelize this intervention towards the target group of semi-skilled and unskilled workers, the scheme will be applicable to those with salary up to Rs 15,000 per month. I have made a budget provision of Rs 1,000 crore for this scheme\u2019.\n\nThe scheme has been amended in April 2018, where the government will pay the full employer\u2019s contribution (both EPF & EPS).\n\nThis story is part of a larger series on the 4-years of the Modi government.
