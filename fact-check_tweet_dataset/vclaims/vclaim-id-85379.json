This was supposed to be tackled in \u201cphase three\u201d of the administration\u2019s plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, now in doubt because of the failure on Friday to advance the \u201cphase one\u201d bill in the House.\n\nMany experts are skeptical about whether buying health insurance across state lines would actually work \u2014 more on that below \u2014 but we were interested in claims made by administration officials such as Vice President Pence and White House press secretary Sean Spicer that this would be similar to buying life insurance and car insurance.\n\nIn 1945, Congress passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which exempted insurance companies from aspects of federal antitrust law and ensured that individual states remained the primary regulators of insurance. That had been the case since 1868, but a Supreme Court ruling had placed the state role in doubt until Congress reaffirmed it. So insurance companies must be licensed in each state.\n\nThere are obviously big differences among the products. Car insurance is strictly limited to a period of time, and rates depend on the value of vehicle, the use of the vehicle, the driver\u2019s record and so forth. Health insurance, by contrast, is heavily regulated at the federal level (especially after the Affordable Care Act mandated that all plans cover a group of essential benefits). And health insurance companies are required to set up provider networks and negotiate prices.\n\nBut the bottom line is that all insurance products are sold state by state, overseen by state insurance commissioners. You may be able to get Geico car insurance in both Virginia and California, but the products may be different, depending on state regulations. Similarly, you may buy Aetna health insurance policies in each state, but again they are subject to state regulations and obviously have different provider networks.\n\n\u201cInsurance is regulated at the state level in accordance with the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which has been in place for 64 years,\u201d said Lynne McChristian, executive director of Florida State University\u2019s Center for Risk Management Education and Research. \u201cIt is not accurate to say that car insurance and life insurance are regulated across state lines. In fact, it is false.\u201d\n\nShe said that many people may not realize that when they call an insurer that has an out-of-state location, they are talking to someone who is licensed to contract business in the prospective customer\u2019s state of residence. If you move to a different state, you might stick with the same company, but your policy is updated to reflect the laws of the new state \u2014 and your premiums are likely to change.\n\nFor example, one state might require coverage of autism, while another would not. If insurance could be bought across state lines, people seeking autism coverage would flock to the product with coverage. That in turn would make the risk pool unbalanced and force premiums up. Moreover, when people have complaints about insurance coverage today, they can seek redress from a state insurance commissioner. That would be more difficult if someone bought a product from another state.\n\nThe ACA, in section 1333, actually encouraged the formation of such regional compacts after January 2016, although as far as we can tell, no regulatory guidance was issued by the Obama administration. Chris Jennings, a health-care consultant who worked for presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, says the provision \u2014 which allows two or more states to form a regional health-insurance compact \u2014 was inserted by a Republican lawmaker during Senate markups of the ACA. But he believes the Obama administration did not promote the option \u201cbecause it was a low priority and there was no evidence it would make a positive difference addressing the myriad of issues they thought they were dealing with.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
