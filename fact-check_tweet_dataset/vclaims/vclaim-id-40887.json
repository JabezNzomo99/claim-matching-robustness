We were concerned at first \u2014 Trebek, after all, has truly been battling cancer for the last year. But then we noticed this rumor was a little too familiar.\n\nIn January 2020, for instance, we debunked a false rumor claiming that Bob Barker had died and left his fortune to Trump. We\u2019ve also covered similar japes about politician Ross Perot and actor Lee Majors.\n\nThese stories all come from America\u2019s Last Line of Defense (LLOD), a network of \u201csatire\u201d websites that includes URLs such as PotratriotsUnite.com, Tatersgonnatate.com, and ConservativeTears.com. While these sites have all trafficked in LLOD\u2019s trademark brand of conservative trolling, the latter website now seems primarily focused on mad lib-style death hoaxes.\n\nThe formula appears to go something like this: \u201c[Celebrity name] dies and makes [pro-Trump action] after death.\u201d The most common \u201cpro-Trump action\u201d in these hoaxes appears to be the bequeathment of a personal fortune to Trump\u2019s re-election campaign.\n\nWe perused the pages of Conservative Tears and found pro-Trump death hoaxes that unceremoniously killed celebrities such as Bill Murray, Arsenio Hall, Ringo Starr, and Tom Hanks:\n\nThese are not genuine news stories about pro-Trump celebrities passing away and leaving their fortunes to the president\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign. These stories all come from a website that labels itself as satire.\n\nEverything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site\u2019s pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you\u2019re still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nThe website also carries a banner that notes the site is full of \u201cdeath hoaxes for your thoughts and prayers.\u201d\n\nIn short: If you hear a rumor about a celebrity dying and leaving a fortune to Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, it may be a false rumor that originated with the website Conservative Tears.", "lang": "en"}
