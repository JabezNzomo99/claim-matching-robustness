That's an extra 5 million patients that were not budgeted for.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to know exactly how many people born abroad register with a GP, but the latest figures show there are probably around 650,000 sign-ups a year in England and Wales (although this estimate has limitations).\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that these people pay no taxes. Many will be employed and pay income tax and National Insurance, and they will almost certainly pay things like VAT which ultimately contribute to funding for public services.\n\nWhere did the claim come from?\n\nThis claim seems to be based on a 2014 Daily Mail article, which reports the findings of a 2011 paper from health think tank the Nuffield Trust.\n\nThe paper mainly assessed immigrants\u2019 use of secondary care services, like hospital treatment. But as part of that, the paper looked at the number of new registrations with GPs in England between January 2000 and October 2008.\n\nIt found that, in that time there were around 550,000 new registrations at GPs per year by people aged 15 or over, with no other registration history.\n\nIts assumption was that most of these people were immigrants, as most people born in England would have already registered with a GP by the age of 15.\n\nThe researchers noted that \u201cnot all first registrants will be international immigrants\u201d such as those born in England or Wales who didn\u2019t get an NHS number early in life or were mistakenly given second numbers.\n\nThere is more up to date data than this though.\n\nHow many immigrants are registering at GPs?\n\nThere were 6.5 million GP registrations between 2008 and 2018 in England and Wales, where the person\u2019s previous address was recorded as being outside of the UK and it was the first time they were registering for a GP here. So that\u2019s around 650,000 registrations a year. You can read the article we wrote in 2019 about a similar figure here.\n\nBut these records don\u2019t always accurately show whether someone\u2019s previous address was outside the UK.\n\nThe records of these GP registrations have something called a \u201cflag 4\u201d attached. That is intended to mean the person signing up to the GP surgery was previously living overseas.\n\nLast year, NHS Digital told us that until March 2016, \u201cit was possible for a patient to be registered in one area as flag 4 then move to another area and be registered again as a flag 4\u201d, so migrants who moved around may have been double counted. It also told us a UK citizen who left the country for three months, then re-registered at a new GP may also be counted as a flag 4.\n\nImmigrants almost certainly contribute towards NHS costs\n\nThe post claims that these \u201cextra 5 million patients\u201d have \u201cnot put a penny into the pot\u201d.\n\nThis is not correct. There\u2019s no evidence that the people registering for GP services pay no income tax or National Insurance through working in the UK. Like people born in the UK, foreign-born people pay National Insurance and income tax if they are working. Even if they\u2019re not working, they will also pay things like VAT, fuel duty, tobacco duty and other regular taxes which are used to pay for public services like the NHS.", "lang": "en"}
