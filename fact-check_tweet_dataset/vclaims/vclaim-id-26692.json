Media outlets reported that the state government sanctioned Rs 133 crore for the event. Nearly every mainstream news organisation carried similar reports \u2013 NDTV, Newsclick, National Herald, The Times of India, Live Hindustan, The Indian Express, ABP News, Mumbai Mirror, The Wire, The Hindu, The Quint, Jansatta, Outlook and Daily Pioneer, among others. Some of these media outlets like NDTV, Outlook, published IANS feed.\n\nJournalists Rahul Pandita and Sakshi Joshi also tweeted the same.\n\nRight-wing website OpIndiatoo said that an estimated Rs 133 crore was approved for the event.\n\nThe estimated cost of \u2018Deepotsav\u2019 for 2019 is Rs 132.70 lakh or approximately Rs 1.33 crore, not Rs 133 crore. This was first pointed out by NDTV journalist Alok Pandey. The press release stating the budget allocation is available on the UP government website. It was released on October 22, a day before most media reports published an erroneous number.\n\nThe press release states, \u201c\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937 2019 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0906\u092f\u094b\u091c\u0928 \u092a\u0930 \u0932\u0917\u092d\u0917 132.70 \u0932\u093e\u0916 \u0930\u0941\u092a\u092f\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u0935\u094d\u092f\u092f \u0915\u093e \u0905\u0928\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u0948\u0964 \u0907\u0938 \u092e\u0947\u0932\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u0906\u092f\u094b\u091c\u0928 \u092a\u0930 \u0939\u094b\u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u0947 \u0935\u094d\u092f\u092f\u092d\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u093e \u0935\u0939\u0928 \u0936\u093e\u0938\u0928 \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u093e \u0927\u0928\u0930\u093e\u0936\u093f \u0915\u0940 \u0909\u092a\u0932\u092c\u094d\u0927\u0924\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u0906\u0927\u093e\u0930 \u092a\u0930 \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e \u091c\u093e\u090f\u0917\u093e\u0964 (Approximately Rs 132.60 lakh has been estimated toward the expenses of the event. The expenses incurred to organise this fair will be borne by the government based on the availability of funds.)\u201c\n\nAmong the media outlets that had reported the amount correctly were Dainik Jagranand Punjab Kesari.\n\nThe Uttar Pradesh government had, therefore, not sanctioned Rs 133 crore for \u2018Deepotsava\u2019, now declared a \u2018state fair\u2019, but Rs 1.33 crore, based on the \u201cavailability of funds\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
