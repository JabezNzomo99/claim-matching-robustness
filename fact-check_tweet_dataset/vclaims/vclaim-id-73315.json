The claim, however, is misleading; in response to the social media posts, a spokesperson for the bank told AFP on August 12, 2020 it will continue to accept cash and cheque deposits, and that the proposed changes only affect agency banks.\n\nThe post was published here on Facebook on July 31, 2020.\n\nIt features an image that shows part of a letter titled \u201cUpdate to deposit options\u201d. The letter lists changes to \"cash and cheque deposits at Westpac\" which are purportedly effective from July 2020.\n\nThe post reads: \u201cAnd ......Westpac is going cashless / By the end of 2020 Westpac, an Australian bank, will no longer accept cash or cheques deposits to your bank account\u2026 Let that sink in\u201d.\n\nThe same claim was also shared here, here, here, here, here, and here on Facebook. It also appears here, here, here and here on Twitter.\n\nThe claim, however, is misleading.\n\nIn response to the social media posts, a spokesperson for Westpac told AFP: \u201cThere is no change to deposits of physical cash or cheques to Westpac accounts\u201d for ordinary account holders.\"\n\n\u201c[The image in the misleading post] relates to changes to services we provide agency banks (e.g. tier 2 banks without significant branch networks and other financial institutions). The picture posted on social media was cropped in a way that excludes important explanatory information. It appears to be a communication from one of the agency banks to its customers,\u201d the spokesperson said in an email to AFP on August 12, 2020.", "lang": "en"}
