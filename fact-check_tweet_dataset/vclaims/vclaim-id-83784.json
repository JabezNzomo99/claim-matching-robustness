The claim -- which appears to be based on misinformation about refugee assistance in Canada -- is false. Irregular immigrants are not eligible for US federal assistance.\n\n\u201cIllegals can get up to $3,874 a month under Federal Assistance program,\u201d according to a Tweet shared 23,000 times by the presidential \u201cfan account\u201d The Trump Train. Although this claim was retweeted by the US president\u2019s official Twitter account @realDonaldTrump, it is not true.\n\nIrregular immigrants in the United States are not eligible to receive any financial assistance, let alone $3,874 per month, because federal assistance programs require a legal status in the United States.\n\nOne of the larger programs, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which provides low-income families with financial assistance and social services, is only available when the applicant is \u201ca U.S. national, citizen, legal alien, or permanent resident.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the Supplemental Security Income (SSI), for the aged and disabled, or the Earned Income Tax Credit, for low-income workers, require applicants to be qualified aliens or resident aliens, two statuses that presuppose legal registration with the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe number that the false tweet refers to, $3,874 per month in federal assistance, presumably comes from the photo of a 2016 invoice for a family of refugees in Canada which was first posted on Facebook in September 2017.\n\nThe photo is regularly presented in a misleading manner, suggesting that the check\u2019s recipient was a single illegal immigrant in Canada. It is clear that the photo came from Canada, because the page bears the name Resettlement Assistance Program, the Canadian program for refugee assistance. The top right of the page behind also shows the Canadian government\u2019s logo, and the words \u201ccheque\u201d and \u201cdependant\u201d are spelt in Canadian English.\n\nNext, the center top box summarizing the family\u2019s profile shows that there are five members, not one, including at least one under 18, one over 18, and one senior. The first section of the invoice, titled \u201cStart-Up Allowances\u201d, shows a total of $1,960. This number refers to a one-time amount that refugees receive upon arrival in Canada, mostly for furniture and warm clothing. It does not constitute a monthly source of financial support.
