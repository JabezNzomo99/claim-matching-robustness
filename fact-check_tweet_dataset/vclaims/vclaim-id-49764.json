Michael Defensor compared the income tax paid by the two media giants during the House hearing on the renewal of ABS-CBN\u2019s legislative franchise.\n\nThe amount of P1.4 billion is Defensor\u2019s estimated total income tax paid by ABS-CBN for four years only -- from 2016 to 2019. His computation is not far-off; according to the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the total amount is P1.3 billion.\n\nThe partylist representative had this exchange with ABS-CBN Compliance Officer Aldrin Cerrado in one of the hearings:\n\nDefensor: Ang sabi po ninyo 14 billion pero ang total niyo pong binayaran [na income tax] is 1.4 billion for 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 (You said 14 billion, but the total [income tax] you paid is 1.4 billion for 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019).\n\nDefensor: Alam niyo po ang galit ng madami, o di naman galit sabihin na nating ang ipinagtataka ng marami, kasi po \u2018yung GMA-7 2018 lang po ang binayaran niyang taxes is 1.4 billion. Yun pong 2018 ang binayaran niyang taxes is 928 million, income tax po ito ah, income tax. Eh kayo po apat na taon 1.4 billion (You know, the public\u2019s anger or let\u2019s say what\u2019s odd for many is that GMA-7 paid 1.4 billion taxes in 2018 alone. In 2018 it paid 928 million, in income tax. This is income tax. But you, 1.4 billion in a span of four years)...\n\nGMA\u2019s income tax for 2018 is P1.4 billion, according to the 40-page Findings and Recommendations of the House committees\u2019s technical working group on the ABS-CBN franchise renewal bill. It sourced the amount from the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAccording to Bureau of Internal Revenue Assistant Commissioner Manuel V. Mapoy who was present in the hearing, ABS-CBN paid about P15.3 billion from 2016 to 2019 -- with all the various types of taxes accounted for.\n\nThe lower amount of income taxes paid by ABS-CBN compared to GMA through its use of tax incentives has been called a \u201cquestionable and unjust, if not immoral, tax avoidance scheme\u201d by the House. It is one of the reasons the network\u2019s bid for a fresh 25-year franchise was not granted.", "lang": "en"}
