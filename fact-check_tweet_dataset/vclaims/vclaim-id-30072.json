This is false; the Social Security Administration said it did not happen, and the articles are labeled \u201csatire\u201d and \u201cjunk news.\u201d\n\nOne article -- shared here and here -- is headlined \u201cPelosi Diverts $2.4 Billion From Social Security To Cover Impeachment Costs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and I, Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer, are looking at about 2 and a half billion dollars. Hope your boss can give you a raise,\u201d it says.\n\nThe article appears on potatriotsunite.com, which includes an \u201cAbout Us\u201d section that reads: \u201cEverything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined.\u201d\n\nDespite the disclaimer on the website -- which is not clearly visible when the link is shared on Facebook, though the web address is -- reactions of users show that the article has been believed as fact.\n\n\u201cWE ALL NEED TO SIGN A PETITION AND DEMAND SHE PUT THE MONEY BACK IN SOCIAL SECURITY-THIS IS FRAUD AND THEFT OF OUR FUNDS- IT WILL HURT ALL OF US WHO ARE RETIRED. LET US ADDRESS IT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO COULD REVERSE THIS DECISION AND EXPOSE HER THEFT,\u201d one user wrote in a post that included a link to the article.\n\nMost of the comments on the post reflected similar belief in the \u201cinformation,\u201d such as: \u201cHEY YOU UGLY WITCH, THAT IS MY MONEY YOU ARE GIVING AWAY. USE THE MONEY \u2018WE THE PEOPLE\u2019 HAVE WORKED FOR AND YOU HAVE ALREADY STOLEN FROM US TO PACK YOUR WALLET.\u201d\n\nBut one user expressed doubt about the claim, while another said it could be satire.\n\nSocial Security Administration spokeswoman Dorothy Clark told AFP that $2.4 billion was not in fact withdrawn to fund impeachment.\n\n\u201cThe Trust Funds are used for two purposes: Social Security benefit payments and program administrative costs. By law, income to the trust funds must be invested, on a daily basis, in securities guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the Federal government,\u201d Clark said by email.\n\nA second article -- shared here and here -- is headlined \u201cFACT CHECK: Yes, Nancy Pelosi Moved Billions from SSI to Cover Impeachment Costs.\u201d\n\nThe web address of the site that published it -- freedomfictions.com -- is visible when the link is shared, and the text makes clear that the claim is untrue.\n\n\u201cPelosi in no way would be able to pull off such a ridiculous stunt, even if she wanted to, and 2.4 billion dollars was randomly invented to sound large. Although it would be worth it to see that cartoon embarrassment of a President gone,\u201d the article says.\n\nThe website also has the same disclaimer in its \u201cAbout US\u201d section as appears on potatriotsunite.com.\n\nBut again, many comments on posts linking to the \u201cfact check\u201d indicate people believe it is real.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll think it\u2019s funny with all your benefits on the hill and out of congress! I have great news for you\u2019ll ! You will never be able to escape the lawlessness you created ! You will pay back one way or the other!\u201d one user commented.\n\n\u201cImpeach her\u2014get her out she is trouble with a capital T,\u201d wrote another.\n\nThe websites on which the articles appear are part of the \u201cAmerica\u2019s Last Line of Defense\u201d network.\n\nOn Facebook, the \u201cAmerica\u2019s Last Line of Defense\u201d page includes the disclaimer: \u201cNothing on this page is real. It is a collection of the satirical whimsies of liberal trolls masquerading as conservatives. You have been warned.\u201d\n\nThe page says it gives \u201cGood Old Fashioned Liberal Troll Provided Fantasy presented as comedy to the left and a social experiment to the right.\u201d\n\nArticles on the network of websites -- which make outrageous claims written as fact, albeit with clear indications that they are not real -- are shared in droves by people apparently believing they are true amid a hyper-partisan American political environment.\n\nAsked why he thinks people believe and share his articles, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Last Line of Defense\u201d founder and owner Christopher Blair responded: \u201cConfirmation bias.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt goes so much further than just ignoring disclaimers. These people are told that they're sharing satire, and it doesn't matter. We point out the debunks from fact-checkers that go out with every share and they call them \u2018liberal lies,\u2019\u201d he told AFP by email.\n\n\u201cThe truth is no longer important to them. All they care about is holding on to their hate and fear,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe people who share our content don't care about the truth. They share 500 things a day, most of which are hate-filled lies. When they share something of ours, there's a chance at accountability,\u201d Blair said.\n\nBlair is supported by \u201ca group of a couple hundred trolls\u201d who \u201cpatrol the pages,\u201d he said by phone.\n\n\u201cThey make sure that there\u2019s accountability for the people commenting, they go into the shares and tell people who are sharing, you know, you\u2019re sharing satire, this isn\u2019t real.\u201d\n\nTrump was impeached by the House of Representatives on December 18, 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. He is now on trial in the US Senate, where members of his Republican party hold enough seats that he is likely to be acquitted.", "lang": "en"}
