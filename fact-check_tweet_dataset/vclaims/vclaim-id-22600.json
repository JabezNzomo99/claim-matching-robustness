[1]\n\nNegative gearing laws allow property investors making a loss - when costs outweigh rental income - to deduct the loss from their taxable income. [2]\n\nThe Labor Party plans to reform housing affordability and negative gearing if elected, limiting the tax breaks to new investment homes from July 1, 2020. All property investments made before January 1, 2020 would be fully grandfathered. [3]\n\nMr Morrison said Labor's plans would have a significant and negative impact. The prime minister quoted research from SQM stating under Labor rents could rise by 22 per cent in Brisbane. [4]\n\nSQM Research is an investment research house, founded and run by property analyst Louis Christopher, which specialises in providing research and data to financial institutions and investors. [5]\n\nThe report states Australian housing is worth approximately $6.8 trillion. \u201cIt is a significant component of the Australian economy, its wealth and its social fabric,\u201d the report said. [6]\n\nUnder Labor\u2019s negative-gearing policy the report found rents changes are initially \u201clikely to be negligible due in part to a current oversupply in Sydney and some other cities\u201d.\n\nHowever, there may be an acceleration from 2021 due to an expected sharp fall in dwelling completions. Under Labor rents could rise between seven to 12 per cent across capital cities from 2020-2022 on average, assuming there was an interest rate cut of half a per cent. \u201cBrisbane and Perth are likely to record the largest rises in rents,\u201d the report said. If interest rates aren\u2019t cut, rent could rise between eight and 15 per cent on average. [6]\n\nThe report also calculates the impact on rents should a coalition government be returned. It showed rent costs could rise three to nine per cent if interest rates are cut by half a per cent under the coalition. [6]\n\nThe figure Mr Morrison quoted of a 22 per cent rise in Brisbane rents is based on the upper limit of an increase in Brisbane if there is no interest rate cut under a Labor government. It is the highest increase listed across all capital cities or national average. There was no comparative figure of the impact of no interest rate cut under a coalition government as this scenario was not modelled in this report. The closest comparison was a half per cent interest rate cut under a coalition government which showed rents in Brisbane would also rise between eight to 13 per cent. [6]\n\nAAP FactCheck found Mr Bowen\u2019s claim that the report Mr Morrison used to attack Labor\u2019s negative gearing reform also shows rents rising under his government to be true.", "lang": "en"}
