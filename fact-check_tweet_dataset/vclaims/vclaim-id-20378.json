And, as he did in past campaign speeches, Trump spoke for a long time and reeled off numerous false and misleading claims:\n\u2022 Trump exaggerated when he claimed that his administration has deported MS-13 gang members \u201cby the thousands.\u201d It is by the hundreds, not thousands.\n\u2022 Trump said he is pushing repeal of the federal estate tax so \u201cfarms can be passed on\u201d to farmers\u2019 children and grandchildren. Actually, the tax falls on fewer than one-half of 1 percent of farm estates.\n\u2022 Trump was wrong when he said that \u201call\u201d insurance companies have \u201cfled the state of Iowa\u201d and that \u201cthey\u2019re leaving all of the states.\u201d One insurer plans to offer Iowa policies on HealthCare.gov in 2018, and 44 counties in three states are currently at risk of having no insurer.\n\u2022 Trump again claimed he has reversed the trend of coal mining job losses, and misleadingly pointed to the opening of a new coal mine in Pennsylvania as evidence that his policies have led to a resurgence in coal mining. Neither of those is true.\n\u2022 Trump disputed the characterization of the Paris Agreement as not legally binding. \u201cLike hell it\u2019s nonbinding,\u201d he said. The fact is, signatories of the agreement are not penalized for failing to adhere to their proposed emissions cuts.\n\u2022 Trump proposed a new law to bar new immigrants from receiving welfare for five years, but a 20-year-old law already does that, with some exceptions.\n\u2022 Trump said, \u201cAs of a few months ago, our country has spent $6 trillion in the Middle East\u201d since 2001. Actually, the U.S. has spent about $1.7 trillion, as of Sept. 30, 2016. The $6 trillion figure is an estimate of the cost over the next four decades.\n\nThe president visited Iowa on June 21, making an official stop first at Kirkwood Community College in Cedar Rapids to talk about agriculture. Later that evening, Trump spoke to a large crowd in the nearby U.S. Cellular Center at a political rally organized by his campaign.\n\nAt his rally, Trump exaggerated when he claimed that his administration had deported MS-13 gang members \u201cby the thousands.\u201d It is by the hundreds, not thousands.\n\nTrump is referring to the Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, a gang that was formed by Salvadoran immigrants in Los Angeles in the 1980s. In April, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that there are 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the United States. That made us skeptical of the claim that \u201cthousands\u201d already had been deported.\n\nWe asked the White House how many gang members have been removed under the Trump administration, but it declined to comment.\n\nHowever, the Washington Post on May 24 wrote that this year the U.S. has deported 398 gang members to El Salvador \u201ccompared with 534 in all of 2016, according to Salvadoran government statistics.\u201d Those figures represent members of all El Salvador gangs, such as MS-13 and the 18th Street gang. MS-13 is \u201cprimarily El Salvadoran,\u201d according to a 2005 National Gang Threat Assessment report by the National Alliance of Gang Investigators Association, though it\u2019s possible there are members from other countries.\n\nDanielle Bennett, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told us in an email that so far in fiscal year 2017 \u2014 from Oct. 1, 2016, to June 4, 2017 \u2014 ICE has removed 2,798 gang members. But that includes all gang members, not just MS-13 members. She said ICE \u201cdoes not track gang removals by specific gang,\u201d so it does not know how many of the 2,798 were MS-13 members. The 2,798 removals also span both the Obama and Trump administrations, so not all of the FY 2017 deportations occurred under Trump.\n\nBy contrast, there were 2,057 gang members deported in fiscal 2016, so there has been an increase this fiscal year. We don\u2019t know how much of that is attributable to Trump\u2019s policies, but Bennett said that ICE under the Trump administration \u201cdoes specifically target MS-13 members for arrest and removal.\u201d That appears to be corroborated by the statistics from El Salvador published in the Post.\n\nBennett also said that ICE Homeland Security Investigations has made 602 criminal arrests and 170 administrative immigration arrests of MS-13 members so far in fiscal year 2017, as of June 4. But those figures include arrests made under both administrations, and the criminal arrests include citizens and noncitizens alike. For example, ICE reported last month that it arrested 104 MS-13 gang members as part of a six-week anti-gang enforcement operation that resulted in 1,378 arrests from March 26 to May 6. But nearly two-thirds of all those arrested were U.S. citizens, so most would not have been eligible for deportation.\n\nTrump can take credit perhaps for cracking down on gang members and increasing the deportation rate of gang members from El Salvador. But he exaggerates when he says he is deporting MS-13 gang members \u201cby the thousands.\u201d\n\nUpdate, July 5: The U.S. has deported 580 gang members to El Salvador in the first half of 2017, from Jan. 1 to June 30, according to the Salvadoran government. That figure includes all gang members, not just those with MS-13.\n\nIn the farming state of Iowa, Trump repeatedly played on the mythical claim that the federal estate tax is keeping family farms from being passed on to the next generation of farmers.\n\nFirst, in his speech at Kirkwood Community College in Cedar Rapids, the president said:\n\nAnd at his rally later that evening, he said the estate tax should go because, \u201cYou should have a right to pass your farm onto your children and onto your grandchildren.\u201d\n\nThe fact is, however, that more than 99 percent of all farms are expected to be passed on without paying any estate tax at all. Repeal of the federal estate tax would benefit only the very wealthiest multimillionaires. And even the few who owe any tax may spread payments out over more than a decade.\n\nA March 15 study by the Economic Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that 38,328 farms would become part of estates in 2016, of which only 0.42 percent \u2014 161 estates \u2014 would owe any estate tax at all.\n\nAll of those would be multimillion-dollar farms; only estates worth $5.45 million or more must file a return, and most of them don\u2019t owe any tax. For those who do owe tax, the study estimated that the average effective rate would be 20 percent \u2014 with the option of spreading payments over 14 years.\n\nSeparate research by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center puts the number even lower. TPC estimates that only 50 farms and closely held businesses will pay any estate tax in 2017.\n\nAnd regardless of whether the number is 161 or 50, those farm estates that owe any tax at all have the option to spread installments over 14 years at reduced interest rates.\n\nWhen we wrote about this estate-tax myth in 2015, we reached out to Neil Harl, an Iowa State University professor of economics and agriculture, who has been studying the estate tax\u2019s impact on small businesses and farms for decades.\n\n\u201cI have been involved in this area since 1958 and I have never seen land that had to be sold to pay the federal estate tax and I have conducted more than 3,400 seminars in 43 states which included federal estate tax planning,\u201d Harl wrote to us in an email. The italics were his. And for this article, we checked back with him, and he said that is still the case.\n\n\u201cThe lobbyists early on, I am told, concluded farmers as a group are more highly respected than billionaires, at least on this issue,\u201d he added.\n\nStill an Insurer in Iowa\n\nTrump wrongly claimed that \u201call\u201d insurance companies have left the individual market in Iowa. In fact, Medica Health announced on Monday that it would stay in the market statewide.\n\nThe president further claimed that insurers are \u201cleaving all of the states.\u201d There are currently 44 counties in three states with no insurer for 2018, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nIowa\u2019s individual insurance marketplace \u2014 where those who get Affordable Care Act subsidies buy their own insurance \u2014 has had a shaky outlook for 2018. Before Medica\u2019s announcement on Monday, the state was unsure if the insurance carrier would participate next year. Two other insurers \u2014 Aetna and Wellmark \u2014 had already said they wouldn\u2019t sell plans on the state marketplace in 2018, leaving Medica as potentially the sole statewide insurer. (Gundersen Health Plan sells policies in five of the state\u2019s 99 counties, Iowa\u2019s Insurance Division says.)\n\nIowa\u2019s Insurance Division said it was \u201cunlikely these carriers will remain\u201d in 2018 and proposed on June 12 to the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services a \u201cstopgap measure\u201d to retool the state\u2019s ACA marketplace, where 72,000 Iowans now get coverage. That stopgap measure would change the income-based tax credits to age- and income-based assistance; create one plan rather than the metal levels of the ACA (bronze, silver, gold, platinum); and add funding to a state reinsurance program to help insurers cover high-cost individuals.\n\nIowa\u2019s Insurance Division confirmed to FactCheck.org that Medica was the only insurer to file 2018 proposed rates by this week\u2019s deadline; Gundersen did not.\n\nMedica\u2019s announcement was widely reported, and it said its 2018 plans would come with a 43 percent average premium increase. Iowa Insurance Commissioner Doug Ommen said the state would still move forward with the stopgap proposal, and he expressed concern about Medica\u2019s average rate increase driving away younger and healthier policyholders.\n\nMedica CEO John Naylor told CNBC on June 16 that the company wanted certainty from the federal government on whether cost-sharing subsidies for low-income individuals would continue. In late May, the Trump administration and House of Representatives asked for a 90-day delay to the federal lawsuit on the matter, according to Politico.\n\n\u201cWhen the federal government set out certain rules, our expectations are that these rules are followed,\u201d Naylor told CNBC. \u201cSo as we look at pricing we need to know are those rules going to be enforced in 2018.\u201d\n\nTrump greatly exaggerated when he claimed that insurance companies are \u201cleaving all of the states.\u201d As of June 21, there were 44 counties, with 31,268 insurance enrollees, at risk of having no insurance carrier for 2018, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, which relied on state rate filings and media reports. Those counties are in three states: Ohio, Missouri and Washington. However, the analysis notes that the insurer Centene said it would expand its insurance business in several states, including those three, but hasn\u2019t detailed exactly where.\n\n\u201cInsurer participation in 2018 will not be finalized until fall of 2017,\u201d KFF says.\n\nTrump again claimed he has reversed the trend of coal mining job losses, and misleadingly pointed to the opening of a new coal mine in Western Pennsylvania as evidence that his policies have led to a resurgence in coal mining. Neither of those is true.\n\nIn fact, there has been an increase of about 1,000 coal mining jobs since January, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For some perspective, there has been a total loss of nearly 40,000 coal mining jobs over the last five years.\n\nHow does Trump get to 33,000? After talking specifically about coal mining, Trump cites a figure for all mining jobs \u2013 including gas, oil, metal ores, coal and nonmetallic mineral mining and quarrying. There have been 32,600 total mining jobs added since January. We wrote about this issue once before when EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt tried a similar sleight of hand.\n\nAs for the grand opening of the Corsa Coal Company\u2019s Acosta Deep Mine near Pittsburgh on June 8, that had nothing to do with Trump\u2019s efforts to roll back coal regulations. As we wrote when Trump made similar boasts earlier this month, development of the Acosta mine began in September, two months before Trump\u2019s election victory.\n\nIndustry experts also tell us it is not emblematic of a resurgence of coal mining.\n\nThe Acosta mine produces a particular type of coal that is used to make steel. That\u2019s a bit of a niche market in the coal industry, accounting for just 10 percent of coal production in the U.S. There has been a surge in demand for this kind of coal because of production problems overseas.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of coal produced in the U.S. is thermal coal, the kind used to generate electricity. Consumption of that kind of coal has declined by nearly 18 percent between 2012 and 2016, mostly due to the surge in cheaper natural gas production driven by the shale revolution and to competition from renewable energy.\n\nEnvironmental regulations \u2014 which Trump has targeted \u2014 also hurt coal mining, but according to an April report from Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy, those regulations were a \u201csignificantly smaller factor\u201d in the shrinking of the coal industry. Industry experts say Trump\u2019s efforts to roll back those regulations might stem the decline in coal consumption, but would not bring coal mining jobs back to levels seen even a few years ago.\n\nTrump touted his decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, which he said would have been an economic \u201ccatastrophe\u201d for the U.S. The agreement, which took effect last year, was signed by 195 countries and primarily aims to keep warming \u201cwell below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\u201d and to pursue \u201cefforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C.\u201d\n\nThe president pushed back at critics who said the pact is nonbinding.\n\n\u201cAnd they all say it\u2019s nonbinding,\u201d he said. \u201cLike hell it\u2019s nonbinding. When we get sued by everybody because we thought it was nonbinding, then you can tell me it was nonbinding.\u201d\n\nThere are aspects of the agreement that are legally binding. Todd Stern, a former U.S. special envoy for climate change, explained in a press conference shortly before the agreement was reached that countries must submit \u201cnationally determined contributions\u201d that outline their emissions targets and report actions taken to meet those targets. But meeting emissions targets wasn\u2019t one of the legal requirements.\n\nStern wrote a May 8 op-ed for the Washington Post urging Trump to stay in the Paris Agreement. He said the president should \u201ckeep in mind that \u2014 as much as I would be sorry to see any retrenchment \u2014 countries can adjust their emissions targets downward. The agreement permits it, and I know because I helped negotiate that flexibility.\u201d\n\nTrump said he was promoting legislation that would bar new immigrants from receiving welfare for five years, but a 20-year-old law already does that. He introduced his proposal after promising to preserve the \u201csafety net\u201d for people who \u201ctruly need help.\u201d\n\nBut as The Hill pointed out, such a law already exists. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, signed into law in 1996 by then-President Bill Clinton, states that immigrants are \u201cnot eligible for any Federal means-tested public benefit for a period of 5 years beginning on the date of the alien\u2019s entry into the United States.\u201d That would include such benefits as food stamps, Medicaid and Social Security.\n\nAs USA Today noted, there are some exceptions in the law for children and pregnant women, refugees, and active duty military or veterans. It\u2019s possible, the story notes, that Trump is seeking to toughen the restrictions, or to eliminate some exceptions. Trump\u2019s proposed FY 2018 budget notes that refugees are exempt from the five-year waiting period, and stresses the need to control the cost of benefits paid to immigrant-headed households. But it offered no details on how that would be accomplished beyond reducing the number of refugees, curbing illegal immigration and increasing merit-based legal immigration.\n\nWe reached out to Trump\u2019s press office for clarification, but it declined to provide any information on the record.\n\nTrump also repeated the claim that the U.S. already has spent $6 trillion in the Middle East since 2001. It hasn\u2019t.\n\nActually, the U.S. has spent about $1.7 trillion through fiscal year 2016, which ended Sept. 30, 2016, according to a February report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump made the $6 trillion figure a talking point. For example, in Philadelphia, he gave a speech in which he said, \u201cWe must declare our independence from a failed establishment that has squandered $6 trillion on foreign wars in the Middle East that never end and that we never win and that have made us less safe.\u201d\n\nHis campaign at the time cited a Reuters news article about a study that projected the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will cost the U.S. $6 trillion \u201cover the next four decades.\u201d The story said the cost estimate included \u201cfuture commitments, such as the medical and disability claims of U.S. war veterans.\u201d\n\nIt may be that the wars eventually will cost the U.S. $6 trillion. However, Trump said the U.S. \u201chas spent $6 trillion\u201d (past tense) as of \u201ca few months ago.\u201d That\u2019s not accurate.", "lang": "en"}
