The claim is misleading; both the hotel and the city\u2019s tourism board issued statements saying the hotel had remained open despite flooding in the region; keyword searches for references to a closure in customer reviews for the hotel in July 2020 yielded no results.\n\nThe video was published here on Twitter on July 19, 2020. It has been viewed more than 137,000 times.\n\nThe 13-second video shows a building surrounded by water. A simplified Chinese-language sign can be seen among sunken guardrails. It translates to English as \u201cMoon Pier\u201d.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption, also written in simplified Chinese characters, translates to English as: \u201cSheraton Huzhou Hot Spring Resort is closed and has no way to enter. The designer didn't take Lake Tai's historical maximum water level into account, which leads to the stupid mistake today.\u201d\n\nSheraton Huzhou Hot Spring Resort is a luxury hotel located on the banks of Lake Tai in Huzhou, China.\n\nThe hotel can be seen here in Huzhou on Baidu Maps.\n\nHuzhou city experienced flooding in July 2020, Chinese state media organisation Xinhua reported here on July 7.\n\nThe video was also shared here, here and here on Twitter, alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim, however, is misleading; the hotel says it was not forced to close in July 2020.\n\nA keyword search on Weibo found this July 18, 2020 statement published on the official account of the Sheraton Huzhou Hot Spring Resort.\n\nThe simplified Chinese headline translates to English as \u201cRumour refutation!\u201d\n\nThe release reads in part: \u201cSheraton Huzhou Hot Spring Resort (known as \"Moon Hotel\") has been operating normally. Except for the rising water level of the surrounding Moon Square area and the temporary closure of cruise ships, the hotel has not been affected by the rising water level of Lake Tai, and there is no ponding or even flooding within the hotel, also the traffic around the hotel has not been affected. The online contents are all rumours.\u201d\n\nThe Huzhou Cultural Tourism Bureau also published the hotel\u2019s statement here on its official WeChat account on July 19, 2020.\n\nA search on both Weibo and China-based online travel agency Ctrip about flooding at or closure of the hotel in July 2020 also produced no results.", "lang": "en"}
