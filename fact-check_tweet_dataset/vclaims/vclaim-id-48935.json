Along with the message, a link is also provided. Although it is May, but the message is still circulating online across social media with the link. Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral post is fake.\n\nVishvas News received a message on Whatsapp which read: FREE INTERNET RECHARGE FROM World Health Organization. Get 1GB data per day till 30th April. You can\u2019t access adult content using data provided by WHO. Click Here and Get Now. http://bit.ly/WHO-Recharge.\n\nVishvas news started its investigation by clicking on the link given in the viral message. After clicking on the link we landed to a website\n\nhttp://who-recharge.blogspot.com/ It was a blogging website that had been removed.\n\nWe spoke to India representative of World Health Organization (WHO). She said: \u201cPlease spread a word that this is fake. WHO has not offered free data.\u201d\n\nWHO has also cautioned against criminals pretending to be WHO. It states: Hackers and cyber scammers are taking advantage of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic by sending fraudulent email and WhatsApp messages that attempt to trick you into clicking on malicious links or opening attachments.\n\nConclusion: WHO did not offer free 1GB data. The viral message is fake.\n\nFact-checking journalism, which holds mirror to power while being free from the ropes of corporate and politics, is possible only with support from public.
