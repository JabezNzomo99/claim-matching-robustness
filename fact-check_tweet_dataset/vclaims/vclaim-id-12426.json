The claim is false; the misleading video actually shows the unsuccessful launch of Russia\u2019s Proton-M rocket in July 2013.\n\nThe video can be seen in this February 11, 2019 Facebook post by Siasat24.com, a Pakistani media website that has more than 40,000 followers on Facebook.\n\nThe 45-second video shows a failed rocket launch -- a projectile soaring into the sky before gradually turning upside down and falling and then exploding on the ground.\n\nThe Urdu-language caption of the post translates as: \u201cThe successful test of India's latest missile. All Pakistanis got worried. Laughing is not allowed\u201d, followed by two laughing and a surprised face emoji.\n\nThe video has been viewed at least 224,000 times since it was posted on Facebook February 11, 2019. The post has also been shared on other social media, for example here on Twitter.\n\nA reverse image search, however, shows that the footage actually shows the failed launch of Russia\u2019s Proton-M rocket at its Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on July 2, 2013.\n\nThere are multiple media reports about the unsuccessful rocket launch from 2013, for example a report here on Space Daily on the explosion, and reports here from Russia Today and here from DNI about what caused the accident.\n\nHere is the video of the incident posted on Russia Today's official YouTube account:\n\nThere are also multiple videos on YouTube shot by eyewitnesses at the scene and uploaded in July 2013, such as here and here.\n\nThe eyewitness videos have been shot from different angles, but the same rocket launch trajectory as features in both the misleading footage and the RT footage can clearly be seen.\n\nThe footage used in the misleading video is a cropped version of the footage from Tsenki, Russia's state space infrastructure company.\n\nBelow is the Tsenki footage of the disaster, which was posted on YouTube by Martin Vit on May 19, 2014. The Tsenki logo can clearly be seen in the upper right hand corner of the video:\n\nBelow are comparisons between Russia Today\u2019s footage of the July 2, 2013 Proton-M rocket launch failure and the footage used in the misleading Facebook post, demonstrating that the two videos depict the same incident:", "lang": "en"}
