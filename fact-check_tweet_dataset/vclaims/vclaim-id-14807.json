The video\u2019s caption says: \"No workers present at the time that the Notre Dame Cathedral fire started......So who is this guy dressed in Muslim garb??\"\n\nThe video post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe person in the picture isn\u2019t dressed in \"Muslim garb\" \u2014 the person is a firefighter.\n\nThe clip was plucked from CNBC\u2019s three-hour livestream of the fire and can be seen around the 42-minute mark.\n\nBecause the clip used in the Facebook post is blurry, pixelated and cropped, it\u2019s difficult to make out the firefighter's uniform or see the wider angle of water hoses being employed to the right of the tower. When viewing the official, full-length video, the man\u2019s yellow vest and helmet are clear and, moments later, several more firefighters show up in the same area.\n\nThe clip was also shared on Twitter, and European fact-checking outfits FactCheck EU and Check News both called out the bogus claim that a lone man was up to something sinister in the tower.\n\n\"No, there was no \u2018lone man in a yellow vest\u2019 in one of the Notre-Dame towers,\" FactCheck EU tweeted. \"A low quality video was the basis of the bogus claim that a mysterious man in a yellow vest was in a tower. This higher quality image shows that it's a fireman. Firefighters were already on the scene.\"\n\nWhile the exact cause of the fire is not yet known, French media reported that Paris prosecutor R\u00e9mi Heitz said in a press conference there is \"no indication that this was a deliberate act,\" and that it appeared to be accidental.\n\nHeitz also said that Paris police had already mobilized nearly 50 investigators to look into the fire and that investigators have started to interview about 15 workers who were working at the cathedral as part of the 6 million-euro ($6.8 million) renovation. The Paris fire brigade has been quoted as saying the blaze may be \"potentially linked\" to the project.\n\nA video clip posted on social media showed a man walking alone in one of Notre Dame\u2019s towers \"dressed in Muslim garb.\"\n\nThe clip is from an authentic media live stream of the Notre Dame fire, but displays a lower-quality and cropped version that doesn\u2019t allow the viewer to clearly see it was a firefighter. The clip also doesn\u2019t last long enough to show other firefighters who show up in the same area moments later, and is cropped to omit the water hoses being used to fight the fire.\n\nFrench authorities are conducting an investigation into the fire, but preliminary reports, so far, deem the cause as accidental, pointing to a possible link to the cathedral\u2019s renovation project.\n\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
