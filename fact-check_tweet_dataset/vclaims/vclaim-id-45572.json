At least 10 unique links from these two websites were flagged by Claim Check, Facebook\u2019s monitoring tool. The links were shared as early as May 29.\n\nThe websites redirected to 2k18posttrends.info, which showed a very similar web page containing the same video. When clicked, the video showed anchor Mike Enriquez doing the news: \u201cMay malungkot po tayong balita. Tuluyan nang pinugutan ang isang OFW sa Saudi Arabia\u2026 (We have sad news. An OFW in Saudi Arabia was beheaded\u2026)\u201d\n\n\n\nYouTube channel Aksyon Balita PH uploaded the clip that was embedded in the web pages. The video\u2019s title also claimed that the OFW was beheaded after testing positive. It had 101,850 views on YouTube as of writing.\n\nThe facts: The news clip embedded was from a 2015 report by GMA News \u2013 way before an outbreak of the novel coronavirus was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019.\n\nThere were no recent reports from any legitimate news organization about the beheading of a female OFW in Saudi after testing positive for the coronavirus.\n\nRappler found the full and original news clip uploaded on the verified YouTube channel of GMA News. It was posted on March 9, 2015, and was about the beheading of Joven Esteva, a male OFW executed after he was convicted for murdering his employer.\n\nThe original report also cited former foreign affairs spokesperson Charles Jose, who confirmed the beheading of Esteva in 2015. Jose is now the Philippine ambassador to Malaysia as of June 2020.\n\nYouTube channel Aksyon Balita PH had also uploaded videos containing hoaxes in the past, such as the supposed deaths of actors John Lloyd Cruz and Robin Padilla. Though it used the logo of GMA News in its icon, it was not listed as a featured channel by GMA News' official YouTube account.\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
