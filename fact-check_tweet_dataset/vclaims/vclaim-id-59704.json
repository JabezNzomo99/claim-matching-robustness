In response to our question asking whether the program had been canceled, the company sent the following statement:\n\nWe plan to continue to support children with Heroes & Helpers events across the country this holiday season. Like many of our holiday programs, we\u2019re carefully considering how to manage these events during the COVID-19 environment in a way that ensures the health and safety of our team and guests. We will have additional details to share as we approach the holiday season.\n\nThe program was launched in 2009 and takes place in stores nationwide. To date, $5 million in grants has been used to support the shopping trips, and more than 100,000 children and 60,000 police officers have participated, per Target.\n\nThe false social media rumors may have been inspired by the fact that since the May 25, 2020, death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody, there have been ongoing protests against and conversation about police violence and racism in America, spurring calls to reform policing practices and even some activists calling for police departments to be defunded.\n\nHowever, Target, as of this writing, doesn\u2019t plan to cancel the program as a result of the racial justice protests. With the information currently available, we rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
