Omar\u2019s remarks in context", "subtitle": "The remarks of the freshman member of Congress during an address to a Muslim rights organization spawned controversy, but they were just a snippet of a 20-minute speech.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2019-04-11T07:00:33.866Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-86242", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/04/11/some-people-did-something-rep-omars-remarks-context/", "vclaim": "But CAIR was not alone in that designation; nearly 250 other organizations and individuals were also named. The federal government said the organizations were included on the list to produce evidence at the trial, but the district court and a federal appeals court later ruled that it had been a mistake to make the list public. CAIR\u2019s association with groups later deemed to have links to terrorism predated any official U.S. designation.\n\n\u201cMany people expect our community to feel like it needs to hide every time something happens,\u201d she said. \u201cBut repeatedly we have shown them that we are not to be bullied, not to be threatened, we are not to be terrorized, we are strong and resilient, and we will always show up to be ourselves because we know we have a right to a dignified existence and a dignified life.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of us knew this would get worse, we finally have a leader, a world leader, in the White House who publicly says \u2018Islam hates us,\u2019 who fuels hate against Muslims, who thinks it is okay to speak about a faith and a whole community in a way that is dehumanizing, vilifying and doesn\u2019t understand \u2014 or at least makes us want to think he doesn\u2019t understand \u2014 the consequences his words might have,\u201d she said.\n\nOmar argued that even a \u201cgood Muslim\u201d may find roadblocks in the United States \u2014 and that that was the moment to stand up for one\u2019s rights. \u201cOnce you are willing to stand up for yourself \u2026 then others will show up for you,\u201d she said. She ticked off several examples, such as a Muslim being unable to find a place to pray in a hospital, even in \u201ca country that was founded on religious liberty.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the truth. For far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and, frankly, I\u2019m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it. CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties. So you can\u2019t just say that today someone is looking at me strange and that I am trying to make myself look pleasant. You have to say that this person is looking at me strange, I am not comfortable with it, and I am going to talk to them and ask them why. Because that is the right you have.\u201d\n\nIn the speech, Omar defended herself from criticism that she was too critical of some Islamic countries, such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia, for their human rights records. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if that country is being run by my father, my brother, my sister,\u201d she said. \u201cI will still criticize that country because I know every country is capable of living up to its best.\u201d\n\n\"Women who cover their heads in this country must feel comfortable going outside their homes. Moms who wear cover must be not intimidated in America. That\u2019s not the America I know. That\u2019s not the America I value. I\u2019ve been told that some fear to leave; some don\u2019t want to go shopping for their families; some don\u2019t want to go about their ordinary daily routines because, by wearing cover, they\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll be intimidated. That should not and that will not stand in America. Those who feel like they can intimidate our fellow citizens to take out their anger don\u2019t represent the best of America, they represent the worst of humankind, and they should be ashamed of that kind of behavior.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
