They have been going around since President Bill Clinton was in office.\n\nNow, a new rumor on Facebook says Chelsea Clinton\u2019s former bodyguard \"Jack Gordon\" was found dead in the Ohio River in early 2019 after he started telling prosecutors damaging information he had obtained on the job.\n\nThe post features a photo of a man has text overlaid that says: \"This is Jack Gordon. He was Chelsea Clinton\u2019s bodyguard until August 2018. Soon after his termination he started talking to federal prosecutors about damaging information he had obtained. In January of 2019 his body was found floating in the Ohio river near WV. His phone and computer had been smashed.\"\n\nThe post was published on Feb. 24 and has been shared close to 400 times. It was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

In the late 1990s, Gordon apparently briefly represented Paula Jones, a pivotal figure in the impeachment trial of Bill Clinton, who said Clinton harassed her.\n\nA version of the dead body guard rumor appears to have started with a blog post published Feb. 10 on America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, a website known for publishing misleading content, defining itself as \"satirical.\" Still, some users share the blog\u2019s stories as if they are true.\n\nThe junk website said the body belonged to a Hillary Clinton aide named \"Jaeger Holpern,\" which is an anagram for the blog\u2019s author, \"Jolee Garphren.\" The story also claimed Holpern worked as Chelsea Clinton\u2019s bodyguard until November 2018.\n\nThe site lists this disclaimer: \"Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site\u2019s pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical.\"\n\nAs rumors often do, this one appears to have morphed. It started as a satire blog post and eventually became a meme that featured a known actor\u2019s photograph and used the name \"Jack Gordon\" as Chelsea Clinton\u2019s former bodyguard.\n\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
