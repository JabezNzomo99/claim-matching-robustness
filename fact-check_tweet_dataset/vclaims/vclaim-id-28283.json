Let\u2019s analyze the authenticity of the claim in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Video of a \u2018Hindu\u2019 woman being assaulted in Pakistan. Fact: The woman in the video is Amrat Shahzadi D/o Mohammed Suleman Ansari. She was attacked by the Advocates Yasir Khan, Waseem Latif and Asif Sultan. So, the woman is a \u2018Muslim\u2019 and she wasn\u2019t attacked on the basis of her \u2018religion\u2019. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched on Google with the text \u2018Woman beaten up by lawyers in Pakistan\u2019, an article of \u2018Geo Tv\u2019 with the stills seen in the video was obtained. As per the article, the incident occurred outside Shakargarh court after a brawl between a group of lawyers and Amrat, the woman who had come for an appearance at the court hearing.\n\nWhen searched on Twitter to find information regarding the incident, a tweet by Tahir Imran Mian, a journalist with \u2018BBC Urdu\u2019 was found. The tweet had an image of FIR copy of that incident and as per the FIR copy, Advocates Yasir Khan, Waseem Latif and Asif Sultan have dragged Amrat Shahzadi D/o Mohammed Suleman Ansari from the chamber of Advocate Md. Atif to the road and have attacked her. So, it was found that the woman is a \u2018Muslim\u2019 and she wasn\u2019t attacked on the basis of her \u2018religion\u2019.\n\nTo conclude, in the video, the woman assaulted by lawyers is not a \u2018Hindu\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
