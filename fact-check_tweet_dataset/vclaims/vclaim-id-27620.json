Grossman acknowledged that in on June 9 he had heard from Wilson that he might write an article after then-national security adviser Condoleezza Rice appeared to dismiss the importance of the trip in television interviews. (\u201cHe was really mad,\u201d Grossman testified. \u201cPeople were not taking him seriously.\") Another witness said he had no memory of Grossman saying the information had been requested by Libby and would have remembered if Grossman had mentioned it.\n\nLibby was charged and convicted of misleading investigators about his conversations with reporters, in particular a claim that he received information about Plame from NBC\u2019s Tim Russert. But the only article that directly can be traced to Libby is the item in Time magazine \u2014 in which one could argue he only tangentially confirmed information already obtained by the reporter \u2014 and the jury acquitted Libby on the charge of lying about what he told Cooper. No evidence emerged at trial that Libby had seen the State Department memo or that he knew Plame had a covert status.\n\nThere is no question that Scooter Libby was part of a group of Bush White House senior advisers who sought revenge for Ambassador Joe Wilson\u2019s 2003 New York Times Op-Ed asserting that the intelligence used to invade Iraq was \u201ccherry picked\u201d and an imminent Iraqi nuclear threat was, in fact, false. The White House conspirators retaliated against Ambassador Wilson by compromising the CIA covert status of his wife, Valerie Plame \u2013 putting her and others at great risk. They pushed Ms. Plame\u2019s name and their false narrative to at least half a dozen Washington, DC reporters. The one who took the bait and published her name in his syndicated column was Robert Novak.\n\nThere is ample evidence that Libby did indeed give Ms. Plame\u2019s name to several reporters. Whether or not the reporters printed Plame\u2019s name does not negate Libby\u2019s involvement in revealing her identity. As evidenced at both the first and second Grand Jury testimonies in 2005 by New York Times reporter Judith Miller, Libby did in fact leak Valerie\u2019s identity to Miller as part of a retaliatory conspiracy. Years later in her 2015 book, Judith Miller recanted her testimony - under no danger of committing perjury. It is notable that while under oath, she testified that Libby did reveal Plame\u2019s identity to her.", "lang": "en"}
