Rather, he said they \u201cdid nothing wrong and did not violate any of the quarantine rules.\u201d The graphic containing the statement also did not come from News5.\n\nOn April 19, Casilao and 6 volunteers were arrested in Norzagaray, Bulacan while they were on their way to deliver relief goods to residents affected by the Luzon lockdown. Casilao's group said they had food passes issued by the national director of the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources.\n\n\"It was an attack on activists carrying out humanitarian activities [which] adhered to the bayanihan spirit in this time of an emergency situation,\u201d Casilao said.\n\nAlthough the graphic had News5\u2019s logo on it, it was not available on the official Facebook and Twitter accounts of the media organization. The graphic was also inconsistent with the design of the quote cards News5 posts on its official channels, which include a date and a footer of its social media handles.\n\nRappler also reached out to two social media users who posted the graphic publicly on their accounts to ask for their source. One said the graphic was only forwarded to him via a messaging app but said he thinks \"it is edited.\" The other account did not respond. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
