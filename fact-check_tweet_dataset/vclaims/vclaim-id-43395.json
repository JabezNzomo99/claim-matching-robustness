A voice is heard talking about \"information from a knowledgeable source\" before that audio is drowned out by edited-in music from the song \"Can We Kiss Forever?\"\n\nFact-checkers in India and France matched the visual of the body bags and the audio of the voice in the clip to a scene from \"Pandemic.\"\n\nThe actual scene from \"Pandemic\" shows a fictional reporter broadcasting about the so-called \"riptide virus\" as the body bags are seen tumbling. Here\u2019s what the reporter says:\n\n\"Though unsubstantiated by state and city authorities, we now have information from a knowledgeable source that tells us that the city's temporary morgues are filled beyond capacity. Mass graves have been dug for the incineration and burial of the dead. The current death toll due to the riptide virus is now in the thousands and growing.\"\n\nYou can watch the full clip from \"Pandemic\" here.\n\nItaly has seen a high death toll as a result of the coronavirus, which was first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. According to the World Health Organization, the country had recorded 139,422 confirmed cases and 17,669 deaths from COVID-19 as of April 9.\n\nBut the clip passed off by Facebook users as footage of the \"situation in Italy\" is lifted from a 2007 TV series about a fictional pandemic.", "lang": "en"}
