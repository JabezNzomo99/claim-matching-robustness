Bernie Sanders had \u201clied\u201d in saying Trump supported a minimum wage below $7.25. In fact, Trump told NBC News in May that he didn\u2019t support a federal \u201cfloor\u201d and would leave it up to the states. Sanders got it right.\n\u2022 Trump insisted again that Vladimir Putin called him a \u201cgenius,\u201d even though Putin clarified just last month that he called Trump \u201cflamboyant.\u201d\n\u2022 We found no evidence to corroborate Trump\u2019s claim that Putin \u201cmentioned the N-word one time.\u201d Two experts on Russia told us they had no idea what Trump was talking about.\n\u2022 Trump claimed with no evidence that Hillary Clinton deleted emails from her private server \u201cafter she gets a subpoena\u201d from Congress.\n\u2022 There\u2019s also no evidence for Trump\u2019s repeated claim that \u201cmany people\u201d saw or knew about \u201cbombs lying all over the floor\u201d of the San Bernardino shooters\u2019 home and didn\u2019t report it.\n\u2022 Trump said Blue Cross Blue Shield in Texas had \u201cannounced a 60 percent increase\u201d in health insurance premiums. That\u2019s a proposed increase for 2017 that has yet to be approved by regulators for certain plans purchased by those buying their own insurance.\n\nIn the press conference, Trump was right about one top Democrat, Vice President Joe Biden. Trump pointed out that Biden was wrong to say that Trump wanted to \u201ccarpet-bomb\u201d in the Middle East to fight the Islamic State. Sen. Ted Cruz said that.\n\nTrump claimed that Sanders \u201clied\u201d in saying that Trump \u201cwants the minimum wage to go below $7.\u201d But Sanders got his facts right. He said Trump \u201cbelieves that states should actually have the right to lower the minimum wage below $7.25.\u201d And that\u2019s what Trump said.\n\nToday, Trump said the minimum wage should go up to \u201cat least $10,\u201d the first time we could find that he has said that.\n\nFirst, here\u2019s Trump today at his press conference:\n\nTrump went on to say, \u201cIn fact he was criticized by people that fact check for saying it because I never said it.\u201d We at FactCheck.org did not criticize Sanders on this point. In fact, Trump did say he was in favor of having no federal minimum wage. He was asked by NBC News\u2019 Chuck Todd on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on May 8, \u201cshould the federal government set a floor?\u201d And he responded: \u201cNo, I\u2019d rather have the states go out and do what they have to do.\u201d\n\nIt may be difficult to follow Trump\u2019s shifting position on the minimum wage: As Todd noted in that NBC News interview, Trump said in one of the debates that he was against raising it \u2014 \u201cI hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is,\u201d he said in November \u2014 and then months later said he would be \u201copen\u201d to raising it.\n\nHe even told Todd in May that he \u201cwould like to see an increase of some magnitude,\u201d but added that \u201cI\u2019d rather leave it to the states.\u201d However, there is no doubt that he said in that interview that the federal government should not set a floor, leaving states, as Sanders said, \u201cthe right to lower the minimum wage below $7.25.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the full exchange from that May 8 NBC News interview:\n\nNBC News\u2019 Chuck Todd: Minimum wage. Minimum wage. At a debate, you know. You remember what you said. You thought you didn\u2019t want to touch it. Now you\u2019re open to it. What changed? Trump: Let me just tell you, I\u2019ve been traveling the country for many months. Since June 16th. I\u2019m all over. Today I\u2019m in the state of Washington, where the arena right behind me, you probably hear, is packed with thousands and thousands of people. I\u2019m doing that right after I finish you. I have seen what\u2019s going on. And I don\u2019t know how people make it on $7.25 an hour. Now, with that being said, I would like to see an increase of some magnitude. But I\u2019d rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide. Because don\u2019t forget, the states have to compete with each other. So you may have a governor \u2014 Todd: Right. You want the fed\u2013 but should the federal government set a floor, and then you let the states\u2013 Trump: No, I\u2019d rather have the states go out and do what they have to do. And the states compete with each other, not only other countries, but they compete with each other, Chuck. So I like the idea of let the states decide. But I think people should get more. I think they\u2019re out there. They\u2019re working. It is a very low number. You know, with what\u2019s happened to the economy, with what\u2019s happened to the cost. I mean, it\u2019s just\u2013 I don\u2019t know how you live on $7.25 an hour. But I would say let the states decide.\n\nTrump continues to insist that Vladimir Putin called him a \u201cgenius,\u201d even though Russian language experts told us Putin merely called Trump \u201ccolorful\u201d or \u201cbright\u201d \u2014 depending on the translation \u2014 and even after Putin clarified just last month that he never called Trump a genius.\n\nTrump frequently claims that Putin called him a genius, but as we wrote on June 17, that relies on a faulty translation of the Russian president\u2019s faint praise for Trump during a press scrum in December, after Putin was asked what he thought about the Republican candidate.\n\nAccording to a translation by Russia Insider, which uploaded the video, Putin responded, \u201cHe\u2019s a very colorful person. Talented, without any doubt. But it\u2019s not our affair to determine his worthiness \u2014 that\u2019s up to the United States voters. But he is absolutely the leader in the presidential race. He wants to move to a different level of relations, to more solid, deeper relations with Russia. And how can Russia not welcome that \u2014 we welcome that. As for his internal political issues and the turn of speech which he uses to raise his popularity, I repeat, it\u2019s not our affair to evaluate them.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the word \u201ccolorful\u201d in the first sentence of that translation that is at issue here. We reached out to several Russian language experts, and there was some disagreement about the precise meaning of Putin\u2019s phrase, with some translating it as \u201ccolorful,\u201d others \u201cbold\u201d or \u201cbright.\u201d But they all agreed that Trump was inflating Putin\u2019s rather guarded praise, and that Putin most certainly did not go so far as to call Trump a \u201cgenius.\u201d\n\nIn a speech in St. Petersburg, Russia, on June 17, Putin set the record straight, explaining that he had only described Trump as \u201cflamboyant.\u201d According to Reuters, Putin added, with a smile, \u201cHe is, isn\u2019t he? I did not give any other assessment of him.\u201d\n\nWe could find no evidence to corroborate Trump\u2019s claim that Putin \u201cmentioned the N-word one time,\u201d in a sign of \u201ca total lack of respect for President Obama.\u201d\n\nWe scoured the internet and published reports archived by Lexis-Nexis and could not find where Putin ever used that racial epithet. Neither could the Washington Post or CNN, which wrote, \u201cThere are no published reports to back up Trump\u2019s allegation about Putin\u2019s use of the racially derogatory term, however.\u201d\n\nTwo experts on Russia told us via email that they had never heard of Putin using that term.\n\n\u201cIn Russian, the N-word does not begin with \u2018N\u2019 \u2014 and Putin\u2019s English is pretty rudimentary,\u201d said Stephen Sestanovich, an expert on Russia and the former Soviet Union at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\n\u201cI have no idea what [Trump] is talking about,\u201d added Fiona Hill, an expert on Russian affairs and director of the Center on the United States and Europe and a senior fellow in the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution. \u201cPutin doesn\u2019t really speak English. So perhaps Trump is referring to some speech in Russian\u2013but again I have no idea what he is referring to.\u201d\n\nHill, who co-authored the second edition of \u201cMr. Putin: Operative in the Kremlin,\u201d added, \u201cIf it were something in Russian, then the word \u2018negr\u2019 is used widely by Russians who grew up in the Soviet era. It is the literal translation of Negro. When I was a student in the USSR in the late 1980s I heard it many times, used by teachers and students at my institute when talking about Africans and oppressed black Americans, and it was written in textbooks. I have heard it used by Russians of Putin\u2019s generation since, including a couple of Russian officials in conversations. It does sound pretty similar to the \u201cN\u201d word to an English speaker, so it would certainly be shocking out of context.\u201d\n\nWe did come across an article posted by the Conservative Tribune, which carried the headline \u201cWhile Talking ISIS Strategy, Putin Just Dropped The \u201cN\u201d Word\u2026 This Could Change EVERYTHING.\u201d But as the article quickly makes clear, the N-word in question there was \u201cnuclear.\u201d\n\nBut the context of Trump\u2019s comment makes clear that that\u2019s not the N-word to which Trump was referring.\n\nTrump claimed that Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails from the private server she used as secretary of state after she received a congressional subpoena requesting her emails. But there is no evidence to support his claim. In fact, an FBI investigation found no evidence of a cover-up.\n\nTrump, of course, is referring to Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email system for government businesses. As we have written in \u201cA Guide to Clinton\u2019s Emails,\u201d the State Department asked her in the summer of 2014 to turn over any work-related emails that she had in her possession after she had already left the department in February 2013. Her lawyers went through the emails stored on her server, and they identified 30,490 work-related emails and 31,830 private emails.\n\nIn December 2014, Clinton gave the State Department the work-related emails, and the others were deleted. But when did she delete them? We don\u2019t know \u2014 and neither does Trump.\n\nClinton received a subpoena from the House Select Committee on Benghazi on March 4, 2015. The committee requested \u201cany and all documents and communications in your possession.\u201d The request came two days after the New York Times broke the story that she had been using a private email account exclusively for government business.\n\nSix days after receiving a subpoena, Clinton held a press conference on March 10, 2015, to answer questions raised by the Times article. At that press conference, she first disclosed that she deleted her personal emails. \u201cI didn\u2019t see any reason to keep them,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump is assuming that the emails were deleted after March 4, when Clinton was subpoenaed, and perhaps before March 10, when she held her press conference. But her campaign told us for a previous article that the emails were deleted before March 4, although it did not provide us with a date.\n\nFBI Director Jim Comey at a July 5 press conference announced the results of the agency\u2019s investigation into whether Clinton or anyone on her staff violated federal law in the handling of classified information on a private server. He criticized Clinton and her staff for being \u201cextremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,\u201d but cleared them of any criminal wrongdoing.\n\nIn his press conference, Comey said the FBI \u201cdiscovered several thousand work-related e-mails that were not in the group of 30,000 that were returned by Secretary Clinton\u201d to the State Department. He also said Clinton\u2019s lawyers cleaned her server \u201cin such a way as to preclude complete forensic recovery,\u201d but he also said the FBI \u201cfound no evidence that any of the additional work-related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.\u201d\n\nUpdate, Sept. 8: Trump had no evidence at the time, but now he does. The FBI on Sept. 2 released a two-part summary of its investigation of Clinton that said the former secretary of state\u2019s emails were deleted \u201csometime between March 25-31, 2015\u2033 \u2014 three weeks after the congressional subpoena.\n\nHere\u2019s what the FBI report said: By December 2014, Clinton\u2019s lawyers had completed their review of her emails, and sent her work-related emails to the State Department. At that time, a Clinton lawyer told Platte River Networks \u2013 which was maintaining Clinton\u2019s private server \u2013 that the former secretary no longer needed any emails that were more than 60 days old, and instructed an unnamed PRN employee \u201cto modify the e-mail retention policy \u2026 to reflect this change.\u201d The PRN employee told the FBI that \u201csometime between March 25-31, 2015\u2033 he realized he did not make the change requested by Clinton\u2019s office and he deleted her old emails at that time.\n\nClinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin told us that Clinton and her attorneys had no knowledge of the email deletions in late March 2015 until the FBI released its report on Sept. 2.\n\nTrump said Blue Cross Blue Shield in Texas had \u201cannounced a 60 percent increase\u201d in health insurance premiums under Obamacare. To be clear, that\u2019s a proposed increase for 2017 \u2014 it has to be approved by regulators \u2014 for certain plans purchased by those buying their own insurance.\n\nTrump has cherry-picked high rate increases for some plans on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance marketplaces before. As we wrote in April on this issue, there was wide variation in premium changes for plans that individuals purchase on the marketplaces \u2014 ranging from the high increases Trump has touted to double-digit decreases.\n\nIn this case, Blue Cross Blue Shield in Texas has requested rate increases of 57 percent and 59 percent. Any increase above 10 percent has to be submitted and approved by government regulators. A 60 percent jump could well be an outlier. The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation analyzed preliminary rates and estimated a 10 percent rise on average for the second-lowest-cost silver plan in 14 major metropolitan areas.\n\nThat\u2019s double what KFF found actually happened in those metro areas \u2014 a 5 percent increase \u2014 for 2016. Experts have said the marketplace premiums initially came in lower than expected, in 2014, and now are being adjusted based on insurers\u2019 actual experience with consumers. The Urban Institute wrote in November 2015 that it could take a few years before premiums stabilize.\n\nConsumers can switch plans, and many do: The Department of Health and Human Services found 43 percent of returning customers chose a different plan for 2016. And 85 percent of customers qualified for tax credits, insulating them from higher rate hikes.\n\nWe can\u2019t predict whether the final increases for the 2017 marketplace plans will be \u201cthe biggest number ever in our country\u2019s history,\u201d as Trump claims. But we\u2019ll note that increases on the individual market before the ACA was passed topped 10 percent on average.\n\nThose buying plans on the marketplaces totaled nearly 13 million in 2016. In contrast, more than 154 million people get health insurance through their employers. Those premiums rose an average of 4 percent for family plans in 2015, according to the latest employer survey by KFF.\n\nTrump repeated his claim that \u201cmany people\u201d saw or knew there were \u201cbombs lying all over the floor\u201d of the San Bernardino shooters\u2019 home and didn\u2019t report it. There\u2019s no evidence of that.\n\nTrump made a similar claim in mid-June about Muslims being complicit in the Dec. 2, 2015, shooting in San Bernardino, California. He said that \u201cmany people,\u201d including neighbors of the shooters, saw \u201cbombs all over the floor\u201d of the couple\u2019s apartment, but declined to report it because of concerns about racial profiling. As we wrote then, one friend of a neighbor said the neighbor noticed a lot of packages arriving at the house, and that the couple had been doing a lot of work in their garage \u2014 and the neighbor didn\u2019t report it due to racial profiling concerns.\n\nDuring the fifth Republican debate in December, Trump accused the mother of the shooter of having advance knowledge of the attack. The FBI was investigating the matter, but officials have not brought any charges or made any accusation against the mother, whose lawyer says that his client didn\u2019t know what her son was planning.\n\nTrump said that Biden \u201clied\u201d when Biden said Trump stated that he wanted to \u201ccarpet-bomb\u201d in the Middle East to fight the Islamic State. Biden was incorrect. Sen. Ted Cruz, not Trump, said that the U.S. should use carpet-bombing as a strategy against the terrorist organization known as ISIS.\n\nHere\u2019s what Biden said about Trump during an interview on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on July 27 (at 7:10 in the video):\n\nWe can\u2019t say whether Biden \u201clied,\u201d as Trump said. That would mean that Biden knew what he was saying was false. But Biden did get it wrong.\n\nIt was Cruz, the Texas senator and former Republican candidate for president, who talked about carpet-bombing ISIS.\n\n\u201cWe will have a president who will make clear we will utterly destroy ISIS. We will carpet-bomb them into oblivion. I don\u2019t know if sand can glow in the dark, but we\u2019re going to find out,\u201d Cruz said during a campaign event in Iowa on Dec. 5, 2015.\n\nCarpet-bombing, generally, involves dropping many bombs over an area without a specific target. Such a tactic could result in unintended casualties since some ISIS fighters are embedded among civilian populations. That\u2019s one of the reasons that former Defense Secretary Robert Gates said that Cruz\u2019s plan would not work.\n\n\u201cI think most rhetoric about carpet-bombing, about making the sand glow, about bombing them to death and so on is frankly just unrealistic,\u201d Gates said in an interview on Fox Business Network in January.\n\nGates added: \u201cIt\u2019s not going to accomplish the military objective \u2014 it takes no account of civilian casualties. It\u2019s a simplistic answer to what\u2019s a complex and long term problem.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Trump has said multiple times that he would use bombs against ISIS. But he has said that he would specifically target oil fields that ISIS controls in Iraq, Syria and other areas.\n\nOn June 17, 2015, a day after he announced that he was running for president, Trump told ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos that \u201cI would bomb the hell out of them. I\u2019d bomb the fields.\u201d\n\nNearly a month later, he told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper the same thing. \u201cIf I win, I would attack those oil sites that are controlled \u2026 by ISIS,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIn mid-November, the Trump campaign released a radio ad in which Trump says, in a voice-over, \u201cYes, I will quickly and decisively bomb the hell out of ISIS.\u201d That was after Trump, at a campaign rally in Iowa, on Nov. 12, said this:\n\nSo, Trump has called for specifically targeting ISIS-controlled oil fields. A strategy that some in the military have criticized. But that\u2019s different from carpet-bombing, which is what Biden wrongly said Trump wants to do.", "lang": "en"}
