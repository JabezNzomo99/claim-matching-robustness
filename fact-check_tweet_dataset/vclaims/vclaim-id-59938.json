He just did it, no consultation, no proposal at all. It was his choice to do this. And I'll reverse it on day one.\u201d\n\nThe claim from the Conservative mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey that the Mayor of London took the decision to raise the congestion charge needs context.\n\nFollowing the loss of income during the coronavirus pandemic, Transport for London (TfL) asked for a bailout from the UK government. One of the conditions of the bailout was that TfL \u201curgently\u201d bring forward proposals for increasing the congestion charge.\n\nThe congestion charge was then raised.\n\nMr Bailey\u2019s suggestion that the Mayor could have simply put forward the proposals to raise the congestion charge, but not actually enact those changes, while still receiving the bailout, is misleading.\n\nWhy did TfL need a bailout?\n\nFollowing the national lockdown, TfL, which runs most of London\u2019s public transport, saw its revenues drop considerably.\n\nLondon Underground usage dropped to as low as 4% of usual levels and bus usage dropped to as low as 16% of usual levels before TfL stopped collecting bus fares, and thus bus data, on 17 April.\n\nThe Mayor, Sadiq Khan, told BBC Radio London back in late April that TfL was asking the government to intervene, warning that it could run out of money to pay staff.\n\nThe government offered a bailout of up to \u00a31.9 billion in May with Transport Secretary Grant Shapps setting out the terms in a letter to Mr Khan.\n\nThese included TfL resuming normal services, which had been temporarily reduced and introducing some policies to manage demand and raise revenue including temporarily suspending free bus travel for over 60s during peak hours, suspending free travel across TfL services for under 18s and reintroducing the congestion charge.\n\nThe charge had been temporarily suspended in March to support key workers. The government\u2019s bailout condition called for the charge to be reintroduced and for the Mayor to \u201curgently bring forward proposals to widen the scope and levels of these charges.\u201d\n\nThe congestion charge was then raised from its pre-pandemic level of \u00a311.50 to \u00a315, and now operates for a longer time period and at weekends. TfL has said this is a temporary measure. There are additional reimbursements for vulnerable people and certain charity and local authority workers. NHS staff travelling for work were already exempt.\n\nOn Twitter, Mr Bailey has said the \u201cgovernment asked for proposals\u201d regarding the congestion charge but \u201cit was his choice to [increase the charge].\u201d\n\nWhile this is technically accurate, it is misleading for Mr Bailey to suggest, therefore, that TfL could have proposed a rise in the congestion charge, and then kept the fee as it was, while still receiving the government bailout under the terms set out.\n\nMr Bailey has also claimed that the Mayor\u2019s consultation on the increase ran for too short a period, or that there was no consultation. The consultation appeared to run for around five days between 1 June and 4 June.", "lang": "en"}
