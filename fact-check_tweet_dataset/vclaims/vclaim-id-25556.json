The text along with the post reads, \"A dark face of humanity. Indian forces burning a Kashmiri protester with fire in Srinagar.\"\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be false. The video is from Jhunjhunu district in Rajasthan where a man reportedly immolated himself to protest an anti-encroachment drive by forest officials in July this year.\n\nThe claim tweeted on Friday, was retweeted almost 2,000 times and liked by almost 1,600 users till the time of filing this story. The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\n'Khaleej Mag' is a digital media company based in Dubai, Kuwait, Qatar and Dublin. It has almost 20,000 followers on Twitter.\n\nThe post went viral on Facebook as well.\n\nWith the help of keywords, we found a news report by Times Now which carried the same video. As per reports, 40-year-old Baburao Saini had set himself on fire on July 7, 2019, when forest officials came to demolish his house which was allegedly built on forest land. Media outlet Patrika had also covered this incident.\n\nA report by Dainik Bhaskar says that Baburao Saini died on July 11 in a hospital in Jaipur.\n\nLast month, the same video was passed off with the claim that Dalits are being burnt alive under PM Narendra Modi's rule. At that time, Alt News had debunked this claim and found that the man in the video was not a Dalit.", "lang": "en"}
