Let\u2019s try to analyze the claims made in the post.\n\nClaim: On attempt to test 5G in the Netherlands 297 birds died due to high frequency. Fact: Over 300 birds died in Hague but the reason for their death was not a 5G frequency test. WBVR Laboratory in Lelystad and National History Museum have concluded that the cause of death was not due to harmful viruses or experiments conducted by humans. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched for the news on Google with the keywords \u201cBirds died in the Netherlands\u201d, it was found that the news regarding the deaths of birds went viral last year. Hundreds of birds died in Hague last year at Huijgenspark, close to Hollands Spoor station. While it is true that birds died, the reason for their deaths was not found. Many fact-checkers have written articles at that time debunking the hoax that the 5G experiment has caused the deaths. According to the Snopes article, the 5G experiment as a reason for birds\u2019 deaths was first posted by John Khules, an anti-5G activist. Later on, he posted saying that he was not serious when he said that 5G experiment was behind the deaths of birds. But, his initial comments went viral by then. In an additional investigation by Snopes, it was found that no 5G test was conducted in the surrounding areas on the day of the deaths.\n\nAccording to the latest information available on the internet, \u2018The Holland Times\u2019 published an article in February 2019 explaining the reason behind the mass deaths of starlings. According to the article, WBVR Laboratory in Lelystad and National History Museum have concluded, \u2018the starlings must have forcefully flown towards and collided with the ground in a sudden fit of panic, upon arrival or departure from their resting places, and these impacts were fatal.\u2019 They have eliminated any possibility of harmful viruses or human experiments as the reason behind the deaths of birds. The article concludes saying, \u2018the assumed cause of death is that the birds collided with deadly force with each other, with tree branches or with the ground due to being panicked and disoriented.\u201d\n\nTo sum it up, 297 birds did not die in the Netherlands due to a 5G test.\n\nDid you watch the first Episode of DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
