An office company called Staples, where I'm pleased to see the Obama campaign has been shopping.\n\n \n\n \"The Sports Authority, which of course became a favorite of my boys.\n\n \n\n \"We helped start an early childhood learning company called Bright Horizons that First Lady Michelle Obama rightly praised. \"And at a time when nobody thought we'd ever see a new steel mill built in America, we took a chance and build one in the cornfield in Indiana. Today, Steel Dynamics is one of the largest steel producers in the United States. These are American success stories.\"\n\nWhat did Michelle Obama say?\n\nLet\u2019s Move!\n\n \n\n We asked Romney\u2019s campaign, and did some searching of our own.\n\n \n\n The first lady didn\u2019t offer a blanket endorsement of Bright Horizons, a major provider of employer-sponsored child care that\u2019s been named one of Fortune magazine\u2019s \"100 Best Companies to Work for in America.\"\n\n \n\n Rather, she singled them out for a mention in a June 2011 speech in Washington, D.C., as a new partner for her healthy-kids initiative, Let\u2019s Move.\n\n \n\n Her comments were publicized a year later in a Daily Caller article headlined \"Michelle Obama praised Bain Capital-backed child care company,\" as well as by ABC News and Fox Business News with Neil Cavuto.\n\n \n\n She was \"singing the praises of a company called Bright Horizons last year\" saying it was \"it was beyond just first-rate,\" Cavuto said.\n\n \n\n The coverage focused on a YouTube video that showed the first lady mentioning Bright Horizons . She had visited a child care center \u2014 not one managed by Bright Horizons, but rather an unrelated center called CentroNia \u2014 to announce \"Let\u2019s Move Child Care.\" Providers such as Bright Horizons had agreed to sign on with Partnership for a Healthier America to focus on nutrition and exercise in their centers.\n\n \n\n Michelle Obama said:\n\nIn a related Bright Horizons news release, she was quoted as saying, \"If our kids get into the habit of getting up and playing, if their palates warm up to veggies at an early age, and if they\u2019re not glued to a TV screen all day, they\u2019re on their way to healthy habits for life. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so excited about Let\u2019s Move Child Care \u2013 because I know that childcare facilities and home-based providers can be a real building block for an entire generation of healthy kids.\"\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n Romney said the first lady \"praised\" Bright Horizons. She did say that she was \"excited\" to launch an initiative that included the child care provider, calling Let\u2019s Move partners \"so important.\" Those are favorable comments about the company.
