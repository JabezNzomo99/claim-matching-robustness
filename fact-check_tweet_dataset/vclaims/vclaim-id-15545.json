Ilhan Omar that called for white men to be \u201cput in chains as slaves because they will never submit to Islam.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence that Omar ever said this.\n\nOmar was elected to Congress in November to represent Minnesota\u2019s fifth congressional district. She is one of three Muslims currently serving in Congress.\n\nThe meme has been circulating for months, yet TheDCNF found no evidence Omar ever called for white men to be \u201cput in chains.\u201d\n\nOmar herself addressed the false quote on Twitter, writing in November, \u201cWho said facts mattered?\u201d\n\nShe did make the first statement quoted in the meme \u2013 \u201cI am America\u2019s hope and the president\u2019s nightmare\u201d \u2013 during a 2017 interview with comedian Trevor Noah on The Daily Show.\n\nThe image featured in the meme is from a September 2017 Time Magazine profile of Omar.\n\nOmar has faced calls to be removed from her position on the House Foreign Affairs Committee over comments she made that were condemned as anti-Semitic. She also faced a wave of criticism after a video surfaced of her characterizing the 9/11 terrorist attacks as \u201csome people did something.\u201d\n\nPrior to her election to Congress, Omar served one term in Minnesota\u2019s House of Representatives.\n\nHer office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
