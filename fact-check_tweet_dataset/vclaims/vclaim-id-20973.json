Here is the exact quote: \u201cMoscow\u2019s long-term goal is build\u00ading a military prepared to conduct the range of conflicts from local war through regional conflict to a strategic conflict that could result in massive nuclear exchange.\u201d\n\nLikewise, a recent analysis of Russia\u2019s military doctrine prepared for the European Parliament\u2019s Sub-Committee on Security and Defense states that the focus of Russia\u2019s military doctrine and strategy \u201chas shifted from the accumulation of seemingly unlimited military power to devising new concepts that integrate conventional, nuclear, and unconventional elements of military power in order to build a complex toolkit for facing various contingencies.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the DIA report itself emphasizes that Russia is actually seeking to increase its reliance on conventional capability and deterrence as part of its military doctrine and strategy, first and foremost by developing precision strike weaponry \u2013 a capability Russia still lacks.\n\n\u201cOne of Russia\u2019s biggest hurdles since the dis\u00adsolution of the former Soviet Union has been its need to rely heavily on its nuclear forces to deter aggression, resulting in its stated willing\u00adness for first-use of nuclear weapons,\u201d the DIA report states. \u201cRussia has been building its conventional force capabil\u00adity along with modernizing its nuclear forces to create a more balanced military. Moscow has stressed development of conventional precision-strike weapons, a critical gap in its inven\u00adtory.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper acknowledged as much in a piece it published on July 3. The article\u2019s author cited the above quote from the DIA report and stated that \u201cthe DIA, on the whole, provides an objective assessment of Moscow\u2019s growing military might.\u201d\n\nThe DIA report further underscores the importance Russia places on developing conventional forces as part of its deterrence posture: \u201cThe concepts of readiness, non-nuclear deter\u00adrence, and unacceptable damage are closely linked in Russian thinking; Russian military leaders judge that a highly ready non-nuclear force, able to inflict unacceptable damage on an aggressor\u2014including against its economy\u2014 at any moment, is its own deterrent.\u201d\n\nRussia, of course, is also modernizing its nuclear forces. But it is cognizant of the \u201cstrategic coupling\u201d of U.S. anti-missile defense and prompt global strike capabilities as well as the limited efficiency of nuclear weapons in deterring conventional threats \u2013 factors that undermine the rationale for nuclear-based deterrence.", "lang": "en"}
