And what group is Kloppenburg talking about?\n\nThe Democracy Campaign\u2019s web site includes an article in its Hijacking Campaign 2016 section that highlights spending by the Wisconsin Alliance for Reform, which it describes as a \"Madison-based conservative issue ad group formed late last year.\"\n\nThe group bought television time in the Madison, Green Bay, La Crosse, Eau Claire and Milwaukee markets for an ad that it said \"dubbed Bradley, who is one of the court's five conservative judges, an independent jurist who has earned the support of numerous members of the law enforcement community.\" The group also ran radio ads in support of Bradley.\n\nThe Democracy Campaign estimates the group\u2019s pre-primary spending as running between $750,000 and $1 million. More ads sponsored by the group that criticize Kloppenburg have begun to air as the April 5, 2016 general election approaches.\n\nKloppenburg said that a conservative group spent $100 million in ads supporting her opponent in the primary election. The claim was 100 times off-base.", "lang": "en"}
