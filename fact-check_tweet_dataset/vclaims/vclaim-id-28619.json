'The venue was constructed in 1988 and has never had a fire sprinkler system,\u2019 it said.\u201d\n\nNSW Opposition Leader Michael Daley accuses the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) Trust of removing fire sprinklers to aid the planned demolition of Allianz Stadium. March 6, 2019.\n\nNSW Labor leader Michael Daley opposes the state government\u2019s plan to knock down and rebuild Sydney\u2019s Allianz Stadium. Daley accused the stadium\u2019s board, the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) Trust, of aiding the demolition decision by ripping out the stadium\u2019s fire sprinklers \u201cunder the cover of darkness\u201d. The SCG Trust disputes the claim. [1]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined Mr Daley\u2019s claim to determine if the stadium had sprinklers that could have been removed.\n\nNSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced a plan on November 24, 2017 to demolish and rebuild Sydney\u2019s Allianz and ANZ stadiums. [2]\n\nAAP FactCheck has evidence dated October 14, 2016, and prior to the premier\u2019s stadium demolition announcement, showing Allianz stadium, which opened in January 1988, never had sprinklers. [3]\n\nThe SCG Trust, which operates Allianz Stadium, sent AAP Factcheck an extract of a commercial-in-confidence report which it said \u201cwas provided to the NSW Public Works Committee last year, and also provided as part of a (NSW Parliament) Standing Order 52 document capture\u201d. \u201cIt was titled 2016 Allianz Stadium Safety, Security and Compliance Audit and was prepared by MI Associates in association with individual discipline experts,\u201d the SCG Trust told AAP FactCheck.\n\nIn the report, section 5.2. Fire and Egress Background and Context states \u201cno sprinklers in the building\u201d. One of six \u201ckey findings\u201d stated: \u201cMost fire systems are absent, obsolete or compromised. For example there are no sprinklers in the building.\u201d\n\nUnder \u201cRecommendations\u201d the report by sport, arts and culture and tourism consultants MI Associates said, \u201cInstall automatic sprinkler system and external fire hydrant system. This will require an upgrade to the water infrastructure as the current water supply has insufficient pressure.\u201d The final recommendation is to \u201cprovide adequate fire protection measures and systems (including sprinklers, hydrants, detection and alarms) to protect those queuing during through or adjacent to high risk areas such as concessions\u201d. [4]\n\nAAP FactCheck found three other documents which show the stadium did not have sprinklers.\n\nIn a November 23, 2017 document on the stadium redevelopment, the SCG Trust said Allianz Stadium did not \u201chave any fire sprinklers\u201d as it complied with building codes dating back to the mid-1980s. \u201cThe building standards of the day mean that Allianz Stadium does not have any fire sprinklers.\u201d [5]\n\nIn June 2018, SCG Trust chief executive Jamie Barkley said there were no sprinklers in the stadium when questioned by a NSW Public Works Committee inquiry.\n\n\u201cIn the building code under which it was built they were not required, but you would not go into too many stadiums in the world now and not find a fire safety plan and also fire sprinklers,\u201d Mr Barkley told the inquiry. \u201cTo undertake the works necessary for the fire sprinklers is not about putting them in the ceiling ... Even if we had funding, and we had proceeded with it, it would have been an 18-month to two-year project.\u201d [6]\n\nIn September 2018, SCG Trust chairman Tony Shepherd said the case for the stadium\u2019s redevelopment grew from Britain\u2019s Hillsborough inquiry report into the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans. Following the 1990 report, changes were made to the guidelines in the UK\u2019s Green Guide, a government publication on spectator safety at sports grounds.\n\n\u201cThe SFS (Allianz Stadium) is deficient against every standard measure or discipline in the Green Guide when it comes to fire and life safety measures, including: no fire sprinklers,\u201d Mr Shepherd said. \u201cSadly, the Sydney Football Stadium (SFS/Allianz) was designed in the mid-1980s and opened in 1988, long before the Green Guide which grew from the Taylor report and became the global stadium design handbook.\u201d [7]\n\nMr Daley\u2019s office did not respond to AAP FactCheck when asked if the opposition leader stood by his claim about sprinklers being removed.\n\nAAP FactCheck concludes Mr Daley\u2019s claim that the SCG board ripped out stadium fire sprinklers under the cover of darkness is false because the stadium never had sprinklers.", "lang": "en"}
