Even if the latter were true, whether the cross was intentionally (or unintentionally) flipped upside down is unknown.\n\nAccording to the Church of Satan, an upside-down or inverted cross is not an official symbol of loyalty.\n\nBased on our examination of the videos in question, Melinda Gates did wear a necklace with a pendant in the shape of a cross in interviews.\n\nMelinda Gates has been a frequent target of misinformation campaigns during the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. So it was perhaps not surprising in May 2020 when her jewelry raised new suspicions among conspiracy theorists that she \u2014 the famous philanthropist and partner to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates \u2014 had sold her \u201csoul to the devil.\u201d\n\nIn at least three video segments with journalists that posted online between May 7 and May 11 (via Politico, Yahoo! Finance, and NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d), Gates criticized the U.S. federal government\u2019s response to the pandemic under U.S. President Donald Trump and discussed the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\u2019s work on finding a vaccine to build people\u2019s immunity against COVID-19 to end the crisis. On May 8, Gates tweeted:\n\nBut it did not appear to be Gates\u2019 comments in the video interviews that sparked controversy on social media. Rather, critics fixated on her appearance.\n\nShe was seen in a series of broadcast interviews wearing a pink blouse, hoop earrings, and a necklace \u2014 the latter of which conspiracy theorists believed to have displayed an upside-down or \u201cinverted\u201d cross that symbolized Gates\u2019 alleged allegiance to Satan and denouncement of the Christian faith. A viral Facebook post read:\n\nAnother popular post, which a YouTuber recited in a May 12 video, said:\n\nThe claim is two-pronged: that Gates did in fact wear an upside-down or inverted cross in video interviews, including for NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show, and that an inverted cross is a symbol of Satanic worship.\n\nWhile unpacking the former, keep in mind that Bill and Melinda Gates have been major targets of misinformation campaigns by anti-vaccine advocates and conspiracy theorists for more than 10 years, a result of their foundation\u2019s aggressive research to curb health disparities worldwide via vaccines, or shots that build populations\u2019 immunity against certain viruses.\n\nYet a new era of dubious claims involving the billionaire couple surfaced during the COVID-19 pandemic, ever since the coronavirus was first reported in humans in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. Doomsday theorists came up with the idea that the Gateses were trying to \u201cmicrochip\u201d or control world populations via a COVID-19 vaccine \u2014 a conspiracy theory that surfaced in various forms, including a doctored image that supposedly showed the words \u201cCenter for Global Human Population Reduction\u201d inscribed on a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation building.\n\nFor the jewelry claim, though, when asked by Snopes if Melinda Gates owned a necklace with an inverted cross, and if she was wearing it during the May 2020 interviews, representatives of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (which handles most media requests for the couple) did not respond to the inquiry as of this writing.\n\nUpon examination of the interview footage on the \u201cToday\u201d show website, for example, Gates was indeed wearing a necklace that appeared to have a charm in the shape of a cross and one of the cross\u2019 arms looked longer than the rest.\n\nBut here\u2019s what makes the answer to the claim murky: It\u2019s unclear whether the cross pendant itself had four equilateral arms, like a Greek cross or plus sign, or if it had one longer arm like the Latin cross.\n\nFor the former theory, it was possible the Greek cross included a rounded clasp to attach the pendant to the necklace chain and that clasp made one of the cross\u2019 vertical arms appear longer than it actually was. That was the case in low-resolution photos of Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of former U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, when conspiracy theorists online raised similar questions about her cross-shaped necklace in 2018. A spokesperson for Chelsea Clinton confirmed that she, indeed, sported a \u201cGreek Cross or an equilateral cross\u201d around her neck on \u201crare occasion.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Gates could be wearing a Latin cross, as critics claim. If that\u2019s the case, the next questions are these: Did she purposefully wear the cross upside down or did the charm flip unintentionally?\n\nBased on the available evidence, we cannot make that call. We can, however, provide context as to why wearing a cross pendant, even one inverted, may or may not be a statement of Gates\u2019 ideologies.\n\nIn several public statements, including a video interview with a reporter for The Guardian in 2012, Gates has identified as a follower of the Catholic Church. The reporter, for example, described Gates as a \u201cchurch-going, believing Catholic\u201d and Gates did not refute the claim.\n\nThat piece of her identity could be the reason for why she wore a necklace with a cross in 2020, or not. Nonetheless, according to Catholic Answers, which defines itself as a \u201cmedia ministry\u201d that explains and defends the Catholic faith, even if Gates\u2019 cross was upside-down, the piece of jewelry could still be a statement of her devotion to the church. Its website states:\n\nThat said, some people believe an upside-down cross is a statement against Jesus Christ, who is revered in Christianity, and in favor of Satan. For example, a 1993 document, titled \u201cSatanic Cult Awareness\u201d and sponsored by the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s National Institute of Justice, said an upside-down cross is \u201cblaspheme of the Christian cross\u201d and a symbol that law enforcement and criminal justice agencies should be aware of.\n\nOn page 40 of the document:\n\nBut many people who call themselves Satanists reject the inverted cross as an official symbol. According to the Church of Satan, which Encyclopaedia Britannica defines as \u201ccounterculture group founded in the United States in the 1960s,\u201d the group\u2019s main symbol is the Sigil of Baphomet, incorporating a pentagram, a goat\u2019s head, and Hebrew letters.\n\nAdditionally, for some people, the cross with one longer arm could have no meaning at all. In the words of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod:\n\nIn sum, given the fact that an upside-down or inverted cross could mean anything \u2014 including a dedication to St. Peter\u2019s crucifixion, not necessarily a symbol of allegiance to Satan and denouncement of Christianity \u2014 and the fact that Gates has publicly identified herself as a member of the Catholic Church, we rate this claim \u201cMostly False,\u201d with the caveat that she did wear a necklace with a cross-shaped pendant for interviews with journalists in 2020 and the position and exact shape of the cross is difficult to discern in available video footage.", "lang": "en"}
