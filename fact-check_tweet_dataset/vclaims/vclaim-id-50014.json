The claim is misleading; on July 1, 2020, the World Bank downgraded Sri Lanka to a \u201clower middle income country\u201d, whilst simultaneously downgrading Sudan to a \u201clow income country\u201d, which is the financial institution's lowest classification.\n\nThe misleading claim was published in this Sri Lankan blog post on July 4, 2020. Its title translates to English as: \u201cSri Lanka becomes equal to Sudan - downgraded from an Upper Middle income country\u201d.\n\nThe article\u2019s first three paragraphs translate to English as: \u201cAccording to the latest classification by the World Bank, Sri Lanka has been downgraded to a lower middle income country from its previous status as an upper middle income country. It should be particularly noted that this comes just an year after the World Bank classified Sri Lanka as an upper middle income country.\n\n\u201cThe classification by the World Bank has been done as per income levels of various countries for 2020-2021.\n\n\u201cSri Lanka is among the ten countries that were reclassified by the World Bank in comparison to the previous year.\u201d\n\nThe same claim was also shared in Facebook posts here, here, here, here, here and here.\n\nAccording to this World Bank blog post published on July 1, 2020, Sri Lanka\u2019s classification was downgraded from \u201cupper middle income\u201d to \u201clower middle income group\u201d. Meanwhile, Sudan\u2019s classification was downgraded from \u201clower middle income group\u201d to \u201clow income group\u201d.\n\nThe above table lists Sri Lanka\u2019s \u201cGross National Income\u201d in 2019 as 4,020 USD per capita, whilst Sudan\u2019s is 590 USD per capita.\n\nIn response to the misleading posts, senior financial journalist and analyst Asantha Sirimanne said the claim was \u201cinaccurate\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe statistics clearly show that Sri Lanka was moved to the lower middle income level, whereas Sudan, was reclassified into the low income level due to contractions in the GDP,\u201d he told AFP by phone on July 8, 2020. \u201cMoreover, Sudan experienced a steep currency fall which also contributed to the reclassification.\u201d\n\nA Ceylon Chamber of Commerce official also said it was inaccurate to state that Sri Lanka and Sudan were placed on an equal level off the recent World Bank reclassification of country income levels.\n\n\u201cThe data published in the World Bank blog clearly reflects the wide gap between the GNI of Sri Lanka and Sudan,\u201d the official noted in an email in response to a request from AFP.", "lang": "en"}
