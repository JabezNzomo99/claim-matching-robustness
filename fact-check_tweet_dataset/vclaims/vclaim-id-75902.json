A small majority wants to repeal it, but that is slowly receding as a rising majority says, \u2018No, fix it.\u2019 This is the tradition of good, old-fashioned American pragmatism.\"\n\nWe recently fact-checked Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., on the public\u2019s , which appears to have remained stable in recent months. And recent Kaiser Family Foundation polling shows that from March to April, the percentage of people who said they want improvements to the law jumped from 49 to 58.\n\nBut what about Clinton\u2019s claim that most Americans want to keep Affordable Care Act protections, even if they don\u2019t like the law itself? Clinton didn\u2019t return our request for comment, but we found her analysis to be on target.\n\nAccording to RealClearPolitics, a political news and commentary site that aggregates polls, an average of five polls found that expressed opposition to the health care law. That\u2019s a small majority, just as Clinton said. Other surveys record smaller percentages, in the 35 percent to 45 percent range.\n\nWhat about her argument that Americans like specific protections in the law, even as they oppose the law as a whole?\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s March 2014 report how voters feel about different components of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA majority of Republicans, Democrats and independents favored 7 of the 11 elements Kaiser asked about in March. They are:\n\u2022 Says 5-year-olds can \u201ctake hormones and change my sex.\u201d\n\u2022 Penalties for insurers who spend too little on medical care: 65 percent support\n\nOn an additional three elements of the law, a majority of Americans expressed support, but only a minority of Republicans:\n\u2022 An increase in the Medicare payroll tax for upper income earners: 60 percent\n\nSo on 10 of the 11 elements, substantial majorities of Americans expressed support, justifying Clinton\u2019s claim that \"a large majority of Americans\" support individual elements of the law.\n\nBut there was one exception: The individual mandate, one of the cornerstones of the law. It attracted the support of only 40 percent of Americans -- 55 percent of Democrats, 39 percent of independents and 21 percent of Republicans.\n\nClinton said, \"A small majority of Americans don\u2019t think they like the Affordable Care Act, but a large majority of Americans don\u2019t want to do away with the protections that are in the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nAn average of recent polls shows that just over 50 percent of Americans favor repealing the law. And a recent Kaiser study shows that \"large majorities\" of Americans favor 10 of the 11 elements of the law the pollsters asked about. However, Americans do oppose one crucial element of the law -- the individual mandate. That's something Clinton's comment glosses over, so we rate her claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
