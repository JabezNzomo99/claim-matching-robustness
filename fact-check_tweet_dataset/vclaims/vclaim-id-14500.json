But Federal Aviation Administration records show the aircraft, a small jet, is not \u201cregistered to the Center for Disease Control\u201d \u2014 but to the Georgia-based Phoenix Air Group.\n\nThe pilot of that flight, Randy Davis \u2014 who is also senior vice president and general counsel at Phoenix Air \u2014 told FactCheck.org in a phone interview that the trip was a routine military transport mission. He flew a serviceman from Marine Corps Air Station Miramar to Fort Benning.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of a government contract to move wounded warriors,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do this every day.\u201d\n\nPhoenix Air does also have the capability to transport individuals with infectious diseases \u2014 a service the company provided to the government during the Ebola outbreak in 2014.\n\nBut Davis said Phoenix Air does not have a current contract with the CDC. Also, he added, the photo used in the story \u2014 seen in a 2014 Washington Times story about the transportation of Ebola patients \u2014 shows one of Phoenix Air\u2019s large Gulfstream aircrafts, not the Learjet used in the flight last week.\n\nThe false story largely republished a portion of a post on a self-proclaimed \u201calt news\u201d website called rense.com. The post has all the makings of a conspiracy theory, telling, for example, of a \u201cclassified program\u201d in which the \u201cgovernment has been flying in dangerously ill illegals into the US for s (sic) long time\u2026most especially from Africa.\u201d\n\nThe Right of the Right story garnered thousands of shares on Facebook.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cCDC Caught Flying Diseased Caravan Migrants Into U.S. for Medical Treatment.\u201d Right of the Right. 28 Nov 2018.\n\nHaynes, Benjamin.
