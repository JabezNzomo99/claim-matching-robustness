Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine, alleging they \u201cvoted NOT to send stimulus checks.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed into law on March 27 a $2.2 trillion dollar stimulus package aimed at softening the economic blow of the coronavirus pandemic. That economic stimulus package included $300 billion in direct payments to American taxpayers.\n\nHowever, the post\u2019s claim is inaccurate. The bill passed unanimously in the Senate on March 25, The New York Times reported. Whoever created the meme likely mistook one of the earlier procedural votes on the stimulus package as the final vote.\n\nIn the days before the final vote, the Senate was roughly divided along party lines over some appropriations in the bill. Among the sticking points were oversight on the $500 billion earmarked for distressed corporations, worker protections and unemployment insurance, per CNBC. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer described the $500 billion fund as a \u201cgiant corporate bailout fund with no accountability \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t even know what loans were made until six months later,\u201d according to Vox.\n\nIn a 47-47 cloture vote on March 22, the Senate failed to get the 60 votes necessary to move the bill forward, with all 45 of the Senate Democrats voting against the motion. The same motion failed again in a 49-46 vote the following day.

Two days later, it passed in the House, before being signed into law.\n\nMillions of Americans have since received $1,200 payments from the federal government as part of the stimulus package, according to The Washington Post.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
