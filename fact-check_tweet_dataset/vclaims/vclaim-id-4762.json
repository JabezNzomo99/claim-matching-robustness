It was for this movie that Chopra had donned a burqa. The photograph dates back to 2010. It was uploaded by Outlook on its website.\n\nPosted below is a YouTube video of an extract from the movie in which Priyanka Chopra can be seen wearing the same burqa.\n\nThere is yet another occasion where Chopra wore a burqa. This was tweeted by her in October 2015 and was part of the promotional campaign for Quantico.\n\nThe Facebook page \u2018Yogi Adityanath ki Sena\u2018 which shared the misleading image of Priyanka Chopra is notorious for spreading mis/disinformation in form of fake or misleading quotes, images and videos. Some of the instances documented by Alt News include fake quotes attributed to Jyotiraditya Scidia, Ravish Kumar, Rana Ayyub and Nana Patekar.\n\nActress Priyanka Chopra has been at the receiving end of right-wing trolling on social media in recent times. Recently, a controversial episode of the American television series Quantico which showed a Hindu extremist as part of a terror plot on New York had attracted much criticism and ridicule, coming shortly on the heels of her visit to the Rohingya refugee camp. Now, the actress is once again in the crosshairs and continues to be targeted relentlessly.", "lang": "en"}
