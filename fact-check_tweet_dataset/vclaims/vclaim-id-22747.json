The page makes fun of conservative attitudes that might, for example, associate drug use with \u201csatanism\u201d. (Dagga is a South African word for marijuana.)\n\nThe page has been online since 2014 and has more than 30,000 followers.\n\n: \u201cRecent Christian studies prove beyond any doubt that marshmallow Easter eggs are a satanistic plot to infest South African children with the demons of paganry and witchcraft.\u201d\n\n, which sent an alert to Africa Check for us to determine whether it is\n\nSatire is neither true nor false.\n\nIt\u2019s clearly absurd to claim that marshmallow eggs \u2013 a\n\nover the Easter holidays \u2013 are really \u201cdemon embryos\u201d.\n\nIs the claim true?

The joke was so popular it\n\not to show children that they\n\ncan become a \"powerful evil force, and they don't have to listen to their parents\u201d.\n\nThen there\u2019s its warning that the\n\nin Gauteng province are \u201cMasonic Malls\u201d built on ancient\n\nin the shape of a pentagram to \u201cinflict uncontrollable desire and lust\u201d on residents and visitors to the area.\n\n, asking if they could email us an explanation of their satire to help Facebook users tell the difference between satire and false news.\n\nBut they stayed in character.\n\n\u201cYou can email Jesus because, Jesus does not think it\u2019s false! #prayforafricacheck.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
