Their internal organs \u2013 the heart, liver, pancreas, kidneys and lungs \u2013 are\n\ninto people who need the organs to stay alive.\n\nIn this way a single person can\n\nof seven other people, according to South Africa\u2019s\n\nThe organs are only harvested when the donor\u2019s\n\n, even if some of their body\u2019s functions are kept going by life support.\n\n\u201cA patient cannot recover from brain death,\u201d says\n\n, a guide for patients and their families produced by\n\nin the US.\n\nBut how do doctors know that someone is really dead?\n\nBrain death happens in two ways.\n\nOne is when no blood or oxygen can reach the brain, because the heart and lungs have stopped working. \u201cWithout oxygen or blood, the brain dies,\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other is when the entire brain has stopped working.\u201d\n\nTwo doctors have to perform detailed tests before a person can be declared brain dead,\n\n. These doctors are completely independent of the doctors who will harvest and transplant the organs.\n\n\u201cThe criteria for brain death are very strictly adhered to and accepted medically, legally and ethically in South Africa and internationally,\u201d\n\nThe meme has been circulating on Facebook for at least four years.\n\nSnopes found that organ donors are always dead, whether the death was caused by the failure of the heart or the brain. \u201cNo living patients are ever subjected to organ harvesting,\u201d\n\nan unnamed US bioethicist about the claim. The expert said organ donors \u201chave to be determined to be dead before organs can be removed, meaning that they have either had their heart stop permanently or been determined to be brain dead\u201d.\n\nThis was \u201cunder law\u201d, the bioethicist said. Laws in\n\nall stipulate that organ donors must be declared dead by doctors before their internal organs can be harvested and donated to the patients who need them.\n\n. \u201cThey are in a state of irreversible coma, will never regain consciousness or have a meaningful recovery, and cannot experience pain.\u201d\n\nThe expert added: \u201cThere has never been a person who was accurately determined to be brain dead who regained consciousness or recovered.\u201d\n\nBut what about the black market?\n\nThe false meme only talks about \u201corgan donors\u201d. Donors are people who choose, when they are alive, to donate their organs after their death, to help other people stay alive.\n\nBut what about the unlawful harvesting and sale of organs?\n\nCenter for Organ Recovery and Education in the US .\n\npretty much everywhere in the world \u2013 including in\n\nSecond, harvesting and transplanting organs is a complex and specialised procedure \u2013 far more complicated than an illegal enterprise could achieve without\n\nOrgan transplantation requires \u201cinvolvement from highly trained medical professionals, the process of matching donors with recipients, the need for modern medical facilities, and the support required for transplantation\u201d,\n\nBut there are reports of an illegal or hidden trade in organs \u2013 known as\n\n. Some reports say organs necessary for life \u2013 the heart, liver, pancreas and lungs \u2013 are taken,\n\n, in which people living in poverty\n\nto prolong the lives of wealthy patients. We have two kidneys. We can\n\n, but only at a serious\n\nThese are distressing reports and outside the scope of this check.\n\nBut the fact remains that ordinary organ donors, people who\n\ntheir organs after they die, are not alive when their organs are used to\n\nof up to seven other people.", "lang": "en"}
