He\u2019s called him a disappointment.\" For emphasis, she later repeated the charge that Sanders had used the words \"weak\" and \"disappointment.\"\n\nBut did he? We found lots of examples of Sanders prodding Obama to take a more aggressively liberal approach to governing, and we have previously found some truth to the charge that Sanders had tried to find someone to challenge Obama in a primary when he was running for a second term in 2012.\n\nBut the specific charge Clinton made -- that Sanders used the words \"weak\" and \"disappointment\" -- were at best exaggerated.\n\nWe found two examples when Sanders used one or both of those words, both of which are murkier than Clinton lets on.\n\nOne is an interview Sanders gave broadcaster Thom Hartmann on July 22, 2011. Sanders lamented that Obama, in his view, had moved too far to the right politically. But while Sanders used the words Clinton cited, he didn\u2019t say that he himself felt that way.\n\nSpecifically, Sanders said, \"I think there are millions of Americans who are deeply disappointed in the president, who believe that with regard to Social Security and a number of other issues, he said one thing as a candidate and is doing something very much else as a president, who cannot believe how weak he has been \u2014 for whatever reason \u2014 in negotiating with Republicans. And there\u2019s deep disappointment.\"\n\nNote Sanders\u2019 language: He says \"millions of Americans\" feel that way, not that he did so himself. It\u2019s a small difference, but we think a significant one given the forcefulness of Clinton\u2019s attack line.\n\nThe other example we found came on Nov. 13, 2011, when Politico reported that Sanders would not say whether he would support Obama for re-election (though he ultimately did).\n\nThe Politico article quoted Sanders saying that Obama should \"stop reaching negotiated agreements with Republicans that are extremely weak and disadvantageous to ordinary people. ... I certainly hope and expect to be supporting the president, but it\u2019s a little bit early in the process.\"\n\nHere, Sanders said Obama had reached weak agreements with his political adversaries, not that Obama himself was personally weak. Once again, this is more nuanced than Clinton\u2019s assertion made it out to be.\n\nWe should note that Sanders has used other words to distance himself from Obama\u2019s policies and approach to governing.\n\nFor instance, in July 2015, Sanders told Jim Tankersley, a writer for the Washington Post\u2019s Wonkblog, \"In many respects, the president was not strong enough on many issues. For example, he\u2019s wrong on the trade issue, dead wrong. Also, the president made a mistake, that after his brilliant campaign of 2008, he essentially said to his most motivated supporters, thanks very much for electing me, but I\u2019ll go from here on my own. I\u2019ll sit down and negotiate with Boehner and Mitch McConnell, and I really don\u2019t need you anymore. Terrible mistake. Because the only way forward, to bring forth a progressive agenda, is to have the American people mobilized.\"\n\nThis is certainly a critical assessment of Obama\u2019s tenure, but it doesn\u2019t include the words \"weak\" or \"disappointment.\"\n\nClinton said Sanders has called Obama \"weak. He's called him a disappointment.\"\n\nSanders has critiqued Obama and used those words to describe the feelings of Americans, or to describe Obama\u2019s policies. But Sanders did not specifically call Obama \"weak\" and \"a disappointment.\"", "lang": "en"}
