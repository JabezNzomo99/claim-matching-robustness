What we need is more Jesus care.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe the if [sic] we can just get more of these people with pre-existing health conditions back into the churches you would see a lot of healings and many of these problems would just go away. People who lead Godly lives don\u2019t worry about Doctors. We have The Lord to take care of us,\u201d the quote continues.\n\nThere is no evidence that Pence ever said this.\n\nThis meme attempts to criticize both Pence\u2019s Christian faith and his stance on health care. Pence has called Obamacare \u2013 which bars insurance companies from denying people coverage based on pre-existing conditions \u2013 a failure and \u201ca burden on the American people,\u201d something that has ruffled the feathers of the health care law\u2019s supporters.\n\nHowever, The Daily Caller found no evidence that Pence, who has long been followed by the media, ever said this. The fake quote has been attributed to him since May 2017, when Republicans were attempting to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nA logo that reads \u201cFox News The FB Page\u201d appears in the meme, yet the quote was not posted on any of Fox News Channel\u2019s social media accounts. The page is no longer available on Facebook, but according to Truth or Fiction, it regularly shared misinformation and was not associated with Fox News in any way.", "lang": "en"}
