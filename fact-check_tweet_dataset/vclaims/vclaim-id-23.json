What we need is more Jesus care. I believe if we can just get more of these people with pre-existing health conditions back into the churches you would see a lot of healings and many of these problems would just go away. People who lead Godly lives don\u2019t worry about Doctors. We have The Lord to take care of us.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump recently put Pence in charge of the U.S. response to the coronavirus outbreak, as reported by Reuters here New York Times also reported here that Pence will oversee all coronavirus messaging from government health officials and scientists.\n\nThe Washington Post reported here that Trump\u2019s appointment of Pence has met scrutiny from Democrats who question Pence's preparedness. The most prominent example of this criticism is that, while responding to an HIV outbreak as governor of Indiana, Pence delayed the establishment of a temporary needle-exchange program, here. This was because \u201che was morally opposed to needle exchanges on the grounds that they supported drug abuse,\" the New York Times reported here.\n\nThere is no record that Pence ever made the remarks attributed to him in the Facebook image.\n\nThe pixelated logo at the bottom of the image resembles the Fox News logo, but says \u201cFox News, the FB Page\u201d. \"Fox News, the FB Page\" does not appear in any Facebook search. The image\u2019s text is also oddly formatted and presents evidence of additional edits, including low quality and a font different from the text font of the original image. The original image that likely inspired this claim was posted by the verified Fox News Twitter account on December 19, 2016, visible here. In the image, Pence tweets a message of congratulations to a recently elected Trump.\n\nFalse: Mike Pence did not say that the American people needed less healthcare, and instead needed more \u201cJesus care\u201d", "lang": "en"}
