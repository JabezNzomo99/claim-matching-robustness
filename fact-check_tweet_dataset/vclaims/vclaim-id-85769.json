(It was absorbed by a neighboring village after the loss of its main customer for water.) But the story is not as simple as Baldwin suggests, according to public records and interviews. The Fact Checker obviously takes no position on the merits of the bill or whether activist investors are a harm to the economy.\n\nStarboard Value LP is an activist hedge fund based in New York, focusing on identifying undervalued companies and pushing management to make changes that would enhance shareholder value. Often, that could mean selling or closing lines of businesses. Starboard has been especially successful at using a relatively small stake in a company to convince other, less aggressive shareholders to follow its advice and oust boards that oppose its strategy.\n\nIn 2011, Wausau Paper was struggling because demand for fine-quality paper had declined sharply as Americans relied more on computers to transmit messages and documents. In 2007, 2008 and 2009, the company closed paper mills in New Hampshire and Maine and another facility in Wisconsin in response to market pressures, eliminating a total of 489 jobs. The company\u2019s bathroom tissue business, by contrast, was booming \u2014 and presumably would still thrive in the digital era.\n\nStarting in May of 2011, Starboard began acquiring shares in the company, and on July 28 revealed it had taken a 6.9 percent stake. In a letter to company executives, it echoed the point made earlier by Deutsche Bank, saying the company was \u201cundervalued\u201d primarily because of the paper business. \u201cDespite the continued underperformance of Wausau\u2019s Paper business, we believe the business has considerable value,\u201d the letter noted, suggesting its specialty paper brands might \u201cgarner higher multiples.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 3, Starboard said it had 7.5 percent of the company stock and urged a sale of the paper business, as well as timberlands and hydroelectric assets, to become a \u201cpure play\u201d tissue business. The letter noted that the company had already spent $151 million restructuring the paper business in recent years, and \u201cwe have serious doubts that the recently announced headcount reductions in your Brokaw facility will be enough to turn this segment around.\u201d\n\nBut Starboard did not have control of the company, let alone even a board seat. The company would gain board seats long after the Brokaw mill was shut down. When the Brokaw decision was made, Starboard did not have a voice in the boardroom \u2014 a point made at the time by Wausau Paper. Indeed, the company even said it had been thinking of dumping the paper business before Starboard started buying shares.\n\nHank Newell, who was transitioning to become chief executive at the time of plant closure, has argued that Starboard\u2019s aggressive criticism of the company helped undermine the prospects for saving the mill. \u201cDid they have control of the mill? Absolutely not. Did they direct the actions of the company? Absolutely not,\u201d he told The Fact Checker. \u201cDid they create the conditions that led to the closure of the mill? Yes.\u201d\n\nBut other former company executives tell a different story. A member of the leadership team, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue in Wisconsin but was no fan of Starboard, said there were companies potentially interested but no purported offer had been subject to due diligence; that would have revealed how old the plant equipment was. Eventually one of the potential bidders, Neenah Paper, ended up just purchasing Wausau\u2019s brand names for use in its own mills.\n\nThe Brokaw mill specialized in making fine paper, especially colored paper. But the company had not invested enough in new technology. \u201cThe machines were very costly to run compared to other machines to make that paper,\u201d said Perry Grueber, who had been Wausau\u2019s head of investor relations at the time. \u201cThe market for these products was too competitive and our costs were too high.\u201d\n\nBut contrary to statements the senator makes to the camera, Starboard did not control the company at the time and was not part of the executive decision-making to close the factory. We can find no Starboard statements calling for the closure of the factory \u2014 and company statements at the time said it had no role. One former executive claims the hedge fund\u2019s activities undermined the value of the assets, leading to the closure of the plant, but other company executives disagree.", "lang": "en"}
