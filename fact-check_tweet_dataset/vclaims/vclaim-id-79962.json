(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nSo did Obama say this? No, not exactly.\n\nObama did not literally say (or write) that the \"American dream is to be Donald Trump,\" but he did refer to Trump in a Harvard paper as an example of American success. The tone, however, wasn\u2019t entirely positive.\n\nIn April 1991, just before Obama was about to graduate from Harvard Law School, he and schoolmate Robert Fisher co-authored a paper called \"Race and Rights Rhetoric.\"\n\nAn excerpt from the unpublished paper was unearthed in the 2017 Obama biography \"Rising Star: The Making of Barack Obama\" by David Garrow:\n\nHere is the book\u2019s excerpt. For purposes of this fact-check, we have bolded portions of the quote:\n\n\"(Americans have) a continuing normative commitment to the ideals of individual freedom and mobility, values that extend far beyond the issue of race in the American mind. The depth of this commitment may be summarily dismissed as the unfounded optimism of the average American\u2014I may not be Donald Trump now, but just you wait; if I don't make it, my children will.\n\n(But) those of us on the political left (often forget) the degree to which coalition and consensus-building among the American electorate has necessarily precede any major federal program to reform or restructure America\u2019s economic and political landscape.\"\n\nAccording to Garrow (on page 451 in his book), the paper raises the argument that discussing minority rights as if they are \"universal\" rights may be counterproductive and that a pragmatic shift toward the \"language of opportunity\" would serve African-Americans better.\n\nGarrow writes, and quotes the Harvard paper (direct quotes from Obama\u2019s paper are bolded again for our purposes):\n\n\"\u2018This chapter evaluates the utility of rights rhetoric \u2026 as a vehicle for black liberation,\u2019 because the authors believed that such a focus \u2018has impeded, rather than facilitated\u2019 the achievement of \u2018black empowerment.\u2019 They observed that \u2018it has become increasingly apparent that the strategies rooted in the Sixties have not led blacks to the promised land of genuine political, economic and social equality,\u2019 because once that decade was in the past, \u2018political mobilization \u2026 ground to a halt as blacks became increasingly reliant on lawyers and professional civil rights leaders and organizations with only minimal institutional presence in local communities.\u2019\n\nGarrow explains that the two friends had written a pragmatic call that realism should trump idealism, and that Fisher recalled how he and Obama had each \"intensely edited all parts of the documents, (for it) was very much a product of both our minds.\"\n\nAfter Gallow\u2019s book was released, news outlets picked up on the Trump passage, and while most clarified the context of the words and provided the full excerpt in the body of the articles, the headlines of those stories remain misleading.\n\nA Facebook post claims in 1991 Obama said that \"the American dream is to be Donald Trump.\"\n\nObama did mention Trump in a Harvard paper that he co-wrote with a friend. But the passage says \"I may not be Donald Trump now, but just you wait; if I don't make it, my children will,\" referring to Trump as an example of Americans\u2019 expectations that they will be financially secure in the future.\n\nSo, yes Obama did refer to Trump as a financially stable person, but he never said or wrote the words that are being attributed to him on social media.\n\nThe quote is inaccurate, exaggerated and taken out of context. We rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
