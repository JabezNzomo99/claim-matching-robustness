The journalists waiting at the press conference were in for a rude shock when at 11.08 am the BJP IT cell head, Amit Malviya, tweeted the dates of the Karnataka elections even before the Chief Election Commissioner O.P. Rawat made the announcement at 11.23 am.\n\nIt turned out that Malviya was not alone in tweeting the dates. Srivatsa, Karnataka Congress Social Media in-charge, had also tweeted the same at the same time as Malviya. His tweet however didn\u2019t get as much attention as Malviya\u2019s. Both tweets were later deleted.\n\nMalviya\u2019s tweet led to a major outrage on social media with users questioning the objectivity of the Election Commission and the sanctity of the election process. When asked, how he got access to the dates before the EC announced them, Malviya claimed that it was on Times Now.\n\nSrivatsa also claimed that he got the information by watching local and national media channels.\n\nAlt News accessed the live TV program using JIO APP and Yupp TV and discovered that Times Now had indeed made the announcement before Amit Malviya. It was 11:06/11:07 am when Times Now announced the election dates on air. \u201cBREAKING: First on Times Now,\u201d the claim tweeted later by Times Now was indeed true.\n\nThe following video shows the Times Now Broadcast in that period.\n\nTimes Now had tweeted at 11.14 am, a few minutes after Malviya but still before the EC announcement. Times now subsequently deleted this tweet.\n\nThe leak of the information was not limited to Times Now alone. Kannada channels TV9 Karnataka, BTV, TV5 Kannada and Suvarna News also aired the dates around the same time.\n\nChief Election Commissioner expressed shock when informed about the journalists at the press conference that the BJP IT cell head had already tweeted the dates. He assured that the leak will be investigated and befitting legal and administrative actions will be taken.\n\nA leak of this nature seriously compromises the sanctity of the election process. We hope the Election Commission will get to the bottom of this and take action against the culprits.", "lang": "en"}
