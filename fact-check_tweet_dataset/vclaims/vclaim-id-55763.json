Those comments came between Jan. 25 and Feb. 8.\n\nOn Jan. 16, CNN reported that \"fears are mounting across Asia over the cross-border spread of a new coronavirus identified in China that has killed one patient and sickened dozens, as health authorities race to identify the source of the pathogen.\n\nA headline in the New York Times Jan. 18 read \"Deadly Mystery Virus Reported in 2 New Chinese Cities and South Korea.\"\n\nNBC said Jan. 20, \"Coronavirus cases surge in China as virus spreads.\"\n\nMeanwhile, as PolitiFact\u2019s timeline notes, when asked Jan. 22 if there were worries about a pandemic, Trump said \"No. Not at all. And we have it totally under control. It\u2019s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It\u2019s \u2014 going to be just fine.\"\n\nThe liberal media monitoring group Media Matters noted that the sequence of experts in the Trump video largely mirrors those used by Fox News host Sean Hannity in his March 26 program.\n\nThe video included a timeline that started in early January and picked up in mid March. It highlighted Trump\u2019s Jan. 30 travel restriction for China, and his March 13 declaration of a national emergency.\n\nBut there was only one highlight for February: \"Feb. 6 CDC ships first testing kits.\"\n\nTo mark that event is to overlook that those test kits proved to be a failure. Some of the chemicals in them were tainted, and states had to send their samples to be tested back to the CDC. Trump later said \"we inherited a broken test,\" but that was impossible because until the virus came into being, there could be no test. Point being, there was nothing to inherit.\n\nThe lack of widespread testing hamstrung the nation\u2019s response to COVID-19.\n\nThe lack of any other entries for February underscores the lack of action and brushes past Trump\u2019s words during that month. On Feb. 14, he said, \"We have a very small number of people in the country, right now, with it. It\u2019s like around 12. Many of them are getting better. Some are fully recovered already. So we\u2019re in very good shape.\"\n\nOn Feb. 24, Trump tweeted, \"The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA.\"\n\nRELATED: Timeline: How Donald Trump responded to the coronavirus pandemic\n\nSelective quoting of the New York Times\n\nOne full segment is built around New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman talking about Trump\u2019s travel restrictions on China.\n\nIn the video, there\u2019s audio of Haberman saying, \"At the end of the day, it was probably effective, because it did actually take a pretty aggressive measure against the spread of the virus.\"\n\nBut in the actual interview on The Daily podcast, Haberman immediately went on to say, \"The problem is, it was one of the last things that he did for several weeks.\"\n\nThe video\u2019s final section focuses on governors, both Democratic and Republican, thanking Trump and describing how much he\u2019s done for their states.\n\nIn the video, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo thanks Trump, saying \"His team is on it. They\u2019ve been responsive. Late at night, early in the morning.\"\n\nBut when Trump floated the idea of a travel quarantine around New York City, Cuomo said it would amount to a \"federal declaration of war on states.\"\n\nThe video shows Republican Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan praising Trump for \"doing a really good job of communicating with all the governors.\" It leaves out that Hogan disputed Trump\u2019s assertion that states have enough testing kits.\n\nAnd Hogan also joined Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in an op-ed calling on Washington to force private companies to produce essential products such as protective gear and coordinate purchasing to keep prices down.\n\nWhitmer and Trump had their own dust up. When she complained about tests and supplies, Trump referred to her as \"Gretchen Half Whitmer\" on Twitter.\n\nWhitmer tweeted,\"I've asked repeatedly and respectfully for help. We need it. No more political attacks, just PPEs, ventilators, N95 masks, test kits. You said you stand with Michigan \u2014 prove it.\"", "lang": "en"}
