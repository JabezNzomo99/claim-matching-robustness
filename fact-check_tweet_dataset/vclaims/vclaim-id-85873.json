It originally had a Pinocchio rating but that has now been removed in the wake of the publication of The Washington Post-Kaiser Foundation nationwide survey that confirmed the 1 in 5 statistic. The original issue with the statistic was that it was based just on a sample of two universities but was being treated as a nationwide sample. But that concern no longer exists now that a nationwide poll of college-age women has achieved the same result.\n\nIn other words, information that is localized to the seniors at two colleges has now been extrapolated by politicians to the universe of college experience. (The report itself states that the data are limited just to those universities.) And to some extent, the results depend on how questions are phrased and answers interpreted. Below we have embedded the key questions that led to the statistic cited by the White House.\n\nOn its Web site, the National Institute of Justice notes that rapes and other forms of sexual assault are among the most underreported crimes, but that \u201cresearchers have been unable to determine the precise incidence of sexual assault on American campuses because the incidence found depends on how the questions are worded and the context of the survey.\u201d It said that two parallel surveys of American college women were conducted in 1997 and came up with very different results, with one survey showing rapes were 11 times higher than the percentage in the other survey. The reason appears to be because of how the questions were worded. (Hat tip to Washington Post polling analyst Scott Clement for pointing us to this page.)\n\nStill, the report did indicate interesting trends over time, including the fact that sexual assault on campus had been declining in recent years\u2013and that the incidence of sexual assault was higher for women who were not in college. The report also offered a useful guide to the differences between various studies of sexual assault on campus, including this caveat about using the Campus Sexual Assault Study: \u201cBecause of the limited population included in the CSA, it should not be assumed that findings from the survey are representative of the population of persons ages 18 to 24 or even to college students specifically.\u201d\n\nGiven that an arm of the Justice Department now has provided this warning about the one in five statistic, The Fact Checker asked the White House to explain why the president and the vice president expressed the data in such sweeping terms. Recall that Biden had said, \u201cWe know the numbers: one in five of every one of those young women who is dropped off for that first day of school, before they finish school, will be assaulted, will be assaulted in her college years.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the MIT sample was based on self-selected responses, so its data could not be used as any sort of confirmation. The university itself warned that the numbers were not representative of all women at MIT: \u201cBecause the survey was not a random sample and was voluntary\u2026it would be a mistake to use these numbers to generalize about the prevalence of unwanted sexual behavior in the lives of all MIT students.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
