That's not exactly true: the word \"lynched\" invokes visions of white hoods, burning crosses and an angry mob stringing up people. In reality the two men were killed by one person during a botched firearms sale.\n\nAn article published on May 2, 2018 by NewsOne went viral with the headline \"Two Young Black Men Lynched In Oklahoma By Four Whites And It's Getting No Media Attention\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nWhen people talk about modern lynchings, R. Kelly and Bill Cosby are not legitimate examples. Ramon Smith and Jarron Moreland, both 21, are two men who were lynched in 2018. On April 18, police found the dismembered bodies of the young men in a pond outside of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Three white men and one white woman have been arrested for the crime. According to WJLA.com, \"Police arrested 22-year-old Kevin Garcia-Boettler, 43-year-old Johnny Shane Barker and the 16-year-old brother of Garcia-Boettler, who police say is the suspected shooter. Their mother, Crystal Rachelle Boettler, 40, has also been charged with accessory after the fact.\" According to court records, \"on April 14, Garcia-Boettler drove his brother to meet the two victims because he believed his brother was going to purchase a gun from Moreland. The sale was arranged through Craigslist and the two parties agreed to meet in a nearby grocery store parking lot. Garcia-Boettler told police that Moreland got out of a sedan and into the back seat of his van. He claims that he heard a gun \"rack\" and told police he witnessed his brother open fire killing the two men.\"\n\nLynching is usually defined as:\n\nA man killing two other men during a meeting to purchase a gun does not seem to fit that definition. Note that the original news report only speaks of one shooter, the others helped dispose of the bodies by cutting them to pieces and throwing them in a pond. Those are horrible things to do but that doesn't make it a \"lynching\".\n\nThe confusion about whether it was a \"lynching\" likely stems from the original news report quoted by NewsOne:\n\nThat article had following sentence in it:\n\nJust calling Shaun King a journalist leaves out some crucial bits of info:\n\nIn that context it is easy to see that the tweet being referenced is not taking a neutral point of view:\n\nThat tweet doesn't accurately describe what happened according to the police report. There was no abduction and the charges for the arrested men read:\n\nSo, only one killer and the others helped move/cut/dispose the bodies. Terrible people, terrible crime, but no lynching.", "lang": "en"}
