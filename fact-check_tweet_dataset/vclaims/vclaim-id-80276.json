Official census data from 2010 shows that less than 10 percent of Indonesia's population is Christian. The country\u2019s religious affairs ministry said even active proselytising since then would not have expanded the number of Christians in the country that rapidly. The Indonesian Church Association said there was no evidence that 30 percent of the population was Christian.\n\nThe video was posted by the Christian Facebook group \u201cTruly Blessed Daily\u201d and contains a three minute video which is from a Christian Broadcasting Network news programme on Christianity in Indonesia.\n\nIndonesia is the world\u2019s most populous Muslim country.\n\nThe narrator says: \"Churches here say 30 percent of this Muslim country is now Christians,\" referring to Indonesia.\n\nThe video has been watched more than 4 million times and has more than 127,000 shares and 106,000 reactions, according to Facebook data.\n\nIt features banners saying: \"THOUSANDS OF MUSLIMS AND BUDDHISTS TURN TO JESUS\" and \"REVIVAL IS HAPPENING IN INDONESIA\".\n\nChristians in Indonesia make up less than 10 percent of the country\u2019s population, according to the most recent census data.\n\nThe most recent census carried out by Indonesia's statistics agency -- or BPS -- in 2010 shows that 6.96 percent and 2.91 percent of Indonesians were, respectively Protestants and Catholics.\n\nOf Indonesia\u2019s 237 million total population, 87.18 percent was Muslim, the census found.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s religious affairs ministry\u2019s research and development head Abdurrahman Mas\u2019ud told AFP that the 2010 census data was still reliable.\n\n\u201cEven if there is an aggressive dynamics of spread of any religion, it won\u2019t change the BPS figure,\u201d said Mas\u2019ud, referring to the census data.\n\nBeril Huliselan, head of the research division at the Indonesian Church Association, known as PGI, told AFP that there was no data to support the claim that 30 percent of Indonesians were Christian.\n\n\u201cThe 30 percent claim does not have valid data,\u201d said Huliselan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to obtain the nationwide data on Christians in Indonesia because of the weak database from churches,\" he told AFP.", "lang": "en"}
