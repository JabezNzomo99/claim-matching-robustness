Let\u2019s try to check the veracity of the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Swiss Bank has revealed that there are 34 lakh crore rupees in the account of the present Congress President. Fact: Swiss Bank hasn\u2019t made any such revelation that the present Congress President Sonia Gandhi has stashed 34 lakh crore rupees with them. Nothing substantial was found to support the claim. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nSonia Gandhi is the current President of the Congress party. When googled to check if the Swiss bank has made any revelation about Sonia Gandhi stashing money with them, no results with relevant information were obtained.\n\nIf the Swiss bank has really made such revelation, they would have been reported by all the major newspapers and channels in India. But no news agency has reported anything about Swiss bank revealing about Sonia Gandhi stashing money with them. So, the news circulating on social media is baseless.\n\nTo conclude, the Swiss Bank hasn\u2019t said that the Congress President has stashed 34 lakh crore rupees with them.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
