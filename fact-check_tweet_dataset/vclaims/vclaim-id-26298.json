But that was a figure provided by the secretary of defense and a top official in the State Department.\n\nO\u2019Brien, who was tapped by President Donald Trump as his new national security adviser in mid-September, made the comment on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Oct. 27.\n\nHost Chuck Todd asked about the \u201csupposedly at least 100, ISIS fighters that escaped\u201d during the fighting in northeast Syria. (ISIS is another name for the Islamic State.) \u201cWhat do we know about those folks?\u201d Todd asked.\n\nO\u2019Brien replied, \u201cYeah. I think that\u2019s Twitter intel. I\u2019ve seen that on Twitter as well. So I think the SDF\u2019s doing a pretty good job of keeping the ISIS fighters in the camps,\u201d referring to the Syrian Democratic Forces \u2014 a coalition of U.S.-backed militias that is led by the Syrian Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units, or YPG.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve lost many of these ISIS fighters from these prisons?\u201d Todd asked.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, \u201cthere were several thousand ISIS fighters that are under control, under SDF and Turkish control. We\u2019ve made it very clear to the Turks, we\u2019ve made it clear to the Kurds and to others in the region that we need to keep those folks under lock and key. And so you know I think it\u2019s a \u2014 and we\u2019re continuing to do that.\u201d\n\nOn a call with reporters on Oct. 23, a senior White House official was similarly dismissive of the reported number of escaped ISIS fighters, saying, \u201cThere are a lot of different numbers that are floating around in the press. I\u2019m not sure where they\u2019re coming from \u2014 you know, 100 fighters were released, 20 fighters were released or escaped; 10 fighters were out there.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s actually no mystery at all where the \u201cat least 100\u201d figure comes from.\n\nIn an interview on CNN on Oct. 22, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said, \u201cBased on the intelligence we have, the reporting we have, of the 11,000 detainees who were in Syria, we\u2019ve only had reports of a little bit more than 100 that have escaped.\u201d\n\nGiven the large number of ISIS detainees in Syria, Esper said, the number of reported escapees is \u201cgood news.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo right now, we have not seen this big prison break we all expected,\u201d Esper said.\n\nIn a hearing before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Oct. 23, the U.S. special envoy for Syria, James Jeffrey, cited the same figure. \u201cAs Secretary Esper said, we would say that the number is now over a hundred,\u201d Jeffrey said. \u201cWe do not know where they are.\u201d\n\nJeffrey also noted that the escapees represented a small percentage of the ISIS prisoners being held in Syria.\n\n\u201cAlmost all of the prisons that the SDF were guarding are still secured,\u201d Jeffrey said. \u201cThe SDF still has people there. We are monitoring that as best we can. We still have forces in Syria working with the SDF and one of the top priorities is these prisons.\u201d\n\nDuring a speech the same day, Trump said he had just spoken to Gen. Mazloum Kobani, the SDF military commander, and was assured \u201cthat ISIS is under very, very strict lock and key, and the detention facilities are being strongly maintained.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were a few that got out \u2014 a small number, relatively speaking \u2014 and they\u2019ve been largely recaptured,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAs we said, Jeffrey and Esper both cited a number \u2014 more than 100 \u2014 that is far more than \u201ca few.\u201d And neither confirmed that \u201cthey\u2019ve been largely recaptured.\u201d To the contrary, Jeffrey said, \u201cWe do not know where they are.\u201d\n\nIn testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Oct. 22 \u2014 during which Jeffrey put the number of escaped ISIS fighters at \u201cdozens\u201d \u2014 Sen. Chris Coons asked, \u201cDo we have any idea how those escaped ISIS fighters will be tracked, accounted for and recaptured?\u201d\n\nWe reached out to the State Department to see if it could update the number of captured ISIS fighters who have escaped, as well as provide information on how many may have been recaptured. A State Department spokesperson responded, \u201cThe State Department does not have any further information to provide at this time.\u201d We also reached out to the Defense Department press office, but we did not hear back.\n\nWe can\u2019t confirm whether the number of escaped ISIS fighters is over 100, or how many may have been recaptured, but the figure did not arise from social media speculation. It came from two top Trump administration officials.\n\nWho will oversee the ISIS detention facilities in the future? The White House said, \u201cTurkey will now be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the area captured over the past two years.\u201d But, according to the New York Times, \u201cTurkey has given no public sign that it has agreed to take over that headache.\u201d The Times report said it is possible the Syrian government could take over some of the prisons.", "lang": "en"}
