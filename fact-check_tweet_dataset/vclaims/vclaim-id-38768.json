While the post did include some basic advice that is worth following, it also contained some claims which could have falsely led people to believe they don\u2019t have Covid-19 when they do, or which suggested ways of preventing infection that will not work.\n\nDuring the writing of this fact check, the post was edited by the author to alter some of the more inaccurate claims, and after we first published this article, the person who posted it removed the inaccurate claims. However, as the post had already been shared over 300,000 before these edits occurred, we\u2019re going to focus on the original version of the text as it will have been so widely seen.\n\nHaving a runny nose and sputum (phlegm coughed up from the lungs) doesn\u2019t rule out having Covid-19.\n\nIt\u2019s true that early studies on the new coronavirus have found that a runny nose (rhinorrhoea in medical terminology) is a relatively uncommon symptom, but some patients did have it. At least one other study has found it to be a more common symptom. So if you have a runny nose you may still have Covid-19.\n\nCovid-19\u2019s main symptoms are a new, continuous cough, and a high temperature, but the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) says \u201csputum production\u201d is a less common, but still reported, symptom. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that a third of coronavirus patients were producing sputum.\n\nThe term pneumonia describes the swelling of lung tissue. It\u2019s usually caused by a bacterial infection, and has been seen in Covid-19 patients. One of the most common symptoms of Covid-19 is a dry cough. But as we\u2019ve already said, having a runny nose doesn\u2019t rule out Covid-19.\n\nBecause the virus is relatively new to us, there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about it, like the temperatures it can withstand. You should be wary of sources that claim to have details this specific so early after the discovery of the virus. What we can do is look at related viruses. Coronavirus is a family of viruses including the common cold, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19).\n\nStudies have found that another coronavirus, MERS, was more stable at lower temperatures, and a warmer, humid environment slowed its transmission. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says coronaviruses in general can be destroyed at cooking-levels of heat, at around 70\u00b0C.\n\nDespite this, it\u2019s worth noting that going in the sun is unlikely to protect you from the virus, and you\u2019re better off concentrating on washing your hands thoroughly. Some of the countries with confirmed coronavirus cases have warmer climates where the temperature is often above 27\u00b0C.\n\nThere is no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 virus (which causes Covid-19) spreads differently to other coronaviruses, which can be transmitted by droplets produced by coughs and sneezes. It\u2019s difficult to say exactly how far droplets spread when you sneeze, as it depends on a range of factors like humidity and temperature. Research from MIT in recent years has shown that droplets from sneezes have the potential to spread several metres from the sneezing person. The NHS says you should cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or sleeve, but not your hands, when you sneeze, and put used tissues in the bin and wash your hands afterwards.\n\nThe WHO says \u201cStudies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days.\n\n\u201cThis may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t know how long the virus that causes Covid-19 can survive on surfaces yet, but washing your hands well with soap is good advice to prevent you picking up germs from surfaces.\n\nThe UK government advises people staying at home because of suspected Covid-19 symptoms that: \u201cWhen cleaning you should use your usual household products, like detergents and bleach as these will be very effective at getting rid of the virus on surfaces.\u201d\n\nThe advice says it is particularly important to clean \u201cfrequently touched surfaces such as door handles, handrails, remote controls and table tops.\u201d\n\nIt adds: \u201cTo minimise the possibility of dispersing virus through the air, do not shake dirty laundry.\n\nWash items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All dirty laundry can be washed in the same load.\n\nIf you do not have a washing machine, wait a further 72 hours after your 7-day (for individual isolation) or 14-day isolation period (for households) has ended when you can then take the laundry to a public launderette.\u201d We have more information on the NHS\u2019s guidance on how long isolation should last at the end of this article.\n\nThe CDC recommends that people who are in the same household as those with Covid-19 or someone suspected of having it, or those who are intimate partners or caregivers of them, should remove and wash soiled clothing, and wear disposable gloves when handling it. It says \u201cIn general, [use] a normal laundry detergent according to washing machine instructions and dry thoroughly using the warmest temperatures recommended on the clothing label.\u201d\n\nWe haven\u2019t found any reliable source saying exactly how long the virus can survive on fabric.\n\nWe can\u2019t find any scientific evidence that warm water can cure or prevent diseases caused by viruses, although hot drinks can be a comfort to those suffering with coughs and colds.\n\n\u201cWash your hands frequently as the virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 minutes, but - a lot can happen during that time - you can rub your eyes, pick your nose unwittingly and so on\u201d\n\nWashing your hands thoroughly, and often, is good advice. It\u2019s not clear exactly how long the virus can \u2018survive\u2019 on your hands, especially not down to the minute. But the post is right to mention that rubbing your eyes, mouth or nose is problematic if you haven\u2019t washed your hands, because these areas are a prime entry point for viruses and bacteria.\n\nOther fact checkers have also written about this claim, which was attributed to respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan, a key figure during the SARS outbreak. The hospital where he worked debunked the rumour via a post on social media site Weibo.\n\nGargling with salt water is recommended by the NHS for adults who have a sore throat, but only to relieve symptoms once you have caught it, not as a preventative measure. The WHO has said that there\u2019s no evidence saline can prevent Covid-19.\n\u2022 It will first infect the throat, so you'll have a sore throat lasting 3/4 days\n\u2022 The virus then blends into a nasal fluid that enters the trachea and then the lungs, causing pneumonia. This takes about 5/6 days further.\n\u2022 With the pneumonia comes high fever and difficulty in breathing.\n\u2022 The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind. You feel like you're drowning. It's imperative you then seek immediate attention by telephoning 111 or your doctor - don't visit.\u201d\n\nIn general, this is a roughly accurate description of the common symptoms of Covid-19, although some patients may experience other symptoms and the timing of those symptoms may differ.\n\nThe CDC says that sore throat has been reported \u201cin some patients\u201d. More commonly, symptoms include fever, a cough, muscle pain and shortness of breath, as the post claims. Not everyone who has Covid-19 will get pneumonia though. The NHS does not mention nasal congestion that \u2018feels like drowning\u2019 as a specific symptom for Covid-19.\n\nThe post was right at the time it was published to advise you to call 111 if you think you have the virus, and not visit your GP or a hospital in person. This advice has since changed.\n\nThe NHS now advises that if you have a high temperature or new, continuous cough you should stay at home for seven days. If the fever has gone after that time you may leave your home again. If you still have a high temperature, remain at home until it returns to normal. You can return to your normal routine if you still have a cough but no high temperature, as the cough can last for several weeks after the infection. New advice published on 18 May now says that anyone experiencing loss of taste or smell (known as 'anosmia') should also self isolate.\n\nIf you live with others, they should stay at home for at least 14 days to stop the virus spreading. After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. Anyone who has had symptoms should remain at home for seven days from the first day of their symptoms (even if this means being at home for more than 14 days in total).\n\nIf you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term health condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, the NHS says to try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days. If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.\n\nDo not go to a GP, pharmacy or hospital.\n\nIf these symptoms don\u2019t go away after seven days, if you can\u2019t cope with them at home or if you get worse then use the NHS online 111 coronavirus service. If you can\u2019t get the help you need there then you should call the 111 phone service.\n\nIf you have a medical emergency, you should still call 999 as you would normally.", "lang": "en"}
