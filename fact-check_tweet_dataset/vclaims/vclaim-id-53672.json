All of this money was made from lecturing you on income inequality!\u201d \u2014 have been reposted by a several additional Twitter accounts. This message was also turned into a meme that has been shared hundreds of thousands of times on Facebook:\n\nWhile Simone\u2019s post mentioned politicians Bernie Sanders and former President Barack Obama, for the purposes of this article we\u2019ll be focusing on the real estate rumors concerning Biden.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear which state this meme is referring to by \u201chis state.\u201d Biden was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, but he represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate for more than 30 years between 1973 and 2009. As Biden doesn\u2019t own any property in Pennsylvania (and therefore couldn\u2019t own the largest mansion in that state), we\u2019ll assume that this meme references Delaware, where Biden owns two properties.\n\nThe Washington Post reported in June 2019 that Biden owned two homes in Delaware: his primary residence, a 7,000-square-foot lakeside home in Wilmington, and a 4,800-square-foot vacation house in Rehoboth Beach. While these are both sizable and expensive properties (the beach house was purchased for $2.7 million), neither of them would be considered the \u201cbiggest mansion\u201d in the state of Delaware.\n\nBy one measure, the Winterthur Estate could be considered Delaware\u2019s largest mansion. The house was originally built in 1839 but has been enlarged considerably over the years. Henry Francis du Pont renovated the building between 1929 and 1931, resulting in a 175-room mansion sitting on 2,500 acres. This estate was turned into a museum in 1951, however, so some may not consider it to be the \u201clargest mansion\u201d in Delaware.\n\nThe Du Pont family built another massive property in Delaware in the early 1900s. While the Nemours Mansion dwarfs the properties owned by Biden at 47,000 sq. ft. (compared to 7,000), this property, too, no longer serves as a single-family residence and therefore may not be an applicable comparison.\n\nStill, Biden\u2019s Delaware homes are not the biggest in the state. We were able to find several articles concerning homes with more square footage than Biden\u2019s residence in Wilmington. The image below shows a 17,588-square-foot estate in Wilmington, for instance, according to Homes of the Rich:\n\nThe most expensive home in Delaware, according to Delaware Online, is a $14.9 million, 7,800-square-foot oceanfront home. Redfin.com also lists properties in excess of 7,000-square-feet, including this 9,957-square-foot property in Dewey Beach, and this 12,000-square-foot home in Wilmington.\n\nWhile Biden\u2019s Delaware homes are certainly large, they are not the biggest mansions in the state.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s June 2019 article about Biden\u2019s finances also mentioned that he had started renting a large home in McLean, Virginia, after leaving the White House:\n\nWhile the McLean property is larger than both of Biden\u2019s Delaware properties, it is not the biggest mansion in Virginia. For instance, a $62.95 million, 48,900-square-foot residence dubbed \u201cThe Falls\u201d went up for sale in McLean in 2018.", "lang": "en"}
