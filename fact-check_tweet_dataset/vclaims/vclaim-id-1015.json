This claim is false.\n\nExample posts can be found here , here , and here .\n\nText at the top of the video identifies the speaker as Celeste Solum and claims that she had a 20-year career as an officer for FEMA, the agency responsible for coordinating the government\u2019s response to disasters such as hurricanes or terror attacks ( www.fema.gov/about-agency ). A FEMA representative told Reuters via email that the agency \u201chas no record of a Celeste Solum having ever been a FEMA employee.\u201d\n\nSolum claims that \u201cwhen they\u2019re talking about testing for COVID, it is actually blood harvesting, and it is going into quantum super computers.\u201d She says that the purpose of this blood harvesting is to covertly mine information from \u201cdeep in your family history\u201d without your permission.\n\nTesting for the new coronavirus infection does not involve blood harvesting. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are two types of test for COVID-19, a viral test to check if a patient actively has the disease and an antibody test to check if a patient has previously been infected ( here). The former is performed via nasal swab, the latter is a blood test.\n\nQuest Diagnostics, a major manufacturer of viral tests for COVID-19 in the U.S., explained to Reuters via email its protocol for testing and disposing of nasal swab samples is to temporarily store specimens following a test, usually for around one week, in case doctors wish to follow up. \u201cAfter that temporary post-test completion storage interval is completed, the residual specimen is safely disposed of according to governmental regulations that pertain to that sample.\u201d\n\nUnlike viral tests, antibody tests do \u201ccheck your blood by looking for antibodies, which can show if you had a past infection with the virus that causes COVID-19,\u201d according to the CDC ( here ). Reuters found no evidence that these antibody tests would be used for blood harvesting.\n\nLabCorp, a major manufacturer of the antibody test, confirmed to Reuters via email these claims are untrue ( here ).\n\nA LabCorp representative said that for COVID-19 antibody testing, \u201c less than 15 milliliters of blood, or about half an ounce\u201d is required, and that \u201cany residual portion of the sample that remains after testing is completed is discarded following required waiting period.\u201d The spokesperson pointed to exceptions when a healthcare provider might want to test a patient\u2019s sample again, and small amounts \u201cused for equipment validation and quality control purposes.\u201d They confirmed these samples are stored for up to seven days.\n\nThere are secondary claims in the video on Facebook, which are out of scope of this fact check.\n\nFalse. Testing for current COVID-19 infection does not involve harvesting blood. Residual blood in antibody tests is disposed of in accordance with laws and regulations. FEMA has no record of Celeste Solum ever being an employee.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our fact checking work here .", "lang": "en"}
