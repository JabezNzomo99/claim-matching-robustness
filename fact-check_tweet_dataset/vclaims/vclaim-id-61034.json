Polls now show a majority of Catholics favor marriage equality, as does the general electorate.\"\n\n \n\n Do a majority of Catholics really favor gay marriage?\n\n \n\n Goldstein provided PolitiFact New Jersey with two national surveys to support his statement, and they mostly do.\n\n \n\n First, let\u2019s note that both polls -- and another survey we found -- highlighted the views of white Catholics. Pollsters said this is done to control for race and because white Catholics are considered a swing voter group. But we\u2019re going to look at all Catholics since Goldstein didn\u2019t distinguish.\n\n \n\n Also, because the Catholics made up a smaller group than the poll sample, the margins of error are higher.\n\n \n\n An ABC News/Washington Post poll released in March asked 1,005 adults, \"do you think it should be legal or illegal for gay and lesbian couples to get married?\" It found that among those who identified themselves as Catholic, 60 percent support same-sex marriage and 38 percent oppose it, with a 7.5 percentage point margin of error. \n\n \n\n A Public Religion Research Institute poll released in May surveyed 1,007 adults. It asked respondents whether they strongly favor, favor, oppose or strongly oppose \"allowing gay and lesbian couples to legally marry.\"\n\n \n\n It found among the Catholics surveyed, 56 percent either favored or strongly favored and 36 percent either opposed or strongly opposed, with a margin of error of 7 percentage points.\n\n \n\n It\u2019s worth noting that in another national poll by the Public Religion Research Institute from September 2010, when Catholics were given the option of choosing civil unions, support for marriage dipped.\n\n \n\n It found that of the Catholics surveyed, 43 percent said gay couples should be allowed to marry, 31 percent said gay couples should be allowed to form civil unions but not marry and 22 percent said there should be no legal recognition of a gay couple\u2019s relationship. It\u2019s also worth noting that in that poll, the more often Catholics said they went to church, the less likely they were to support same-sex marriage.\n\n \n\n A national Quinnipiac University poll released in July that asked 2,311 registered voters whether they \"would support or oppose a law in your state that would same-sex couples to get married?\"\n\n \n\n Of the Catholics surveyed, 53 percent said they would support such a law in their state and 41 percent said they would oppose, with a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points.\n\n \n\n Mark Gray, a research associate with the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, pointed to his analysis of 2010 data from the General Social Survey, which found that 48 percent of Catholics either strongly agreed or agreed that \"homosexual couples should have the right to marry one another\" and 36 percent disagreed or strongly disagreed, with a 5.8 percentage point margin of error.\n\n \n\n \"Right now at this point you can\u2019t really say it\u2019s a majority, you can\u2019t really say it\u2019s not a majority, given the margin of error,\" Gray said.\n\n \n\n Michele Dillon, chair of University of New Hampshire\u2019s department of sociology, said \"the actual percentage varies poll to poll, it\u2019s either close or over 50 percent,\" but, \"the momentum is in favor of same-sex marriage\" -- both nationally and among Catholics.\n\n \n\n Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League, said \"there\u2019s no question there\u2019s been a movement\" in favor of same-sex marriage, mostly driven by a younger generation. Young people, \"including young Catholics, are far more likely to be supportive of gay marriage,\" he said.\n\n \n\n But, Donohue argued, \"people tend to be a bit more liberal\" when asked their opinion on the phone, \"as opposed to the privacy of the ballot box.\"\n\n \n\n Back to Goldstein\u2019s statement.\n\n \n\n Goldstein said, \"polls now show a majority of Catholics favor marriage equality.\" We found polls generally support his claim.\n\n \n\n However, because the margins of error are so high -- enough to possibly affect the results -- we rate Goldstein\u2019s statement Mostly True.\n\nTo comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.", "lang": "en"}
