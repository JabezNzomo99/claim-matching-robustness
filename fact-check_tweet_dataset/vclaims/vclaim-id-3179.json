If we take a combined set of all resources (including \u201cmandatory\u201d and \u201cvoluntary\u201d), then it was already 5.6% of the GDP in 2015 according to data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\nIt\u2019s likely that he talked about the expenditures by the government. Government healthcare expenditures in Russia have been around 3.2% - 3.4% of the GDP as it is noted in the recently released report \u201cHealthcare: Much Needed Answers to the Modern Challenges\u201d issued by a Russian Center for Strategic Research (CSR).\n\nThe authors of the report clarify, \u201cHealthcare is traditionally a number one priority for Russians, getting ahead of security, a stable income, the environment and more. Satisfaction by accessible healthcare services is, on the contrary, is the lowest on the scale of satisfactions of daily living.\u201d\n\nAccording to the OECD, in 2000, those expenditures in Russia were 3% of the GDP. The peak was chronicled in 2009 at 3.5%. By 2011, the rate went back down to 3% after which it started to slowly grow.\n\nTo compare these rates with their counterparts from the 35 countries from the OECD report, we took the average measure of 3.3% from the CSR report:\n\nTo bring Russia healthcare expenditures up to the level of \u201cmore than 4% of the GDP\u201d would mean leveling Russia up with South Korea, Lithuania and Poland of 2016. To make it 5% would mean to level Russia up with Greece, Chile, Estonia and Hungary.\n\nThe CSR report tells us that the average level of healthcare expenditures in the OECD countries is 6.5% of the GDP, and 7.2% of the GDP in the European Union.", "lang": "en"}
