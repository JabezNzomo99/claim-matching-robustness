We've searched Instagram and there is no profile for a model named \"Spicy Salt\". And the picture of the woman apparently dates from 2004, six years before Instagram was even launched. It appears to be part of a series of photographs of someone's girlfriend posing with his car which were posted to a forum a long time ago and ended up being mocked and spread all over the internet.\n\nHuzlers styles itself as a \"fauxtire\" website and carries a disclaimer at the bottom of each page:\n\nAccording to Splinter News the site is run by Pablo Reyes and David Martinez and according to Buzzfeed Reyes is involved with several other fake news websites. They tend to shy away from political stories, opting instead to write for a more \"urban\" audience, with stories about rappers, criminals and celebrities.", "lang": "en"}
