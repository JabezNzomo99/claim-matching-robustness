Let\u2019s try to analyze the claims made in the post.\n\nClaim: Drinking hot lemon water or three spoons of organic coconut oil daily in addition to not taking sugar can cure cancer. Fact: No research studies were found to substantiate the claims (curing cancer with sugar-free diet, drinking hot lemon water, and organic coconut oil) made in the post. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched for the doctor with the name \u2018Dr Guru Prasad Reddy B.V.\u201d at the Osh State Medical University, no such person was found on the internet. Also, the Osh State Medical Facility was found to be in Kyrgyzstan, not in Russia.\n\nIn the post, there are majorly three specific diets prescribed to cure/prevent cancer.\n\n1. Avoiding sugar intake will lead to the death of cancer cells?\n\n\n\nWhen searched on Google with the keywords \u2018without sugar cancer cells die\u2019, some articles related to the claim can be found in the search results. According to Cancer Research UK, \u2018there\u2019s no evidence that following a \u201csugar-free\u201d diet lowers the risk of getting cancer, or boosts the chances of surviving if you are diagnosed.\u2019 The CEO of Cancer Council Australia, Professor Sanchia Aranda in an interview to ABC News says, \u201cStopping sugar getting to cancer cells would also mean that your body\u2019s healthy cells get starved of necessary sugars. I think that would make you lose weight, [and]would make your immune system less efficient and more likely that a cancer would progress.\u201d So, avoiding sugar totally might sometimes affect negatively too. A similar article by American Institute for Cancer Research can be read here.\n\nThere is some research done by a few scientists from Singapore and Austria which found that only some cancer cells could be killed by sugar starvation under the conditions of elevated calcium. But, according to Asian Scientist article, \u2018the team aims to further their research to develop a new cancer treatment in the future.\u2019 The research article can be read here.\n\nWhen looked for any information on this claim, it was found that the \u2018National Centre for Health Research\u2019 published an article with the title, \u2018Do Lemons Prevent Cancer?\u2019 on its website. According to the article, \u201cthe claims that \u2018lemons are a proven remedy against cancer of all types\u2019 and \u2018lemons are 10,000 times stronger than chemotherapy\u2019 are certainly false.\u201d Also, a fact-check article by Snopes, back in 2011, rating the claim as false can be found in the search results. Some more articles on this issue by medical organizations can be read here and here.\n\n3. Drinking 3 spoons full of organic coconut oil daily, at morning and night, can cure cancer?\n\nWhen searched Google with the keywords \u2018Coconut oil cures cancer\u2019, no proper research on this specific issue was found on the internet. Some articles reporting that few components of coconut oil had an effect on some forms of cancer can be read here and here. But, even those articles pushed for further studies on the topic. The Harvard School of Public Health on its website writes, \u2018Many of the health claims for coconut oil refer to research that used a special formulation of coconut oil made of 100% medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), not the commercial coconut oil most available on supermarket shelves.\u2019 So, even if some research studies claim that the coconut can cure cancer, then they may not be based on coconut oil readily available in the market for consumers.\n\nSome more myths on Cancer debunked by Cancer Research \u2013 UK can be read here.\n\nTo sum it up, there is no scientific basis for claims of curing cancer with a sugar-free diet, drinking hot lemon water, and organic coconut oil.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
