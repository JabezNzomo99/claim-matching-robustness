It is\n\n(IARC), a specialised cancer agency of the World Health Organisation. The latest one\n\nTo estimate cancer deaths in Nigeria, the IARC\n\nfrom the three\n\nregistries that are members of the\n\nIt then used a model based on\n\nto calculate the number of deaths each year.\n\nThe agency estimated that 71,571 Nigerians died of cancer in 2012, or just over eight an hour.\n\nBut data on cancer deaths is not that robust in Nigeria, an IARC communications officer, V\u00e9ronique Terrasse, told Africa Check. Ekanem said some of the uncertainty is because Nigeria does not enforce\n\nAnother reason is \u201cpoor or incomplete follow-up data on cancer patients in the cancer registries after discharge from hospitals\u201d. Some patients cannot be traced when the contact details they gave are wrong or become outdated.\n\nStill, could more people be dying of cancer now, pushing up the estimated number of deaths to 10 an hour?\n\nBoth Dr Festus Egbinoba, the chief clinical oncologist at the\n\nwhere Abuja\u2019s population-based registry is located, and Calabar\u2019s Ekanem said the number of cancer cases they register are increasing, so it\u2019s possible.\n\nMany cancer deaths in Nigeria are avoidable. Some cancer sufferers only go to see a doctor when it\u2019s too late, a major factor fuelling cancer deaths in Nigeria.\n\nRemi Ajekigbe, a professor of radiotherapy and oncology at the\n\nmentioned that Nigeria had far too few radiotherapy machines.\n\nCost was also prohibitive, as the Nigerian government didn\u2019t provide any assistance, Ekanem added.\n\nConclusion: Data in Nigeria not reliable enough to assess if at least 10 Nigerians die from cancer hourly\n\nTo highlight the cancer toll in Nigeria, a health reporter in a national daily said at least 10 Nigerians die from cancer every hour.\n\nthat 71,571 Nigerians died of cancer in 2012, or just over eight an hour.
