A similar story was also published in May on the website yournewswire.com, and that version had tens of thousands of Facebook interactions.\n\nThe stories attempt to portray the Atlantic Council as a Soros operation simply because his philanthropic organization donated to the council.\n\nThe Open Society Initiative for Europe, a branch of Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations, is listed as having given the Atlantic Council between $10,000 and $24,999 during the 2016 fiscal year (that donation is listed as being exclusively for the 2016 Wroclaw Global Forum).\n\nOpen Society Foundations also has donated to the Ploughshares Fund, a foundation that advocates against nuclear weapons, which gave the Atlantic Council between $100,000 and $249,000 in the 2016 fiscal year.\n\nAmong many others that have donated to the Atlantic Council is the Charles Koch Institute, an educational nonprofit of the billionaire businessman and conservative political donor.\n\nIn 2016, the council reported a budget of about $24 million, according to its IRS filing that year.\n\nThe Atlantic Council positions itself as a nonpartisan organization that welcomes diverse viewpoints, and a spokeswoman cited its intellectual independence policy when asked about the false claim that Soros would be working on the Facebook project.\n\n\u201cIntellectual independence is the entire foundation of our work,\u201d the spokeswoman, Nicole Meir, wrote in an email to FactCheck.org. \u201cFacebook and Open Society Foundations have \u2014 separately \u2014 decided to support our work, but neither coordinate or have veto or influence over the scale and scope of our research and reporting.\u201d\n\nSoros does not sit on the board of the Atlantic Council and is not a member of its staff. And we could find no evidence that he is personally involved with \u2014 or has been hired to work on \u2014 Facebook\u2019s partnership with the Atlantic Council.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.
