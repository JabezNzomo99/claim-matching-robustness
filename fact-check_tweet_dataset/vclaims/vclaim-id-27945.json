This seems to be based on a website post referring to a now-offline website listing the declarations of financial interest made by Conservative MPs.\n\nThis is wrong. The sums of money in question are not \u201cdonations\u201d to the Conservative party. They appear to be fees paid directly to the individual MPs for appearing on BBC programmes.\n\nSimilar fees are also paid by other major broadcasters and national newspapers, and they are paid to politicians from many parties.\n\nWhat\u2019s the story behind the claims?\n\nThe data comes from a website called searchthemoney.com, which is no longer online (although the Twitter account still exists and some of its pages have been archived on the Wayback Machine).\n\nThe original post says that this website was \u201ccreated\u201d by the Conservatives themselves; however, according to reports at the time it was actually set up by left-wing activists. It took data from sources like the Electoral Commission and the parliamentary Register of Members\u2019 Financial Interests to show sources of money going to Conservative MPs.\n\nThe archived pages for the BBC from March 2016 show a total of \u00a319,324.95 being paid to 17 Conservative MPs (it\u2019s not clear from the archived page what time period this covers, although other evidence suggests it is taken from some point in 2014). The highest paid is Rory Stewart MP, who is recorded as having received almost \u00a310,000 from the BBC.\n\nBut if you look at Mr Stewart\u2019s actual pages on the register of financial interests, the reason for this becomes clear. For example, he recorded two sums of \u00a34,100 in January 2014\u2014these were listed as \u201cPayments from BBC for documentary\u201d. Mr Stewart presented the BBC Two documentary \u201cBorder Country: The Story of Britain\u2019s Lost Middleland\u201d in 2014 (one of several documentaries he has fronted for the broadcaster).\n\nIf you look through the declared interests of other listed MPs, you can also see that they list appearance fees for programmes, from Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s appearances on \u201cAny Questions?\u201d to Glyn Davies\u2019s appearances on the BBC Welsh Language programme \u201cPawb a\u2019i Farn\u201d.\n\nSuch payments aren\u2019t limited to the BBC. The original post links to a PDF from 2014 listing all the \u201cdonors\u201d recorded on the website, which again shows the BBC as having paid over \u00a319,000. But the same document also records ITV as having paid over \u00a331,000, and Sky News as having paid \u00a31,700.\n\nNewspapers were also listed, including payments to Conservative MPs totalling over \u00a310,000 from the Guardian, and over \u00a32,000 from the Mirror, neither of which has traditionally been seen as a Conservative-supporting outlet.\n\nAnd the BBC\u2019s payments to politicians aren\u2019t limited to Conservative MPs. For example, during the same period Diane Abbott lists several thousand pounds in fees from the corporation due to her role co-presenting the BBC political show \u201cThis Week\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
