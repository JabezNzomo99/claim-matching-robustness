The administration has been under fire for its failure to quickly expand testing for coronavirus across the United States. A still-unspecified manufacturing problem caused the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to distribute flawed tests to state and local health departments. The lack of tests, compared with countries such as South Korea that have tested tens of thousands of people, has meant the spread of the virus in the United States may have been hidden in the early weeks of the outbreak.\n\nFrom mid-January until Feb. 28, fewer than 4,000 tests from the CDC were used out of more than 160,000 produced, The Washington Post reported. \u201cIn South Korea, more than 66,650 people were tested within a week of its first case of community transmission, and it quickly became able to test 10,000 people a day,\u201d the Atlantic reported on March 7. \u201cThe United Kingdom, which has only 115 positive cases, has so far tested 18,083 people for the virus.\u201d\n\nCommunity transmission means someone is infected even though they have not been in contact with someone who had traveled abroad. The first such case in the United States was reported on Feb. 28. Even as of March 17, according to the New York Times, about 125 people per million have been tested in the United States, far fewer than many other countries. By contrast, Italy has tested more than 2,000 per million and South Korea more than 5,000 per million.\n\nOn March 12, the day before the news conference, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) at a congressional hearing asked U.S. officials to identify the person in charge of \u201cmaking sure there were enough tests [so] as many people as possible across this country have access to getting tested as soon as possible.\u201d Robert Redfield, the director of the CDC, had trouble answering the question so Fauci stepped in.\n\nFAUCI: \u201cThe system \u2014 the system does not \u2014 is not really geared to what we need right now, what you are asking for. That is a failing.\u201d FAUCI: \u201cThe fact is the way the system was set up is that the public health component that Doctor \u2014 that Doctor Redfield was talking about, was a system where you put it out there in the public and a physician ask for it and you get it. The idea of anybody getting it easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we are not set up for that. Do I think we should be? Yes, but we are not.\u201d\n\nABC NEWS: \u201cSo you testified today that the U.S. testing system is currently failing and that we\u2019re not set up for universal testing. Who\u2019s responsible for this failure?\u201d FAUCI: \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anyone that\u2019s responsible. What I was referring to is that the system as it was originally designed was really designed for a patient to doctor relationship in which the CDC would make a test, give it to the public health authorities in a particular state or local section, and if someone needed a test they would get an individual test. What it was not designed for was the broad, more global as it were, screening. Where you could not only get a test for an individual but you could go and essentially blanket the country to find out how many people are actually infected. That was something that was originally worked really very well for the systems that were in place then.\u201d\n\nFAUCI: \u201cSo just to reiterate what I said to many of you multiple times, it\u2019s the [inaudible] of a system. The system was not designed \u2014 for what it was designed for it worked very well. The CDC designed a good system. If you want to get the kind of blanket testing and availability that anybody can get it or you could even do surveillance to find out what the penetrance is, you have to embrace the private sector. And this is exactly what you\u2019re seeing, because you can\u2019t do it without it. So when I said that, I meant the system was not designed for what we need. Now, looking forward, the system will take care of it.\u201d\n\nFAUCI: \u201cYou know, it was a complicated series of multiple things that conflated that just, you know, went the wrong way. One of them was a technical glitch that slowed things down in the beginning. Nobody\u2019s fault. There wasn\u2019t any bad guys there. It just happened. And then when we realized, when the CDC realized, and the FDA said both the system itself as it was set up, which serves certain circumstances very well, was not well-suited to the kind of broad testing that we needed the private sector to get involved in.\u201d\n\nAs you can see, there are two things going on here. The CDC had a testing breakdown because of a flawed test. At the same time, the administration did not move quickly to get the private sector involved \u2014 that is the failure that Fauci referred to in his congressional testimony, not the production failure that happened with the test. Fauci went on to tell Hewitt that the test-production failure \u201chas nothing to do with anybody\u2019s fault, certainly not the president\u2019s fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the number of cases increases, experience from the 2009 swine flu pandemic and the 2015 Zika epidemic suggests that the CDC will struggle to keep up with the volume of screening,\u201d wrote Luciana Borio, who had been Trump\u2019s director for medical and biodefense preparedness policy at the National Security Council, and Scott Gottlieb, who had been Trump\u2019s commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. \u201cGovernment should focus on working with private industry to develop easy-to-use, rapid diagnostic tests that can be made available to providers.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
