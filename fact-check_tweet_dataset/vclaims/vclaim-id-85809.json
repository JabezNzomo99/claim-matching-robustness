This has been the trend for the past six years, since the start of the Kenyatta administration.\n\u2022 None While Mudavadi was also correct that the budget for the judiciary is about half that allocated to parliament, he fudged some crucial facts in his explanations of why this shouldn\u2019t be so.\n\u2022 None It is incorrect and misleading to say courts sit for six days a week compared to parliament\u2019s three, and Mudavadi was also incorrect about the number of staff employed by both institutions. \n\n\n\nThe state of Kenya\u2019s economy continues to\n\nfor the new financial year which started on 1 July.\n\non national TV on 11 June, Mudavadi specifically criticised the allocation for debt repayments, and also focused on funding for parliament and the\n\nThe former vice president and deputy prime minister has recently\n\nof the government's handling of the economy. On TV he made six key claims which we took a closer look at.\n\nWe asked Mudavadi for evidence for the claims, and will update this report with his response. In the interview, he frequently referred to Yatani\u2019s budget statement.\n\nCurrent levels of the public debt are a national talking point. There is\n\nto set up an agency to oversee this. In his speech, Yatani said Kenya had to be \u201ccautious about future debt accumulation\u201d and would look to borrow cheaply.\n\nBut the budget had not shown any urgency to correct a \u201ccritical landmine\u201d, Mudavadi said. He gave the amount set aside for debt repayment as \u201cKSh900 billion, almost KSh1 trillion\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are dealing with a situation where the amount set aside for repayment of the debt is much higher than all the money that Yatani is putting together for development expenditure,\u201d he\n\nHow much for loan payments?\n\nHow much has been budgeted for debt repayment? A\n\nfrom the national assembly\u2019s budget committee said that debt service for the 2020/21 financial year was an estimated KSh904.7 billion.\n\nThe cost of debt financing \u201cactually consumes more financial resources than development expenditure for which the debt is obtained\u201d, the committee\n\nWhat about for development projects?\n\nas the development budget. The treasury had\n\nKSh584.3 billion, while minister Yatani said the amount was KSh633.1 billion in his budget speech. All these figures are less than that set aside for repaying debt.\n\nTo evaluate how much money has been used over the years to repay debt and for development, the monthly statements issued by treasury are beneficial, James Muraguri told Africa Check. He is the chief executive of the\n\n\u201cThis is the best document to use because it provides the actual money that is released out of the consolidated fund,\u201d Muraguri said.\n\nis where all income raised and revenues collected by the national government is kept. The fund first provides for obligatory payments such as debt repayments, salaries for some state officers and pensions.\n\ncan other departments access the money.\n\nWe checked all the treasury\u2019s annual statements since 2013, when president Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s administration started, to establish if debt repayments exceeding the development budget was a once off, or a trend.\n\nThe numbers show debt repayments have exceeded the development budget for the last six financial years. The budgeted figures for the 2019/20 financial year, which ended 30 June, also\n\ndebt service was expected to take up KSh696.6 billion, while the development budget was\n\nHowever, by 29 May, a month before the end of the financial year,\n\nhad been issued to pay debts, while\n\nhad been issued for development expenditure. We therefore rate Mudavadi\u2019s claim as correct.\n\nWe therefore rate Mudavadi\u2019s statement as mostly correct.\n\nWe asked the judiciary if this was correct.\n\n\u201cCourts do not usually sit on Saturday or Sunday unless they have express permission from the chief justice in writing, and that has to be under exceptional circumstances,\u201d\n\n, acting director of communications at the judiciary, told Africa Check.\n\nShe said this was rare, and cited the\n\nKenya\u2019s constitution within which presidential election petitions must be determined as an example of when this had happened.\n\nDuring presidential election petition hearings in 2013 and in 2017, the judiciary sat on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nBut it is not the norm for Kenyan courts to sit six days a week. They sit from Monday to Friday and do not sit on public holidays.\n\nJudicial staff may also be called in to work on public holidays to \u201cto perform certain essential duties\u201d, according to the judiciary\u2019s\n\nat \u201c2.30 pm on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday\u201d.\n\nHowever, the rules allow each of the two houses, by resolution \u201cto meet at any other time on a sitting day; or to meet on any other day, in order to transact business\u201d.\n\nCaroline Gaita is the chief executive of\n\n, a project that keeps tabs on parliamentary performance in Kenya. She said the perception that sitting days are the only working days for the Kenyan parliament was misleading.\n\nEquating the sitting days to their working days is doing a disservice to their role, she told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cThe work of a member of parliament cannot be limited to the three days when the house sits,\u201d she told Africa Check. \u201cThat is for their legislative role. They have other roles such as oversight and representation which are done through committees and/or physical visits to the constituencies\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cOn Fridays, throughout the weekend, and on Mondays they are usually in the constituencies. Committee meetings are usually held on Tuesday and Thursday mornings.\u201d\n\nWe therefore rate Mudavadi\u2019s claim as misleading.\n\nIt covers the 2018/19 financial year and\n\nthe judiciary had 5,584 employees on 30 June 2019. These were 153 judges, 546 magistrates and 4,885 other employees including registrars, legal researchers, law clerks and court assistants.\n\nIn the financial year 2019/20 the judiciary\n\nAt the highest, the number of employees in the judiciary could only be 5,884. Mudavadi was off the mark by more than 1,000 employees.

We therefore rate Mudavadi\u2019s claim as incorrect.\n\nThe judiciary\u2019s budget works out to about 48% of parliament\u2019s allocation.\u201cSometimes they are called even on a Saturday, in an emergency,\u201d he said.The sittings of both houses of Kenya\u2019s parliament are prescribed in the standing orders.
