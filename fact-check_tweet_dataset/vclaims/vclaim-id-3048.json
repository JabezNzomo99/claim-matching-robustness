{"title": "Analysis | Fact-checking Trump, NRA claims on gun background checks", "subtitle": "A national database that screens potential gun buyers has become a hot topic, but various claims about it miss the mark.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-02-23T08:00:56Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-3048", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/02/23/fact-checking-trump-nra-claims-on-gun-background-checks/", "vclaim": "A spokesman for the NRA did not respond to a question about this issue, but it seems like a stretch to say that the NICS \u201cwas our bill,\u201d as LaPierre said, considering that it came about as compromise language to avoid a five-day waiting period for gun purchases and that the NRA took a hostile position to the Brady law in the courts \u2014 and at one point worked to strike it down as unconstitutional.\n\nAs for the 7 million number for felonies that have not been reported to the NICS, the NRA said it came from the same report from the National Consortium for Justice Information and Statistics. Since it\u2019s an estimate based on 2010 figures, it\u2019s outdated, as well. For what it\u2019s worth, Congress pegged the number much higher, at 21 million, in 2008. [Update: We previously said that we didn\u2019t know where the 7 million figure came from, but the NRA sent us a report with this number. That report is based on 2010 figures, and the group that published it said the 7 million estimate is no longer up to date.]\n\nThe NICS clearly suffers from incomplete records. Most background checks on the NICS are conducted by the states, not federal agencies, but a 2016 audit by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general found that in 630 of 631 selected cases from 2008 to 2014, states did not properly update the database or inform the FBI of the background check\u2019s outcome. \u201cThese failures mean the NICS database is incomplete, and increases the risk that individuals found by states to be prohibited purchasers could be able to purchase firearms in the future,\u201d according to the audit.", "lang": "en"}
