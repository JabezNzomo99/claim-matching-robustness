The claim is false; the footage has previously circulated in reports about an incident at a protest in Nepal.\n\nThe nine-second footage was published here on Facebook on February 29, 2020. It has been viewed more than two million times and shared more than 34,000 times.\n\nThe post's Indonesian-language caption translates to English as: \u201cAre They This Bad\n\nBelow is the screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nDelhi has recently seen its worst sectarian violence in decades. At least 50 people have been killed in clashes triggered by months-long protests against Prime Minister Narendra Modi's citizenship law. Critics claim the law discriminates against Muslims. This is an AFP report about the violence.\n\nDelhi police have been accused of beating up protesters during the violence, as reported here by Indian news site Scroll.in.\n\nThe same footage also appeared with a similar claim on Facebook here, here, here and here; as well as on Twitter here and here, where it has been viewed more than 9,600 times.\n\nThe claim is false; the video previously appeared in media reports about a police officer who baton-charged a woman at a protest in Bhaisepati, in Karyabinayak municipality, Nepal, in February 2020.\n\nA Google reverse image followed by a subsequent keyword search found this 17-minute, 47-second high-definition video uploaded on a YouTube channel named Rhythm online tv on February 27, 2020.\n\nAn AFP journalist at the Kathmandu bureau translated the video\u2019s title from Nepali to English as: \u201cMala Shah \u2013 Police bullying inside the general\u2019s house. Mala, Hema and baby hit with batons. Hema Shrestha\u201d.\n\nThe footage in the misleading post can be seen at the beginning of the video and at the eight-minute 30-second mark.\n\nThe woman who was baton-charged by the police was identified as Hema Shrestha. After she was beaten, at the 11-minute mark, the woman shouted in front of a crowd questioning the police\u2019s action. She said: \u201cWhy did the police beat me? Did I commit any crime? Have killed anyone? Should they catch the criminal or be unjust towards the victim?\u201d\n\nThe officer who beat the woman was interviewed at the 11-minute 19-second mark, saying: \u201cWhat option is there when they refuse to cooperate with the police and forcefully enter someone else's house?\u201d\n\nBelow is the screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading posts (L) and the video in YouTube (R):\n\nThe Kathmandu Post, a local English-language newspaper, published this report about the protest on February 28, 2020, headlined: \u201cVideo of police officer baton charging a woman carrying a child outrages the public.\u201d\n\nThe fifth paragraph of the article reads: \u201cAccording to police, the incident took place on Thursday at the Bhainsepati residence of Hem Khatri, a retired Nepal Army general, where a group of women had gathered to protest, \u2018demanding justice\u2019 for a woman, identified as Mala Shah, who has alleged that she was in a relationship with Khatri. Shah began protesting after Khatri allegedly broke off contact with her, according to Senior Superintendent Tek Prasad Rai, chief of the Lalitpur Police. Hema Shrestha, the woman seen being beaten, was there to support Shah in her protest.\u201d\n\nBelow is the screenshot of the Kathmandu Post\u2019s report:\n\nThe Himalayan Times, another local English-language newspaper, interviewed Shrestha, on February 28, 2020, in this report, headlined: \u201cPolice inspector mercilessly beats up woman\u201d.\n\nOther Nepali media also published a report about the incident, for example MyRepublica and here and The Nepalese Voice here.", "lang": "en"}
