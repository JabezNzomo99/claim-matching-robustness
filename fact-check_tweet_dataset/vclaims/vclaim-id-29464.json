To give context, Moitra had warned of seven \u201cearly signs of fascism\u201d rising in India during her maiden speech in the Parliament on June 25.\n\nChaudhary tweeted images of the article from where, he claimed, words were \u201cstolen\u201d for Moitra\u2019s speech. \u201cThe Parliament\u2019s dignity is in danger,\u201d he wrote.\n\nChaudhary alleged that the MP\u2019s speech was plagiarised from a 2017 article which spoke about \u201c12 early warning signs of fascism\u201d in Donald Trump\u2019s America. \u201cHer speech replaced \u2018Trump\u2019 with \u2018Modi\u2019,\u201d asserted thejournalist while holding a printout of the said article to the camera.\n\nThe name of the article\u2019s author \u2013 Martin Longman \u2013 is faintly visible upon a close look at the piece of paper in Chaudhary\u2019s hands. On January 31, 2017, such an article was indeed penned by Longman, published in Washington Monthly. The author claimed that the signs stood hung on a poster in the US Holocaust Museum.\n\nMany other prominent individuals \u2013 Shobha De, Makarand Paranjape, Kanchan Gupta \u2013 had claimed Moitra\u2019s speech was plagiarised before Zee News ran an entire show on the assertion. Vivek Agnihotri also made the same allegation.\n\nThe \u2018truth\u2019 about Moitra\u2019s speech which Chaudhary claimed to have investigated,was a misreport. Towards the end of her Parliamentary address, the MP had mentioned the source of her inspiration behind the address.\n\nAt 9:12 minutes in the video below, she can be heard saying, \u201cIn 2017, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum put up a poster in its main lobby and it contained a list of all the signs of early fascism. Each of the seven signs I have pointed to you, features on that poster.\u201d\n\nLongman, in his 2017 article, had referenced the same poster/sign that Moitra talked about. It is noteworthy that a 2017 fact-check by American website Snopeshad found that the poster was not on display at the museum but was available in its gift shop.\n\nAfter a controversy was sparked by Zee News and several others, Longman tweeted that Moitra is being \u201cfalsely accused\u201d of plagiarism.\n\nHe reiterated the same in another tweet.\n\nIn a press statement, Moitra clarified that her speech was inspired by \u201cthe poster from the Holocaust Museum created by Sr Lawrence W Brit pointing out the 14 signs of early fascism.\u201d She wrote, \u201cI found seven signs relevant to India and spoke at length about each of them\u201d and further added that she mentioned her source during the address and \u201cplagiarism is when one does not disclose one\u2019s source.\u201d\n\nAlt News found a copy of an excerpt where Dr Britt spoke about the 14 signs. It was published in the Free Inquiry Magazine, Vol 22 no 2, on July 15, 2003.\n\nA speech was reported to be plagiarised by Zee News when, in fact, TMC MP Mahua Moitra had used a piece of literature as a reference and had mentioned the same during her address. After the same was pointed out toSudhir Chaudhary by several people, including the author of the article, he wrote in a tweet, \u201cthe TukdeTukdeGang has been demolished and is crying foul again,\u201d instead of rectifying the misreport.", "lang": "en"}
