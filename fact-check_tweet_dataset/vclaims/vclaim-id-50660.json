Forster once stated, \u201cWe must be willing to let go of the life we have planned, so as to have the life that is waiting for us.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence the quote originated with Forster.\n\nForster, a British writer and literary critic, wrote prolifically during his lifetime, amassing a large body of work. He is perhaps best known for his books \u201cHowards End,\u201d \u201cA Passage to India\u201d and \u201cA Room with a View.\u201d\n\nHowever, the expression appears nowhere in these works or any of his others. A search of the Papers of Edward Morgan Forster at the King\u2019s College Archives yielded no similar or matching phrases either. The collection, which Forster bequeathed to King\u2019s College in 1970, contains many of his novels, short stories, essays, plays and poems.\n\nThe DCNF also reached out to a number of experts, none of whom recognized the quotation.\n\n\u201cIt does not sound to me like Forster in his novels, anyway, although the idea is Forster-like,\u201d Krzysztof Fordonski, chairman of the International E.M. Forster Society, said in an email to the DCNF.\n\nThe saying may actually come from Joseph Campbell, an American professor and author known for his work in comparative mythology, according to the website Quote Investigator. In her 1991 book \u201cReflections on the Art of Living: A Joseph Campbell Companion,\u201d Diane Osbon quoted Campbell as having said the statement attributed to Forster in the Facebook post, though the wording differed slightly.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
