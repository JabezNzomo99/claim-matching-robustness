Its post attracted over 7,000 likes and 700 shares. Several individual users and other Facebook groups and pages also shared the photograph with the same narrative. From a page Justice for punjabi hindus, it attracted over 500 shares and more than 1,500 likes.\n\nThe photograph carries a stamp \u2013 \u2018Indian Army Protect Us\u2019, which led us to the Facebook page that created the image. The post, captioned \u201cmother and soldier\u201d, has 25,000 likes and over 5,000 shares.\n\nThe photograph and the accompanying text is also widespread on Twitter. From a handle @Ashok6510, it was retweeted 400 times and liked over 900 times. @Ashok6510 is the same individual who had earlier tweeted a video from Jharkhand, falsely claiming that it depicted Muslims thrashing Rajputs.\n\nThe photograph seems to be viral on WhatsApp as well.\n\nCirculated by many users followed by senior BJP leaders\n\nAmong those who circulated the post were the ones followed by senior BJP leaders including, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal\u2019s Office (1, 2, 3), BJP President Amit Shah and the party\u2019s spokesperson Sambit Patra.\n\nThe tweet by one Roop Darak, who identifies himself as a Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) member, was retweeted nearly 150 times.\n\nNOT the daughter of the Defense Minister\n\nDue to the claim\u2019s widespread circulation on social media, the official handle of the Principal Spokesperson of the Defense Ministry tweeted a clarification that the officer in the picture is not the daughter of Nirmala Sitharaman. The photograph was shot during an official visit of the Defense Minister at the request of the army officer, appointed as the LO to the RM.\n\nThe viral claims were earlier debunked by Boomlive, which found that the officer in the photograph is Nikita Veeraiah. Sitharaman\u2019s daughter\u2019s name is Vangmayi Parakala.\n\nThe image of Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman with an officer of the Indian Armed Forces was thus viral as she posing with her daughter.", "lang": "en"}
