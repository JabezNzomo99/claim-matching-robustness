Under three presidents -- Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama -- Congress enacted nine tax bills worth in the tens of billions of dollars in revenue reductions over four years.\n\nThese measures were not obscure pieces of legislation.\n\nThe list includes the two big Bush tax cuts from 2001 and 2003, arguably the signature domestic policy achievements of his presidency. Among other things, these bills cut rates for the top bracket from 39.6 percent to 35 percent.\n\nThe list also includes the extension of many of those tax cuts in advance of their scheduled expiration in 2013 under Obama -- a high-stakes legislative situation known as the \"fiscal cliff.\" (The top-bracket rate was one that did not continue; it rose again to 39.6 percent.)\n\nTrump's statement is ridiculously wrong -- since 1997, nine major tax bills have passed with tens of billions of dollars in cuts.
