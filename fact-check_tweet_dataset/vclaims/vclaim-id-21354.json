Let\u2019s try to check the veracity of the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Lecturer Shabir Ahmed beaten to death by the Army in Kashmir after 5th August 2019. Fact: The YouTube video shared in the post is actually uploaded on 19 August 2016. Hence the claim that lecturer Shabir Ahmed was beaten to death by the Army in Kashmir after 05 August 2019 is FALSE.\n\nThe video is being shared widely across Facebook currently. It has attracted more than 950 shares by the time this article is written.\n\nWhen the timestamp of the \u2018Times Now\u2019 news video in the post is observed, it was found to be uploaded on 19 August 2016.
