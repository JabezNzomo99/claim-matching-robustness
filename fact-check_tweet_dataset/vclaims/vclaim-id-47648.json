Almost all the queries to Snopes shared the following passage:\n\nIn around 2020 a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread throughout the globe, attacking the lungs and the bronchial tubes and resisting all known treatments. Almost more baffling than the illness itself will be the fact that it will suddenly vanish as quickly as it arrived, attack again ten years later, and then disappear completely.\n\nSnopes had encountered this page before, when social media users connected it to numerous sources including American author Dean Koontz and self-described psychic Sylvia Browne. The page actually originates from Sylvia Browne\u2019s 2008 book, \u201cEnd of Days.\u201d From our previous fact check on this story:\n\n[Browne] gained notoriety for her claims that she could predict the future and communicate with spirits. But she was also the subject of criticism for offering the grieving parents of missing children false information. Browne did vaguely write in her 2008 book that a respiratory illness would spread across the globe in 2020.\n\nWe argued that Browne\u2019s \u201cprediction\u201d was \u201cmore a matter of lucky guessing than predicting.\u201d We also wrote:\n\nAlmanacs, according to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, are books or tables that contain a calendar of the days, weeks, and months of the year. They keep records of astronomical phenomena, with climate information, seasonal suggestions for farmers, and other miscellaneous data.\n\nThe \u201cFarmer\u2019s Almanac,\u201d also known as \u201cOld Farmer\u2019s Almanac,\u201d has been annually published in the United States since 1792, while another \u201cFarmers\u2019 Almanac\u201d (note the placement of the apostrophe) was developed in 1818. They all usually contain weather predictions, planting schedules, recipes, and more. Their forecasts tend to focus on weather data.\n\nFrom Encyclopaedia Britannica\u2019s page on the \u201cFarmer\u2019s Almanac\u201d:\n\nAnd the \u201cFarmer\u2019s Almanac\u201d has gotten weather predictions wrong. The Grand Forks Herald, which covers daily news from northeast North Dakota and northwest Minnesota, described some incorrect predictions for 2019:\n\nNeither was the \u201cFarmers\u2019 Almanac,\u201d a rival to the \u201cOld Farmer\u2019s Almanac,\u201d known for being a scientifically accurate source of weather forecasts. According to a 1981 report from The New York Times, Harry K. Buie, a retired schoolteacher and the man who prepared the 1981 weather data, suffered a fatal heart attack just after compiling the data for 1982. Buie\u2019s methods for compiling this data were secretive and sketchy at best:\n\nIn any case, there is no evidence to support the claim that any 1981 almanac predicted a virus that would spread throughout the globe in 2020. The passage cited in social media posts as originating from the 1981 \u201cFarmer\u2019s Almanac\u201d or \u201cFarmers\u2019 Almanac\u201d was misattributed.", "lang": "en"}
