Part I,\u201d Polygraph.info revealed direct ties between the Russian government and the shell company \u201cT&R Production,\u201d under which RT operates in the United States.\n\nFrom the registration documents obtained from several Russian government agencies, Polygraph.info showed how RT is subordinate to the Russian government, and also provided evidence documenting direct Russian government funding of RT operations.\n\nPolygraph.info\u2019s investigation of RT\u2019s FARA filing bore out the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that \u201cRT has positioned itself as a domestic U.S. channel and has deliberately sought to obscure any legal ties to the Russian Government.\u201d\n\nIn its FARA filing, RT described its \u201cforeign principal\u201d as an \u201cNGO \u2013 nongovernment organization registered under the law of the Russian Federation.\u201d However, the registration documents in Russia shows that this \u201cNGO\u201d is just one brick in a pyramid, at the top of which sits the Russian government.\n\nThe pyramid consists of five firms and institutions. At the top are two government agencies \u2013 the Federal Agency for State Property Management and the Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications. Below them are the government-owned broadcaster RIA Novosti (MIA Rossia Segodnya), RT\u2019s Russian umbrella ANO TV-Novosti, and RT\u2019s American umbrella T&R Production.\n\nAnother finding involves the role RT\u2019s chief-in-editor Margarita Simonyan plays in the overall multilevel scheme built to hide the ties between RT and the Kremlin.\n\nSimonyan, who was until recently identified to the Western audience as RT\u2019s editor-in-chief, was identified, apparently for the first time, as \u201cSputnik and RT editor-in-chief\u201d in a November 21, 2017 RT report.\n\nIn fact, she was appointed to the position with Sputnik four years ago, in December 2013.\n\nSputnik is Russia\u2019s other international broadcaster, and submitted its own FARA registration forms on November 15 under a shell company called Reston Translator.\n\nThe fact that Simonyan\u2019s affiliation with Sputnik was kept low profile for four years appears to validate the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s assessment that RT deliberately attempted to pass itself off as an \u201cindependent\u201d news outlet. With Simonyan\u2019s position as Sputnik\u2019s top manager, RT\u2019s entire \u201cNGO\u201d fiction falls apart. The registration in Russia of Sputnik\u2019s parent agency, MIA Rossia Segodnya, reveals the government-owned pyramid: \u201cRegistered and owned by Russian Federation.\u201d\n\nHowever, Sputnik and RT are not the only firms listing Margarita Simonyan as chief editor.She is also editor-in-chief of RT\u2019s foreign principal ANO TV-Novosti \u2013 the organization \u201con behalf\u201d of which RT \u201cproduces news programs and talk shows that can be distributed in the USA and globally,\u201d as stated in RT\u2019s FARA documents.\n\nTwo of Symonyan\u2019s reporters are listed as CEOs of the RT\u2019s U.S. umbrella T&R Production and its Russian umbrella ANO TV-Novosti.\n\nTherefore Simonyan, while not mentioned in any of RT\u2019s or Sputnik FARA documents, remains the key manager of both entities and is directly subordinated to the CEO of the Russian government agency MIA Rossia Segodnya, Dmitry Kiselyov.\n\nWhen asked about the creation of MIA Rossia Segodnya back in December 2013, President Vladimir Putin\u2019s press secretary Dmitry Peskov said: \u201c\"The instruments of propaganda, you know, are an essential attribute of any state. That is [the case] everywhere. Accordingly, it must also be so in Russia.\u201d\n\nApart from her professional activities, Margarita Symonyan, according to the Russian Taxation Agency, is owner of a private enterprise which, along with \u201cbroadcasting services,\u201d is licensed to provide services in hotel, restaurant businesses and \u201cprofessional membership organizations.\u201d Oddly, while the \u201cSimonyan enterprise\u201d was registered in June 2011, its first filing with Russia\u2019s tax authorities is dated March 2017.", "lang": "en"}
