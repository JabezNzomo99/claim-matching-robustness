However, it was not taken in 1919 during the flu pandemic, and these masks were being worn for fashion, not medical, purposes.\n\nThis image is available via Alamy and presented with the title \u201cLadies\u2019 fashion from 1913.\u201d That image is also attached to a description in German that explains the trend imitated traditional veils worn in Turkey.\n\nAlthough this particular photograph shows two fashionable women, people were encouraged to wear masks during the \u201cSpanish flu\u201d pandemic. Here\u2019s a 1918 newspaper clipping from The Oakland Tribune announcing that police officers would start patrolling the streets to make sure people were wearing \u201cflu masks\u201d:\n\nThe 1918 H1N1 pandemic infected an estimated 500 million people (about a third of the world\u2019s total population) and resulted in an estimated 50 million deaths, 675,000 of which occurred in the United States. Mandating people wear protective masks was just one method cities in the United States used to fight the disease.\n\nAccording to CNN, the United States \u201cled the world in mask wearing\u201d during that pandemic. In some areas of the country, such as San Francisco, citizens were required to wear masks in public.\n\nIn October 1918, as San Francisco received the pandemic\u2019s second wave, hospitals began reporting a rise in the number of infected patients. On October 24, 1918, the city\u2019s elected legislative body, the Board of Supervisors of San Francisco, realizing that drastic action needed to be taken with over 4,000 cases recorded, unanimously passed the Influenza Mask Ordinance. The wearing of face masks in public became mandatory on US soil for the first time.\n\nA number of images showing this unusual time in American history can be found on Getty Images. Here are a few photographs showing police officers, sanitation workers, and everyday citizens wearing masks in an effort to prevent the spread of disease during the 1918 pandemic:", "lang": "en"}
