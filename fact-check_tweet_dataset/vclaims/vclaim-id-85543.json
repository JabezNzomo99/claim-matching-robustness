Are 1 in 4 Americans of prime working age not even employed?\n\nThe data indeed shows almost 1 in 4 Americans in prime working age are not employed, but according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, most (89 percent) of these people do not want jobs in the first place. Most, in fact, are women taking care of loved ones. If you go back to the mid-1970s (or earlier), the figures were even worse because more women were not in the workforce.\n\nHere\u2019s the data for women not participating in the workforce. As you can see, it has gone from 42 percent in 1977 to about 25 percent as women have begun working outside the home in large numbers.\n\nFinally, here\u2019s the data for men not participating. Since the 1980s, the percent of working-age men not participating in the workforce has climbed from about 6 percent to 11 percent. Some of this is a consequence of women moving into the workforce (stay-at-home dads) but a sharp jump occurred after the Great Recession. That has indeed been of concern to economists \u2014 who have identified factors such as high incarceration rates, increasing disability claims and the allure of video games. But Miller chose to go for the flashier statistic.\n\nThe Senate Budget Committee, where Miller used to work, frequently touted this 1-in-4 figure, but as the economy has improved, so have the numbers. Miller was careful to say \u201calmost one in four\u201d but that belies the fact that the participation rate is headed back to pre-Great Recession rates.\n\nWe often warn readers to be wary of figures offered out of context. Miller can point to BLS data, but that does not mean his startling figure is actually significant to the debate over immigration. Most of the people who he says are not \u201cemployed\u201d have no interest in being in the workforce in the first place. President Trump once took this notion to an absurd conclusion by citing 92 million \u201cjobless Americans.\u201d Miller does not go that far, but it\u2019s still a nonsense factoid.", "lang": "en"}
