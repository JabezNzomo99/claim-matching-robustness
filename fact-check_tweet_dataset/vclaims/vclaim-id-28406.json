{"title": "Can the $20 Bill Be Folded to Spell 'Trump'?", "subtitle": "You could no doubt fold the bill into several different words.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2019-12-17T09:32:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-28406", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/20-dollar-bill-folds-spells-trump/", "vclaim": "In December 2019, social media users shared a meme containing a picture that purported to demonstrate a $20 bill could be folded to spell the last name of U.S. President Donald Trump in a \u201chidden\u201d message.\n\n \n\n The photograph is misleading for several reasons. For starters, the $20 bill doesn\u2019t have lettering in the area where the bill is folded to spell out \u201cTrump.\u201d\n\n \n\n Instead, it appears that one or more $1 bills were folded inside the $20 to give the illusion:\n\n \n\n Because the letter \u201cP\u201d does not appear in the phrase \u201cThe United States of America\u201d on the $1 bill, someone apparently used a marker to turn a \u201cD\u201d into a \u201cP\u201d in order to finish spelling \u201cTrump\u201d in the meme.\n\nAnd finally, anything with lettering on it that can be folded can be used to create whatever \u201chidden messages\u201d the letters allow.\n\nWe therefore rate this claim \u201cFalse\u201d because the picture in the meme is misleadingly manipulated to make it appear \u201cTrump\u201d can be spelled by folding a single $20 bill, thus it is not a \u201chidden message\u201d embedded in currency that was in circulation well before Trump\u2019s presidency.", "lang": "en"}
