She makes a on the treasurer\u2019s website.\n\nWe decided to check her claim on those claims.\n\nThe Crime Victim Compensation Program pays grants to Rhode Island crime victims or their family members. Awards can be used to help pay for expenses such as health insurance deductibles, medical care, lost wages, mental health therapy, crime scene cleanup or funeral costs. Individual victims often file more than one claim, but the maximum amount any one person can receive is $25,000.\n\nMost of the program\u2019s money comes from fines and assessments levied in the state courts, augmented by federal funds.\n\nWhen we asked Raimondo\u2019s office for backup, her staff provided a breakdown of the unresolved claim backlog that they said they found after sorting through the compensation program\u2019s files when she took office in 2011.\n\nIt comprised 912 claims by 415 people. The names of the individuals and the doctors or health care providers who were paid were redacted from the documents we received.\n\nTreasurer\u2019s office spokeswoman Joy Fox said fund staffers began going through the paperwork in the files around the middle of 2011, finishing around November. During that time they found instances in which claims had been filed but not decided, and others in which claims had been approved but not paid.\n\nThe accounting listed the date that each backlogged claim was filed, how much was sought, when it was approved or denied, how much was awarded if it had been approved, when the check was issued and the check number. The earliest claim went back to 2007.\n\nAfter the list was compiled, Fox said the effort to resolve them began in January 2012. According to the payment accounting from Raimondo\u2019s office, by June of 2012 about 95 percent of the claims had resolved. The remainder, 47 claims, were finished by December 2012. Since then, the average wait time for a new claim to be resolved is 28.9 days, the treasurer\u2019s office said in its on the program to the General Assembly.\n\nOf the 912 claims, 391 were approved for some kind of award, about 43 percent. The total amount paid out on those came to $681,890.67.\n\nWe wanted to find independent verification of that figure.\n\nSo we went to the treasurer\u2019s office online \"transparency portal,\" which lists the checks issued by the state in given fiscal years. We looked for the 391 checks on the backlog list and found 310 matches -- enough to give us confidence in Raimondo\u2019s figure.\n\nFox said the rest don\u2019t show individually on the transparency portal because the state consolidates multiple payments to single health care service providers into a single combined number for each payee.\n\nGina Raimondo said her office was able to resolve 900 pending claims from the state\u2019s Crime Victim Compensation Program since she became general treasurer in 2011.\n\nHer staff provided an accounting that outlined the effort. It showed 912 claims resolved, 12 more than she said. We independently verified enough of the claims to rule her statement .", "lang": "en"}
