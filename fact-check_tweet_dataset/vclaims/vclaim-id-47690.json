The appears to be writhing on the ground in distress.\n\n\n\nA keyword search on Facebook for \"Corona Patient Outside Hospital in India\" led us to more such posts on several pages.\n\nCaptions cautioning people saying, \"Corona Patient In Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. Be Alert, stay home and stay safe,\" was found on a Facebook page called, 'Bodoland Culture North East India'. The post has over 11,000 views and over 150 shares.\n\nThe video was also shared by 'Malwa News' which claims to Punjabi news portal accompanying the text \"Corona Patient increased in India. Hospital potion is not good\".\n\nThe same video was also shared extensively on Twitter.\n\nThe video is not of a COVID-19 patient.\n\nBreaking the video into multiple frames using the digital verification tool InVid, we could identify the hospital hoarding \"\u092e\u093e\u0924\u0943 \u0936\u093f\u0936\u0941 \u091a\u093f\u0915\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0938\u093e\u0932\u092f \u0915\u093e\u0928\u092a\u0941\u0930\" (Pediatric treatment centre, Kanpur). We can also see \"Corona Virus Isolation Ward\" written on it in Hindi, which may have led to people assuming the person seen in the video is a COVID-19 infected patient.\n\nThrough a reverse image search on Google, we were able to connect the building to Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial (GSVM) Medical College in Kanpur.\n\n\n\nOn searching YouTube with keywords such as, \"GSVM, Corona Medical School Kanpur,\" a 'NewsUP-78' video report published on March 31, 2020, was discovered. The report contained a rebuttal by Dr Aarti Dave Lalchandani, Principal and Dean of GSVM Medical College.\n\nIn the video, the dean claims, \"the person shown in the video is an epileptic patient who was having an attack. He was accidentally taken to the Corona Ward. During a seizure, you mustn't try to hold them down or stop their movements.- Once it reduced, he was treated in the emergency ward and was later sent home. The video was falsely linked to COVID-19 pandemic. (translated from Hindi)\" \n\n\n\nThe absence of standard PPE kits used to treat COVID-19 patients and the lack of social distancing around the patient further contradict the claims made about the video.\n\n\n\nTherefore, given the evidence, it can be ascertained the video falsely claims to show COVID-19 infected person in distress.\n\nMisinformation and rumours surrounding infectious diseases can lead to unjustified panic and chaos, which would deter our fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343\n\nAlso Read: Fact Check: No, Ratan Tata Did Not Say Indian Economy Will Bounce Back Post COVID-19 Pandemic", "lang": "en"}
