Sila dapat ay pansamantala ng palayain. Hahayaan na lang ba natin sila magkasakit sa kulungan (What about the prisoners? They should be temporarily freed. Will we just allow them to get sick in prison)?\u201d\n\nThe fabricated post features an edited copy of a graphic that News5 published on March 17 on its official FB page based on a quote from Robredo's public address aired on her FB page that day where she spoke about social distancing. She made no call to free prisoners.\n\nThe original quote card had Robredo saying: \u201cProtect the vulnerable and we protect the whole. Kaisa ako sa panawagan ni Pangulong Duterte na sumunod sa (I am one with President Duterte\u2019s call to follow) social distancing measures. Ngunit hindi pwedeng iwanan na lang ang mga maralita para asikasuhin ang sarili nila (However, we cannot just leave the poor to fend for themselves).\u201d\n\nThe fake post was published two days after Robredo\u2019s address was released, where she also gave the public an update on her fundraiser to provide personal protective equipment for health workers.\n\nIt received over 60 reactions and 131 shares on FB.\n\nVERA Files Fact Check debunked last week two other fabricated quote cards concerning Robredo, which manipulated a graphic from News5 and GMA News Online.", "lang": "en"}
