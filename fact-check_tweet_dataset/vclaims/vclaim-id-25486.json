According to Dainik Bhaskar, the incident occurred in Panchkula sector-19, Haryana. A case was lodged against the father, Gurmeet Singh, by the grandfather of the children who said that his daughter and son-in-law were not getting along. The couple stayed separately. On May 16, when the grandfather was returning home after picking up the kids from school, Singh came with two other men and kidnapped his children.\n\nThe incident was also reported by Amar Ujalawhich said that Gurpreet Singh and his wife had filed for divorce. The report added that the police were on the lookout for the accused on the basis of the CCTV footage.\n\nThe video was earlier debunked by Vishwas News.\n\nThus, an old case where a father kidnapped his children who were staying with their mother, is being used on social media for fear-mongering. The incident did not take place in Indore, MP but in Haryana. With child-kidnapping rumours on a rise, irresponsible posts on social media might add to the panic.", "lang": "en"}
