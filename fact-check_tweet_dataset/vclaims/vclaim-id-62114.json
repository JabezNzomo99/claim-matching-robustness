The post, which has been shared from multiple pages, says that because of this every, municipality is trying to inflate COVID-19 positive figures.\n\nFacebook posts can be seen here, here and here.\n\nNewsMobile fact checked the post and found the claim to be false.\n\nWe ran a Google search but did not find any reliable report on this.\n\nWe then scanned through the website of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and their social media pages to gain more information regarding the same.\n\nWhile investigating, we came across a tweet by the Press Information Bureau (PIB) clarifying that NO such scheme has been launched by the government.\n\nIn July, NewsMobile debunked similar fake news, where a fake audio message making a similar claim regarding Rs 1.5 lakh being set aside by government went viral in the name of Geeta Jain, an independent member of the Legislative Assembly of Mira Bhayandar in Maharashtra.\n\nThe above fact-check establishes that the post in question is fake.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
