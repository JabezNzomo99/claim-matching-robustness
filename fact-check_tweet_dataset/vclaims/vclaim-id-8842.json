Trump now says he\u2019s a political trendsetter, claiming Bernie Sanders and then \u201ceverybody\u201d followed his lead and started using the word \u201crigged\u201d too. That\u2019s false.\n\nOur review of public statements suggests Trump borrowed the word from Sanders, who regularly has used the term \u201crigged\u201d to describe the government systems that institutionalize income inequality. That has been a Sanders theme since day one of his campaign \u2014 long before Trump made the word a regular staple of his stump speeches.\n\nIn fact, populist politicians have been using the term \u201crigged\u201d for decades to describe various government or political systems \u2013 despite Trump\u2019s claim that a couple \u201cpolitical pros\u201d told him that he was a trailblazer in using the word \u201crigged.\u201d\n\nBefore we dig into the political uses of \u201crigged,\u201d though, let\u2019s set the scene with Trump\u2019s odd boast, made during a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, on July 5 after the FBI director announced that he would not recommend criminal charges against Clinton for her use of a private email server when she served as secretary of state.\n\n\u201cToday is the best evidence ever that we\u2019ve seen that our system is absolutely, totally rigged,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s rigged.\u201d\n\nTrump then went on to say that he was the first to use the term \u201crigged\u201d in the Republican primaries, in reference to his displeasure with not being awarded delegates proportional to his vote tally in some states. Then \u201call of a sudden,\u201d he said \u201crigged\u201d became \u201ca hot term.\u201d People like Sanders started using it, Trump said, and \u201cnow everyone talks about \u2018rigged.'\u201d\n\nTrump in North Carolina, July 5: And I used that term initially when I was running in the Republican primaries and I was the first to use it. Then all of a sudden it became a hot term. Everybody was using the word, \u201crigged, rigged, rigged.\u201d But if you remember, I\u2019d win Louisiana and I\u2019d find out I\u2019d be getting enough delegates, what happens? And places like Colorado which were so good to me, but all of a sudden we find out that they don\u2019t have the vote. And other things. OK. I used the word great. And frankly I\u2019ll be honest. If I didn\u2019t win in landslides I wouldn\u2019t be standing up here. You\u2019d be watching some politician who would lose to Hillary Clinton. OK? Believe me. Believe me. I started winning \u2014 I learned about rigged very fast. I learned. But I used the term \u201crigged.\u201d Then all of a sudden Bernie started using it and other people and now everyone talks about \u201crigged\u201d but I\u2019m gonna keep using it because I was the one that brought it up and I\u2019m the one, and I asked a couple of political pros, \u201cDid you ever hear the word rigged, it\u2019s a rigged everything?\u201d And they really \u2014 it hasn\u2019t been a thing used, I guess it has to be somewhere along the line, but it hasn\u2019t.\n\nTrump mentioned it again the next day during a speech in Cincinnati.\n\nWe realize there are bigger issues being discussed on the campaign trail. But when Trump claimed that \u201cI\u2019m the one that brought that word up\u201d and that \u201cnow everybody\u2019s using it,\u201d we wondered if that could possibly be true.\n\nLess than two months after announcing his presidential candidacy in June 2015, Trump got some written advice from his longtime adviser Roger Stone. As the Washington Post reported on Aug. 9, 2015, \u201cIn a 13-page memo to Trump, Stone urged him to state that \u2018the system is rigged against the citizens\u2019 and that he is the lone candidate \u2018who cannot be bought.'\u201d\n\nBut we couldn\u2019t find any evidence that Trump actually took that advice \u2014 at least not by literally using the word \u201crigged\u201d \u2014 until the following April, when Trump began to criticize the Republican primary system \u2014 as well as the Democratic primary system, on behalf of Sanders. Trump was concerned that delegate counts were not matching popular vote counts in some states.\n\nAt a rally in Albany, New York, on April 11, for example, Trump railed against the Republican primary process, calling it a \u201crigged, disgusting dirty system.\u201d Later that month, at a rally in Indiana, Trump called the Republican primary process \u201ca rigged, crooked system that\u2019s designed so that the bosses can pick whoever they want.\u201d\n\nIn June, Trump described the political system more broadly as \u201ctotally rigged in order to keep [incumbent politicians] in power.\u201d\n\nIn a June 22 speech in New York City, Trump used the word seven times in just over a minute to describe not just the political system, but the whole economy.\n\nTrump, June 22: We\u2019ll will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who have rigged it in the first place. The insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money. That\u2019s why we\u2019re asking Bernie Sanders\u2019 voters to join our movement: so together we can fix the system for all Americans. So important. This includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals. \u2026 Because it\u2019s not just the political system that\u2019s rigged, it\u2019s the whole economy. It\u2019s rigged by big donors who want to keep wages down. It\u2019s rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the United States with absolutely no consequences for them. It\u2019s rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools. It\u2019s rigged against you, the American people.\n\nMore recently, as we noted earlier, Trump has used the word \u201crigged\u201d to describe the justice system that decided not to prosecute Clinton for her use of a private email system when she served as secretary of state.\n\nSo there\u2019s no question Trump has embraced \u201crigged everything\u201d in his speeches and interviews. But is he responsible for introducing the term into the current political discourse? Hardly.\n\nWe did word searches on speeches by Trump catalogued by Project Vote Smart and did a Lexis Nexis search of all newspaper articles using the words \u201cTrump\u201d and \u201crigged.\u201d We didn\u2019t find any evidence of Trump using the word \u201crigged\u201d from the beginning of his campaign in June 2015 until April 2016, when it became a regular feature in his speeches.\n\nSanders, on the other hand, regularly used the term \u201crigged\u201d to describe the U.S. economy even before Trump entered the race and before Stone advised Trump to use the word \u201crigged\u201d to describe \u201cthe system.\u201d In his announcement speech on May 26, 2015, Sanders talked about income inequality and said, \u201cThis type of rigged economy is not what America is supposed to be about.\u201d\n\nProject Vote Smart documents at least 40 instances of Sanders using the term \u201crigged\u201d in speeches and interviews between the first day of his candidacy and Trump\u2019s initial use of the term in April 2016. From the start, Sanders\u2019 campaign website included a page on \u201cIncome and Wealth Inequality\u201d and concludes, \u201cThis is what a rigged economic system looks like.\u201d It was one of the central themes of Sanders\u2019 campaign.\n\nAlthough Trump claimed to have introduced \u201crigged\u201d to the Republican primary, he didn\u2019t. During a Republican primary debate in January, Carly Fiorina criticized the \u201cestablishment,\u201d the media and pundits, saying, \u201cThe game is rigged.\u201d That same month, John Kasich similarly claimed the \u201csystem is rigged.\u201d\n\nBut let\u2019s go back a little further, before the 2016 campaign. In a major speech at the Democratic convention in 2012, Sen. Elizabeth Warren famously said, \u201cPeople feel like the system is rigged against them. And here\u2019s the painful part: They\u2019re right. The system is rigged.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s public statements archived by Project Vote Smart since January 2012 show the Massachusetts senator has used the term frequently over the last five years.\n\nBut we can go back even further than that. Trump may take credit for introducing the term \u201crigged\u201d to describe the primary process, but that\u2019s exactly the word Jerry Brown used in 1992 to describe that very system.\n\nOther random examples of elected officials using the term rigged on the House or Senate floor over the years can be found here and here and here and here and here and here. We could go on. But the point is that politicians have long been using the term rigged to describe government and political systems for years and years.\n\nTrump may have a newfound affection for the word. But he didn\u2019t introduce it into the political discourse. It was already there.", "lang": "en"}
