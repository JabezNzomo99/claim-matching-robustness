But it's not all it's cracked up to be.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-02-21T08:00:42Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-3015", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/02/21/are-senate-republicans-killing-blue-slip-for-court-nominees/", "vclaim": "When it was under Democratic control, the Senate in 2013 ended the ability of opponents to filibuster trial and appellate court nominations (and presidential appointments); previously, it required 60 votes to invoke cloture and end debate, allowing for a vote on a nominee. Republicans, after they took control, ended the ability to filibuster Supreme Court nominations in 2017. Nominees can now be confirmed with a simple majority of 51 votes.\n\nOnce the president submits a judicial nomination to the Senate, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee sends a blue-colored form (or \u201cblue slip\u201d) to both senators from the nominee\u2019s home state. Those senators have the option of returning the blue slip with a positive or negative response; they may also choose to withhold the blue slip. A positive response means \u201call good\u201d and a negative or withheld blue slip means there\u2019s an objection.\n\nThe most recent Democratic chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (Vt.), had a policy that no judicial nominee could get a hearing if a home-state senator withheld a blue slip or sent it back negative. This could kill a nomination, because the full Senate does not vote on nominees unless they\u2019ve been approved by the Judiciary Committee. Leahy was chairman from 2001 to 2003 and from 2007 to 2015.\n\nSen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) had not returned a positive blue slip for Brennan. Baldwin said a bipartisan group that vets judicial and prosecutorial candidates, the Wisconsin Federal Nominating Commission, had not signed off on Brennan\u2019s nomination. [Update: Grassley also held a hearing for David Stras, who was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, on Jan. 3. At the time, then-Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) had not returned a positive blue slip for Stras.]\n\nFoy added that the blue slip was not used as often before 2013, because it was more common to block nominees with the filibuster. Foy said Grassley\u2019s blue-slip policy is like Biden\u2019s, who required that the White House consult with home-state senators on each nomination, regardless of the blue-slip situation. Biden, a Democrat, was chairman of the Judiciary Committee from 1987 to 1995.\n\nWhen Sen. Strom Thurmond, a South Carolina Republican, was chairman from 1981 to 1986, the Judiciary Committee \u201cmoved forward on three known nominations that had received one negative blue slip and on one known nomination for which a home state senator had not returned a blue slip,\u201d according to the CRS report. All the objections came from Democratic senators in those cases.\n\n\u201cIn fact, Senator Leahy declined to schedule hearings for six of President Bush\u2019s circuit court nominees for reasons besides lack of positive blue slips,\u201d Grassley said during a Judiciary Committee hearing Nov. 29. \u201cSome of my colleagues and outside groups have criticized me for allegedly abolishing a Senate tradition. As I\u2019ve explained, that\u2019s not true. I\u2019m restoring the traditional policy and practice of the vast majority of my predecessors over the past 100 years.\u201d\n\nBut this tradition has been observed by two of 19 chairmen \u2014 or 32 out of 100 years \u2014 in the history of the Senate Judiciary Committee, according to the Congressional Research Service. Grassley says that he probably will keep requiring two positive blue slips for district court nominees and that he continues to ask that the White House consult with home-state senators for all nominees, regardless of the blue-slip situation.", "lang": "en"}
