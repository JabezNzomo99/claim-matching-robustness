No, that is not true: There were no media reports that a camera monitoring inside Epstein's cell malfunctioned in the hours before the accused sex traffickers death on Saturday August 10, 2019. There were tweets from a political marketing executive. These are not \"reports\" and they offer no sourcing that warrants any legitimate news site to echo the claim.\n\nUpdated August 29, 2019: The Washington Post reported more than two weeks after Epstein's death that some of the video captured by a jail camera in the hallway OUTSIDE the cell was \"unusable,\" but that another camera recorded \"clearer footage\" of the area. Many of the false reports claimed this involved video of what happened inside the cell, but there is no indication a camera was inside the cell. The Post attributed the information to three people who had been briefed on the evidence.\n\n\n\nThe story originated from an article published by BigLeaguePolitics.com on August 10, 2019 titled \"Report: 'Camera Malfunction' in Epstein's Prison Cell Prevented Recording of His Alleged Suicide\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nDoes it get any fishier than this? The reported suicide of Democrat-affiliated sex predator Jeffrey Epstein earlier this morning has journalists and other concerned citizens demanding answers.\n\n\n\nBut they shouldn't expect any to arise soon, if ever, as a report from New Right founder Michael Coudrey indicates that a mysterious camera malfunction has prevented any footage of Epstein's alleged suicide from being captured.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe basis for this story is a tweet posted by marketing executive Michael Coudrey, whose website says he provides \"'digital information warfare' services to political candidates across the country.\" He tweeted \"BREAKING: Alleged 'camera malfunction' last night at MCC where Jeffrey Epstein was locked up.\"\n\nUpdated August 29, 2019: The information from the Washington Post sources (who were not named by the newspaper) supports Coudrey's tweet that there was a \"camera malfunction\" at the MCC. Coudrey told us this in a direct message via Twitter:\n\nLead Stories has lifted the false rating on that tweet, but subsequent tweets by Coudrey did contain information that is disproven by the same reporting that verified his first claim. Contrary to what he wrote, there was clear video of the hallway outside the cell. The Washington Post reported on August 26, 2019:\n\nAt least one camera in the hallway outside the cell where authorities say registered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein hanged himself earlier this month had footage that is unusable, although other, clearer footage was captured in the area, according to three people briefed on the evidence gathered earlier this month.\n\n\n\nIt was not immediately clear why some video footage outside Epstein's cell is too flawed for investigators to use or what is visible in the usable footage. The incident is being investigated by the FBI and the Justice Department's inspector general's office, which are attempting to determine what happened and how to assess whether any policies were violated or crimes committed.\n\nThere are many questions about how Epstein could have hung himself in his cell just two weeks after prison officials announced he had attempted suicide and failed. There is conflicting information about if Epstein was on suicide watch, under which jail guards would check on him frequently. Reuters reports that he was not.\n\nCNN's Justice Department reporter noted in a tweet that the prison confirmed Epstein was in the special housing unit, not where suicide watch is provided:\n\nThe Justice Department released this statement in the hours after Epstein's death:\n\nFormer New York mayor and Trump lawyer Rudy Guiliani expressed his own suspicions about a malfunctioning camera in a tweet Saturday afternoon, but he soon delete the tweet.
