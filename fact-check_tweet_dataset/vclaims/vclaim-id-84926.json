But there\u2019s actually more to the story, and voucher programs across states are difficult to compare because each program is structured differently. Here are the facts.\n\nIndiana\u2019s Choice Scholarship Program was launched in 2011, under Pence\u2019s predecessor, Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels. The voucher program survived a state Supreme Court challenge just after Pence took office in January 2013, and he dramatically expanded the program to increase eligibility for students. The program offers vouchers to low- and middle-income families to attend private schools.\n\nBut some other states have multiple smaller voucher programs, unlike Indiana. When looking at the total number of enrollees across all programs in one state, Ohio has the largest cumulative voucher participation, with 45,459 enrollees. Wisconsin ranks just behind Indiana, but the data are not yet complete because a fourth program is now accepting enrollees. As of 2015, there were 31,295 students enrolled across three programs in Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cWe [in Indiana] do have the largest single voucher program in the country,\u201d Robert Enlow, chief executive of the Friedman Foundation, said. He noted that there is another way to measure this \u2014 the total number of students participating in the program.\n\nEvery voucher program is structured differently and difficult to compare across states, Enlow said. In fact, the reason Indiana\u2019s single program has so many students is that it is designed more broadly than the programs in other states.\n\nFor example, three of Ohio\u2019s four programs are limited to specific groups of students, either by their disability status or by their school district. Ohio has a statewide voucher program but it is limited to students in chronically low-performing public schools, also called \u201cfailing\u201d schools. Ten percent of Ohio\u2019s K-12 students are eligible for this program.\n\nIn comparison, 59 percent of K-12 students in Indiana\u2019s statewide school voucher program are eligible, and over 50 percent of recipients never attended public school prior to getting a voucher. Just 2 percent of children in Indiana\u2019s program come from \u201cfailing\u201d schools, data from the Indiana Department of Education show. There is no cap on the number of vouchers in Indiana\u2019s program, unlike programs in most other states.\n\nTeresa Meredith, president of the Indiana State Teachers Association, noted data from the Indiana Department of Education, criticized Pence\u2019s expansion of the program for going beyond how the program was originally intended.\n\nBy one measure, Pence is correct that Indiana is home to the largest voucher program. Indiana has one voucher program, and it has more students in it than any other single program in the 15 states that offer vouchers. But Ohio has the largest number of students participating in its voucher programs cumulatively; unlike Indiana, Ohio offers four programs that are more narrowly tailored.\n\nMoreover, Indiana\u2019s program is different than most other voucher programs in the country. It is broad-reaching, raised the income cap to include middle class families and does not have the same limitations for students to be from failing schools. Pence makes an apples to oranges comparison by touting his state\u2019s program and thus earns Two Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
