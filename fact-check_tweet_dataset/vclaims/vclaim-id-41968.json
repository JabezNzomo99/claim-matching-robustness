Christmas tree farms take precautions to prevent \"harmless hitchhikers.\" By one estimate, only 1 in 100,000 Christmas trees has a post-harvest pest.\n\nA photograph supposedly showing a praying mantis egg case on the limb of a Christmas tree is frequently shared on social media during the holiday season:\n\nWhile this picture truly shows a praying mantis egg case on a Christmas tree (it was originally posted to Facebook in December 2017), social media posts and news articles about this potential pest problem may have given readers the false impression that this was a common or dangerous occurrence.\n\nChris Enroth, a horticulture educator at the University of Illinois Extension, writes that \u201cthese Christmas tree post-harvest pests (a reference to any insect, not just praying mantis eggs) are rare, occurring in 1 out of 100,000 cut trees.\u201d Doug Hundley, a seasonal spokesperson for the National Christmas Tree Association, also told us that it is \u201cvery rare\u201d to find a mantis egg case on a Christmas tree.\n\nHundley said that Christmas Tree Farms take precautions to reduce the chances of an insect (or \u201charmless hitchhiker\u201d) from making its way from the farm to the home:\n\nMost of these tree growers practice or utilize a pest management system called Integrated Pest Management or IPM. IPM is utilized in most crops now. Christmas tree production began using it about 25 years ago. IPM practices are developed by University research and taught by Extension programs so the growers can successfully manage pest populations in a smart and environmentally friendly way. Using IPM (farmers) scout their Christmas tree plantings regularly for pests that are interfering with the health of the trees and to prevent what we call post-harvest pests or harmless hitchhikers.\n\nAlthough we\u2019ve found a few old anecdotes about mantis eggs being found on Christmas trees (musician Taylor Swift was tasked with finding mantis eggs at her family Christmas tree farm in her childhood), this potential pest problem really started gaining news coverage in 2017. At the time, the pest control company Safer Brand was causing a stir by claiming that \u201cas many as 25,000 bugs can live in one tree.\u201d\n\nEntomologists quickly shot down this claim. Adam Dale, assistant professor for entomology at University of Florida (UF), told MyNews13: \u201cYou are not going to have thousands of bugs in your Christmas trees.\u201d\n\nSusan Haddock, an agent in pest management for the UF Agricultural Extension, added:\n\nWhile there have been a few incidents over the years of people finding mantis eggs on their Christmas trees, this is not a widespread or dangerous problem.", "lang": "en"}
