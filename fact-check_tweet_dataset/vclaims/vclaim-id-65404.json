A week before the Trump rally, it was reported that George Soros and two other hedge fund managers had given a total of $5.5 million to Clinton\u2019s campaign or to super PACs supporting her in August 2016.\n\nBut that\u2019s a long way from $100 million.\n\nIf you think you\u2019ve heard that figure before, perhaps it was from a February 2016 report by the Wall Street Journal. It estimated that since Clinton and former President Bill Clinton entered national politics in the early 1990s, Wall Street has contributed more than $100 million to their political campaigns, charitable foundation and personal finances.\n\nSo, that doesn\u2019t help Trump\u2019s claim.\n\nThe go-to source on this is OpenSecrets.org, the website of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nThe center generally considers \"Wall Street\" and hedge funds to be the securities and investment industry. However, other industries could be added, as well.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t get back to us with evidence to back his claim.\n\nBut we tried to view his claim broadly. We counted contributions to Clinton\u2019s campaign as well as to super PACs that support her. And we counted contributions not only from the securities and investment industry, but also two related industries, as they are categorized by the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nTo be clear: The contributions don\u2019t come from firms. Rather they come from individual employees or members of the organizations, or political action committees tied to the organizations.\n\nHere\u2019s what we found (figures are rounded):\n\nNeedless to say, $64.3 million is well short of $100 million.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting, as the Center for Responsive Politics has reported, that most of the \"Wall Street\" contributions benefiting Clinton \"have come from a tiny group of ultra-wealthy, liberal donors who work in finance. Wall Street more broadly doesn\u2019t have any outsized affection for Clinton, but a relative handful of donors who work in the industry have invested heavily in her.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the corresponding figures for Trump and super PACs backing him total far less than $2 million.\n\nCampaigning outside Milwaukee, Trump said: \"In her campaign for president,\" Clinton \"has received $100 million in contributions from Wall Street and hedge funds.\"\n\nThe gold-standard source on this subject puts the figure at $64 million.", "lang": "en"}
