The claims are being made that the video is of a Tablighi Jamaat member who misbehaved after his demand for Biryani was declined in a quarantine center.\n\nNewsobile fact-checked the viral post and found the claim to be false.\n\nWe extracted the video frames and then ran a reverse search on various search engines. On Yandex, a Russian search engine, we found a link to the same video in inverted colours on YouTube.\n\nThe video was uploaded on Aug 23, 2019, and according to the description, the incident took place in Khalid Bin Waleed mosque in Gulshan-e-Hadid Phase-II, in Karachi, Pakistan.\n\n In the video, the man is also shown entering a mosque.\n\nThe video description also claims that the man was mentally ill and was taken into custody following the incident. \n\n\n\nWe took a screengrab from the above video and color inverted it to find the original video via a website called Invert Image Online.\n\nWe ran a search on Google maps with keywords \u2018Khalid Bin Waleed\u2019 and found a picture of the mosque.\n\nWe then compared that picture to the one that we extracted from the YouTube video and found that they are of the same place.\n\nThe above information proves that the viral video is OLD and NOT from India.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
