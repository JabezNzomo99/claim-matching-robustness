Both rated the Facebook posts that revived a 2009 photo of then senator and now Senate hopeful Mar Roxas on a \u201cpadyak\u201d as misleading.\u2013 Ed.\n\nBy the University of the Philippines Journalism Department (Tuesday, March 19, 2019)\n\nA viral Facebook post misleads readers by taking out of context an old Mar Roxas photo.\n\nOn March 13, Facebook page Think the Brighter Side of Life posted a photo of Senate hopeful Roxas riding a padyak (cycle rickshaw) with the caption:\n\nThe photo was taken during the runup to the 2010 elections, not 2019 as the Facebook post suggests.\n\nIt was uploaded in a Mar Roxas Flickr account with the caption:\n\nLiberal President Sernator [sic] Mar Roxas flashes the thumbs up sign as he rides a padyak, which has become the symbol of his advocacies for a better life among Filipinos, along Fabella Street in downtown Naga City before attending a forum of an urban poor group hosted by Mayor Jesse Robredo (right). Robredo, a Ramon Magsaysay Awardee, told his constituents he is supporting Roxas' bid to become the country's next President in 2010.\n\nRoxas, then a senator, was earlier the Liberal Party standard bearer in the 2010 presidential race but gave way to Benigno Simeon Aquino III in 2009.\n\nAquino subsequently won the presidency; Roxas lost the vice presidential race to Jejomar Binay.\n\nA September 2009 post by blogger Tonyo Cruz published the same photo and credited it to the website marroxas.com.\n\nRobredo, mentioned in the caption and seen with Roxas in another photo of the same event posted on the Flickr account, died in a plane crash in 2012.\n\nThe misleading Facebook post has been shared more than 3,500 times, and has more than 550 comments, mostly critical of Roxas but a few pointing out the photo is old based on how he looks.\n\nCruz, T. (2009, September 21). Transcript: Mar Roxas accepts offer to be Noynoy Aquino\u2019s runningmate [Blog post]. Retrieved from https://tonyocruz.com/?p=2392\n\nAt least 43 pages and public groups on Facebook (FB) carried an identical misleading post featuring a nine-year-old photo of senate hopeful Manuel \u201cMar\u201d Roxas II.\n\nThe old picture of Roxas driving a \u201cpadyak\u201d or pedicab was published, shared and re-shared in March 2018 and between March 8 and March 19 of this year.\n\nCrowdtangle, a social media monitoring tool, shows at least five FB pages were the main sources of these posts:\n\u2022 Snap, Don\u2019t Me and Time News Information, which gave the image this same caption:\n\u2022 Think The Brighter Side of Life, which wrote:\n\nA reverse image search shows Roxas\u2019 photo was taken in Naga City, Camarines Sur \u201cbefore attending a forum of an urban poor group.\u201d The late Interior Secretary and Naga City mayor Jesse Robredo hosted the event. Robredo endorsed Roxas\u2019 2010 presidential bid before the latter withdrew from the race.\n\nAn article by Vox Bikol, an English-language newspaper published in Naga City, places the date Roxas rode the padyak at Aug. 15, 2009.\n\nThe views and information in \u2018Tsek.ph\u2019 are those of their respective authors and owners and do not reflect the official policy or position of the media and academic partners of Tsek.ph.", "lang": "en"}
