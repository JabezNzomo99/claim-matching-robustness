Upon enquiry, I also found out that she had married a Jain. Islam states that a Muslim can only marry a Muslim.\"\n\n\"I am just conveying to the media what the Sharia states,\" he added.\n\nThe story did not mention issuing of fatwa against Jahan, nor did it mention the involvement of Darul Uloom Deoband.\n\nHowever, when News18 Hindi reported on this matter, they added a new fact - that a fatwa had been issued against Jahan by a \"Deoband Maulvi\".\n\nDarul Uloom Deoband is a prominent Islamic University in India, and is the birthplace of the Deobandi Islamic Movement in 1867. Darul Uloom Deoband has been in the limelight in the past for issuing controversial fatwas.\n\nIn 2010, the institute issued a fatwa that barred woman from working in the same space as men. In 2012, the Deobandi officials drew controversy for opposing the visit of writer Salman Rushdie to India, as they claimed that his works had hurt Islamic sentiments. In 2013, another fatwa was issued by the institute to ban photography as un-Islamic.\n\nA story by news channel Times Now included the fatwa, while using the same quote Qasmi had given to ABP News Hindi. Times Now on June 29 tweeted, \"Days after newly elected TMC MP Nusrat Jahan applied sindoor and wore Mangalsutra for the swearing-in ceremony, Deoband clerics have issued a fatwa to the actor turned neta and said that Muslim marry only Muslims\"\n\nBOOM watched the entire video of the segment - which also carried a video recording of Qasmi's statement - and found no mention of a fatwa anywhere in Qasmi's quote.\n\nQasmi said, \"She (Jahan) can do whatever she wants. I do not want to interfere with her life in anyway. I'm just conveying what the Sharia states.\"\n\nZee News also ran a similar story, where they claimed that \"Deoband clerics have issued a fatwa against Jahan\", which included Qasmi's opinion on Jahan's marriage to business man Nikhil Jain.\n\nWhile Zee News led the story by stating that a fatwa was issued against Jahan, they did not mention any details about the fatwa, or by whom it was issued, in the rest of the story.\n\nThe News Indian Express in a story published on the evening on June 29, carried a headline, \"Fatwa-loving Dar-ul-Uloom objects to TMC MP Nusrat Jahan's marriage to non-Muslim\".\n\nWhile The New Indian Express does not directly mention the issuing of fatwa against Jahan, it describes the university as \"fatwa-loving\" and \"always in the limelight over its \u2018fatwas\u2019.\n\nAccording to The New Indian Express, clerics at Darul Uluum Deoband had objected to Jahan's wedding. However, the story contains no statement from any university official, but has the same quote by Qasmi given to ABP Hindi and misreported by Times Now and Zee News.\n\nIs Qasmi a member of the Darul Uloom?\n\n\"Not at all, he (Mufti Asad Qasmi) is not affiliated to our institution in anyway,\" claimed Ashraf Usmani, incharge of media relations at Darul Uloom.\n\nThe only thing that Qasmi and the university have in common is that they're both based out of Deoband.\n\nUsmani also stated that Darul Uloom was in no way involved in commenting on Jahan's wedding or issuing a fatwa against her. \"We condemn such fake news being reported by the media to create false impressions,\" Usmani added.\n\nThis has been debunked earlier by fact checking website Alt News.", "lang": "en"}
