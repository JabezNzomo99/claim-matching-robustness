The photo in question has been shared over 20,000 times.\n\nOne post has accompanying text claiming to explain the science behind it:\n\nAlthough alcoholic hand sanitisers are potentially flammable, there would need to be a spark to start a fire at temperatures this low. The flammable ingredients in hand sanitiser would need to be at much higher temperatures, over 350\u00b0C, to combust without a spark.\n\nTo be safe, you should store them out of the heat, and away from open flames, sparks and hot surfaces though.\n\nWhat is the flash point?\n\nThe flash point is the lowest temperature at which a substance can give off vapour into the air around it, which can be ignited by a spark or other source of ignition.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the flash point of antibacterial gels is around 21\u00b0C. In the UK, Dettol antibacterial hand gel has a flash point of 24\u00b0C, and Carex antibacterial hand gels have flash points of between 22\u00b0C and 23\u00b0C.\n\nAt these temperatures hand gel can release vapour that is flammable. So it\u2019s true that alcoholic hand sanitisers are potentially flammable at these temperatures, but they\u2019ll need an external source of ignition to catch fire.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean hand sanitiser left in a car that gets warmer than this will ignite on its own, unless there is a spark.\n\nThe auto-ignition temperature is much higher than this\n\nThe temperature needed to make a substance ignite spontaneously, so without a spark or source of ignition, is the auto-ignition temperature.\n\nWe spoke to Dettol, which told us the auto-ignition temperature for ethanol, the main ingredient in its alcohol hand sanitiser product, was 363\u00b0C, although that can vary by a few degrees either side.\n\nSo that\u2019s much higher than 35\u00b0C, which is the temperature one post says the car in the image got to.\n\nIs the picture what it says it is?\n\nWe don\u2019t know if the car door in the image was the result of a fire caused by hand sanitiser.\n\nThe picture was first investigated in Brazil by fact checker Estad\u00e3o in April, and the image does seem to have some Portuguese writing in the background, but they were not able to verify whether the picture really showed the aftermath of a fire caused by hand sanitiser.", "lang": "en"}
