A few states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and West Bengal include reservation for Muslims under the Other Backward Classes category. Inexplicably, since 2013, the National Crimes Records Bureau annual report has ceased reporting the level of Muslim representation in the police.\u201d\n\nThis report also found that \u201cWomen make up just 7% of the police (Bureau of Police Research and Development, Jan 2017). Over 5 years, 31 states and UTs have improved women\u2019s representation in the force. The pace, however, is much too slow.\u201d The infographic below shows the time Indian States will take to reach 33% women representation in the police.", "lang": "en"}
