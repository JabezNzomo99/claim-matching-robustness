The video shows Pathan waving at a crowd from a moving vehicle.\n\n\n\nThe original audio of the clip has been overlaid with a song titled 'Pakistan Zindabad' by Sahir Ali Bagga.\n\nPathan is seen being accompanied with Madan Mitra, former sports minister of West Bengal and Trinamool Congress leader. A location tag on the clip shows that it was recorded in Shaheen Bagh, Okhla, New Delhi.\n\nDelhi's Shaheen Bagh has been witnessing a unique sit-in demonstration led by women, against the new Citizenship law. On Saturday, a gunman, who identified himself as Kapil Gujjar, opened fire at the protesters. Gujjar has since been taken into custody.\n\nThe viral posts are shared with a Hindi caption, that translates to, \"One more lion has arrived at Saheen Bagh, His name is Irfan Pathan.\"\n\nThe clip had been viewed more than 3 lakh times at the time of writing this article. It is viral on Facebook with the same caption. \n\n\n\nUpon relevant keyword searches on Facebook, we came across a post on the official page of Mitra, which announced the arrival of Pathan for a local cricket tournament on January 14 this year in Kamarhati, North 24 Parganas. Titled the Cricket Premier Knock Out Tournament, the competition felicitated Pathan, who retired from all forms of cricket, earlier this year.", "lang": "en"}
