But there were negotiations and many more votes to come, with the outcome in doubt.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-11-21T08:00:30.976Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-86168", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/11/21/recurring-gop-myth-about-john-mccains-no-obamacare-repeal/", "vclaim": "As anyone who has taken basic civics knows, the House of Representatives and the Senate must pass the same law before it is presented to the president for his signature. If the two bodies pass different versions of a similar law \u2014 as is often the case \u2014 negotiators must meet to hammer out an agreement, known as a conference report.\n\nCurrently, states and the federal government share in the cost of Medicaid, but the proposed laws would have capped federal funding per enrollee. There were differences in how each body would have calculated the caps, but the net result is that federal spending on Medicaid would have dropped significantly \u2014 $772 billion over 10 years in the BCRA and $834 billion in the AHCA.\n\nThat was too much for many senators, and Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) introduced an amendment that would have restored $100 billion of Medicaid funding. But even after that was added, the BCRA was rejected by the Senate by a vote of 43 to 57, including \u201cno\u201d votes from nine Republicans.\n\nFinally, there was a vote on \u201cskinny repeal.\u201d This would have repealed the individual and employer mandates but it would have left much of the rest of the law intact, including Medicaid expansion. In other words, this would not have put any cap on Medicaid spending. This is the bill that McCain, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) voted against, along with all Democrats, so it only had 49 votes.\n\nEven if it had passed, the differences between the AHCA and the skinny repeal would have been stark and perhaps insurmountable. Given the votes on the floor, Senate negotiators would not have been empowered to accept a major cap on Medicaid spending \u2014 and if the bill included that, it probably would have gone down in defeat in the Senate. (Similarly, a bill without a cap on Medicaid spending might have lost conservative votes in the House.) McCain had said he voted against the skinny repeal because he wanted the legislation to go through a regular committee process, so a jammed-together conference process might not have won him over.\n\n\u201cOne reality about conference committees is that, technical restrictions aside, they can accept or reject almost any provision. So it is at least possible that if the bill had gone to conference, they might\u2019ve been able to add that provision,\u201d said Norman Ornstein, congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cI would be dubious that the Senate conferees, knowing the unpopularity of the provision, would have gone along.\u201d\n\nLauren Fine, a spokeswoman for Scalise, insisted that it was possible that the Medicaid provision could have survived if the bill had gone to conference. \u201cThe Medicaid provision was in the House-passed AHCA bill,\u201d she said. \u201cThe McCain \u2018no\u2019 vote ended the possibility of going to conference, where that provision would have been part of the negotiations on melding the House and Senate versions.\u201d\n\nWhen we expressed doubt on that outcome, she responded: \u201cYou have no idea how a conference committee would have absolutely turned out, and that Whip Scalise is certainly as informed as anyone else to speculate what would or would not be decided in conference committee.\u201d\n\nSo at a minimum, it is misleading to say that the Obamacare repeal was just one vote short, as Trump often does. But in the case of the specific Medicaid provision touted by Scalise, it was 17 votes short even with a $100 billion sweetener. There\u2019s a slim possibility some sort of Medicaid funding reduction would have emerged if there had been a conference agreement, but nothing of the size \u2014 $800 billion \u2014 claimed by Scalise.", "lang": "en"}
