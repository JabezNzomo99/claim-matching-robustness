And almost immediately Twitter users and Omar responded, noting the video Pierson had shared wasn\u2019t from Gaza at all. So, what\u2019s going on here? Let\u2019s dig in (and don\u2019t miss our video above).\n\nBy the time an uneasy cease-fire settled over the border on May 6, four Israelis and at least 25 Palestinians were dead in what was the worst round of fighting between Israel and militant factions in Gaza since 2014. Militants in Gaza fired more than 600 rockets into Israel, and Israelis responded with airstrikes on hundreds of targets in Gaza, which brought multistory buildings tumbling to the ground and included a targeted assassination.\n\nA quick Google search made it clear the same video has been widely circulated on the Internet, incorrectly representing conflict zones in several different countries, including Iraq, Ukraine and Russia. Pierson said she had found the video on YouTube but declined to provide a link. (We did not find any version of this video, aside from Pierson\u2019s tweet, that in any way suggested it was filmed in Israel or Gaza.)\n\nA reverse image search did lead to several versions of the video \u2014 many of which claimed to be in Russia or Ukraine. A YouTube video from 2014 showed the same smoke plumes and tree formations as Pierson\u2019s video. The caption on that video identified the weapons system being shown as the BM-21 Grad.\n\nA search of videos for the \u2018BM 21 GRAD\u2019 led to a video from Belarus\u2019s military TV that showed a different military drill from a different angle but that clearly took place in the same location. The caption identified it as the Polessky firing range. But where is that range? After all, just because a military TV network says it\u2019s one place doesn\u2019t mean that is the case.\n\nAfter pushback online, Pierson responded to her tweet, saying the video was simply meant to illustrate what \u201chundreds of rockets look like.\u201d But the video fails as a representation. The artillery shells shown in the video are ordered and rhythmic; the footage is clean and stable. Rockets fired in Israel and Gaza that weekend had none of these characteristics.\n\nAric Toler, a researcher for Bellingcat who first identified this location as Belarus, pointed out that this kind of misuse is common. \u201cThis happens constantly with every conflict. We have recycled footage being passed around back and forth.\u201d He pointed out that the footage \u201csometimes [is] not even [from] conflicts.\u201d It can be something as simple as an airsoft game filmed in a particular way.\n\n\u201cThe onus should fall a lot more on journalists and big-picture, high-user Twitter people\u201d to check where the media they posted originates, Toler said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is really something that should be the responsibility of the average person.\u201d\n\nPierson told The Fact Checker in an email the \u201ctweet does not claim that it is actual footage.\" But there is nothing in her original tweet to give a viewer this cue. Rather, it\u2019s the opposite. She posted a video of rockets, with a caption about rockets, without clarifying they were not the same rockets. When The Fact Checker pointed this out, she replied, \u201cI\u2019m not a reporter, it\u2019s not my job to tweet hard news.\u201d\n\nDeciphering the true location of video, particularly from a conflict zone, isn\u2019t always easy. But a simple Google search would have told her that this video probably wasn\u2019t from May 2019 or from Gaza. If the video was meant as a representation, as she claimed, she should have said as much sooner and then removed the video from her original tweet. Instead, the misleading video she posted gained more than a million views.", "lang": "en"}
