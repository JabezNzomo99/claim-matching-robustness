At the time, prostitution and drug trade were common in and around the park.\n\nAfter community meetings and input from neighbors, the Conservancy -- along with the Philadelphia Department of Parks and Recreation -- presented a master plan for the park in October 2009 that outlined two new playgrounds, a community garden and farmers market, new tennis courts and youth tennis programming, as well as a renovated football and soccer field.\n\nOne of the most visible changes, though, was 64 lights placed around the park, which Holscher said residents wanted to curb illegal activity and violence.\n\n\"This project for us was a little bit of a game changer,\" she said. \"We\u2019ve started to look at parks and how they are tied to healthy eating, healthy living and violence prevention.\"\n\nHolscher said the $4.5 million Hunting Park capital projects and programming was funded through both public and private funds. In addition to that, another $500,000 was added through grants and corporate donations, bringing the total amount for phase one of the revitalization to some $5 million.\n\nAfter efforts to spruce up the park started in 2010, Conservancy staff started hearing from community members that it seemed like crime in the area had slowed, but an analysis wasn\u2019t completed until 2014. That year, Amanda Vandenburg, then a researcher at Dickinson College in Carlisle, was interested in how parks influence communities.\n\nVandenburg said she analyzed public data from the Philadelphia Police Department and charted crime statistics from 2006, before the revitalization efforts began, through 2013, when the first phase of the project had wrapped up. The data included both part I crimes (violent crimes like homicide, rape and aggravated assault) and part II crimes (like simple assault, prostitution, drug possession and other non-violent offenses.)\n\nShe mapped instances of crime from inside and a half-mile buffer around the park, and found that there was a spike in crime between 2006 and 2007. After that point, crime began decreasing in 2008 citywide as police enforcement efforts in Philadelphia changed under a new mayoral administration.\n\nBut crime continued to go down near Hunting Park. Between 2009 and 2013, \"there was an 89 percent drop in the number of crimes,\" according to Vandenburg\u2019s study. Rape and theft from vehicle crime incidents increased over that time period, but other crimes decreased, including prostitution and drug use.\n\nVandenburg also conducted a \"hot spot\" analysis that showed areas predicted to have the highest amounts of crime were closer to and in the park in 2009 and moved away from the park by 2013.\n\nWhile she said the revitalization of Hunting Park can\u2019t be attributed as the only reason for a decrease in crime in the immediate area, the data does support the theory that illegal activity in the area decreased as the park was improved.\n\nKenney used the efforts in Hunting Park as an example of why City Council should authorize more funds to revitalize parks and recreation centers throughout the city. He said \"when the city and the Fairmount Park Conservancy invested $5 million in Hunting Park, crime went down 89 percent within a half mile radius of the park over the next three years.\"\n\nThe Fairmount Park Conservancy confirmed that it -- along with the city and private donors -- invested about $5 million in revitalizing the park. Vandenburg, who conducted the study, said crime did in fact drop by 89 percent within a half-mile radius over the next three years.", "lang": "en"}
