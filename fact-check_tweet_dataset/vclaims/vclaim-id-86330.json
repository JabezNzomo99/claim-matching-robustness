The Washington Post reported the \u201cdramatic simplicity\u201d of the plan was \u201cits fatal flaw as conservatives rebelled at the deep cuts it would have made in Reagan\u2019s military buildup, liberals balked at the constraints it would have put on major domestic benefit programs such as Social Security and many moderates shuddered at both results.\u201d\n\nRussert: \u201cSenator, we have a deficit. We have Social Security and Medicare looming. The number of people on Social Security and Medicare is now 40 million people. It\u2019s going to be 80 million in 15 years. Would you consider looking at those programs, age of eligibility \u2026\u201d Russert: \u201c\u2026cost of living, put it all on the table.\u201d\n\nDuring a Senate floor speech over the GOP plan for a balanced budget calling for reducing Medicare spending by $270 billion over seven years, Biden said, \u201cYou guys want a balanced budget in 7 years, and you want CBO [Congressional Budget Office] numbers. I want a balanced budget, too, but I do not want to cut as much Medicare as you do. I do not want to cut as much as you do, and I do not want to give as big a tax break as you want.\u2019\u2019\n\nBiden went on to say: \u201cSo we can make a deal, make a deal. We will split the difference between the CBO figure of 2.4 and the OMB [Office of Management and Budget] figure of 2.6. Take 2.5 \u2014 that is $250 billion. And make another agreement. Agree I will go for a bigger cut in Medicare. I say we only need to do $89 billion. That is all we need \u2014 not $270 billion. I will split the difference with you on that.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
