The WHO Africa statement reads:\n\n\u201cAs efforts are under way to find treatment for COVID-19, caution must be taken against misinformation, especially on social media, about the effectiveness of certain remedies. Many plants and substances are being proposed without the minimum requirements and evidence of quality, safety and efficacy. The use of products to treat COVID-19, which have not been robustly investigated can put people in danger, giving a false sense of security and distracting them from hand washing and physical distancing which are cardinal in COVID-19 prevention, and may also increase self-medication and the risk to patient safety.\u201d\n\nAlso widely reported was the immediate response of the National Academy of Medicine of Madagascar (ANAMEM), which was quoted as stating:\n\nOn 25 April 2020 it was reported online by Midi Madagasikara, following a meeting between president Rajoelina and officials of ANAMEM, that ANAMEM had declared the following in a statement about the use of Covid-Organics:\n\nTambavy is a generic name for traditional Madagascan herbal teas or plant-based infusions.\n\nANAMEM\u2019s softened tone following the meeting with Rajoelina didn\u2019t escape notice as the Midi Madagasikara article ended with the following sentence:\n\nIt should be noted that none of the reports about Covid-Organics discuss clinical trial data concerning the safety and effectiveness of the touted remedy.\n\nAccording to various reports, the main ingredient of Covid-Organics is Artemisia, which the online Encyclopaedia Britannica describes as follows:\n\n\u201cArtemisia, (genus Artemisia), any of a genus (Artemisia) of aromatic herbs and shrubs in the Asteraceae family. Examples include wormwood, sagebrush, and tarragon. Many species are valued as ornamentals for their attractive silvery gray foliage, which is frequently used in horticultural plantings to create contrast or to smooth the transition between intense colors. The leaves of common wormwood (A. absinthium) have been used in medicines and beverages such as absinthe and vermouth. An extract from the Eurasian A. annua is used to treat quinine-resistant malaria.\u201d\n\nIn a 29 April 2020 online report by Midi Madagasikara the Malagasy Institute of Applied Research (IMRA) stated of the ingredients of Covid-Organics:\n\nArtemisia forms part of anti-malaria treatments, and the WHO states on its pharmaceutical use:\n\nHowever, the WHO position on the non-pharmaceutical use of Artemisia is:\n\nTo be clear, Madagascar\u2019s Covid-Organics is a non-pharmaceutical remedy.\n\nThat said, the Malagasy Institute of Applied Research (IMRA) isn\u2019t the only institute looking to Artemisia as a potential answer to the COVID-19 disease.\n\nOn 8 April 2020, days before the launch of Covid-Organics in Madagascar, Germany\u2019s renowned Max Planck Institute announced that it would be conducting laboratory tests using Artemisia extracts and derivatives to treat cells infected with COVID-19.\n\nIn light of all the above, Namibia Fact Check could find no clinical trial evidence to substantiate claims about the curative effects of Covid-Organics and cautions against proclaiming such effects, as such claims could amount to spreading disinformation.\n\nFor another useful fact check of the claims surrounding Covids-Organics, see this informative fact check by Africa Check.", "lang": "en"}
