The family required Rs 10 lakh for her treatment, an appeal for which was made to the PMO last year in July. Two months later, in September 2018, partial financial assistance of Rs 3 lakh was provided to Lalita.\n\nSince then, the family has been struggling to gather the remaining Rs 7 lakh. The Times of India reported on June 22, 2019, that the family, unable to arrange for the funds, sought euthanasia for their daughter in a written request to chief minister Yogi Adityanath. Soon after, media reports started pouring in with the claim that the prime minister extended Rs 30 lakh aid for the ailing child.\n\nOn June 22, ANIcarried a report claiming that the family was granted Rs 30 lakh financial assistance by the PMO. Several media outlets subsequently published reports based on the ANI story \u2013 Times Now, The Quint, Asian Age, India Today, Republic, Financial Express, Hindustan Times, DNA and Deccan Chronicle.The Quint claimed that the family had already received assistance to the tune Rs 30 lakh and was making renewed appeals for more funds.\n\nDainik Jagran and Jansattaalso carried reports on the \u201cRs 30 lakh\u201d story. An English translation of Dainik Jagran\u2019s over-blown headline read \u2013 \u201cPM answers her calls, Lalita no longer wishes death as she gets the gift of life.\u201d\n\nBJP West Bengal MP Babul Supriyo tweeted the India Today story, thus attracting nearly 6,000 likes and over 900 retweets to the claim that PM Modi sanctioned a grant of Rs 30 lakh to the ailing child.\n\nIn a June 23 article in The Times of India, the family termed the news reports \u201cfake\u201d and said, \u201cAfter the intervention of Etah MP Rajveer Singh, who wrote a letter to PMO for financial assistance, only Rs 3 lakh was sanctioned last year on September 30. The report of Rs 30 lakh grant is fake and it has hurt our efforts to get help for my daughter. We need help for our dying girl. This fake news can cost my daughter\u2019s life.\u201d\n\n\n\nLalita, who is bedridden, told TOI, \u201cHad PMO granted Rs 30 lakh against Rs 10 lakh requirement, I would have got new lease of life. This is cruel. Whoever has spread this fake news must visit me and see my condition. My family has lost their entire savings, farmland and mortgaged our home to pay my medical bill.\u201d\n\nLast year, BMT RK Birla Cancer SMS Hospital, Jaipur gave an estimate of Rs 10 lakh for Lalita\u2019s treatment. A letter stating the same was recently tweeted by TOI journalist Arvind Chauhan.\n\nThe family sent a letter to the PMO through BJP Etah MP Rajveer Singh in July last year, asking for financial assistance. The prime minister\u2019s office replied two months later, in September 2018, that a partial sum of Rs 3 lakh has been granted to the family from the prime minister\u2019s national relief fund.\n\nChauhan shared the PMO\u2019s response in a June 23, 2019 tweet. The letter said, \u201cPlease refer to your letter dated nil received through Shri Rajveer Singh (Raju Bhaiya)\u2026letter dated 14/07/2018, regarding financial assistance for Aplastic Anaemia of Miss Lalita Kumari\u2026The Prime Minister has sanctioned a grant of Rs 300000.0/- from the Prime Minister\u2019s National Relief Fund to partially defray the expenses involved in the surgery/treatment subject to the conditions mentioned overleaf\u2026\u201d\n\nNot only did the media circulate incorrect information but Dr Dinesh Arora, the deputy CEO of PM\u2019s flagship health scheme Ayushman Bharat, retweeted a tweet which wrongly claimed that Rs 30 lakh was granted to the family.\n\nDespite the letter clearly stating that a grant of Rs 3 lakh was sanctioned, an extra \u2018zero\u2019 found a place in media reports nine months after the money was dispersed. Moreover, there has been no fresh announcement of additional financial assistance from the PMO, which is clear from Arora\u2019s tweet where he says, \u201chave requested state to help\u2026\u201d\n\nAlt News contacted Chauhan who said that the state government has now stepped in and offered to help the girl. \u201cCMO Agra has offered to arrange for free treatment for Lalita at SGPGI Lucknow,\u201d he told Alt News. This was also reported in the media.\n\nA misreport carried by nearly every mainstream media outlet could have potentially derailed the girl\u2019s treatment. It is rather peculiar that a 9-month old grant was inflated ten times and floated by the media simultaneous to the family\u2019s fresh appeals for financial assistance. Clarifications or corrections to the articles are yet to be made despite the family calling out the misinformation and the CMO Agra transferring the girl to Lucknow for treatment.\n\nUPDATE: [After Alt News\u2019s fact-check was published, ANI took down its story, however, sans clarification. The same was done by India Today. The Quint rectified its story and added a clarification. Jansatta included The Times of India\u2019s findings in its report without making any other changes to the copy. ]", "lang": "en"}
