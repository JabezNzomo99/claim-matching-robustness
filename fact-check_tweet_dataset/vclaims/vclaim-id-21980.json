No, it's fake: It is a digitally-created image combining two photos to make it appear that a massive whale is swimming under a suspension bridge. There are no whales, big or small, swimming under the Samuel De Champlain Bridge in Quebec, Canada, the Samuel De Champlain Bridge in Quebec, Canada. The artist shared how he created the striking image on his website.\n\nThe false claim about the photo has circulated for a while on social media, including recently in a post (archived here) published on September 21, 2019 under the title \"One of the largest blue whales ever caught on camera during a helicopter ride today\".
