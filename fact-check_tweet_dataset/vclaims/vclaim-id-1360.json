The Ozarks Community Hospital is not considered a rural hospital because it\u2019s located in Springfield, population 160,000. The hospital contained 45 beds, plus 10 more in its geriatric psychiatry unit, a small number for a city of that size.\n\nAccording to Ryan Barker at the Missouri Foundation for Health, Missouri could have expanded Medicaid starting Jan. 1, 2014, before any of the hospitals closed. Expanding Medicaid would have had a significant impact on the reimbursement of health care providers. Dave Dillon, a spokesman for the Missouri Hospital Association, told St. Louis Public Radio that the legislature\u2019s decision to not expand Medicaid will cost Missouri $4 billion in federal payments over the next six years.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, states were given the opportunity to expand the pool of citizens covered by Medicaid, a subsidized insurance for citizens living in poverty. The federal government would have covered the entire costs of the broadened coverage for the first three years, but the level of federal subsidy would decline after that.\n\nSince many rural hospitals were already in crisis before 2014 because of a large burden of uninsured patients, the failure to expand Medicaid isn\u2019t the direct cause for closings. However, Medicaid expansion was a missed opportunity to lessen the load on those affected hospitals. Says his amendment on a budget bill \u201cwould have helped get kids back in school after teachers were vaccinated. Every single Senate Democrat voted against it.\u201d\n\n\"Hospitals expected to see millions of newly insured customers thanks to federal subsidies enabling people to buy health insurance and the expansion of state Medicaid programs,\" explained the article. \"In exchange, they agreed to accept reduced Medicare payments and a huge cut in disproportionate share hospital, or DSH, funding, which the federal government pays to offset the costs of uncompensated care.\"\n\nSince approximately 40 percent of the hospital\u2019s patients were uninsured and it was being paid less money to treat them, the hospital was only able to admit patients following surgery by 2015, according to OCH Health System owner and CEO Paul Taylor in a Springfield News-Leader article.\n\nKoster\u2019s claim is a bit of stretch. Four small Missouri hospitals have closed entirely or in part since September 2014, three of which are rural. In half those cases, patients being unable to pay their bills was cited as a reason for the closure. And many of those patients likely would have been covered had Missouri expanded Medicaid. Koster\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.", "lang": "en"}
