It might have been legal, the contribution itself, but the way the money was earned was illegal.\"\n\nDid Browder's associates send $400 million to Hillary Clinton's campaign?\n\nNo. We found $17,700 donated to Clinton and another $297,000 to the Democratic National Committee.\n\nThe Russians say that Browder and his partners at Ziff Brothers Investments, a New York venture capital firm, illegally syphoned billions of rubles out of the country. To add salt to the wound, Browder had led the charge to pass the 2012 Magnitsky Act, a law that penalizes Russian officials suspected of sanctioning the death of Browder\u2019s lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in a Russian prison.\n\nThe Ziff brothers came up during the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Donald Trump Jr. and others, and Natalia V. Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer who promised dirt on the Hillary Clinton campaign. According to transcripts from Senate Judiciary Committee interviews, Veselnitskaya\u2019s materials described the Ziffs as Democratic donors, although Trump\u2019s son said they gave both to Democrats and Republicans.\n\nWe reached out to the Russian Embassy and the Russian consulate in Washington to get details on the $400 million donation and had not heard back in time for our deadline.\n\nGiven that Veselnitskaya tied Browder and the Ziff brothers together, we researched their political donations.\n\nBrowder became a British citizen and can\u2019t legally contribute to U.S. candidates. Ziff Brothers Investments through its executives can give freely, and they have.\n\nBefore we get into their political contributions, we also wondered if Putin could have been talking about money that went to the Clinton Foundation. In past years, Browder and Ziff Brothers Investments had given to the Clinton Global Initiative, a project of the Clinton Foundation, but the total was not more than $110,000, records show.\n\nIn the 2016 election cycle, Ziff Brothers Investments gave $1.7 million. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, nearly two-thirds, or about $1.1 million, went to Democratic committees, and the rest to Republicans.\n\nFederal law puts tighter limits on contributions to individual candidates. Here, the Ziffs mainly put their money into incumbents, and Republicans did better by a margin of about $145,000 to $46,000. Clinton\u2019s campaign received $17,700.\n\nUnless Putin had other Browder associates in mind, his figure of $400 million going to the Clinton campaign is a massive exaggeration. Between the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, the Ziffs gave about $315,000.\n\nThe Clinton campaign raised $563 million overall, so Putin's sum would account for nearly three-fourths of all donations. (PACs affiliated with Clinton's campaign raised an additional $231 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.)\n\nPutin said associates of Bill Browder gave $400 million to the Clinton campaign. The associates appear to be the Ziff brothers. According to public data, Ziff Brothers Investments gave about $315,000 to Clinton and the Democratic National Committee.\n\nOverall, the firm gave about $1.1 million to Democratic committees around the country.\n\nThe exaggeration is so great, we rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
