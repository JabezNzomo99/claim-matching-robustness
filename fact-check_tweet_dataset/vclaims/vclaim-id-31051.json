He will receive \u00a385,000 a year and a lump sum of \u00a3245,000 \u201cHe\u2019s the secretary for the Department for Works and Pensions\n\nThe figures on Sir Robert\u2019s pension allocations are broadly correct. According to DWP accounts for 2016/17 he had accrued a pension of \u00a380-85,000 a year and a lump sum on retirement of \u00a3240-245,000. This meant his total pension would be worth around \u00a31.8 million at that time. He retired in January 2018.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what the post means when it describes Sir Robert as being \u201cresponsible\u201d for increasing the state pension age\u2014he oversaw the DWP during part of the time this was being implemented, but he would not have made the final decision on the increase.\n\nPolicy decisions (such as raising the state pension age) are made by the government, and are then implemented by the civil service, of which Sir Robert was a part.\n\nThe civil service must serve the government of the day. Its code states that civil servants must \u201cserve the government, whatever its political persuasion, to the best of your ability in a way which maintains political impartiality and is in line with the requirements of this code, no matter what your own political beliefs are\u201d.\n\nSir Robert was permanent secretary at the DWP before his retirement. According to the civil service website the permanent secretary is \u201cthe most senior civil servant in a department.\u201d\n\n\u201cEach supports the government minister at the head of the department, who is accountable to Parliament for the department\u2019s actions and performance.\n\n\u201cThe permanent secretary is the accounting officer for their department, reporting to Parliament. They are responsible for the day-to-day running of the department, including the budget.\u201d\n\nThe policy also began before he joined the DWP\n\nThe state pension age in the UK is currently a little over 65 for both men and women. By October 2020 it will have risen to 66, from 66 to 67 between the years 2026 and 2028, and then from 67 to 68 between 2044 and 2046.\n\nSir Robert wasn\u2019t working at the DWP when the plan to increase the pension age from 65 to 68 was initially put forward. He joined as permanent secretary in 2011, having previously been at the Department for Transport.\n\nLegislation brought forward in 2007 originally said that the state pension would rise from 66 to 68 for both men and women between 2024 and 2046, the timetable for this was sped up in 2011 and again in 2014.", "lang": "en"}
