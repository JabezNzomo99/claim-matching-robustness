The video can be viewed here, however viewer's discretion is needed.\n\nThe 36-second-long video shows a group of men abusing and hitting the victim with rods and sticks while he pleads to be let off. The video has been shared from many Facebook pages with the same claim.\n\nBOOM reversed image searched keyframes from the video obtained using InVID, a video verification platform led us to to a news story published in a Hindi daily Dainik Bhaskar on March 14 this year. The report shares the same video and mentions that three people of the notorious gang were arrested by the Haryana police on March 13.\n\nAccording to several news reports, the incident is from Faridabad, Haryana. The gang operated in and around the NCR area and was involved mainly in extortion. The members recorded their barbaric act and uploaded it online to instill fear in public, the reports said.\n\nBOOM called the Haryana police to check the veracity of the viral claim. Sub-inspector Shamsher of Sector 55 police station said, \"These men belong to the 'fracture gang'. We were looking for them since a long time. They are notorious for breaking the limbs of their enemies and uploading the videos online.\"\n\nDenying any political or communal angle to the entire incident, the SI added: There are no political connections of these gang members. The victim was a local and the claim of him belonging to a particular community is false.\n\nNews agency ANI had also tweeted about the incident.\n\nShamsher added that the three accused who were arrested earlier in March are in jail now.", "lang": "en"}
