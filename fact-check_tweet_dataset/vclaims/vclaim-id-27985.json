He sought a vow to be a CM which is fulfilled now. My lord would fulfill his wishes. The lord has brought and given prosperity even to a party that has stood strong on the issue of Hindutva.\"\n\nAjmer Sharif Dargah is a sufi shrine (dargah) of the revered sufi saint, Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer, Rajasthan.\n\nWe performed a reverse image search using Google search and found that the images were old and not recent as being claimed in the viral posts.\n\nThe search results showed that the image was taken when Aditya Thackeray had visited the Ajmer Sharif Dargah in June, 2019. In the India TV report on him visiting the shrine, one can spot the same visuals as in the viral photo uploaded on June 9, 2019, by India TV.\n\nWe found that the image was taken when the Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray, along with his wife Rashmi and son Aditya had presented a 42 feet saffron chaddar with the dargah dome embroidered on it to a khadim at their residence at Matoshree in Mumbai on March 28, 2017.\n\nOne can spot the same image in the article published by the Times of India on March 28, 2017.\n\nThe chaddar was to be offered at the annual Urs at the dargah of Sufi Saint Hazarat Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti on April 4, 2017.\n\nOn performing a reverse image search a we found that the image was used in an article dated March 16, 2018, on a website Hello Mumbai.\n\nThe headline of the article read, 'Shiv Sena Chief Uddhav Thackeray Offers 'Chadar' At Ajmer Shariff Dargah', and it further mentions that the Chadar was offered on behalf of Shiv Sena Chief Uddhav Thackeray at the Darghah of Sufi Saint Khawaja Moinuddin Chisti.\n\nWe also found a tweet that contained the same image in a tweet by Rahul N Kanal on March 16, 2018.
