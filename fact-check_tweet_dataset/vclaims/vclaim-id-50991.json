No, that's not true: The U.S. Constitution states no such thing.\n\nThis idea was shared in a Facebook post (archived here) where it was published by Daryl E. Grant on December 19, 2019, under the title \"Now they opened 2028 for him great job Democrat's.\" The meme said:\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nConservatives appear to have eaten this one up. The post has been shared more than 7,000 times, and it has been making the rounds again now that senators have been sworn in for the trial. A similar meme was published a month earlier by Jack Prosobiec, best known for the \"pizzagate\" conspiracy. His Twitter post was shared more than 13,000 times.\n\nThis is completely false. If acquittal in the Senate nullified a president's term, allowing the sitting president at the time another chance to run for election - as the meme states - it stands to reason that President Clinton would have run again in 2000 on the Democratic ticket, instead of Al Gore.\n\nJust think: There would've been no hanging chads in the 2000 election, when George Bush W. Bush won the White House after a Supreme Court battle over the handling of ballots.\n\nThe 22nd Amendment of the Constitution couldn't be more clear on how many times a person can be elected president: \"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.\"\n\nThe Constitution, which lays out the impeachment process in Articles I and II, says nothing about nullifying a president's term on acquittal. The conservative Heritage Foundation agrees on this one, and the foundation's guide to the Constitution and impeachment can be read here.", "lang": "en"}
