Ted Cruz added fuel to the long-running fight when he claimed California \"is hemorrhaging population\" in a recent Senate debate with his Democratic challenger Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke.\n\n\"There are also states that implement the kind of policies that Congressman O\u2019Rourke supports, high taxes, high regulations, open borders, states--you look at California, which is hemorrhaging population. You know the cost of a one-way U-haul from California to Texas is more than 300% the cost the other way around.\"\n\nSen. Cruz make his claim in the video above.\n\nIn 2014, our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas fact-checked the claim that U-hauls from California to Texas are more expensive. In 2014, they found they cost twice as much as ones headed in the reverse direction.\n\nFor this fact check, we focused on Cruz\u2019s claim about California\u2019s population -- a statement brought to our attention on Twitter by applied demographer Jeffrey Wright.\n\nWe agreed with Wright that it was time for a fact check.\n\nAsked about the claim, Cruz\u2019s campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed to several news and government reports on Californians leaving for other states.\n\nThe evidence for that is clear. We explored it in a recent fact check on Republican gubernatorial candidate John Cox when he made an exaggerated claim that \"half the people\" in California want to leave.\n\nWe reported that California\u2019s once-rapid population growth has slowed in recent decades. More people have been leaving for other states than have been moving in from the rest of the country for many years, according to a February 2018 study by the California Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office.\n\nAbout five million people moved to California from other states, while about six million left the state from 2007 to 2016, according to the LAO report, which cited data from the American Community Survey.\n\nHere\u2019s who\u2019s moving from and to California, according to the report:\n\n\"Families with kids and those with only a high school education predominate among those moving from California to its top destination states (Texas, Arizona, and Nevada). College-educated 18 to 35 year olds led the way among those moving to California from its top feeder states (New York, Illinois, and New Jersey).\"\n\nBut we also found the gap between the number of Californians who left for other states and those who arrived from the rest of the country has narrowed considerably. That gap was several hundred thousand people per year in the 1990s and mid 2000s, but dropped to a few thousand per year during the Great Recession, before again increasing. Still, that\u2019s hardly a \"hemorrhaging,\" especially considering this is only a subset of the state\u2019s overall population.\n\nThe migration to other states does not mean California\u2019s overall population is in decline. Just the opposite: It\u2019s grown by an average 333,000 people per year since 2010 largely due to natural births and international migration, according to the California Department of Finance.\n\nCalifornia was home to 39.8 million people as of January 2018, according to the finance department. That included an increase of 309,000 residents in 2017 alone and nearly 2.3 million over seven years.\n\nIn reality, California\u2019s population has grown by an average of 333,000 per year since 2010 due to natural births and international migration.\n\nThere\u2019s a sliver of truth in Cruz\u2019s statement: The state for many years has lost more people to other states -- including Texas -- than it\u2019s gained from the rest of the country. But even that interpretation of the claim doesn\u2019t show a \"hemorrhaging.\" The gap between Californians leaving for other states and those arriving from the rest of the country narrowed considerably over the past decade.\n\nIn the end, the senator ignored key facts that would give a different impression.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE \u2013 The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.", "lang": "en"}
