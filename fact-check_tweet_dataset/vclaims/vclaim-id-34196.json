The claim is false; the details in the image do not correspond to a real flight booking; the candidate in question -- who won the election -- has denied the claims.\n\nThis Facebook post, published on November 9, 2019, includes a composite image of an electronic air-ticket and Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the Sri Lanka Podujana Party presidential poll candidate, who won the country\u2019s recent poll and was sworn in to office November 17.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe Sinhala-language text superimposed on the image translates to English as: \u201cGota accepts defeat\n\n \"Basil stops spending on the election\n\n \"Couple decides to leave the country before court cases begin\n\n Air tickets reserved to flee to America via Dubai\n\n Future of the flower bud uncertain\u201d.\n\n\u201cGota\u201d is in reference to Gotabaya Rajapaksa.\n\n\u201cBasil\u201d is in reference to Basil Rajapaksa -- the brother of Gotabaya Rajapaksa and former Minister of Economic Affairs in Sri Lanka.
