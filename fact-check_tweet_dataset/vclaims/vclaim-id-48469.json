The text in the posts has circulated for years without references to Trump, and it is riddled with false claims.\n\nThere is no proposed legislation before Congress called the \u201cCongressional Reform Act.\u201d\n\nBut Facebook posts shared by more than 67,000 people purport that President Donald Trump \u201cis asking everyone to forward this email\u201d about a supposed \u201cCongressional Reform Act of 2017.\u201d\n\nIn reality, online chatter about that supposed bill \u2014 and the ideas that follow it in the post \u2014 precedes the Trump administration. We wrote in 2011 about emails circulating the same text, which we found to be a blend of false, misleading and opinion-based statements. Some examples:\n\u2022 The post claims that the bill would \u201cno longer\u201d allow Congress to \u201cvote themselves a pay raise.\u201d But, as we\u2019ve written before, that\u2019s already the case. Pay raises are determined by an automatic adjustment formula, which takes according Congress has denied the raise every year since 2009.\n\u2022 None It also says, members of Congress must \u201cabide by all laws they impose on the American people (i.e. NO MORE INSIDER TRADING!!!).\u201d But that\u2019s largely the case now. The 1995 Congressional Accountability Act , for example, req uires members to \u201cfollow many of the same employment and workplace safety laws applied to private business.\u201d As for insider trading, the STOCK Act signed in 2012 bars members from making trades based on nonpublic information obtained through their official duties.\n\u2022 The post says \u201c Congress (past, present, & future)\u201d must participate in Social Security, and that \u201c[a]ll funds in the Congressional retirement fund\u201d must \u201cmove to the Social Security system immediately.\u201d In fact, members of Congress have been required since 1984 to pay Social Security taxes and participate in the system, according to a CRS report\n\nA search of legislation introduced in Congress since Trump took office shows there has been no \u201cCongressional Reform Act\u201d proposed. (In 2017, there was a proposed \u201cCongressional Pension Reform Act,\u201d which dealt strictly with proposed pension system changes; the legislation did not advance beyond its introduction.)\n\nWe also could find no evidence to suggest that Trump is \u201casking everyone to forward\u201d the online message. A search of the president\u2019s tweets through the Trump Twitter Archive, for example, shows he has never tweeted about a \u201cCongressional Reform Act.\u201d He has tweeted about \u201ccriminal justice reform,\u201d \u201cimmigration reform,\u201d \u201ctax reform\u201d \u2014 among other \u201creforms\u201d \u2014 but not \u201ccongressional reform.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
