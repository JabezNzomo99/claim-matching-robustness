The claim is false; satellite images show the bridge has been in use for over a decade; a local official told AFP that the bridge had never been inaugurated by Modi.\n\nThe photo was published in this Facebook post on June 20, 2019. It has been shared more than 300 times.\n\nThe post's caption says: \u201cPlanned by CM Modi, inaugurated by PM Modi, Jamnagar-Junagadh highway bridge collapsed within 3 months of inauguration!!\u201d\n\nPM Modi refers to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was Chief Minister (CM) of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 before becoming India's prime minister.\n\nJamnagar and Junagadh are two cities in the western Indian state of Gujarat and the Jamnagar-Junagarh highway connects them by road.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Facebook post:\n\nThe same photo and claim was also shared elsewhere on Facebook, for example here and here, and the West Bengal unit of India\u2019s opposition Indian National Congress party also shared the photo on its Facebook page here with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; satellite images show the bridge has been operational for over a decade and local officials said it was never inaugurated by Prime Minister Modi.\n\nA Google keyword search found multiple local media reports in Gujarati language containing similar images of the collapsed bridge, for example, here, here and here.\n\nLocal television channel TV9 Gujarati published this report on June 19, 2019 about the bridge collapse.\n\nThe Gujurati headline translates to English as: \u201cYears-old bridge on the Jamnagar-Junagadh Highway suddenly collapsed, but no casualties caused.\u201d\n\nThe report also contains a video of the collapsed bridge. A screenshot of the video corresponds with the collapsed bridge shown in the misleading Facebooks posts.\n\nBelow is a comparison screenshot of the video published on TV9 Gujarati website (R) and photo posted in the Facebook post (L) with a similar portion highlighted in blue:\n\nUsing location details from the multiple media reports, AFP found satellite images of the bridge using mapping tool Google Earth Pro.\n\nBelow is the most recent satellite image of the bridge, taken in November 2018:\n\nThe oldest available satellite image of the bridge is dated October 26, 2009:\n\nLocal Sub-divisional magistrate, GK Miyani, told AFP by phone on June 24, 2019: \u201cThe bridge was around 50 years old and collapsed due to heavy vehicular movement on the busy Jamnagar-Junagadh Highway.\"\n\n\"PM Modi has not visited the area recently, so there is no question of him inaugurating the bridge here,\u201d he added.\n\nIndian fact check website Boom Live debunked the same misleading Facebook posts in this report.", "lang": "en"}
