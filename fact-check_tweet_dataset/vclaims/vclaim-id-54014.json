Carlson claimed that the Times is \u201cdoing a story on the location of my family's house.\u201d The New York Times was quick to deny the charge on Twitter:\n\nRegardless of whose version of events is correct, one thing is sure: The New York Times has not published Carlson\u2019s address and Antifa has not \u2018\u201cshown up threatening his wife & kids.\u201d Even Carlson did not go so far on his show, instead claiming that while such a story existed it had not yet been published and was \u201cslated to run in the paper this week.\u201d Carlson had his home address revealed in 2018, leading to protesters showing up outside his home and harassing his family. Carlson mentioned on his show Monday that his family had to move as a result, and currently his new address is not publicly known.\n\nThe viral post seems to have mixed elements from Carlson\u2019s past experience with doxxing with his current claim of the New York Times\u2019 threat to do so. However, the Times has not published an article revealing Carlson\u2019s address and continues to deny that the paper ever planned to do so.", "lang": "en"}
