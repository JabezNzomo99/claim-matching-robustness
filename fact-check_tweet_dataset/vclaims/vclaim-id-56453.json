This is false; experts told AFP Fact Check that the compound in question does not exist.\n\nThis post, shared more than 8,000 times, alleges \u201cdoctors in the United States have found new cancer in human beings, caused by Silver Nitro Oxide. Whenever you buy recharge cards, don\u2019t scratch with your nails, as it contains Silver Nitro Oxide coating and can cause skin cancer\u201d.\n\nIt also asks readers to avoid a list of drugs because \u201cthey contain Phenyl Propanol-Amide PPA. Which causes Strokes & Are banned in USA (sic)\u201d.\n\nThe post makes multiple claims about mobile phones including adverse radiation effects, alleging that \u201cwhen phone's battery is low to last bar, don't answer the phone, bcos the radiation is 1000 times stronger\u201d.\n\nSimilar claims have been shared here, here, and here.\n\nThe claims about a new type of cancer are false; experts told AFP Fact Check that \"silver nitro oxide\" does not exist.\n\n\"There is no such chemical called, \u2018silver nitro oxide\u2019,\u201d a spokesperson for the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) told AFP Fact Check in an email on June 13, 2020.\n\nAFP Fact Check ran a search of the database of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an intergovernmental agency run by the World Health Organization (WHO) that coordinates research into the causes of cancer.\n\nThe list of carcinogenic substances does not include \u201csilver nitro oxide\u201d.\n\nDr William G. Cance, the chief medical and scientific officer for the American Cancer Society, also told AFP Fact Check that \u201cthere is no valid evidence that \u2018silver nitro oxide\u2019 is carcinogenic based on searches of the IARC and EPA databases\u201d.\n\nWHO: Mobile phone radiation has no adverse health effects\n\nThe claims about risky radiation are equally false; the peak radiation power for mobile phones is only about 2 watts -- which does no harm to the body.\n\nAccording to the WHO, mobile phones are \u201clow-powered radiofrequency transmitters, operating at frequencies between 450 and 2700 MHz with peak powers in the range of 0.1 to 2 watts\u201d.\n\nThe UN health agency also says that mobile phone radiations have not shown any adverse effects.\n\n\"A large number of studies have been performed over the last two decades to assess whether mobile phones pose a potential health risk. To date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use\u201d.\n\nIt is true that PPA, which stands for phenylpropanolamine -- not \u201cPhenyl Propanol-Amide\u201d as the post claims -- has been linked to haemorrhagic stroke among young women. The US Food and Drug Administration said in a 2015 bulletin that \u201cthe risk of hemorrhagic stroke is very low, even with phenylpropanolamine use\u201d.\n\nHowever, the FDA said it was taking steps to remove PPA \u201cfrom all drug products and has requested that all drug companies discontinue marketing products containing phenylpropanolamine\u201d.\n\nThe agency advised \u201cconsumers to discuss alternative over-the-counter and prescription products with their health care providers or pharmacists\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
