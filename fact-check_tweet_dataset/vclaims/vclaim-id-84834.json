Is that correct? The Trump campaign, as usual, did not answer our request for additional details.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear where Trump is getting this information. We could not find the source, even after checking with the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, FBI, groups that oppose and support immigration, and experts who keep track of domestic or international terrorism cases in the United States.\n\nThe claim may be a bungled reference to a list from the office of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) of 30 foreign-born individuals who were arrested on charges relating to terrorism in recent years. This list is quoted in several articles, and described as a \u201cpartial inventory of recently implicated terrorist migrants.\u201d Sessions is also a high-profile supporter of Trump and chairs his national security advisory committee.\n\nWe checked indictment records and looked for citizenship or immigration information, where available. The majority of the 30 cases involved naturalized U.S. citizens \u2014 people who came to the U.S. as children or had arrived before 2011.\n\nWe reviewed similar lists of cases from 2014 and 2015, involving 76 people charged with activities relating to foreign terrorist organizations. Of them, 57 were U.S. citizens, seven were lawful permanent residents and two were refugees. The rest were visa overstays or unknown. There were both naturalized and natural-born U.S. citizens (including those of Caucasian, African American or Hispanic descent), and many of the naturalized citizens had arrived in the country as children.\n\nIn general, individuals must live in America at least five years with a green card to qualify for U.S. citizenship. The actual citizenship process can take up to a year or more. So even if Trump is counting naturalized citizens as \u201cmigrants,\u201d the ones listed in these cases would not qualify as \u201crecent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have seen no evidence that there are \u2018scores\u2019 of recent migrants charged with terrorism,\u201d said Seth Jones, director of the International Security and Defense Policy Center at the Rand Corp. \u201cMost of the FBI arrests for ISIS-related charges have been American citizens or permanent residents.\u201d\n\nThe number of people accused of actually plotting attacks in the United States on behalf of the Islamic State terror group is smaller. Of the 64 people arrested on international terrorism charges between March 2014 and July 2015, 20 were \u201cdomestic plotters,\u201d according to a memo published by the federal public defender\u2019s office in New York. Social media has played an important role in the radicalization of American sympathizers of the Islamic State, a George Washington University\u2019s study of its recruits in the U.S. found.\n\nAbout 10 terrorism-related cases since 2009 have involved refugees \u2014 again, they are not \u201crecent migrants.\u201d One instance was when two Iraqi refugees were arrested in Bowling Green, Ky., in 2011 on suspicion of plotting to send weapons to insurgents to kill American soldiers abroad. They were sentenced to federal prison (one for life, the other for 40 years).\n\nAfter that case, the FBI\u2019s director of Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center told ABC News that there were dozens of terrorism investigations into resettled refugees. But according to former and current U.S. law enforcement officials, the scope of that investigation has been narrowed down to about two dozen people.\n\nThe Tsarnaev brothers in the Boston Marathon bombing case were initially described as refugees in news reports, but it was later revealed that the brothers ended up in the United States as minors because their father applied for asylum. Again, Trump\u2019s description of \u201crecent migrants\u201d would not apply.\n\n\u201cOne implication of his statement is that we\u2019re keeping secrets about terrorism prosecution, and that\u2019s false,\u201d Banks said. \u201cIn extraordinary circumstances, indictments might be sealed when there\u2019s a concern about the security of the evidence or safety, of a potential witness, or something like that. But I can\u2019t think of an instance involving terrorism in the United States that might be true.\u201d\n\nTrump gave a prepared speech for once, with even a teleprompter. So one would presume that someone would have looked this stuff up before writing it into his speech. Alas, there is no evidence that \u201cscores\u201d of \u201crecent migrants\u201d are charged with terrorism, and that for every case made public, there are \u201cdozens and dozens more.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
