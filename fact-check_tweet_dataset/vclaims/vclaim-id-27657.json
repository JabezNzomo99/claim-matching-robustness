But with baby names it all comes down to what you consider to be the same name. Is a name with a different spelling the same name as another, and what about common abbreviations?\n\nLooking just at the official list of baby names published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), Oliver was the most popular boys\u2019 name last year, followed by George, Harry, Noah and then Jack. Muhammad is eighth on the list\u2014what the graphic on Facebook does is combine a number of different ways of spelling that name.\n\nThere are many different spellings of the name Muhammad that were recorded for babies born last year\u2014more than the ones shown in the graphic. There around 7,100 baby boys born and given that name and another 100 or so given it as the first of a double-barrelled name.\n\nIf we look at other names that appear in the graphic, variations of the name Oliver (including double-barrelled first names and abbreviations like Olly) appear around 6,500 times. In 2017, variations on Oliver were more common than the various spellings of Muhammad.\n\nVariations and abbreviations (including double barrelled versions) of the name George appear about 5,200 times in 2018, and versions of the name Harry almost 4,800 times.\n\nBut Harry itself is an abbreviation or nickname of Henry. If we add up all the versions of the names Harry and Henry there were over 8,100 baby names registered in 2018\u2014putting them at the top of the list.\n\nThere are many ways the list of most popular baby names can be broken down and added up. In a blog post separate from the statistical release, the ONS said: \u201cWe don\u2019t add together names with similar spellings, or names with the same historic derivation. To do so would soon take us into the realms of subjectivity.\u201d\n\nIt adds that while the range of baby names overall has been diversifying in recent years \u201cthe number of babies named Muhammad (including variant spellings) has remained pretty consistent over the last 10 to 15 years. This is a key reason why Muhammad has climbed up the rankings in recent years.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack in 1996, when we first published annual lists of baby names with full counts, the top boys\u2019 name was Jack. There were 10,779 baby Jacks, a whopping 3.2% of all baby boys born that year.\n\n\u201cNow the number 1 name is given to only half that proportion of baby boys.\u201d\n\nWe think the ONS does not make this sufficiently clear in the release, meaning that readers are not given the information to fully judge the issue for themselves.", "lang": "en"}
