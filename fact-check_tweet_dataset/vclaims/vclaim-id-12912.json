Since then both the media and opposition politicians have accused the government of breaking one of their manifesto pledges.\n\nThe Conservative manifesto for the 2015 general election promised not to increase national insurance rates before 2020. It was only the legislation introduced to enforce this pledge that restricted this to employees.\n\nAround 84% of all people in work are employees and 15% are self-employed.\n\nThe manifesto vs the budget\n\nIn its manifesto for the 2015 election the Conservative party said \u201ca Conservative Government will not increase the rates of VAT, Income Tax or National Insurance in the next Parliament.\u201d It repeated this position three more times in the document.\n\nBut the Chancellor\u2019s speech for the 2017 spring budget announced that the main rate of Class 4 National Insurance Contributions for the self-employed would increase in 2018 and 2019.\n\nThere are four classes of national insurance contribution. Class 1 is paid by employed people, Class 2 is a flat rate paid by self-employed people who make over roughly \u00a36,000 in profit a year. This class will be abolished in 2018. Class 3 is paid voluntarily to top up any gaps you might have had in paying national insurance and Class 4 is paid by self-employed people on any profit over about \u00a38,000.\n\nThe reason given by the Chancellor for the change to Class 4 was that:\n\n\u201cHistorically, the differences in NICs [National Insurance Contributions] between those in employment and the self-employed reflected differences in state pensions and contributory welfare benefits. But with the introduction of the new state pension, these differences have been very substantially reduced\u2026\n\nThe lower National Insurance paid by the self-employed is forecast to cost our public finances over \u00a35 billion this year alone. That is not fair to the 85% of workers who are employees. The abolition of Class 2 NICs for self-employed people\u2026would further increase the gap between employment and self-employment\u2026 from April 2018, when the Class 2 NIC is abolished, the main rate of Class 4 NICs for the self-employed will increase by 1% to 10%, with a further 1% increase in April 2019.\u201d\n\nThe Chancellor went on to say that these changes would raise \u00a3145 million a year for the Treasury by 2021/22 and would still mean that self-employed people earning less than \u00a316,250 a year will see their national insurance contributions reduced. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said \u00a315,570, we\u2019re looking into why this is.\n\nThe Chancellor\u2019s argument has received some sympathy from experts like the Institute for Fiscal Studies which has said that \u201cthe difference in access to benefits is nowhere near enough to account for the NICs difference\u201d and has referred to the new change as \u201ca modest but welcome change\u201d.\n\nThe 2015 Conservative manifesto didn\u2019t specify whether it was only referring to certain types of national insurance.\n\nBut the Chancellor told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain that the Conservatives \u201cdealt with this issue back in 2015 when we legislated for the tax locks that we talked about during the election campaign. We introduced them into Parliament, we debated them then, we had a proper discussion about what the extent of these locks and ring-fences were and we put it all into legislation\u201d.\n\nThe legislation Mr Hammond is referring to ensured that the main rate of national insurance contributions paid by employers and employees, or Class 1, couldn\u2019t change from its 2015/16 rate.\n\nBut the law makes no mention of the national insurance rates paid by self-employed people, Class 2 and 4.\n\nNothing that's happened since the election changes the fact that the government isn't doing what it told voters it would in its 2015 manifesto.", "lang": "en"}
