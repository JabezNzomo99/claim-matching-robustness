An elderly woman had died in a train accident in Odisha\u2019s Soro. The region does not have a hospital but a community health centre where the old woman\u2019s dead body was brought. Due to the unavailability of an ambulance and auto-rickshaws charging over Rs 3,000, two workers of the health centre broke the woman\u2019s body at the hip for easy transportation to a nearby railway station. It needed to be transferred 30 km away to Balasore for postmortem.\n\nPhotographs of the incident are currently viral on social media, which might give the impression that the incident is recent. However, it took place in 2016 and the men breaking the bones of the dead body are not family but health workers.", "lang": "en"}
