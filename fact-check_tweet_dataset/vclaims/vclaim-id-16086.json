No, that's not true: a satire story from a liberal site that loves to troll conservatives into sharing fake news was picked up by a \"real\" fake news website and went viral. Van Dyke is not dead and he did not leave Trump any money.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on September 29, 2018 by America's Last Line of Defense titled \"Dick Van Dyke [1925-2018] Just Left $59 Million To Trump Foundation\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nOn Friday, the world lost one of the greats, Dick Van Dyke. The comedian and actor spent his lifetime keeping us entertained and reminding us that America is, at its core, a wholesome place. Van Dyke taught us that good, Christian morals are how we can get through as a nation, and he wanted to make sure that Americans have the chance to have the society they deserve. Breitbart News reports: In his will, Van Dyke specified that \"the total sale value of the house in Bermuda shall be donated to the Trump Foundation to help in their mission to make the country and world great again.\" This is the first time Dick Van Dyke has spoken out about President Trump. For whatever reason, he chose to do it from beyond the grave. But his message is clear: \"Only President Trump can save America from herself.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail, not making it immediately clear the story was false:\n\nBut the last time Breitbart News wrote about Dick Van Dyke was in 2016 when they reported about him introducing Bernie Sanders at a rally:\n\nIt would seem unlikely he would leave Trump any money, especially since the \"Breitbart News\" link in the story went to a Google Translate page that turned the phrase \"If you believe this, you are an idiot.\" into the Swedish equivalent.\n\nThe story was copied verbatim (archive copy here) by a website using the domain name \"abcnews.live\" (not the real abcnews.com) , which seems to be part of a larger network of sites all using the same Google Adsense account:\n\nSeveral of these sites were either registered in Macedonia or by a man using a Bulgarian telephone number. The copied version of the hoax racked up over 30,000 engagements so far on Facebook while the original got just over 10,000.\n\nThe site that originally posted the hoax comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including potatriotpost.us, dailyworldupdate.us and nofakenewsonline.us. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes trumpbetrayed.us as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
