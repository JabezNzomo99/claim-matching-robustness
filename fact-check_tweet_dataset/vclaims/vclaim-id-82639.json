The cartoon has resurfaced on social media with a narrative of a situation prevalent in India, where the benefits of the nation are enjoyed only by the ones who support the ruling party of the country.\n\nIn the cartoon, a cow, which is identified as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is seen eating a leaf, symbolising the Indian map. Meanwhile his excreta is seen collected in a container that symbolises the Indian people, while the milk drops in a bowl, which represents Narendra Modi-led BJP and his party members. A text accompanies the cartoon which says, \u201cAmazing cartoon by American cartoonist Ben Garrison... Showing the situation.\u201d\n\nYou can view the post below and its archived version here.\n\nBOOM got in touch with the American cartoonist Ben Garrison who denied having created any such cartoon. Garrison\u2019s team clarified to BOOM, \u201cThis is not a Ben Garrison cartoon and not even close to Ben\u2019s art style. All of Ben\u2019s cartoons are at grrrgraphics.com and if you do not see that cartoon there, you know it is fake.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the cartoonist\u2019s official Twitter handle had earlier replied to a tweet indicating that the cartoon has been wrongly credited to him.\n\nBOOM also ran a reverse image search and was directed to a Facebook page by Amal Medhi, who is the creator of the cartoon. We reached out to Medhi, who wasn\u2019t surprised that his cartoon, Make In India is doing the rounds again. He said, \u201cI know it is my Make In India Cartoon that has been photoshopped several times by several political parties to suit a campaign. It was a cartoon that I made and posted on Facebook four years ago. I did not share it with any newspaper. Neither did I use it for any magazine,\u201d Medhi clarified.\n\nThe original cartoon can be viewed below.\n\nThough Medhi has not filed any complaint for copyright infringement, he says he is \u201cexhausted\u201d due to the repeated duplication of his creation.\n\nThe Make In India Cartoon had earlier been used to depict a similar situation, but targeting the Congress \u2013 where the Gandhi family symbolised the pot which received the milk and the common people was represented by the container that collected the waste of the cow.", "lang": "en"}
