No, that's not true: The claim started as a satirical story published on a website that features fake reports designed to lure conservatives into sharing. Lead Stories does not flag satire as \"fake news,\" although copycat sites that steal the original without proper labeling are rated false.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by TatersGonnaTate.com on November 25, 2019 titled \"California Legislature Removes Christmas From All State Calendars and Events\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe site is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run byself-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies.
