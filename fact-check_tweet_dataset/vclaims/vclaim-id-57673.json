The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that people can catch the COVID-19 virus \u201cno matter how sunny or hot the weather is.\u201d\n\nSunlight has been cited as an alleged prevention method against contracting the new coronavirus by multiple social media users, with this particular post claiming, \u201cSunlight kills the Coronaviru [sic] (COVID-19) 15 minutes & you\u2019re good to go\u201d\n\nBut like many other supposed prevention methods making the rounds online, there is no evidence it is actually effective. The speculation about using sunlight to kill the new virus seems to stem from it containing ultraviolet (UV) rays that can kill viruses at certain levels. However, the level of UV needed to kill viruses far exceeds that found in sunlight, according to USA Today.\n\n\u201cUltraviolet (UV) is able to kill COVID-19 if it is exposed to the concentrated UV ray in certain amounts of time and distance,\u201d Dr. Pokrath Hansasuta, an assistant professor of virology in Chulalongkorn University\u2019s Department of Microbiology, told AFP Fact Check. \u201cHowever, that level of UV exposure is harmful to human\u2019s skin. Most likely, it will be in a light bulb or lamp as the natural UV from the sun is not strong enough to kill it.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) advises against using man-made UV sources to kill the COVID-19 virus because they can cause skin irritation. It also notes on its website that people can catch the disease \u201cno matter how sunny or hot the weather is.\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not mention sunlight as a means of preventing or treating the virus either.

The CDC website states that the best way for individuals to protect themselves from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is to wash their hands thoroughly, practice social distancing and avoid touching the eyes, nose and mouth after touching surfaces.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
