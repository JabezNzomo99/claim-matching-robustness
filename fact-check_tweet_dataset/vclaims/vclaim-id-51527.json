As videos of the blast started to make their way around social media, some people started sharing doctored footage that supposedly showed a missile caused this catastrophic event.\n\nHere\u2019s a screenshot from one such video:\n\nThis is not a screenshot from a genuine video of the explosion in Beirut. The screenshot comes from a manipulated video containing a digitally inserted missile. The original video, which can be seen below, does not show a missile:\n\nAfter the explosion, U.S. President Donald Trump added confusion to the situation when he referred to the incident as an \u201cattack.\u201d\n\nThe explosion in Beirut was not caused by a missile, and there\u2019s no indication, as of this writing, that this was any kind of attack.\n\nThe explosion seen in this video shows the detonation of 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate, a highly volatile explosive material, that had been stored at the Port of Beirut since the arrival of a Russian-owned cargo ship in 2013. For comparison\u2019s sake, approximately 2 tons of ammonium nitrate were used in the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly clear what caused this large cache of volatile explosive material to ignite. Videos of the event show a large fire at a warehouse shortly before the blast. The sound of fireworks is also notable in videos.\n\nJeffrey Lewis, a missile expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California, told the Associated Press:\n\n\u201cIt looks like an accident \u2026 First, there was a fire preceding the explosion, which is not an attack. And some of the videos show munitions what I could call popcorning, exploding like \u2019pop, pop, pop, pop.\u2019\u201d He added that \u201cit\u2019s very common to see fires detonate explosives.\u201d \u201cIf you have a fire raging next to something explosive, and you don\u2019t put it out, it blows up,\u201d he said.\n\nAn investigation into the incident is ongoing. The Associated Press reported that investigators will focus on why this large cache of ammonium nitrate was allowed to sit in the Port of Beirut for several years, as well as any possible negligence that led to the unsafe storage of this material.\n\nPublic anger mounted against the ruling elite that is being blamed for the chronic mismanagement and carelessness that led to the disaster. The Port of Beirut and customs office is notorious for being one of the most corrupt and lucrative institutions in Lebanon where various factions and politicians, including Hezbollah, hold sway. The investigation is focusing on how 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive chemical used in fertilizers, came to be stored at the facility for six years, and why nothing was done about it.", "lang": "en"}
