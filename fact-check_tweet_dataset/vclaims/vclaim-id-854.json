{"title": "EU Referendum Voting Guide: Stronger In on jobs", "subtitle": "The Electoral Commission's EU Referendum Voting Guide has been delivered to households this week. We've checked the claims in the campaigns' arguments.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-854", "url": "https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-referendum-voting-guide-stronger-jobs/", "vclaim": "Recent analysis by the Treasury has estimated that over three million jobs are linked to UK exports to the EU, which reflects similar estimates in the past. Three million jobs is about one in ten jobs in the UK.\n\nCrucially, it doesn\u2019t tell us anything about the number of jobs linked to British membership of the EU.\n\nThe figures try to estimate how many jobs are in industries that export to the EU, and add to that jobs that come about indirectly as a result of exporters\u2019 increased demand for products.\n\nWe don\u2019t know how these exports, and so the associated jobs, would be affected if the UK were no longer an EU member. That depends on the trading and other economic arrangements made in negotiations after a vote to leave.\n\nSo the three million figure is a statement about the economy as it is, not about what might happen if we remain in or leave the EU. A researcher behind one of the original estimates commented a few years ago that \u201cit\u2019s always been a bit of a false prospectus to say that three million jobs would be lost. It wouldn\u2019t mean an overnight loss of jobs; it wouldn\u2019t mean there would be a loss of prosperity instantly, just that the risks become greater\u201d.\n\nAs to what might happen to jobs if we vote to leave, the latest minutes from the Monetary Policy Committee at the Bank of England warn that some jobs might be lost, at least in the short term. That\u2019s in line with what seems to be the view of most other economists who\u2019ve said that leaving the EU would come at some cost to the economy.\n\nThis could mean unemployment rises by up to 1.7% in the short term, according to modelling done by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, if you accept the assumptions made in the model. That\u2019s in the region of 30,000 people, about the same number who are estimated to have entered work in the last few months.", "lang": "en"}
