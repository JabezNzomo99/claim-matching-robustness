The Clinton Foundation has not charged FEMA for bottled water or other relief items.\n\nI saw in a Google search that the Clinton Foundation is charging FEMA $7.00 a bottle for water they are sending them for flood relief. Is this true?\n\nA story published Aug. 30 on ourlandofthefree.com claims that the Clinton Foundation is taking advantage of \u201cObama era rules\u201d to charge FEMA for hurricane-related necessities like bottled water and hygiene products. The headline says, \u201cClinton Foundations [sic] Sends Water To Houston\u2026For $7 A Bottle.\u201d\n\nAccording to the story: \u201cThe Clinton Foundation is using an outdated rule for non-profits that states that they \u2018have the right to compete in the free market regardless of who the competition is.\u2019 What that translates to is, \u2018Since the guy on the corner is fleecing the terrified storm survivor for $7 per bottle, that\u2019s what we get to charge the federal government.'\u201d\n\nIt also says the \u201cClintons stand to bring hundreds of millions of dollars into their foundation for \u2018flood relief'\u201d by overcharging FEMA for items such as toilet paper, tampons and ice.\n\nThat\u2019s all false. FEMA, which leads the federal response to natural and man-made disasters, is not \u201cunder contract to pay\u201d non-profits like the Clinton Foundation for supplies due to \u201can out-dated rule.\u201d The story was intentionally fabricated.\n\nAs we have written before, a disclaimer on ourlandofthefree.com says that it\u2019s a \u201csatirical\u201d website that \u201cmakes no guarantee that anything you find here will be based at all in reality.\u201d Facebook users reported the bogus story after it was published Aug. 31 on freshdaily.news, a website with its own satire disclaimer.\n\nIn an email to FactCheck.org, Clinton Foundation spokesman Brian Cookstra confirmed that the organization has \u201cencouraged people to donate to relief efforts on the ground,\u201d but has had no part in selling supplies to FEMA. \u201cNothing in this story is true,\u201d Cookstra wrote.\n\nOn Aug. 28, days after Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas, the Clinton Foundation did share a list of \u201cmembers of the Clinton Foundation community\u201d that were contributing to relief efforts. But those organizations donated food, water, medicine and other items to local groups, shelters and churches. They did not sell supplies to FEMA.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nCookstra, Brian, director of communications for the Clinton Foundation.
