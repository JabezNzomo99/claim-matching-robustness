Others noticed a young woman on stage behind the president in camera shots, seemingly using the American flag to wipe her nose; she can also be seen wearing it as a scarf.\n\nBut some websites are falsely identifying the young woman as House Minority Leader \u201cNancy Pelosi\u2019s granddaughter Adrianna Pelosi.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is just another dirty liberal trick intended to make patriotic, red-blooded Americans look bad,\u201d a Sept. 9 story on theamericanews.co reads. \u201cLiberals will stop at nothing to push their agenda on the rest of us.\u201d\n\nThe dubious claim is undermined by the fact that the House Democratic leader doesn\u2019t even have a granddaughter named Adrianna \u2014 as her deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, confirmed to FactCheck.org. Pelosi has nine grandchildren and the girl in the video is not one of them, he said in an email.\n\nIn reality, the story was first published by a website that is part of a network whose self-described satirical work often gets mistaken for real news. The version republished on theamericanews.co failed to include any disclaimers about the piece\u2019s satirical intent.\n\nThe post included a photo of Pelosi with her granddaughter Madeline Prowda at the screening of an HBO documentary in May 2014.\n\nUsers on Facebook shared both versions of the story, some leaving comments betraying their belief in the nonsensical claim.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting and for Pelosi to allow this just shows us how deranged she is,\u201d one woman remarked.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time supposedly satirical websites have targeted Pelosi\u2019s family. In 2017, we wrote about fictional stories that claimed two of Pelosi\u2019s daughters had been arrested.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cBREAKING: Girl Who Wiped Nose With Flag At Trump Rally Is Pelosi\u2019s Granddaughter.\u201d Theamericanews.co. 9 Sep 2018.\n\n\u201cBREAKING: Girl Who Wiped Nose With Flag At Trump Rally Is Pelosi\u2019s Granddaughter.\u201d Worstpot.us/ever. 8 Sep 2018.\n\nHammill, Drew, deputy chief of staff to Rep.
