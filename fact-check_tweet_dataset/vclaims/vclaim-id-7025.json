In fact, portrayal of PM Modi as a karmayogi (a doer) and as a doyen with regard to administration and governance was instrumental in catapulting him and his party to majority in the Lok Sabha in the general election of 2014.\n\nThis assertion that PM Modi is an administrative genius was sought to be legitimised by reiterating that some of the leading public figures in the world in the fields of management, academia and business have endorsed Modi\u2019s competence. The supposed views of these leading public figures were shared widely by supporters, sympathisers and enthusiasts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Consider these examples.\n\nIt is claimed that Philip Kotler, an American marketing consultant, author and academic had said the following words about Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nAlt News contacted Professor Philip Kotler who is currently teaching at the Kellogg School of Management, Illinois. In an email conversation, Prof. Kotler said,\n\n\u201cThanks for bringing this quotation to my attention. The first part is correct that I have taught marketing theory to many people. I have also separately praised Narendra Modi for his leadership in some miscellaneous writing. But I never said: \u201cbut I cant teach marketing skills to Narendra Modi, he knows everything.\u201d I would never say that there is anyone in the world who knows everything.\u201d\n\nProfessor Louise Richardson, Vice-Chancellor at Oxford University, U.K is another well-known figure who was supposedly in awe of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s management skills. It has been claimed that Professor Richardson in a speech to her students had said, \u201cif there\u2019s anybody who can teach you better management skills than us, it\u2019s the Indian PM; you should listen to his speeches often.\u201d\n\nAlt News sent an email to Professor Richardson soliciting a response as to whether she had indeed said such a thing. Responding to our email, Executive Officer to the Vice-Chancellor Dr. Bethan Williams confirmed that Prof. Richardson had not said these words.\n\n\u201cI am all praise for the Indian PM, the steps he has taken, will bolster the economy and growth rate\u201d. These are the words ascribed to Jim Yong Kim, President of the World Bank.\n\nAlt News contacted World Bank in order to ascertain the veracity of the quotation. World Bank Press Secretary David Theis in an email conversation said,\n\n\u201cI have looked into the alleged quote from the World Bank, and can find no credible evidence of its veracity. It appears to be extrapolating from something said in 2016, which you\u2019ll find in this video:\u201d\n\nDr. Kim says in the video: \u201cWe\u2019re extremely pleased with the progress being made in the six priority areas. Prime Minister Modi and his government have set difficult targets, and I have been pleasantly surprised by how much progress has been made\u2026India\u2019s success over the last two years is one of the true bright spots\u2026in the global economy.\u201d Hope this answers your question.\n\nMicrosoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates, according to the quote ascribed to him had said \u201cI have seen many Leaders fail to perform under pressure, but PM Narendra Modi is perhaps the only leader I\u2019ve come across who\u2019s unaffected under pressure.\u201d\n\nAlt News contacted Bill Gates and also the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to verify if such a statement had indeed been made by Bill Gates. We also individually contacted representatives of the Foundation. Alt News will update the story after it has elicited a response from Gates or her/his representative. It may however be noted that the source of this quotation is the same as that of the other fake quotes listed above. Moreover, a statement of this nature from a public figure like Bill Gates would have been reportedly widely by the media, but no such record is to be found.\n\nActor and BJP MP Paresh Rawal (1,2,3) was among those who had shared these quotes on his Twitter timeline.\n\nDesi Mojito, a Twitter handle also tweeted these quotes on April 26, 2018. This post has been retweeted almost 1800 times.\n\nThese quotations carry the logo of The Fearless Indian which has a popular presence across social media platforms. However, these images can no longer be found on its pages and have likely been deleted. The above quotes have also been posted on websites such as www.indianceo.in and www.lolbaba.com. It may be noted that these quotes were shared widely after the demonetisation move announced by the Government in November 2016.\n\nSocial media has become a significant battleground for political parties. Various platforms are used by supporters to bolster the image of political parties and leaders. Political propaganda often blurs the line between fiction and fact. In the pursuit of representing PM Narendra Modi as a supremely capable leader, fake quotations were ascribed to leading celebrities and circulated widely.", "lang": "en"}
