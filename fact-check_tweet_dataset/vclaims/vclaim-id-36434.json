Wisdom is organized life.\u201d\n\nThis saying does not appear in any of Kant\u2019s writing.\n\nA German philosopher active during the 18th century Enlightenment movement, Kant made contributions to the fields of epistemology, metaphysics, ethics and aesthetics. His work \u201cCritique of Pure Reason,\u201d along with his other writings, helped establish him as an important figure in modern Western philosophy.\n\nHowever, the Daily Caller News Foundation found no record of the saying in Kant\u2019s writings. A search of several collections of his works turned up no matching or similar expressions.\n\n\u201cKant said a lot of interesting things but he did not say this,\u201d McMaster University professor and Kant scholar David Clark said in an email to the DCNF. \u201cIt sounds like the sort of thing a British philosopher might attribute to the Prussian master in order to give his or her work a certain credibility and gravitas.\u201d\n\nThe statement attributed to Kant in the Facebook post may actually be a combination of two quotes, one from sociologist Herbert Spencer and another from historian Will Durant, according to the website Quote Investigator.\n\n\u201cScience is organized knowledge; and before knowledge can be organized, some of it must first be possessed,\u201d Spencer wrote in an 1854 essay titled \u201cThe Art of Education.\u201d\n\nDurant appears to have combined Spencer\u2019s quote with one of his own in his 1926 book \u201cThe Story of Philosophy,\u201d in which Durant chronicles the work of history\u2019s greatest philosophers, including Kant. The expression is the author\u2019s attempt at capturing, in his own words, the views of Kant, but is not a direct quotation from the German philosopher.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
