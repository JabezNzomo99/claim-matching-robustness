It\u2019s unclear where the phrase originated.\n\nThis quote has been attributed to Jefferson countless times, appearing in numerous memes shared online. However, The Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence that Jefferson ever said or wrote this saying.\n\nThe phrase has been so frequently misattributed to Jefferson that it is included in the Thomas Jefferson Foundation\u2019s list of \u201cspurious quotations.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear where or when the phrase first appeared, though the foundation noted two suggestions.\n\nThe quote may be a rough paraphrase of one line in the Declaration of Independence: \u201cWhenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government.\u201d\n\nThe phrase also resembles a 1963 quote from Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s \u201cLetter from a Birmingham Jail\u201d in which he states, \u201cOne has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws.\u201d\n\nJefferson served two terms as the nation\u2019s third president.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
