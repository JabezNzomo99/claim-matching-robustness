So that\u2019s about it,\u201d the president said.\n\nNo movie about the martial law years? Wrong, and on so many levels.\n\nOne, ostensibly the Philippines\u2019 greatest filmmakers, Lino Brocka and Ishmael Bernal, both national artists, made films that are nothing less than critiques of the so-called \u201cconjugal dictatorship\u201d during the martial law years. These include Brocka\u2019s \u201cMaynila: sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag\u201d and Bernal\u2019s \u201cManila by Night.\u201d\n\nSource: Marcos, Brocka, Bernal, City Films, and the Contestation for Imagery of Nation\n\nTwo, some of the best Filipino movies are about the martial law years, including Mike De Leon\u2019s \u201cBatch \u201981\u201d and \u201cSister Stella L\u201d and Peque Gallaga\u2019s \u201cScorpio Nights.\u201d\n\nThree, movies about the martial law years are still being made after the 1986 People Power movement deposed Marcos from power, from the mainstream thriller \u201cEskapo: The Serge Osme\u00f1a-Geny Lopez Story\u201d by Chito Ro\u00f1o, to Sari Dalena\u2019s independent features \u201cKa Oryang\u201d and \u201cDahling Nick.\u201d\n\nFour, documentary movies have been made about the Marcoses, from Ramona Diaz\u2019 \u201cImelda,\u201d which won an award at Sundance, to \u201cPortraits of Mosquito Press\u201d by JL Burgos.\n\n\n\nFive, who can forget \u201cA Dangerous Life,\u201d the 1988 Australian movie, where Tessie Tomas played Imelda Marcos? Or \u201cDekada \u201870,\u201d which among others won Piolo Pascual the grand slam for best supporting actor.\n\nMissing this fact about the martial law years might seem trivial, except Duterte had earlier also said the violations under the Marcos dictatorship are yet to be proven in court.
