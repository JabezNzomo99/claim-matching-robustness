This results in a ratio of one doctor for every 6,355 people.\n\u2022 None The doctor-to-population ratio is in any case a flawed metric, as it doesn\u2019t take the geographical spread of doctors into consideration. \n\n\n\nto work in Kenya, a top official in the presidency said the Cubans would boost the country\u2019s low number of medics.\n\n, President Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s chief of staff, said in\n\na few days before the Cubans arrived.\n\nThis meant the country was \u201cnot\n\nanywhere near meeting the ratios required for the provision of quality healthcare to a majority of Kenyans\u201d.\n\nHow was the number calculated?\n\nThe ratio came from comparing the total number of doctors to the total population, State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu told Africa Check. He did not provide the figures used in the calculation, however.\n\nWas the government referring to the doctor-to-patient ratio or the doctor-to-population ratio? \u201cIt means the same, really,\u201d Esipisu claimed.\n\nBut the dean of the\n\n, told Africa Check that \u201cdue to the difficulty approximating the number of patients at any given time, most reports will use the doctor-population ratio as a proxy for coverage\u201d.\n\nHow many doctors does Kenya have?\n\nAll doctors operating in Kenya have to be registered with the\n\n- released in March 2018 - listed 6,394 actively practising Kenyan doctors. Of these, 2,591 were specialists. A further 939 were foreign doctors with temporary licenses, bringing the total to 7,333.\n\nat 46.6 million people for 2017. Dividing this by 7,333 doctors results in a ratio of one doctor for every 6,355 people - not 16,000.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, [the doctor-to-population ratio] is a flawed metric,\u201d Atwoli said. The ratio doesn\u2019t reflect the geographical spread of doctors or whether they are in private of public practice. And not all doctors are able to provide the same service, as some may be specialists.\n\nLukoye, who is also the vice-president of\n\n, added that an \u201cinteresting metric\u201d would be to rather examine \u201cthe proportion of patients requiring medical services who actually get to see a doctor, or those with conditions requiring specialised care who actually get to see a specialist\u201d.\n\nConclusion: Data shows claim by top official in presidency that one doctor treats 16,000 Kenyans is incorrect\n\nIn defending the Kenyan government\u2019s decision to enlist doctors from Cuba, President Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s Chief of Staff Nzioka Waita claimed that one doctor serves 16,000, and said this was a long way off a \u201crequired ratio\u201d.\n\nData from the country\u2019s medical board shows that the current proportion is one doctor for every 6,355 people.\n\nWe therefore rate the claim by Waita as incorrect.", "lang": "en"}
