Jean Carroll?)\n\nHowever, the Daily Caller did not find any credible media reports containing the image, and it only seems to show up on meme websites. A search of Trump\u2019s verified social media accounts didn\u2019t return any matching pictures either.\n\nSnopes, a fact-checking website, determined that the picture is a doctored version of a screen grab from Trump\u2019s April 1988 interview with Oprah Winfrey. Someone used Snapchat\u2019s \u201cBaby Filter\u201d to make Trump look like a toddler. A black-and-white filter has also been applied to age the picture, according to Snopes.\n\nDuring that 1988 interview, Winfrey asked Trump, who was in his early 40s at the time, whether he would ever consider running for president.\n\n\u201cProbably not, but I do get tired of seeing the country ripped off,\u201d answered Trump. \u201cI just don\u2019t think I really have the inclination to do it. I love what I\u2019m doing, I really like it.\u201d\n\nTrump posted an actual childhood picture on Instagram in August 2013.\n\n\u201cWho knew this innocent kid would grow into a monster?\u201d Trump jokingly captioned the photograph.", "lang": "en"}
