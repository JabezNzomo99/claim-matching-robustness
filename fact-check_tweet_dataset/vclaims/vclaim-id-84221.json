The claim is false; the clip actually shows the song being performed in a musical event held at a concert hall in Indonesia\u2019s capital Jakarta.\n\nThe video can be seen in dozens of Facebook posts, for example this May 10, 2019, post where it has been viewed more than 3,200 times since.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption, translated to English, reads: \u201cIndonesia Raya at the UN meeting. Conductor Adhi MS.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe caption is referring to prominent Indonesian conductor and music producer Addie MS. This is his official website.\n\nThis video appeared also on other dozens of Facebook posts, according to results of a query in the social media platform\u2019s search engine box, including here and here, where it has been viewed respectively over 15,000 times and 7,600 times since.\n\nBut the video does not show the anthem being played at a United Nations meeting.\n\nAFP ran key frames of the video obtained using digital verification tool InVid through a Google reverse image search.\n\nThis led to this video that was shared on YouTube by the conductor Addie on May 6, 2019.\n\nThe original video shows Addie\u2019s Twilite Orchestra and the Indonesian military music corps performing the national anthem at Aula Simfonia Jakarta -- a concert hall in the Indonesian capital.\n\nTNI refers to the Indonesian military. Here is the official Facebook page of their information department.\n\nPhotos of the concert hall can also be seen in the official website of Aula Simfonia Jakarta here and here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the concert hall photo as seen on its official website:\n\nBoth videos are 2 minutes and 9 seconds long. However, in the Facebook version, the genuine footage posted by Addie MS on YouTube has been cropped.\n\nBelow is a picture comparing the video on Facebook and the original one:\n\nAddie also posted the video on Twitter on May 7, 2019, which can be seen here.", "lang": "en"}
