Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral post is fake and is falsely attributed to UNESCO.\n\nA post doing rounds shows a photo of a certificate claiming that Idli is the healthiest breakfast item in the whole world as certified by UNESCO. The archived version of the post can be checked here.\n\nWe searched online whether UNESCO declared idli as the healthiest breakfast item in the whole world.
