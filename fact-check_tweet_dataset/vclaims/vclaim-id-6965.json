No, that news is old and was copy pasted from a 2017 news article. A Vietnamese site claiming to be about Native Amerian affairs has simply recycled the story to gin up clicks and advertising revenue.\n\nThe most recent copy of the article was published on May 5, 2018 by http://vi.nguoivietnamchau.info under the headline \"In Victory for Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, Court Finds That Approval of Dakota Access Pipeline Violated the Law\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe Standing Rock Sioux Tribe won a significant victory today in its fight to protect the Tribe's drinking water and ancestral lands from the Dakota Access pipeline. A federal judge ruled that the federal permits authorizing the pipeline to cross the Missouri River just upstream of the Standing Rock reservation, which were hastily issued by the Trump administration just days after the inauguration, violated the law in certain critical respects. In a 91-page decision, Judge James Boasberg wrote, \"the Court agrees that [the Corps] did not adequately consider the impacts of an oil spill on fishing rights, hunting rights, or environmental justice, or the degree to which the pipeline's effects are likely to be highly controversial.\" The Court did not determine whether pipeline operations should be shut off and has requested additional briefing on the subject and a status conference next week.\n\nBut the article was originally published on June 14, 2017:\n\nSince then the story has been copy pasted and published as \"recent\" news several times by various websites.\n\nNews reports at the time of the ruling mentioned that the pipeline did not need to be shut down right away, just that more studies had to be done that were done too fast or not well enough:\n\nBoasberg ruled that the Army Corps of Engineers, the body responsible for evaluating and issuing permits for the pipeline, \"did not adequately consider the impacts of an oil spill on fishing rights, hunting rights, or environmental justice, or the degree to which the pipeline's effects are likely to be highly controversial.\" However, Boasberg acknowledged that the corps had \"substantially complied\" with federal environmental laws. Further hearings to determine whether pipeline operations should be shut off will begin June 21. \"Whether Dakota Access must cease pipeline operations presents a separate question of the appropriate remedy, which will be the subject of further briefing,\" Boasberg said in his ruling.\n\nAs far as we've been able to ascertain those studies and the legal actions around them are still ongoing in April 2018:\n\nFor some reason news about the Standing Rock reservation and Native American affairs in general have become a favorite niche of foreign-run Facebook pages and websites.
