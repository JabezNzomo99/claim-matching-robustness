Trey Gowdy.\n\nThere is no record of Gowdy writing the essay. He confirmed to the Daily Caller that he did not author it.\n\nThe new coronavirus, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, has sickened more than 3.2 million people and killed some 230,000 others worldwide as of press time, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.\n\nAmid the ongoing pandemic, multiple Facebook users have attributed to Gowdy a conspiracy theory-laden essay about the coronavirus. The alleged essay starts: \u201cI\u2019m not saying Covid-19 isn\u2019t real\u2026 But pay attention folks, there\u2019s much more going on here than what meets the eye.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks like Trump is a sure bet for reelection after fending off 3 years of investigations and impeachment, then all the sudden world crisis pandemic,\u201d reads part of the essay attributed to Gowdy. \u201cStock market tumbles, companies are laying off employees, everything is closed and canceled, CEO\u2019s of giant companies are resigning and indictments are coming.\u201d\n\nGowdy allegedly concluded the essay by noting that \u201cit all just seems fishy, a little too well-timed if you ask me.\u201d (Related: Did Gowdy Defend The Transgender Military Ban In An Interview With CNN?)\n\nThe Caller didn\u2019t find any credible media outlets crediting Gowdy with the essay, however. A version that\u2019s unattributed to the former South Carolina congressman has been making the rounds on Facebook since at least mid-March.\n\nGowdy posted on his verified Facebook account on April 22 that he wanted \u201cto alert folks there is a fraudulent post attributed to me circulating on social media.\u201d In an email to the Caller, he also confirmed that he never said or wrote the coronavirus conspiracy theory.\n\nGowdy has publicly discussed the new coronavirus before, including a recent appearance on Fox News to discuss proposed legislation that would allow U.S. citizens to sue China.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also a need, a responsibility for the world to hold China accountable,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, let me say, if you cannot warn other countries that a pandemic has been unleashed, you have no business being a leader on the world stage.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
