Chuck Schumer placed the blame on President Donald Trump, and specifically his decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. But experts say that decision has had only a modest effect so far on rising prices at the pump.\n\nOne expert estimated the impact of the Iran deal on gasoline prices at \u201cmaybe 3 to 5 cents per gallon.\u201d\n\nGasoline prices have been rising fairly steadily since late 2016 when OPEC decided to curb its oil production. Experts say that is the main driver of rising prices, though there are others outside Trump\u2019s control as well.\n\nSchumer complained about the rising prices of gasoline at a May 23 press conference at an Exxon station in Washington, D.C., where a sign showed regular gas selling for $3.89 a gallon (the national average on May 21 was $2.92). The Democratic Senate leader blamed Trump for not doing more to encourage leaders in oil-rich countries and domestic oil executives to lower prices. He also blamed Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 specifically his decision to back out of the Iran deal \u2014 for helping to drive up prices at the pump.\n\n\u201cAccording to energy analysts and experts, President Trump\u2019s reckless decision to pull out of the Iran deal has led to higher oil prices,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cThese higher oil prices are translating directly to soaring gas prices, something we know disproportionately hurts middle- and lower-income people, since a larger chunk of their disposable income goes for gasoline.\u201d\n\nSchumer pointed to one analysis, from Goldman Sachs, that concluded higher oil prices were canceling the consumption benefits of the Trump-led tax cuts passed earlier this year.\n\n\u201cWhatever meager benefit working families might\u2019ve seen from Trump\u2019s tax scam for the rich is being wiped out by the gas prices that President Trump is responsible for,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nWe asked Schumer\u2019s office for backup for the claim that the decision to back out of the Iran deal \u201chas led to higher oil prices \u2026 translating directly to soaring gas prices.\u201d Schumer\u2019s office pointed to several statements from industry experts immediately before and after Trump announced his decision on May 8 to pull out of the Iran deal.\n\nFor example, just prior to Trump\u2019s announcement, Devin Gladden, a spokesman for the American Automobile Association, told Newsweek, \u201cIf sanctions are reinstated, the U.S. could see potential impact on gas prices this summer, leading to the national average ranging between $2.80 and $3.00. Any immediate impact will be to crude oil prices, which will then trickle over to retail later this summer.\u201d\n\nDan Eberhart, CEO of oilfield services company Canary LLC, echoed those concerns, saying just after Trump\u2019s announcement, \u201cWithdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal will support higher oil prices.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would have to say several dollars per barrel of what we\u2019re seeing today is due to Iran concerns,\u201d Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, told Vox just prior to Trump\u2019s announcement.\n\nWe spoke to DeHaan, and he told us Trump\u2019s decision on the Iran deal turned out to have a \u201crelatively small impact,\u201d pushing the price of crude oil up about $2 to $3 a barrel, which he said translates to \u201cmaybe 3 to 5 cents per gallon\u201d extra. That could change if the United State\u2019s allies join in the sanctions imposed by Trump, he said.\n\nOPEC\u2019s decision to limit oil production has played a far larger role in driving up gasoline prices, he said. A strong global economy also has contributed to rising prices, he said.\n\nGasoline prices were rising steadily long before Trump announced his decision to walk away from the Iran deal. Indeed, on the day Trump announced his decision, the Energy Information Administration released a short-term energy outlook that forecast a continuing rise in gasoline prices for the April\u2013September summer driving season, and it made no mention of the Iran deal.\n\nTom Kloza, an oil industry analyst and founder of the Oil Price Information Service, said Schumer is wrong to pin the blame for rising gasoline prices on Trump.\n\n\u201cPerhaps 75% of the ascent for crude oil and gasoline was tied to the usual factors; a very disciplined OPEC agreement and global demand growth that has outpaced global supply growth,\u201d Kloza told us via email. \u201cThe withdrawal from the Iranian agreement helped promote a small geopolitical risk premium on oil, as did the continued deterioration of Venezuelan oil production and refinery output.\n\n\u201cIn a sense, the rhetoric on Iran and worries about policies that hawks like Mike Pompeo and John Bolton might pursue made oil markets a bit too risky for short sellers, and these markets depend on short sellers as circuit breakers. But most of the run-up in crude and gasoline prices had roots in robust global GDP and a higher appetite for oil from emerging economies,\u201d Kloza said. \u201cThe other new factor this year has come via robust exports of U.S. crude, gasoline, and diesel fuel, but those trends are market-linked and not tied to political policy or bluster.\u201d\n\nBlaming the president for rising gasoline prices is a popular political ploy. Indeed, Trump often blamed Obama for rising gasoline prices.\n\n\u201cGas prices are at crazy levels\u2013fire Obama!\u201d Trump tweeted on Oct. 22, 2012, when the national average for regular gas was $3.69 a gallon. (See Trump\u2019s other tweets about Obama here, here, here, here, here, here and here.)\n\nFor the record, we wrote in 2011 that those attacks on Obama for rising gasoline prices were misplaced as well.\n\nSaid DeHaan: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t President Obama\u2019s fault then, and it\u2019s not President Trump\u2019s fault now.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
