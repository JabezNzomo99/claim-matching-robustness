The article cited Alexis Rodzianko, president and CEO of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia.\n\nRodzianko explained that sanctioning Deripaska\u2019s company Rusal, the world\u2019s second-largest aluminum producer, would hurt companies like the Ford Motor Company. Using the popular Ford F150 pickup truck as an example, Rodzianko said the company would not have enough aluminum to supply the market demand for that model.\n\nThe 13th-generation (2015-present) Ford F-Series pickups have an aluminum body (as opposed to steel, which was used in previous models). However, Ford does not depend on Rusal or any other foreign source of aluminum to produce these trucks.\n\n\u201cF150 is only produced in the U.S.,\u201d Christin Baker, a Ford Company spokesperson told Polygraph.info via email.\n\n\u201c95 percent of the steel and 98 percent of the aluminum used in U.S. production is sourced in the U.S.\u201d\n\nBaker said that company does not share information about its suppliers, but a little research shows that the new F150 design\u2019s aluminum comes from Novelis, which claims to be \u201cthe leading producer of flat-rolled aluminum products and the world\u2019s largest recycler of aluminum.\u201d\n\nRodzianko\u2019s choice is an interesting one, since the Ford F150 pickup truck is the most popular vehicle sold in the U.S., and one of the \u201cmost American,\u201d according to the Kogod School of Business at American University in Washington, DC.\n\nIn any case, Rodzianko\u2019s concerns may be moot, since Rusal has appealed the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s decision to sanction the company after Oleg Deripaska relinquished his controlling interest.", "lang": "en"}
