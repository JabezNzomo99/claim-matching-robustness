The image claims the only leave voter was Lord Wilson.\n\nWe cannot know this. Justices are allowed to vote, but the EU referendum, like all elections in the UK, was a secret ballot.\n\nOn top of this, all judges (also known as justices) must stay impartial when it comes to political matters. The Judicial Code of Conduct says justices must refrain from \u201cany kind of party political activity and from attendance at political gatherings\u201d or \u201ctaking part in public demonstrations which might diminish their authority as a judge or create a perception of bias in subsequent cases\u201d.\n\nThe Courts and Tribunals Judiciary guidance also states that \u201cit is of vital importance that judges are seen to be both independent and impartial\u201d.\n\nAs such, anybody claiming that they know how the justices voted needs to provide evidence of how they know this. We have seen no evidence that would support this claim.\n\nTwo of the Supreme Court judges (Lady Arden and Lord Reed) are ad hoc judges of the European Court of Human Rights. This court is not part of the EU\u2019s legal system, and separate from the Court of Justice of the European Union, which is responsible for making sure EU member countries comply with EU laws. The European Court of Human Rights doesn\u2019t have the same members as the EU\u2014for example, it includes Russia.", "lang": "en"}
