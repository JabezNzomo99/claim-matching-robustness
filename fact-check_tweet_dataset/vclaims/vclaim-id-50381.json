This is false; Saint Luke\u2019s Hospital in Kansas City did not issue the letter, according to its staff.\n\n\u201cAfter extensive research, our findings show that consuming alcoholic beverages may help reduce the risk of infection by the novel coronavirus; COVID-19. Vodka is the most recommended for drinking, cleaning, and sanitizing.\u201d\n\nThe message was displayed on what appears to be letterhead paper dated March 7, 2020, complete with the hospital\u2019s logo in the top left corner, an official stamp and a scrawled signature.\n\nThe photo was posted on several Facebook pages in the Philippines, racking up 25,000 shares in less than 24 hours. Although most Facebook users took the recommendation as a joke, Saint Luke\u2019s, in the midwestern state of Missouri, received enquiries regarding the letter, Lindsey Stitch, a hospital spokeswoman, told AFP.\n\n\u201cThe information circulating is definitely a fake letter. Vodka has no impact on the coronavirus,\u201d Stitch told AFP by email.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s Facebook page published an official debunk of the claim on March 11.\n\nStitch reiterated advice published on Saint Luke\u2019s website, recommending that people wash hands with soap and water or \u201calcohol-based hand sanitizer.\u201d The page does not recommend drinking alcoholic beverages.\n\nShe also said people should not leave home if they are feeling unwell.\n\nThe novel coronavirus has spread from China around the world, killing more than 4,500 people and wreaking havoc on the global economy.", "lang": "en"}
