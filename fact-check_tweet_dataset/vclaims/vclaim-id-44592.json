Portions of protests devolved into mayhem, with some people looting stores and burning buildings, including a police station.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet had been hidden, but viewers could still click on a link next to it to view it. The hidden tweet (below) talked about the need for authorities to get control over the protests and made reference to looting and shooting:\n\nThe quote \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts,\u201d has a dark history. In 1967, Miami Police Chief Walter Headley used the phrase during hearings about crime in the city, which prompted outrage from civil rights leaders (contrary to rumor, there is no record of former Alabama Gov. George Wallace using the phrase). Headley also referred to his approach on crime as a war on \u201cyoung hoodlums, from 15 to 21, who have taken advantage of the civil rights campaign \u2026 we don\u2019t mind being accused of police brutality.\u201d From NPR:\n\n\u201cHe had a long history of bigotry against the black community,\u201d said professor Clarence Lusane of Howard University. \u201cThe NAACP and other black organizations had for years complained about the treatment of the black community by Miami police. At this hearing, in discussing how he would deal with what he called crime and thugs and threats by young black people, he issued this statement that the reason Miami had not had any riots up to that point, was because of the message he had sent out that \u2018when the looting starts, the shooting starts,\u2019 \u201d Lusane said.\n\nTwitter elaborated on its decision to flag Trump\u2019s tweet:\n\nThis Tweet violates our policies regarding the glorification of violence based on the historical context of the last line, its connection to violence, and the risk it could inspire similar actions today. We\u2019ve taken action in the interest of preventing others from being inspired to commit violent acts, but have kept the Tweet on Twitter because it is important that the public still be able to see the Tweet given its relevance to ongoing matters of public importance.\n\nA few hours after Twitter flagged the tweet, Trump issued a clarification on the phrase, \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d:\n\nIn light of the fact that Trump did tweet about \u201clooting\u201d and \u201cshooting,\u201d and that Twitter flagged and hid the post for what it called \u201cglorifying violence,\u201d we rate this claim as \u201cTrue.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
