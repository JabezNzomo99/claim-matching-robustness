Like her, let's not ask what my dad can do for us, let's ask what we can do for my dad.\"\n\nSeveral Facebook users have posted the message, believing it to be from the US President's daughter and presidential adviser.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the viral claim to be false. Ivanka did make a separate tweet appreciating the girl from Bihar's Darbhanga district. But the viral message is a meme taken from a parody account.\n\nThe archived versions of the posts can be seen here and here.\n\nFifteen-year-old Jyoti Kumar had hit the headlines in May after she cycled 1,200 kms from Gurugram to Darbhanga in seven days, carrying her injured father during the lockdown.\n\nIvanka had indeed tweeted about the incident, lauding Jyoti's \"endurance & love\".\n\nBut the viral message saying, \"let's not ask what my dad can do for us, let's ask what we can do for my dad\" has been inspired by former US President John F Kennedy's famous speech from 1961, where he said, \"Ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country.\"\n\nInternational fact-check website Snopes had found that the wording of this putative quote reproduced in the viral meme was taken from the Tucker Carlson parody account on Twitter.\n\nHence, it is concluded that the viral quote, wherein she gave the example of the Bihar girl who cycled 1,200 kms during lockdown carrying her injured father, to hit out at critics, has been falsely attributed to Ivanka Trump.", "lang": "en"}
