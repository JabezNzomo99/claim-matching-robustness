Text above the photo says, \"Elite/Hollywood figures on house arrest with ankle monitors, due to child trafficking crimes.\"\n\nThe post attempts to prove this by revealing that all are wearing ankle bracelets in the images.\n\nBut some of the photos are obscured, while others were digitally altered. One image accurately shows ankle wear on Obama, but it\u2019s not a house arrest monitor.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nFirst, there is no evidence that Obama, Winfrey, DeGeneres or Clinton are involved in child trafficking and none have been arrested, or placed on house arrest, for any crime.\n\nThe photos of DeGeneres and Winfrey are both obscured and show bulges underneath their pants, near their ankles. This is far from proving these are house arrest monitors, and we couldn\u2019t track down the original images. Winfrey also addressed false rumors in March that she had been arrested.\n\nThe photo of Hillary Clinton was taken in 2014 in the Hamptons. The Facebook post\u2019s version was digitally altered to include a device on her right leg. Clinton is not wearing any kind of bracelet or monitor, on either leg, in the original photo or in other photos from that day.\n\nThe photo of Obama shows him paddle boarding in January 2020 in Hawaii. The bracelet on his ankle is real, but it\u2019s not a house arrest monitor. The device is called a \"SharkBanz,\" which uses technology to deter a shark attack. (Note: It\u2019s difficult to be on house arrest and also paddleboard in Hawaii).\n\nWe rate this Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
