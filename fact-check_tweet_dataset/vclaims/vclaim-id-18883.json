No, that&#039;s not true. The story...", "author": "leadstories.com", "date": "2019-08-20T14:46:19-07:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-18883", "url": "https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2019/08/fake-news-trump-files-lawsuit-to-deport-george-soros.html", "vclaim": "Did President Trump file a lawsuit to have George Soros deported from the country? No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to fool Trump supporters and Republicans into sharing made up stories that are clearly marked as satire when you actually click them. Articles from the site are frequently copied by foreign-run fake news websites. The people liking and sharing these stories are enriching foreign website operators (or a liberal from Maine) via the ad revenue generated with the content which is probably not what they expected or wanted.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Daily World Update on August 5, 2019 titled \"Trump Files Lawsuit To Deport George Soros\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nCiting his crimes against humanity in World War Two, his consistent manipulation of world markets to further enrich himself, and his continued assault on the values of the average American, President Donald Jabroni Trump has initiated proceedings to further a lawsuit aimed at having evil, villainous, omniscient, criminal mastermind George Soros, deported from the United States back to his native European country that changes depending on which ever-trustworthy \"journalistic source\" tells the story of his life, and here he shared a few thoughts on the matter: \"George Snuffaluffagus Soros has spent decades terrorizing the world with his forced economic policy on lesser nations than ours, his manipulation of world money markets to satisfy his lusty greed, his opposition to powerful, magnificent governments such as my own, and his construction of coups to dethrone the rich, powerful, and vicious despots installed by America throughout the world, all of which has come together in a pattern reminiscent of past treasonous activities from past traitors, and so we have decided to act by having this horrible, disgusting piece of human excrement deported from these United States of America through a lawsuit filed today.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe story was posted under the category \"Satire and/or Conservative Fan Fiction, Spooky Scary Soros Conspiracy Satire\" and sported multiple satire disclaimers besides being stuffed to the gills with hints that the story was not true (\"Donald Jabroni Trump\", really?). Despite this the story was readily copied by several sites (likely foreign run) that presented it as news.\n\nThe site is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run byself-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other fact checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction to this he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry extremely visible disclaimers everywhere.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nHere is a video of Blair explaining how his process works:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes dailyworldupdate.us as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
