It\u2019s currently \u00a39.75 in London and \u00a38.45 across the rest of the UK.\n\nMr Corbyn\u2019s office said he used figures from the foundation itself, which seems to use estimates from KPMG. Its press release says that there were 5.84 million people earning less than the living wage in 2014.\n\nBut one of the report\u2019s authors confirmed to us that it actually refers to the number of jobs.\n\nSo that\u2019s not quite the same as six million people because some people have more than one job. It\u2019s previously been estimated that 5.4 million people with one job earned less than the living wage in 2014.\n\nMeanwhile, Theresa May is talking about the government\u2019s National Living Wage, and she's correct that the government introduced this. It effectively boosted the existing minimum wage for the over-25s.\n\nIt's currently \u00a37.20 across the UK. Anyone under the age of 25 can earn anything from from \u00a33.40 to \u00a36.95 as minimum, depending on their age.\n\nIn April 2016, when the National Living Wage was first introduced, there were 362,000 jobs which earned less than \u00a37.20. That\u2019s 1.3% of all jobs at the time.", "lang": "en"}
