It never said that the United States was listening in on bin Laden, as Sanders claimed. The writer, Martin Sieff, told The Washington Post in 2005 that the information about the phone was \u201calready in the public domain\u201d when he wrote the story.\n\nIt was not until Sept. 7, 1998, that a newspaper reported that the United States had intercepted his phone calls and obtained his voiceprint. U.S. authorities \u201cused their communications intercept capacity to pick up calls placed by bin Laden on his Inmarsat satellite phone, despite his apparent use of electronic \u2018scramblers,\u2019 \u201d the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nOfficials who had cited the supposed leak could not explain in 2005 why they focused on the Washington Times story when other news organizations at the same time reported on the satellite phone \u2014 and that the information was not particularly newsworthy.\n\nLee H. Hamilton, vice chairman of the Sept. 11 commission, gave a speech in October 2005 in which he said the leak \u201cwas terribly damaging.\u201d He said the commission relied on the testimony of three \u201cvery responsible, very senior intelligence officers,\u201d who he said \u201clinked the Times story to the cessation of the use of the phone.\u201d He said they described it as a very serious leak.\n\nBut Hamilton said he did not recall any discussion about other news outlets\u2019 reports. \u201cI cannot conceive we would have singled out the Washington Times if we knew about all of the reporting,\u201d he said.", "lang": "en"}
