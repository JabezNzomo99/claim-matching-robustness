According to NDTV, the father of the children was married twice. He had four sons from the first marriage and another son from the second. All the five children were found dead in a well in Barwana district. The parents of the children were absconding and the police suspected that they might have a role to play in the death of the children who died due to drowning.\n\nWe found that the second and third images of injured people depict an incident that recently took place in Madhya Pradesh. The trio, mistaken to be child-kidnappers, was attacked by a mob in Gwalior. The case was reported by Dainik Bhaskaron August 8.\n\nThe incident was also reported by Nai Dunia . According to the reports, a sadhu and two of his disciples were approached by two bike-borne men who accused them of being child-kidnappers. Soon after, a huge mob gathered and attacked the trio. They punched and kicked them when two cops from Bahodapur police station intervened. But the enraged mob also beat up the policemen who had to call for back-up. Only after more police personnel arrived at the spot that the mob was dispersed and the trio did not lose their lives to false accusations of being child-lifters.\n\nThe last image has already been debunked by Alt News in July. The image in question does not represent child-kidnappers but a sex racket gang that was nabbed in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe incident was reported by Patrika.\n\nIn conclusion, two unrelated images and a photograph of an incident where individuals were beaten on false suspicions of being child-lifters were shared to falsely claim that child-kidnappers are on a prowl and are lifting children to sell their kidneys.\n\nAlt News has debunked earlier cases of similar rumours in the video posted below.", "lang": "en"}
