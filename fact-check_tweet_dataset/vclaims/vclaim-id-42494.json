Peskov said the report included \u201cgroundless accusations\u201d that he attributed to \u201cRussophobia,\u201d a common Kremlin refrain.\n\nEUvsDisinfo is a project of the European Union's East StratCom Task Force, formed in 2015 in response to Russian disinformation campaigns. The report in question was published on March 16 and headlined: \u201cThe Kremlin and Disinformation About Coronavirus.\u201d It described how Russian media outlets push contradictory infornation, alternately portraying COVID-19 as little more dangerous than the common flu and predicting it will destroy civilization.\n\nThe report also described Russian media conspiracy theories claiming the U.S. government engineered the virus in a biological weapons laboratory.\n\nPeskov claimed the EUvs Disinfo report contained no \u201cexamples, nor did it cite \u201cspecific news outlets.\u201d\n\nEUvsDisinfo, a service of the European Union to expose fake news, provides direct links to the articles identified as disinformation. The links show that in some cases, official Russian state-owned media outlets have pushed the deceptive narratives.\n\nFor example, Sputnik\u2019s affiliate in Belarus published a story claiming the virus is an \u201cAnglo-Saxon\u201d plot to counter China. EUvsDisinfo also cited a report by Sputnik\u2019s affiliate in South Ossetia, a breakaway region of Georgia occupied by Russian troops, which claimed the epidemic had been turned into a \u201cweapon\u201d for \u201cinformation warfare\u201d by the West.\n\nIn another case, Sputnik\u2019s Armenian affiliate put out a story claiming, without any evidence, that the COVID-19 virus was created in a U.S. laboratory. Sputnik Latvia ran an article suggesting the virus could have originated in Latvia.\n\nEUvsDisinfo also cited disinformation that appeared on websites that are not owned by the Russian government but regularly promote Kremlin talking points.\n\nThis includes Geopolitica.ru, associated with the far-right Russian propagandist Alexander Dugin. The EUvsDisinfo site\u2019s search function allows users to determine if false claims came from an officially state-owned media outlet.\n\nUnderstanding how Russian state media leaders view their responsibilities helps explain why this disinformation is seen as a threat, especially in Europe. In 2012, for example, RT (Russia Today) editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan described her network\u2019s role in military terms, as a form of information warfare.\n\n Simonyan told the Russian newspaper Kommersant that the Russian taxpayer needs RT for the same reason they need the country\u2019s defense ministry.\n\nDmitry Kiselyov, who heads Sputnik\u2019s parent agency, has expressed similar sentiments, declaring the era of neutral journalism \u201cover.\u201d\n\nDespite the \u201cRussophobia\u201d rebuttals, there is evidence the Russian government takes disinformation about the coronavirus seriously \u2013 at least, in Russia.\n\nOn March 19, RT reported that a woman in Russia\u2019s Far East was being charged for spreading false information about the virus. According to local police, she had \u201cdisseminated facts about coronavirus that did not correspond to reality.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
