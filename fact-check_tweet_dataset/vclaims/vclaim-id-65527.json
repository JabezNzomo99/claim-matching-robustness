It is being claimed that the video shows a \u2018failed missile test\u2019 conducted by India.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above post and found that the claim attached to the video is FAKE.\n\nWe extracted the keyframes of the video through InVid and put them through Reverse Image Search. The search led us to the extended version of the same video on YouTube dated July 31, 2013.\n\nOn closely analysing the audio, we noticed the dialect of the people talking in the background which establishes that the video is NOT from India.\n\nThough the description of the video suggested that the video is of a failed rocket launch in North Korea, however, we saw several comments claiming it to be from Russia.\n\nOn digging further, we ran a search using keywords (not keyword) such as \u2018Rocket\u2019, \u2018crash\u2019, \u2018Russia\u2019, which led us to the video of the same incident from the different angle posted by The Telegraph on their official YouTube channel on July 1, 2013.\n\nThe report suggested that a Russian Proton-M rocket carrying three navigation satellites crashed (not crashes) soon after takeoff from Kazakhstan\u2019s Baikonur Cosmodrome.\n\nIn conclusion, the above information proves that the video in question has no connection with India and is seven-years-old.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
