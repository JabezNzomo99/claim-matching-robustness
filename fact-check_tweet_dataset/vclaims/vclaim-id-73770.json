Additionally, prosecutors believe she manipulated about 300, not 400, ballot applications.\n\nJanet Reed of Indiana is a member of the Vanderburgh County Democratic Party's precinct committee. She was arrested on suspicion of partially filling out applications for ballots in the state's June 2020 primary election such that voters who used them would have no option but to participate in the state's Democratic primary. Election officials said they caught the modification and reissued new applications to impacted voters.\n\nIn the months before the 2020 November election, supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump circulated a meme online that alleged an Indiana woman had been arrested on suspicion of filling out more than 400 mail-in ballots for candidates of her choice \u2014 all Democrats.\n\nAround the same time, Trump had made several unsubstantiated attacks on the legitimacy of vote-by-mail systems in his race against Democratic rival and former Vice President Joe Biden. The viral meme shown above appeared to be an attempt to provide evidence of the polling method\u2019s susceptibility to fraud, including a mugshot of the alleged offender and the claim:\n\nMore than 400 Facebook accounts had shared a version of the image (see below) as of this writing, including a user who added the commentary: \u201cThese illegal things by the Left/Democrats will continue after the election too.\u201d\n\nTo investigate the accuracy of the viral rumor, we deemed its underlying claim to be this: Janet Reed, a Democratic activist in Indiana, was arrested in 2020 on suspicion of preselecting Democratic candidates on more than 400 mail-in ballots.\n\nWe uncovered legal filings in Vanderburgh Circuit Court that confirmed, yes, a woman named Janet Reed of Evansville, Indiana, faced a felony election fraud charge in a case that was filed on April 15, 2020.\n\nNext, we contacted the Vanderburgh County Sheriff\u2019s Office to learn the circumstances that led to Reed\u2019s arrest. Major Chad Ferguson sent us a copy of the affidavit of probable cause, which is a court document that outlines officers\u2019 rationale for arresting suspects and is often the basis of prosecutors\u2019 arguments for charging them. The document, which included information from the Vanderburgh County Election Board, stated:\n\nIn other words, Reed was arrested on suspicion of manipulating hundreds of applications for ballots \u2014 not actual ballots for selecting specific candidates on Election Day \u2014 to vote in the state\u2019s June 2020 primary elections. Untainted applications (as shown below) gave registered voters the option of identifying as a Democrat or Republican, or only voting on nonpartisan ballot measures, in the primaries.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, Reed had illegally used a yellow highlighting pen to preselect the \u201cDemocratic Party\u201d option on about 300 applications that would have signed up recipients for the state\u2019s Democratic primary on June 2, 2020, without their consent.\n\nBut per investigators, the tainted applications were returned to the Vanderburgh County Election Office and were deemed invalid. The affidavit did not make clear under what circumstances recipients returned the ballots, nor how many voters noticed the infraction right away. At least a portion of recipients tried submitting the invalid applications for ballots, but election officials said they were aware of Reed\u2019s alleged actions by that time and reissued those voters new applications to complete. The document stated:\n\nThat meant the roughly 300 voters who returned the manipulated paperwork to elections officials were able to select either the Democratic or Republican party, or neither, on new applications for primary ballots, according to officials.\n\nAdditionally, the affidavit said election officials and the chair of the county\u2019s Democratic Party, Edie Hardcastle confronted Reed about her fraudulent activity in spring 2020 and demanded her to immediately stop sending applications. She didn\u2019t, the document alleged, and she also did not cooperate with detectives\u2019 investigation into the case.\n\nPer the court records, prosecutors charged Reed with a Level 6 felony. Ultimately, they believed Reed violated Indiana\u2019s law governing ballot applications, which are statutes that not only pertain to mail-in voting systems but rather all methods of voting. Reed\u2019s next court hearing was scheduled for October 8, 2020, as of this report.\n\nProsecutor Nick Hermann, a former local Republican Party chairman, declined an interview with us for this report.\n\nSo to recap, Vanderburgh County law enforcement and elections officials believed Reed had partially completed ballot applications for about 300 eligible voters as part of an illegal scheme to drive up turnout in the state\u2019s Democratic primary election, which is where party voters narrowed crowded races to one leading candidate.\n\nNext, we sought any evidence to prove or disprove that Reed was a \u201cDemocratic activist\u201d or that she had volunteered in any way to promote the party\u2019s causes or candidates. In an email to Snopes, Hardcastle said:\n\nFurthermore, Hardcastle told Evansville\u2019s local newspaper The Courier & Press that Reed had worked for the campaign of Thomasina Marsili, a Democratic newcomer who won the primary and was running against Republican Rep. Larry Bucshon to represent Indiana\u2019s 8th Congressional District as of this writing. Marsili told the newspaper that Reed was \u201cnot an employee\u201d but the candidate did not respond to questions to clarify if Reed was volunteering for the campaign.\n\nIn sum, it is accurate to claim that Reed, who is a member of her county\u2019s Democratic Party\u2019s precinct committee, was arrested in 2020 on suspicion of partially filling out about 300 ballot applications that would have signed up recipients for the state\u2019s Democratic primary without their consent. However, elections officials say they caught the error and reissued impacted voters new applications to request ballots for the political party of their choosing or to abstain from voting in partisan primary races. Additionally, it is false to assert she faced a criminal charge for allegedly preselecting Democratic candidates on numerous residents\u2019 ballots. For those reasons, we rate this claim a \u201cMixture\u201d of truth and falsehood.", "lang": "en"}
