The Facebook user who posted the message wrote on her bio: \u201cNope, not THAT Serena Williams \ud83d\udc8d Justin\u2019s wifey & Bentley\u2019s mommy \ud83d\udc15\u201d\n\nAlthough not-tennis-Serena posted this message to her Facebook page on June 14, she is not the original author of this post. It appears that this message first started circulating on June 2 when it was shared (and presumably written) by Facebook user Gina Torres:\n\nIn short, the viral message was written by a Facebook user named \u201cGina\u201d at the start of June 2020. The message went viral a few weeks later when a woman named \u201cSerena Williams\u201d shared this message and internet users mistook it for a post from the famous tennis star.", "lang": "en"}
