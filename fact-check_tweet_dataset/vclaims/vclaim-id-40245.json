But it seems likely from this poll that support for independence is above 10%.\n\nAnother poll earlier this year from ICM for BBC Wales found support at just 7%, but this is because people were asked their preference out of a range of options, which included further powers for the Welsh Assembly. So this result can\u2019t be used to estimate what the result of a Welsh independence referendum, where the options would most likely be either independence or remaining in the UK.", "lang": "en"}
