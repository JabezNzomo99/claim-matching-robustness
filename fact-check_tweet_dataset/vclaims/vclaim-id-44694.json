She added a link to a report in the Times Educational Supplement.\n\nIn fact, this report describes the conclusions of \u201cthe Independent SAGE\u201d, a different group of scientists, who did decide that there was not enough evidence to say that it was safe to open schools\n\nLater, in response to a message from another Twitter user, Ms Rayner accepted this point, saying, \u201cas it says in the report it\u2019s the Independent SAGE Committee, happy to clarify.\u201d\n\nShe has since deleted both tweets.\n\nWhich is the real SAGE?\n\nThe official Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, or SAGE, is a group of leading experts both from within government and from outside, which is convened by the Cabinet Office during an emergency. It is \u201cresponsible for ensuring that timely and coordinated scientific advice is made available to decision makers\u201d.\n\nSAGE is currently chaired by the Government Chief Scientific Adviser, who is currently Sir Patrick Vallance and co-chaired by the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty.\n\nSAGE was first convened during the swine flu pandemic in 2009 and has advised on the volcanic ash emergency in 2010, the winter flooding in 2013, the Ebola outbreak in 2014, and several other emergencies.\n\nDepartmental chief scientific advisers and independent experts take part in SAGE meetings. Different experts are invited to different meetings, depending on the subject. \u201cWe also include people who may need to act on the advice,\u201d Sir Patrick said during a press briefing on 27 April, \u201cso in this case we include the NHS in this as well.\u201d Various specialist sub-groups also contribute research.\n\nUntil recently, the details of SAGE meetings and the names of the people who took part in them were not made public until after the emergency had ended. In the 27 April press briefing, Sir Patrick explained that this was intended to protect participants from public pressure, and for their own personal security. During this pandemic, however, SAGE has begun to publish more of this information, including minutes of meetings, most of the experts\u2019 names and some of the research they considered.\n\nOn 24 April, the Guardian reported that the Prime Minister\u2019s chief political adviser Dominic Cummings had attended SAGE meetings. During the 27 April press briefing, Sir Patrick said: \u201cWe also have officials from Whitehall, who listen in to the meetings and can ask questions if they wish to, but they\u2019re not part of the general discussion\u2026. Yes that does include people from Number 10. And yes, occasionally they ask questions.\u201d\n\nSome of the research about schools which SAGE considered has been published, but not the advice they produced.\n\nWho are the Independent SAGE?\n\nOn 4 May, a different group of experts convened, calling themselves the Independent SAGE. This group is not part of the civil service or the government. The Independent SAGE says that it aims \u201cto provide robust, independent advice to HM Government with the purpose of helping the UK navigate COVID-19 whilst minimising fatalities\u201d.\n\nIts organisers say that, \u201cthe activities of the [official SAGE] committee have been kept secret and excluded from scrutiny by the public or wider scientific community.\u201d\n\nThe Independent SAGE is chaired by Sir David King, who was the Government Chief Scientific Adviser between 2000 and 2008. It currently lists 12 members on its website.\n\nMeetings of the Independent SAGE are broadcast live.\n\nThe Independent SAGE published a discussion document about schools on 22 May, and its full report on 28 May.", "lang": "en"}
