This is our capability. Swayamsewak will be ready to take on the front if the country faces such a situation and Constitution permits to do so),\u201d Press Trust of India (PTI) reported him to have said.\n\nThis was picked up by other Hindi and English news outlets.\n\nCongress President Rahul Gandhi also used it as an opportunity to take aim at the RSS and said Bhagwat's statement was 'an insult to every Indian.'\n\n\"Bhagwat ji had said that if situation arises and the Constitution permits, Indian army would take 6 months to prepare the society whereas Sangh swayamsevaks can be trained in 3 days, as Swayamsevaks practise discipline regularly,\" Dr.Manmohan Vaidya said in a press release.\n\nBOOM does not have access to Mohan Bhagwat's entire speech. We listened to the video tweeted by the RSS. Below is a verbatim transcript and translation.\n\n'Ours is not a military group. (But) we have military-like discipline. If the nation requires it. (And) if the Constitution permits then army will take 6-7 months to get ready. (If) (Sanghate Shansako) our workers are taken, it will take 3 days. That is our capability. But we are not a military group. Not even a para-military group. We are a family organisation.'\n\nWhile Bhagwat's reference of the word 'sena' is open to interpretation it appears that he was not comparing the Indian army to the RSS. On reading the transcript it appears he meant that if the Indian Army recruited RSS workers it would take three days to train such workers.\n\nThis is in line with what Rakesh Sinha from the RSS tweeted.", "lang": "en"}
