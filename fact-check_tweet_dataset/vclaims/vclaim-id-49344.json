His wife of 63 years at the time of his death in 2013 was Barbara, a former assistant dean at Seton Hall Law School.\n\nMaxwell\u2019s parents were Robert Maxwell, a British publishing giant, and Elisabeth Maxwell, who was born in France and established a scholarly journal called Holocaust and Genocide Studies.\n\nElisabeth Maxwell was born Elisabeth Jenny Jeanne Meynard.
