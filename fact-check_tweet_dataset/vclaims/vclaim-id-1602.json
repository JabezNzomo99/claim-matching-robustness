We\u2019ve found problems with both claims and Simon Stevens, the head of NHS England, told MPs only yesterday that:\n\n\u201cI think it would be stretching it to say that the NHS has got more than it asked for\u201d.\n\nThe Times\u2019 Sam Coates commented on Twitter that, in defending itself from this criticism, the government has edited comments by Mr Stevens from 2015.\n\nThe claim from Downing Street that\u2019s currently circulating states:\n\n\"The figures speak for themselves, and they will see an increase in real terms of \u00a310 billion. And at the time the NHS England chief executive said 'the settlement is a clear and highly welcome acceptance of our argument. Our case for the NHS has been heard and actively supported.\"\n\nDowning Street confirmed to us this is what was said to journalists in a briefing yesterday.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all of what Mr Stevens said in 2015. Here are his comments at the time, as they were published:\n\n\u201cThis settlement is a clear and highly welcome acceptance of our argument for frontloaded NHS investment. It will help stabilise current pressures on hospitals, GPs, and mental health services, and kick start the NHS Five Year Forward View\u2019s fundamental redesign of care. \u201cIn the context of constraints on overall public spending, our case for the NHS has been heard and actively supported.\u201d\n\nMr Stevens mentions that he was happy that NHS investment was \u201cfrontloaded\u201d. That means providing more of the NHS\u2019 funding in the early years of parliament and less money later on, as the government plans to do.", "lang": "en"}
