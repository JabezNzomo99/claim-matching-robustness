Trey Gowdy said, \u201cNobody has the right to serve in the military.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence Gowdy ever made this statement. It likely got linked to him after a Gowdy fan page posted it on social media.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced on Twitter July 26, 2017, that the country would no longer \u201caccept or allow\u201d transgender individuals to serve in the military. The modified policy, which took effect in April of this year, bars people seeking treatment for gender dysphoria from enlisting and requires military personnel to serve as their biological gender, with a few exceptions. It is being challenged in court, according to NBC News.\n\nThe Facebook post, which has been shared more than 92,000 times, alleges that Gowdy gave a statement defending the transgender military ban in an interview with a CNN reporter. It is accompanied by a photo of Gowdy. (RELATED: Will Sonic The Hedgehog Be Transgender In An Upcoming Movie?)\n\n\u201cThe Military has one job: Winning War. Anything else is a distraction and a liability,\u201d reads part of Gowdy\u2019s alleged statement. \u201cDid someone just scream? That isn\u2019t Fair? War is VERY unfair, there are no exceptions made for being special or challenged or socially wonderful. YOU must change yourself to meet Military standards and not the other way around.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no evidence Gowdy ever said or wrote the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. A search of CNN\u2019s website and Grabien, a video clip editing service, didn\u2019t turn up any instances of Gowdy making this statement about the transgender military ban. No credible online sources link him to it either.\n\n\u201cNever wrote a word of it,\u201d said Gowdy in a phone interview with the Daily Caller. \u201cNot one single solitary word came from me. I never addressed the topic.\u201d\n\nThe statement, debunked by TruthOrFiction.com in 2017, likely got attributed to Gowdy after the Trey Gowdy News and Support Facebook page shared it in July 2017, even though the account disclaims that it has no affiliation with Gowdy. Prior to the statement being linked to Gowdy, variations appeared in online discussion forums without attribution.", "lang": "en"}
