The claim is false; the video -- which has been previously debunked by AFP Fact Check -- actually shows students throwing water over each other at an initiation event at a university in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe video was posted to Facebook here on August 7, 2019, where it has been viewed more than 22,000 times.\n\nThe posts have a caption saying: \n\n \u201cThe situation of Muslims women in india right now .\n\n Where is Muslim Ummah, where is Peacekeepers. \n\n Our sisters are put to disgrace mercilessly, they hurting thier faith .\n\n #PrayForKashmir \n\n #KashmirBleedsUNsleeps \n\n #HumanRightsWatch\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe video was also posted on August 7, 2019, on Facebook here, where it has been viewed 19,000 times, alongside an identical claim.\n\nThe video has also been shared in other Facebook posts, for example here and here, which claim it was filmed in Kashmir and depicts the harassment of Muslim women by Indians. The captions in both posts say: \u201cThis is how Muslims girls are been treated in Kashmir by Hindus.\u201d\n\nAFP previously debunked this exact same footage on March 15, 2019, after it was published and viewed extensively alongside false claims that it showed members of a Hindu nationalist group in India torturing Muslim women.\n\nThe footage was actually taken at a university initiation event in eastern Sri Lanka.\n\nA Facebook page called Lanka Sun News shared the same video here on February 24, 2019, accompanied by claims it showed a \u201cragging\u201d or initiation incident at the Eastern University in Vantharumoolai, in eastern Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Tamil-language text in the caption accompanying the video states: \u201cPlease watch this, and share this... Sri Lankan Eastern\u201d.\n\nTamil language is spoken in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu and in Sri Lanka.\n\nA journalist from AFP\u2019s Colombo bureau analysed the footage and found that the people in the misleading clip can be heard speaking Sri Lankan Tamil language.\n\nAt one point in the video, a person can be heard asking their friends to splash water at them, saying: \u201cFetch it and splash it.\u201d\n\nThe video also received coverage from Puthithu, a news website run by Sri Lankan Tamils living abroad, in a report published on February 24, 2019.\n\nThe news site said it had confirmed with Eastern University students that the video was filmed on their campus.\n\nTranslated from Tamil, the Puthithu report\u2019s headline reads: \u201cCondemnation of attacks against eastern uni female students.\u201d\n\nA translated version of the article reads in part: \u201cA video of a large number of female students being chased by some male students and dousing them with water has gone viral on Facebook. The senior students of the university have behaved this way towards the freshman students, said those who wrote about the video. Puthithu has confirmed with students of the Eastern University that the incident took place at the university.\u201d\n\nBelow is a translated screenshot of the Puthithu report:\n\n\n\nAFP analysed the location of the video and cross-referenced it with images from the Eastern University in Vantharumoolai.\n\nA video on the official YouTube channel for the Eastern University in Sri Lanka shows a road lined with trees at 0:39.\n\nThe scene also shows burqa-clad women walking along the road. The road and surrounding trees on the campus correspond with the terrain seen in the misleading video shared on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nBelow is a screenshot from the official university video (L) next to a screenshot from the misleading video (R):\n\n\n\nThese scenes also correspond with a street level photo on Mapillary tagged to a location on the Eastern University campus.\n\nHere is a screenshot from Mapillary of the university campus:\n\nHere is the location on Mapillary.", "lang": "en"}
