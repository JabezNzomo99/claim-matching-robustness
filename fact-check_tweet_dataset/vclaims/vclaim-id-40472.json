Yet Bolduc\u2019s campaign has suggested he was a member of the famous \u201chorse soldiers\u201d depicted in a Hollywood movie \u2014 and done little to correct the record when the news media has inaccurately reported this claim.\n\nBolduc\u2019s announcement video plays on this history. There are video clips of Fox News anchors discussing ODA 595. Stanton is quoted. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld holds up a famous photo of ODA 595 on its horses, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a picture of them on horseback.\u201d Finally, an image of the iconic statue of an ODA 595 soldier on horseback, located at the 9/11 memorial at Ground Zero in New York, is shown. (The statue is dedicated to all America\u2019s Special Operations forces and their response to 9/11.)\n\nBolduc arrived there late in November, near the city of Kandahar, as a member of Special Operations Command and Control Element (SOCCE) 52, which had tactical control of ODAs 574 and 583, according to \u201cA Different Kind of War,\u201d an Army history published in 2010. Rather than riding horses, he traveled in a vehicle convoy with a force led by Hamid Karzai, the future leader of Afghanistan. \u201cAs the motley group moved south over the bumpy roads, individual trucks and cars continually raced up on the berm to see Karzai in person,\u201d the history recounted. Bolduc is quoted as saying: \u201cIt was crazy because [the Afghans] didn\u2019t understand convoy operations.\u201d\n\nThe other photo is dated Jan. 16, 2011, and was taken in Uruzgan province, according to the U.S. Special Operations Command website. The video crops out a man wearing modern gear and yellows the photograph to make it appear old. This picture appears in the video just after Rumsfeld holds up the photo of ODA 595 on horseback and before an announcer says: \u201cIt was the beginning of an amazing military operation.\u201d\n\nNutsch said he thought the honorific \u201chorse soldiers\u201d was coined by the military. But Stanton said \u201cMark is wrong \u2014 dead wrong.\u201d The phrase was the brainchild of Stanton\u2019s book editor, Colin Harrison at Scribner. \u201cColin deserves at least 98 percent of the credit for coming up with the title,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought the book title would take off that way.\u201d\n\nBolduc\u2019s campaign dismissed questions about the photos in the video. \u201cDon Bolduc and his team used every resource available to them from the outset of their operation, including horseback,\u201d said senior adviser Josh McElveen. \u201cThat he didn\u2019t save more pictures is an indication of fighting a war, instead of sightseeing.\u201d He added that \u201cat no time has General Bolduc stated or insinuated that his operation was the focus of the Hollywood retelling, and he is quick to correct those who conflate the horse soldiers moniker and the movie.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have always stipulated that I was in the south with Karzai and not part of the team in the North. I was part of the original teams in Afghanistan that used horses, donkeys, Toyota pick up trucks, and Toyota Corollas, and jingle trucks. My comments are well documented here in NH,\u201d Bolduc said. \u201cThe book is not a comprehensive history of all the teams in Afghanistan. Neither the book or the movie depicted any teams outside of the teams in the north and east of Afghanistan fighting against the Northern Alliance. The Fact Checker is going down a rabbit hole that has no rabbit.\u201d\n\nBut where the video goes wrong is that it so closely associates Bolduc with the ODA 595 legend that viewers may assume his exploits were depicted in a Hollywood movie. The photo trickery in the ad is no accident. Clearly it was effective enough that some reporters have taken the bait \u2014 and the Bolduc campaign does not appear to have corrected the record. However, we found no evidence of Bolduc himself embellishing the story when specifically asked about it.", "lang": "en"}
