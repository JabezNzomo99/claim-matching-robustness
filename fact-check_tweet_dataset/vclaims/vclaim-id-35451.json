If WADA finds Moscow\u2019s response to its inquiry insufficient or that Russia intentionally forged the data before granting the WADA investigators access to the Moscow lab\u2019s computers and servers, the penalties for Russian sports could be severe, including a ban on Russia\u2019s National Olympic and Paralympic Committees.\n\nYuri Ganus, the CEO of RUSADA, Russia\u2019s anti-doping agency, said this situation puts the nation\u2019s sports on the verge of an \u201cabyss.\u201d In an unprecedented move, Ganus published an open letter calling Russia\u2019s response to the data manipulation inquiry \u201clies and propaganda,\u201d saying his agency had nothing to do with the alleged data forgery.\n\n\u201cAn avalanche of lies grows daily, which is used to hide the true reasons of the anti-doping campaign failure,\u201d Ganus wrote. \u201c\u2026 [T]he media space of Russian sports is gradually filled with lies about the situation with database changes, covering those, who brought our sport out to the doping crisis standstill. What opinion can be formed when the media space is filled with materials, which are obviously sponsored? Is there nothing else to answer WADA on Moscow laboratory database distortions? So let's fill the space with appropriate false content of loyal media?\u201d\n\nIn an interview with the Izvestia daily, Ganus said the discrepancies in the data discovered by WADA could not be accidental.\n\n\u201cThe amount of data that was transferred by the Russian side to WADA representatives in January cannot be changed with one random click,\u201d Ganus said.\n\nThat claim is likely true.\n\nWhile WADA did not fully detail the data its investigators retrieved from Moscow, bits of information from the agency\u2019s reports show that Ganus was correct in saying the data breach could not have been accidental.\n\nIn a July 2 progress report on its Russia investigation, WADA said its intelligence had identified a \u201ctarget pool\u201d of 298 athletes representing 578 samples with the most suspicious data. It also said WADA\u2019s Intelligence and Investigations Team had provided an estimated 500 gigabytes of data from the Moscow laboratory to the International Association of Athletics Federations\u2019 Athletic Integrity Unit. It was in this report that WADA first disclosed its problems with the Russian data.\n\n\u201cWhile much has been achieved since the data and samples were retrieved, a lot of highly technical and protracted work remains in collaboration with leading experts in digital forensics. This includes examining some differences identified between the LIMS database provided by a whistleblower in October 2017 and the version WADA I&I removed from the laboratory in January 2019, and any impact that these may have on bringing cases forward,\u201d the report stated.\n\nIn a September 23 progress report, WADA said its investigators had identified only 47 cases that were \u201cunaffected and contained no inconsistencies in the data.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower database WADA referred to led to what has become known as the McLaren Report, concerning allegations and evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia, after which an investigation was launched into \u201cinstitutionalized manipulation of the doping control process\u201d in Russian sports.\n\nWhile the Russian sports authorities continue to deny any wrongdoing, Ganus\u2019s criticism has been sympathetically received by some in the Russian media.\n\nThe famous Russian TV journalist and commentator Vladimir Posner said he was very concerned by the situation.\n\n\u201cDoes it bother you that in the event the fraudulent activity is confirmed, the whole world will point a finger at Russia and say that we are deceivers and cannot be trusted? And this, of course, will apply not only to sports. It worries me very much!\u201d Posner wrote on Instagram.", "lang": "en"}
