No legitimate news organization has reported on the Foo Fighters frontman recently getting sick, much less contracting COVID-19.\n\nIts source -- a \u201cBild newspaper\u201d -- also lends no truth to Noticiasrge\u2019s claim.\n\nThe German tabloid had previously featured him but the last story it published on the former Nirvana drummer was of him falling off a stage in January 2019 during a concert in Las Vegas. Grohl was briefly mentioned in three more stories that March, June and August, but nothing about him being sick.\n\nAnother claim lacking proof, the site said Grohl was in Russia \u201cfor a solo project\u201d before returning to America a month prior to the post's publishing date.\n\nA look at various social media sites and queries on search engine operators does not turn up results placing Grohl in Russia recently. Where online records placed him instead was in Hawaii, performing from his home for an iHeartRadio Living Room concert on March 29.\n\nHis most recent public appearance was in an April 27 episode of American late night show Jimmy Kimmel Live, where he serenaded an emergency nurse via an online call as a tribute to frontliners. On May 13, Entertainment Weekly published an interview with him where they discussed what he was doing during the community quarantine. There was no mention of the musician contracting the virus in both instances.\n\nNoticiasrge\u2019s fake report used as its thumbnail a screengrab of Grohl from his July 2018 interview with American talk show CBS Sunday Morning. The logo of CNN was edited onto the photo.\n\nThe false claim was published the same day a rendition of Foo Fighters\u2019 song Times Like These featuring various artists, including Grohl, was released by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Radio One for the benefit of British citizens \u201csignificantly affected by the COVID-19 crisis.\u201d\n\nSocial media monitoring tool CrowdTangle detected Noticiasrge\u2019s fabricated post being shared by several Facebook accounts on May 20, potentially reaching over 1.1 million people. Three of the story\u2019s biggest traffic generators in FB are groups Guitar Effect Pedals Enthusiast and Guitar Players on Facebook and Filipino music fanpage Noisy Daisy. A netizen asked in the comments section of Noisy Daisy\u2019s post: \u201cAny strong legit big source?\u201d\n\nThe hoax on Grohl circulated in the Philippines and Brazil, according to Facebook. Noticiasrge, which has been publishing stories since January 2019, carries stories mostly about Nirvana and other posts written in Spanish.", "lang": "en"}
