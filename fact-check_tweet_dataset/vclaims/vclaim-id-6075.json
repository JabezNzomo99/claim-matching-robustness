Antonio Trillanes IV, who accused her of spreading fake news about his supposed offshore accounts, responded Sept. 12 through a Facebook video.\n\nIn general, the literal truth or falsity of a libelous statement is immaterial in libel cases.\n\nThe courts only consider the overall effect of the statement in question, or what has been described as its \u201csting,\u201d and disregards \u201csubtle or ingenious\u201d explanations provided by the person accused of libel.\n\nThe Supreme Court, in a 2009 decision, quoting a 1918 case, said:\n\nThe question in libel cases is not what writers mean, but what their words mean to an ordinary reader, noted the Supreme Court in the same ruling:\n\n\u201cThe word \u2018alleged\u2019 is no talisman to counter libel charges,\u201d explained lawyer Marlon Anthony Tonson of the Philippine Internet Freedom Alliance.\n\n\u201cThe courts will only take into consideration the context of how these words are used, and always in reference to the entire news report or published statement,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Reuters Handbook of Journalism cautions journalists against the use of the word \u201calleged\u201d before a defamatory statement, saying it does not provide immunity from libel.\n\nLibel, a crime under the Revised Penal Code, is defined as:\n\nAll four elements of libel mentioned in the law - defamation, malice, publication and identifiability of the person defamed - must be satisfied for the crime to be proven in court.\n\nPunishment ranges from a fine of P40,000 to P1.2 million, or jail time of six months to four years and two months, or both, as well as civil action.\n\nThe enactment of the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 expanded libel to include publications made online.\n\nThe provision in the cybercrime law imposing a stiffer penalty for online libel has been ruled constitutional by the Supreme Court in 2014.\n\n\n\nCruz, R.
