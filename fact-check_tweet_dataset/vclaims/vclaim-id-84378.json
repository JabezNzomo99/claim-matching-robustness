The posts have been captioned as, \u201cThis is Allah\u2019s ideal follower, who has finished off an entire family.\u201d\n\nClick here to view the archive of the post.\n\nBandhu Prakash Pal\u2019s family had been hacked to death on October 8 in Murshidabad\u2019s Jiaganj. Social media has been abuzz with claims that Pal\u2019s family had to pay the price for his alleged links to the RSS and BJP in West Bengal since then. However, the organizations have categorically ruled out any political motive to the killings.\n\nThe image, where a man in the white kurta has been circled, also has a text with it in Bengali. It translates to, \u201cKiller and his father.\u201d\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search and was directed to the same image that was used by multiple news articles to report about the accused held in the death of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) student Abrar Ahmed. The man in the blue kurta was identified as Mehdi Hasan Rasel, general secretary of BUET unit.\n\nRasel was expelled by the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) on October 7, after recommendations were made by a probe committee looking into the murder of Abrar Fahad further.\n\nExcerpts from a Bangladeshi news report, \"Abrar, 21, a student Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (Buet), was found dead on the staircase of Sher-e-Bangla Hall of the university early Monday. Some BCL leaders beat him at room-2011 of the dormitory on Sunday night suspecting his link to Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir.\" Multiple protests took place following the death of Abrar.\n\nWe then looked up Rasel\u2019s Facebook profile and were directed to the same image that was uploaded by Rasel with his father during Eid this year. The photograph had been captioned as, \u201cInspiration, Father.\u201d\n\nRasel was remanded along with nine other students last week.", "lang": "en"}
