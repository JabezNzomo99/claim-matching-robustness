In the video, Rai can be seen interacting with the audience and encouraging them to dance to the devotional hymn.\n\nThe video has been captioned as, \u201cMohd Rafi's daughter Musthafa Parvez who is Lord Krishna's devotee has a Splendid voice. Please watch this video.\u201d\n\nThe same video, shared by a page Jai Shree Krishna two years ago with a similar narrative, has over five million views.\n\nNot only Twitter and Facebook, multiple videos of the singer have been doing the rounds on YouTube, where she has been misidentified as Mohammed Rafi's daughter.\n\nBOOM took one of the key frames from the video and ran a keyword search with Lord Krishna Bhajans. We were directed to the same video, that was uploaded to YouTube in 2015.\n\nWe then looked up Geetanjali Rai and were directed to the devotional and bhajan singer by the same name.\n\nClick here to view Rai's Facebook page. Rai is also a ghazal singer and conducts workshops on meditation and spiritual growth.\n\nBOOM contacted Shahid Rafi, Mohammed Rafi's youngest son, who rubbished the claim. \"She has nothing to do with Mohammed Rafi's family. We are seven siblings - four boys and three daughters.\" He further added that none of Rafi's daughters are named Parvez Mustafa.\n\nFurthermore, BOOM was unable to trace one Mustafa Parvez , who has been identified as Mohammed Rafi's daughter on social media. We came across two videos on YouTube, where Nasreen Ahmed and Yasmin Parvez have been identified as the singer's daughters.", "lang": "en"}
