Some California forests appear to have many more trees per acre than what is considered healthy, according to an expert cited by the San Francisco Chronicle. But more than half of the state\u2019s forested land is managed by the federal government. The U.S. Forest Service says the \u201crising costs of fighting fires has led [it] to regularly raid its $600 million budget for forest management,\u201d according to the Sacramento Bee.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet suggests only votes for Democrats were counted, as he asks \u201chow come they never find any Republican votes?\u201d But guess what? They did! It\u2019s just that more votes were counted for the Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson than for Republican challenger Gov. Rick Scott. Broward tilts heavily toward Democrats, so it would be expected that Democrats would close the margin as votes in the county were tabulated. So far, Nelson has gained about 46,000 votes, compared to about 24,000 for Scott.\n\nTrump claimed, without evidence, \u201cmany ballots are missing or forged.\u201d The White House did not respond to a request for an explanation. The \u201cmissing\u201d ballots appear to be a reference to social media chatter about a box labeled \u201cprovisional ballots;\u201d it was just pens and other supplies. The \u201cforged\u201d ballots appear to be a reference to a lawsuit filed by Nelson demanding that the state count all provisional and mail-in ballots deemed to have a signature mismatch; the campaign says inexperienced workers could be rejecting legitimate ballots.\n\n\"If someone in this lawsuit or someone in this county has evidence of voter fraud or irregularities at the supervisor\u2019s office, they should report it to their local law enforcement officer,\u201d Tuter said. \u201cIf the lawyers are aware of it, they should swear out an affidavit, but everything the lawyers are saying out there in front of the elections office is being beamed all over the country. We need to be careful of what we say. Words mean things these days.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
