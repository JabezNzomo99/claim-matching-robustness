The blasts left nearly 258 people dead and more than 500 injured.\n\nBOOM found news stories published in Sri Lankan media outlets on May 29 using the same images as the viral posts. A Sri Lankan newspaper, Dailymirror published the photos with an article titled, \"NTJ Mosque in Kekirawa demolished by Muslims.'.\n\nThe article quoted the trustee of the mosque M.H.M. Akbar Khan who explained why the mosques were demolished as, \"The mosque used by the NTJ was built with the funds of an organization based in a foreign country.\"\n\nNews articles about the mosque demolition can be read here and here.\n\nNone of the media reports mention any Muslims who participated in the demolition of the mosques, converting to Hinduism.\n\nBOOM spoke to a Sri Lanka-based reporter who corroborated the events, but couldn\u2019t confirm if the Muslims who demolished the mosque embraced Hinduism.\n\nFurthermore, AFP Fact Check spoke to Kekirawa Police Officer-In-Charge Thilak Bandara Ganegoda who was quoted as saying, \u201cNo religious conversions took place. The land was previously allocated to construct a children's library and was handed over to its rightful owner.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
