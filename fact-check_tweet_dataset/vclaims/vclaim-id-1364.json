But we weren't sure whether it referred to the total value of foreign investment, the value of new investments or just the number of investment projects.\n\nWe contacted the Conservative party who told us that the Prime Minister was referring to the increase in the number of deals being made in the North, compared to the UK as a whole.\n\nIt\u2019s correct that the total number of foreign direct investment deals made in the UK increased by 11% in 2015/16, compared to the previous year. Meanwhile, the government has said the number of deals in the North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber regions increased by 24%\u2014so about double the rate.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t tell us how much each of these investment deals was worth. Some of them might have been very large investments, others small. A change in the number of investment deals might not mean that there\u2019s been an identical change in the value of money invested.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics told us that they don\u2019t publish estimates for the value of foreign direct investment particular regions. So we don\u2019t know how the value of foreign direct investment in different regions compares, or how it changes from year to year.\n\nThis factcheck was updated on 11 October 2016 after the Conservative Party responded to our enquiry.", "lang": "en"}
