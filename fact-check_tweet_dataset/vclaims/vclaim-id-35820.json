He tweeted, \u201cAdd this to the seats won:8 It comes to 44 seats 3% more voting could have changed the entire game.\u201d It may be noted that the BJP procured eight out of 70 assembly seats in the recently concluded Delhi polls and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was re-elected to form government. The tweet has now been deleted (archive).\n\nThe same message was shared by many other individuals on Twitter. One Biswajit Roy tweeted the same claim.\n\nA relevant keyword search on Twitter led us to a tweet by the official handle of Sudarshan News. The TV channel had posted similar information as Pachauri at 10:57 am on February 11. It said, \u201c\u092d\u093e\u091c\u092a\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u0906\u0936\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u0915\u093e\u0930\u0928 (Reasons of hope for BJP)\u201d. The assertion that BJP lost with a margin of 2000 votes from 36 seats originated from this tweet. However, it is important to note that the channel\u2019s claim was about the party trailing with those many numbers of votes before the final result was declared.\n\n\u201cThe Delhi assembly elections saw a close fight in at least 13 constituencies where victory margins ranged from below 7,000 votes to as low as 753,\u201d stated an article by Hindustan Times on February 12. According to the report, poll data suggests that there was a close fight on at least nine assembly seats where the margin between the winner and the runner-up was less than 5000 votes.\n\nWe then cross-checked with the data available on the official website of the Election Commission of India and confirmed the findings of the report. Only two BJP candidates \u2013 Sat Prakash Rana from Bijwasan (753) and Raj Kumar Bhatia from Adarsh Nagar (1589) \u2013 lost the elections with a margin below 2000 votes.\n\nA day after the final results of the assembly elections was declared, BJP MP Satyadev Pachauri falsely claimed that 36 BJP candidates lost with a margin of fewer than 2000 votes. Whereas, in reality, only two candidates witnessed such neck-and-neck competition.", "lang": "en"}
