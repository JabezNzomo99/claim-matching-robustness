Netizens have claimed she is the daughter of Hollywood actor Julia Roberts.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the girl in the viral music video is not the daughter of Julia Roberts, but a lookalike.\n\nTill the filing of this story, the post had been shared almost 40,000 times. The archived version can be seen here.\n\nMany social media users were convinced that the girl is indeed Julia Roberts's daughter - the curly hair and facial features were too much of a semblance. However, some pointed out that she is not the daughter of the Hollywood superstar.\n\nUsing InVID tool, we broke up the video into keyframes, and upon reverse-searching, found it on some Facebook pages where her name was mentioned as \"Arpi Alto\".\n\nTaking a clue from this, we did a keyword search and found the Instagram and YouTube accounts of Arpi Petrosyan Alto, an Armenian singer.\n\nWe found she is quite a sensation on the Internet. She had posted her first YouTube video in January this year. \"The Way You Look Tonight\" cover song sung by her has around 4 lakh views. With a sensual voice and striking resemblance to Julia Roberts, no wonder she has become so popular in such a short time.\n\nJulia Roberts's daughter Hazel Moder, on the other hand, looks much different from Arpi Petrosyan. One of the pictures which she had posted in her Instagram account on September 27, 2019, can be seen below.\n\nActress Julia Roberts has two sons and a daughter. One of her family photos has been shared in this article.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that the girl in the viral video is Armenian singer Arpi Petrosyan, a doppelganger of Hollywood actress Julia Roberts, and not her daughter.", "lang": "en"}
