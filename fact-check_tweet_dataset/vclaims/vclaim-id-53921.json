It was posted on a satirical site then was posted again on non-satirical website think.mk, which published an article on March 23 saying Putin released the tigers and lions to enforce the country's \"no gathering\" rule.\n\nApart from the photo of the lion spotted at an intersection, the think.mk article also used a photo of 3 lions lying on a road, stopping cars from passing through.\n\nThe facts: The photos used were taken in 2016 and 2019 respectively, both in South Africa.\n\nUsing reverse image search, the photo of the lion at an intersection was traced to an incident in April 2016 when a lion wandered through the streets of Johannesburg City, as reported by the New York Post.\n\nMeanwhile, the second photo of the 3 lions was traced to a stock image taken in March 2019. It was shot at Kruger National Park.\n\nOn March 14, Russia closed its borders with Poland and Norway to foreigners in a move to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. Prior to this move, it had closed its border with China and limited arrivals from Iran and South Korea.\n\nAs the coronavirus outbreak continues, health officials in the Philippines recorded a tally of 552 cases as of March 24. Globally, the number of cases rose to 341,300, affecting 174 countries. \u2013 Loreben Tuquero/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
