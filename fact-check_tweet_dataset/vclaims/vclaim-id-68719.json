You didn\u2019t vote for it the last two times, but you voted for it in the beginning,\" Abrams said on Oct. 2.\n\nAbrams later said she was referring to Evans\u2019 involvement with a bill about the Georgia Student Scholarship Organization.\n\nThe program began in 2008, three years before Evans held a seat in Georgia\u2019s General Assembly. Back then, the Student Scholarship Organization bill established a program that allows independent individuals and businesses to receive tax credits if they make donations to local private schools. The money is then used to fund scholarships that are given to qualified, low-income students to attend the private institutions.\n\nAbrams claims that Evans had voted in favor of school vouchers a few years later, when the Legislature made revisions to the program.\n\nEvans did vote for an early version of the 2011 bill, but not for the final version. According to her campaign, she only voted for the measure because it had provisions that improved the program\u2019s transparency. When the final bill hit the House floor with its final revisions, the transparency clauses were removed, so Evans voted against the bill.\n\nEvans has also maintained that she has never voted for vouchers because the Student Scholarship Organization is not a voucher program. On June 26, 2017, the Georgia Supreme Court ruled that stated that the scholarship program is not a voucher program, because it is financed by private individuals, not public revenue, a fact that Abrams had acknowledged during the debate.\n\nDespite the Supreme Court ruling, the Student Scholarship Organization\u2019s status as a voucher program is still subject to debate. Before the forum, the Evans campaign had already been defending her stance against vouchers, and on Oct. 12 the Abrams campaign shared its opinion on Facebook that the funds in the program are \"vouchers by another name.\"\n\nAbrams said Evans \"voted for (school) vouchers...in the beginning.\" Abrams said she was referring to the Student Scholarship Organization program.\n\nSome aspects of Abrams\u2019 statement are wrong. Evans wasn\u2019t in the legislature in 2008 when program was approved. In 2011, Evans voted for revisions to the program, although she voted against the final version after those revisions were dropped.\n\nOver the years, there\u2019s been a legal dispute over whether the tax credits that fund the Student Scholarship Organization make the program different from school vouchers. In June 2017 Georgia\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that the \"voucher\" label did not apply.\n\nAbrams' claim had some accurate points, but it left out important details.
