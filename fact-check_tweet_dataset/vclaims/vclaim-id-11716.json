At the time of writing this article, it has been retweeted more than 600 times.\n\nTarek Fatah later deleted his tweet, and reposted a different version of the tweet, changing the phrase \u201cPakistan flags\u201d to \u201cgreen Islamic flags\u201d.\n\nPolitics Solitics, a Facebook page has shared the same video with a message, \u201c\u0915\u093e\u0902\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u0938\u092e\u0930\u094d\u0927\u0915 \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0941 \u092d\u093e\u0907\u092f\u094b \u092e\u0941\u092c\u093e\u0930\u0915 \u0939\u094b \u0906\u092a\u0915\u0940 \u091a\u093e\u0939\u0924 \u0915\u0940 \u092e\u093e\u0902\u0917 \u0936\u0941\u0930\u0942 \u0939\u094b \u0917\u092f\u0940 \u0939\u0948 (Congratulation to our Congress supporting Hindu brothers, the demands for your wishes have begun -translated)\u201d. So far, this post has garnered close to 11,000 shares and 2 lakh views.\n\nSeveral individual users on Facebook and Twitter have shared this video with similar claims suggesting that Muslims in Rajasthan are celebrating the electoral victory of Congress by taking out a rally where slogans like \u201cPakistan Zindabad\u201d and \u201cBabri Masjid le ke rahenge\u201d were chanted.\n\nMadhuPurnima Kishwar has also shared the same video with the identical narrative. Actor Koena Mitra also quote-tweeted Madhu Kishwar\u2019s tweet.\n\nThe Quint had earlier reported that the video belongs to Uttar Pradesh and NOT Rajasthan as falsely claimed on social media. An extended YouTube video posted by Junaid Zubairi December 6, 2016 was titled, \u201c\u0938\u0902\u092d\u0932 \u092c\u093e\u092c\u0930\u0940 \u092e\u0938\u094d\u091c\u093f\u0926 \u091c\u0941\u0932\u0942\u0938 (Sambhal Babri masjid procession -translated)\u201d. The flags seen in the video are actually representative of the \u2018Indian Union Muslim League\u2019 while it being claimed that these are Pakistani flags.\n\nSpeaking to The Quint, Zubairi said that no rallies or procession were held in the city in past week and the video was almost a year old when it was posted.\n\nSeveral instances of misinformation have come to light within two days of Congress wining the election in Rajasthan. Earlier, a clipped video of Rahul Gandhi making about-turn on farm loan waiver was massively circulated on social media. Then, a video of riot in Morbi, Gujarat was shared as the clashes in Rajasthan after Congress\u2019 victory in the state and an Islamic religious flag waved in a Congress victory procession in Tiwari, Rajasthan was passed off as Pakistani flag.", "lang": "en"}
