No, that's not true: the tweet in question was published by a parody account mimicking the recently created real Twitter account of Strzok.\n\nThe quote originated from a tweet published on August 13, 2018 from an account named \"@notpeterstrzok\" (archived here) which read:\n\nAs long as it is still up, here is the tweet in question:\n\nSo it didn't come from Strzok's real Twitter account. Fox News reported he set one up but it was named @petestrzok:\n\nOn that Twitter account, Strzok only published this tweet so far:\n\nDon't get taken in by fake accounts!", "lang": "en"}
