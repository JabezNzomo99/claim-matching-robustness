Major Chinese cities and provinces are moving to cancel this term\u2019s running tests amid concerns over student fitness following three months of lockdown and school closures.\n\n\u201cPossible breathing difficulties during the exam while mask-wearing remains mandatory in the absence of a vaccine have also led to the decision, reports said. It comes after two 14-year-old boys \u2018suddenly\u2019 collapsed on their school running track and were subsequently declared dead in the county of Dancheng in Henan Province and the city of Changsha in Hunan Province \u2014 both in Central China.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Mail published a similar report on May 4.\n\nThose reports contained a high degree of accuracy, although some misrepresented the respective ages of the boys. The deaths were widely reported in China in May 2020, providing corroboration of the following core facts.\n\nOn April 24, a 15-year-old boy given the pseudonym Xiao Li died after collapsing during gym class at Caiyuan Middle School in Henan Province. (His age was incorrectly given as 14 years old in articles by the New York Post and 7News). On April 30, a 14-year-old boy at the Xiangjun Future Experimental School in Hunan Province died after collapsing during a running drill in gym class.\n\nAccording to one report, educational authorities in several Chinese provinces introduced new guidelines in late April and early May, apparently in response to the deaths, instructing schools not to force students to wear a mask while exercising (but to maintain distancing between students), as well as avoiding conducting gym class at or around noon.\n\nAlthough we found ample corroboration of the circumstances surrounding the boys\u2019 deaths, it\u2019s not clear whether their wearing face masks was a contributing factor in their deaths, or merely a coincidence.\n\nOn May 4, the state-run People\u2019s Daily reported that the family of the boy who died on April 24 had refused to agree to an autopsy, meaning a definitive conclusion could not be reached about the cause or causes of his death. According to other reports, an autopsy was not performed in relation to the death on April 30, either.\n\nThe English-language reports mentioned above rightly did not claim with any certainty that the boys\u2019 wearing face masks was what had killed them, and all three carried quotations from Cao Lanxiu, a professor at Shanxi University, in the city of Taiyuan. Cao told Chinese news media that she believed it was unlikely the wearing of the face masks was any more than coincidental in the boys\u2019 deaths.", "lang": "en"}
