Hanson, a former slave who had purchased his own freedom, arrived in Liberia in 1827, where he became a merchant and later a senator in Grand Bassa County, Liberia (here, here ).\n\nHanson\u2019s daguerreotype, part of a series of portraits of African American leaders in Liberia, was taken by Augustus Wilson, a free Black man associated with the American Colonization Society. Founded in 1816, the society, whose members included future presidents Andrew Jackson and James Monroe, advocated the creation of a colony in western Africa for the formerly enslaved. In 1847, that colony achieved independence and became the nation of Liberia ( here ). Eleven thousand African Americans emigrated to Liberia between 1820 and 1864, 7,000 of whom gained freedom from slavery by agreeing to emigrate ( here ). More information on the American Colonization Society, provided by the Virginia Center for Digital History at the University of Virginia, can be found here .\n\nThe white John Hanson, described in the Facebook posts as \u201cpresident before George Washington,\u201d was the first president of the Continental Congress under the Articles of Confederation, the agreement the U.S. government operated under before the advent of the Constitution in 1781 ( here ). A portrait of this John Hanson can be found here .\n\nRatified in 1781 during the Revolutionary War, the Articles of Confederation \u201ccreated a loose confederation of sovereign states and a weak central government, leaving most of the power with the state governments\u201d ( here ). A delegate to the Continental Congress from 1780 to 1782, Hanson served as president of the congress from 1781 to 1782 ( here ). There was no national executive under the Articles of Confederation, however, and Hanson\u2019s position had no broad executive powers ( here ).\n\nOn April 1, 2014, the Library of Congress published a post called \u201cDon\u2019t Be Fooled by Primary Sources, this misinformation may have started as an April Fool\u2019s joke ( here ).\n\nThe Library explains: \u201cWhen people search the Library\u2019s Web site, loc.gov, for an image of president John Hanson, they often find\u2014and sometimes publish \u2014 (the image of the Liberian statesman) from our daguerreotype collection.\u201d They note that \u201cthe daguerreotype process wasn\u2019t even invented until the 1830s,\u201d over half a century after the death of Continental Congress President John Hanson.\n\nOn January 21, 2009, Barack Obama was inaugurated as the 44th president of the United States, making history as the nation\u2019s first Black president ( here ).\n\nReuters previously fact-checked a similar claim where social media posts had mistakenly identified a Black Abraham Lincoln, here.\n\nFalse. The John Hanson shown in the image of the daguerreotype was a senator in Liberia. He is not the same person as the John Hanson who served as first president of the Continental Congress.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
