The Pound has fallen by 12% against the Euro and 5% against the US Dollar since just before the EU referendum in 2016.\n\nThe UK\u2019s economic growth is not quite the slowest in Europe. The UK\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) has grown by 1.5%, comparing July-September 2017 to the same period the year before. That\u2019s slower than every EU country except Denmark and Greece (although there\u2019s no data yet for Ireland and Luxembourg), and the average rate among EU members is 2.6%.\n\nThe UK\u2019s growth was roughly the joint lowest in Europe earlier last year, comparing economies\u2019 growth up to June 2017.\n\nHow much the Pound has fallen by depends on which currency you\u2019re comparing it to. The pound has fallen 12% against the Euro compared to what it was just before the EU referendum and about 5% against the US Dollar, based on monthly averages.\n\nBut, the IMF had said back in February 2016 that the pound was \u201cmoderately overvalued in 2015\u201d by 5 to 15 percent. Other groups including the Bank of England and the IMF agreed that the pound was overvalued. This means the exchange rate could have been artificially high before the EU referendum .\n\nA fall in the pound makes things bought from abroad more expensive and makes it cheaper for people abroad to buy things from the UK, whether that\u2019s UK companies, UK footballers, or UK exports.", "lang": "en"}
