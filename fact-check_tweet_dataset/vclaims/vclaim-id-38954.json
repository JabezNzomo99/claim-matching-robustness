Its headline says: \"FORMER PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER HAS ENDORSED BERNIE SANDERS.\"\n\nCarter supported Sanders\u2019 bid in 2016, but he did not formally endorse him during his run then and has not endorsed any candidate so far in the 2020 presidential primary.\n\nThe blog post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe post, published by a blog called \"Liberty Inquiries\" on March 7, 2020, is almost entirely taken from a 2017 story about Carter\u2019s previous support for Sanders.\n\nThat story, published by website Talking Points Memo, reported on Carter\u2019s disclosure that he voted for Sanders during the 2016 Democratic primary.\n\nIn May 2017, Sanders joined Carter for a discussion at the Carter Center in Georgia. At one point during the event, Carter says: \"Can y\u2019all see why I voted for him?\"\n\nBut the recent blog post being shared on Facebook falsely plants Carter\u2019s comment as a 2020 endorsement for Sanders, changing a line from the 2017 article, which originally said: \"Carter previously stayed mostly mum about the 2016 election\" to \"Carter previously stayed mostly mum about the 2020 election.\"\n\nYears ago Carter said he voted for Sanders in the 2016 primary. He has not endorsed him, or anyone else yet, in 2020.", "lang": "en"}
