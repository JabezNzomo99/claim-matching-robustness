In the video, a man can be heard calling the territory \u201cmini Pakistan\u201d. Twitter handle @noconversion posted the video with the message, \u201cPakistani flags \u2026 in Jalandhar Punjab, this area Vijay Colony is infested with Christian Missionaries\u201d. It has garnered more than 900 retweets so far.\n\nA few more people on Facebook shared the video with a similar narrative. A post by a Facebook user Karishma has amassed close to 1,300 shares at the time of writing this article.\n\nWith the help of a keyword search on Google, we found a news report published by Dainik Bhaskaron November 4, 2019. This was also pointed out by a Twitter user. On November 4, the police reached Jalandhar\u2019s Vijay Colony along with a local Shiv Sena leader who informed that the Muslim community was allegedly raising Pakistani flags. According to the report, the flags were removed by the residents, however, a protest was later staged. The Muslim community argued that the flags were \u201cIslamic religious flags\u201d, not Pakistani flags. After the outrage, the police realised their misunderstanding and the flags were reinstated under the police\u2019s direction.\n\nIn the comparison below, one can observe a clear distinction between the two flags. The Pakistani national flag (right) has a vertical white stripe on the left with a crescent moon and a star on a green background. On the other hand, the flags that were used in Jalandhar (left) had two stripes, one with white spots on a blue background and other with black zig-zag lines on a white coloured stripe. These were hoisted in the locality to mark the celebration of Prophet Hazrat Muhammed\u2019s birth anniversary on November 10.\n\nA video of Islamic flags hoisted in Punjab\u2019s Jalandhar was shared with the false narrative that Pakistani flags were raised in the locality. The police mistook them for Pakistani flags and took them down, however, the flags were later restored.\n\n[This article was updated on November 8 to include the tweet by Pakistani user @MirMAKOfficial.]", "lang": "en"}
