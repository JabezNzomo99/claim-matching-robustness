Einat Kalish-Rotem's official Facebook page showed that the work was in any case to be returned to Finland by the end of the month.\n\n\"The remaining items will be hung in a closed room,\" she wrote.\n\nAsked if McDonald\u2019s knew or approved of the sculpture, Jani Leinonen told AFP he did not ask for permission for his artworks.\n\n\u201cI have no idea if McDonald\u2019s knew about the work. Legally it is not an artist\u2019s job to notify or ask permission from companies we might criticise or parody.
