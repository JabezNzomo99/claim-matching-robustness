The pornographic DVDs on the shelves behind Barnes were photoshopped into this image. In the original footage, various books, such as \u201cSober\u201d by Tony Adams, and \u201cGhost on the Wall\u201d by Derek Dohren, can be seen on the shelf behind him.\n\nHere\u2019s a comparison of the fake image (left), and a still shot from the original footage (right):\n\nBarnes\u2019 interview on Sky News, in which he defended comedian Leigh Francis\u2019 use of blackface, can be viewed here.\n\nWhile this image of pornographic DVDs behind Barnes is obviously fake, the fake photo seems to have been inspired by another embarrassing incident involving him.\n\nA few days before the Barnes image started circulating online, he shared a meme on social media featuring an image of U.S. President Donald Trump that included a fictitious quote from Trump\u2019s mother, in which she calls her son an idiot (you can read about the fake quote here). Barnes also inadvertently included a few stills from his camera roll that featured pornographic images.\n\nBarnes has since apologized for sharing the NSFW images:", "lang": "en"}
