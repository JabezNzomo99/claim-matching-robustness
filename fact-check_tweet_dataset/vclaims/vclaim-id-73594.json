The decision though has run into stiff opposition from right-wing organisations and festival committees.\n\nAmidst this, a video of a group of men from Hyderabad squabbling next to a Ganesha idol went viral on the internet. The video claims that it showed how Hindus were prevented from installing a Ganesh idol by anti-Hindu goons.\n\nThe caption to one such 1:10 minutes-long video uploaded on Twitter reads, \u201cThis is happening in Hyderabad & not Pakistan Some local goons were opposing to the installation of Shri Ganesha\u2019s statue & damaged it too, then some brothers had to bash them KCR thinks that he\u2019s the next Nizam is teaming up with Razakars #AntiHinduKCR\u201d\n\nNetizens believe that the instance shown in the video is that of a communal clash, between Hindu and Muslim communities in Hyderabad, over the installation of the Ganesha idol. Three Police officers are also present in the video trying to pull away the men fighting each other.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claim is misleading. The fight took place between two Hindu groups and has nothing to do with the Muslim community or any kind of an \u2018anti-Hindu\u2019 group.\n\nThe video was also shared on Facebook with similar claims.\n\nThe archived version of the posts can be found here, here and here.\n\nWith the help of the InVid tool and appropriate keywords, we found the video in question shared by a Twitter user with a Telugu caption. According to this tweet, the incident happened in the Balagunj area of Lal Darwaza in Hyderabad\u2019s Moghalpura.\n\nWhen contacted, A. Ravi Kumar, the Station Head Officer (SHO) of Moghalpura station said that the incident took place between two Hindu groups and there is no communal angle to it.\n\n\u201cSince the last 20 years, the local people have been installing a Lord Ganesha statue on a government property in Balagunj area where the said fight happened on August 22. Over the years, there was a permanent pandal constructed for Lord Ganesha on that land. However, two years ago, a Hindu man bought the land near the pandal. He filed a complaint to the local authorities that the celebrations in that pandal are violating his family's privacy. Following which, a few months ago the local body removed the pandal,\u201d the SHO said.\n\n\u201cThis time the festival committee along with a few right-wing groups came to install the Ganesha statue as usual and the man and his family objected. That is how the entire dispute erupted,\u201d he added.\n\nAFWA also spoke to Balagunj temple committee member Jittu who rubbished the claim of communal angle in the matter. He also said the idol was already broken by the time they brought it to the area.\n\n\u201cThe fight was just between a local Ganesh Chaturthi festival committee and a Hindu family. Also, unlike claimed in the viral posts, the idol was not destroyed during the fight. It was already broken while transporting it to Balagunj.\u201d\n\nAFWA also reached out to MA Rasheed, ACP, Faluknuma Division, who confirmed to us that there are no reports of communal tension in the Lal Darwaza area on the event of Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations.\n\nHence the claim that the video purportedly shows Hindus being prevented from installing a Ganesha idol by anti-Hindu goons is misleading. The fight was between members of the same faith.", "lang": "en"}
