Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral post is fake.\n\nA post doing rounds on social media shared by a page named Science Facts reads: \u201cChina seek for court\u2019s approval to kill the over 20,000 coronavirus patients to avoid further spread of the virus.\u201d The archived version of the post can be checked here.\n\nWhen Vishvas News investigated we found that the content of the viral post has been taken from a website named City News.\n\nWhen we read the entire content, we found that the report was full of errors (spelling and grammatical).\n\nWe further investigated and found that the website has been publishing junk news stories earlier as well.\n\nThis website has also previously spread fake news about the coronavirus. The government of Singapore released a statement refuting the claim.\n\nWe searched the claim on the website of \u201cThe Supreme People\u2019s Court Of The People\u2019s Republic Of China\u201d. there was no mention of the case in this website.\n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) has been publishing Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Situation Reports.\n\nThese reports give statistics on the situation of the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and other countries.\n\nIf China was seeking the court\u2019s approval to kill 20,000 people to stop further spread of the virus, the World Health Organization (WHO) would have reported it. There is no mention such a report on the website of World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nVishvas News Spoke to Shamim Zakira, Foreign Editor, Global Times, Beijing, China. He said: \u201cThis news is circulating online. and it is a hoax and an absolute case of fake news. Though the situation is grim, yet, life is slowing striding to normality. I must say, the government is accelerating all efforts to contain the spread. People should not spread such fake news.\u201d\n\nVishvas News has earlier debunked fake and misleading posts related to coronavirus.
