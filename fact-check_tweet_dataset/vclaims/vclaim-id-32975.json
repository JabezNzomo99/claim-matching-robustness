It\u2019s not accurate to claim that this was polling \u201cfor\u201d the constituency. Using polling data in this way is an issue we\u2019ve written about before.\n\nThe figures are based on a poll by Survation from 11 August.\n\nAround 2,000 UK adults were asked how they would vote in an election if it were held the following day.\n\nBased on these results Survation estimated that, if an election was held tomorrow, the Conservatives would receive 28% of the votes and the Liberal Democrats would receive 21% of the votes (these figures exclude those who said they didn\u2019t know who they\u2019d vote for or refused to answer).\n\nThese results are for the whole of the UK: the Survation poll didn\u2019t ask any questions about specific parliamentary constituencies.\n\nTo get that information Ms Harding used Flavible, a polling website not affiliated to Survation, to take the survey\u2019s national results and localise them to project the voting intention for each UK parliamentary constituency in England, Scotland and Wales.\n\nWe\u2019ve written before about local Liberal Democrat branches using Flavible projections to claim that opinion polls say they are ahead of other parties in various constituencies.\n\nThe website predicts that in the event of an election and based on the national results from the Survation poll, the Liberal Democrats would poll 37.85% in Esher and Walton ahead of the 36.62% of the Conservatives.\n\nThat\u2019s quite a change from the actual results of the 2017 election in the constituency which saw Dominic Raab elected with 59% of the vote, Labour come second with 20% and the Liberal Democrats third with 17%.\n\nAs we\u2019ve said before, the main problem is that you can\u2019t reliably convert national polling results into local areas like this.\n\nFlavible\u2019s stated methodology is a \u2018weighted swing\u2019, whereby changes in support for the parties at the national level are applied to each constituency, with the numbers weighted by things like which way the seat voted in the Brexit referendum and whether it changed hands in either of the last two elections.\n\nBut regardless of the accuracy of Flavible\u2019s model, Ms Harding\u2019s tweet suggests that polling was done at a constituency level within Esher and Walton, which wasn\u2019t the case.", "lang": "en"}
