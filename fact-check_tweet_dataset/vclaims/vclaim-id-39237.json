Let\u2019s check the veracity of the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Video of AAP\u2019s Sanjay Singh beating his co-MLA with shoes during their party\u2019s meeting. Fact: The men exchanging blows in the video belong to Uttar Pradesh unit of BJP. During a meeting in UP, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Sharad Tripathi and BJP Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Rakesh Singh exchanged blows after an argument broke out between them. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched on Google with keywords, the same video was found on the YouTube channel of \u2018ANI\u2019. As per this video, on 6 March 2019, Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Sant Kabir Nagar BJP MP Sharad Tripathi and BJP MLA Rakesh Singh have exchanged blows following an argument over placement of names on a foundation stone of a project. So, the men involved in the scuffle in the video are the party leaders of the Uttar Pradesh BJP unit. More information regarding the incident can be found here and here.\n\nTo conclude, the men exchanging blows in the video belong to BJP, not AAP. Also, the incident took place in Uttar Pradesh. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
