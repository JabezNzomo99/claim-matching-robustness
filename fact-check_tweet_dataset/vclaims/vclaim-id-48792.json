Please consider donating to PolitiFact today.\n\nThe World Health Organization says it\u2019s not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses:\n\n\"Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).\"\n\nNew CDC research conducted on the Diamond Princess cruise ship found traces of the coronavirus on some of the ship\u2019s surfaces up to 17 days after passengers disembarked. But traces are not the same thing as live viruses.\n\nThe report doesn\u2019t conclude that the virus \"survived\" on any of the surfaces that long and the CDC hasn\u2019t issued an official statement that gives that assessment, either.\n\nDr. Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of immunobiology and molecular, cellular and developmental biology at Yale University, also told us it was the presence of the virus that was found, not a live sample.\n\n\"The CDC report examined the presence of viral RNA on various surfaces of the cruise ship. They found viral RNA up to 17 days after cabins were vacated on the Diamond Princess,\" Iwasaki wrote in an email. \"A piece of viral RNA is not the same thing as a live infectious virus. In order for a virus to be infectious, it has to have intact membrane, spike protein and the whole intact genome (there are close to 30,000 bases of genetic code in the viral genome).\"\n\nWe previously looked at how long the virus can survive on certain surfaces in a recent fact-check and found research suggesting it can live for up to three hours in the air, four hours on copper, 24 hours on cardboard and three days on plastic and stainless steel. It\u2019s important to note that the study hasn\u2019t been peer-reviewed and more research is needed.\n\nThe WHO and other health experts recommend that people disinfect surfaces often and wash their hands to avoid contracting or spreading the virus.\n\nMore research needs to be done, but there is no evidence that the coronavirus can surive for up to 17 days on various surfaces. We rate this False.", "lang": "en"}
