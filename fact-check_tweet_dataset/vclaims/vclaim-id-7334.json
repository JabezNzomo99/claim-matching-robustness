The report has since been revised. \n\n \n\n\n\nCrowds of women took to the streets of South Africa in early August to\n\nagainst the violence suffered by women, children and gender non-conforming people in the country.\n\nprotests and what could be done to stop gender-based violence across the world.\n\nDuring the programme, text was\n\n: \u201cThe UN estimates [a] 117% rise in killing of women in South Africa since 2015.\u201d A reader emailed Africa Check asking us to verify the figure.\n\nWe looked at the latest data to get a picture of the risk South African women face.\n\nThe 117% figure came from a number of sources, Mohammed Elaichi, a programme editor at Al Jazeera, told Africa Check.\n\nThese included articles from the\n\n(Stats SA) as the source of the figure - not the\n\nin South Africa on 19 June 2018. It lists a number of\n\nof \u201cfemicide\u201d, which here we simply define as \u201cthe murder of women\u201d.\n\nThe report included a table showing that the femicide rate had dropped every year from 2000 to 2015. But it also showed, worryingly, a dramatic increase from 9.6 murders per 100,000 women in 2015 to 20.8 in 2016/17.\n\nThis was a 117% increase. The figure was widely reported in South African media, but later withdrawn by the statistical agency.\n\nStats SA removed the femicide estimate from the report the week after it was published, Raphael Kasonga, a director at the statistical agency, told Africa Check.\n\nThe dramatic increase shown in the report was the result of comparing two different data sets: the\n\nThe WHO estimated that 9.6 out of every 100,000 women in South Africa were murdered in 2015. The victims of crime survey estimate was 20.8 per 100,000 in 2016/17.\n\nBut Stephanie Burrows, a technical officer in the WHO\u2019s\n\nprogramme, told Africa Check that \u201cit is not correct to compare WHO estimates with other figures as the methodology differs completely\u201d.\n\n\n\n \n\n Crime victims survey is useful, but has limitations \n\n is useful as a complement to police crime data, according to Lizette Lancaster, the \n\n\n\n It does have it\u2019s limitations, however. \n\n\n\n First, it wasn\u2019t the \u201cbest vehicle for measuring interpersonal violence such as violence against women\u201d, Lancaster said. This is because the crimes of femicide and domestic violence take place in the very household being surveyed. \n\n\n\n Second, as statistician-general Risenga Maluleke explained in the , while the survey sample was \u201creasonably large\u201d, the number of households that experience these crimes was \u201coften very small\u201d. This could lead to high levels of error. \n\n\n\n Third, people understand definitions and concepts differently. Violence and assault may not be understood as crimes and so might not be reported to Stats SA in the victims of crime survey. \n\n\n\n \u201cThe concept of murder is also controversial as some may not regard a killing as murder while others may believe that a legally defined murder was indeed an accident,\u201d said Lancaster. \n\n\n\nSo what do we know about the risk of murder faced by women in South Africa?\n\nThe WHO\u2019s Burrows provided the organisation\u2019s most recent femicide numbers.\n\nTo calculate their estimates WHO uses information from\n\n. They consider crimes recorded by the police as well as vital registration information, data from the WHO\u2019s\n\nTheir estimates show a murder rate of 12.2 per 100,000 females in 2015 and 12.1 per 100,000 in 2016. This works out to a 0.8% decrease.\n\nHowever, Burrows told Africa Check that she would not advise reporting on the percentage drop between the two years because the decrease was so small.\n\nShe added that the estimates were modelled and had wide confidence intervals (marked in square brackets in the table above). A confidence interval is the range of values in which a measure of population is likely to be found.\n\nIn the WHO\u2019s femicide estimates, the confidence intervals for 2015 and 2016 overlap. This means further analysis is needed to find out if the change between the two years is\n\n(SAPS) and Stats SA also disproves that there has been a 117% increase in femicide.\n\nSAPS provides data on the number of women, 18 years and older, reported murdered in each financial year. Africa Check used this data and Stats SA population estimates for women in this group to calculate the femicide rate. (\n\nThe data shows that the femicide rate increased from 13 murders per 100,000 women in 2015/16 to 14 murders per 100,000 women in 2016/17. This is an increase of 7.7%.\n\nConclusion: Femicide rise of 117% comes from incorrect comparison of figures, now withdrawn, in Stats SA report\n\nMedia reports and government statements claimed South Africa had experienced a 117% spike in femicide \u2013 the murder of women \u2013 between 2015 and 2016/17.\n\nThis figure was based on estimates of the female murder rate provided by Stats SA for 2016/17. These estimates were incorrectly compared to World Health Organisation data from 2015.\n\nThe two sets of data were each the result of different research methods, and so could not be compared. Stats SA has since revised its report to exclude the estimates.\n\nThe most recent South African police data shows a 7.7% increase in the femicide rate between 2015/16 and 2016/17.\n\nBased on this information, we rate the claim as incorrect.", "lang": "en"}
