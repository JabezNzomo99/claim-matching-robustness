It is to be mentioned that after his address at Motera stadium in Ahmedabad, Trump made a visit to the Taj Mahal in Agra.\n\nThe viral video shows a fire engine spraying water on the monument. It is being claimed that the Taj Mahal was washed ahead of Trump\u2019s visit.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the monument in the viral video is not the Taj Mahal of Agra. In fact, it is a replica of the Taj Mahal built in an amusement park named People\u2019s Mall in Bhopal.\n\nThe 45-second video was put up by a Facebook page called Meena Music with a caption in Hindi that translates to, When Taj Mahal was bathed for Trump: Taj and Bapu are alike, they are criticised by Modi but also cared for due to his selfish gains. The archived version of the post can be seen here .\n\nTo verify the claim, we watched the video carefully and found that the floorings of the original Taj Mahal of Agra and the one in the viral video are different.\n\nWe ran an Internet search with the keywords Taj Mahal replica and found some videos of the same in an amusement park named People\u2019s Mall in Bhopal. We found that the flooring and dolphin fountains in this monument look similar to the ones in the viral video .\n\nThis amusement park has replicas of all the Seven Wonders of the World. However, it is not clear when the viral video was shot.\n\nAhead of Trump\u2019s visit to Agra, the Archeological Survey of India (ASI) had undertaken cleaning up of the monument using mud packs to remove dark spots. The graves of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal were also given mud pack treatment.\n\nMany prominent media houses had reported about this makeover. Hence, it is clear the viral video is from Bhopal where the replica of the Taj Mahal was washed.\n\n\n\nAlso Read | Fact Check: Before Trump\u2019s visit, slum image from Mumbai passed off as Gujarat on social media\n\nAlso Read | Fact Check: This is not the bike accident video of Tamil actor Ajith Kumar", "lang": "en"}
