This portion of the credits simply lists various crew members who worked on the film. Many of the names that appear in the above-displayed image can also be found on IMDB\u2019s list of crew members, where they are presented without any mention of someone\u2019s passing.\n\nThe movie \u201cCats\u201d received poor reviews after its release and was widely mocked on social media. It appears that this claim was first posted as a joke by an activist as she live-tweeted her experience while watching \u201cCats.\u201d\n\nIn short, the claim that dozens of people died while making \u201cCats\u201d was simply a joke made up out of whole cloth.", "lang": "en"}
