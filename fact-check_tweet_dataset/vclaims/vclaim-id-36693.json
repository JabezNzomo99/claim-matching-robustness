Qasem Soleimani \u201cbecause Adam Schiff \u2018spent the last year on impeachment.'\u201d\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s statement suggested that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff\u2019s critical tweet was the result of \u201cSchiff\u2019s focus on impeachment instead of intelligence,\u201d per a spokesman from McCarthy\u2019s office. It did not suggest a causal link between Trump ordering the drone strike and Schiff holding impeachment hearings.\n\nDuring a Jan. 7 appearance on \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d McCarthy discussed the latest developments in impeachment and the U.S.\u2019s killing of Soleimani, the head of Iran\u2019s elite Quds Force. He also responded to Schiff\u2019s tweet criticizing Trump for ordering the drone strike that killed Soleimani.\n\n\u201cYou know what? He\u2019s the chairman of the Intel committee,\u201d said McCarthy. \u201cMaybe had he spent the last year working on that, trying to protect us from what was happening in Iran \u2013 from the bombing of the tankers, Saudi Arabia, taking down our drone \u2013 instead of taking that committee and making it impeachment, he would never have made that comment.\u201d\n\nSchiff tweeted his criticism of Trump\u2019s move Jan. 6, just a day before Iran launched retaliatory missile attacks on two military bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq. Other politicians, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Republican Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, have also criticized Trump for the drone strike.\n\n\u201cA dangerous and provocative decision to target a top Iranian official for killing. Threats to bomb cultural sites and use disproportionate force,\u201d wrote Schiff. \u201cThese are the acts of a President with no functional national security process. Congress must engage with hearings and constraints.\u201d\n\nRaw Story published an article Jan. 7 with the headline that reads, \u201cKevin McCarthy claims Trump killed Iranian general because Adam Schiff \u2018spent the last year on impeachment.'\u201d The story claims that Trump wouldn\u2019t have ordered the drone strike that killed Soleimani if Schiff had not pursued impeachment.\n\nBut, according to a spokesman from McCarthy\u2019s office, the article mischaracterizes the House minority leader\u2019s statement.\n\n\u201cHouse Democrats are more worried about removing President Trump from office than they are about removing terrorists from the face of the earth,\u201d said Mark Bednar, McCarthy\u2019s communications director, in an email to the Caller. \u201cLeader McCarthy told Fox & Friends that had Chairman Schiff actually used his committee for intelligence instead of impeachment, he wouldn\u2019t have issued that negative comment about President Trump\u2019s decisive action against Soleimani.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s statement did not draw a causal link between Trump ordering the drone strike and Schiff holding impeachment hearings. Bednar appears to suggest McCarthy implied Schiff was unaware of the threat Soleimani posed because he focused on impeachment rather than intelligence in his capacity as the chair of the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nThe House minority leader emphasized later in the \u201cFox and Friends\u201d interview that Trump ordered the drone strike because Soleimani posed a threat to the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe one thing I have a clear understanding, this man has killed more than 600 Americans. This man had continued to rise throughout the region, create problems not only for us but the rest of the world,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThe world is safer today because this president took action, and he stopped something from creating in the future.\u201d\n\nSoleimani was \u201cactively developing plans\u201d to attack U.S. diplomats and service members in the region, according to a statement from the Pentagon.", "lang": "en"}
