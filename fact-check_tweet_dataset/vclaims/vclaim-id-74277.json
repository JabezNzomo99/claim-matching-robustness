The Council DOES NOT UPGRADE RESULTS. These are the activities of fraudsters and the Council has on several occasions put out adverts/notifications alerting the public about their activities\u201d, Agnes Teye- Cudjoe stated.\n\nSimilarly, Dubawa contacted the WAEC Accra office and they notified that the only official WAEC Ghana Facebook page is @waecghanainfo.\n\nThe claim that WAEC and GES have provided a system for WAEC students to upgrade their results is false. The Head of Public Affairs for WAEC Accra, Agnes Teye-Cudjoe, has debunked such claims, stating that any Facebook page or online website purporting to be a WAEC consultant helping WAEC students upgrade results is fraudulent.", "lang": "en"}
