I\u2019m thankful this is happening. Hopefully Kroger, Publix and Target will follow suit. I\u2019ve been risking my life along with my family\u2019s life to service these stores with excessive amounts of people and their all time attitudes. Yesterday was the worst.\"\n\nThe alleged Walmart announcement, which contains multiple grammatical errors, reads:\n\n\"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic effective immediately Walmart is adopting a staggered shopping schedule as follows. We apologize for the (sic) inconeince: Monday Age 66+, Tuesday 56-65, Wednesday 46-55, Thursday 36-45, Friday 25-35, Saturday 24 and below, Sunday Emergency shopping only.\"\n\nHR 1 will allow members of Congress to draw a second salary \u201cworth an estimated $600,000 per year!\u201d There has been no Walmart or Sam\u2019s Club policy change that involves a shopping schedule separated by age group. \"The staggered shopping schedule is completely false,\" Rebecca Thomason, a Walmart corporate communications senior manager, told PolitiFact. \"We do have senior shopping hours and recently announced pick up hours for at-risk customers.\" Other grocery stores have also announced senior citizen shopping hours during the pandemic. Walmart\u2019s takes place every Tuesday, an hour before the store opens. The pickup hour Walmart recently announced will run at select locations from 7 to 8 a.m. and will be reserved for \"customers over the age of 60, as well as first responders, customers with disabilities and anyone designated high-risk by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\" according to the organization\u2019s website. The company has implemented new policies for seniors and at-risk populations amid COVID-19, but it hasn\u2019t mandated that certain age groups have to shop on specific days.", "lang": "en"}
