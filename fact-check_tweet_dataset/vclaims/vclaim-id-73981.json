The caption appears to suggest that the people pictured have put their health at risk by attending the annual motorcycle rally during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHowever, a reverse image search revealed the picture actually comes from the 2015 Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. The photo was posted on the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally Facebook page twice in 2015, with the caption for one instance stating that the \u201cofficial estimate for attendees in 2015 was 739,000!\u201d\n\nChristina Steele, public information officer for the city of Sturgis, confirmed to Check Your Fact in an email that the photo was taken in 2015, noting, \u201cThe photo was taken from an elevated photo tower and those are not in place this year.\u201d (RELATED: Does This Photo Show People In Berlin Protesting Against Coronavirus Restrictions?)\n\nThe 2020 Sturgis Motorcycle Rally started on Aug. 7 and runs through Aug. 16, according to the event\u2019s website.

Kristi Noem said, \u201cWe know we can have these events, give people information, let them protect their health but still enjoy their way of life and enjoy events like the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
