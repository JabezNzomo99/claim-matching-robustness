FAUCI, MELINDA GATES AND BARACK OBAMA AT THE WUHAN LAB IN 2015\u2026!!!! You mean this Dr Fauci who was with Obama in 2015 in the WuHan lab where they paid the lab 3.7 million for a 'bat' project?\" reads the caption of one such post.\n\nIn the photograph, Obama can be seen conversing with a woman in a white lab coat in a laboratory setting, while Fauci stands in the background with another woman. Dr Anthony Fauci is the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and a member of the White House coronavirus task force. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has donated funds to GAVI Foundation, an organisation on the forefront of making vaccine available to countries who can't afford it.\n\nAccording to the article, former President Barack Obama had visited the campus of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, MD to witness the biomedical research that was being conducted against Ebola virus disease. The President had toured the NIH Vaccine Research Center and met with scientists who were working with the deadly virus.\n\n\n\nTherefore, the lab is not situated in Wuhan, China contrary to viral claims. More photos from the visit were found in the AFP register. The photos were taken by AFP photographer Mandel Ngan.\n\nThe caption of the blog post clearly states that the photo shows HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell along with Dr Anthony Fauci. Below is a comparison of photographs of HHS Secretary Sylvia (right) and Melinda Gates (left):\n\nWhat Is The Bat Project? The Trump administration terminated funding for a years-long research project in China, that many experts say is vital to preventing the next major coronavirus outbreak, in April 2020. Reportedly, the project was run by a U.S. non-profit called EcoHealth Alliance. As part of the project, teams were sent to China to trap bats, collect samples of their blood, saliva and faeces, and then check those samples for new coronaviruses that could spark the next global pandemic. The objective was to identify locations that need to be monitored, come up with strategies to prevent spillover of the virus into human populations and get a jump on creating vaccines and treatments. The viral posts also claimed that \"they paid the lab 3.7 million for a 'bat' project,\". The NIH grant was actually $3.4 million which was, awarded to EcoHealth Alliance.\n\nFurther, EcoHealth did work with the Wuhan Institute of Virology, but the lab received only $600,000 of the grant over the years, Kessler had said in May.
