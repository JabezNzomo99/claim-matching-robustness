She tweeted, \"Let's take a moment to remember the hero of 26/11! He took over 40 rounds from the AK47 of Ajmal Kasab, but captured him alive. We salute you, Sri Tukaram Omble Ji! \"\n\nTukaram Omble, an assistant sub-inspector of Mumbai Police, was instrumental in apprehending Ajmal Kasab, the only terrorist caught alive in the Mumbai terror attacks of 2008. Omble had received 40 bullets from Kasab at point blank range, till his team overpowered the latter and caught him alive. Omble did not survive the attack.\n\nThe same screen grab was tweeted by actor Amitabh Bachchan, along with an image showing police officers paying tribute to Omble.\n\nNetizens have also been sharing the same screen grab on Facebook featuring Sunil Jadhav to pay tribute to Omble on his death anniversary.\n\nThe 2008 Mumbai terror attacks were a series of blasts carried out by terrorists owing allegiance to the international terror outfit Lashkar-e-taiba.\n\nBOOM could ascertain that the image is not from the actual crime scene. We ran a reverse image search and were directed to the a scene from The Attacks of 26/11 (2013) where Jadhav can be seen taking bullet shots moments after he apprehends Kasab in the car they had hijacked.\n\nThe image of Omble photographed in his uniform is an Indian Express photo. The same can be seen here.\n\nAn excerpt from the tribute written by Indian Express reads, \"As news filtered in on his walkie-talkie that two terrorists had hijacked a Skoda near Vidhan Bhavan and were headed towards Marine Drive, he spotted the car speed past him. Omble swerved in front of the car causing it to veer and hit a divider. In the decisive moments that followed Omble ran towards Kasab, grabbed his AK-47 rifle and tried to pull him out of the vehicle. A volley of five bullets hit Omble as Kasab pressed down on the trigger. Omble still did not let go of the rifle, enabling other policemen to overpower Kasab whose partner had already been shot dead by then.\"", "lang": "en"}
