No, that's not true, the story was made up by a website that invents fake stories about bizarre crimes and sex acts for entertainment purposes. It did not happen for real.\n\nThe cannibal story originated from an article published on May 11, 2018 by World News Daily Report and was titled \"Zambian man arrested after boasting he lost 280 pounds on 'cannibal diet'\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nKabwe | A Zambian man has been arrested by authorities after boasting on social media that he had lost 280 pounds by eating a \"human meat-only\" diet.\n\nMwamba Tembo, 43, claims he was overweight until his witch doctor advised him to go on a three-month human bone broth regime. Tembo shared on social media his progressive weight loss, never divulging that he indulged in human bone broth until the end of his 3-month-long regime. Tembo allegedly told the police he did not murder anyone but bought human bones for cheap from local gravediggers who took them from \"fresh corpses only.\"\n\nHowever the photos of the man pictured appeared on a Nigerian website in 2017 in a story about a former sumo wrestler who showed off his weight loss and it didn't mention Zambia or cannibalism:\n\nFormer Obese Man 'Baba Mutu' Shares Photos To Show His Incredible Weight Loss. | National Helm This is incredible. A man identified as Emeka Okeke, popularly known as Baba Mutu, has shared pictures to show his astonishing weight loss. The former obese man who is based in Enugu state - is said to have been involved in Sumo wrestling many years ago before he decided to reduce and shed weight in order to improve his health.\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories.
