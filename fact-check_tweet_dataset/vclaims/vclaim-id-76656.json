The posts were flagged as being potentially fabricated by Facebook, as part of its efforts to crack down on made-up Internet posts masquerading as true information.\n\nThis one, keyed off Streep\u2019s acceptance speech for the Cecil B. DeMille Award for outstanding achievement at the Golden Globes on Jan. 8, is as fictional as any Hollywood creation.\n\nStreep did excoriate then-President-elect Trump\u2019s policies and past actions in her speech, without ever mentioning his name. She said she was stunned when Trump imitated a disabled reporter, a claim Trump has falsely denied.\n\nTrump took to Twitter the next day to lambast Streep for criticizing him, calling her \"over-rated\" and a \"Hillary flunky,\" again denying he mocked a reporter.\n\nThe fake blog posts claim Streep\u2019s speech was enough for Ron Howard to kick her off a reboot of the TV show Happy Days. That\u2019s odd on its own, because Howard took to Twitter himself to chide Trump and defend Streep\u2019s freedom of speech.\n\nThe article is pretty light on most details, such as whether this was to be a TV series or a film, but Streep was allegedly going to play Mrs. Cunningham. Plenty of passages in the fake story \u2014 such as saying Streep \"hasn\u2019t worked a day since that movie about shoes with the cute girl with huge eyes\" \u2014 hint that this is an attempt at humor.\n\nThe story appears to have first appeared on a Jan. 9 post on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a website that describes itself as being opposed to President Barack Obama and \"whiny politically correct liberal masses.\" We therefore don\u2019t suspect they were fans of Florence Foster Jenkins.\n\nThe \"About Us\" portion of their site reads, \"All articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.\" But this disclaimer isn\u2019t obvious on the story itself, and certainly isn\u2019t apparent reading other websites to which the post was shared.\n\nFor fans of the Fonz, we must also note that the suggestion of a Happy Days reboot (with or without Streep) also appears fake. There has been no verified report of any kind of reboot of Happy Days. RadioTimes.com wrote last year that series creator Garry Marshall said the show may one day be revived by Paramount, but there\u2019s little to suggest that\u2019s been greenlit.\n\nThe only other mention of a new Happy Days series was a story that said Netflix was creating one, but that post, too, came from a fake news website trying to be funny.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
