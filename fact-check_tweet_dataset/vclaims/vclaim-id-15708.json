Sri Lanka said Islamist group National Thowheed Jamath carried out the attacks. Earlier this week terror group Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks.\n\nThe misleading message along with the video is viral on WhatsApp and social media.\n\nThe viral message reads, \"A Buddhist dressed as a Muslim woman was caught by the Sri Lankan Police. He os one of the rouges who bombed the Sri Lankan Church.\"\n\nIn the video, Sri Lankan police personnel surround a man as he removes a burkha. The man is also seen wearing a white bra underneath.\n\nBOOM had received this message on its WhatsApp helpline number (7700906111) and did a Facebook search and found that it was viral.\n\nA Facebook page named 'Hyderabadi Siasat' also shared the same clip with the caption, \"A Buddhist dressed as a Muslim woman was caught by the Sri Lankan Police. He is one of the rouges who bombed the Sri Lankan Church. Still wonder how come all the terrorist activities are claimed by an unknown organization with names representing muslims...? \"\n\nClick here to view the post, and here for an archive.\n\nThe post has gained around 19,000 views and 1,404 shares as of writing this article.\n\nUsing InVid, a video verification software, BOOM broke down the video in key frames and performed a reverse image search.\n\nThe search results threw up a video uploaded by Neth FM, a Sri Lankan Radio station on August 29, 2018.\n\nClick here to view the video.\n\nBOOM contacted Neth FM who confirmed it was an old video circulating and said that according to their report, the man arrested in a burkha by the police in Welikada Plaza shopping mall at Rajagiriya In Colombo.\n\nAccording to the Neth FM report, he was on his way to stab a bank manager because of a conflict regarding a loan when he was arrested near the shopping mall.\n\nSomeone had tipped off the police about the man because of his suspicious behavior.\n\nThe identity of the accused is not clear from the article.\n\nThe video of the incident was recorded inside the police station after the man was arrested.", "lang": "en"}
