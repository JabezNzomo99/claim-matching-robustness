As part of this he said Covid-19\u2014the infection caused by the new coronavirus\u2014could be detected in the water supply.\n\nVideo clips of this statement have been shared via social media.\n\nA spokesperson for Number 10 has told us that Boris Johnson misspoke: he meant to say wastewater, not water supply. The spokesperson said that this alert scheme, which would involve monitoring levels of Covid-19 infection in the population through sewage, is something the government is looking into (but is not something that is in place currently).\n\nThere is some evidence showing that genetic material from the new coronavirus can be detected in wastewater and researchers in several countries have begun to assess whether this could be used as an early-warning tool.\n\nThere is no evidence that Covid-19 can be found in treated water\n\nA briefing by the World Health Organisation, published on 23 April, states that Covid-19 has not been detected in drinking water and \u201cthe risk of coronaviruses to water supplies is low.\u201d\n\nThe Drinking Water Inspectorate, which independently assesses the public water supply in England and Wales, says that the UK public should continue to use tap water as normal. They explain that routine disinfection of drinking water in the UK \u201cremoves all harmful pathogens including viruses\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
