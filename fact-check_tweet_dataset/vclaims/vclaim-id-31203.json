Kamala Harris said, \u201cOur military are soulless cowards. Their budget must be cut.\u201d\n\nNo credible sources link Harris to the quote. It actually comes from an article published on a satire website.\n\nHarris has become a popular target for fake quotes since her rise to national prominence as both a Democratic senator and a 2020 presidential candidate, with this particular statement painting her as being unsupportive of the U.S. military. (RELATED: Did Kamala Harris Say, \u2018After We Impeach, We Round Up The Trump Supporters\u2019?)\n\nThough Harris has been critical of the U.S.\u2019s military spending in the past (and voted against last year\u2019s defense budget), there are no credible sources linking Harris to the statement attributed to her in the Facebook post. It doesn\u2019t appear on her Twitter accounts or ProPublica\u2019s archive of her deleted tweets. The congressional record has no account of her saying it either.\n\nAn internet search reveals that the quote actually comes from an article published on Daily World Update, a parody news website that refers to itself as part of a network that publishes \u201cparody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
