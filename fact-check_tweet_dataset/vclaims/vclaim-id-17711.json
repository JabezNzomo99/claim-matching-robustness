So help me God.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Since the 80th Congress (1947-1949), representatives also have been required by federal law to sign two copies of the oath \u2014 \u201cone to be filed in the records of the House of Representatives, and the other to be recorded in the Journal of the House and in the Congressional Record.\u201d U.S. Code also says the copies are considered \u201cconclusive proof of the fact that the signer duly took the oath of office in accordance with law.\u201d\n\nEven though the swearing-in ceremonies won\u2019t happen until Jan. 3, social media posts shared by thousands on Facebook have spread the unsupported claim that \u201c3 Muslim congress women\u201d have \u201crefused\u201d to uphold the Constitution. There is no evidence to back up that claim.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s two \u2014 not three \u2014 Muslim women who will serve in the House. Democrats Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib were elected in November to represent congressional districts in Minnesota and Michigan, respectively. They will join Rep. Andr\u00e9 Carson, a Democrat from Indiana, who is also Muslim.\n\nTlaib, for her part, has already made public her preparations for taking the oath. She plans to wear a traditional Palestinian dress, known as a thobe, made by her mother, the Detroit Free Press reported. The newspaper also reported Tlaib \u201cis expected to use a copy of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Koran \u2014 which belongs to the Library of Congress \u2014 for her ceremonial swearing in.\u201d\n\nDeparting Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, a Democrat who in 2006 became the first Muslim elected to Congress, also used Jefferson\u2019s book for his ceremonial oath \u2014 which follows the official group swearing-in. No religious text is required to take the oath of office.\n\nOmar, who will take Ellison\u2019s seat in Congress, has said that she will probably use a Koran at the swearing-in. Her campaign told us in an email that the claims in the posts are \u201cnot true.\u201d\n\nMisinformation about Muslims and public office is nothing new.\n\nAnother recent falsehood we debunked, for example, claimed that a 1952 law \u201cbans Muslims from holding public office in the United States.\u201d It doesn\u2019t.\n\nIn fact, Article VI of the Constitution, which requires federally elected officials to be \u201cbound by oath or affirmation, to support this Constitution,\u201d stipulates that \u201cno religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nUpdate, Dec. 20: This story has been updated to include a response from Omar\u2019s campaign.\n\n2 U.S. Code \u00a7 25 \u2013 Oath of Speaker, Members, and Delegates.
