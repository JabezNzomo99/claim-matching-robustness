A website called exclusive103.com shared that false story based on legitimate reports of strikes in Syria.\n\n\"Thousands killed as Israel drops tactical nuclear bomb on Syria,\" said the headline of an April 30 post on exclusive103.com.\n\nThe story claimed an Israeli plane \"dropped the first nuclear bomb deployed in armed conflict since the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, according to local reports.\" The post said the nuclear attack targeted an ammunitions depot in Hama, Syria, and created a 2.6-magnitude earthquake.\n\nExclusive103.com\u2019s About Us section says it is \"your gallant news out-let that informs you all you needs to know about daily worldwide breaking news.\" The stories on the website are ridiculous and untrue.\n\nFacebook users flagged the April 30 post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media network\u2019s efforts to combat online hoaxes.\n\nLegitimate news outlets, including NBC News and the New York Times, on April 30 reported on missile strikes (not a nuclear bomb) in Hama with explosions powerful enough to cause a 2.6-magnitude earthquake. The strikes targeted an arms depot for ground-to-ground missiles, NBC News and other outlets reported.\n\nMedia reports said that while the death toll varied, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, at least 26 people were killed (not thousands).\n\nIsrael was the presumed attacker, but there was no official confirmation from the Israeli government. \"Israel\u2019s military does not comment on individual attacks in Syria, and a spokesman declined to comment on Sunday\u2019s attack, most likely because if Israel claimed responsibility it could put pressure on Iranian leaders to strike back,\" the New York Times reported.\n\nExclusive103.com distorted information about strikes in Syria to falsely claim thousands were killed because of a nuclear bomb.", "lang": "en"}
