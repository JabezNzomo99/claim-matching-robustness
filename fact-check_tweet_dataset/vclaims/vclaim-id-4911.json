An estimated 47,500 Defense Department personnel are in Germany.\n\nMember states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have increased spending on their own militaries since 2014. At an annual meeting this week in Brussels, the member states affirmed their 2014 pledge to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on national defense by 2024.\n\nBut NATO\u2019s members, including the United States, are still spending less money than they did during the Cold War.", "lang": "en"}
