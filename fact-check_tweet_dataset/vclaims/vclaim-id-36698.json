No, that's not true: the article comes from a liberal satire website and Ocasio-Cortez is Catholic.\n\nThe claim originated from an article published by Taters Gonna Tate on January 3, 2020, titled \"AOC Says Christianity Should Be Ignored As 'Superstitious Nonsense'\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nDemocrats are well-known for being anti-Christianity. They do everything they can to dismiss our beliefs as evil or stupid and they refuse to accept Jesus into their lives. In addition, they are often known to try to pass laws that are in direct conflict with our Christian views. One of their resident communists, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, recently relayed her opinion of the religion of the true God. She referred to the faith in question as \"superstition\" and \"ridiculousness.\" Her ignorance was on full display and it was astounding.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, AOC identifies as a Catholic, and the New York Democrat has tweeted about her religious faith often in the past.\n\nThis is not the first time that some have felt the Congresswoman's faith has been questioned.\n\nIn April, Kellyanne Conway, a counselor to Trump, appeared on the CNN show \"State of the Union\" following attacks on churches and luxury hotels in Sri Lanka and a shooting at a synagogue in Poway, California, and spoke out the Ocasio-Cortez, saying:\n\nThe site in question also has a long history of publishing satirical information. Taters Gonna Tate is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run by self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact-checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other fact-checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction to this, he has rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry extremely visible disclaimers everywhere.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites that often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past, but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nHere is a video of Blair explaining how his process works:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer, it is, of course, also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes tatersgonnatate.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard, the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
