Although delivered by the governor general, the speech is a political one since it\u2019s prepared by the government.\n\nThe interim leader of the opposition Conservatives, Rona Ambrose, criticized the speech for what it didn\u2019t cover in an interview with CBC. Among other missing items, she said, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing in this plan about private sector employment, about job creation.\u201d\n\nTo check this out, we\u2019ll look at the topic of private sector jobs rather than the verbatim words (compare a past claim about missing words).\n\nDoes the speech omit the topic of jobs and job creation in the private sector?\n\nIt does not.\n\nConsider the meaning of these references from the throne speech, if they were not about private sector jobs:\n\u2022 None A clean environment and a strong economy go hand in hand \u2026 To encourage economic growth, the Government will make strategic investments in clean technology, provide more support for companies seeking to export those technologies, and lead by example in their use.\u201d\n\u2022 None \u201cTo expand economic opportunities for all Canadians, the Government will negotiate beneficial trade agreements, and pursue other opportunities with emerging markets.\u201d\n\u2022 None \u201cRecognizing that public investment is needed to create and support economic growth, job creation and economic prosperity, the Government will make significant new investments in public transit, green infrastructure, and social infrastructure.\u201d\n\nThe throne speech does not directly cover job creation by the private sector, but it does indirectly cover job creation in the private sector. Ambrose\u2019s claim is false.\n\nDid you know?\n\nSimilar to the Liberal speech, the first throne speech under Stephen Harper\u2019s Conservatives in 2006 had no direct mention of \u201cprivate sector,\u201d \u201cjobs,\u201d \u201cjob creation\u201d or \u201cemployment.\u201d\n\nBut it would be wrong to say the Conservatives ignored the topic. The speech did cover Canadian business in \u201cthe bustling markets of Asia,\u201d and \u201cAboriginal entrepreneurs who are creating new opportunities.\u201d\n\nSee how we score.", "lang": "en"}
