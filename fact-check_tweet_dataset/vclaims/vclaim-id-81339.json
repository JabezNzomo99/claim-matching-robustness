But we are not sure where he gets the idea that Obama has tripled the national debt. (Note: some readers suggest he meant that it has tripled since 2001. If so, it is an odd locution whose meaning was lost on most listeners.)\n\nThe U.S. Treasury \u201cdebt to the penny\u201d Web site shows that the gross national debt, which includes bonds held by Social Security and the other government trust funds, stood at $10.627 trillion on Jan. 20, 2009, and reached $18.152 trillion on April 6 \u2014 an increase of about 71 percent. In terms of debt held by the public, the number has doubled from $6.307 trillion to $13.108 trillion in the same period.\n\nThe biggest problem with this kind of calculation is that every president inherits a debt from the previous one, making it virtually certain that the pile of debt is going to grow. So raw numbers don\u2019t tell you much; what\u2019s important is the percentage change in the time period being measured.\n\nAs a factoid, borrowing a million dollars a minute is correct, at least if you are looking to use round numbers in a speech. The deficit in fiscal 2014 was nearly $500 billion, and a million dollars a minute adds up to $525 billion in a year. But Paul doesn\u2019t mention that this figure is more than half the size of the deficit during the Great Recession. Then the United States was borrowing more than $2 million a minute.\n\nActually, the budget was balanced \u2014 and ran a surplus \u2014 not too long ago, in four fiscal years of the Bill Clinton administration and part of the George W. Bush administration (1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001). Republicans held control of both the House and the Senate. Believe it or not, this was only 14 years ago.\n\nWhether this is the result of brilliant planning by Clinton, a Democrat, or Republican diligence once the party took control of Congress in 1994 \u2014 or simply everyone got lucky \u2014 is of course the subject of fierce political debate. But a balanced budget amendment was not necessary to achieve the result.\n\nPaul has been critical of the National Security Agency\u2019s program to collect billions of U.S. phone records in bulk. While he did not specifically name President Obama in his announcement, Paul previously has linked Obama\u2019s administrative decisions to what Paul believes is an overreach. Paul\u2019s statement Tuesday implied that Obama started the NSA program with an executive order.\n\nBut the original program was launched in secret after the 2001 terrorist attacks, by President Bush. In 2007, Obama promised to protect civil liberties if elected president. The program was placed under court oversight in 2006, and the Obama administration reviewed it after Obama took office. The Obama administration decided to continue the program with more internal oversight. It was not until 2014 that Obama called for changes to narrow the government\u2019s access to Americans\u2019 records, following public outcry after former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked classified information showing the extent of the program.\n\nPaul alluded to these developments at the 2015 South by Southwest conference, in a lengthy interview in front of a tech-savvy young crowd. He said: \u201cSome of the programs started under Bush, but they\u2019ve been expanded. Where people voted for President Obama, they expected him to be a defender of their civil liberties and privacy, not so much.\u201d\n\nPaul largely was on point about the development of surveillance initiatives under Bush and Obama during that interview. But his announcement on Tuesday did not reflect the nuances. In fact, the announcement falsely created an impression that the current program, or the \u201cvast dragnet,\u201d began with a single executive order by Obama. We know Paul knows the difference. Perhaps it is time for Paul\u2019s speechwriter to brush up on this topic. \u2013 Michelle Ye Hee Lee\n\nPaul reinforces a myth here \u2014 that the United States borrows most (if not all) of its money from China. But as we have reported, that\u2019s simply wrong. China is a biggest single holder of Treasury debt, owning $1.252 trillion as of October 2014, but that amounts to less than 10 percent of all U.S. debt held by the public.\n\nHere\u2019s another myth perpetuated by Paul. Foreign aid is a relatively tiny part of the federal budget \u2014 about 1 percent \u2014 and very little is spent on bridges. A chunk of money is spent on development and nutritional assistance, but much of the aid is military in nature. Moreover, with the exception of Israel, countries that receive U.S. military assistance must buy U.S. products. The big winners of such deals are often American workers, so in reality that spending directly aids American taxpayers. (And yes, indeed, the biggest recipients of such military assistance are often countries where crowds chant anti-American slogans.)", "lang": "en"}
