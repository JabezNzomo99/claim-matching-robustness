Libo-Libong Patay, Nakaboto para kay Leni ayon sa Veteran Journalist (Finally Confirmed! Thousands of dead people were able to vote for Leni, according to a veteran journalist)\u201d\n\nBoth claimed the Commission on Elections \u201cconfirmed\u201d Robredo\u2019s ghost votes. The poll body made no such confirmation, and no reputable news organization has published a report reflecting the claim.\n\nWebsite Meme Buster had also already debunked similar stories last January 24 and April 7, after websites bacolod.altervista.org and localhero.altervista.org claimed 8,654 dead people voted for Robredo, while a viral Facebook post by a certain Patricia Laurel claimed the number was 7,800.\n\nThe false The Daily Sentry and News Center PH reports, which resurfaced as senators conducted July 31 a probe into alleged irregularities in the 2016 elections, could have reached more than 2.1 million people.\n\nTheir biggest traffic generators on social media are The Daily Sentry\u2019s official Facebook page and The Filipino News.\n\nThe Daily Sentry was created January 10, News Center PH on January 2.\n\n(Editor's Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.
