Being the largest of the fast food giants, McDonald\u2019s serves as the focus for a number of them, including the belief the company uses worm meat in its hamburgers or chicken feathers in its shakes to cut costs.\n\nAnother rumor attached to McDonald\u2019s asserts the company gets around truth in advertising laws regarding the meat it uses in its burgers by purchasing that commodity from a misleadingly named company. In different versions of the rumor we\u2019ve encountered, the complicit business entity is named \u2018The All-Beef Company,\u2019 \u2018100% Beef,\u2019 \u2018100% Beef Company,\u2019 or even (in the versions told Down Under) \u2018100% Australian Beef.\u2019 This legal fiction supposedly enables McDonald\u2019s to continue to advertise its burgers as using 100% pure beef even as they incorporate the meat of other animals or soy products into the patties:\n\nThere is rumor that Mcdonalds purchased a meat company called All-Beef. This allows them the ability to still use the term \u201call beef patties\u201d but use 20% meat and 80% soy product in their burgers. Mcdonalds boast that they use 100% beef in their burgers. Is this correct? i heard a rumour that they get away with this because the company that supplies them with meat is called the 100% BEEF COMPANY. While McDonalds says it uses 100% Beef in its burgers (now they claim they use 100% Canadian Beef in Canada) it in fact buys meat from a company called 100% Beef. Therefore they can put 100% Beef on their packages, advertising, etc. This create a sort of \u201cloophole\u201d that fools the general public.\n\nWhile this is a fascinating premise, there\u2019s nothing to it: McDonald\u2019s hamburger patties in the U.S. are made with 100% USDA-inspected beef. They are cooked and prepared with salt, pepper and nothing else; no preservatives, no fillers.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s of Australia\u2019s \u201cMake Up Your Own Mind\u201d web site said the following of the rumor in its Top FAQs section:\n\nThose who continue to harbor doubts about the 100% beef claim should examine the ingredient lists on McDonald\u2019s web site. All of the chain\u2019s hamburgers are made from \u201c100% beef patties\u201d; furthermore, they define \u201cbeef patty\u201d as being \u201c100% pure USDA inspected beef; no additives, no fillers, no extenders.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, McDonald\u2019s announced they would be using fresh (rather than frozen) beef in their hamburgers:\n\nIt\u2019s not as easy to get around truth in advertising rules in the U.S. as rumor would suggest. In the realm of legend a legal fiction such as a company titled \u201cAll Beef\u201d might suffice, but in the real world the Federal Trade Commission wouldn\u2019t stand for it. Under the Federal Trade Commission Act, that government entity is empowered to \u201cprevent persons, partnerships, or corporations\u201d from using \u201cunfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\u201d Consumers have legal remedy available to them against corporations that have deceived them through certain provisions of the Lanham Act.\n\nRumor usually positions the fictional \u201cAll Beef\u201d or \u201c100% Beef\u201d company as a meat supplier, but some variants post something a little different:\n\nIn a related version of the rumor, a different target (Birdseye) takes the place of McDonald\u2019s:\n\nThe \u201cAll Beef\u201d rumor matches stride with another false tale about an entity\u2019s deliberately labeling its consumables in misleading fashion to facilitate the hoodwinking of consumers into thinking they\u2019re getting better products than they are. In that other tale, Diet Coke and/or Diet Pepsi supposedly contain far more calories than claimed, but their manufacturers get away with the deception simply by paying a yearly fine.", "lang": "en"}
