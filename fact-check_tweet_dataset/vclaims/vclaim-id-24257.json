The letter states that under federal law, a citizen who uses any illicit drug, including marijuana, is barred from owning firearms or ammunition. \u201cThere are no exceptions in Federal law for marijuana purportedly used for medical purposes, even if such use is sanctioned by State law,\u201d reads the letter.\n\nThis law, passed decades ago, predates and is independent of states\u2019 decision to legalize medical or recreational marijuana.\n\nProspective gun buyers must fill out a federal form indicating whether or not they use or are addicted to illegal drugs. The form warns that the \u201cuse or possession of marijuana remains unlawful under Federal law regardless of whether it has been legalized or decriminalized\u201d at the state level. Making false statements on the form is a felony offense.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has previously ruled that a firearms ban for medical marijuana cards holders does not violate the 2nd Amendment.\n\nMore than 30 states have legalized cannabis for medical use, and 10 states \u2013 including Alaska, California, Colorado and Michigan \u2013 have legalized recreational marijuana.\n\nYet despite there being a ban at the federal level, it\u2019s not true that states where marijuana has been legalized are lining up to take away gun rights from marijuana users. \u201cTo my knowledge no state has yet to pass legislation like that,\u201d Erik Altieri, executive director for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, told The Daily Caller in an email.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m certain nothing like that has passed since the legalization of recreational marijuana in 2015,\u201d Nancy Meade, general counsel for the Alaska court system, told the Caller in an email.\n\nIn fact, Oklahoma, where medical marijuana was legalized in 2018, passed a law in March that declared: \u201cNo state or local agency, municipal or county governing authority shall restrict, revoke, suspend or otherwise infringe upon the right of a person to own, purchase or possess a firearm, ammunition, or firearm accessories or any related firearms license or certification based solely on their status as a medical marijuana patient or caregiver licensee.\u201d\n\nMarijuana legalization has received wide support among Democratic candidates running for president in 2020, and a recent poll from CBS News indicated that 65 percent of Americans support legal cannabis.
