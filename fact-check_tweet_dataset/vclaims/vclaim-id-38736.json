And really, we are just waiting. As soon as we are allowed to go, we will be there. And, you know, we do have an expert already in the field as part of CDC\u2019s continuing work with China. So, he\u2019s already in the field and therefore could be there immediately. So, we are still waiting for that invitation.\u201d\n\nMcKeogh said the CDC had begun increasing staff in China before the outbreak. \u201cWhen Director Redfield first learned of the virus, there were three U.S. direct hires, plus a deputy director on temporary deployment to China (which has continued to date), but in addition, about 10 locally employed from budget analysts to subject matter experts in flu, tuberculosis, and public health workforce, which expands our reach and workforce,\u201d she said. \u201cCDC often provides supplemental assistance for outbreaks from Atlanta or the region. CDC had the right staff to engage China and ability to provide technical assistance were it requested.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the very onset of this, when America first learned about this, we did our best to make sure that we had transparency and information,\u201d Pompeo said on March 26. \u201cWe offered to send our expert medical providers in. We offered to make sure that we could provide whatever support they needed. And instead of cracking down on the virus in a timely fashion, they cracked down on information flow. They kicked journalists out. They punished those who were speaking about this inside of their own country.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
