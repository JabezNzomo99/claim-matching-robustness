A lot of the rest of the money is spent by NHS England itself.\n\nMr Hunt\u2019s point here is that mental health is now getting a bigger slice of the pie from CCGs.\n\nThat is correct, although the figures used in his examples don\u2019t account for inflation, so the real increase in spending on mental health isn\u2019t \u00a3575 million, it\u2019s about \u00a3368 million in the last year.\n\nThis only gives us the general picture on mental health across all CCGs, it doesn\u2019t tell us anything about how individual groups and hospitals are spending money on these services.\n\nThat\u2019s also not all the money spent by NHS England on mental health as some is spent on specialised mental health services. We don\u2019t have good figures on this extra money, but the Chief Executive of NHS England says it is also spending more on mental health.\n\n\u00a3575 million isn\u2019t the total increase in NHS England spending on mental health\n\nWhen Mr Hunt said mental health spending increased by \u00a3575 million he was quoting just the increase in spending on mental health by Clinical Commissioning Groups.\n\nCCGs are responsible for planning and purchasing care in their local area, and that includes spending on mental health services.\n\nMental health spending by CCGs in England totalled \u00a39.15 billion in 2015/16, according to figures published by NHS England. This had gone up to \u00a39.72 billion in 2016/17. That\u2019s an increase of around \u00a3575 million or 6.3%.\n\nBut these figures don\u2019t account for inflation. Once this is factored in the increase in spending is actually less: \u00a3368 million and a percentage increase of 3.9%.\n\nBut other money is spent on mental health by NHS England directly\n\nThe figures above don\u2019t count all mental health spending by NHS England. We have slightly out of date figures on how much was spent in total on mental health.\n\n\u00a310.1 billion was spent in 2014/15 and \u00a310.8 billion in 2015/16. In each year around 16% or 17% of spending was done outside of CCGs, and was spent directly by NHS England on specialised mental health services.\n\nThere are also several problems with these figures. They don\u2019t account for inflation and the 2015/16 figures have been changed since to \u201ctake into account NHS England's planning guidance to clinical commissioning groups on consistent reporting of mental health spending\u201d.\n\nWe haven\u2019t been able to find any figures on this for 2016/17.\n\nLast month the chief executive of NHS England, Simon Stevens, told a committee of MPs that \u201cmental health spending by CCGs went up by 6.3% last year compared with their programme allocation growth of 3.7%.\u201d This is the same claim Jeremy Hunt makes.\n\nMr Stevens then went on to say \u201cLikewise for England as a whole\u2014the national health service in England\u2014mental health spending went up by 5.7%, when you take account of specialised services, compared with 3.4% overall growth in the NHS programme budget.\u201d\n\nNeither NHS England nor the Department of Health was able to direct us to the primary source for these figures.\n\nWhen we asked NHS England for a source for their Chief Executive\u2019s numbers, they told us to ask the Department of Health. The Department of Health told us that the comments by Simon Stevens were the best source of the figures as he made them to a committee of MPs.\n\nWe\u2019ve no reason to distrust what Mr Stevens told MPs, but this still isn\u2019t an adequate source for the figures. We should expect spending figures that are used in the public domain to be published in full so that anyone can check where they\u2019re from and how they\u2019re calculated.\n\nIt\u2019s especially important that mental health spending figures are fully explained. This is partly because of their prominence, with politicians committing to \u2018parity of esteem\u2019 between mental and physical health. It\u2019s also partly because people\u2019s mental health and physical needs and treatment can\u2019t always be neatly separated, so splitting NHS spending between the two will mean making judgements about which pounds go under which heading.\n\nOverall CCGs\u2019 budgets increased by 3.7% last year\n\nClinical Commissioning Groups spend their money of a wide variety of services, not only mental health. Overall, their core funding allocation (excluding spending on things like administration and primary care co-commissioning) increased by 3.7%, or \u00a32.5 billion, between 2015/16 and 2016/17.\n\nIn 2015/16 the spending allocation was \u00a368 billion and in 2016/17 it was \u00a370.5 billion. Again these figures don\u2019t account for inflation. The real increase was \u00a31 billion and 1.5% once price rises between the two years are considered.\n\nThis isn\u2019t necessarily the total amount that was spent over the course of these years\u2014it\u2019s the budgets that CCGs were given. We haven\u2019t been able to find figures for what was actually spent on core services in these years, only the total amount spent by CCGs.\n\nSince we originally wrote this article more information about total mental health spending across the NHS in England has been published. This showed that overall mental health spending increased by \u00a3375 million once inflation is accounted for, from around \u00a311.2 billion in 2015/16 to \u00a311.6 billion in 2016/17. That\u2019s an increase of 3.3%.", "lang": "en"}
