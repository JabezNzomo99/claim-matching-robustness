About 70,000 babies were born HIV+ in 2004, Zuma said.\n\n\u201cDue to our very successful prevention of mother-to-child transmission programme, the figure has dramatically dropped to below 6,000,\u201d he added.\n\nZuma\u2019s spokesman, Dr Bongani Ngqulunga, told Africa Check that the figure Zuma used was sourced from the national department of health.\n\nThe department\u2019s deputy director-general in charge of HIV, maternal and child health, Dr Yogan Pillay, said the figure is from a 2012 survey by the Medical Research Council, but Africa Check was unable to trace it.\n\nIn addition to infection in the uterus, an HIV+ woman can transmit the virus to her child during birth or breastfeeding. Without any intervention,\n\nto HIV+ women can get infected, according to the World Health Organisation. This is drastically reduced when both the mother and baby are treated with antiretroviral drugs.\n\nMother-to-child transmission is usually reported as a rate - that is, the share of babies born to HIV+ mothers who end up with the virus. The\n\nshows that an estimated 1.5% of babies born to HIV+ women tested positive for the virus within the first 10 weeks of their lives.\n\nNearly a third of pregnant women HIV+\n\nPillay pointed out that the number of pregnant women testing positive for HIV has remained stable over the years.\n\nwere HIV+ according to a nationally representative sample of public health facilities. This rate is much the same as in 2004\n\nshow that 169,656 babies were born to HIV+ women in the 2015/16 reporting year. At a transmission rate of 1.5%, this means that 2,495 babies got the virus from their mothers by 10 weeks of age.\n\nTransmission rate almost triples in first 18 months\n\nHowever, a scientist at the\n\n, Professor Ameena Goga, warns that the rate of mother to child transmission of HIV will vary depending on when it is measured. Goga is a paediatrician and has done extensive research on mother-to-child transmission of HIV.\n\n\u201cFor example, prevention of mother-to-child transmission can be measured using infant HIV results at birth, 6 weeks, 10 weeks or 18 weeks and 18 months,\u201d she told Africa Check.\n\n- which are the most recently available - estimated that 4.3% of HIV-exposed babies tested positive for the virus by the time they reached 18 months. Children can become infected when their\n\nthat the department aims to bring down the 18 month infection rate to less than 1% by 2022.\n\nDuring the presidency\u2019s budget vote, President Jacob Zuma said that the number of babies born with HIV in South Africa has \u201cdramatically dropped to below 6,000\u201d.\n\nThe most recent data shows that 1.5% of the babies of HIV+ women were estimated to be infected with the virus by 10 weeks of age. This translates to 2,495 babies born during the 2015/16 reporting year.\n\nHowever, it is crucial that HIV-exposed babies be kept virus-free since the mother-to-child transmission rate almost triples in the first 18 months of a baby\u2019s life. In 2014, this rate stood at 4.3%.", "lang": "en"}
