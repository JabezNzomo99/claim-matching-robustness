{"title": "The end of holiday fines?", "subtitle": "A legal case may mean that councils have to stop fining parents who take their children out of school during term time.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-6516", "url": "https://fullfact.org/law/end-holiday-fines/", "vclaim": "In April 2015, Jon Platt took his daughter on holiday to Disney World in Florida and ended up in court.\n\nMagistrates on the Isle of Wight decided in October 2015 that Mr Platt wasn\u2019t guilty of a criminal offence for taking his daughter out of school for the holiday.\n\nIsle of Wight Council had tried to prosecute Mr Platt for failing to ensure that his child attended school \u201cregularly\u201d. He refused to pay the fine that would have kept the matter out of court.\n\nAt the time, we pointed out that this decision didn\u2019t set a legal precedent that other parents could use if faced with a similar prosecution. But Mr Platt went on to win in the High Court when Isle of Wight Council appealed, and the case will now be resolved by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision certainly will set a legal precedent.\n\nThe government may have to stop fining parents for one-off school absences\n\nA victory for Mr Platt would call into question schools\u2019 powers to fine parents for taking their child on a term-time holiday. The Department for Education says that these \u201cpenalty notices\u201d can be handed out even for \u201cone-off instances of irregular attendance such as holidays taken during term time without the school\u2019s permission\u201d.\n\nBut these fines are an alternative to prosecution if a child fails to attend school \u201cregularly\u201d. If a parent hasn\u2019t committed that crime, it\u2019s hard to see how they can be asked to pay a fine to avoid prosecution for it.\n\nGranted, new regulations in 2013 stopped head teachers from being able to authorise term-time holidays for up to two weeks. Ministers were concerned that these holidays were being seen as a right rather than a privilege.\n\nBut as the High Court said in Mr Platt\u2019s case, the new regulations don\u2019t change the law. The legislation allowing for fines and prosecutions is about ensuring \u201cregular\u201d attendance\u2014it says nothing about one-off or occasional absences like a term-time holiday.\n\nIf the Supreme Court agrees, the government will have to pass new legislation to allow fines or prosecutions for one-off holidays.\n\nHave councils been issuing fewer fines while they wait to hear the outcome of the case?\n\nThe use of these fines almost quadrupled in the four years ending in 2014/15. That\u2019s the most recent official data, so statistics don\u2019t allow us to say for sure whether there has been a \u2018Platt effect\u2019 since late 2016.\n\nThe BBC says that 35 councils have \u201cchanged their policy\u201d since Mr Platt\u2019s High Court win in May 2016, based on feedback from 108 town halls. However, the story is a little cagey: it doesn\u2019t actually say that all, or indeed any, of these councils have stopped issuing fines altogether.\n\nIt does say that \u201c28 have withdrawn fines issued to parents\u201d, but individual fines are withdrawn all the time\u2014that\u2019s different from calling a halt to fines across the board.\n\nMr Platt himself has been sending Freedom of Information requests to councils to see whether they\u2019ve changed their approach off the back of his case, and publishing the results. Some councils have changed their ways, such as Cambridgeshire:\n\nOn the other hand, Durham County Council said that it hadn\u2019t changed anything, and issued more fines in the summer of 2016 than the year before.\n\nYou should be able to find your council\u2019s policy on fines for school absence on its website or by asking for it. It may be referred to as a \u201cFixed Penalty Notice\u201d or \u201cTruancy Penalty Notice\u201d policy.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of variation across councils when it comes to approving holidays\n\nAs the Mail highlights, it\u2019s also possible to find out which councils\u2019 schools were most likely to approve a term-time holiday as recently as 2014/15. That year, around one in five term-time holidays were authorised nationwide, for both primary and secondary schools. But there are big local differences.", "lang": "en"}
