The returns also would have been publicly disclosed. Noncompliant candidates would not have appeared on the state\u2019s official ballot.\n\nPresident Donald Trump notably flouted tradition in 2016 when he became the only major party presidential nominee since the late 1970s to not disclose his tax returns before Election Day.\n\nThe Bipartisan Report story does explain that only the Rhode Island Senate, and not the House, had passed the bill. But readers who didn\u2019t get beyond the headline wouldn\u2019t know that. And the story suggests that the legislation could still pass both chambers.\n\nBut despite the bill\u2019s support in the state Senate \u2014 it received a 34-3 vote on June 19 \u2014 Larry Berman, director of communications for Rhode Island\u2019s speaker of the House of Representatives, told CNN last week that the House did not have plans \u201cto consider this bill in the final days of this year\u2019s legislative session.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe House has no plans to pass it,\u201d he added. \u201cIt takes two chambers to pass a bill.\u201d\n\nWhile experts maintain that voters stand to learn much from presidential candidates\u2019 tax returns \u2014 including any potential conflicts of interest \u2014 questions remain about the constitutionality of measures mandating their release, which also have been considered in other states.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, vetoed such a bill last year, noting concerns about its constitutionality and stating that it would set \u201ca \u2018slippery slope\u2019 precedent\u201d that could lead to calls for more requirements for ballot access.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island expressed similar misgivings, saying the state\u2019s bill \u201cwould set a dangerous precedent and impose qualifications exceeding those required by the Constitution on candidates to qualify for the ballot.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\nGrayer, Annie. \u201cRhode Island latest state to try and fail to force Trump to release his tax returns.\u201d CNN. 22 Jun 2018.\n\nRhode Island Senate. \u201cS 2612 Substitute A, An Act Relating to Elections \u2013 Presidential Candidates.\u201d as passed by the state Senate 19 Jun 2018.\n\nWells, David. \u201cState Passes Historic Bill To Keep Trump Off The 2020 Ballot \u2013 Trump Prepares To Sue.\u201d BipartisanReport.com. 24 Jun 2018.", "lang": "en"}
