After news poured in that Christian Michel, the \u2018middleman\u2019 in the Agusta Westland chopper scam had been extradited from the UAE, a video clip of Ravish Kumar began circulating on social media with the claim that Kumar has reported just the opposite.\n\nThe above tweet which was posted in the evening of December 5 has garnered over 4500 likes and over 2500 retweets. Several other handles too have posted this clip, in which Ravish Kumar is saying, \u201cMy colleagues Nidhi Razdan and Nita Sharma have reported Wednesday evening that the Dubai court has not given any order/directive for extraditing Christian Michel to India. The court had simply made an observation which was not even related to Michel. But on Tuesday, many reporters, referring to sources broke this news and conducted debates\u2026\u201d (translation).\n\nThe above clip is circulating on Facebook as well, where it has been posted by a page PMO India Report Card.\n\nOther pages which have posted it include The Frustrated Indian, TheSatire.in,Bharat: An Untold Story, and Farrago Against Paid Media.\n\nIndividual users on Facebook have shared it as well, ridiculing Ravish Kumar for his \u2018reporting\u2019 of the extradition.\n\nThe video clip of Ravish Kumar circulating on social media is NOT a recent report following the extradition of Christian Michel. Alt News found that it was broadcast on the prime time show on NDTV India on September 19, 2018. The video of the same is available on YouTube and is posted below.\n\nIn the above video, the portion from 0:41 to 1:27 corresponds to the 45-second video clip which has been circulated. Moreover, Ravish Kumar\u2019s reference to Nidhi Razdan reporting that the UAE court has passed no order for extradition is corroborated by a tweet of Razdan dated September 19, 2018, the same day as the broadcast. In her tweet, Razdan reiterates that there is no court order to extradite Michel.\n\nThe same had been reported by ANI and Times of India on September 19, 2018. Meanwhile, the latest report of NDTV India on Christian Michel\u2019s extradition can be accessed here.\n\nRavish Kumar is an incessant target on social media, mostly through the use of fake, outrageous quotes but also occasionally through rumours.", "lang": "en"}
