But he needs to be careful about spreading fake news of his own.\n\nLet\u2019s quickly examine his claim that he ended up \u201cgetting substantially more\u201d from black voters than other GOP presidential candidates.\n\nHere\u2019s what the exit polls show for the percentage share of black votes in the presidential elections since 1972.\n\nTrump appears to have focused on the fact that he got 8 percent of the vote vs. 6 percent for Mitt Romney in 2012 and 4 percent for John McCain in 2008. In the polling world, a two- or even four-percentage-point shift is relatively small. It certainly does not qualify as \u201csubstantially more.\u201d\n\nMoreover, who was running as a Democrat in 2008 and 2012? Oh, yes, the first African American candidate, Barack Obama. Trump was not running against a black man, so that further discounts his claims of a substantial achievement.\n\nStrictly by the numbers, Trump actually did worse than any Republican running against a white man, though in effect he came close to tying George W. Bush in 2000 and Ronald Reagan in 1984.\n\nTrump is kidding himself if he thinks he did substantially better with African American voters. Perhaps he should be pleased he did not do worse, given some of his incendiary rhetoric. But it\u2019s not anything to brag about.", "lang": "en"}
