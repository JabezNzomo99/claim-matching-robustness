As I understand it, this company hired American lawyers, and the accusations against it just fell apart in a U.S. court,\u201d Putin said.\n\nThe comment is demonstrably false, as we will show.\n\nThe trial in the case \u201cUSA v. Internet Research Agency LLC #1:18-cr-00032\u201d has not yet begun, nor has the judge ruled on the merits of Mueller allegations.\n\n\u201cPresident Putin\u2019s characterization of this case is a classic example of mistaking arguments for outcomes. This doesn\u2019t work in real life, and it certainly doesn\u2019t work in an independent judiciary,\u201d said Christopher Swift, national security lawyer at Foley & Lardner LLP and adjunct professor at Georgetown University, in an e-mail response to Polygraph.info.\n\nThe defendant in the case \u2013 Concord Management and Consulting LLC \u2013 is a Russian firm that the indictment said had several multimillion-dollar contracts with the Russian government and has been \u201cengaged in operations to interfere with U.S. elections and political processes.\u201d\n\nThe charges against the firm consist of eight counts including \u201cconspiracy to defraud the United States; conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud; aggravated identity theft.\u201dThe indictment said Concord Management was \u201cthe primary source of funding\u201d for the so-called Russian troll farm\u2019s interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nJames C. Martin, the attorney at the U.S. law firm Reed Smith LLP, who represents the Concord Management and Consulting LLC in the U.S. District Court in Washington, DC, told Polygraph.info that \u201cthe case is still in a pre-trial stage and is active.\u201d\n\nPeter Carr, the spokesman of the Special Counsel's office, told Polygraph.info that the judge has not yet moved on these motions and confirmed that the case is active and has not been dismissed.\n\n\u201cAt this point in the proceedings, Concord\u2019s attorneys are trying to dismiss the case before it goes to trial by filing motions challenging the prosecutor\u2019s authority to bring the case on various legal grounds,\u201d Swift said. \u201cFiling a motion to dismiss like the ones we have seen in the Concord case is a standard part of any criminal defense strategy. It would be surprising \u2014 and maybe even professional malpractice \u2014 if defense counsel didn\u2019t take these steps.\u201d\n\nOn July 16, the attorneys for Concord Management and Consulting LLC filed a motion to dismiss the case, based on the claim that \u201cthe Special Counsel\u2019s appointment violates the Constitution\u2019s Appointments Clause.\u201d The motion, however, does not dispute the allegations in the indictment.\n\nThe same day, the U.S. Department of Justice countered with an argument that the defense notion \u201cshould be denied because the Special Counsel was validly appointed and is validly conducting the prosecution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that defense counsel filed these motions to dismiss does not necessarily mean they have legal merit. That is for the judge to decide, not the defense lawyers,\u201d Swift said. \u201cSometimes a judge will agree with the argument raised by defense counsel and grant their motion. But that hasn\u2019t happened here\u2026 at least not yet.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
