The team\u2019s next game is against Louisiana State University Tigers on Nov. 4 as scheduled.\n\nThis is just one of the many trending \"prank\" stories featured on Breakingnews365.net.\n\nA quick scroll to the bottom of one of these pages would reveal a disclaimer that says the site contains news \"created by users\" and therefore, \"should not be seriously taken or as a source of information.\" Yet these pages are still shared as if they were true.\n\nBreakingnews365.net is another prank site run by Nicolas Gouriou, the Belgian owner of a multitude of prank news sites.\n\nAs we have previously reported, readers should be skeptical of stories found on these type of sites.\n\nThe Crimson Tide is still eligible for the playoffs, so we rate this Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
