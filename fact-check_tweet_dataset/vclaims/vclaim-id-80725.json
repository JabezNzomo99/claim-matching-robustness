We\u2019re going to bring it back, and we\u2019re going to make America as strong as we were in the Sixties,\" he\u2019s quoted. He also goes on to say \"was a very big supporter of the Vietnam war and, of course, the troops.\"\n\nExcept Trump never said those things (although he was in Costa Mesa for a rally that day). RealNewsRightNow.com is a parody site attempting to write for comedic effect.\n\nTheir About Us page doesn\u2019t carry any sort of disclaimer, but it\u2019s apparent from the absurd biography written for alleged founder R. Hobbus J.D that the site is a joke.\n\nBesides multiple Pulitzer Prizes and Nobel Peace Prize nominations, Hobbus apparently won the fictional Stephen Glass Distinction in Journalistic Integrity, for example. Glass was a notorious fabricator of scads of people and quotes in stories he wrote for The New Republic. He was exposed back in 1998, before we used the trendy term \"fake news.\"\n\nIt\u2019s also clear from the other stories on the site that the news is fake. More recent headlines included \"TSA to give complimentary massages to select travelers during security screenings\" and \"CNN report: 1 in 5 American voters spoke to Russian ambassador before U.S. election.\"\n\nWe reached out to the site via its contact form but did not hear back. The site is registered through a hosting service with a Los Angeles address.\n\nTrump has been criticized in the past for receiving five draft deferments from 1964 to 1968. Four were educational deferments for attending college and one was a medical deferment for heel spurs. Some opponents labeled Trump a \"draft dodger.\"\n\nThe goal of the story was obviously to play off this issue. For whatever reason, social media seemed to recently rediscover the story, which many must have thought was real.\n\nBut it\u2019s fake, so we rate it Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
