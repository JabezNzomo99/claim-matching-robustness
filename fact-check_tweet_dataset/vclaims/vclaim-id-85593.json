He was criticized for appearing less empathetic toward the devastation in a long-overlooked U.S. territory, compared with his engagement with hurricane recovery efforts in Florida and Texas.\n\nWe decided to look into this issue after a reader asked us about it. (The bond amount was about $33 million, not $100 million, as phrased in the reader\u2019s inquiry.) Did Trump contribute to Puerto Rico\u2019s \u201cmassive debt\u201d by leaving taxpayers to pick up the tab after his golf course folded?\n\nThe resort already was headed toward bankruptcy by the time Trump came along in 2008. It couldn\u2019t finish renovations, so it wasn\u2019t open all year. There weren\u2019t enough people playing golf there, so the resort ran over budget just maintaining the course. Membership dwindled and staff members resigned. In 2006 and 2007, the resort had net operating losses of $5 million to $6 million, according to the 2007 annual report.\n\nIn 2008, Trump agreed to license his name to the resort, renaming it Trump International Golf Club Puerto Rico, and manage the golf course in exchange for a share of the operating revenue and annual net profits, the management agreement shows. This is a standard management deal in the golf industry, according to Golf News, and Trump leased his name for marketing purposes.\n\nTrump promised to bring the resort back into the black, but the resort kept struggling. In 2011, the resort came out with a new $28 million bond offering. The offering document shows that proceeds would be used to refund the roughly $25 million in outstanding 2000 and 2004 bonds, and the rest to pay for associated fees.\n\n\u201cThese 2000 and 2004 bonds were going to default in 2011 at least as certainly as the 2011 bonds eventually defaulted, and Trump had no meaningful role in the issuance of the 2011 bonds,\u201d said Craig McCann, principal at the Securities Litigation and Consulting Group, who has studied this case closely and has testified in other Puerto Rican municipal bond cases.\n\nUltimately, the Trump Organization walked away with more than $600,000 in revenue from the management and licensing deal. Eric Trump, the president\u2019s son and an executive in the Trump Organization, said after the bankruptcy filing, \u201cWe made many millions of dollars on it but never invested a dime.\u201d (In the bankruptcy case, Eric Trump filed a claim for about $927,000 in unpaid fees on behalf of Trump Golf Coco Beach LLC, PolitiFact Florida found.)\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s important to consider this case in the context of the bankruptcies that Trump\u2019s companies filed since the 1990s as a direct result of Trump defaulting on interest payments to bondholders, through to his irresponsible borrowing and spending practices. In this case, it\u2019s clear that Trump took on a difficult case and tried to pay back the original bonds that were about to default in 2011, but failed to do so \u2014 leaving Puerto Ricans with the same debt that they were on track to pay before Trump came along.\n\nTrump\u2019s role in the Puerto Rican economic crisis is limited, in the larger context of the recession and the history of this property, which was flailing even before he came into the picture. Even if Trump were directly responsible for all $33 million in outstanding bonds that this property incurred \u2014 and he\u2019s not \u2014 it would result in less than 1 percent of the island\u2019s debt.
