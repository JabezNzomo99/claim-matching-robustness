The archived version can be seen here.\n\nMany people have believed this viral picture and accused Mamata Banerjee of \"hypocracy\". For someone who had reportedly reacted adversely on being faced with 'Jai Shri Ram' slogans in Bengal, this image has created lots of curiosity on social media.\n\nFacebook user \"Miraj Azad\" posted this image with a caption in Bengali which when translated says, \"Theatrics! This is the same Mamata Banerjee who chased BJP supporters when they raised Jai Shri Ram slogans. She is now standing with Amit Shah and holding a Jai Shri Ram poster with a smile. In Bengal, there is no bigger RSS leader than Mamata. The Modi-Mamata fight that you see in public is all staged.\"\n\nAFWA has found that Mamata and Amit Shah are not holding an envelope with 'Jai Shri Ram' written over it. The viral image is photoshopped. During her meeting with Shah, Mamata had handed him a letter about NRC in a white envelope.\n\nMamata's meeting with Shah last week had created a lot of interest in media circles. So it took us no effort to find images and videos related to the meet. None of the images or media reports show them with an envelope with 'Jai Shri Ram' written on it.\n\nAs per a \"News18\" report, during her meeting with Shah, Mamata had raised the issue of NRC in Assam and told the Home minister that genuine voters' names are missing from the list.\n\nLater, while addressing the media, Mamata had said, \"I handed over a letter to him (Shah), told him that of the 19 lakh people left out of NRC, many are Hindi and Bengali speaking; some even Assamese. Many genuine voters have been left out. This should be looked into.\"\n\nIn the original photo, Mamata is seen handing over a white envelope to Shah.\n\nThe video of the meeting can be seen in this NDTV report.\n\nThe Trinamool Congress chief is a fierce critic of the Modi government's decision on NRC in Assam and opposed its plans to start the exercise in West Bengal and other parts of the country. Mamata has also been criticised by the BJP for her objections to 'Jai Shri Ram' slogans in Bengal.\n\nBut this viral post claiming that Mamata is holding a poster with \"Jai Shri Ram\" written on it is completely false. The viral image is photoshopped.", "lang": "en"}
