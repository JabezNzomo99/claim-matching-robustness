Further, health authorities surmise it emanated from the wet markets in China; being a zoonotic disease. And while the jury\u2019s out on the full clinical picture for Covid-19\u2019s, no evidence suggests it to be a function of moral misconduct or the activities of corrupt individuals.\n\nYesterday, Ibrahim Magu, the serving chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, (EFCC) said he firmly believes that corruption caused Coronavirus.\n\nThe serving EFCC chairman made this statement while giving his speech at the 281 passing out parade of the EFCC Detective Inspector Course-5, at the Nigerian Defence Academy, Kaduna.\n\nCoronavirus, which was renamed Covid-19 by the World Health Organisation is a common virus that infects humans, leading to an upper respiratory tract infection. The World Health Organisation defines it as a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to a severe disease named Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-COV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS-CoV).\n\nThese viruses are zoonotic, that is to say, transmission occurs between animals and humans.\n\nCovid-19 first broke out in Wuhan Hubei province of China in December 2019. The disease so far has infected over 1700 medical workers in China and 73,000 affected persons in about 25 countries.\n\nConversely, corruption is the dishonest behaviour of people; with the most impact when said people hold positions of power. It is, therefore, human behaviour and a function of choice and chance. It is also not restricted to any location, ethnicity or race.\n\nCoronavirus which broke out in Wuhan Hubei, while not restricted to location, is not a function of corruption. Health authorities surmise it emanated from the Chinese wet markets. Hence, to suggest that the viral outbreak was a function of moral misconduct is a stretch.\n\nWe surmise the acting EFCC chairman\u2019s statement to be mere sentiment and not fact!", "lang": "en"}
