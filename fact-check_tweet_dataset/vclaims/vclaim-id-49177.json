The graphic was also sent to Rappler via email for verification.\n\nThe facts: The Vice President did not say what was attributed to her. Robredo\u2019s camp said it is a fake quote.\n\n\u201cDo I still need to say it? That is a completely fake quote. And this should probably lead us to ask, what kind of people still insist on fabricating fake news to bash the VP, while the country, the whole world, is facing a crisis,\u201d spokesperson Barry Gutierrez told Rappler in a message.\n\nRappler also reached out to two of the earliest users and pages that shared the graphic to confirm their sources. Both of them did not respond. Both of their posts are still up as of writing.\n\nOn March 20, the Office of the Vice President delivered P5.3-million worth of novel coronavirus extraction kits, as well as several personal protective equipment (PPE) to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).\n\nThis is not the first time a false quote about COVID-19 has been attributed to Robredo. Rappler recently debunked a post that said the Vice President suggests \u201cinhaling cough back\u201d to prevent the spread of the virus. \u2013 Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
