That means all of the bills would be paid by one entity \u2014 the federal government \u2014 in contrast to the hodgepodge health-care system now in place. Medicare, the health-care system for the elderly and disabled, is a federal single-payer plan, but people under the age of 65 get insurance from employers, through the individual market (Obamacare) or through Medicaid, the federal-state health system for the poor.\n\nThere are many questions and uncertainties about the Sanders plan, such as cost and financing, all subject to fierce dispute. But, politically, there\u2019s been a huge shift within the Democratic Party over the viability of single-payer options, with support for the idea almost becoming a litmus test for potential presidential aspirants in 2020. During the 2010 debate over the Affordable Care Act, Democrats could not even muster support to add a \u201cpublic option\u201d \u2014 a single-payer option \u2014 to the bill.\n\nIn the case of the Bishop ad, the campaign relies on Slotkin\u2019s support for Medicare-X to justify having an elderly man ask why she wants to take Medicare away from him and \u201cbankrupt\u201d the system. As we noted, the Sanders plan in theory would actually improve Medicare for the elderly, in that it would provide more benefits and eliminate deductibles. The financing is certainly open to question, but Slotkin simply supports making Medicare an option, not the base of all health-care coverage.\n\nThe CLF relied on a slightly looser statement by Brindisi to make its case that he supports a government takeover of health care: \u201cOn universal healthcare, so I supported the New York Health Act which is a universal healthcare bill in New York. I want to see a system where everybody can have health insurance in this country and whether we call it single payer or Medicare-for-all, I know there\u2019s lots of different ideas out there, but I want to make sure that we are stopping the attacks on the Affordable Care Act first.\u201d\n\nThe Barr campaign had relied on some creative snipping. McGarth had once noted that if the United States was building a health-care system from scratch, single payer \u201cwould be the way to go.\u201d But Barr ignored the rest of her statement: \u201cBut we have a very complex health care system in America and right now we have the Affordable Care Act, that just came into effect a few years ago. I believe, as with every major piece of legislation in this country, we should try to make it work.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
