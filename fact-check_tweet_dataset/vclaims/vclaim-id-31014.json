It is the result of \"article spinning\", a practice used by shady websites to hide plagiarism by automatically replacing words in a text with words that have roughly the same meaning. Sometimes this leads to unintentionally hilarious results, for example when \"Previous first lady\" gets replaced with \"Pr\u0435v\u0456\u043eu\u0455 f\u0456r\u0455t woman\" or when \"a jaded lens of racial bias\" becomes \"a b\u043er\u0435d f\u043e\u0441\u0430l point of r\u0430\u0441\u0456\u0430l \u0456n\u0441l\u0456n\u0430t\u0456\u043en\".\n\nThe original article seems to be this one from Conservative Tribune, published on October 16, 2017:\n\nThe introduction to that version read:\n\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama has always seemed to see the world through a jaded lens of racial bias -- just like her husband, former President Barack Obama. While examples of her bias exist for days, the latest one happened Oct. 3, when she delivered a speech at the Pennsylvania Conference for Women in which she falsely accused the Republican Party of being \"all men, all white,\" according to Fox News. She based this absurd conclusion on how the audience always looked at her husband's State of the Union addresses. \"On one side of the room, it's literally gray and white,\" she said. \"Literally, that's the color palette on one side of the room.\" \"On the other side of the room, there are yellows and blues and whites and greens,\" she added. \"Physically, there's a difference in color ... because one side -- all men, all white. On the other side -- some women, some people of color.\"\n\nThe story points to this article as its source:\n\nMichelle Obama: 'Too Many WHITE Republicans in Congress - No Wonder Black People Struggle!' (Video) Michelle Obama expressed her disgust for all of the white Republican men in Congress: \"We need to fight for their seats - or they need to give up their seats!\" Michelle Obama delivered a racist keynote address that was suppose to be based on 'diversity' at the Pennsylvania Conference for Women in October and went off on how many white people there are in Congress, specifically referring to Republicans.\n\nWhile that story also does not accurately reflect the literal words spoken by Michelle Obama at least it indicates she is speaking about the racial and gender balance in Congress and not about \"whites\" in general.\n\nThe Conservative Tribune later rebranded itself to The Western Journal so the article is no longer online under the old link:\n\nOn the new website the article has been removed for not meeting editorial standards:\n\nThe article you are looking for has been archived. Some older content has been removed from this site after The Western Journal implemented stricter editorial standards. The vast majority of the archived content does meet the new standards, but we are committed to providing you with only the most accurate and truthful content we can, and therefore have archived some articles pending further review.\n\nIt is of course perfectly fine to disagree with Michelle Obama on a range of topics but it sure helps the debate to only disagree with her on things she actually said. Too many websites (often foreign-run) are copying the story with the manufactured quote in the headline to make a quick buck by reaping the advertising revenue generated by angry people liking and sharing the story without checking if it is actually true.", "lang": "en"}
