Trump however, beat Clinton in electoral votes 304 to 227.\n\nA brief aside on the way the U.S. chooses its presidents: The Electoral College was established in 1787, \"As a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens,\" according to the National Archives and Records Administration.\n\nThere are 538 total electors. A candidate must win at least 270 to become the next president. Electors are assigned to states according to the number of representatives the state has in Congress, plus two for the senators, says the National Archives and Records Administration.\n\nOreshkin made this false statement while speaking of the \u201cTrump phenomenon\u201d as not being \u201ca coincidence\u201d but a \u201cdirect aftermath\u201d of global trends. He described a deeply divided United States suffering from an economic distress and social inequality.\n\n\u201cAmerica is not a society of equal opportunities anymore,\u201d Oreshkin said, the state news agency TASS reported, adding: \u201cAmerica\u2019s shattered stability is visible in its economic performance.\u201d While the wealth in the U.S. is \u201cconcentrated in the hands of just 20 companies and 1 million people working there,\u201d the rest of the American population is \u201clost in this process\u201d and \u201cdissatisfied,\u201d Oreshkin said.\n\nHe concluded that Trump succeeded because he addressed the problems of that \u201ccast aside\u201d majority, predicting the same electorate will re-elect him again in 2020.\n\nWe make no judgment on the Russian minister\u2019s political and socio-economic analysis, other than to point out that the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis latest statistical reports show a gap in personal income, especially seen in state by state analyses amid a persistent slow growth.\n\nRegarding the 2020 election and his prediction \u2013 that is the province of political analysts. We do note the non-partisan Pew Research Center in Washington, DC reports the electorate\u2019s demographics are shifting. A Pew report finds it is \u201cunclear how these patterns might factor into the 2020 election,\u201d an indication that Oreshkin\u2019s analysis on this count might be extreme.\n\nWhether Oreshkin\u2019s analysis and his 2020 prediction is accurate, is not for this fact check to decide. But his characterization of the popular vote in the U.S. in 2016 was wrong.", "lang": "en"}
