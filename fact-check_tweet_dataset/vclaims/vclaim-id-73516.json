Several social media users on Twitter and Facebook have shared the video along with the claim, \u201cNew Zealand\u2019s PM visited a Hindu temple after declaring the nation free from COVID-19.\u201d (translated from Hindi text \u0928\u094d\u092f\u0942\u091c\u0940\u0932\u0948\u0902\u0921 \u0915\u0940 PM \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0915\u094b\u0930\u094b\u0928\u093e \u0915\u094b\u0935\u093f\u092119 \u092e\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924 \u0918\u094b\u0937\u093f\u0924 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0926 \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0942 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930 \u0917\u0908\u0964).\n\nA Twitter user @ajaykum61068972 shared the viral video drawing 100 retweets as of this writing.\n\nIt was also posted on Facebook (1,2). Cumulatively, these posts have gathered over 1,000 shares.\n\nAlt News received several requests to fact-check this on WhatsApp (+917600011160) and on our official Android application.\n\nAlt News performed a keyword search on YouTube and found that Hindustan Times posted the viral video on August 10. As per the video description, PM Ardern visited Auckland-based Radha Krishna Mandir on August 6 ahead on national elections in September. Indian envoy Muktesh Pardeshi was also present at the event.\n\nA keyword search on Twitter led us to reports by several Indian media outlets including Zee News.\n\nRadha Krishna Mandir\u2019s details are listed on the Auckland Indian Association\u2019s (AIA) website. On August 8, AIA posted the images of this event on Facebook.\n\nSimilarly, Pardeshi tweeted pictures from the event at Radha Krishna Mandir.\n\nThus the social media claim that New Zealand PM Ardern visited a Hindu temple after declaring the nation COVID-19 free is false. Ardern visited Auckland-based Radha Krishna Mandir ahead of national elections.", "lang": "en"}
