While the independent congressman met with Democrats, he \u201cwas really never an integral part of the caucus,\u201d Gephardt said. At the time, the article noted, Sanders acknowledged he had limited influence when asked why more Democrats weren\u2019t standing up to President George W. Bush. \u201cYou are asking the wrong guy,\u201d Sanders responded. \u201cAsk Gephardt.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019s attack on Biden mostly relates to a mid-1990s effort to rein in budget deficits though adoption of a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution. Biden voted for it in 1996, though it did not pass. A balanced-budget amendment by itself would not require cuts in certain programs, but in the 1980s, Biden had co-sponsored a bill calling for a one-year across-the-board freeze in spending, including eliminating cost-of-living increases for one year for Social Security and Medicare.\n\nDuring the balanced-budget debate a decade later, Biden cited that proposal to show that he cared about budget deficits. \u201cWhen I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans benefits. I meant every single solitary thing in the government,\u201d Biden said in a Jan. 31, 1995, speech on the Senate floor.\n\nSanders has long called to expand Social Security benefits. But the Associated Press found evidence that, also in the mid-1990s, Sanders said the aging population made it \u201cclear that we will have to make incremental adjustments in Social Security taxes and benefits \u2014 as Congress has done in the past.\u201d The Sanders campaign has insisted \u201cadjustments\u201d did not mean benefits cuts.\n\nAs to whether trade agreements have cost \u201cmillions of good-paying jobs,\u201d Sanders is echoing language used by President Trump. The decision to allow China into the World Trade Organization has been estimated to have eliminated about 2 million jobs because of Chinese import competition. But as we noted in a previous fact check of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), another big factor in the loss of manufacturing jobs has been automation, not trade.\n\nBiden was a longtime senator from Delaware, home of many banks and credit card companies, and one of his biggest legislative accomplishments was the 2005 passage of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act. The complex law has been under fire ever since from the left as a giveaway to banks by making it harder to declare bankruptcy. Biden has argued that, while not perfect, the law benefited consumers by lowering interest rates and protected low-income households \u2014 and that he improved what could have been a worse bill in a Republican-controlled Congress and with a Republican as president.\n\nThis is a favorite line, but the way Sanders frames it is exaggerated. His number came from a single-night survey done by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to count homeless people. For one night in January 2019, the estimate was that 568,000 people are homeless.\n\nBut the report also says that two-thirds \u2014 nearly 360,000 \u2014 were in emergency shelters or transitional housing programs; the 210,000 others were \u201cunsheltered\u201d \u2014 i.e., on the streets, as Sanders puts it. The number has been trending down over the past decade. It was 650,000 in 2007.\n\nSanders is citing a study by Emmanuel Saez of the University of California at Berkeley, which concluded that in terms of pretax income, the \u201ctop 1% families captured 49% of total real income growth per family from 2009-2017.\u201d The study also does not include government benefits such as Social Security, Medicare, food stamps and the like, which are intended to narrow the gap.\n\nSome studies have found at least half of American workers live paycheck to paycheck. For instance, an online national sample of more than 1,000 adults released in February by the First National Bank of Omaha found \u201c49 percent of U.S. adults say they expect to be living paycheck to paycheck in 2020, and 53 percent reveal that they do not have an emergency fund that covers at least three months of expenses.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
