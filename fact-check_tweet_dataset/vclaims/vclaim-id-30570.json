And because it\u2019s widely reported when the president deletes tweets \u2014 such as this one, where he wrongly referred to the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 home state as Kansas \u2014 we\u2019d expect similar coverage about a scrubbed Vermin Supreme tweet. Of course, there\u2019s none.\n\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
