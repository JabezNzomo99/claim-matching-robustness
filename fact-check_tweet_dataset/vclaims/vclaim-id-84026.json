And people need to grow some balls\n\n #NJPATH\n\nThe video Ekta Desai posted on her Facebook account can be seen below:\n\nAs it happens, Ekta Desai is also a fan of PM Modi based on this public post on her Facebook account on May 16, 2014.\n\nWhile it is extremely sad that Indians in the US are facing racial attacks ever since Donald Trump won his Presidential election based on a campaign filled with hate and bigotry, it is also time for many NRIs who extended their support to PM Modi to reflect upon their choice as to how they endorsed a man who won the elections in India the same way that Mr Donald Trump did \u2013 from riots in Muzzafarnagar to campaigns of \u2018Love Jihad\u2019 and \u2018Ghar Wapsi\u2019. In UP elections, BJP continues to pursue a communal agenda even today.", "lang": "en"}
