(RELATED: Did The Church Of The Holy Sepulchre Just Close For The First Time Since The Bubonic Plague?)\n\nHowever, the Daily Caller could find no credible evidence that the faith refunded its members three years worth of their yearly donations. Announcing such a large refund would have been picked up by major media outlets, yet none have reported on it. Nor could a statement to that effect be found on the faith\u2019s website. In fact, the online donation page explicitly states that \u201cdonations are a free-will offering and cannot be refunded.\u201d\n\nContained within the \u201cGeneral Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,\u201d a guide for church leaders, are rules governing tithing, including rule number 34.4.9 which states tithes and other contributions cannot be refunded.\n\n\u201cThe essence of all such contributions is that they are freewill offerings, made without reservation of purpose, retention of control, ownership in any form, or expectation of any benefit by the donor other than the Lord\u2019s blessings,\u201d part of the rule reads. \u201cIt is therefore improper to refund contributions given to the Church.\u201d\n\nThe claim appears to stem from a fabricated letter that circulated among African news websites, some of whom have previously published misinformation.", "lang": "en"}
