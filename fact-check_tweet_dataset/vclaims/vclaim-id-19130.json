It is being claimed that the police are beating up Kashmiris.\n\nIndia Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral video is around four years old and from Bihar. The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nThe video is being shared on Facebook with a sarcastic caption that translates to, \"Prasad distribution has begun in Kashmir.\"\n\nOn closely observing the video, we found a board that says 'Gardanibagh thana' in Hindi at 35 seconds. Gardanibagh police station is in Patna.\n\nWe ran an internet search with the keywords \"Muslims beaten up in Gardanibagh\" and found a news report published in August, 2015.\n\nAs per the report, the incident took place when the All India Muslim Majlis-e-Mushawarat (AIMMM) and madrasa teachers held a protest at Gardanibagh stadium.\n\nThey allegedly tried to go to the CM's house when they were stopped by the police. They were demanding improvement in the conditions of 2,459 madrasas in Bihar.\n\nWe also found the video of the incident posted by Mid-Day.\n\nThus, it is clear that the viral video is four years old and from Bihar. It has nothing to do with Kashmir.", "lang": "en"}
