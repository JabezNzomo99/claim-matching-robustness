It represents only the bare minimum \u2014 confirmed deaths reported by hospitals, medical providers and state health authorities as caused by covid-19. The actual number is substantially higher, but that will only become apparent after statistical modeling on excess mortality during this period.\n\n\u201cWe know that if you just look at laboratory-confirmed deaths, it is an undercount, especially in the case of flu,\u201d said C\u00e9cile Viboud, senior research scientist in the Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies of the Fogarty International Center at the National Institutes of Health, where she is part of the Multinational Influenza Seasonal Mortality Study (MISMS).\n\nViboud said that many deaths are triggered by the flu but occur later, via secondary bacterial infection or exacerbation of underlying chronic diseases, even as flu symptoms may have disappeared. So a death might be recorded as a heart attack, not as having been caused by the flu, even though the flu led to the cardiac arrest. The CDC, which tracks weekly flu deaths, also closely tracks pneumonia deaths because pneumonia is so often a consequence of the flu.\n\nFor instance, in the 2009 swine flu pandemic, 2,096 laboratory\u2010confirmed deaths were reported in the United States from Aug. 30, 2009, to April 6, 2010, the second wave. But a 2013 study that Viboud participated in concluded that the excess deaths that could be attributed to the pandemic in that period amounted to about 14,800. In other words, the official lab count in the United States missed 6 in 7 deaths.\n\nBut there already is anecdotal evidence that many deaths that stem from covid-19 are not being recorded as such. Doctors and nurses have told BuzzFeed News that deaths in the United States are not being correctly reported, in part because overwhelmed hospitals and a shortage of tests meant people died before it was determined whether they had contracted the virus.\n\nAnd in Corriere della Sera, one of Italy\u2019s leading newspapers, the mayor of the northern Italian town of Nembro reported that even though 31 people are recorded as having died of covid-19 from January to March, 158 people are listed as dead in the town \u2014 123 more than the average. \u201cThe difference is enormous and cannot be a simple statistical deviation,\u201d wrote Claudio Cancelli, suggesting that the actual death toll was four times higher.\n\nViboud said that the Nembro figures were \u201cnot entirely surprising\u201d but that they would need to be studied more closely, given that they were a relatively small data set in a limited period. She said the death reporting system in Europe is quite fast, in contrast with that in the United States, so the actual covid-19 death toll might be more quickly estimated there. In the United States, she said, the collecting of death certificates can take two or more years, so a time series analysis of the current pandemic probably could not be completed until at least 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Kingdom\u2019s numbers jumped when officials began counting deaths outside hospitals, including those in homes and care homes. Radio Free Asia and Bloomberg News reported on a large discrepancy between the official death toll in Wuhan, China, and cremation figures. The official toll showed about 2,500 deaths from covid-19 in the city, while a count of cremation urns indicated far more people had died.\n\n\u201cIn the case of a new cause of death (like covid-19), there are additional issues about incomplete capture of deaths due to the new cause, including a lack of an ICD-10 code,\u201d said Keri N. Althoff, an epidemiologist and associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, referring to a WHO medical classification list. She noted the medical classification code for covid-19 was only released the week of March 23. \u201cThere will likely be a lot of work on the ground and with statistical methods to estimating the number of deaths from covid-19 prior to the release of the ICD-10 code.\u201d\n\nTrump is comparing apples and oranges. The figures he cites for the swine flu and seasonal influenza are after-the-fact estimates that try to account for all excess deaths that could be, in some way, attributed to a flu infection. Studies indicate that the official lab counts may be missing as many as 9 in 10 deaths.", "lang": "en"}
