Mark Levin, a conservative talk radio personality, also spread this rumor and accused the media of ignoring these deaths:\n\nSix police officers were not killed in a 10-day period (circa June 2020) while working the protests against racial injustice and police violence. The article linked by Levin is several months old, is not related to the current protests, and does not list officers who were \u201ckilled\u201d or \u201cmurdered\u201d by Black Lives Matter activists.\n\nIn January 2020, the website Law Enforcement Today published an article about six officers who had \u201cdied in the last 10 days.\u201d The officers listed in this article (the same one posted by Levin) died from a variety of causes, including brain cancer, a heart attack, pneumonia, and car crashes.\n\nFrom left to right in the above-displayed image, here are reported causes of these officers\u2019 deaths:\n\u2022 Officer Munir \u201cMo\u201d Edais died \u201cunexpectedly at his home,\u201d but the official cause of death was not released.\n\u2022 Investigator John Cole Haynie died after a \u201cmonth-long battle with the flu and pneumonia.\u201d\n\u2022 Deputy Sheldon Gordon Whiteman died in a car crash while in a high-speed pursuit.\n\u2022 Officer Katherine Thine died after being dragged by a vehicle while conducting a traffic stop.\n\nThe officers listed above were not killed by Black Lives Matters activists and their deaths were unrelated to the protests in June 2020. All of these officers died in January 2020, months before Floyd\u2019s death.", "lang": "en"}
