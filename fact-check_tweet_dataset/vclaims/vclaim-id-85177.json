So that posed a conundrum: What would be a good list of promises to track that Trump was really serious about? We did not think it would be fair to rate a promise that might have been tossed out without much serious discussion by the candidate and his staff.\n\nBut Trump did issue a specific plan \u2014 what he called the \u201cContract with the American Voter.\u201d He even signed it and invited supporters to sign their own copy. That plan listed 60 promises, some of which he said he would fulfill on the day he took the oath of office. Others, he said, would be implemented or launched in his first 100 days.\n\nThis list seemed so specific \u2014 and official \u2014 that we decided it represented the ideal platform to measure Trump\u2019s claim that he would bring change to Washington and the United States.\n\nOver the course of Trump\u2019s presidency, we will track whether he is keeping to his pledges. Initially, all promises will be labeled with a neutral \u201cnot yet rated.\u201d As policies are introduced, we will provide links to Washington Post news coverage of these issues and summarize the progress.\n\nThe Fact Checker will determine, over time, whether Trump has met or failed at achieving his goals, according to five metrics:\n\u2022 None Launched: Trump has taken some sort of action, such as proposing a bill or issuing an order, to fulfill his promise.\n\u2022 None Stuck: Congress or the courts have put up roadblocks.\n\u2022 None Promise broken: Trump failed to achieve his goal or took no action.\n\u2022 None Compromise: Trump did not achieve his goal but accepted a deal that partially fulfilled his promise.\n\u2022 None Promise kept: Trump mostly or completely achieved his goal.\n\nWe imagine that a number of promises will remain in the \u201cstuck\u201d category for a while before we ultimately decide whether it merits a rating of \u201cpromise broken.\u201d\n\nReaders will be able to sort the promises by category or rating. Of course, we welcome feedback and debate as we rate the success or failure of his pledges.", "lang": "en"}
