He never said it, and neither did Biden.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nAlthough it\u2019s pretty clear this statement is fabricated and its social media misattribution has moved on from Trump to Biden, we checked out the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s recent comments to be sure.\n\nWe reviewed Biden\u2019s comments in tele-town halls, campaign ads and media interviews and found no evidence he said anything close to the statement. We also searched for it in Google and the Nexis database and found no mention of the quote \"people are dying who have never died before.\"\n\nAccording to multiple biographies, author Ernest Hemingway reportedly enjoyed using the phrase, but it isn\u2019t clear whether he was the one who coined it.\n\nEither way, Trump didn\u2019t say it and neither did Biden.
