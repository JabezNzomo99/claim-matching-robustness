Democrats such as President Obama and Republicans such as House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) either inflated or deflated the numbers to a ridiculous extent. (Before anyone asks, Obama\u2019s \u201cif you want to keep your plan\u201d was on last year\u2019s list.)\n\nIn compiling this list, which has no particular order, we primarily focused on claims that had earned four Pinocchios during the year. We also tried to focus on issues of broad interest, such as terrorism, health care and the size of government. To keep it simple, we have shortened the quotes in the headlines. To read the full column, click on the link embedded in the quote.\n\nPresident Obama repeated a claim, crafted by the White House communications team, that he was not \u201cspecifically\u201d referring to the Islamic State terror group when he dismissed the militants who had taken over Fallujah as a \u201cJV squad.\u201d But The Fact Checker had obtained the previously unreleased transcript of the president\u2019s interview with The New Yorker, and it\u2019s clear that\u2019s who the president was referencing.\n\nIntraparty slap downs are pretty rare, but Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) have radically different foreign policy views. With no evidence but Internet rumors, some promoted by liberal groups, Paul declared that McCain unknowingly met with members of the Islamic State \u2014 and even had photographs taken \u2014 when he had slipped across the border with Syria to meet with rebel forces. But the claim was proven to be absolutely false. As we said as the time, \u201cthere are days when we regret we are limited to just Four Pinocchios.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama, a former senator, got quite a few things wrong here. He spoke of legislation that would help the middle class, but he was counting cloture votes that mostly involved judicial and executive branch nominations. Moreover, he counted all the way back to 2007, meaning he even included votes in which he, as senator, voted against ending debate \u2014 the very thing he decried in his remarks. At best, he could claim the Republicans had blocked about 50 bills, meaning he was off by a factor of ten.\n\n\u201cA boy didn\u2019t want a government lunch but one in a brown paper bag\u201d\n\nRep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.), equating school lunches to an \u201cempty soul,\u201d told an evocative and supposedly true story about an official who spoke to a boy who had rejected a school lunch because he wanted one in a brown bag. \u201cA kid with a brown-paper bag had someone who cared for him,\u201d the boy supposedly said. But it turned out Ryan\u2019s source for the story had borrowed it from a book \u2013 and the boy, now grown, tries to connect hungry kids with federal programs such as school lunches and food stamps. He even opposes Ryan\u2019s budget plans. Oops. Ryan later said he regretted failing to verify the tall tale.\n\nAlison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic candidate who unsuccessfully challenged Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), stood in front of the camera and made statements that she must have known are false. Her central claim \u2014 that McConnell had pocketed $600,000 from anti-coal groups \u2014 had already earned Four Pinocchios. The statement was based on money earned by McConnell\u2019s wife, much of which came from being on a board of bank that finances coal companies. So the \u201canti-coal\u201d moniker was bogus. This desperate effort did little for Grimes, who lost even the coal counties to McConnell.\n\nDavid Perdue (R), ran ads claiming that the Points of Light Foundation once run by Michelle Nunn, his Democratic opponent in Georgia\u2019s Senate race, \u201cfunded organizations linked to terrorists.\u201d His evidence was only a leaked campaign plan for Nunn that said that this would be a bogus attack by Republicans. There was no terrorist link. Points of Light was simply a pass-through for donations from eBay buyers and sellers to charities, including one well-regarded group that had the word \u201cIslamic\u201d in its name. Nevertheless, Perdue went on to win the election.\n\n\u201cMary Landrieu voted to take away your gun rights\u201d\n\nThe imagery of this National Rifle Association ad lands it on this list. The ad opens with idyllic scenes of a mother in an upper-middle-class home checking on her baby in the crib and texting a spouse who\u2019s away: \u201cLove You. Good Night.\u201d Then an intruder is shown breaking through the front door \u2014 and the next scene depicts yellow police-line tape and an armed police officer. The ad suggests that Landrieu, in voting for enhanced background checks, made such a tragedy more possible. But even the NRA\u2019s own lawyers acknowledged that nothing in the bill would have prevented the mother in this ad from buying a weapon to defend herself, even on short notice.\n\nThe bipartisan failure in speaking about Obamacare\n\n\u201cA referendum was held in Crimea in full compliance with democratic procedures and international norms.\u201d\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin delivered a speech announcing the annexation of Crimea that was full of whoppers, but none more so than his claim about the referendum. The referendum was rushed, political opposition was squelched, and the choices did not allow for a \u201cno.\u201d (The options were either joining Russia \u2014 what the ballot called \u201creunification\u201d \u2014 or remaining part of Ukraine with greater autonomy, effectively making the region independent in all but name.) Moreover, the Crimea vote met none of the conditions for a referendum in the Ukrainian constitution. Clearly it\u2019s time for a fact-checking organization in Russia.", "lang": "en"}
