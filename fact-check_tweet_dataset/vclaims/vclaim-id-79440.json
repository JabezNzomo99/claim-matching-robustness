This image was actually taken at a music festival in 1997.\n\nThis image was circulated on social media in August 2020 as anti-lockdown protests were truly taking place in Berlin and other European cities. These protests attracted thousands of people, but they were nowhere near as large as the crowd pictured in the above-displayed image.\n\nThe BBC reported that one of the largest protests took place in Berlin, and numbered close to 40,000 people:\n\nSome 38,000 people took to the streets in the city for mostly peaceful demonstrations. Later hundreds of protesters, many from the far right, tried to storm the Reichstag, the home of Germany\u2019s federal parliament. A number of people were arrested and German politicians condemned the attack as \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d.\n\n Some of those involved had insignia from the far-right Reichsb\u00fcrger (Reich Citizens) movement. Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz said: \u201cNazi symbols as well as Reichsb\u00fcrger and Imperial German flags have no place in the German Bundestag.\u201d Rallies protesting against coronavirus restrictions took place in other European cities with some demonstrators calling the virus a hoax. Thousands gathered in London\u2019s Trafalgar Square to protest against issues including coronavirus restrictions and 5G. Signs reading \u201cmasks are muzzles\u201d and \u201cnew normal = new fascism\u201d were held up.\n\nA video from DW, a German news outlet, provides a glimpse at the actual size of these protests:\n\nWhile these anti-mask protests were sizable, some social media users started to spread images in an apparent attempt to show that they were bigger than they actually were. The miscaptioned image, for instance, actually shows a bird\u2019s-eye view of \u201cThe Love Parade,\u201d an annual music festival, in the Charlottenburg district of Berlin in 1997. The original photograph was taken by Robert Grahn and is viewable here.\n\nAnother similar concert photo was mislabeled and shared as if it showed an anti-mask protest.\n\nThe following image was shared on Facebook as if it showed \u201cyesterday\u2019s protest in Berlin,\u201d where \u201cover 1 million people marched against quarantine restrictions.\u201d An investigation by Reuters, however, found that this image was actually taken in Zurich, Switzerland, during \u201cStreet Parade,\u201d an annual techno music festival.\n\nIn turn, the Zurich photo was shared with a false caption yet again in October 2020, when it was claimed that it shows a Trump rally in Miami:", "lang": "en"}
