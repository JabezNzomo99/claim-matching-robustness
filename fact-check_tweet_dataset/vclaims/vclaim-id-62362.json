Brian Kemp as a child dressed in Ku Klux Klan regalia with his mother.\n\nThe photo dates back to at least 1956, well before Kemp was born. Kemp\u2019s press secretary refuted the claim.\n\nFeatured in the Facebook post is a black-and-white photo of a woman and a young child both dressed in robes and hoods associated with the KKK. Above the photo is text claiming, \u201cJust so you know this is Governor Kemp and his mother.\u201d\n\nHowever, Kemp is not the child in the photo, and the woman is not his mother. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Gov Brian Kemp Posing With Gregory McMichael?)\n\nA reverse image search found the photo located in the Getty Images archives. The description lists the creation date as April 27, 1956. The woman and child are not identified, nor is the location where the photo was taken.\n\n\u201cThis unidentified Klan woman gets her son dressed up real cute in KKK robes and hat,\u201d reads the original caption. \u201cThe boy doesn\u2019t seem to be too happy with the outfit, if you can judge by the expression on his face.\u201d\n\nKemp was born in 1963, according to the Georgia-based news station WGXA. That means it is impossible for Kemp to be pictured, as he hadn\u2019t yet been born when the photo was taken.\n\n\u201cThat is not the Governor or his mother,\u201d Cody Hall, press secretary for Kemp, confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Kemp, who previously served as Georgia\u2019s secretary of state before being elected governor, has been the subject of misinformation online.
