Patterson wrote, according to the report: \"Hector's a friend and fellow actor. We were both in the recent movie \u2018The Alamo\u2019, filmed near Austin, albeit on different sides in the conflict (actually Hector had a real part, I was just an extra). When Hector surrendered at San Jacinto, I should have shot him when I had the chance... \"\n\n \n\n \"I hope folks understand then we were just acting, now it's a real war,\" the item quotes Patterson saying.\n\n \n\n Contacted later, Patterson \u2014 who once helped pass Texas' concealed-weapon law \u2014 said he was joking about any shooting.\n\n \n\n \"If it's not tongue-in-cheek stuff, that's a criminal offense,\" Patterson said. \"You're not supposed to threaten people. Does this put me on the (federal) no-fly list?\"\n\n \n\n Probably not. Especially when it's all just in good fun \u2014 and he didn't really make a threat. He just expressed ex post facto regret.\n\n \n\n This is why we love Texas politics. Where else would a (pretend) gunfight spill into a (real) race for land commissioner? And where else would we get to fact check a claim like this one?\n\n \n\n For making us laugh and for reminding us not to take this stuff too seriously, we give Uribe's claim that he was threatened a rating of Pants on Fire. And we suggest that all guns remain holstered for the rest of the campaign.", "lang": "en"}
