A Biden campaign spokesman has refuted the claim.\n\nEpstein bought Little St. James in 1998, a private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, according to The Associated Press. Some of his accusers have claimed they were sexually assaulted on the island, per The New York Times.\n\nMultiple Facebook users shared an image claiming Biden owns nearby Water Island, with this particular post saying, \u201cDid you know that JOE BIDEN is JEFFREY EPSTEIN\u2019S island neighbor? JOE BIDEN OWNS NEIGHBORING \u2018WATER ISLAND\u2019!\u201d (RELATED: Did Bill Gates Visit Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s Private Island At Least 17 Times?)\n\nBut the Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any public record of Biden owning Water Island. His 2019 and 2020 financial disclosures don\u2019t show him owning property in the Caribbean, and neither do his tax returns from 2016 to 2018. Such an asset also does not appear on his 2016 executive branch public financial disclosure form.\n\nAndrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman, told AFP Fact Check that the former vice president \u201cdoes not and never has\u201d owned any property in the U.S. Virgin Islands or anywhere else in the Caribbean.\n\nBiden and his wife, Jill, own two properties: a primary residence in Wilmington, Delaware, and a vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, according to Forbes. They also rent a home in McLean, Virginia, per the Washington Post.\n\nPolitico reported in late January that Biden\u2019s brother James purchased land on Water Island in 2005 and resold a third of it to lobbyist Scott Green a year later. It is unclear whether Biden, who has vacationed on Water Island, was aware of the transaction between his brother and Green, according to the report.\n\nThe U.S. Virgin Islands Recorder of Deeds database only shows records for Biden\u2019s brother and Sara, his brother\u2019s wife.", "lang": "en"}
