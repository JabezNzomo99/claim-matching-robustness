Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, who like the school boards\u2019 group depended on preliminary spending estimates calculated by the National Education Association, the nation\u2019s largest teachers union. In February 2012, the association said that Texas schools are spending $8,400 per student this year on items such as salaries for school personnel, student transportation, school books and energy. Its breakdown suggests Texas\u2019 per-student expenditures trailed such spending in every state but two.\n\n \n\n Those calculations place Texas 48th among the states in per-student spending.\n\n \n\n And how might someone conclude, like the school boards\u2019 association, that Texas ranks 49th? The compiled figures, shown on Summary Table K in the association\u2019s report, downloadable here, reflect spending within each state plus schools in the District of Columbia, which has current estimated expenditures of more than $14,000 per student. Consequently, the Texas spending level falls 49th among the 50 states plus D.C.\n\nBy phone, Catherine Clark, associate executive director of the school boards\u2019 association, confirmed that the group relied on the NEA calculations in declaring Texas as 49th in education spending among the states. If spending in the D.C. schools figures into that conclusion, Clark said, \"then we\u2019re wrong.\"\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n The group said Texas ranks 49th in per-pupil funding among the states.\n\n \n\n Texas ranks 48th among the states, according to preliminary figures, and 49th only if one also considers spending in the schools in Washington, D.C., which is not a state.\n\n \n\n This claim is close to accurate, but without the D.C. clarification, it rates as Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
