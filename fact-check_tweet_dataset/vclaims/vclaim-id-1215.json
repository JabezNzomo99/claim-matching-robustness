This claim is partly false.\n\nExamples of such posts can be found here , here , and here .\n\nHallmark is a family-owned company based in Kansas City, Missouri. Its website states: \u201cMost Hallmark greeting cards sold in the United States are produced here by Hallmark employees in our greeting card production center in Lawrence, Kansas. Hallmark cards with specialized processes, such as die cut, glitter, flock and foil stamp are produced in Lawrence. Most of Hallmark wrapping paper, ribbons and bows are made at our manufacturing plant in Leavenworth, Kansas.\u201d (here)\n\nA Hallmark representative told Reuters via email that Hallmark prints 70% of its greeting cards at its facility in Lawrence, and that the company is \u201cmaking plans to produce even more of them there.\u201d For the 30% of Hallmark cards produced elsewhere, the company partners with suppliers in China, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka.\n\nAmerican Greetings is a Hallmark competitor mentioned in some of the social media posts. The company is headquartered in Westlake, a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, and its domestic operations include facilities in Greeneville, Tenn., Ripley, Tenn., Danville, Ky., and Osceola, Ark. (here). Some of their cards are also made in China, like Hallmark's. A spokesperson told Reuters via email that \u201cthe majority of greeting cards and gift wrap are manufactured in the US\u201d but that some products are sourced from China and other Southeast Asian countries. American Greetings did not respond to a Reuters request for a percentage breakdown of their domestic vs overseas production.\n\nPosts like these have circulated in the context of mounting calls to boycott Chinese goods amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019. In early April, for example, Senator Rick Scott (R-Fla.) said on the podcast The Charlie Kirk Show, \"No one should buy anything from communist China\" ( here ). As reported by Newsweek, Scott said that American consumers will want to boycott Chinese goods after the coronavirus pandemic and urged U.S. resale companies to list where items are produced.\n\nCalls from U.S. leaders to shift away from reliance on Chinese manufactured goods are bipartisan, with both President Donald Trump and presidential candidate Joe Biden promising to revive domestic production ( here , here ).\n\nPartly false. Most Hallmark cards are produced in Lawrence, Kansas, but some are made in China, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
