They will use it till university.\u201d \u2013 Hope For Nigeria\n\nEVIDENCE: A quick search on Tineye and Google image reverse search reveals that the post is not true. The event is believed to have occurred in Kenya, not Nigeria!\n\n\n\nFacebook user, Hope for Nigeria, on 24th February 2018 posted on its page: \u201cThe Imo State Government reportedly donated school shoes to their students. They will use it till university.\u201d The post generated 1,400 comments and was liked over 3,200 times.\n\nThe pictures attached to the post show children hugging adult-sized shoes. And a lot of people believed \u2013 and shared \u2013 the post because the Governor of the State, Rochas Okorocha has carved an image for himself as a controversial chief executive.\n\nTo the contrary, a quick search on Tineye and Google image reverse search reveals that the post is false.\n\nTineye, the reverse image search engine, shows that the picture first surfaced online in August 17, 2017 on tweetiz.com. The picture taken by \u201cfb/kenlove360\u201d has the caption: \u201cGrace Mugabe has donated shoes to a local village school in a bid to win support as she prepares to take over presidency after Robert Mugabe.\u201c\n\nGoogle image reverse search also revealed the stories written by some online mediums, all crediting the story to a post by Facebook User Timo Sem, who had posted on his page: \u201cMachakos Governor Alfred Mutua has donated shoes to primary school pupils.\u201d\n\nDubawa also contacted Mr. Okodili Ndidi, the Imo State Correspondent of The Nation newspapers. Ndidi has been covering Imo State since 2011.\n\nHe told Dubawa that the claim is FALSE. He said when the story broke last year, he tried to fact-check and he discovered that it was false. The State Government, he added, had debunked the claim. He also pointed out that the last time the state government distributed shoes to schools was in 2012. What the state government distributed to schools last year were bags!\n\nThe post that the Imo state government donated oversized shoes to pupils of the state is FALSE. The event happened in Kenya and not in Nigeria.", "lang": "en"}
