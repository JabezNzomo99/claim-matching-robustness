The full text of the hoax read:\n\n16 year old Lucaya found dead november 4 on saturday after being drugged raped and killed. She was out with her friends and they agreed to sell her for $500 and weed. The police is under investigation for this poor 16 year old girl from chicago\n\nAs you coud probably tell from the horrific spelling and grammar alone the story is not true. Why would the police be under investigation? Why repeat her age? Who needs to use capital letters anyway?\n\nThe picture used with the story is just a random snap that pops up if you search for 'curly deep wave sew' on Google images, it seems it is an image used in a lot of websites about hairstyles.\n\nAnd of course trend-news.com is a prank website where users can submit their own headline, description and photo to create realistic looking prank news articles. It carries following disclaimer at the bottom of each page:\n\nRape and murder could probably be considered humorous fantasy fiction news by some. But fortunately you don't have to take it seriously or as a source of information...\n\nUsers don't even need to upload their own image, there is a built-in search function that will pull an appropriate image from Google image search.\n\nThe site is part of a larger network of prank sites all using the same basic layout but sometimes in different languages. It appears to be run by a Belgian company named Mediavibes or Media Vibes which is managed by a man named Nicolas Gouriou according to registration records.\n\nSo don't fall for this prank now that we've warned you about it!", "lang": "en"}
