Will Smith Diagnosed With Life Threatening Disease And Rushed To Hospital.\u201d The video consisted of a slideshow of still images of Smith, accompanied by a voice-over narrator reading a Nov. 12 article by AmoMama, a news and entertainment website targeted to a female audience.\n\nThe source of the narrator\u2019s script was not acknowledged in the video, and the AmoMama article never claimed that Smith had been diagnosed with a \u201clife-threatening disease\u201d or \u201crushed to hospital.\u201d In fact, the article pilfered by Stars News in its video clearly explained that Smith had vlogged about his first colonoscopy, a routine procedure, as a way to spread awareness. He was therefore not \u201crushed to hospital.\u201d\n\nIn reality, Smith underwent a routine colonoscopy in Miami, Florida, in August 2019, and recorded snippets of his experience, which he posted to his Instagram profile in November, along with a full, 17-minute version, which he posted to YouTube:\n\nTowards the end of that video, Smith\u2019s physician Dr. Ala Stanford informs him that the doctor who performed the colonoscopy had discovered and removed a polyp (small tissue growth) from his colon, adding that it was a pre-cancerous tubular adenoma (the most common form of polyp found in the colon).\n\nThere had been no complications in the removal of the polyp, Stanford told Smith, adding that such growths can sometimes develop into cancerous growths, and that Smith\u2019s willingness to undergo the routine colonoscopy had allowed the doctors to discover the polyp early on, and had potentially prevented cancer from developing.\n\nThe only negative consequence from the discovery and removal of the growth, she added, was that Smith would now have to undergo another screening in two or three years, rather than the typical interval of 10 years.\n\nSmith was not diagnosed with a life-threatening disease, nor any disease, and he was not \u201crushed to hospital.\u201d Rather, on the advice of his doctor, he underwent pre-scheduled colon screening which is routine and recommended, especially for people aged in their 50s. That screening revealed a tissue growth that has the potential to become cancerous (but had not yet done so), and that growth was successfully removed without complications.\n\nThe Stars News YouTube video consisted of a voice-over script taken from an uncredited source, with a \u201cclickbait\u201d headline that falsely claimed Smith had been \u201crushed to hospital\u201d and \u201cdiagnosed with a life-threatening disease.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
