The claims are false; the images show two separate, unrelated 2018 arrests; police told AFP they have not detained anyone over the recent killing.\n\nThe posts, which can be seen here and here, contains a screenshot and a video that they claims show men who have been arrested over the March 2019 killing and mutilation of a 16-year-old girl in the southern city of Lapu-Lapu.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of one of the posts:\n\nThe misleading posts' headline, when translated to English, says: \u201c3 suspects who killed the 16-year old rape victim in Lapu-Lapu city who was also skinned have been arrested\u201d.\n\nThe killing of girl has attracted widespread media attention in the Philippines, for example here, with President Rodrigo Duterte expressing anger over the incident.\n\nA reverse image search traced the photo of the three men used in the misleading posts back to this YouTube video about the arrest of six young Filipino men in 2018 over claims they had smoked marijuana.\n\nThe image used in the misleading post appears at 5:52 in the video. It is a screengrab which has been flipped from the original.\n\nAFP did a fact-check post on the young men in the marijuana case.\n\nUsing search engine aggregator IntelTechniques, AFP traced the pixelated image in the misleading post to similar pictures of the murdered girl that have appeared in the Philippine media, for example here.\n\nBelow is a screengrab of the photo of the victim that appeared in Philippine media:\n\nThe photo in Philippine media and the misleading post both show a person lying on their left side, with the right arm crossed over the chest in a grassy area.\n\nThe misleading post also contains a video.\n\nClicking on the video leads to a Philippine news programme report which was uploaded to YouTube on July 14, 2018.\n\nThe news report is about the July 2018 arrest of three suspects over a rape case in the the central province on Bulacan.\n\nThe police city director for Lapu-Lapu told AFP that they had not arrested any suspects over the March 2019 murder and skinning case.\n\n\u201cNo, we have not done any arrests yet. We are still pursuing them, hunting them down,\u201d Police Senior Superintendent Limuel Obon said in a phone interview on March 13, 2019.\n\nThe post has been shared over 200 times.", "lang": "en"}
