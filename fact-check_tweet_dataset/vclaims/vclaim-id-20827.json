No, that's not true, this story was created by a military satire website, it is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Duffel Blog on June 12, 2018 titled \"Trump Tower opens in Pyongyang\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nYONGYANG -- A Trump Tower has opened in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, in what is being hailed as a breakthrough after a historic meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un. It is the first Western hotel to open in the secretive country, which is often called the \"Hermit Kingdom.\" \"You know, they tell me this is the finest hotel in, literally, all of Asia. You can't beat it. And it serves the most delicious tacos,\" Trump told reporters. \"Highly recommended for journalists when they go to cover the denuclearization of North Korea!\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nBut the picture was obviously photoshopped and showed the \"Trump\" logo pasted on a picture of the (real) Ryugyong Hotel in Pyongyang.\n\nThis 300-meter-high skyscraper would be an imposing presence in any city's skyline. In Pyongyang, North Korea it dwarfs every other structure in sight, dominating not only the skyline but the city itself. It is North Korea's largest building, and yet it remains for the moment, unfinished.\n\nThe website Duffelblog.com is a military-themed satire website which sports following legal disclaimer on its 'about' page:\n\nWe are in no way, shape, or form, a real news outlet.
