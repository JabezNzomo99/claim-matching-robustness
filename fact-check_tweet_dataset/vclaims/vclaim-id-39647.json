His book, \u201cThe Prince,\u201d which details his political philosophy, helped establish him as an important figure in modern political theory.

Nowhere in this work, or any of his others, does the saying attributed to him in the Facebook post appear.\n\nIndeed, Princeton University politics professor Maurizio Viroli told the Daily Caller News Foundation that he had not encountered it in any of Machiavelli\u2019s writings. \u201cHe detested and condemned fraud and deception eloquently,\u201d said Viroli in an email. \u201cSee, for instance, Discourses on Livy, III.40. He wrote that the prince should learn to use deception or force, if necessary, but he never wrote the statement you have cited.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cDiscourses on Livy,\u201d as Viroli pointed out, Machiavelli writes, \u201cAlthough the use of fraud in every action is detestable, nonetheless in managing war it is a praiseworthy and glorious thing, and he who overcomes the enemy with fraud is praised as much as the one who overcomes it with force.\u201d\n\nThe quote may be a paraphrase of Machiavelli\u2019s work. It also resembles a quote found in Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu\u2019s \u201cArt of War,\u201d which reads, \u201cAll warfare is based on deception.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
