It doesn\u2019t.\n\nTrump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, also claimed, \u201cHillary Clinton received a classified intelligence report stating that the Obama administration was actively supporting Al Qaeda in Iraq, the terrorist group that became the Islamic State.\u201d That\u2019s not what the \u201cintelligence report\u201d said.\n\nTrump first touted the article from Breitbart on Twitter on June 15:\n\nThat tweet came after he made vague comments on June 13 that President Obama had \u201csomething else in mind\u201d that was \u201cinconceivable\u201d in regards to terrorism and the Orlando mass shooting.\n\n\u201cLook, we\u2019re led by a man that either is not tough, not smart, or he\u2019s got something else in mind,\u201d Trump said on Fox News. \u201cAnd the something else in mind \u2014 you know, people can\u2019t believe it. People cannot, they cannot believe that President Obama is acting the way he acts and can\u2019t even mention the words \u2018radical Islamic terrorism.\u2019 There\u2019s something going on. It\u2019s inconceivable. There\u2019s something going on.\u201d\n\nTrump refused to explain what he meant. \u201cI\u2019ll let people figure that out for themselves,\u201d he told radio talk show host Howie Carr in an interview on June 13.\n\nWhen the Washington Post ran an article headlined \u201cDonald Trump suggests President Obama was involved with Orlando shooting\u201d (which was later changed to say, \u201cDonald Trump seems to connect President Obama to Orlando shooting\u201c), Trump said he was banning the Post from covering his events. But now he claims he was \u201cright\u201d about the implication.\n\nTrump then tied Clinton, the Democratic presumed presidential nominee, to the claim in a Facebook post on June 15: \u201cHillary Clinton received a classified intelligence report stating that the Obama administration was actively supporting Al Qaeda in Iraq, the terrorist group that became the Islamic State.\u201d He again linked to a June 14 Breitbart report, which makes that allegation, too. But the government memo it cites doesn\u2019t support that claim.\n\nThe August 2012 Defense Intelligence Agency memo, which was posted online by the group Judicial Watch last year, says it is an \u201cinformation report, not finally evaluated intelligence.\u201d It describes \u201cthe general situation\u201d in Syria:\n\nThe memo goes on to say, \u201cAQI supported the Syrian opposition from the beginning.\u201d\n\nSo, the U.S. and al Qaeda in Iraq both opposed the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad. But concluding that that means the U.S. supported AQI is false logic. And such a leap would mean \u201cthe West, Gulf countries, and Turkey\u201d were all in on it, too.\n\n\u201cThe US never supported AQ in Iraq \u2013 not sure where that came from,\u201d Andrew Tabler, the Martin J. Gross fellow in the Program on Arab Politics at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told us in an email.\n\nPerry Cammack, an associate in the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and formerly a Middle East policy staffer of Secretary of State John Kerry, said the claim was wrong both in terms of its illogical reading of the memo and \u201cin terms of the history of the Obama administration\u2019s Syria policy.\u201d\n\nHe calls the Breitbart article \u201camazingly poor reporting\u201d and says it\u2019s \u201csilly\u201d to present the memo as some kind of smoking gun.\n\n\u201cIf anything the Obama administration has been criticized for doing too little to support the Syrian opposition, and it\u2019s frankly for exactly this reason,\u201d Cammack told us in a phone interview.\n\nIn May 2012, a few months before the DIA memo, Obama was criticized by Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, for not arming the Syrian opposition to fight against the Assad regime. The administration\u2019s concern was having those weapons fall into the wrong hands. In 2014, former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said the administration should have armed rebels sooner \u2014 a position Hillary Clinton has also taken. By October 2015, the administration abandoned a program to train and equip a new rebel force to fight the Islamic State, and said instead it would provide equipment to other existing groups.\n\nTabler, who lived in the Middle East for 14 years, co-founded an English-language magazine in Syria and authored the 2011 book \u201cIn the Lion\u2019s Den: An Eyewitness Account of Washington\u2019s Battle with Syria,\u201d said the argument linking the administration to the Islamic State seemed to come from the idea that U.S. policy led to the creation of the Islamic State, but the U.S. supported the non-jihadist opposition.\n\n\u201cThe reason for the growth of terror groups in Syria is due to the breakdown of the Assad regime (which controls now only 1/3 of Syrian territory) due to its response to the Syrian uprising,\u201d Tabler said. \u201cThe US supported the non-jihadist opposition, not Jihadists like AQ\u2019s Jebhat al-Nusra.\u201d\n\nIn fact, al-Nusra (or the Nusra Front) was designated a foreign terrorist group by the Obama administration in December 2011. The State Department memo on the designation called the Nusra Front an \u201calias\u201d of al Qaeda in Iraq, which the U.S. had declared a foreign terrorist group in 2004.\n\nThat State Department memo said that through 600 attacks since November 2011, \u201cal-Nusrah has sought to portray itself as part of the legitimate Syrian opposition while it is, in fact, an attempt by AQI to hijack the struggles of the Syrian people for its own malign purposes.\u201d The memo highlighted the United States\u2019 \u201cnon-lethal\u201d and humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people.\n\n\u201cThe violent, sectarian vision of al-Nusrah is at odds with the aspirations of the Syrian people, including the overwhelming majority of the Syrian opposition, who seek a free, democratic, and inclusive Syria and have made clear their desire for a government that respects and advances national unity, dignity, human rights, and equal protection under the law \u2013 regardless of faith, ethnicity, or gender,\u201d the State Department memo said.\n\nRobert Ford, who was U.S. ambassador to Syria from 2011 to 2014, told the Washington Post that the memo highlighted by Breitbart had been \u201ccirculating on the Internet for years\u201d and that it was likely a report of a briefing by the Iraqi military. Ford has criticized the administration\u2019s policy in Syria.\n\nAs for this memo going to Clinton when she was secretary of state, Cammack said the fact that it lists \u201cRUEHC/SECSTATE WASHINGTON DC\u201d as a recipient \u2014 something Breitbart noted \u2014 is \u201cmeaningless.\u201d The memo likely would have been read by \u201cworker bees,\u201d and potentially incorporated into a briefing for the secretary.\n\nIndeed, State Department spokesman John Kirby told the Washington Post Fact Checker that \u201c[a]ll reports that come to Washington have that address\u201d and that \u201cit does not indicate it was sent to the secretary of state or the secretary\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nCammack said it was \u201coutrageous\u201d that any American president would be accused of supporting a terrorist group bent on destroying the U.S.\n\nWe agree. It\u2019s the kind of claim that we\u2019d debunk in an article on viral conspiracy theories.\n\nUpdate, June 17: Michael Morell, the deputy director and acting director of the CIA from 2010 to 2013, who also served under the Bush administration, wrote a June 16 piece for Politico, saying that Trump \u201cresurrected an old conspiracy theory \u2026 that has no place in our public discourse.\u201d Morell wrote that the Obama administration \u201cwent to great lengths to ensure that any aid provided by the United States to the opposition would not fall into the hands of extremists, including the Islamic State and Al Qaeda.\u201d He said the DIA memo was the view of one DIA official in Iraq, and \u201cit was simply wrong in its facts when it indicated that the West was supporting extremists in Syria.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
