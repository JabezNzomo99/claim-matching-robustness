No, that's not true, the story was made up by a site that invents tales of bizarre crimes and weird sex acts for entertainment purposes. It did not happen for real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by World News Daily Report on July 16, 2018 titled \"Teen on 'female Viagra' crashes into building while masturbating to gear shift\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nBowling Green, KY | A Kentucky teenager who has crashed her parents' vehicle into the house of a citizen of Warren County has admitted she was under the influence of alcohol, ecstasy, and counterfeit female Viagra. The 17-year-old, whose name has not been disclosed by authorities, told officials she had lost control of the parked vehicle after she had an \"uncontrollable urge to masturbate\" according to the official Bowling Green Police Department report. The young woman allegedly lost control of the parked vehicle after inserting the gear shift inside her vagina in what she described herself as an ultimate attempt to \"stop being horny.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail so some might have mistaken it for a real news report:\n\nHowever the image of the car crash is actually from a 2016 accident in Concord, New Hampshire, as reported by Patch:\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories.
