All our products are thoroughly assessed to ensure they meet our high quality and safety standards as well as British and international regulatory standards.\u201d\n\nBuckinghamshire and Surrey Trading Standards have a primary authority partnership with Unilever in the UK, meaning they work with them offering advice and notifying them of complaints about their products.
