But they carried wrong photos of a military convoy.\n\nSix days into the enhanced community quarantine imposed by Pres. Rodrigo Duterte on the whole of Luzon on March 16, at least five netizens and two Facebook (FB) pages -- Tweet Post. and Blessed Be Philippines -- published on March 22 a post advising Filipinos to stay at home and pray. The post carried an image of army vehicles driving through a city road.\n\nThe seven posts had similar captions claiming it was not an \u201carmy parade\u201d but a convoy of 80 trucks carrying bodies of COVID-19 patients in Italy who all died in one day.\n\nThe posts are false. The circulating image was taken in France, not Italy, and unrelated to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nThe earliest online copy of the photo could be traced to a March 17 tweet of a netizen, with a caption in French that translates to \u201cThe army arrives at Charenton\u2026\u201d She also wrote the hashtag #restecheztoi, which means, \u201cStay at your house.\u201d\n\nCharenton, short for Charenton-le-Pont, is a commune or municipality in Paris, France.\n\nSpecifically, it was taken in the intersection of Rue de Paris and Avenue Anatole France. Google Maps\u2019s Street View of the thoroughfare shows elements visible in the viral image -- the Charenton-le-Pont branch of French pharmacy Pharmacie du march\u00e9; the crosswalk; road signs; as well as the information board in front of the pharmacy.\n\nA Google search of Pharmacie du march\u00e9 branches around the world shows they exist only in France and at a French region called R\u00e9union near Madagascar in the Indian Ocean; none in Italy.\n\nIn a March 17 fact check by Agence France-Presse, the French Ministry of the Armed Forces said the army trucks spotted at Charenton-le-Pont were unrelated to the health emergency. \"The trucks ... belong to a logistical movement unrelated to the coronavirus crisis,\" it said, as translated from French.\n\nThe inaccurate FB posts surfaced three days after several news organizations reported on March 19 that Italy had to transport the bodies of COVID-19 victims in military trucks from Bergamo for burial in other Italian cities and towns since local churches and crematoriums in the city could no longer handle the volume of corpses.\n\nOne such photo was indeed used by the netizen who published the false post. However, as cited in the media reports, only 15 trucks -- not 80 -- were used in the transport of the bodies, according to an army spokesman.\n\nTo date, Italy has over 74,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases -- second to China, the epicenter of the outbreak, which has more than 81,000 positive cases.\n\nThe European nation, however, has surpassed China\u2019s death toll, now at a record 7,500 fatalities, more than double China\u2019s numbers.\n\nThe seven inaccurate FB posts have an accumulated total of about 9,300 reactions, more than 600 comments, and almost 40,000 shares.\n\nFB Pages Tweet Post. and Blessed Be Philippines were created on Aug. 7, 2019 and Nov. 23, 2016, respectively.", "lang": "en"}
