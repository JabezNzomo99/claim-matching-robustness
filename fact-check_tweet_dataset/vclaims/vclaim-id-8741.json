These include household surveys where relatives are asked how their loved one died to identify the probable cause of death (called verbal autopsy), data from a sample registration system, such as the deaths recorded in a specific hospital, or from specifically planned studies.\n\nThe most recent data on global mortality rates by causes can be found in the WHO\u2019s 2016\n\n.
