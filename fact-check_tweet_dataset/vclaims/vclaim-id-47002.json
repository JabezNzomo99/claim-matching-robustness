Media outlets have covered the case.\n\nThe Facebook post appears to reference an ongoing appeals court case involving Clinton and the conservative government watchdog group Judicial Watch. In March, a federal judge ruled that Clinton must testify at a deposition about her use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state, according to CNBC. Clinton has appealed that decision, and the matter has gone to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n\nBut contrary to what the post alleges, Clinton has not lost the case. The appeals court has yet to rule on the matter at the time of publication.

Circuit, in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nThe claim that Clinton lost the appeal appears to stem from websites such as Magamedia.org and Where Is The Buzz that ran stories erroneously alleging she lost the appeal. Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, attempted to set the record straight on Twitter by responding to Magamedia.org\u2019s story, which has since been updated.\n\n\u201cAppreciate the kind words, but this isn\u2019t correct,\u201d Fitton tweeted. \u201cThe appeals court has not yet ruled.\u201d\n\nThe Facebook post\u2019s claim that no news organizations have covered the case doesn\u2019t hold up either. Numerous media outlets, including CNN, CNBC and Politico, covered the initial March ruling. Politico, Law.com, Law 360 and others wrote about the June 2 hearing.\n\nThe entirety of the audio from the roughly hour-and-a-half June 2 hearing can be found on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit\u2019s YouTube page.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
