Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.\n\nIn one post published Dec. 23, AJUAnews.com claimed the Democratic representatives said they want to get rid of government benefits for seniors. Several links on the website try to get readers to download anti-virus software they don\u2019t need.\n\n\"They intend to screw over our greatest generation by removing from them everything that we have earned over the years,\" the article reads. \"The two held a joint press conference yesterday to announce their intention to remove from senior citizens what they termed \u2018entitlements\u2019, such as Social Security and Medicare.\"\n\nThe story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared more than 18,000 times.\n\nThe article is fake \u2014 its source is a website that publishes satire. And we\u2019ve previously debunked similarly false stories from AJUAnews, which was created in early December, according to WhoIs data.\n\nThe article about Ocasio-Cortez and Omar was originally published by Daily World Update, a website that purports to publish political satire. The site is run by Christopher Blair, a liberal who tries to trick conservatives into sharing made-up stories on social media.\n\nThe original story has several labels warning that it\u2019s satire. But AJUAnews\u2019 version includes only one small, hard-to-read disclaimer, and several Facebook users and pages have shared the story with the assumption that it\u2019s true.\n\nThere was no press conference for cutting entitlements. In fact, both congresswomen have spoken in favor of Medicare for All, which would change the private insurance system to a government-run approach that would cover most Americans.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has also advocated for the Social Security 2100 Act, which aims to raise the program\u2019s benefits \u2014 including those provided by Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance.\n\nThe article is inaccurate and makes a ridiculous claim. We rate it Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
