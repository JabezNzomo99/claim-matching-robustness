However, that the technology has improved doesn\u2019t mean these cinematic offerings can as yet do real things. Common sense should tell folks one cannot become pregnant from viewing a pornographic film.\n\nA purported May 2010 news story about a woman who claimed she\u2019d gotten in the family way from watching a risqu\u00e9 movie spread via and social networking sites. According to its lights, the wife of a GI serving in Iraq presented her husband with a black baby upon his return, claiming the child was fathered by the 3D film she\u2019d viewed with friends in New York:\n\nMany who read the article were quick to conclude the wife had fabricated what she believed was a likely cover story to help explain to her husband the presence of a racially-different baby in their marital home (as opposed to telling him the truth about what she\u2019d been up to while he was off serving his country), something that obscured the actual point of the hoax, which had nothing to do with slipping something past a gullible spouse.\n\nThis wild tale of movie viewership gone wickedly awry wasn\u2019t an actual news story. It was instead a humor piece presented to the public at large on 2010 by the Brazilian satirical news site Sensacionalista, a publication whose slogan translates as \u201cThe newspaper exempt from truth.\u201d\n\nIn the original Sensacionalista leg pull, which was written in Portuguese, the trusting American soldier\u2019s name was rendered as \u201cErick Jhonson\u201d (note the unusual spelling of the first name and wild misspelling of the surname, errors that later pranksters would correct by changing the GI\u2019s name to \u201cErik Johnson\u201d).\n\nThen and now, the \u201cclipping\u201d circulated on the Internet included a photo of a smiling brunette Caucasian woman holding aloft a dark-skinned toddler. Whoever the woman and child actually are, they are not the mother and child of the fictitious \u201cPorn caused my pregnancy\u201d story. Said photograph was discovered online by Sensacionalista and used in their fake report without permission of the woman depicted in it. Such unauthorized usage resulted in the issuance of an apology to the folks who had been wronged. Said the satire site in its mea culpa:\n\nA week ago we published an article about a woman who claimed to get pregnant after watching a 3D porn movie. The article was fake and we used a photo that we found on the internet. Unfortunately, the article spread around the world because some sites thought that it was real. That was not our intention. Sensacionalista is a small site from Brazil. We never thought that this could happen. That\u2019s why we are asking this family to accept our sincere apology. That woman and her baby in the photo had nothing to do with this article. They are just a normal family trying to live they\u2019re [sic] own lives. We apologize for taking their photo and wrongfully putting it in our article. Please, do not publish this article again and next time check what you read before you write. This site is a humor site. Nothing here is real.", "lang": "en"}
