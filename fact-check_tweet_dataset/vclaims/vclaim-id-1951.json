It then looked at the number of people reporting difficulties in these areas who said they either received no assistance or who did not receive enough assistance.\n\nIf you add in the over 65s who report they didn\u2019t receive enough help with essential activities such as taking medication or preparing food, the total rises to around 1.5 million.\n\nWe\u2019ve looked at Age UK\u2019s findings before and have already highlighted that it could be clearer in explaining how it reached the 1.2 million figure, for instance showing which population figures it has used to arrive at the headline figure.\n\nThat said, the King\u2019s Fund think tank has warned separately that \u201cdefining, let alone measuring, the extent of unmet need is fraught with difficulty.\u201d\n\nCouncils\u2019 spending on social care has decreased in recent years\n\nAround \u00a316 billion was spent by councils on providing social care for adults in 2015/16, that\u2019s down 6% in real terms since 2009/10.\n\nThere were 873,000 people over the age of 18 receiving long-term social care provided by local authorities in 2015/16. There were also 245,000 instances of short-term support provided to maximise someone\u2019s independence.\n\nThe number of people over the age of 65 receiving publicly funded social care has decreased by 26% between 2009/10 and 2013/14, according to the King\u2019s Fund. It points out that while part of this change may be down to improvements that mean some people who once would have needed social care are now able to live independently without it, \u201caccess to care had been tightened considerably over the past decade\u201d and the figures for unmet needs suggest that more people should require social care.", "lang": "en"}
