Mga kasangkapang ginamit nila [ay] kabaong, kandila, at picture ni Duterte. Maliwanag pa sa sikat ng araw na ang kanilang ginagawa ay simpleng paraan ng pangkukulam \u2013 (Galacia 5:19-20) This ritual is called witchcraft! Super foul ito.\"\n\nThe photo showed what looked like a burial set up, with people on the street surrounding a gold casket and candles.\n\nThe oldest post of the claim with the same caption was dated October 7, 2018.\n\nThe claim was spotted through the social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle. Since it was posted, it has garnered over 26,000 shares, 10,000 reactions, and 1,503 comments.\n\nThe facts: The photo was taken out of context. A Google reverse image search reveals similar photos taken during a symbolic street theater activity called \"Lamay para sa Demokrasya\" \u2013 part of Coalition for Justice's (CFJ) Dasal at Ayuno faith rally \u2013 at Padre Faura Street in Manila in May 2018.\n\nRappler sent a copy of the photo in the claim to CFJ Lead Convenor Pastor Caloy Di\u00f1o through an email. In a text message, Di\u00f1o denied that the activity was a ritual calling for the President's death.\n\n\"That was a Mass held by Catholic priests. But the people gathered there were from various groups. Also participating was a group of creative artists that placed a coffin near [the Supreme Court] to represent the death of democracy,\" he said.\n\nDi\u00f1o added that \"no ritual was done...but about mourning for the death of democracy.\"", "lang": "en"}
