But the photo has been shared in a misleading way and actually shows a camp in Paris, France.\n\nThe photo was first published in this Facebook post on May 20, 2019, and has been shared more than 3,400 times. It has started to circulate again more widely in Africa, including Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa and Benin.\n\nIt shows people standing in front of dozens of shelters made with wooden boards and plastic sheets on an abandoned railway line.\n\n\u201cTHIS IS LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA,\u201d the caption on the post reads. \u201cAnd they made us to believe that we can only find shanties & slums like this in Africa. This is what they hide from us until you go there and see for urself (sic).\u201d\n\nSimilar claims are made in other Facebook posts, some archived here, here and here.\n\nMany of the comments suggest some Facebook users believed the picture was shot in Los Angeles, while others were sceptical, even dismissive, about the claim.\n\nWhile the photo is real, it was not shot in Los Angeles. It was taken five years ago and shows a slum between the Porte de Clignancourt and the Porte de la Chapelle on the outskirts of Paris.\n\nA reverse image search on Yandex web browser led us to a Daily Mail story published on December 18, 2015, alongside the photo with a watermark for Associated Press (AP) in the bottom left-hand corner. The story reports on the living conditions of Roma communities in the French capital.\n\nAP's archives confirm the photo was taken on the same day by Jacques Brinon.\n\n\u201cRoma stand through their makeshift camp set up next to the Paris ring road, Friday, Dec.18, 2015,\u201d the caption reads. \u201cRoma, mostly from Romania and Bulgaria, are among Europe's most marginalised minorities.\u201d\n\nA similar photograph was taken of the same camp by Florian David for AFP a few months earlier, on September 30, 2015.\n\nUsing Google Street View, AFP Fact Check confirmed that the AP picture was indeed shot in the north of Paris.\n\nSome visible features in the picture such as rail lines and wall paintings match with those seen on Google Street View's historical images of the camp from 2015.", "lang": "en"}
