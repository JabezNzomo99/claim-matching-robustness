No, that's not true: a viral story claiming a shark was spotted there originated on a prank website where it had been uploaded by some joker.

It appears to be run by a Belgian company named Mediavibes or Media Vibes which is managed by a man named Nicolas Gouriou according to registration records.\n\nEach site in the network comes with a disclaimer (sometimes translated into a different language) that reads:\n\nSo don't fall for this prank now that we've warned you about it!\n\nWe wrote about nsfnews.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Urban Meyer NOT Cleared Of All Charges From Panel (Yet?)\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Snakes Released in Hinckley Lake, Did NOT Cause Mass Hysteria\n\u2022 Fake News: Police NOT Looking For Massillon Man Involved in Shooting That Lead To Death of Another Man\n\u2022 Fake News: Red Lobster NOT To Build New Restaurant on Hamilton's Westside", "lang": "en"}
