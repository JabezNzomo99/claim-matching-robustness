The image is being shared in a misleading context; it shows protesters on a different rail line on August 5; the cause of the derailment remains under investigation by Hong Kong's rail authority but there was no immediate suggestion of foul play.\n\nThe image was published here on Facebook on September 17, 2019, the same day a trail derailed near Hung Hom station, Kowloon.\n\nThe accident happened on the East Rail Line during the morning rush hour, leaving eight people injured. The cause of the derailment was under investigation, AFP reported here, but there was no immediate suggestion of foul play.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe image was published in a Facebook group with more than 15,000 members.\n\nThe traditional Chinese language text superimposed on the image translates to English as: \u201cAbsurd! Most hateful.\n\n\u201cThis photo sent to me by my relatives shows it was indeed caused by the black shirts! They are still trying to deny it even after being captured on camera!\n\n\u201cHave they considered the hundreds of lives involved? What else does the MTR need to investigate? It\u2019s definitely them! I really want to swear but I\u2019m not going to as I\u2019m a gentle person\u201d.\n\nBlack t-shirts have become the signature clothing worn by pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, as explained in this AFP report.\n\nThe same image was published here, here and here with a similar claim in Facebook groups with thousands of members.\n\nThe image is being shared in a misleading context; it shows protesters on a different rail line on August 5, 2019.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the same photo published here by Hong Kong news site hk01 in photo gallery. Its traditional Chinese language headline translates to English as \u201cStrikes and rallies August 5\u201d.\n\nThe photo's caption translates to English as: \u201cProtesters in Tin Shui Wai jumped into Light Rail tracks and picked up stones.\u201d\n\nTin Shui Wai is a station in the northwest of Hong Kong on the West Rail Line.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the image in the misleading post (L) and the HK01 image (R):\n\nAlmost 150 people were arrested in Hong Kong on August 5 during a general strike and clashes between police and pro-democracy protesters, AFP reported here on August 6.\n\nOn the MTR railway map shown below, AFP has circled Tin Shui Wai station in northwest Hong Kong, and Hung Hom station, where the derailment on September 17 happened:\n\nGoogle Street View imagery of Tin Shui Wai station shows similar sloped platforms, blue-green fences, as well as crushed stones alongside the railway tracks as seen in the photo in the misleading post.
