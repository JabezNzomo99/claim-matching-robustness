Captain Deepak Vasant Sathe, the pilot in command of the aircraft, and co-pilot Akhilesh Kumar lost their lives along with 16 others. A video now circulating on social media has been shared with the claim that it shows Captain Deepak Sathe singing.\n\nAlt News has received several verification requests for the video on its official mobile application.\n\nThe officer in the video is wearing a naval uniform which was the first clue suggesting that he is not late Captain Deepak Sathe. The officer is singing the song \u2018Ghar Se Nikalte Hi\u2019. A keyword search on YouTube took us to the same video uploaded in March 2019.\n\nAccording to an article in The Quint, \u201cIn a heartwarming rendition of Udit Narayan\u2019s Ghar Se Nikalte Hi, Vice Admiral Girish Luthra (Retd) left the families of the Indian Navy officers smiling\u2026on the special occasion of the Indian Navy celebrating its \u2018Golden Jubilee\u2019 \u2013 50 years \u2013 after being formally established on 1 March 1968.\u201d\n\n\u201cVice Admiral Luthra, who held the position of Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Western Naval Command, retired on 31 January upon superannuation, after dedicating four decades of his life to the Indian Navy. He was in-charge of the Western Naval Command since May 2016,\u201d the report further stated.\n\nTherefore, a video from last year where Vice Admiral Girish Luthra (Retd) is singing to an audience of Naval officers and their families has been falsely shared as Captain Deepak Sathe singing, who passed away in the recent Air India Express crash in Kerala.", "lang": "en"}
