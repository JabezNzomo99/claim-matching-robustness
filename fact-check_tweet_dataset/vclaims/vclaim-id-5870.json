This claim is false. The cages were formerly used by the California Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation (CDCR) and are being recycled by a local business.\n\nExamples of the claim are visible here and here .\n\nOn August 15, video footage showing metal cages stored outdoors appeared online ( here and here ). In the video, two unidentified men can be heard exclaiming that the cages appear to have toilets, and that they \u201care for people\u201d.\n\nOn social media, users have circulated this footage, some including links to a story on the website USSANEWS, claiming that the metal cages are for holding human trafficking victims, or individuals who refuse to be vaccinated against COVID-19 ( here ).\n\nOn August 18, the Fresno County Sheriff\u2019s Office posted a statement on Facebook that the office had received numerous reports of these sightings.\n\n\u201cDetectives were able to identify the location of the cages and determined they were formerly used by the California Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation (CDCR),\u201d the statement said, \u201cto provide a safe and secure area for protective custody inmates to participate in outdoor activities\u201d.\n\nThe statement added that the metal holding cells had been \u201cretired\u201d and acquired by a local metal recycling business, to be \u201crecycled\u201d or \u201crepurposed by local area farmers to protect agricultural supplies and pumps from theft\u201d. ( here ).\n\nThe Sheriff\u2019s Office confirmed in the statement that the holding cells had no connection to human trafficking activity, as implied in posts on social media.\n\nThe press secretary for the CDCR confirmed to Reuters via email that the \u201coutdoor recreation spaces\u201d seen in the footage are \u201cstrictly used for our maximum-security population\u201d.\n\nA report by SFGate showing conditions among death row prisoners in San Quentin, California\u2019s infamous prison, show secure cells very similar to the \u201ccages\u201d in the claims ( here ). CDRC told Reuters the cells pictured were not the ones in these claims, but rather were used in maximum security prisons like Pelican Bay.\n\nFalse. Metal cages in Caruthers, California, were formerly holding cells and are not proof of a human trafficking operation.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
