As far as I\u2019m concerned, that person is not employed because he is not working based on his level of education.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemember, I didn\u2019t say it\u2019s up to 70%, I said it is rising towards 70%,\u201d he said.\n\nThe most recent national data on Nigeria\u2019s employment is a labour\n\nWe were directed to this report by Dr Baba Madu, the head of the national accounts division at the bureau.\n\nThe report covered October 2017 to September 2018. The next set of employment statistics are being prepared and will be published \u201csoon\u201d, Madu said.\n\nWho qualifies as unemployed or underemployed?\n\n\n\n as one who does not have work or only works for less than 20 hours a week. For you to count as being unemployed, you must have previously been in . This means you are between 15 and 64 years of age, are willing and able to work and have actively looked for work in the \u201creference period\u201d or the week preceding the survey. \n\n\n\n how it calculates unemployment, from those working fewer than 40 hours a week \u2013 the threshold for \u201cfull-time\u201d \u2013 to those working less than 20 hours a week.

Those who were underemployed\n\nfrom 18 million to 18.2 million in this period.\n\nThis made the most recent unemployment rate\n\n, a rise from 18.8% in the third quarter of 2017. When both employment and underemployment were considered,\n\nHow many young people are unemployed? Nigeria\u2019s data agency\n\n\u201d as those aged between 15 and 35. For the period when the most recent data is available, the youth unemployment rate rose from 25.5% in the third quarter of 2017\n\n. This is less than Mailafia\u2019s claim of 70%.\n\nIf we are generous\n\nthe most recent underemployment rate of\n\n, the number is 55.4%, which is still significantly lower than Mailafia\u2019s estimate. We therefore rate the claim incorrect.\n\nBut the number of young people who are out of work in Nigeria is still a concern. Prof\n\n, southwestern Nigeria, told Africa Check: \u201cNigeria\u2019s youth unemployment and underemployment figures are worrisome, and they are worsening.\u201d\n\nAlege said there were a number of reasons why so many young people were out of work. These included the education system not teaching the right skills, and advances in technology leading to the loss of certain types of jobs.\n\nis here and\n\nhow we live and work. But Nigeria is not ready. The school curriculum has also not been reviewed to equip students with the skills they need to work in this age.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause of this, young people educated in Nigeria would increasingly have difficulty finding jobs. Attempts made at creating jobs are not enough,\u201d he said.\n\n, in the southwest of the country, said government regulations and taxes made the country seem unfriendly to investors.\n\n\u201cThough it is not proper to approximate 55.4% to 70%, having more than half of a country\u2019s youth population unemployed or underemployed is a bad indicator. If things don\u2019t change drastically, unemployment and underemployment figures would be headed for 70%,\u201d Akinbobola said.\n\nConclusion: Youth unemployment in Nigeria worrying, but not near 70%\n\nWhile criticising a letter from the president, a former deputy governor of Nigeria\u2019s central bank highlighted what he said were dire unemployment figures for young people in the country.\n\nAlmost seven in ten young people were unemployed, Dr\n\ntold a national publication. He told Africa Check he included the underemployed in this statistic.\n\nThe most recent official data on youth unemployment in Nigeria shows that 29.7% of youth were unemployed, and a further 25.7% underemployed. This comes to 55.4%, well short of Mailafia\u2019s figure.\n\nExperts we spoke to said the official figure was still worrying , and could rise.", "lang": "en"}
