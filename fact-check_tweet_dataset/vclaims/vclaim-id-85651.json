In this report, we will investigate advertising agencies with close ties to the BJP handling social media for Maharashtra Election Commission. The story begins with Devang Dave.\n\nDevang Dave is the managing director at Social Central and the founder of Facebook pages \u2018The Fearless Indian\u2019 and \u2018I Support Narendra Modi.\u2019 He is the social media head of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), the youth wing of the BJP. Dave\u2019s profile picture on Twitter is with Prime Minister Modi.\n\nThe address used on CEO Maharashtra\u2019s advertiser details appears on Devang Dave\u2019s website. It is noteworthy that Dave changed the address on his website after Gokhale\u2019s tweets.\n\nThe Election Commission of Maharashtra is a client of Social Central and so is the Ministry of Steel and Maharashtra BJP.\n\nThe company Signpost India also handled social media for Maharashtra Election Commission and Ministry of Steel. This was found through the LinkedIn profile of a former intern at Signpost.\n\nThere are several pictures of BJYM IT cell head Devang Dave that place him inside the office of Signpost India.\n\nAfter it was brought to light that a company that handles social media for the BJP is also managing Maharashtra Election Commission\u2019s online presence, Devang Dave put a statement on Twitter. \u201cThe work assigned by Election Commission to Signpost was after following due process. There is no illegality whatsoever,\u201d he claimed.\n\nWhile Dave has denied any conflict of interest, the URL \u2018isupportnamo.org\u2018 redirects to the website of Signpost India.\n\nDomain \u2018isupportnamo.org\u2019 used to be the corresponding website of Facebook page \u2018I Support Narendra Modi\u2019 (facebook.com/isupportnamo) which has a massive follower count of 16 million. This page was founded by Devang Dave and as the name suggests, regularly posts content favouring PM Modi and the BJP.\n\nOn a web archive link from 2018, we found that Devang Dave\u2019s personal website was hosted on the same server as isupportnamo.org, Signpost India, Social Central, \u2018Fearless Indian\u2019 and several websites of BJP leaders including Nirmala Sitharaman and Poonam Mahajan.\n\nSignpost\u2019s past projects reveal a close association with the BJP. Union Minister Rajnath Singh was photographed at Signpost India\u2019s launch of a Digital India project in 2018. The company had also uploaded pictures of BJP Assam MLA Himanta Biswa inaugurating a project in 2018.\n\nLast year in December, the Ministry of Steel had extended its contract with Signpost India of managing social media presence of the ministry and its ministers.\n\nTherefore, ad agencies with deep ties to a member of BJP IT cell have the Election Commission of Maharashtra, an autonomous constitutional body, as one of their clients. Devang Dave has claimed that Singpost India\u2019s work with CEO Maharashtra is unrelated to his association with the BJP. But the redirection of \u2018isuppprtnamo.org\u2019 to Singpost India\u2019s website and the nature of Signpost India\u2019s clientele shows a conflict of interest.\n\nResponding on the matter, ECI spokesperson said that the commission has sought a detailed factual report from CEO Maharashtra. Former CM Prithviraj Chavhan said that he will address a press conference on July 24 on the matter.", "lang": "en"}
