Ted Strickland tied Sen. Rob Portman to the notorious former president of Haiti, Jean-Claude \"Baby Doc\" Duvalier, during the final Ohio Senate debate.\n\n\"There's only one of the two of us standing before this audience that's ever been a registered lobbyist, and that's you, senator,\" Strickland said. \"Your first job as a lobbyist was with the Chinese-based firm. You were a registered foreign agent, and your client was Haiti, at a time when the Baby Doc, Duvalier, who was a despot, was killing people.\"\n\nAfter losing his re-election bid to Republican Gov. John Kasich, Strickland oversaw the lobbying and activism arm of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, but he was not a lobbyist himself.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Portman, however, was a registered foreign agent, a title that can involve lobbying.\n\nAs PolitiFact Ohio has previously reported, Portman started working with the law firm Patton, Boggs & Blow after graduating from University of Michigan's law school in 1984.\n\nThe Strickland campaign sent us a Buzzfeed article showing Portman\u2019s 1985 foreign agent registration form. He was listed as a foreign agent on behalf of the Republic of Haiti, which was ruled by Duvalier at the time.\n\nDuvalier, who inherited the \"president for life\" post from his father, \"Papa Doc,\" headed what human rights workers called one of the most oppressive governments in the Western Hemisphere, according to the New York Times. His regime, known for the murder and torture of of tens of thousands, was toppled in 1986.\n\nBut it\u2019s not entirely fair to imply that Portman was Duvalier\u2019s lackey. He never lobbied on behalf of Haiti or any other foreign government.\n\nIn 2005, Portman was named by President George W. Bush as his U.S. Trade Representative, a position that can\u2019t be held by anyone who\u2019s ever lobbied for foreign governments.\n\nBeing tapped for the position prompted an affidavit from Stuart Pape, a former managing partner of Portman's law firm dated April 12, 2005. Pape said Portman filed the foreign agent registration form because he was working for the Hong Kong-based Duty Free Shoppers, Ltd., the \"Chinese-based firm\" Strickland referred to.\n\nBut Pape said he reviewed the records and confirmed that Portman did no work for Haiti or any foreign government.\n\nOn Portman\u2019s campaign website, the Haiti registration is explained as \"standard procedure\" at the lobbying firm, and required of all of its attorneys. The firm, the record shows, did travel to Haiti to meet with Baby Doc.\n\nStrickland said of Portman, \"You were a registered foreign agent, and your client was Haiti, at a time when the Baby Doc, Duvalier, who was a despot, was killing people.\"\n\nPortman was a registered foreign agent who worked on behalf of a company based in Hong Kong. His firm\u2019s clients included \"Baby Doc\" Duvalier\u2019s government. But Portman himself did no work for the Haitian regime, according to a sworn statement by the firm\u2019s managing partner.\n\nCorrection: The original version of this fact-check incorrectly called Rob Portman a registered lobbyist. He was a registered foreign agent, a classification that included lobbying under the law at that time.", "lang": "en"}
