He made no mention of Japan fighting off China.\n\nThe Philippine envoy, who spoke at a news conference ahead of an international forum in the Japanese capital on May 31 last year, said it was in Tokyo\u2019s interests to keep shipping lanes open in the South China Sea, where its commercial ships pass.\n\nThe South China Sea is being contested by China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Brunei, Vietnam and the Philippines.\n\nPH TV\u2019s report, which could have reached over 4.3 million people, was misleadingly uploaded on March 21, nearly 10 months after Laurel made his statement. It resurfaced on social media a second time after netizens re-shared it in May.\n\nThe content of PH TV\u2019s inaccurate report was a series of clips showing military ships sailing at sea, and an inset of an unidentified man wearing a mask, reading as his script the Philippine Star article translated into Filipino,\n\nThe video\u2019s thumbnail shows a Japanese ship called the JS KAGA (DDH 184) from the Japanese Ministry of Defense, during a bilateral maritime exercise between Japan and the United States on August 30, 2018 in the South China Sea. It was photoshopped with an image of fighter jets and a photo of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nThe misleading YouTube upload was re-shared on Facebook this May by netizens around the same time the Palace released a statement on May 27 saying the country, along with Vietnam, has reaffirmed its commitment to the \u201cpeaceful settlement of disputes\u201d in the South China Sea.", "lang": "en"}
