Among those, the president specifically mentioned water losses in municipalities.\n\n\u201cIn an effort to curb high water losses, which in some municipalities far exceed the national average, which is currently at 37%; about 10,000 unemployed youth are being trained as plumbers, artisans and water agents,\u201d Zuma held.\n\nAfrica Check has already investigated the second part of that statement\n\nof the 2017 State of the Nation Address.\n\nBut what exactly is the state of water losses in our municipalities? We set out looking for data.\n\n\u2019s spokesman, Sputnik Ratau, told Africa Check that he wasn\u2019t able to tell us which municipalities exceeded the national average\n\nThe national average for municipal water losses was established in a 2012\n\nIn official reports, water losses are called \u201c\n\n\u201d. This refers to water that a municipality doesn\u2019t generate income from. It includes water that is lost through physical leaks, commercial losses along with the authorised consumption of water that isn\u2019t billed for.\n\nTo estimate the average water lost by municipalities the firm looked at data collected from\n\nout of 237 municipalities at the time. They calculated how much water a municipality received and how much was billed for (the water flow patterns) recorded it in a\n\nTo produce this balance sheet, WRP collected information from\n\n, the then department of water affairs\u2019\n\n. The balance sheet was then emailed to various water service authority managers who were required to fill any gaps and rectify mistakes.\n\nFrom this analysis, the firm estimated that the average share of water lost by the 132 municipalities studied was\n\n. Physical leaks made up 25.4% of the non-revenue water.\n\nCollecting the data raised concerns regarding the\n\n. Only 45 municipalities (19%) had complete records that were deemed of good quality.\n\nThis observation is echoed in the\n\nwhich the water services director for the\n\nthat \u201cdespite many municipalities noting that they have a water shortage problem, many of these municipalities have a very limited knowledge of their water use and associated water losses\u201d.\n\nSo what is the current state of South Africa\u2019s municipal water losses?\n\nData too unreliable for Stats SA to publish\n\nCelia Mamabolo from the local government division at Statistics South Africa provided Africa Check with municipal-reported data on the number of water units they bought from water boards and other service providers, together with water they received from their own water sources. She also provided Africa Check with data on water units municipalities lost in distribution.\n\nMamabolo cautioned that this \u201cdata is not published and has limitations to it. Most municipalities do not keep records of their water statistics.\u201d\n\nOnly 3% of municipalities responded to the questions about water supply and loss, Mamabolo told Africa Check. This data is therefore too unreliable to publish, she added.\n\nA good example is the data the\n\nprovided for the 2014/2015 financial year. It shows an estimated water supply of 105,807,911 kiloliters, of which 85,723,303 kiloliters were estimated to be lost. This would mean close to 81% of the metro\u2019s water was lost in that financial year.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to the water loss reported in the\n\n, which was listed as 23.33%.\n\nAfrica Check tried to access a final possible source of data, municipalities\u2019 water services development plans.\n\nIn accordance with the\n\n, municipalities are to produce these plans on an annual basis and they should be made available to the public at request. They are meant to outline\n\nAfrica Check tried to get access to these plans through the department of water and sanitation, but our request was still being processed at the time of publication. (\n\nEven so, \u201cquite often the required information like water meter data is missing\u201d, an associate professor in the\n\nMany municipalities therefore cannot provide values for their water losses in their water services development plans.\n\nConclusion: No conclusive data available on how much water SA municipalities lose\n\nData on municipal water loss is hard to find. A specially commissioned study in 2012 found that the share of water lost back then ran at an average of 37%.\n\nAfrica Check searched high and low for current figures. We consulted the South African Local Government Association, Statistics South Africa and tried to access the water services development plans municipalities are meant to produce annually and make publically available.\n\nThese sources point to inadequate record-keeping by South African municipalities. Given that the institutions themselves don\u2019t seem to know how much water they are losing, we have to rate the claim that many municipalities exceed the national water loss average of 37% as unproven.\n\nMunicipal water records too unreliableA child in Alexandra picks up a book lying in the water flowing from a blocked drain in February 2007.
