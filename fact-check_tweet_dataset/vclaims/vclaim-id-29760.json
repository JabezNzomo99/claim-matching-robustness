The posts were published after a new citizenship law was introduced in India in August 2019. The claim is false; the video has circulated online for almost one year in Sri Lankan media reports about abuse at a Sri Lankan prison.\n\nThe video was published in this Facebook post on December 28, 2019.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption states: \u201cMuslims are in gulags (detention camps) in Assam. May Allah protect all of them - Ameen Ya Rab.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nAssam is a state in northeast India. It is the first Indian state to have introduced a new National Register of Citizens (NRC).\n\nSome two million people in Assam were left off the new register after they were deemed unable to prove their Indian citizenship, prompting criticism from the United Nations. Here is an AFP report about the issue.\n\nIndia\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has denied there are any plans to detain people over the new citizenship law.\n\nBut local media reports and opposition politicians including Congress\u2019 Rahul Gandhi, have said the move unfairly targets Assam\u2019s Muslim population and that people left off the register might be held in detention camps.\n\nGandhi tweeted a BBC video report about the issue on December 26 alongside a Hindi-language caption that translates to English as: \"RSS\u2019 prime minister is lying to mother India.\" His tweet has been embedded below.\n\nThe six-minute and 14-second long video has been also shared here, here, here and here on Facebook and here, here and here on YouTube alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the video has circulated online for months prior to Assam releasing the final NRC lists and has been widely used in reports about abuse at a prison in the southern Sri Lankan town of Angunakolapelessa.\n\nA time and date stamp is visible on the top-left corner of the video and a red logo with \u2018TRUTHLANKA.COM\u2019 written on it can be seen on the top-right corner of the video screen.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the footage, with the stamp and logo highlighted in yellow by AFP:\n\nAn online search found this Facebook page with the same name and logo.\n\nThe same video was published here in a post on the Truth Lanka Facebook page on January 16, 2019.\n\nThe Sinhala-language caption translates to English as: \u201cCCTV footage of inhuman assault on Angunakolapelessa prison inmates.\u201d\n\nA longer version of the video was published here on YouTube by a local news website on the same day.\n\nThe video\u2019s description states: \u201cFootage found in several security cameras have now been released to the media. This assault occurred on November 22, 2018. However, issuing a special statement on the matter, the Justice and Prisons Reforms Ministry points out that a three member committee has been appointed to inquire into the assault and the committee report has been made a top priority by the Justice Minister. She has also noted that any action in the future on the matter will be decided upon studying the committee findings.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison from the video posted in the misleading Facebook post (L) and YouTube video (R):\n\nScreenshots from the video were included in multiple Sri Lankan media reports on the prison abuse at the time, including this report published by Sri Lanka's Daily Mirror newspaper on January 16, 2019 and this report published by Sri Lanka's Sunday Observer on January 20, 2019.", "lang": "en"}
