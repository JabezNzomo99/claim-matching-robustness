But while efforts to pass sanctions in the U.S. have hit domestic hurdles, the sanctions themselves were drafted in reaction to Moscow\u2019s international acts.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "February 17, 2019", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-42211", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/medvedev-sanctions-from-hell-fact-check/29772721.html", "vclaim": "Speaking on Thursday, February 15, at the Russian Investment Forum in Sochi Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev called U.S. lawmakers\u2019 latest attempts to sanction Russia \u201cjust another schizoid story.\u201d\n\nMedvedev said that while the sanctions would affect Russia\u2019s economy, they would not cause \u201cany substantial damage,\u201d adding Russia would continue to follow its path. He said, however, that sanctions are not helpful because \u201cthey slow down growth.\u201d\n\n\u200bRegarding the motivation behind the latest U.S. measures, Medvedev said they were not connected to bilateral relations, but rather a byproduct of \u201cdomestic problems in the United States.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, February 13, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, backed by members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, introduced an even tougher version of the so-called \u201csanctions from hell bill\u201d that failed to pass last year.\n\nThe reintroduction of the Defending American Security from Kremlin Aggression Act targets Russia for interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and military intervention in Ukraine.\n\nBroadly speaking, the bill seeks \u201cto strengthen the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), to combat international cybercrime, and to impose additional sanctions with respect to the Russian Federation.\u201d\n\nUnder the bill, U.S. persons would be prohibited from \u201cengaging in transactions with, providing financing, or in any other way dealing in Russian sovereign debt.\u201d The bill would also prohibit \u201ctransactions in all property and interests in property\u201d in a number of Russian financial institutions for their interference in foreign elections.\n\nThe targeted banks include Vnesheconombank, Sberbank, VTB Bank, Gazprombank, Bank of Moscow, Rosselkhozbank and Promsvyazbank.\n\nThe ban on dealing in Russian sovereign debt also covers bonds issued by Russia\u2019s Central Bank, National Wealth Fund and the Federal Treasury of the Russian Federation, along with \u201cagents or affiliates of any of those entities.\u201d Foreign exchange swap agreements with those institutions will also be prohibited.\n\nThe bill also targets Russia\u2019s cyber sector, individuals deemed to \u201cfacilitate illicit and corrupt activities, directly or indirectly, on behalf of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin\u201d and the country\u2019s oil and gas sector. Specifically, it bars the provision of goods, services, technology, financing or support that could \u201cdirectly and significantly contribute to\u201d the development or production of crude oil resources in the Russian Federation.\u201d\n\nThe bill would require an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Senate to withdraw from NATO. It addresses Russia\u2019s \u201cabuse and misuse\" of INTERPOL\u2019s red notices, orders a determination of whether Russia meets the criteria for designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, extends limitations on imports of uranium form Russia and establishes a \u201cNational Fusion Center\u201d to counter hybrid threats posed by the Russian government.\n\nThe bill also seeks to compel U.S. President Donald Trump to \u201cpublicly call for\u201d Russia to return the Crimean peninsula to Ukraine, to end its support for separatist violence in eastern Ukraine, to end its occupation of, and support for, separatists on the territory of Georgia and Moldova, and \u201ccease enabling the brutal regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria to commit war crimes. It further calls on Trump to \u201cunequivocally condemn and counter the ongoing interference in United States institutions and democratic processes by the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, his government, and affiliates of his government.\"\n\nMenendez said the sanctions bill was reintroduced because Congress had reached a \"boiling point\" on Trump's \"willful paralysis in the face of Kremlin aggression,\u201d The Hill reported.\n\n\"We are introducing a proposal to actually address the realities of the Kremlin threat in a holistic way, all while sending a crystal clear message to our adversaries that the U.S Congress will protect our institutions, allies and values even if the President chooses not to do so,\u201d Menendez said.\n\nThe reintroduction of the bill comes as the U.S. State Department has been accused of passing the buck on its congressionally-mandated obligation to hold Russia accountable for the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, England on March 4, 2018.\n\nDemocratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, also on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN: \u201cToo often, the Trump administration resorts to foot dragging when it comes to holding foreign powers accountable, particularly Russia.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThe Kremlin used a nerve agent on NATO soil \u2014 it's hard to overstate how brazen this behavior is. There's overwhelming bipartisan agreement that the Kremlin should pay a heavy price and the law is crystal clear in this respect. It's time for some follow through.\"\n\nIt is worth noting that the sanctions bill's main sponsorship is bipartisan. The Republican who introduced the measure, Sen. Lindsey Graham, is often seen as aligned with Trump's policies, and also enjoys praise from the president.\n\nIn an Oval Office interview with a group of reporters in early February, President Trump reportedly confirmed Graham's influence, referring to Graham as among, \"People I respect, I listen to.\"\n\nWhile Medvedev is correct that the implementation of sanctions against Russia has been subject to the vagaries of domestic U.S. politics, to state that they are purely a result of politics, and not Russian actions on the global stage, is false.", "lang": "en"}
