That\u2019s an increase of 1.2 million. These 4.5 million households contain over 11 million people.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what exactly Labour means when it says these people are \u201cat the sharp end of the housing crisis\u201d, but it could be taken to mean that they struggle to afford housing and live in poor quality housing.\n\n29% of people renting from a private landlord, and not receiving housing benefit which covers the entirety of their rent, say that it is difficult to pay the rent. 17% of households in the private rented sector have a health and safety hazard severe enough that a local council is required to take action when they become aware of it. The most common types of this sort of hazard are excess cold and fall hazards.", "lang": "en"}
