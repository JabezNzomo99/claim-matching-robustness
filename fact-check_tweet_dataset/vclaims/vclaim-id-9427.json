Some $40 billion has been spent on developing the project, which is supposed to prevent ballistic missiles from attacking the homeland.\n\nFor instance, in March 2011, then-MDA Director Lt. Gen. Patrick O\u2019Reilly told Congress: \u201cDue to the number of interceptors . . . we have, the probability will be well in the high-90s today of the GMD system being able to intercept [a missile] today.\u201d\n\nThere are 36 interceptors in place, so if more than nine ballistic missiles were launched at once, the number of available interceptors per missile would be less than four.\n\nThe interceptor system has been tested 18 times since 1999, with a success rate of about 56 percent. The most recent test, on May 30, 2017, was a success, but the three of four before that failed. It\u2019s worth noting that the tests are done under ideal conditions \u2014 during the day, not at night, and without having to deal with an adversary\u2019s countermeasures, such as decoy warheads or technology that confuses the interceptors.\n\n\u201cI think this reasoning is flawed,\u201d said James M. Acton, co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cIt assumes that the failure modes of the interceptors are independent of one another. But, in practice, if one interceptor fails because of a design flaw, say, it\u2019s much more likely that others will do so too for the same reason.\u201d\n\nActon offered a compelling analogy. Suppose a family of four showed up at a hospital with the same illness. A doctor treated the first patient with antibiotics that had a 60 percent chance of working. If the antibiotic does not work, then the chances of success actually decline with the next patient; unlike a coin toss, the potential success rate don\u2019t increase.\n\nSimilarly, the Operational Test and Evaluation Office of the secretary of defense has been deeply skeptical, warning in its 2016 annual report that \u201cGMD demonstrates a limited capability to defend the U.S. Homeland from small numbers of simple intermediate-range or intercontinental ballistic missile threats launched from North Korea or Iran.\u201d The report added that the \u201creliability and availability of the operational [interceptors] are low.\u201d\n\nThe president speaks with confidence but descends into hyperbole. No single interceptor for ICBMs has demonstrated a 97-percent success rate, and there is no guarantee using two interceptors has a 100-percent success rate. Moreover, the military\u2019s suggestion that it could achieve a 97-percent success rate with four interceptors appears based on faulty assumptions and overenthusiastic math. The odds of success under the most ideal conditions are no better than 50-50, and likely worse, as documented in detailed government assessments.", "lang": "en"}
