Donald Trump: What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate. But we\u2019re getting them out of our country, they\u2019re here illegally. After the border is secured and after everything gets normalized, we\u2019re going to make a determination on the people that you\u2019re talking about who are terrific people. \u2026\n\nTrump made a similar claim in an Aug. 31 speech in Arizona just hours after meeting with the president of Mexico. At that time, Trump said there are \u201cat least 2 million \u2026 criminal aliens now inside of our country,\u201d citing \u201cfederal data.\u201d\n\nIt is true that a fiscal year 2013 Department of Homeland Security report says: \u201cICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] estimates that 1.9 million removable criminal aliens are in the United States today.\u201d\n\nBut not all of those \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d live in the U.S. illegally. The term refers to any noncitizen \u2014 whether in the U.S. legally or illegally \u2014 who has ever been convicted of a crime in the United States, according to a Sept. 8, 2016, report by the Congressional Research Service. \u201cCriminal aliens\u201d include legal permanent residents, also known as green card holders, and those living in the U.S. legally on temporary visas who have committed a crime in the U.S.\n\nThe ICE report did not say how many of the 1.9 million \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d are living in the U.S. illegally, and neither did the CRS report. However, the Migration Policy Institute says that most of them are here legally.\n\nIn a July 2015 report, the Migration Policy Institute estimated that 820,000 of the 1.9 million are living in the U.S. illegally. Most of those 820,000 people \u2014 about 690,000 \u2014 have been convicted of a felony or serious misdemeanor that would make them targets for removal under policies adopted by the Obama administration in 2014. (See page 25 of the report.)\n\nBy that measure, most of the 1.9 million \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d came to the U.S. legally via green cards and visas \u2014 not by illegally crossing the southern border.", "lang": "en"}
