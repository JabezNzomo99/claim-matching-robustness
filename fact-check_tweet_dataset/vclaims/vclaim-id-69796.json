Trident\u2019s official distributor in Pakistan said all legitimately imported Trident chewing gum was halal certified. A regional halal product certification body said they had not declared Trident haram.\n\nA report posted on the website of the Daily Pakistan newspaper was headlined: \u201cSpit it out now! Trident gum contain pork, declared haram.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is very likely that Trident is haram. The popular chewing gum made by Mondelez International is \u2018not certified halal\u2019,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe report cites a purported email exchange between the company and a customer. It does not give the time, date, or full names of those involved in the exchange.\n\n\u201cPork gelatin is used in the manufacturing process,\u201d the report said, quoting a response by \u201cCustomer Relations\u201d to a customer identified only as \"Lazeena\".\n\nThe story had been widely shared including by an account with some 19 million followers, according to CrowdTangle data.\n\nMondelez Pakistan said on it\u2019s official Facebook page that all their products were halal certified.\n\n\u201cAll products that are officially distributed by Mondelez Pakistan are certified Halal,\u201d it said, adding that the gum was manufactured in Egypt and Turkey.\n\nOther Trident chewing gum products available in Pakistan may have been imported through unofficial channels from other regions and could have different ingredients, the company said.\n\n\u201cOfficial products have the Halal stamp with Mondelez Pakistan mentioned on the packaging,\u201d Mondelez Pakistan said.\n\nAn official at the Punjab Halal Development Agency -- a halal certification board in Pakistan -- said that they had not declared Trident haram.\n\n\"We believe in the certification of other Islamic countries. If people are buying gum or any other imported product in the market they should look for halal certification and only buy those products,\u201d Dr Saeed Akhtar, Senior Sharia Advisor at the agency, told AFP.\n\n\u201cBecause other products, for instance gum, use gelatin in the manufacturing process and sometime this gelatin is made from haram animals,\u201d he added.\n\nThe photograph used to illustrate the Daily Pakistan report is an image of a bearded Muslim cleric which has been widely used as a meme online.\n\nAn almost identical version of the Daily Pakistan's Trident chewing gum story first ran in 2016 in the Parhlo online newspaper with the headline: \"This Major Imported Chewing Gum Brand May Not Be Halal!\"", "lang": "en"}
