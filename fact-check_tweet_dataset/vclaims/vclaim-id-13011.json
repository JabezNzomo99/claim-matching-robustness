He said it was unwise to attempt to predict the future of the British economy (and in particular the effects of falling back to default World Trade Organisation arrangements) without knowing what that strategy would be.\n\nMr Davis talked about implementation of electronic, speedy border checks for \u201ctrusted traders\u201d to encourage easy cross border trade as an example of what he meant by mitigation.\n\nHe also said, \u201cI have a fairly clear view of how it will work out. I just do not quantify it yet. We will give a quantification later on, but it is quite plain how it will work out.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
