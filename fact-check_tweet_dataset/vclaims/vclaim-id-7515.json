They take people from a lottery where you can imagine these countries are not putting their finest in that lottery.\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s Pants on Fire. Trump again mischaracterizes the diversity visa program that lets in about 50,000 immigrants per fiscal year.\n\nCountries do not send immigrants; individual make the decision to apply for the lottery, and simply applying doesn\u2019t guarantee they\u2019ll come to the United States.\n\nApplicants must meet work or education requirements and be thoroughly vetted by the U.S. State Department before their arrival.\n\n\u2018You look at what's going on where somebody comes in who's bad, and yet they'll have 24 members of a family, not one of them do you want in this country.\u2019\n\nTrump revived an earlier False claim that \"22 to 24 people\" came to the United States due to family ties with the suspect in an October 2017 New York City terror attack.\n\nNeither the White House nor the Department of Homeland Security have provided information to substantiate Trump\u2019s claims. Immigration experts previously told us Trump\u2019s \"chain migration\" numbers are unlikely, particularly because there are limitations on who can be sponsored for immigration.\n\nA 2013 study found that overall, each new immigrant sponsored an average of 3.45 family members.\n\n\u2018You catch them, even if you know they are a criminal, you catch them, you have to release them, by law. You have to release them.\u2019\n\nTrump leaves out important context. \"Catch and release\" is not a law, but a practice generally used in cases dealing with unaccompanied minors and asylum seekers. It is not reserved for criminals.\n\nSome immigrants who have been apprehended or who presented themselves at the border are released into the country with the expectation that they will come back before an immigration judge.\n\nIn a February 2017 memo, then-Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly (now White House chief of staff) said detention of all immigrants may not be possible due to limited detention space.\n\n\"Detention resources should be prioritized based upon potential danger and risk of flight if an individual alien is not detained, and parole determinations will be made in accordance with current regulations and guidance,\" Kelly said.\n\n\u2018We have the worst immigration laws in the entire world by far. Other countries laugh at us, and it\u2019s because of the Democrats. It\u2019s because of Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi.\u2019\n\nTrump consistently has criticized U.S. immigration laws and has called them \"pathetic\" compared to Mexico\u2019s policies. But we\u2019ve found that Trump underplays the increasing robustness of U.S. immigration laws and enforcement, and also has downplayed Mexico\u2019s own porous southern border. We rated that off-base comparison between the United States and Mexico as Mostly False.\n\nTrump has also falsely claimed that the \"catch-and-release\" practice stems from Democrats. It dates back to at least Republican President George W. Bush, and continues under Trump\u2019s Republican leadership.\n\nOn MS-13 gang members: \u2018We are bringing them out by the thousands\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s Mostly False. Immigration officials say they don\u2019t have a count of how many MS-13 gang members have been deported, since they don\u2019t break down deportation data by gang affiliation.\n\nWhile thousands of gang members have been deported under Trump\u2019s administration, there\u2019s no number indicating they all belonged to MS-13. Law enforcement officials estimate there are about 10,000 MS-13 gang members in the United States. The membership includes U.S. citizens who can\u2019t be deported.\n\n\u2018The Democrats are sticking up for MS-13, you heard Nancy Pelosi the other day, like trying to find all sorts of reasons why they should be able to stay\u2019\n\nTrump repeats his False claim about House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi coming out in favor of MS-13 gang members and defending them.\n\nThe claim stems from Pelosi\u2019s criticism of Trump for using the word \"animals\" during an immigration meeting with California officials. Trump used that term after a sheriff spoke about MS-13 gang members.\n\nA day after Trump\u2019s comment, Pelosi said \"calling people animals is not a good thing\" and defended \"undocumented immigrants.\" She did not bring up MS-13 gang members in her comments.\n\n\u2018We do have $1.6 billion, as you know we started the wall.\u2019\n\nThis is disingenuous and Mostly False. Congress appropriated $1.6 billion to replace existing border fencing and add some new barriers. But the money cannot be used to build any of the wall prototypes built under Trump\u2019s directive.\n\nWhile there are border security improvements underway, Trump\u2019s promised border wall is not under construction.\n\nIllegal crossing over \u2018the border is down over 40 percent.\u2019\n\nThis is False. Even though Trump and Vice President Mike Pence say illegal border crossings are down 40 percent, official data does not support their claim.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection numbers shows that southwest border apprehensions increased from March to April of 2018; and the data for April 2018 is also higher than that of April of 2017 and 2016.\n\nBased on the most recent data, it\u2019s unclear how Trump or Pence arrive at a 40 percent decline (and Trump has simultaneously bemoaned a recent rise in apprehensions).", "lang": "en"}
