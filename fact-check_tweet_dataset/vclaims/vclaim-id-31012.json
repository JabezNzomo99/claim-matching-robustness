(Hillary Clinton received nearly ten times as much in Darden-related campaign contributions in 2016 than Donald Trump did.)\n\nDarden does not appear to be operating any political action committees (PACs), and all in all, Darden-related political contributions in 2018 were about evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats. The top three donation recipients were GOPAC, (a Republican state and local political training organization), Republican Senator Rick Scott of Florida, and the Democratic Lieutenant Governors Association.", "lang": "en"}
