Presently, the CoSC consists of all three service chiefs, with the chairman being the senior-most among them. The chairmanship of the CoSC ceases with chairperson's retirement. The permanent chairmanship of the CDS is expected to ensure continuity in joint military decisions.\n\nHowever, the CDS will not have military command. All three service chiefs would still advice the government on matters concerning exclusive to their service.\n\n5. Which other countries have a post equal to the CDS?\n\nAll major armies around the world have a CDS, or a post equivalent to it.\n\u2022 In the United States, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the principle military advisor to the President, the Defence Secretary and to the National Security Council.\n\u2022 In Russia, the Chief of General Staff is the commander of the Armed Forces, and reports to the President and to the Defence Minister.\n\u2022 In China, the post of Chief of Joint Staff was a position created by President Xi Jingping in 2016 as a part of his military reforms, and heads the Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission.\n\u2022 In the United Kingdom, a CDS similarly advices the Prime Minister as a singular point of contact. \n\n\n\nThe PIB release can be read here.", "lang": "en"}
