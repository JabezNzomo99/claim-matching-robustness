In the column, she argued for legislation that would have established a conscience clause for pharmacists, permitting them to deny prescriptions written by doctors for patients. (Her column was paired with one arguing against the measure.) The measure did not pass.\n\nPharmacists have been fired and disciplined for exercising the belief, which can be scientifically supported, that contraceptives may cause the death of a conceived, unborn child by preventing implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus. A bill has been introduced in Wisconsin to protect pharmacists from employment discrimination and disciplinary action based upon their refusal to dispense drugs that would be used to cause an abortion. Proponents of \u201cchoice\u201d oppose such conscience clauses because they interfere with the elevation of women\u2019s convenience over pharmacists\u2019 objections to being a party to murder\u2026. We entrust women \u2014 \u00ad even minors \u2014 with the decisions to conceive, take contraceptives and abort their unborn children. It is certainly reasonable to expect women to plan for obtaining contraceptives from another pharmacy, the nearest Planned Parenthood or an emergency room. Notably, patients do not have the right to demand abortions, sterilizations or euthanasia from Roman Catholic or other morally guided hospitals or providers. The law protects women who choose to terminate pregnancy by chemical means. The law protects doctors who choose to facilitate the termination of life by chemical means. The law certainly should protect pharmacists who choose not to be a party to the morally abhorrent termination of life. Hypocritically, \u201cpro-\u00adchoice\u201d advocates are rather anti-\u00adchoice on this issue.\n\nSaying that the birth-control pill may lead to an abortion is controversial even within the Pro-Life movement. The website of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists actually has dueling position papers on the subject, with some members saying the pill is not an abortifacient and other members arguing that it is one.\n\nOf course, there are birth-control methods that clearly never affect a fertilized egg, such as male and female condoms, diaphragms and cervical caps. These are barriers that prevent the sperm from ever reaching the egg. Pro-Life Wisconsin, on its website, says it is opposed to all forms of artificial contraception. But 15 percent of Catholic women between the ages of 15 and 44 at risk of getting pregnant report using a condom, according to a 2011 survey by the Guttmacher Institute, which favors abortion rights. (Another 31 percent use the birth-control pill, and 5 percent use an IUD.)\n\nBradley\u2019s campaign did not respond to a query about her column. But there\u2019s no indication in it that she was opposed to all forms of birth control, particularly because she writes that \u201cit is certainly reasonable to expect women to plan for obtaining contraceptives from another pharmacy, the nearest Planned Parenthood or an emergency room.\u201d Rather, she argues on behalf of pharmacists who were morally opposed to chemical ways of inducing abortion, in contrast to surgical abortion in hospitals.\n\nBut Bradley is not writing about all forms of birth control, as Clinton suggests (\u201cbirth control, which millions of women use every year\u201d) nor does Bradley specifically write that women using birth control are a \u201cparty to murder.\u201d Indeed, Bradley writes that \u201cit is certainly reasonable to expect women to plan for obtaining contraceptives from another pharmacy, the nearest Planned Parenthood or an emergency room.\u201d If Bradley actually believed all birth control was tantamount to murder, as Clinton claims, then it\u2019s doubtful she would find obtaining contraceptives from another location so reasonable.", "lang": "en"}
