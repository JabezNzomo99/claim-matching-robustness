Is it me or during his speech today a decoy \u201cstood in\u201d for Melania?? Why would the moron say \u201cmy wife, Melania, who happens to be right here\u2026\u201d\n\nA video purportedly showing this \u201cfake\u201d Melania Trump was also widely circulated on social media. As of this writing, Barton\u2019s post has racked up more than 9 million views:\n\nThe evidence provided above is flimsy at best. In fact, it appears that the conspiracy theorists pushing this rumor purposely used a blurry (and possibly distorted) video of Melania Trump in order to make this claim seem more plausible.\n\nThe footage above was captured by filming a television screen showing a CNN report from 13 October 2017. When compared to the actual video available on CNN\u2018s web site, it\u2019s apparent that the strange visual was caused by the TV screen and not a faux first lady.\n\nHere\u2019s a screenshot from the Facebook video (left) compared to a still from the video available on CNN.com. Note that Melania\u2019s face is slightly shrunken, distorted, and rounder in the Facebook video:\n\nThis not evidence of a body double. It\u2019s evidence of a poorly working television.\n\nSeveral other images of the first lady from the same day are also available from news organizations such as Getty Images and the Associated Press. Many of those photographs, such as the following image from the White House, featured the first lady sans sunglasses, clearly showing that this woman is in fact Melania Trump and not some impostor:\n\nThe \u201cMelania body double\u201d rumor came back for second lap around the track in July 2018, as pictures of President Trump and the first lady while they were in Brussels for the NATO Summit showed the president accompanied by a woman who seemingly resembled, but did not look exactly like, Melania:\n\nThe #FakeMelania \u201cbody double\u201d rumor took another lap around the track in March 2019 when the First Couple made a trip to Alabama to survey tornado damage:\n\nHosts of \u201cThe View\u201d commented on how the woman at Trump\u2019s side in photos of the trip appeared shorter than usual and had a different facial structure than the first lady\u2019s. One host allowed that the first lady might have been wearing flat shoes. In fact, the 5-foot-11 first lady had ditched her customary stilettos for sneakers to walk around the rough terrain with the 6-foot-3 Trump.", "lang": "en"}
