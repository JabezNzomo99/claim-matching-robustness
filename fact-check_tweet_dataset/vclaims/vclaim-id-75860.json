The rhetoric coming out of his White House certainly supports that notion.\n\nOn April 26, Obama included this passage in his :\n\n\"Right now, there\u2019s a bill that would boost America\u2019s minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. That would lift wages for nearly 28 million Americans across the country. 28 million. And we\u2019re not just talking about young people on their first job. The average minimum wage worker is 35 years old. They work hard, often in physically demanding jobs.\"\n\nIt\u2019s pretty transparent that Obama is seeking to counter the notion that a wage hike would simply help teenagers taking a summer job or college students making some extra money slinging hash at the local diner.\n\nBut is Obama's specific claim that, \"The average minimum wage worker is 35 years old\" accurate?\n\nThe White House told us it used a by the Economic Policy Institute. This is a liberal group that\u2019s in tune with many of Obama\u2019s policies, but for the moment, let\u2019s put that aside.\n\nThe study looked at anyone earning less than $10.10 an hour, under the logic that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 wouldn\u2019t just raise wages for those earning $7.25 an hour, but rather for everybody earning less than $10.10.\n\nIn addition, David Cooper, the author of the report, told PolitiFact that his calculations actually included everyone currently earning up to $11.10 -- a dollar more than Obama\u2019s proposed minimum wage level. This decision was made on the assumption that anyone earning slightly above $10.10 at the time of the minimum-wage hike would also get a small boost, in order to keep them nestled correctly in a company\u2019s wage hierarchy.\n\nEPI found that the average age of workers earning under $11.10 is 35 years old.\n\nIf you don\u2019t read Obama\u2019s sentence closely, it would seem that he\u2019s right. But actually, he muffed the talking point.\n\nWhereas EPI\u2019s study looked at workers who earned as much as four dollars an hour more than the federal minimum wage, Obama\u2019s words referred to people who are actually being paid the minimum wage today.\n\nWe ran this by Cooper, the report\u2019s author. He told PolitiFact that if you look at workers \"at or near their effective state minimum wage,\" which he defined as within 3 percent of the minimum-wage level, the average age is 31.\n\nThat's in the ballpark but lower than the 35-year-old figure Obama cited.\n\nIn reality, the statistics on this specific point are murky. A different by the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that 71 percent of minimum-wage workers are younger than 30 -- a starkly different picture of low-wage workers. But the BLS study has an important limitation -- it looked only at workers making exactly the federal minimum wage of $7.25 and below, so it doesn\u2019t include workers from any of the 21 states and the District of Columbia that have enacted higher state minimum wages.\n\nA few weeks earlier, the White House used the same EPI statistic correctly. In a tweet, White House spokesman Jay Carney touted an infographic that asked, among other things, \"Who will raising the minimum wage actually help? \u2026 More than half work full-time. The average worker is 35 years old.\"\n\nCarney\u2019s claim focused on workers who will benefit from a wage hike, which is in line with what the study looked at. We rated that statement , in part because the infographic ignored the different conclusion of the BLS study and relied only on one report from a friendly group.\n\nThis time, by contrast, Obama didn\u2019t cite the correct number.\n\nThe White House had a point earlier this month when it tweeted that those who would benefit from a $10.10 wage hike average 35 years of age. But Obama\u2019s subsequent comment was less accurate. In his weekly address, the actual statistic using the data from the same report is 31, and partial data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggests that the average age could be even lower than that. We rate the claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
