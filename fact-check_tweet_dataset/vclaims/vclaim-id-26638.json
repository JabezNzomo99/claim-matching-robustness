He wrote nearly 30 comedies, tragedies and dramatic operas and, in 1668, was appointed England\u2019s first poet laureate.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation searched a collection of Dryden\u2019s complete works but found no evidence he ever said or wrote the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post.

It appears, unattributed, directly above another quote ascribed to Dryden, and it\u2019s possible that readers mistakenly linked the alleged saying to Dryden due to its proximity to the other quotation, according to Quote Investigator.\n\nWhile there is no evidence that Dryden authored the saying attributed to him in the Facebook post, he did write a line about habits in his translation of Ovid\u2019s \u201cMetamorphoses\u201d that reads, \u201cIll Habits gather by unseen degrees, As Brooks make Rivers, Rivers run to Seas.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
