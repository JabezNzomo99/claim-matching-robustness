The same analysis looked at how, in some situations, funding rates for older age groups in less deprived areas could increase.\n\nAbout 2.5 million apprenticeships have been created since 2010, slightly more than Theresa May suggests.\n\nThe government has set a target to create 3 million by 2020.\n\nThis article originally stated that the proposed changes would take place in March. The apprenticeship levy will be introduced from 6th April, and the changes to funding rates are proposed to start from 1st May.", "lang": "en"}
