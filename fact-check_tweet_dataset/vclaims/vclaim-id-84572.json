The two photographs circle \u201cAW139\u201d as proof that it is the same helicopter. The claim was also the subject of a now deleted article by Janata ka Reporter titled \u201cQuestions raised on rapist Gurmeet Singh allegedly using \u2018Adani\u2019s\u2019 helicopter, also used by PM Modi.\u201d Is there any truth behind these claims?\n\nThe claims have shared widely on social media and they assert that 1) The helicopter is owned by the Adani Group. 2) It is the same helicopter that was used by PM Modi\n\nIs the helicopter owned by the Adani Group?\n\nThe DGCA list of non-scheduled air operator permits lists 10 AgustaWestland AW139 helicopters. According to this list, the Adani group does not own an AW 139. Karnavati Aviation, the aviation company of the Adani group owns three aircrafts \u2013 Hawker 850XP, Bombardier CL 600-2B16 and Embraer Legacy 650. All three are executive jets, not helicopters.\n\nA spokesperson of the Adani group confirmed to Boom fact check that the group \u201chas never ever owned or leased any helicopter.\u201d He also clarified that they had placed an order for an AgustaWestland helicopter a few years ago but later cancelled it.\n\nNow that we know that the helicopter did not belong to the Adani Group, let us look at the second part of the claim.\n\nAre the digits AW139 proof that it is the same helicopter?\n\nTo circle \u201cAW139\u201d as proof in the images by social media users doesn\u2019t say much. AgustaWestland AW139 is the name of the helicopter model. It is not a unique registration number of the aircraft. To use a model number as proof is like circling \u201cA 8\u201d and claiming that it is the same Audi car without matching the number plate. To confirm whether it is the same aircraft, we need to match the aircraft registration number.\n\nThe aircraft registration number of the aircraft is not visible in this picture but in another picture by PTI, it shows it clearly as VT-TWO\n\nHow do we find out who owns VT-TWO? A database that lists all the AgustaWestland AW139 airframes in India shows it as owned by DLF. The same is also confirmed by the DGCA list\n\nAs reported by India Today, \u201cthe authorities said the helicopter used for transporting Baba Ram Rahim was hired but did not specify from where.\u201d\n\nWas it the same helicopter used by Narendra Modi\n\nThe helicopter used by Narendra Modi in his 2014 election campaign belonged to the DLF group. DLF owns one aircraft, an AgustaWestland AW139 with the aircraft registration number VT-TWO.\n\nLooking at the PTI image with the aircraft registration number, we can say that the two pictures of the helicopters used by PM Modi and the Haryana government to ferry Gurmeet Singh are indeed of the same helicopter.\n\nWe presume the helicopter was chartered by the Haryana government from DLF. It is not unusual for companies to offer their aircrafts for charter flights when they are not being used by company executives. This helps them to cover the cost of maintaining the aircraft. Unless more facts emerge to the contrary, Alt News does not believe that the same aircraft being chartered by two parties can be the basis for any allegations of wrongdoing.", "lang": "en"}
