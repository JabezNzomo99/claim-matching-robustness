Since that date, some rules have changed. For the latest on what counts as essential travel during lockdown we've more up to date information here.\n\nA post shared hundreds of times on Facebook claims to show a list of rules for the UK\u2019s Covid-19 lockdown. Many things on this list are not correct. It is actually a copy of a list which claimed to show lockdown rules in Spain, which is largely accurate.\n\nThe UK government has said it will review its current guidance on the lockdown in three weeks. We will update this story if it changes.\n\nThis isn\u2019t quite correct. As well as supermarkets, pharmacies and petrol stations, the government guidance says other food shops, health shops, bicycle shops, home and hardware shops, laundrettes and dry cleaners, car rentals, pet shops and veterinary surgeries, corner shops and newsagents, post offices, off-licences and breweries, car garages and vehicle rental shops and banks can remain open. All other retail stores, including hair and beauty salons and massage parlours, must close.\n\nThis is broadly correct. Restaurants and caf\u00e9s can still provide food delivery and takeaway but must close to other customers. Pubs and bars must remain closed.\n\nThis is not correct. Under the new guidance, you can leave the house for one of four reasons: shopping for basic necessities, one form of exercise a day, any medical need or to provide care or to help a vulnerable person, and travelling to and from work if you \u201cabsolutely cannot\u201d work from home.\n\nIf your child is still attending school, because you work in a critical sector, you can continue to take them there. Where parents don\u2019t live together, children under 18 can be moved between their parents\u2019 homes.\n\nEven when doing these activities, you should spend as little time outside of the home as possible and ensure you are two metres apart from people you don\u2019t live with.\n\nNo guidance has been released specifying the number of people allowed in a car. However, you should continue to follow the government\u2019s social distancing rules, and avoid seeing friends or family who you do not live with, which includes being in a car with them.\n\nThere are no rules saying that pets can only be walked within 50 metres of your home. Everyone is still allowed one form of exercise a day, alone or with members of their household. This could include walking dogs. There are no restrictions on how near to your home you must stay, but the government says you should spend as little time as possible outside of your home and stay two metres away from people you don\u2019t live with.\n\nSome areas of parks are closed, such as children\u2019s playgrounds, sports courts and pitches and outdoor gyms. There are no rules requiring parks or beaches to close, although some have anyway. Hammersmith and Fulham council in London has decided to close its parks, and the National Trust has closed its parks and gardens. Others, like The Royal Parks in London, have suggested they may have to close if people do not follow social distancing guidelines. We haven\u2019t seen any reports of beaches closing in the UK.\n\nThis is not correct. Everyone is allowed one form of exercise a day, alone or with other members of their households. This can include a walk or bike ride. Again, you should spend as little time out of the house as possible and stay two metres away from anyone you don\u2019t live with.\n\nThis is wrong. There are no rules requiring the wearing of gloves in supermarkets or anywhere else.\n\nThe government recommends people stay two metres apart from those they don\u2019t live with. No specific guidance on queuing has been released though some supermarkets have asked their customers to stay this far apart when queuing.\n\nPolice will be able to fine people and businesses who do not follow the rules set out by the government (although as we\u2019ve already said, these aren\u2019t the rules included in the Facebook post). Businesses and premises that stay open in breach of the rules could receive potentially unlimited fines.\n\nNew regulations mean the police can instruct members of the public to go home or leave an area, and ensure parents are stopping their children from breaking the rules. They can issue a fine of \u00a360, lowered to \u00a330 if paid within 14 days. This fine rises to \u00a3120 for second time offenders, and doubles for each further repeated offence. Police can also arrest people \u201cwhere deemed proportionate and necessary\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
