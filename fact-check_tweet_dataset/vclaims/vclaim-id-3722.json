In fact it is just an old copy-paste job from a now deleted older satirical (and fake) Facebook post from 2015. We've embedded the more recent post below (archived here):\n\nThe full text of the post read:\n\nTHIS IS HUGE. Does anyone know why the mainstream media will not pick this up? The two officers seen in this photo have killed at least 250 people in the line of duty behind thier badges. Shane Walsh, the officer to the left has killed 41 people while on duty, before being murdered in cold blood by none other than his best friend and partner, the man to the right, Richard Grimes back on a cold autum night in late 2011. This was primarily in relation to an argument and custody dispute over who was the better father and lover to Richards wife, Lorie Grimes. Deputy Walsh was believed to have slept with Lorie Grimes on multiple occasions and it is understood that she is also pregnant with Deputy Walsh's child. To make matters worse Deputy Grimes has been indemnified and is still allowed to retain his position as a full time deputy sheriff in the State of Georgia and maintains custody of his son Carl as well as Judith, the newborn love child of his deceased wife and partner. Richard \"Rick\" Grimes has killed 200 plus in the line of duty and is for many reasons a very unstable father to his children. We have to take a stand and speak out against these types of people. And if it can not get any worse, Donald Trump just does not care. He states and we quote\"They are very fine people\".. can you say white privelage? :\\ Follow for more updates on these satirical-officers.\n\nSnopes already debunked this one in 2016 as being a parody about popular TV show The Walking Dead, but just like a zombie this article keeps coming back alive on one Facebook page after another where it gets believed by people who don't pick up on the satire because they don't watch The Walking Dead or they just assume the \"satirical-officers\" at the end must have been a typo.", "lang": "en"}
