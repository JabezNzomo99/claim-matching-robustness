Bush pushed for an to install 10 interceptor missiles on the ground in Poland and an advanced radar system in the Czech Republic, to counter the potential threat of long-range missiles from Iran. Russia did not like the idea one bit.\n\nRussian defense minister Sergei Ivanov told the Russian news organization that Russia was opposed and that the plans did not make \"political sense, much less military sense.\"\n\nDuring the 2008 election, candidate Obama said he supported the installations in Poland and the Czech Republic but also said he was open to rethinking them.\n\nWhen Obama took office in 2009, he spoke of making U.S. relations with Russia less confrontational. The symbol of this was a photo-op of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton presenting her Russian counterpart with a \" button.\n\nThree years after Bush announced his missile defense proposal, Obama changed course. On Sept. 17, 2009, announced that the United States would pursue a new missile defense policy focused on knocking out short- and medium-range Iranian missiles. The new plan relied on missiles based on American warships and eventually sites closer to Iran.\n\nThe response at home and overseas\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, released statements suggesting that Obama was being soft and letting down American allies. Pundits like John Bolton, whom Bush had appointed as ambassador to the United Nations, said Russia and Iran came away as \" \" in a \"bad day for American national security.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Israel and most NATO countries in Western Europe approved of the move, news stories show, because they thought the missile system provoked Russia. Polish and Czech leaders .\n\nObama left it to Defense Secretary Robert Gates to explain the shift. In a , and later in his 2014 book Duty, Gates said that Defense Department officials realized the Iranian government was putting more stock into building short- and medium-range missiles over long-range ones. The agency wanted to uproot the old plan to better counteract that threat, and the new tactic Gates and the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended to Obama was cheaper and took less time to implement.\n\nLance Janda, chairman of the Department of History and Government at Cameron University, added that the full U.S. strategy included in Eastern Europe starting in 2018. Lost in the GOP fury, Gates wrote, was that the Russians found Obama\u2019s new approach to be even more worrisome than the Bush-era plan. They worried that those missiles could easily be configured to thwart them as well as Iran.\n\nCheney said Obama dropped a missile defense plan based in Poland and the Czech Republic on the \"mere request\" of Putin. While Putin strenuously objected to the plan, a Pentagon reassessment of the nature of Iran\u2019s capabilities was the actual reason for the change. The Pentagon saw a greater danger from Iranian short-and-medium-range missiles than the long range missiles that were targeted in the original plan.\n\nNATO allies and Israel also favored the new approach, which included steps to install a missile defense system in Poland in 2018.\n\nSo, Obama did forgo the Bush-era plan, but he didn\u2019t do it at the \"mere request\" of Putin.
