Its judge, Suzanne Covington, is stepping down.\n\n \n\n Opposing Patterson in the March 2 Democratic primary is Austin lawyer Amy Clark Meachum, a partner in the law firm McGinnis, Lochridge & Kilgore. Meachum's readiness to be a judge draws fire from Patterson in a TV ad that debuted on Austin News 8 on Jan. 20, whose narrator writes Meachum off, saying: \"Zero times a judge, zero rulings, zero experience on the bench \u2014 our legal system is no place for on-the-job training.\"\n\n \n\n Meachum's campaign drew our attention to the ad when her field director, Katie Naranjo, issued this response: \"Yesterday, Amy's opponent, Jan Patterson, launched a personal, negative television ad... if you are as disappointed as I am that Jan Patterson would resort to personal attacks against Amy, click here and make a contribution to our campaign so we can respond.\"\n\n \n\n Meachum doesn't deny Patterson's charges, though, writing to us: \"I have not hidden from nor run from the fact that I have never been a judge.\"\n\n \n\n \"In the past decade, I have more experience in the civil district court that I am running for than Justice Patterson does,\" she said. \"She has been an appellate judge \u2014 I have been a civil trial attorney.\"\n\n \n\n Meachum estimated that she's litigated 50-70 cases in Travis County.\n\n \n\n Patterson is correct that Meachum has never been a judge. We rate her statement as True.", "lang": "en"}
