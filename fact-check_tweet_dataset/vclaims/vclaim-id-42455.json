It claims that all chilling stations of the company will be closed for an indefinite time from March 21, 2020. \u201c\u0935\u093f\u0937\u092f : \u0915\u094b\u0930\u094b\u0928\u093e \u0935\u093e\u092f\u0930\u0938 \u0915\u0940 \u092c\u091c\u0939 \u0938\u0947 \u091a\u093f\u0932\u093f\u0902\u0917 \u0938\u0947\u0902\u091f\u0930 \u092c\u0902\u0926 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0928\u094d\u0927 (Subject: Regarding the closure of chilling stations due to coronavirus)\u201d \u2013 reads the subject line of the notice.\n\nAlt News could neither locate any such information on the Amul website or news reports alerting that the company has decided to suspend business due to coronavirus. The managing director of the cooperative body Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) RS Sodhi took to Twitter and informed that the notice is fake. Amul is managed by GCMMF.\n\n\u201cNone of our milk chilling centre or procurement activities are going to close down. Rather we are procuring more,\u201d wrote Sodhi.\n\nA Financial Express article quotes Sodhi saying that milk supply will not be disrupted due to the spread of COVID-19. \u201cAccording to Sodhi there has been sizable shift of demand for milk from retail outlets to e-commerce platforms and Amul kiosk because of coronavirus scare,\u201d reads the report.\n\nSpeaking with Zee News, he also said that people are indulging in panic buys and hoarding of supplies in cities such as Mumbai, Pune and Bangalore due to which the sales of milk power, ghee, butter, etc has shot up. However, \u201cthis is not creating any problem related to supply at our end as we keep an inventory of 15-20 days in advance. This has helped us in increasing our production. Thus there is no such shortage,\u201d he continued.\n\nA fake notice is therefore viral in the name of Amul, claiming that the company will shut down its chilling centres from March 21.", "lang": "en"}
