Here\u2019s a round-up of some fake news The Quint\u2019s Team Webqoof busted in October. It might be festival season but as we\u2019ve come to realise, fake news is never on holiday. PM Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Mahabalipuram near Chennai received the global attention it deserved as well as more more which was completely unwarranted. The fake news factory focused on Modiji\u2019s plogging \u2013 the combination of jogging and picking up litter from the beach. A photo of a camera crew was shared on Twitter with the claim that it was part of the 25-member crew who shot Modiji's Swachch Bharat endeavour. The screenshot of the tweet with the false claim. The photo was actually that of a camera crew on a beach in Australia but opened the floodgates for more random beach photos being shared with the same claim! Twitter is still at sea when it comes to fake news while those sharing unverified forwards refuse to clam up!\n\nMeanwhile, on 18 October, in an interview with Network18\u2019s Rahul Joshi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah denied the increasing incidence of lynchings in India under the BJP. \u201cThe instances of so called mob-lynchings haven\u2019t increased under the BJP. A certain propaganda is being created about this,\u201d Shah had said. Is there any basis to this claim?\n\n\n\nThe Ministry of Home Affairs\u2019 response to a question in the Lok Sabha on mob lynchings in India said that 45 people were lynched between 2014 and 2017 in 40 cases of mob violence across 21 states and Union Territories. Just saying! Tata Salt Packed Manually? No, Video Is From Raid on Fake Products On 4 October, news agency PTI reported the IAF showed a video clip of \u2018Balakot strikes\u2019 at its annual press conference. However, it was actually IAF\u2019s promotional video that was screened ahead of the press conference. Several news media outlets including Republic TV, Zee, Firstpost and Times Now ran with \u2018The untold story of Balakot airstrikes\u2019. That's this month's strike-out for the media. The screenshot of fake news carried by Republic TV.\n\nOctober\u2019s fake news trend has been to attribute fake photos to real news, thereby twisting the narrative. Like the video from Riyadh of a man physically abusing a child shared as a DPS teacher beating a student. Or the viral video of PMC depositors emptying lockers shared as PMC promoters emptying lockers... Moral of the story, not all news shared on social media is trustworthy, especially if it comes with pictures or a video!
