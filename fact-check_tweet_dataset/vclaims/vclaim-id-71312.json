The claim is misleading; the photo in fact shows lorries that were used in a political initiative in 2014, more than five years before the coronavirus pandemic. Rajapaksa\u2019s office also denied the claim, saying that authorities are pursuing legal action against those spreading the \u201cfalse information\u201d.\n\nThe photo was published on Facebook here on March 25, 2020. Next to the image of Rajapaksa, the lorries in the photo also feature the logo of Sathosa, a state owned retailer.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Sinhala-language caption translates to English as: \"Before feeding people and saving lives, one must spend well on branding\u2026 Don\u2019t talk about politics in this time\".\n\nThe post was published the same day that the government announced Sathos would join other supermarket chains to deliver groceries during the nationwide curfew implemented to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe same image was shared on Facebook here, here and here and on Twitter here with a similar claim.\n\nThe photo actually shows lorries that were used in 2014 in a distribution campaign organized by Rajapaksa, who was then serving as president. Other photos of the same fleet were published here on December 4, 2014 by Sri Lanka's Daily Mirror newspaper, in an article headlined \u201cSathosa lorries carry MR image\u201d.\n\nThe lorries in the misleading post\u2019s photo and the Daily Mirror\u2019s photos both show identical branding and bear the logo of Mahinda Chinthana, Rajapaksa\u2019s former election manifesto. The manifesto\u2019s multi-coloured ribbon and lotus blossom logo was discontinued from use following Rajapaksa\u2019s failed presidential bid in 2015.\n\nBelow is a comparison of the images with the specific branding marked by AFP:\n\nRajapaksa\u2019s media secretary, Wijayananda Herath, denied the claim that branded Sathosa vehicles were being used to deliver goods during the coronavirus curfew.\n\n\u201cThese false claims were brought before the attention of the PM yesterday. PM\u2019s lawyers lodged a complaint with the Colombo Crimes Division so that legal action can be pursued against those who attempt to disrupt the programs devised by the government during the coronavirus crisis using false information,\u201d Herath told AFP by phone on March 26, 2020.", "lang": "en"}
