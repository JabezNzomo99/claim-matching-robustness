And the president\u2019s words \u2014 the phrases he utters and the tweets he makes \u2014 tell a different story, according to a comprehensive record maintained by factba.se. His commentary about the media is virtually all about how it affects him, especially if he thinks the news coverage is negative. One searches in vain for statements that mirror the language of Pence or State Department officials.\n\nActually, that\u2019s the core of the First Amendment. News organizations have a responsibility to get it right \u2014 and good ones correct their mistakes \u2014 but as the Supreme Court made clear in New York Times v. Sullivan (1964), a public figure must be able to prove a news organization knew a statement was false or recklessly disregarded whether it was false before libel can be considered. The 9-0 ruling setting a standard of \u201cactual malice\u201d notably came in the context of the civil rights movement, as Southern officials repeatedly filed defamation suits to thwart coverage of civil rights.\n\nOr, as Trump put it more recently, in a July interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News: \u201cWell, when I say enemy of the people, I\u2019m not talking about all of the media. I\u2019m talking about there is a big percentage of the media, when you look at CNN, how false their reports are. When you look at NBC and some of the others, when you read the New York Times, it\u2019s just a story after story after story that\u2019s just a negative spin.\u201d\n\nIn August, when Ivanka Trump said that she did not believe the media is enemy of the people, Trump tweeted that a \u201clarge percentage\u201d of the media was fake news: \u201cThey asked my daughter Ivanka whether or not the media is the enemy of the people. She correctly said no. It is the FAKE NEWS, which is a large percentage of the media, that is the enemy of the people!\u201d\n\nChris Wallace, in his \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d interview that aired Nov. 18, sought to pin Trump down on the fine line he appears to draw between \u201cfake news\u201d and the media. Trump asserted that \u201cnobody believes in the First Amendment more than I do\u201d and that \u201cI don\u2019t mind getting bad news if I\u2019m wrong.\u201d When Wallace noted that \u201cleaders in authoritarian countries like Russia, China, Venezuela now repress the media using your words,\u201d Trump rejected any connection and passed up the opportunity to reaffirm his belief in freedom of the press. \u201cI can\u2019t talk for other people, I can only talk for me,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Nov. 16, for instance, Trump dropped in the phrase in the context of reporters being polite to him: \u201cYou have to practice decorum. You were there; you understood, and you understand. We want total freedom of the press; that\u2019s very important to me. It\u2019s more important to me than anybody would believe. But you have to act with respect. You\u2019re in the White House.\u201d\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Pence has defended the president\u2019s tone, saying that Trump, too, believes that freedom of the press is a \u201ccore American principle\u201d and that he\u2019s only calling out reports that twist the truth. \u201cPresident Trump and I are deeply committed to a free and independent press,\u201d he told Politico. \u201cWe also are committed to the freedom of speech and the ability of public men and women to call out the press when we think that they\u2019re not calling it straight.\u201d\n\nThe president from time to time drops in a reference to \u201cfreedom of the press,\u201d but it\u2019s when he is talking about how he is treated by the media. There\u2019s never been a stand-alone statement, fulsome and complete, like the statements that effortlessly are made by Pence, especially in foreign settings. No one has a bigger megaphone than the U.S. president, so the laudable efforts of the rest of the government often are smothered by the fury from the White House.", "lang": "en"}
