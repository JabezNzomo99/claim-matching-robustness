The article could have reached 1.5 million netizens.\n\nThe FB groups and pages that shared the misleading article wrote the same caption: \u201cIyong inaasahan ng mga artista, binawi pa (The only thing the [ABS-CBN] actors were banking on was revoked).\u201d\n\nThe posts are still active; comments still pour in, three days after the write-up was first shared. Netizens continue to remark on how the media company \u201cdeserved\u201d to remain closed and that \u201cthe rule of law\u201d was observed when Congress \u201cdid not grant its franchise.\u201d Some even chastised House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano for \u201cgranting the franchise\u201d in the first place.\n\nWorld.News\u2019 misleading article, which embedded a May 18 SMNI News report entitled \u201cKAMARA, binawi ang pagpasa sa ABS-CBN Franchise Bill sa second reading (House of Representatives revoked the passage of the ABS-CBN Franchise Bill on second reading), failed to include an accurate explanation of what transpired during the House of Representatives\u2019 May 18 session.\n\nHB 6732 was ready for its third and final reading but Cayetano announced on May 19 that the House would forego talks on a provisional franchise for ABS-CBN following calls by several representatives that the bill\u2019s approval on second reading be reconsidered.\n\nAlbay First District Rep. Edcel Lagman in his interpellation said that the passage of the bill on both first and second reading on the same day is a violation of the Constitution. The House then agreed to re-open the period of sponsorship, interpellation, debate, and amendments for the bill\u2019s second reading.\n\nOn May 26, the House Committee on Legislative Franchise will begin to tackle bills granting ABS-CBN a 25-year franchise. According to several news reports, Cayetano said hearings on the bills will continue even as Congress adjourns on June 5 and not reopen until July. The House Speaker said they aim to arrive at a decision by August, after the president\u2019s State of the Nation Address in July.\n\nABS-CBN\u2019s 42 television stations, 23 radio stations and 10 digital channels have been off the air since May 5 following a cease-and-desist order issued by the National Telecommunications Commission. It asked the Supreme Court to stop the order but the Court deferred action on the petition. On May 19, it gave NTC and Congress 10 days within which to comment on the network's petition.\n\nPRESIDENT RODY DUTERTE -FEDERAL MOVEMENT INTERNATIONAL was created in November 2014, while SolidDuterte and Duterte-Marcos Real Change joined FB in December 2017 and April 2016, respectively.", "lang": "en"}
