The corruption is immense! We need Trump elected to save our country! According to new WikiLeaks emails, three days before Justice Scalia died this email was sent, using the term \u201cwetworks\u201d \u2014 exclusively used in Military meaning \u201cassassination\u201d.\n\nThe item referenced a leaked e-mail sent on 9 February 2016, four days before Justice Scalia was found dead in his room at a Texas ranch. E-mail in that chain was presented in reverse chronological order (with the most recent reply first) \u2014 sender John Podesta initiated the chain at 4:36 PM, and recipient Steve Elmendorf responded at 8:56 PM:\n\nBased on Wikipedia\u2019s definition of the term, RedStateWatcher claimed that the \u201cwet works\u201d phrase used in the otherwise vague e-mail was incontrovertible proof it referenced a literal assassination:\n\nClaims that Scalia was assassinated were not novel, as within a day of his death conspiracy theories about the manner in which he died swept social media. And the newly-leaked document was contemporaneous to Scalia\u2019s sudden passing, heightening concern about the use of the term \u201cwet work\u201d (or \u201cwetwork\u201d).\n\nHowever, dictionaries present a broader picture of the term and its applied uses:\n\nIn fact, the term had then-recently been used euphemistically, to describe Chelsea Clinton\u2019s campaign trail attacks on her mother\u2019s Democratic primary opponent, Bernie Sanders:\n\nConservative websites gleefully denounced Chelsea the \u201cattack dog.\u201d Democrats, meanwhile, wrung their hands over why she of all people would be dispatched to do this kind of wet work. (As strategist Brad Bannon told The Hill, \u201cThis makes Chelsea just another political player in the arena, and if I was Chelsea, that\u2019s not where I\u2019d want to be.\u201d) And a media bored to sobs with the Democratic primary leapt on the episode like ducks on a June bug. Commentators mused endlessly about why the Clinton camp had taken this route and what it meant. (Consensus: nothing good.) Bernie Sanders was repeatedly invited to respond. Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Halperin might have sounded a smidge melodramatic when he asserted, \u201cI have covered the Clintons since 1991. It takes a lot to surprise me, and I am stunned watching Chelsea Clinton go on the attack. Stunned. Never seen anything like it.\u201d\n\nIn media coverage, \u201cwet work[s]\u201d was being used to describe deliberately obtained unflattering coverage of an opponent. And on the same day that the e-mails supposedly describing an assassination plot were sent, Alex Seitz-Wald penned an article for MSNBC that described Bernie Sanders as a regular attendee of luxurious fundraisers, particularly in Martha\u2019s Vineyard. The piece also reported both Bill and Hillary Clinton as performing the same sort of \u201cwet work\u201d as Chelsea Clinton:\n\nThe Sanders campaign is all about smashing the alleged stranglehold corporate power has on politics, and the candidate himself frequently touts that his insurgent run is funded by small donations, not wealthy people or outside groups. It\u2019s been an effective message, and one pro-Clinton forces have tried to muddy by calling attention to Sanders\u2019 ties to the DSCC [Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee], which is financed in large part by industry PACs. The DSCC used its financial and political power to bolster Sanders and urge Democrats not to challenge him in his 2006 Senate bid, and spent close to $200,000 through various means to aid his election. Bill Clinton said this week that he \u201cpractically fell out of my chair\u201d when he read reports that Sanders had attended the DSCC\u2019s summer donor retreats on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, and Hillary Clinton said Sanders took Wall Street cash \u201cnot directly, but through the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\u201d The Sanders campaign fired back by calling the charge \u201cdisturbing,\u201d \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201cbeyond preposterous,\u201d noting the DSCC also receives small donations and is hardly exclusively funded by Wall Street.\n\nAlthough MSNBC published the piece on 9 February 2016, the topic of Sanders\u2019 DSCC retreats was the subject of e-mails dated 6 and 7 February 2016. In that chain, campaign associates looked to have discovered a photograph of Sanders at such a retreat and brainstormed ways in which to get a member of the press to cover his attendance at a February 2016 DSCC fundraiser (the e-mail appeared to have an appended image of Sanders titled IMG_0692.JPG).\n\nRearranged in chronological order, the chain demonstrated Hillary Clinton\u2019s staffers planning how best to attack her opponent with retreat image and information about the lavish fundraisers:\n\nTina Flournoy stated Sanders attended a DSCC event in July 2015, and on the date of the \u201cwet work\u201d e-mail (to which Podesta was also party) Seitz-Wald wrote:\n\nDuring his 10 years on the Senate, Bernie Sanders has been a regular presence at luxurious Democratic fundraising retreats, according to more than a half-dozen lobbyists, donors and former Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee staff members with whom he attended the events. Sanders most recently appeared at one last July, shortly after he announced his presidential run. Sanders\u2019 connection to the DSCC has become a issue in his heated primary contest with front-runner Hillary Clinton, who has struggled to explain her close ties to Wall Street and the large speaking fees she\u2019s been paid by Goldman Sachs and other banks. Sanders has made Clinton\u2019s relationships with the financial industry a key point of contrast on the campaign trail.\n\nOn 13 February 2016, Clinton campaign operatives e-mailed about continuing to use the fundraisers as a smear:\n\nRearranged into the context of Antonin Scalia\u2019s death, the use of the term \u201cwet work\u201d was presumed by many to mean literal assassination. But e-mails between staffers just prior to the 9 February 2016 document revealed planning for a coordinated effort to plant a negative story about Sanders in the press in the days prior to the 9 February 2016 e-mail and article. On the date Podesta discussed \u201cwet work\u201d with Elmendorf, MSNBC published the coverage sought by Clinton\u2019s staffers on 6 and 7 February 2016. As such, the most likely victim of the \u201cwet work\u201d was not Scalia, but Sanders.", "lang": "en"}
