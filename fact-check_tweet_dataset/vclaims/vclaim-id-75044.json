(This argument, which takes the logical form of \"X is possible, therefore X is true,\" is a logical fallacy known as an appeal to possibility.) Yet in the very next breath the author doubles back, acknowledging \"this may not be true.\"\n\nThe item then cycles through a host of fringe theories, including the Spaceship Moon hypothesis (also known as the Hollow Moon hypothesis). This idea, put forth in 1970 by two members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, holds that the moon is actually a hollow spaceship built by aliens.\n\nThis theory has been roundly debunked by planetary scientists.\n\nDr. Renee Weber, who manages the Heliophysics and Planetary Science Division at NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center, said in a 2011 interview that none of NASA\u2019s findings support the Hollow Moon theory.\n\nKaren Masters, an associate professor in astronomy and astrophysics at the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation at the University of Portsmouth in England, also addressed the fringe theory in a 2015 online forum hosted by Cornell University.\n\n\"The Moon is not hollow,\" Masters said. \"It is possible to tell this because when we have had things in orbit around the Moon, how they orbit in the Moon's gravity tells us about the mass of the Moon. We also know the size of the Moon so we can work out the density and see that it is not possible for the Moon to be hollow.\"\n\nThis bogus item follows a familiar fake news formula, wending its way from a shocking clickbait-y headline, through muddled reasoning that attempts to buttress an ultimately absurd central premise.\n\nOne thing that is true: This claim is hollow. We rate it Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
