We have been net beneficiaries of the European Union.\u201d\n\nThese figures appear to come from the Royal Society, an association of scientists. The thrust of the analysis seems right, although the UK is a net contributor to the wider EU budget. In other words, we get more out than we put in when it comes to science and technology, but pay in more than we get back overall.\n\nDispensing with the pedantry first: these numbers are in euro rather than pounds, and cover a seven-year period (2007-2013) rather than five. \u20ac8.8 billion is what UK researchers saw in EU grants in that period, made up of \u20ac6.9 billion from the main EU funding programme for research and \u20ac1.9 billion from another pot of money. (We haven\u2019t found the original source for this last figure, but as the equivalent for 2014-2020 is \u20ac1.6 billion, there\u2019s little reason to doubt it.)\n\nBy contrast, figures from the Treasury show that the UK\u2019s \u201cindicative contribution\u201d to EU research coffers was \u00a34.5 billion (\u20ac5.4 billion). So the UK was ahead of the game by a couple of billion. This may explain why many university leaders were strongly opposed to leaving the EU.\n\nThe government has guaranteed to replace EU research funding, if necessary, in the next few years. But the question of participation in these programmes in the long term depends on negotiations with the 27 remaining members.\n\nWhile non-EU countries are part of the research funding structure, there are potential difficulties with the UK becoming one of these associate members\u2014including its status as a net beneficiary, which effectively reduces the money available to everyone else. We\u2019ll have to see how negotiations pan out.", "lang": "en"}
