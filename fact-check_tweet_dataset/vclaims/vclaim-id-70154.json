Ricardo Lara, who is running for California Insurance Commissioner, showcased his opponent\u2019s past stance on immigration in recent full-page newspaper ads in Sacramento and the Central Valley.\n\nThis claim from the ads caught our attention:\n\n\"As Insurance Commissioner, Steve Poizner pledged to block immigrant children from ever getting MediCal health insurance.\"\n\nThe Ricardo Lara for Insurance Commissioner 2018 campaign produced the ad above.\n\nPoizner, who served as insurance commissioner from 2007 to 2011, is running for the open position this year after switching his party affiliation from Republican to Independent.\n\nThe incumbent, Democrat Dave Jones, is termed out.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s insurance commissioner regulates the insurance industry and implements state law, but does not create it.\n\nWe wanted to know whether Lara\u2019s claim about Poizner was accurate. We set out on a fact check.\n\nWhen asked about the claim, Lara\u2019s campaign consultant Richie Ross pointed to a campaign ad from Poizner's 2010 run for governor, when he took several hard-line stances on immigration.\n\nThe ad shows a car crashing off a cliff, as Poizner says:\n\n\"We all know California is heading right over a cliff. How did this happen? Years of liberal failure doing too much for too many. Take illegal immigration: Politicians have lacked the guts to tackle the problem. As governor, I will stop taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal immigrants.\"\n\nIn the ad, Poizner doesn\u2019t specifically bring up health benefits, but instead makes the blanket pledge to stop all benefits for undocumented Californians.\n\nIn April, Poizner told newspaper editorial boards he\u2019s changed some of his positions on immigration.\n\n\"I regret the tone and direction that we took in that campaign,\" he said in an interview with the Bay Area News Group editorial board this week, calling his approach in that race \"wrong and harmful.\"\n\nPoizner told the editorial board that he now believes everyone who\u2019s undocumented should be \"put on a path to get documented,\" and young people in the DACA program should be eligible for U.S. citizenship, The Mercury News reported.\n\nHe also told the San Francisco Chronicle editorial board he no longer wants to cut tuition benefits to undocumented immigrants.\n\nPoizner said he took his previous anti-immigrant positions while under \"huge pressure\" in a competitive primary race against former eBay CEO Meg Whitman, according to the newspaper.\n\nPoizner\u2019s campaign did not respond to three requests from PolitiFact California on where he stands on the specific issue of providing health benefits to undocumented children.\n\nDuring his time in the Legislature, Lara has worked to expand health coverage to all undocumented Californians. In 2015, Gov. Jerry Brown signed Lara's Health For All Kids Act 2015, which gave Medi-Cal coverage to undocumented kids and teens.\n\nDemocratic State Sen. Ricardo Lara claimed in full-page newspaper ads that his opponent in California\u2019s Insurance Commissioner race, Steve Poizner, \"pledged to block immigrant children from ever getting MediCal health insurance,\" when Poizner previously held the state post.\n\nPoizner did make a general promise to block benefits for undocumented Californians, though that was eight years ago, in a Republican primary race for governor. He said in an ad: \"I will stop taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal immigrants,\" though he didn\u2019t specify the kind of benefits.\n\nNotably, Lara\u2019s statement ignores Poizner\u2019s shift on immigration. Poizner told newspapers this spring he now favors some benefits for undocumented Californians and a path to citizenship for DACA recipients, and that his past approach was \"harmful.\"\n\nPoizner\u2019s campaign did not respond to requests about his stance on health benefits for undocumented children, leaving his position on that unclear.\n\nIn the end, we found there\u2019s some truth to Lara\u2019s statement, but it leaves out important details and takes things out of context.\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
