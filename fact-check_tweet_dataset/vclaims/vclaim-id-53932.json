According to the publication:\n\nThe DOJ requests \u2014 which are unlikely to make it through a Democratic-led House \u2014 span several stages of the legal process, from initial arrest to how cases are processed and investigated. In one of the documents, the department proposed that Congress grant the attorney general power to ask the chief judge of any district court to pause court proceedings \u201cwhenever the district court is fully or partially closed by virtue of any natural disaster, civil disobedience, or other emergency situation.\u201d The proposal would also grant those top judges broad authority to pause court proceedings during emergencies. It would apply to \u201cany statutes or rules of procedure otherwise affecting pre-arrest, post-arrest, pre-trial, trial, and post-trial procedures in criminal and juvenile proceedings and all civil process and proceedings,\u201d according to draft legislative language the department shared with Congress. In making the case for the change, the DOJ wrote that individual judges can currently pause proceedings during emergencies but that their proposal would make sure all judges in any particular district could handle emergencies \u201cin a consistent manner.\u201d\n\nAs often happens, the most salient aspect of this report was picked up and aggregated by various other websites, with attention-grabbing headlines like this one on the liberal-leaning site HillReporter: \u201cTrump\u2019s Justice Department Wants To Suspend Habeas Corpus.\u201d The stories circulating online prompted readers to ask Snopes to verify whether the claim is true.\n\nIt\u2019s true DOJ has proposed legislation that would grant nationwide authority to federal judges to extend deadlines and pause or suspend statutes of limitation, which are essentially court-case deadlines that afford the accused speedy trials. The DOJ, which consists of federal litigators, is part of Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s executive branch. However, per a DOJ statement, these proposed powers would not be conferred upon the executive branch. The proposal would apply to federal district judges and would expire with the end of the national emergency brought by the pandemic.\n\nWhether the proposal will be adopted is unknown, and it would have to clear a Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives first.\n\nCaroline Fredrickson, senior fellow at New York University Law School\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice, explained the DOJ\u2019s proposed legislation in an opinion piece for the Washington Post. It seeks modifications to what\u2019s known as the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which govern how federal criminal cases are handled by courts. The proposed changes could result in detained defendants being held indefinitely, she wrote, allowing a judge \u201cto order someone who had simply been arrested, but not charged or convicted, to be held until the judge determines the emergency is over.\u201d\n\nThat, Fredrickson argued, would represent an unacceptable blow to habeas corpus, the \u201cconstitutional guarantee that a detained person has the right to appear in court for a determination of whether his or her detention is lawful.\u201d\n\nWe were unable to independently view the documents cited by Politico. However, DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec confirmed their existence by addressing the topic in a statement posted to Twitter. Kupec\u2019s tweets stated that \u201cconfusion\u201d related to reports about the DOJ asking Congress for \u201cemergency powers\u201d was \u201ctriggered by Congress asking DOJ for suggested proposals necessary to ensure that federal courts would be able to administer fair and impartial justice during pandemic.\u201d\n\nKupec stated that individual judges are already taking actions to cope with the burden on the courts during the COVID-19 crisis, and the proposal would just normalize those actions. She said the provisions \u201cwould give the Chief Judge in the [federal court] district the authority to extend deadlines and toll [pause] statute of limitations in the interests of justice. Again, individual judges already have the authority and are adjusting many deadlines.\u201d Another proposal, she added, would allow the chief justice of the federal [court] district \u201cto suspend the statute of limitations for criminal cases where a national emergency would materially impair the functioning of the courts.\u201d\n\nKupec added that it is ultimately up to Congress to decide whether to enact these provisions into law, and that the proposed legislation would simply give additional authority to judges. \u201cIt does not confer new powers\u201d upon the Justice Department under the Trump administration, she stated.\n\nAlthough the documents seen by Politico were not available to us, the spokeswoman for the Department of Justice confirmed Politico\u2019s reporting with a statement posted to Twitter. We are therefore rating this claim \u201cTrue.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
