Some iterations of the claim say the image was leaked by the internet activist movement known as Anonymous. The photo actually portrays a model made to appear like Trump in a room that resembles the Oval Office, and was originally created as an art project by artist Alison Jackson. (Warning: links in this fact check contain explicit photographs.)\n\nExamples of the posts are visible here , here , here and here . (Some claims include genitalia that is not visible in the artist's gallery, it is unclear if this was photoshopped later by social media users.)\n\nThe photograph is the work of British artist Alison Jackson ( bit.ly/2Aq4351 ) , known for her staged portraits of celebrity lookalikes in controversial situations.\n\nThe original version visible on her website\u2019s photo gallery here . The specific photograph in this claim ( bit.ly/30tcOFY ) has the text \u201cTHIS IS NOT DONALD TRUMP\u201d written on the bottom right of the photograph.\n\nThe image was taken during a 2016 photoshoot. A video of the day can be seen here ( bit.ly/3feAT7N ) , uploaded by the artist to her YouTube channel.

The anonymous model was a \u201cteacher, musician and very conventional guy\u201d ( bit.ly/2Uv7aiV ).\n\nIn her biography visible here , Jackson describes her work as creating, through the use of \u201ccleverly styled lookalikes\u201d, images of \u201ccelebrities doing things in private\u201d and \u201cscenarios we have all imagined but never seen before\u201d.\n\nJackson told Reuters via Twitter message the picture is meant to be \u201cinvasive into Trump\u2019s privacy\u201d and plays on how audiences \u201ccan\u2019t help ourselves but want to look at other people\u2019s private lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a visual gossip\u2026 Our voyeurism is propelled into action because of the very nature of photography. Photography seduces into believing it is sure, when we know it isn\u2019t,\u201d she added.\n\nOther characters that have been subjects in her work include Bill Clinton, George Bush, Boris Johnson, Britain's Queen Elizabeth and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle (here).\n\nJackson often posts ads for lookalike models on her social media profiles, some ads are visible here , here , here , and here .\n\nFalse.
