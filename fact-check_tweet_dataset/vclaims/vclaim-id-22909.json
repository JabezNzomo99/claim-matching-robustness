The posts wrongly accuse the media of ignoring the year-old rally to make the president look bad. \n\n\n\nThe day after President Donald Trump left London following his three-day visit in the summer of 2018, there was a pro-Trump rally in the city that merged with a separate rally supporting a jailed British anti-Muslim activist who goes by the name Tommy Robinson.\n\nA video clip of that combined rally \u2014 in which the crowd chants \u201cwe love Trump\u201d after being prompted by British right-wing activist Raheem Kassam \u2014 has been circulating online recently with captions wrongly suggesting that it happened during Trump\u2019s June 2019 visit to London.\n\nA video uploaded to YouTube in July 2018 by a Russian-owned broadcasting agency shows several hours of the rally, including the chant that was used in the shortened clip.\n\nOne version of the 38-second clip that has been viewed more than 1.4 million times on Facebook was posted with a caption that says: \u201cMassive crowd in the UK chants \u2018We Love Trump\u2019 (that\u2019s funny, every report i see on TV has the SAME anti-Trump video and NOTHING about this pro-Trump video).\u201d Another version that was posted on June 4 \u2014 the second day of Trump\u2019s visit in 2019 \u2014 says: \u201cThis massive pro-Trump rally happened today but the mainstream media won\u2019t report on it.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not true. The rally shown in the clip happened on July 14, 2018, and it was reported on at the time.\n\nThe viral post echoes Trump\u2019s complaint about the media coverage during his most recent London trip. The president said he saw \u201cthousands of people on the streets cheering\u201d and only a \u201csmall protest,\u201d when in fact there were thousands of anti-Trump protesters. As we wrote, president falsely called the media coverage of the protests \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nThere were Trump supporters among the crowd of protesters during Trump\u2019s recent state visit. One Trump supporter had a milkshake thrown on him, another pierced a cartoon blimp depicting Trump, and a group of about 20 were shuffled into a pub by police separating them from the crowd of people protesting Trump\u2019s visit.\n\nEstimates of the crowd size during the June 4, 2019, protest ranged from 10,000 to 75,000, although there hasn\u2019t been an official count. London\u2019s Metropolitan Police said there were more than 3,000 police officers assigned to patrol the scene that day.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
