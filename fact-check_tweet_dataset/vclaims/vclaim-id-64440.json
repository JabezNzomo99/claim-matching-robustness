Corona is a cold\u201d and shows an excerpt from the American Medical Association Encyclopedia. Under a heading \u201cTypes of Virus\u201d, the page shows depictions of different diseases and lists the virus family with examples of related symptoms. Among the viruses listed is \u201cCoronaviruses\u201d and written next to it in the conditions column is \u201cCommon Cold.\u201d\n\nThe post includes the comment, \u201cAmerican Medical Association Encyclopedia, published 1989. Coronaviruses = common cold. Print off and put in EVERY police station letterbox or post with words, \u2018Jail Politicians\u2019 written on the back\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe July 10 post has attracted 1.1 million views and more than 520 shares.\n\nThe 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. It is a new strain in the coronavirus family \u2013 a group of viruses linked to the SARS and MERS respiratory infections and some types of common cold, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nWHO lists common symptoms of COVID-19 as fever, dry cough, and tiredness but can also \u201crange from no symptoms\u2026 to severe pneumonia or death\u201d.\n\nThe US government agency, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), lists symptoms of the common cold to include sore throat, runny nose, coughing, sneezing, headaches and body aches. The CDC also says many different respiratory viruses can cause the common cold, but rhinoviruses are the most common.\n\nThe CDC also states on its website that the \u201cvirus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.\u201d\n\nViral infectious diseases expert Professor Damian Purcell from the Doherty Institute at the University of Melbourne, says coronaviruses do cause common colds, but to circulate such a statement as contained in the Facebook post during a coronavirus pandemic is misleading.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite important when talking about this particular strain of virus, not to call it a coronavirus or coronaviruses,\u201d Prof Purcell told AAP FactCheck\n\n\u201cIt should be called SARS CoV 2, and the name means severe acute respiratory syndrome. Strictly speaking the American Medical Association in 1989 were completely correct in saying coronaviruses cause the common cold, but it\u2019s absolutely misleading to say that about SARS Covid 2.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the difference between saying something is seasonal influenza and pandemic influenza which killed millions of people.\u201d\n\nProf Purcell said while the AMA\u2019s \u201csweeping statement\u201d was true of its time, it\u2019s important to note that it was made before the SARS epidemic (2002-2003).\n\n\u201cBefore this coronaviruses were only associated with the common cold,\u201d he said.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claims in the Facebook post to be partly false. While it is true that common colds are associated with human coronaviruses, the post\u2019s claim that coronaviruses equal a common cold is not accurate. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that different respiratory viruses cause the common cold with rhinoviruses the most common. Partly False \u2013 The claims of the content are a mixture of accurate and inaccurate. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
