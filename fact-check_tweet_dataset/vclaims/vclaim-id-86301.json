As she plucks petals from her flower, she counts to 10. When she reaches 10, a male voice begins a countdown. The shot zooms into the girl\u2019s eye until, BOOM. A nuclear bomb explodes.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t mention Barry Goldwater\u2019s name, but it basically suggests that if Barry Goldwater was elected, there\u2019ll be a nuclear apocalypse and all the little children in the world will die,\u201d Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler said.\n\nNow we\u2019ve all seen an attack ad. Doom and gloom images, ominous music, and a deep voice saying the stakes are too high to vote for the other candidate. But there are other themes to be aware of as well.\n\n\u201cIf a Republican is attacking a Democrat, they\u2019re probably going to claim the person will raise your taxes or has raised your taxes,\u201d Kessler said. \u201cIf it\u2019s a Democrat attacking a Republican, they\u2019re probably going to claim that this person wants to privatize Social Security or destroy Medicare.\u201d\n\nAnd if it\u2019s an incumbent running, their ads will encourage voters to stay the course \u2014 especially if the economy is good \u2014 while challengers will preach change.\n\n\u201cThe Bush campaign both in 2000 and in 2004 had to do a counterintuitive messaging,\u201d Balz said. \u201cIn 2000, the economy was quite good, so in essence their message had to be things are good, time for a change. Which is you know totally contradictory. In 2004, Bush was far less popular because of the Iraq War. And yet what they needed to do was to say you may be unhappy but let\u2019s stay the course.\u201d\n\nSo we know how television changed campaigning and the anatomy of an attack ad, but what happened when the Internet came along?\n\n\u201cAs editing and technology becomes more sophisticated, it\u2019s easier than ever to make people look like they\u2019re saying something that they never even said in the first place,\u201d Washington Post senior producer and co-creator of the Fact Checker\u2019s guide to manipulated video Nadine Ajaka said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to alarm anyone, but the threat that\u2019s posed by fake or misleading video is pretty real. It\u2019s not hard to manipulate a video or doctor a video. And it\u2019s also not hard to have it reach millions of people,\u201d Ajaka said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that some do, but the evidence that many do or the evidence that most do is pretty hard to come by,\u201d George Washington University assistant professor Ethan Porter said.\n\nWhile it might be the case that campaign advertising can make people emotionally react to a video, there\u2019s no \u201cpowerful evidence\u201d that the reaction then translates to a change in their vote, Porter said.\n\n\u201cTo believe that, you need to believe that holding everything else constant, just that one ad was enough to cause people to change their mind either at the ballot box or to change your mind about whether or not they would turn out,\u201d Porter said. \u201cThat\u2019s a tall order. It\u2019s not impossible, but it does require skepticism.\u201d\n\u2022 None Is there a possibility that a politician\u2019s sound bite has been taken out of context and that it\u2019s maybe not the full truth?\n\u2022 None Ads are trying to convey a particular message. Does this one square with your general perception of the candidate? If not, do some research.\n\u2022 None Check the source. Campaign ads make references to sources, but some are more legitimate than others.", "lang": "en"}
