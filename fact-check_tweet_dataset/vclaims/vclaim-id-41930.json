Let\u2019s analyze the authenticity of the claim.\n\n\n\nThe image is being shared in the context of the recent protests in Assam against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2019. The bill seeks to provide Indian citizenship to specific religious groups facing religious persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan. \n\n\n\nWhen the image in the post is subjected to Google reverse image search technique, many search results of it were obtained. From the article of \u2018Asianet News\u2019, it was found that the image shows Uttar Pradesh police beating a demonstrator during protests in Lucknow demanding justice to the deceased \u2018Unnao rape victim\u2019. So, the image is in no way related to any incident in Assam.\n\nThe same information about the photograph can also be seen in the \u2018Free Press Journal\u2019 article. \n\n\n\nTo summarize, an image of UP police beating a demonstrator during protests demanding justice to the deceased \u2018Unnao rape victim\u2019 is being shared with a false narrative. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
