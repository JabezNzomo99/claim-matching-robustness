This will cost every household in the U.S. $95. And by the way, Trump is borrowing the money from China since his tax cuts blew a trillion dollar hole in the deficit. Does this feel like winning yet?\"\n\nThe post has generated a lot of discussion on Facebook \u2014 more than 43,000 reactions and 126,000 shares \u2014 so we decided to fact-check it.\n\nIt turns out that the post distorts information about how the aid package is being funded.\n\nLet\u2019s break down each claim in the graphic, one by one.\n\nIt\u2019s true that U.S. Department of Agriculture did recently \"authorize up to $12 billion in programs,\" according to a recent press release.\n\nThat money is meant to help farmers who were hurt as a result of China increasing its tariffs in retaliation to Trump\u2019s increase in tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nHowever, one expert we reached out to took issue with the emergency aid package being dubbed a \"bailout.\"\n\n\"I would not use the term \u2018bailout\u2019 \u2026 since the term connotes the recipients will be compensated for actions they took,\" said Steve Suppan, a senior policy analyst at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy.\n\nIn the past, we\u2019ve referred to monetary aid packages to Wall Street entities and the auto industry as \"bailouts.\" That\u2019s because those companies were being compensated for risky mistakes they made.\n\nBut unlike those Wall Street workers and automobile companies, \"farmers did not initiate the U.S. tariffs that triggered the Chinese and other tariffs,\" Suppan said.\n\n\"This will cost every household in the U.S. $95\"\n\nIn tackling this claim, we began with a bit of math.\n\nTrump\u2019s relief package authorizes up to $12 billion of aid. Divided by the 126 million U.S. households (as reported by the market and consumer data website Statista.com), that works out to roughly $95 per household.\n\nSo from a very simple standpoint, the math checks out.\n\nBut the experts we talked to agreed that the $95-per-household figure has its limits, and won\u2019t affect every taxpayer the same.\n\n\"The $12 billion must either come from reduced government spending, higher taxes or increased debt,\" said Aaron Smith, a professor of agricultural and resource economics at the University of California, Davis. \"Increased debt suggests that future households will pay for it in the form of higher taxes, reduced spending or higher inflation. Households pay tax at different rates and they would be affected differently by \u2026 what, if any, reductions in spending occurred.\"\n\nBrian Wright, a professor of agricultural economics at University of California, Berkeley, agreed that the monetary burden is likely to be distributed unevenly.\n\nHe told us it will probably \"fall more on the younger part of the population (since they) will have to deal with the deficit for some time.\"\n\n\"Trump is borrowing the money from China\"\n\nFrom there, the post gets more interesting. Would the package spurred by Chinese retaliatory tariffs be financed by money borrowed from China?\n\nThe USDA press release specified that the authority required to administer and fund the aid package comes from a piece of legislation known as the Community Credit Corporation Charter Act.\n\nThe Community Credit Corporation has the authority to borrow up to $30 billion from the U.S. Treasury for this purpose, an amount that more than covers the $12 billion aid package.\n\nThe Facebook group may have been referring to the fact that China holds the most Treasury securities of any foreign country.\n\nTreasury securities can be purchased by both individuals and other entities, like foreign governments. When someone purchases a Treasury bond or a note, they\u2019re agreeing to hand over their money to the federal government in return for being handed back that same amount at a later date. In between their initial purchase of the bond or note, the purchaser is paid interest at a predetermined rate.\n\nBecause these debt obligations are backed by the U.S. government, many foreign countries purchase a large amount of Treasury securities, since they\u2019re relatively safe investments.\n\nChina, in particular, buys them in order to depreciate its own currency and make its exports cheaper.\n\nBut it\u2019s inaccurate to suggest the aid package is financed specifically by Chinese purchases of Treasury securities.\n\nThat\u2019s because the revenues generated from bond sales \"go into the general fund that finances all U.S. government activity,\" said Suppan, the trade policy analyst.\n\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s another logical flaw to consider.\n\n\"It can't be that current households will pay for this bailout and the money will come from increased borrowing from China,\" Smith of UC-Davis said. \"It must be one or the other.\"\n\nAfter looking at the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s records of the federal deficit by year, we found this claim to be inaccurate.\n\nThe last time the federal deficit exceeded one trillion was in 2012, when it was $1.087 trillion.\n\nThe CBO projects that the 2018 deficit will be $804 billion. That\u2019s a step up from 2017\u2019s deficit, which was $665.4 billion.\n\nIn saying that Trump\u2019s tax cut legislation \"blew a trillion dollar hole in the deficit,\" it\u2019s likely that The Other 98% was referring to a report released by the CBO after the legislation was passed that projected the deficit would rise to over $1 trillion by 2020.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t happened yet, so the post is imprecise in using the past tense when saying that the tax cuts \"blew\" a \"hole in the deficit.\"\n\nThe Other 98% did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA recent Facebook post calls Trump\u2019s recent announcement of an emergency aid package to farmers a \"bailout.\" It also claims that the package will cost each household $95, and Trump borrowed money to finance it from China because his tax cuts left a trillion dollar hole in the deficit.\n\nThe USDA did recently announce a $12 billion aid package for farmers, but some would consider the labeling of it as a \"bailout\" to be misleading since farmers were not responsible for the tariffs and other factors that led to the aid package being necessary.\n\nIt\u2019s also not fair to declare that the package would cost each household $95, since different households pay taxes at different rates.\n\nIn addition, the government isn\u2019t directly borrowing the money to finance the aid package from China. They\u2019re borrowing the money from the U.S. Treasury. China buys and owns Treasury securities, but those securities have a very remote connection to the aid package.\n\nLastly, the federal deficit hasn\u2019t been over $1 trillion since 2012. The CBO doesn\u2019t project it to be over $1 trillion until 2020.\n\nWe rate the claims in the post Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
