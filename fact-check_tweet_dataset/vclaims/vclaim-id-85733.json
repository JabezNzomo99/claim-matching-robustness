It referred to stories that were fabrications \u2014 the Clinton Foundation paying for Chelsea Clinton\u2019s wedding or a child sex ring run out of a D.C. pizza shop. The phrase was popularized after Google, Facebook and Twitter vowed to eliminate the phony content that some have speculated helped tilt the 2016 election in Donald Trump\u2019s favor.\n\nBut then, on Jan. 11, 2017, then President-elect Trump told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta, \u201cYou\u2019re fake news,\u201d while responding to Acosta\u2019s shouted questions. Since then, according to our friends at PolitiFact, Trump used the term more than 153 times in 2017, often referring to negative press coverage as \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters applaud his willingness to combat what he sees as unfair or biased reporting. But there has been a second-order effect as well. What has Trump\u2019s usage of \u201cfake news\u201d meant to the world\u2019s discourse over the last year? Let\u2019s take a look (and watch the video above.)\n\nA Politico investigation found that no foreign leader had used \u201cfake news\u201d before 2017. A year later, it is a different story. Leaders across the globe have followed Trump\u2019s lead, invoking \u201cfake news\u201d to bat down unfavorable coverage or undermine reporting. Often, they use language identical to the Trump administration\u2019s. Here\u2019s a sampling:\n\u2022 None Burma: The : The United Nation Human Rights Commission estimates that more than half a million Rohingya have fled Burma as a result of systematic military attacks. Asked about the Rohingya refugee crisis, a Burmese government official said: \u201cThere are no such thing as Rohingya. It\u2019s fake news.\u201d\n\u2022 None Libya: After a CNN report showed migrants being sold into slavery, Libyan officials After a CNN report showed migrants being sold into slavery, Libyan officials used a tweet by President Trump calling the network \u201cfake news\u201d in an attempt to discredit the story.\n\u2022 None Singapore: Officials in Singapore Officials in Singapore introduced legislation that would allow government to have the power to force articles they deem \u201cfake news\u201d to be removed. In theory this could help combat the kinds of stories that initially generated the term \u201cfake news,\u201d but Singapore is known for tightly controlling the media.\n\u2022 None Spain: Spanish national police clashed with voters in Catalonia ahead of their independence referendum. Despite photos and video of the violence, Spanish national police clashed with voters in Catalonia ahead of their independence referendum. Despite photos and video of the violence, Spain\u2019s foreign minister attempted to quash their legitimacy, saying, \u201cthere have been a lot of alternative facts and fake news here.\u201d\n\u2022 None Syria: In : In an interview with Yahoo! News , President Bashar al-Assad was presented with data from an Amnesty International report that alleged serious human rights abuses in one of the country\u2019s prisons. Assad responded by saying not only is the organization unreliable, but telling the reporter, \u201cAs you know, we\u2019re in a fake news era.\u201d\n\nHistorically, many of these countries have significantly less press freedom than the United States. And in some places, \u201cfake news\u201d is now a considered a criminal offense. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 262 journalists were imprisoned in 2017 \u2014 the most since the organization started tracking in 2000. Of those, at least 21 journalists were imprisoned for \u201cfalse news.\u201d\n\nHowever, the spread of \u201cfake news\u201d isn\u2019t solely responsible for this. Press freedoms have been declining globally for the past decade, according to Freedom House, an independent watchdog.\n\nU.S. presidents are held up as examples on the world stage. For the past several decades, they have aggressively pushed for human rights and free press, while critiquing countries that don\u2019t share these values. Past presidents have pushed free press \u2014 regardless of the type of coverage they receive.\n\nTrump shifted this rhetoric. His willingness to dismiss negative news coverage as \u201cfake\u201d appears to have opened the door for leaders of other countries to follow suit.", "lang": "en"}
