(The other mention was about using export partnerships to create jobs.) Considering the breakneck growth of China\u2019s economy, the claim piqued our curiosity.\n\nA White House spokesman said the comment referred to the , a survey of corporate executives from 302 companies in 28 countries that measured where companies are looking to make global investments. The top highlight: The United States took the No. 1 spot for the first time since 2001.\n\nNote: A.T. Kearney did not conduct a survey in 2011\n\nThis index -- in its 13th edition since 1998 -- is not a measure of actual dollars being brought in, but rather the confidence global companies have investing in certain nations in the future.\n\nA.T. Kearney, a global management consulting firm, said in its June 2013 report that foreign direct investment -- injecting money into a country\u2019s economy by either buying a company or expanding an existing company -- in the United States is still down from the 2008 high of $306 billion, bringing in $167.7 billion in 2012.\n\nThe index\u2019s outlook is based on business leaders\u2019 attitudes toward political, economic and regulatory changes and their potential effects on foreign investments. Corporate, regional and local business managers responding to the survey said China\u2019s rising labor costs and focus on shifting to a consumer economy took some of the shine off the economic powerhouse, although 73 percent of the respondents said they would maintain holdings in the country.\n\nMeanwhile, partisan brinksmanship in the U.S. government made investors wary, but they were optimistic thanks to a favorable dollar, a slow but steady recovery and increasing U.S. manufacturing productivity. In all, 63 percent of respondents expected some growth in America\u2019s economy. Even as the survey was taken amid the 2012 elections and budget fight, the U.S. was considered \"a bedrock of stability among developed nations,\" the 2013 index report said.\n\nIs saying the U.S. is now the \"No. 1 place to invest\" an accurate portrayal of the results? A.T. Kearney director of communications Doug MacDonald said yes.\n\n\"In terms of our index, it does,\" he told PolitiFact. \"Ours actually asks business leaders what markets they\u2019re looking forward to investing in.\"\n\nBut what about other indices?\n\nA comparable study -- albeit with different measurement criteria -- is the Milken Institute\u2019s , which lists the United States as 22nd among 98 countries. That study tracked nations\u2019 abilities to attract foreign direct investment by measuring factors across \"economic fundamentals, regulatory barriers, ease of doing business, regulatory quality, and the rule of law.\" Released in March 2013, the Milken Institute\u2019s report was created with 2011 data, and lists China as No. 1.\n\nThere are also similar rankings from business media outlets. In December, Forbes ranked the United States 14th out of 145 nations in its \" \" list. The annual rating placed Hong Kong at No. 3 and Ireland at No. 1, based on \"11 different metrics including property rights, innovation, taxes, technology, corruption, freedom (personal, trade and monetary), red tape, investor protection and stock market performance.\"\n\nBloomberg rated the United States second, behind leader Hong Kong, in its own \" .\" That ranking, based on \"six broad criteria that included the cost of starting a business, the cost of labor and materials and the cost of moving goods,\" placed China a distant 24th.\n\nObama said that \"for the first time in over a decade, business leaders around the world have declared that China is no longer the world\u2019s No. 1 one place to invest; America is.\"\n\nHe was referring to the 2013 A.T. Kearney Foreign Direct Investment Confidence Index, which surveys global business leaders to determine their investment attitudes toward nations across the world. The United States did top the list this year, for the first time since 2001, knocking China out of the top slot.\n\nThe president is accurate by citing one particular study, and that study did ask business leaders what they thought about investing in the United States. A broader look at other rankings doesn\u2019t make the United States seem like such a powerhouse, even if it does still best China in some lists.
