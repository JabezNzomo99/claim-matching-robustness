A Kroger spokesperson confirmed that the receipt is fake.\n\nThe image appears to show a receipt from Kroger showing a purchase of 2% milk for $2.39. Below that charge is a \u201cBLM charge\u201d of 59 cents circled in red, seemingly referring to the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\n\u201cAll my Indiana friends. Look what Kroger is doing,\u201d reads the Facebook post\u2019s text.

If Kroger was doing so, major media outlets would have reported it, yet none have, except for fact-checkers debunking the claim. A Kroger spokesperson told The Associated Press that the image was a \u201cdupe.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incorrect. Absolutely photoshopped. It\u2019s actually a dupe of another receipt that was circulating online earlier this week,\u201d Kristal Howard, The Kroger Company\u2019s head of corporate communications and media relations, told The Associated Press.\n\nThe receipt originally showed a 59 cent charge for a \u201cchange shortage,\u201d not a \u201cBLM charge,\u201d according to PolitiFact. The federal reserve is currently facing a coin shortage due to the coronavirus pandemic, so Kroger is asking customers to pay with a debit or credit card, have their remaining change loaded onto their store loyalty card or donate their change to charity, per Kroger\u2019s statement to Coin World.\n\nKroger has issued a statement on Twitter supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, stating that is the company\u2019s \u201cresponsibility to better support our Black associates, customers and allies.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a company, it\u2019s our responsibility to better support our Black associates, customers and allies,\u201d reads the tweet. \u201cWe know there is more work to do and will keep you updated on our progress, this is only the beginning.
