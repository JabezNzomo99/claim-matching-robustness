There is a verified BBC Breaking News account which has the blue tick next to it.\n\nThe Twitter handle is also a giveaway: the fake account is @BBCbreaki while the real account is @BBCBreaking.\n\nThe post was retweeted hundreds of times before being deleted, including by verified journalists in Canada and Australia.\n\nAs of the morning of 7 April, Michael Gove confirmed the Prime Minister is still in hospital.", "lang": "en"}
