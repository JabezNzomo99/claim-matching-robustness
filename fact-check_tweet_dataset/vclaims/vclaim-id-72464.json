Hall Jr. made his biggest splash in a Dec. 6, 2014, speech accepting the Torch of Freedom award from Texans for Fiscal Responsibility by saying the House speaker, Joe Straus, separately told Gov. Rick Perry, who appointed Hall to the board, that he would drop the House\u2019s pressure on Hall if Hall just quit the board -- an offer that Straus spokesman Jason Embry subsequently said did not happen .\n\nOur attention was drawn by .\n\nAfter saying his own questions about \"unusual admissions\" practices at UT led to a special House committee\u2019s impeachment proceedings, Hall added: \"And this quote from the speaker of the House before a large audience: \u2018I do not care if Wallace Hall swings from a tree.\u2019 This from the same speaker who claims his job is not to protect the citizens, but his (House) members.\n\n\"Of course, he did not attempt to confront me personally,\" Hall said. \"Does that seem odd to you? Instead he set up an experimental investigative committee to force me to quit and, failing that, destroy my reputation.\" Hall said he also was threatened with investigations by the Department of Public Safety and FBI and is waiting, like his wife and children, to see if he\u2019s indicted in Travis County.\n\nThat tree-swinging mention struck us as provocative enough to verify.\n\nHall offered no comment in response to our emailed inquiries nor did Straus engage.\n\nFrom an online search, though, we learned that Straus talked about Hall and a tree in a public interview during the 2013 Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.\n\nIn the Sept. 28, 2013, interview, Straus described his expectations of a special House panel formed to consider leveling impeachment charges against Hall. In August 2014, that panel censured and admonished Hall, listing his relentless demands for records from UT-Austin, his handling of confidential student records and his efforts to oust the university\u2019s president, Bill Powers, who later announced his plans to step down. Hall\u2019s defenders, including Perry, say he has simply exercised his oversight duties as a regent.\n\nAs of mid-December 2014, Hall remained under investigation by the Travis County district attorney\u2019s Public Integrity Unit, in part for his handling of confidential student information.\n\nStraus said in the 2013 interview: \"I want a fair, thorough, complete investigation. ...Wherever the trail leads, that\u2019s where we\u2019ll go.\"\n\nOur transcript picks up with Tribune reporter Jay Root:\n\nROOT: \"What have you heard about the allegations against Wallace Hall that either just don\u2019t disturb you, that think that it\u2019s even appropriate to even be talking about?...\"\n\nSTRAUS: \"I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to prejudge what the committee and the investigation is going to turn up. And I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t want to say I don\u2019t care. But I have, I have no bias here. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t care whether they, whether they give the guy a medal of honor or hang him from a tree. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, I have no idea.\n\nROOT: \"Hang him from a tree, really?\" (crowd laughter)\n\nSTRAUS: \"Well, you know, not literally. But my point is whether the report is harshly critical and leads to some impeachable offense and makes that recommendation or whether it says Wallace Hall is the greatest... regent that\u2019s ever been in the history of Texas, hands off, give him some kind of resolution in his honor. I don\u2019t know. And I\u2019m not gonna know until the investigation is complete.\"\n\nAccording to Hall, Straus said, \"I do not care if Wallace Hall swings from a tree.\"\n\nStraus said close to that, but he said in the same breath he\u2019d likewise be open to a special panel deciding Hall deserved to be honored. Overall, the speaker made it clear he wasn\u2019t judging Hall in advance of the committee\u2019s review -- which is hardly how Hall characterized Straus' attitude.\n\nWith all this detail available in the online video of the Straus interview, Hall\u2019s statement shakes out as incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!\n\nPANTS ON FIRE \u2013 The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.\n\nClick here for on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
