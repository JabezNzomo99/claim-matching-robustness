Mike Coffman \u00ad(R-Colo.) about whether he was doing enough to change the agency\u2019s culture. Until McDonald\u2019s TV interview, fewer than a dozen employees and senior executives were known to have been removed from their posts.\n\nTwo days after McDonald took office, Congress passed legislation allowing more veterans to seek private care outside the VA system and authorizing McDonald to expedite disciplinary actions for senior executives. It was notoriously difficult to fire senior executives at the VA \u2014 which terminated executives at one-fourth the firing rate for all federal agencies from 2008 to 2013, according to CNN \u2014 and the goal was to allow the VA chief to replace bad actors quickly, especially ones connected to the scandal.\n\nDisciplinary actions for 75 employees have been proposed since June 3, 2014, according to the VA\u2019s most recent weekly briefing to the House and Senate committees on veterans affairs. These actions were related to patient scheduling, record manipulation, appointment delays and/or patient deaths. The proposed actions included removals, admonishment (a written letter of censure), reprimand (a stronger letter of censure), suspension of less than two weeks and probationary termination. Admonishment or reprimand letters can be removed from employees\u2019 personnel files after two or three years. (Definitions for disciplinary actions are here.)\n\nOf the 75 employees, only eight employees have actually been removed, as of Feb. 13, 2015. Twenty-three cases were pending. Five employees resigned before a decision was made on their case. Others were demoted, were on probationary termination, had some other disciplinary action, or had no action taken at all.\n\nMcDonald used his new personnel authority to propose removals of five executives \u2014 in Phoenix, Georgia, central Alabama, Pittsburgh and the VA central area office in Washington. Two retired before they could be removed, and three were actually fired. But of those three terminations, only one was officially related to the VA scandal \u2014 James Talton, director of Central Alabama\u2019s VA.\n\nPhoenix VA\u2019s Sharon Helman, whose hospital was at the center of the scandal and who was found to have known of data-manipulation problems for at least two years, was placed on administrative leave for seven months and eventually fired for inappropriately accepting gifts. Pittsburgh VA\u2019s Terry Gerigk Wolf was removed for \u201cconduct unbecoming a senior executive\u201d and wasteful spending.\n\nAs for the 900 employees being fired since mid-2014, Hutton said those employees have been fired for cause \u201ceither through removal action or during a probationary period.\u201d Most of the 900 employees were with the Veterans Health Administration, and vary in location, pay grades and reasons, Hutton said. Reasons include poor performance and absenteeism.\n\n[Update: A breakdown of the 900 \u201cfirings\" published by PolitiFact shows about half of the employees in this count were terminations of probationary employees who have been at the VA for less than a year. It is unclear how those employees can be \u201cheld accountable\" for a scandal that has existed for years before they were hired by the agency.]\n\nThe VA is the largest non-military Cabinet agency, with more than 340,000 employees as of September 2014. That means even if 900 employees were fired, they accounted for less than 0.3 percent of all VA employees. Plus, in fiscal year 2013, there were 2,247 VA employees fired in one year, which was two and half times more than McDonald\u2019s 900 figure \u2014 and that was before a massive systemic problem was found. (Thanks to data editor Ted Mellnik for crunching the numbers.)\n\nRecommending people to receive a letter about their wrongdoing is not the same thing as being fired. Recommending people to be fired is not the same thing as being fired. Employees are not fired unless they have been removed from their jobs \u2014 and as of two days before McDonald went on the air, there were eight employees who were removed for manipulating patient wait-time data. So McDonald\u2019s statement is incorrect.\n\nThe 900-employee figure does not have much meaning in this context, given the size of the agency and the focus on holding senior executives accountable. Only three of the five executives he proposed for removal using his new authority were actually removed, and the other two were forced into retirement. Five top executives leaving their posts in six months is a record pace for the VA, but only one was officially removed in relation to the scandal. Whether resigning under pressure should be counted as being \u201cheld accountable\u201d or being fired \u2014 well, McDonald may know better about that himself.", "lang": "en"}
