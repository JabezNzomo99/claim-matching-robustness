Some of these claims are false, while others are misleading, public health experts tell AFP.\n\nThe posts, shared thousands of times in the US and Canada since May 2020, list a number of risk associated with mask wearing including: \u201creduces oxygen up to 60%,\u201d \u201cincreases risk of CO2 poisoning,\u201d and \u201ccauses increased face-touching.\u201d Similar claims have also been posted in Spanish.\n\nVinita Dubey, Associate Medical Officer of Health at Toronto Public Health, told AFP via email that, if worn correctly, a cloth mask is unlikely to reduce oxygen enough that the wearer would pass out.\n\n\u201cIn general, a cloth mask does not fit tightly to the face. Air can still go around the mask as well as through the pores in the material,\u201d while acting as a barrier to small virus particles, she said.\n\nThe claim that masks cause an oxygen deficiency (hypoxia) was disproved in a separate AFP fact-check.\n\nThe claim that wearing a mask \u201cincreases risk of CO2 poisoning\u201d was also refuted by Dubey.\n\n\u201cProlonged use of a face mask, including the N95, has not been shown to cause carbon dioxide toxicity in healthy people. If CO2 slowly builds up in the mask over time, the levels are low and mostly tolerable,\u201d Dubey said.\n\nN95 masks used by health care workers are designed to have a very tight fitting.\n\nHowever, there can be specific circumstances where \u201csome individuals may not be comfortable wearing a mask. Anxiety or panic may lead to hyperventilation (rapid breathing) which can cause the CO2 levels to drop and symptoms of lightheadedness, dizziness and confusion,\u201d Dubey added.\n\nThe post also claims that wearing a mask \u201cincreases face touching.\u201d\n\nHyo-Jick Choi, Assistant Professor at the University of Alberta\u2019s Chemical and Materials Engineering Department, said he is not aware of any study that directly correlates wearing a mask with increased face touching.\n\nChoi told AFP via email that \u201cwhether you wear a mask or not, face touching can either infect an individual by the contaminated hands, or transmit disease by the contaminated masks and cause infections.\u201d\n\nBoth Choi and Dubey were clear that users should not touch their masks after putting them on.\n\nDubey stressed that \u201ca mask should fit comfortably and be easy to breathe to avoid frequent adjustments of the mask while using it.\u201d\n\nThe post also claims that \u201cviruses and bacteria saturate the outside\u201d of the mask.\n\nChoi said, \u201cit depends on the risk level of the environments, the time spent and where the mask has been exposed to.\u201d\n\nHealth Canada guidelines state that \u201cif you plan to reuse the mask, wash it before wearing it again.\u201d\n\nFinally, the post claims that \u201ccontaminants sit within mask fibers, get reinhaled.\u201d This is misleading.\n\nChoi explained that \u201crespiratory diseases are transmitted by virus/bacteria-carrying droplets. Face masks are used to prevent the transmission of those pathogens-carrying droplets (i.e. contaminants),\u201d and it is unlikely that these would be \u201creinhaled\u201d as claimed in the post.\n\n\u201cIf the pathogen-carrying droplets (from large droplets to small aerosols) are produced by human activities such as sneezing, coughing, and speaking, then the virus-carrying droplets would have a composition similar to saliva. In this case, pathogens on the mask surface may not be easily released from fibers because of the high viscosity of the contaminant.\u201d\n\nHealth Canada cautions, however, that homemade masks \u201cmay not provide complete protection against virus-sized particles.\u201d\n\nHowever, the agency, along with the CDC, continues to recommend that face masks or face coverings be used in situations where social distancing is difficult to maintain.", "lang": "en"}
