Prof Peacock told MPs that a home testing kit to check if you have had the new coronavirus could be available from retailers like Amazon and Boots in a matter of days. However, this timeline has been disputed by medical experts and politicians who insist more time is needed to ensure the tests work.\n\nAt an appearance before the science and technology committee on 25 March, Prof Peacock described an antibody test that is in development that will allow people to check if they have already had Covid-19. She said the tests, which could be done at home, would be evaluated that week to ensure they work properly. Once this is done, they will be \u201cdistributed into the community\u201d and available to buy from Amazon or Boots.\n\nShe told MPs she anticipated the evaluation of these tests should be completed \u201cby the end of this week\u201d, and that in the \u201cnear future\u201d people will be able to purchase the tests. Asked if she\u2019s talking about a \u201csmall number of days rather than weeks or months\u201d for the tests to be available, Prof Peacock responded: \u201cYes, absolutely.\u201d\n\nHowever, at the government\u2019s daily Covid-19 news conference later the same day, Chief Medical Officer Chris Witty disputed this account and insisted the focus was currently on ensuring the tests work properly.\n\n\u201cThe key thing for us to do is now to evaluate are these tests accurate enough to be used by the general public. And if the answer is they\u2019re all incredibly accurate then we will work out the most quick and effective way to release these,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI do not think, and I want to be clear, that this is something we\u2019ll suddenly be ordering on the internet next week.\u201d\n\nIn an interview on BBC Breakfast on 26 March, health minister Edward Argar said \u201cgood progress\u201d was being made with the evaluation of the tests, but he didn\u2019t want to be \u201cpremature in setting a specific date when it will be ready\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hopeful we\u2019ll be able to do it very quickly but I don\u2019t want to set an artificial timeline.\u201d\n\nBoots have also responded to the claims on Twitter, saying: \u201cWe are keen to work with the government to explore opportunities to support Covid-19 testing and to support the NHS in any way we can. However we do not have any type of Covid-19 tests in our stores. Customers should not make a trip to a Boots store or pharmacy for this purpose.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
