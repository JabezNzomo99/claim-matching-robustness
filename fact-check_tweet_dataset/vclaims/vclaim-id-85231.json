During the afternoon on Election Day, Brooks announced that he planned on challenging election results and charged that 11 voting machines \u201cat one time or another during the day would not register Mo Brooks\u2019 votes.\u201d\n\nA month later, the county requested the FBI to investigate Election Day irregularities in Brooks\u2019s district. But there is no evidence the FBI conducted an investigation or, if it did, whether it found that anyone (Democrat or otherwise) had tampered with the machines. Brooks\u2019s office did not respond to our repeated requests for more evidence.\n\nState investigative agencies and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office had no record of this investigation or its findings. News clippings from 1982 and 1983 reviewed by the Huntsville-Madison County Public Library and the Alabama Department of Archives and History had no reference to any investigative findings, either.\n\nIn fact, Alabama was one of three states the Justice Department placed under its watch in 1982 for potential voting rights violations or discrimination against black voters. There were nearly 200 federal observers at Alabama polling places on Election Day.\n\n\u201cHad there been any bona fides to the allegation, we would have investigated and prosecuted it, if it had merit. But based on the fact that I don\u2019t recall that, I would have to conclude that there was no validity to the complaint,\u201d said Frohsin, who was interviewed for a 1982 Huntsville Times article about the irregularities.\n\nVoting machines at the time had one lever for a straight-ticket vote and levers for individual races. The individual levers would sometimes malfunction, Frohsin said. News clippings show that some of the problematic machines were fixed by the afternoon on Election Day.\n\n\u201cThe Voting Rights Act had singled out states in the South, and we were cognizant of that. We were not going to have any hanky-panky going on in the polling areas,\u201d Frohsin said.\n\nAfter our inquiry, Brooks told AL.com that the Alabama Bureau of Investigation confirmed that voting machines were not counting votes for him but could not find who was at fault. The agency could not provide The Fact Checker any record of this investigation.\n\n[Update: On Feb. 7, 2017, Brooks criticized our fact-check on the House floor and claimed, \u201cI proudly wear the Washington Post Four Pinocchios like a red badge of courage.\u201d On Election Day 1982, Brooks talked with witnesses and examined documents, and found the 11 machines registered votes for all candidates on the ballot except for himself, he said.\n\nBrooks did not offer proof that Democrats rigged the machines, but said he the odds that 11 machines would not record votes just for his name, as the only Republican candidate, \u201care one chance out of 26 to the 11th power, or one chance out of 3.6 quadrillion chances. Conversely, the probability that these 11 voting machines were rigged is 3.6 quadrillion to one. The evidence is overwhelming.\u201d]\n\nBrooks claimed Democrats rigged a quarter of the voting machines in his 1982 election, but there is no evidence to support such a claim. Some voters reported problems with voting machines that day, but there\u2019s no record that an investigation turned up rigged machines or any Democrats responsible for it.\n\nMemories may fade and change over time, and perhaps Brooks made the claim in the confidence of a private meeting. But it\u2019s irresponsible to make a claim about a politically charged topic like this without the evidence to back it up. We don\u2019t know how often Brooks has been telling this apparently tall tale, but it\u2019s time to retire it.", "lang": "en"}
