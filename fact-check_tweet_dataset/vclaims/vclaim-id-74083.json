No, that's not true: Sen. Harris did tell a radio show host that she listened to Snoop and Tupac when she got high on marijuana, but she did not specifically say it was while she was in college.\n\nThe claim appeared as a meme in a post (archived here) shared on Facebook on February 12, 2019, under the title \"This is why we don't vote for Kamala Harris! That's all it takes for me! Bye bye \". It opened:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nIn case this meme is taken offline, this is a screenshot:\n\nHarris graduated from Howard University in 1986 and then attended law school in California, graduating from there in 1989. Her college days came up when the then-presidential candidate was interviewed on iHeart Radio's The Breakfast Club morning show in February 2019. About 38 minutes into the interview, Harris was asked about her experiences with marijuana:\n\nHost: Have you ever smoked? Harris: I have, and I inhaled. I did inhale It was a long time ago, but yes. I just broke loose. Host: See I like stuff like that, that's a real honest answer. Was it a blunt or a joint? Host: Do you remember the high? Host: So, if it was legalized all throughout the country, and medicinal would you do it? Harris: Listen, I think that it gives a lot of people joy and we need more joy.\n\nYou can see that exchange here:\n\nAfter a brief discussion about if Harris took political contributions from big banks, the conversation turned to music choices:\n\nHost: What were you listening to when you were high? What was on? What song? Harris: Oh, my goodness. Oh, yeah, definitely Snoop, uh huh, Tupac, for sure, for sure. Harris: You know who I really love is Cardi B. I really do. I really do.\n\nYou can see that exchange here:\n\nIf Harris had said she ONLY smoked marijuana while in college, this meme would be accurate. But she never said that. Her reference to Snoop and Tupac was about music choices when she was \"high,\" not specifically about when she was \"high in college.\"", "lang": "en"}
