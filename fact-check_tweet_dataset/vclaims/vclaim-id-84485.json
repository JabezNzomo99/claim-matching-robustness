Alt News had previous written about how a video was circulated as a Hindu man being killed by Muslims in Nawada, Bihar. The same video was then made viral as a Hindu man being killed by Muslims in West Bengal. The same video is now being circulated a third time as a CRPF Jawan being killed by Kashmiri students.\n\nThe image above shows how this message was circulated on WhatsApp and made its way to Facebook. Just this one post has been shared more than 35,000 times on Facebook. The text of the WhatsApp message says:\n\nTranslation: Just a little while ago, a friend of mine who studies in Srinagar sent this video. This is today\u2019s video. Please make sure that it reaches news channels. Kashmiri Students are beating up a CRPF Jawan. Friends, for the sake of humanity, I plead before you to send this video to as many groups as possible so that every news channel covers this video by this evening.\n\nMany other people shared this video on their personal timelines.\n\nThe video also made its way to YouTube with same narration as seen on Facebook/WhatsApp posts.\n\nWhat is the truth? On April 1, 2017, unknown assailants killed Abu Syed and seriously injured Md Ali, two men who were wanted for the murder of Awami League leader Monir Hossain Sarkar. This incident happened in Titas subdivision of Coomilla district in Bangladesh. The issue was also covered by the local news website called Coomilla-r-Kagoj which translates to \u201cCoomilla\u2019s Newspaper\u201d.\n\nThe video of the incident was uploaded by a Bangladeshi resident to Youtube on April 2nd.\n\nOne might ask, how is that the same video becomes viral over and over again with different narratives? The reason is that there is no one to reach the truth to the people. There\u2019s a raging epidemic of fake videos but no one wants to do anything about it. Those who own big newspapers and big TV channels do not consider it their responsibility to inform their viewers about these fake videos. Facebook Inc that owns both Facebook and WhatsApp platforms doesn\u2019t want to take up the responsibility either. And the Government? Well, less said, the better.", "lang": "en"}
