Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: American Army band is playing Indian National Anthem in preparation for Modi\u2019s \u2018Howdy, Modi!\u2019 event in Houston. Fact: The video indeed has the American Army band playing the Indian National Anthem. But the Indian National Anthem was played during the \u2018Yudh Abhyas 2019\u2019 Exercise. So, the claim that this is done in the preparation for the Howdy Modi event is FALSE.\n\nThe video from ANI clearly mentions that the band\u2019s performance was at Yudh Abhyas 2019. Yudh Abhyas is a joint military exercise between India and the US is hosted alternatively between two countries. This was the 15th edition of \u2018Yudh Abhyas\u2019.\n\nHere\u2019s a screenshot of the video\u2019s description from ANI\u2019s website:\n\nTo conclude, American Army band playing Indian National Anthem during the Exercise \u2018Yudh Abhyas 2019\u2019 at Joint Base Lewis, McChord is shared as USA will be playing Indian National Anthem on Modiji\u2019s arrival at \u2018Howdy Modi!\u2019, Texas.", "lang": "en"}
