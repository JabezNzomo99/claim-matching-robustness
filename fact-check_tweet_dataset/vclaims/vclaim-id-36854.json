An Australian photographer, not NASA, created the image.\n\nAustralians have been battling wildfires across the country since September 2019, with the states of New South Wales and Victoria being the most severely affected. The fires have killed at least 28 people and, in New South Wales alone, damaged or destroyed more than 2,000 homes, reported CNN.\n\nA number of social media users have shared alleged images of the wildfires in an effort to raise awareness for the ongoing natural disaster. One image circulating widely on Facebook claims to show a NASA photograph of the Australian wildfires taken from space.\n\nThrough a reverse image search, the Daily Caller News Foundation discovered the supposed satellite image does not come from NASA but rather Anthony Hearsey, a Brisbane-based photographer and graphic designer. He created the digital image and posted it on Instagram Jan. 5.\n\n\u201cThis is a 3D visualisation (sic) of the hotspots in Australia. NOT A PHOTO. Think of this as a graph,\u201d Hearsey wrote on Instagram. \u201cAlso note this was created as an art piece.\u201d (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show A Baby Koala Rescued From The Australian Wildfires By A Golden Retriever)\n\nHearsey used NASA\u2019s Fire Information for Resource Management Systems (FIRMS) data from Dec. 5, 2019, to Jan. 5, 2020, to create the digital visualization, per his website. FIRMS tracks wildfires around the world in near real-time.\n\n\u201cScale is a little exaggerated due to the render\u2019s glow, but generally true to the info from the NASA website,\u201d Hearsey states on his website. \u201cAlso note that NOT all the areas are still burning, and this is a compilation.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
