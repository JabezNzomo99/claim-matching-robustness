These account for over \u00a310 billion and aren\u2019t necessarily always what you might consider tax dodging.\n\nAnd some elements of the tax gap definitely aren\u2019t tax dodging. For example, \u00a33.1 billion is put down to human error, despite people taking reasonable care.\n\nAlso it shouldn\u2019t be assumed that if HMRC managed to get the tax gap down from \u00a331 billion to \u00a30, that the government would automatically receive \u00a331 billion more in income.\n\nFor example, a business owner may evade \u00a31,000 of VAT payments, but with that \u00a31,000 may buy a television which they otherwise would not have. This purchase would generate VAT, and also, indirectly, other taxes paid by the company selling the television.\n\nHow big is the tax gap?\n\nMs Sultana\u2019s figure appears to refer to an unofficial estimate of the total \u201ctax gap\u201d calculated by Richard Murphy who runs the website Tax Research UK.\n\nAgain, this is an estimate of the entire tax gap, not just the portion that is \u201cdodged\u201d, and not just the portion that relates to large businesses and the super-rich.\n\nWe\u2019ve written about Mr Murphy\u2019s estimate before and why it varies so much from HMRC\u2019s official figure.\n\nThe biggest component of the difference is how each calculates the value of the hidden economy or shadow economy.\n\nHMRC uses a \u201cbottom up\u201d approach, by surveying \u201cmoonlighters\u201d (people who have a declared income but also an undeclared income on the side) and \u201cghosts\u201d (people who do not declare any income to HMRC) to estimate the tax gap from the hidden economy. This comes to \u00a32.6 billion.\n\nMr Murphy instead applies a \u201ctop down\u201d approach, applying the tax yield as a proportion of GDP (which he works out to be around 33%) to the estimated total value of the hidden economy to work out the tax gap. His figure comes to between \u00a360 billion and \u00a367 billion.\n\nBoth figures have their limitations.\n\nMr Murphy\u2019s calculation is somewhat simplistic in assuming that the 33% figure which represents tax as a proportion of GDP can be applied to the hidden economy. For example there will be parts of the hidden economy (such as the trade in illegal drugs) which by their very nature cannot be taxed and so there is no tax gap.\n\nMeanwhile, HMRC acknowledges that the coverage of its data isn\u2019t comprehensive and so the \u201cestimate should be interpreted broadly as a lower limit for the true scale of the tax gap relating to this group of taxpayers.\u201d\n\nMore generally the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reviewed HMRC\u2019s analysis back in 2013.\n\nThe National Audit Office summarized the IMF\u2019s findings, saying it \u201cconcluded that HMRC produced one of the most comprehensive studies of the tax gap available internationally. It concluded that in general the methodologies HMRC used to estimate the tax gap were sound\u201d.\n\nHowever, the IMF \u201calso recommended that HMRC improve its estimates of undetected non-compliance\u201d, according to the NAO.\n\nUltimately, the NAO notes that \u201cThe tax gap is inherently difficult to estimate and HMRC acknowledges that no estimate of the tax gap can be definitive and that its estimates carry a degree of uncertainty\u201d.\n\nThe second part of Ms Sultana\u2019s tweet says that people seeking asylum have to live on just \u00a337.75 per week.\n\nThis is the level of cash support for each person in a household who is seeking asylum if they are homeless or do not have money to buy food. The government says this is to help pay for things like food, clothing and toiletries.\n\nPregnant mothers and young children are given slightly more to buy healthy food (between \u00a33 and \u00a35 a week), and women who are heavily pregnant or have a child under six weeks of age can apply for a one-off \u00a3300 payment.\n\nIn addition, housing is provided to people seeking asylum if they need it at no cost. Housing is expected to come with fittings, furniture, kitchen equipment and linen. Utilities are paid for. Housing providers do not need to provide a telephone line, internet connection or a television.", "lang": "en"}
