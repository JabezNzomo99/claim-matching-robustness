To meet this target, the UK also sets \u201ccarbon budgets\u201d on how much carbon it can emit in a five-year period.\n\nLord Deben, Chairman of the Committee on Climate Change this week said \u201cthe fact is that we\u2019re off track to meet our own emissions targets in the 2020s and 2030s\u201d, based on the carbon budgets for that period. The Committee on Climate Change is an independent body which advises the government on emissions targets, and was formed under the Climate Change Act 2008.\n\n\u201cThey restrict the amount of greenhouse gas the UK can legally emit in a five year period\u201d, with the goal of reducing the UK\u2019s carbon emissions to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. This week, a report by the Committee on Climate Change said \u201cOur conclusion is that the Government's current plans and proposals are not on track to meet carbon budgets.\u201d\n\nThey point out that in its Clean Growth Strategy, \u201cthe Government stated that a 5% yearly reduction (in emissions) was required to 2032 to meet the fifth carbon budget. The reduction in 2017 was therefore not on track\u201d\u2014it was around 4% in reality.\n\nThey also point to three key reasons why the government is not on track to meet its carbon budgets in the 2020s and 2030s:\n\u2022 They identify that two-thirds \u201cof potential emissions reductions from existing policies are at risk of underdelivery.\u201d\n\u2022 A range of \u201cambitious proposals\u201d the government made in its Clean Growth Strategy for dealing meeting emissions targets (such as phasing out sales of conventional cars and vans by 2040) are yet to be \u201cturned into firm policies\u201d.\n\u2022 \u201cThere are cost-effective opportunities to further reduce emissions\u201d where there is no government policy in place, and these aren\u2019t being realised. They include creating \u201ca route to market for the cheapest forms of low-carbon electricity generation (i.e. onshore wind and solar)\u201d.\n\nWhat has the government said?\n\nIn its Clean Growth Strategy from October 2017, the government recognised that it would probably not meet its targets for the two carbon budgets running between 2023 and 2032: \u201cOur current estimated projection for the fourth and fifth carbon budgets suggests that we could deliver 94 per cent and 93 per cent of our required performance against 1990 levels\u201d.\n\nThey point out that they are allowed some \u201cflexibility\u201d in meeting these budgets, under the terms of the Climate Change Act 2008. For instance, they can \u201cborrow\u201d carbon usage from a future budget (which is then itself \u201ctightened\u201d), with the Committee on Climate Change\u2019s approval.\n\nThey also argued at the time that \u201cambitious policies and proposals set out in this Strategy, and the rapid progress and accelerating pace of changes in low carbon technologies so far, suggest that we may not need to use this option.\u201d However, the Committee on Climate Change\u2019s most recent assessment suggests that evidence for this progress is yet to be brought to light.", "lang": "en"}
