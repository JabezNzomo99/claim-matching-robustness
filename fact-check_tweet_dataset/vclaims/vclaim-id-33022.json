The claim is false; the Indian news channel said the images were doctored and that it has not broadcast the story; an AFP photographer captured photos of livestock on sale in Jammu and Kashmir one day prior to Eid.\n\nThe images were published on Twitter here on August 11, 2019, one day before Eid al-Adha, a major religious holiday for Muslims.\n\nThe post was retweeted more than 2,600 thousand times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading tweet:\n\nThe tweet contains two images purporting to show part of a television broadcast. In the image on the left, the top banner states: \u201cAMID SEC 144, EID PREPARATIONS\u201d. The bottom banner states: \u201cNO ONE CAN SLAUGHTER ANIMAL NOW\u201d.\n\nIn the image on the right, the text states: \u201cBREAKING NEWS: BAN IMPOSED ON SACRIFICING ANIMAL IN KASHMIR\u201d.\n\nThe watermark for Indian news channel Mirror Now can be seen at the bottom right hand corner of both images.\n\nThe misleading post was published shortly after the Indian government revoked Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s special autonomy on August 5, 2019, as described in this AFP article.\n\nDuring Eid al-Adha, families are permitted to sacrifice a \u201critually acceptable animal (sheep, goat, camel, or cow)\u201d, according to this Encyclopedia Britannica definition.\n\nThe same doctored images were shared here and here on Twitter and here and here on Facebook with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the television channel report in the misleading post has been doctored.\n\nMirror Now Editor Faye D\u2019 Souza said the images showed a \u201cfake screen\u201d, according to this tweet posted on August 11.\n\n\u201c1.

I also got a sheep from the market and performed the Islamic ritual sacrifice on Monday (Eid day) at home.\"", "lang": "en"}
