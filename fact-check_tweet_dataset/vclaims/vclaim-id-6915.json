The Duterte administration, however, surpassed Estrada: Three work-related media killings occurred during Estrada\u2019s first 22 months.\n\nMedia watchdog CMFR provided VERA Files May 8 a list of the nine journalists killed under Duterte.\n\nOf the nine deaths mentioned in the report, seven appear on CMFR\u2019s online database, five of which are confirmed work-related and the remaining two confirmed nonwork-related.\n\nThe other two names that were not included in the database, Marlon Muyco and Apolinario Suan Jr., were culled from data consolidated by CMFR and NUJP. Reports point to the motives of their killings as still being inconclusive.\n\nAnalysis of CMFR data on media killings since 1987 show the first 22 months of the Corazon Aquino administration witnessed the highest number of work-related media killings at 11; and two nonwork-related killings.\n\nEven as media killings have dwindled, as Roque correctly said, the state of press freedom in the Philippines has worsened, contrary to his claim.\n\nWhile Roque did not provide the basis for his claim that the country\u2019s ranking in the most dangerous places for journalists has dropped, rankings from Paris-based media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) show a deteriorating media situation in the Philippines.\n\nIn 2018, the Philippines ranked 133rd in the World Press Freedom Index, six notches below its ranking in 2017. It is colored red on the global map, which indicates a \u201cbad\u201d press freedom situation.\n\n\n\nThe index ranks 180 countries based on the level of freedom available to journalists, providing a snapshot of the media freedom situation based on pluralism, independence of the media, quality of legislative framework and safety of journalists.\n\nThe index also keeps a detailed tally of abuses against the media through an abuses indicator, calculated based on the intensity of abuses and violence in a given period.\n\nIn 2018, the Philippines got an abuse score of 58.9, the 18th in rank among 180 countries evaluated.\n\nAn analysis of the press freedom index by the RSF in 2018 reads:\n\nMore, the Philippines placed fifth among 12 countries that figured in the 2017 Global Impunity Index of the Committee to Protect Journalists, which ranked countries \u201cwhere journalists are murdered and their killers go free.\u201d\n\nIn order of their rank in the impunity index, the other countries are Somalia, Syria, Iraq, South Sudan, Mexico, Pakistan, Brazil, Russia, Bangladesh, Nigeria and India.\n\nExtremist and criminal groups are the common killers in most countries, save for the Philippines, Russia and Brazil where government officials are those \u201cgetting away with murder,\u201d according to the index.\n\nUPDATE: NUJP, in a statement posted on Twitter, said it \"stands by its findings that nine (9) journalists have been killed under the Duterte administration.\"\n\nCMFR, in a statement posted on its website May 11, said the fact check \u201cfailed to get the story right on the level of both facts and context.\u201d The center said that during the preparation of the report, it had not yet included in its database all the cases during the Duterte administration. It thus relied on NUJP\u2019s figure instead of relying on its own. \n\n\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: VERA Files had obtained the data from CMFR's online database and additional details from its staff which it interviewed.\n\nVERA Files depended primarily on CMFR's online database because this enjoys a reputation of being highly reliable. The center is known for its longstanding practice of first carefully investigating the cases before concluding the motive. This is unlike NUJP's practice of concluding all killings as work-related until proved otherwise.\n\nMonths after CMFR issued its statement, its online database continues to list only five work-related media killings in Duterte's first 22 months. Rudy Alicaway, the journalist the May 11 statement says was killed because of work, continues to be on its list of nonwork-related killings. Two other journalists - Apolinario Suan and Marlon Muyco -- still do not appear in CMFR's database for both work- and nonwork-related killings.\n\nCenter for Media Freedom and Responsibility, Database on the Killings of Journalists in the Philippines since 1986\n\nCommittee to Protect Journalists, Getting Away with Murder, Oct. 31, 2017\n\n(Guided by the code of principles of the International Fact-Checking Network at Poynter, VERA Files tracks the false claims, flip-flops, misleading statements of public officials and figures, and debunks them with factual evidence.
