His witty word play and colorful characters have made many of his works, like \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham\u201d and \u201cThe Cat in the Hat,\u201d popular among young children.\n\nHowever, the Daily Caller News Foundation found no record of the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post in these works, or any of his others. It doesn\u2019t appear in the University of California, San Diego\u2019s collection of Geisel\u2019s editorial cartoons and early advertising artwork either.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no evidence he ever made this statement, Geisel has employed the same literary device in his own writing. For example, in his book \u201cHorton Hatches the Egg,\u201d Geisel wrote, \u201cI meant what I said, and I said what I meant.\u201d\n\nThe website Quote Investigator traced the earliest partial match back to a 1938 engineering journal, though elements of the quote appeared as early as 1855. In that journal, part of the longer expression attributed to Geisel in the Facebook post appears in quotation marks, indicating the quip might have already been circulating by that time.\n\n\u201cMr. Davies himself admitted that it was highly controversial and open to criticism; but criticism concerned both mind and matter,\u201d reads the passage, according to Quote Investigator. \u201c\u2018Those who mind don\u2019t matter, and those who matter don\u2019t mind.'\u201d\n\nQuote Investigator also found several instances in which the statement was employed in anecdotes about seating arrangements during the 1940s, with one crediting American financier and political adviser Bernard Baruch.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
