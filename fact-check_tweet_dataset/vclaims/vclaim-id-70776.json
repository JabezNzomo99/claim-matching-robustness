But he doesn\u2019t have the executive power to do the same for all workers, so the debate among the White House, Congress, economists and business leaders continues.\n\nCNN State of the Union host Candy Crowley asked Steve Forbes, chairman and editor-in-chief of Forbes Media, if raising the minimum wage would be good or bad for the bottom line, economically speaking.\n\n\"Remember, in terms of minimum wage, they are often with businesses with small margins, and two-thirds of the people who start out in minimum wage are above the minimum wage within a year, when they get skills,\" said Forbes, a former Republican presidential candidate.\n\nWe\u2019ll leave it to the economists to debate whether or not raising the minimum wage would help or hurt these workers. PunditFact wanted to know if two-thirds of minimum wage workers do start earning more within a year. Forbes didn\u2019t return our request for comment.\n\nWe found two papers that directly address his claim. In 2004, economists William Even and David Macpherson for the Employment Policies Institute, a fiscally conservative nonprofit think tank. Using federal labor statistics from the Current Population Survey, they did find that about two-thirds of workers see wage growth within a year.\n\nHowever, since that\u2019s pre-recession data, we\u2019ll place more emphasis on a . Two Texas A&M University economics professors, Jonathan Meer and Jeremy West, updated Even and Macpherson\u2019s findings using the same data source from 1979 to 2012.\n\nMeer and West reported the following trends of minimum wage workers:\n\u2022 \"While he was president, President Trump never encouraged Americans to get vaccinated.\"\n\nOf those that remained in the workforce, Meer and West found that 65.85 percent receive higher wages the next year.\n\nSo it\u2019s not that two-thirds of minimum wage workers earn more money the following year. It\u2019s two-thirds of those who continue to work, or 51 percent of all minimum wage workers.\n\nMinimum wage earners may choose to leave the labor force because they figure they can do about as well without a paycheck, but with government benefits, said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economics professor. There\u2019s a lot of flow in and out of the labor market that complicates Forbes\u2019 claim, she said.\n\nSinclair also pointed out that there\u2019s selection at play in this statistic. Individuals who keep their minimum-wage jobs for one year are proving that they\u2019re dedicated employees who can hold down jobs. That might speak more to why they\u2019re getting a raise than anything else, Sinclair said.\n\nForbes said two-thirds of people working for the minimum wage earn more money within a year. The real figure is 51 percent, because some people leave the labor force or lose their job.\n\nForbes\u2019 claim is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.", "lang": "en"}
