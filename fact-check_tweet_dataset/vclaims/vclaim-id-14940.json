Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.): \u201cWhen I was district attorney, I did an analysis of who the homicide victims were who were under the age of 25, the vast majority of whom were young black men. Because there was always \u2014 when there was an increase in murders \u2014 talk about putting more cops on the street, more gang enforcement, all that. And I said: \u2018Well, wait. Who are these victims? Who are they?\u2019 And the information came back to me: Ninety-four percent of them were high school dropouts. ...\n\n\u201cWhen I did it, I knew I was going to take a political hit. And the people around me said, \u2018Don\u2019t do it, because you are going to pay a price for this in terms of whatever future you want in politics.\u2019 And I said: \u2018Look, I\u2019m prepared to play the bad guy on this. I do not intend to put any parent in jail.\u2019 And no parent went to jail. But the school district, society, this community, everyone, including our business community, others, have got to take seriously the education of these children and give the parents the resources that they deserve and need. And that\u2019s what ended up happening. We improved attendance by over 30 percent and not a parent went to jail.\u201d\n\n\"On average, district attorneys reported prosecuting 3-6 [truancy] cases per year. This low number of prosecutions is due to the fact that early intervention strategies like assemblies, SART meetings and SARB hearings, and mediation programs are highly successful. \u201cThere may be extreme cases in which every effort to get a child back to school has been exhausted that are appropriate for prosecution. For example, using Penal Code 270.1, the Kings County District Attorney\u2019s office prosecuted a mother whose two elementary school children had a combined 116 absences in a single school year. The mother had disregarded and failed to respond to 15-20 previous outreach efforts. However, the district must engage in multiple intervention steps before a parent is prosecuted to provide extensive opportunities for families to correct attendance problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven today, others don\u2019t appreciate the intention behind my approach; they assume that my motivation was to lock up parents, when of course that was never the goal,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOur effort was designed to connect parents to resources that could help them get their kids back into school, where they belonged. We were trying to support parents, not punish them \u2014 and in the vast majority of cases, we succeeded. Still, I was willing to be the bad guy if it meant highlighting an issue that otherwise would have received too little attention. Political capital doesn\u2019t gain interest. You have to spend it to make a difference.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
