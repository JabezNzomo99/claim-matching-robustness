Its share in 2017/2018 was KSh5.2 billion. \n\n\n\n\n\nHow resources are shared can be a source of friction between Kenya\u2019s central government and its 47 new counties. Established by the 2010 constitution, the counties came into operation in 2013.\n\nTheir governments often want a larger share of the resources in their territories.

We examined his claim.\n\n\u2018We just want to benefit like Turkana\u2019\n\nChepkwony told Africa Check that the 30% figure was derived from\n\nsetting out how revenue earned from the country\u2019s natural resources should be shared.\n\nthat 20% of these funds go into a sovereign wealth fund. Out of the remaining 80%, the national government would get 60% (48% of the total) and counties 40%, or 32% of the total.\n\nIn May 2018, after a deal was struck on the\n\n20% of oil revenues, with the local community to get 5% and the central government 75%.\n\n\u201cWe just want to benefit the way Turkana has,\u201d Chepkwony told Africa Check.\n\nBut Turkana has not yet exported any oil and so hasn\u2019t received any money for it, Rosemary Nchinyei, the county\u2019s director of communication, told Africa Check.\n\nin June 2018 to truck oil from the county to the port of Mombasa for storage in preparation for\n\nKericho county has received close to KSh80 million from tea cess in recent years. \u201cCess\u201d is\n\u2022 based on the value of ) cess from March 2012 to May 2016.\n\u2022 None in 2016/17.

The levy was scrapped in 2016.\n\nThe KSh6.96 million received in 2016/17 was arrears collected in 2012 under a law that has since been repealed, he said.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the national government does not collect or levy any cess from tea,\u201d Muriithi said. \u201cBut the constitution allows county governments to impose taxes, including cess, in their jurisdiction so long as they enact the necessary legislations.\u201d\n\nagricultural cess on transporters of tea, but Africa Check has been unable to verify the amount collected so far.

Turkana is however yet to pocket any money for its oil.\n\nBut Kericho\u2019s government has received money from its tea industry. First, it has earned close to KSh80 million in levies on tea in recent years.\n\nSecond, the national government taxes Kericho\u2019s tea growers and processors. Part of this money finds its way back to Kericho in the \u201cequitable share\u201d of taxes that the national government distributes to counties.\n\nKericho received KSh5.2 billion in the equitable tax share in the 2017/2018 financial year.\n\nWe therefore rate the governor\u2019s claim as incorrect.", "lang": "en"}
