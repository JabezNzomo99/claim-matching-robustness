He addressed many topics, from impeachment to Syria to his decision to scrap the G-7 summit he\u2019d proposed to host at the Trump Doral property in Florida.\n\nWe looked at nine comments by Trump that needed a fact-check.\n\nWrongly says Obama did a poor job in fighting ISIS\n\n\"As far as ISIS is concerned, when I took over, in November 2016, ISIS was all over the place. I\u2019m the one, meaning it was me and this administration working with others, including the Kurds, that captured all of these people you\u2019re talking about. Under President Obama it was a mess.\"\n\nThe Trump administration notched important \u2014 even accelerating \u2014 progress in fighting the Islamic terrorist group, but Trump\u2019s claim is exaggerated.\n\nAt its peak in early 2015, ISIS held territory equivalent in size to Great Britain. According to estimates by IHS Markit, ISIS land control shrank from 90,800 square kilometers in January 2015 to 60,400 in January 2017. That\u2019s a one-third drop in Obama's final two years.\n\nThe group\u2019s reach continued to drop under Trump, to 36,200 square kilometers by July 2017 and to zero by mid 2019.\n\n\"ISIS had been on a trajectory in which it was already losing territory consistently before Trump took office,\" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, the CEO of Valens Global, a national security firm. \"The portrayal of ISIS being all over the place in the Obama years and then being destroyed in the Trump years is not accurate. It was consistently declining from January 2015.\"\n\nAnd observers including Gartenstein-Ross warn that Trump\u2019s recent moves in Syria \u2014 including his abandonment of the Kurds, who had battled ISIS in partnership with the United States \u2014 threaten to unravel the gains against ISIS.\n\nWrongly claims he was against the Iraq war\n\n\"I didn\u2019t want to go into Iraq. I was a civilian, so I had no power over it, but I was always speaking against going into Iraq.\"\n\nThis is a claim by Trump that we\u2019ve repeatedly rated False.\n\nWhile Trump did eventually come to that position when U.S. fortunes in the war turned south, he was more accepting of military action early on.\n\nIn 2002, asked if the United States should go to war, he said, \"I guess so.\" Less than three months before the invasion, Trump said the president should be more focused on the economy, but he didn\u2019t speak against launching an attack.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t speak often about the Iraq War before it happened, but what he said did not add up to the sort of opposition he describes today.\n\nSays the U.S. should have kept Iraq\u2019s oil, a likely illegal move\n\n\"I always thought if you\u2019re going in, keep the oil. Same thing here. Keep the oil.\"\n\nTrump has been consistent on this point, making the argument several times since he became a candidate for president. But when we floated Trump\u2019s idea of taking Iraq\u2019s oil by a half-dozen foreign policy experts, we encountered wide revulsion.\n\n\"I wish I could tell you all the ways it would be illegal and not kosher,\" said Steven R. Ratner, a University of Michigan law professor.\n\nTrump\u2019s idea is \"so out of step with any plausible interpretation of U.S. history or international law that they should be dismissed out of hand by anyone with even a rudimentary understanding of world affairs,\" said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University.\n\n\"Insofar as Mr. Trump's proposals are coherent enough to be subject to analysis and judgment, they appear to be practically impossible, legally prohibited, and politically imbecilic,\" said Barnett Rubin, associate director of New York University\u2019s Center on International Cooperation.\n\nSays he released a verbatim transcript of Ukraine call when he didn\u2019t\n\n\"I released a transcription done by stenographers of the exact conversation I had\" with the Ukrainian president.\n\nThe White House released a memorandum of the telephone call in July between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that has become a key focus of the House of Representatives\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nBut the document itself contradicts Trump\u2019s assertion that it is \"exact.\" The document includes a note of caution that it \"is not a verbatim transcript of a discussion.\"\n\n\"CAUTION: A Memorandum of a Telephone Conversation (TELCON) is not a verbatim transcript of a discussion. The text in this document records the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty Officers and NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place. A number of factors can affect the accuracy of the record, including poor telecommunications connections and variations in accent and/or interpretation. The word \u2018inaudible\u2019 is used to indicate portions of a conversation that the notetaker was unable to hear.\"\n\n\"He went before the United States Congress and he said a made up story. It was fabricated. He\u2019s totally fabricated story.\"\n\nThis is an exaggeration. The incident in question came during a congressional hearing chaired by U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. During the hearing, acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire testified about the Trump-Zelensky phone call and a whistleblower complaint describing it.\n\nDuring the hearing, Schiff explicitly said that he was trying to describe \"the essence\" of Trump\u2019s message \"shorn of its rambling character and in not so many words.\" He never tried to read the president\u2019s remarks in full, nor did he pretend to offer Trump\u2019s words.\n\nWe found Schiff\u2019s summary of the readout to be broadly accurate, though it did include some exaggerations.\n\nFor instance, Trump never explicitly asked Zelensky to \"make up dirt\" on Biden, as Schiff said. And he did not repeat the demand seven times \u2014 a detail Schiff admitted was exaggerated.\n\nAnd Trump did not say Zelensky could not call back until he\u2019d satisfied Trump\u2019s demands, as Schiff said. In reality, the call ended with Trump congratulating Zelensky on his election.\n\nSays the emoluments clause is phony when it\u2019s in the Constitution\n\nTrump may not like the emoluments clause, which bars officials from receiving payments from foreign entities. The concept is the basis for lawsuits challenging foreign payments to Trump\u2019s Washington hotel. But it\u2019s not phony \u2014 it\u2019s in the Constitution. It says:\n\n\"No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\"\n\nThe clause has rarely been tested in court. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel has examined it about 50 times over 150 years in order to advise government officials about what\u2019s prohibited, Kathleen Clark, professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis, told us earlier this year.\n\n\"The household median income for eight years of President Bush, it rose $400. For eight years of President Obama, it rose $975. And for two and a half years President Trump \u2026 it rose $5,000.\"\n\nThis uses one measurement, but not the official one.\n\nThis set of statistics originated in a pair of columns by Steve Moore of the conservative Heritage Foundation. Moore\u2019s columns cited data from Sentier Research, a private firm that analyzes government economic data. Sentier\u2019s report uses a different source of federal data than the standard household income measurements. Sentier\u2019s methodology has technical pluses and minuses that we won\u2019t referee here. The important thing for judging Trump\u2019s remark is that Sentier\u2019s data offers an alternative to the official government figure \u2014 and the official numbers, in this case, are less favorable than Trump lets on.\n\nHere\u2019s the pattern for median household income since 1975, with Republican presidents shown in red and Democratic presidents shown in blue.\n\nSo median income has risen under Trump, and economists expect it to rise again in 2019 once those figures are available. But even taking the expected 2019 statistics into account, the increase under Trump in the official data is should be smaller than the increase Sentier\u2019s data shows, while the increase under Obama \u2014 even factoring in the Great Recession he inherited \u2014 is bigger than Sentier\u2019s data shows.\n\nSentier\u2019s measure \"probably gives some useful signal for the evolution of household income within a calendar year, but it\u2019s no replacement for the official annual numbers published by Census,\" said Ernie Tedeschi, managing director of the firm Evercore ISI.\n\nAnd contrary to Trump\u2019s suggestion, the official data \"shows that the current economic expansion represents the continuation of one that clearly was underway in President Obama\u2019s second term,\" said Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist.\n\nSays without evidence that Obama tried repeatedly to start a dialogue with Kim Jong Un\n\nTrump said he asked North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un, \"'Did you ever call Obama?\u2019 No. Actually, he tried. Eleven times. But the man on the other side, the gentleman on the other side, did not take his call. Okay? Lack of respect. But he takes my call.\"\n\nThe public record shows the Obama administration rejected the idea of meetings of any sort until North Korea promised to back off of its nuclear program and accept international inspections.\n\nWhile the administration held out hope of North Korea meeting those preconditions during Obama\u2019s first term, in the second, it took a harder line. There is no evidence that Obama begged for a meeting.\n\nExaggerates the size of the Miami airport\n\n\"Miami International, one of the biggest airports in the world. Some people say it is the biggest, but one of the biggest airports in the world.\"\n\nTrump wrongly described Miami International Airport as he elaborated on his decision to cancel plans to host the G-7 summit at Trump National Doral, which is near the airport.\n\nThere are multiple ways to measure how busy or how big airports are, but the key metric is passenger traffic.\n\nIn 2018, Miami ranked 42nd in passenger traffic among worldwide airports, according to data on the airport\u2019s website. If we only looked at airports in the United States, Miami ranks 13th.\n\nThe Miami airport website\u2019s rankings chart shows it first in one category: international freight among airports in the United States. It also states that it \"offers more flights to Latin America and the Caribbean than any other U.S. airport.\"\n\nHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was the world\u2019s top airport for passenger traffic volume in 2018, according to the Airports Council International rankings released in September 2019.", "lang": "en"}
