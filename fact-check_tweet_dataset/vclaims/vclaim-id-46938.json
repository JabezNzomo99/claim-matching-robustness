No, that's not true: a YouTube video pulled clips selectively from another video of Obama giving a speech in Turkey in 2009 and presented them out of context to suggest the former president wasn't an American citizen.\n\nThe original speech was given at the Tophane Cultural Center in Istanbul on April 7, 2009. The Obama White House YouTube page posted a full video of the original speech from which the edited version pulls footage.\n\nThe story originated from a video (archived here) where it was published by the user Deepsouth Starseed on February 9, 2016, under the title \"Barack Obama Admits He Was Born in Kenya Speech.\" Text surrounding the video said:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe original speech was given to address issues between the U.S. and the Muslim world in hopes of setting the tone for future relations.\n\nBut the edited version of the original only presents bits and pieces from the actual speech. The larger claims about Obama's citizenship have long since been debunked by news outlets and even President Donald Trump himself. But our team looked into some of the smaller claims the doctored video makes.\n\nAt one point, the fabricated video makes it seem like Obama says \"Well, first of all, it's true, I'm not an American\":\n\nBut in actuality, Obama said:\n\nThen, the video claims Obama said he was not born in Hawaii nor in the U.S.:\n\nBut, again, in reality Obama said:\n\nFurthermore, the video presents Obama saying that he comes from Kenya:\n\nObama did mention Kenya in the original speech, but only to say that his father was from there:\n\nThe faux video also claims Obama said the the U.S. is a place where anyone has a chance to make it \"through misleading and dishonest practices\":\n\nThat appears nowhere in the real transcript of the talk that Obama gave.\n\nThe video immediately follows that with Obama's falsified quote that said \"if that wasn't true, then somebody named Barack Hussein Obama, from Kenya, from Africa, would not be elected president of the United States\":\n\nBut that, too, proves to be a mashup of two of Obama's separate quotes in the real speech:\n\n\"That's how my father, who was from Kenya, from Africa ...\" \"And we are still a place where anybody has a chance to make it if they try. If that wasn't true, then somebody named Barack Hussein Obama would not be elected President of the United States of America. That's the America I want you to know.\"\n\nThough Obama's citizenship was shut down early on as a hoax, the highly manipulated footage of this video is still dangerous as the nation is operating in an election year for president. Trust of the Office of the President, as well as of Trump who looked to discredit Obama's presidency, is often threatened by deceitful editing.\n\nDeepfakes like these can mislead voters into believing falsified information that is presented as truth.\n\nWe wrote about youtube.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Virginia Governor Does NOT Plan To Use Roadblocks And U.N.
