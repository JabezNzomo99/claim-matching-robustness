There\u2019s no evidence the video \u2014 showcasing audio from Trump\u2019s 2020 State of the Union address \u2014 was \u201cbanned,\u201d or that it\u2019s an ad from the Trump campaign.\n\nFacebook recently removed a video posted by President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign in which Trump claimed that children are \u201cvirtually immune\u201d to COVID-19. The platform said it violated a policy on COVID-19 misinformation that can lead to physical harm. (As we\u2019ve explained, while children rarely become seriously ill from COVID-19, they can get sick.)\n\nA viral post now being shared by thousands, however, is erroneously claiming to show a Trump \u201ccampaign ad\u201d that Facebook has \u201cbanned.\u201d There is no evidence it was \u201cbanned\u201d or removed, or that it is an ad from the campaign.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump campaign ad being banned by Facebook,\u201d the video meme reads.\n\nThe post, uploaded in late June, has more than 187,000 shares \u2014 and remains live, undercutting the assertion that the underlying video has been \u201cbanned\u201d by the platform. It\u2019s been viewed more than 4 million times.\n\nThe supposed \u201cad\u201d runs about 3:45 seconds and features audio from the end of Trump\u2019s 2020 State of the Union address.\n\nThe video depicts Trump offering an optimistic view of the country by discussing its history: It pairs photos and video clips with Trump\u2019s speech as he talks about America\u2019s \u201cheroes\u201d and \u201clegends\u201d such as Thomas Edison, President Abraham Lincoln and Harriet Tubman, among many others.\n\n\u201cAmerica is the place where anything can happen. America is the place where anyone can rise,\u201d Trump says. \u201cAnd here, on this land, on this soil, on this continent, the most incredible dreams come true.\u201d\n\nThe start of the video shows a small text reading \u201c@StormIsUponUs.\u201d We found an Instagram account using that handle that posted the video following the State of the Union in February. The video is still live and available; Instagram is owned by Facebook.\n\nThere are also other uploads of the video with the title \u201cThe Best Is Yet To Come!\u201d on YouTube and Facebook \u2014 the latter of which refers to it as \u201cTrump\u2019s new ad.\u201d\n\nWe did not find instances of the video being advertised by the Trump campaign in the Facebook Ad Library (which includes ads that have been taken down).\n\nTrump and his campaign have put out other videos using the phrase the \u201cbest is yet to come\u201d that are still on Facebook. The phrase also was part of a Trump Super Bowl ad and an ad showcasing his July 4 speech (which uses some similar imagery \u2014 and the same footage when referring to the Wright brothers \u2014 as the viral Facebook video).\n\nFacebook has, as we said, at times removed content posted by the Trump campaign that it said violated different policies.\n\nIn another example, the platform took down campaign ads earlier this year that instructed users to \u201cRESPOND NOW\u201d to an \u201cOfficial Congressional District Census.\u201d The ads were not for the U.S. Census \u2014 and instead went to a campaign website \u2014 and Facebook said the ads would be taken down to \u201cprevent confusion around the U.S. Census.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not true that the video in question, highlighting a portion of Trump\u2019s 2020 State of the Union address, was a \u201ccampaign ad\u201d that was \u201cbanned\u201d by the platform.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
