Ralph Northam said, \u201cYou will give up your guns, if you don\u2019t I\u2019ll have the National Guard cut your power, your phone lines, and your internet. Then, if you still refuse to comply I\u2019ll have you killed.\u201d\n\nThere is no record of Northam ever saying the statement. It references a viral internet hoax that was previously debunked.\n\nAn image falsely alleged in a post that Northam threatened Virginia residents with violence if they don\u2019t hand their guns over to the government. It references a viral internet hoax that the governor plans to use the Virginia National Guard and other drastic measures to confiscate certain types of firearms.\n\n\u201cYou will give up your guns, if you don\u2019t I\u2019ll have the National Guard cut your power, your phone lines, and your internet,\u201d the post credits Northam with saying. \u201cThen, if you still refuse to comply I\u2019ll have you killed.\u201d (RELATED: Is Governor Ralph Northam Planning To Cut Off Electricity And Communication Capabilities Ahead Of Gun Confiscation?)\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation rated the claim that Northam plans to cut off electricity and communication capabilities ahead of confiscating guns as false Dec. 30. Both the Governor\u2019s office and the Virginia National Guard made statements debunking it.\n\nThere is no evidence that Northam ever said the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. A search of his verified Twitter accounts didn\u2019t turn up any matches. No credible sources linked the statement to him online either.\n\nAlena Yarmosky, the press secretary for Northam\u2019s office, confirmed to fact-checking website Snopes that Northam never made the statement and has not planned gun confiscation raids.\n\n\u201cPeople who spread lies like this should be ashamed of themselves,\u201d Yarmosky also told Snopes.

In response, more than 100 counties, cities and towns in Virginia have declared themselves \u201cSecond Amendment sanctuaries\u201d in largely symbolic resolutions, according to The Associated Press.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no record of Northam threatening violence against Virginia gun owners, he has said localities could face repercussions if law enforcement officers don\u2019t enforce the gun control bills if they become laws.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be retaliation. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m about. I\u2019m about making Virginia safer,\u201d Northam said Dec. 11, according to WTKR News 3. \u201cIf we have constitutional laws on the books and law enforcement officers are not enforcing those laws on the books, then there are going to be consequences, but I\u2019ll cross that bridge if and when we get to it.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
