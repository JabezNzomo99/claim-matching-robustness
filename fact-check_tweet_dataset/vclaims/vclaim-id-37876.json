It includes statistics from some Australian states covering the entire year, rather than just the current fire season. The figure also counts all bushfire-related law enforcement actions in other states.\n\nBushfires have swept across Australia since September 2019, killing at least 30 people and burning more than 24.7 million acres, according to BBC News. Australia recorded its hottest and driest year yet in 2019, providing the perfect conditions for intense and prolonged bushfires, which many scientists say have been exacerbated by climate change.\n\nThe Sun and several other media outlets ran headlines alleging that police have arrested nearly 200 people for deliberately starting the wildfires. Some, like The Sun and InfoWars, cited vague police data from various Australian states.

The figure also counts all bushfire-related law enforcement actions in other states.\n\nA spokesperson for the Queensland Police Force told The Guardian that the 101 figure cited for the state represents \u201cpolice enforcement actions\u201d for a broad range of bushfire-related offenses, including \u201ccharging, restorative justice or cautioning.\u201d That means the figure does not represent the total number of individuals arrested for deliberately starting wildfires, as The Sun and other outlets suggested. Legal actions can range from cautions to fines to criminal charges for offenses less severe than arson.\n\nSince Nov. 8, 2019, New South Wales (NSW) police have taken action against 183 people for 205 bushfire-related offenses, according to a Jan. 6 NSW Police Force statement. Of those 183 individuals, 24 were charged with deliberately setting bushfires, while others face legal action for, among other offenses, not complying with the total fire ban or improperly discarding lit cigarettes or matches, per an email from the NSW Police Force media unit.\n\nThe reported 43 figure for Victoria counts all recorded offenses of intentionally or recklessly causing bushfires for the year ending September 2019, according to data provided to the DCNF by the state\u2019s Crime Statistics Agency. That means those offenses occurred before the current bushfire season.

Since July 1, 2019, there have been at least two charges for unlawfully setting fire to vegetation.\n\nSouth Australia has seen 10 arrests or reports for causing bushfires intentionally or recklessly between Sept. 1, 2019 and Jan. 8, 2020, Senior Constable Rebecca Stokes told the DCNF in an email.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
