So why did he laud three bills?", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2016-02-02T18:55:17Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-82799", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/07/15/obamas-claim-that-the-gop-has-blocked-every-serious-idea/", "vclaim": "The president started on this path on June 27, during a speech in Minnesota: \u201cYou know, sometimes I\u2019m forcibly, you know, politic about how I say things, but I\u2019m finding lately that I just want to say what\u2019s on my mind. So, let me just be clear I want you to think about this, so far this year the Republicans in Congress have blocked or voted down every single serious idea to strengthen the middle class.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the odd thing: on the very day the president recorded his weekly address, the office of House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) released this photo under the happy headline of \u201cWhat Working Together Looks Like.\u201d It showed Boehner, Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) and other lawmakers signing the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, which streamlines job training programs, so it could be sent to Obama for his signature.\n\n\u201cThis morning, leaders of both parties in the House came together to get something done for the millions of Americans who continue to struggle to find work in today\u2019s economy,\u201d the news release said.\n\nObama had earlier said he looked forward to signing the bill. \u201cThis bipartisan compromise will help workers, including workers with disabilities, access employment, education, job-driven training, and support services that give them the chance to advance their careers and secure the good jobs of the future,\u201d he said in a statement on July 9. \u201cToday\u2019s vote helps ensure that our workers can earn the skills employers are looking for right now and that American businesses have the talent pool it takes to compete and win in our global economy.\u201d\n\nObviously, one person\u2019s \u201cserious idea\u201d may not match other person\u2019s\u2014especially in the opposite party. In the weekly address, Obama specifically mentioned \u201clifting the minimum wage, fair pay, student loan reform.\u201d But that does mean that the few bills that have passed Congress this year are not serious?\n\nThe Water Resources Reform and Development Act, which advocates claimed could sustain as many as 500,000 new jobs. \u201cThe first bill I\u2019ll sign today is the Water Resources Reform and Development Act, also known as WRRDA, which will put Americans to work modernizing our water infrastructure and restoring some of our most vital ecosystems, the president said when he signed it. \u201cDuring my State of the Union address, I asked Congress to pass this bill by the summer, and I congratulate this outstanding crew for getting it done.\u201d\n\nThe Farm Bill, which the White House called \u201ca jobs bill, an innovation bill, a research bill, and a conservation bill.\u201d The White House claimed it would generate $35 in economic benefits for every dollar invested and put together a graphic to share on Twitter and Facebook that showed \u201cFive ways the Farm Bill strengthens the economy.\u201d\n\nBut, let\u2019s face it, the Republicans have their own list of bills passed in the House but which have failed to progress in the Senate, which they also claim are serious and enjoy popular support. For instance, one pending bill would approve construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which a recent Washington Post-ABC News poll found is supported by Americans by a 3 to 1 margin. The House list, displayed on Boehner\u2019s Web site, includes nearly 50 bills, of which only a handful have been signed by the president into law.\n\nWe make no judgement on which side has the surplus of \u201cserious ideas,\u201d but the president is engaging in rhetorical overkill. Certainly this congressional session has resulted in few major laws. Perhaps he could make a case that Republicans have blocked many bills that he has sought\u2014or even that his most prized initiatives have been stymied.\n\nBut to claim that \u201cevery serious idea\u201d has been blocked is going too far\u2013given that the president lauded at least three bills as aiding the middle class. (Update: In a speech the morning this column appeared, the president adjusted his language appropriately: \u201cRepublicans in Congress keep blocking or voting down some of the ideas that would have the biggest impact on middle-class and working families.\u201d)", "lang": "en"}
