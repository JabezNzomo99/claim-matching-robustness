Froti, a clinical psychologist with no professional background in biology or physics who claims to have been taught \u201chow key mathematical information affects the consciousness of the cells\u201d from \u201cmulti-dimensional beings of light whose goal is to bring healing to our world\u201d after a near-death experience.\n\nIn that post, she reviews a litany of complaints about the older backscatter x-ray scanners once employed by the Transportation Security Administration before diving into perceived health risks of the newer, millimeter wave technology:\n\nNow they also want us to believe that the replacement technology, millimeter wave \u201cdigital strip search\u201d scanners, are also \u201cperfectly safe\u201d. Don\u2019t believe it for a second. [\u2026] These millimeter wave technologies are designed to bombard innocent travelers with high frequency energy particles known as terahertz photons. A study conducted by Boian S. Alexandrov et.al. at the Center for Nonlinear Studies at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, revealed that these terahertz waves could \u201c\u2026unzip double-stranded DNA, creating bubbles that could significantly interfere with processes such as gene expression and DNA replication.\u201d\n\nThe new technology Froti describes, referred to by the TSA as \u201cmillimeter wave Advanced Imaging Technology\u201d, has been in common use at American airports since 2012. It works by bouncing electromagnetic waves of a specific frequency range called terahertz radiation, which is described in a 2007 report on its potential for security applications:\n\nTo support her argument that these devices are dangerous, she links to a 2009 MIT Technology Review article discussing a study (the \u201cLos Alamos study\u201d) that sought to address interactions between the natural frequencies present in the hydrogen bonds of DNA and a THz field:\n\nAt first glance, it\u2019s easy to dismiss any notion that they can be damaging. Terahertz photons are not energetic enough to break chemical bonds or ionise atoms or molecules, the chief reasons why higher energy photons such as x-rays and UV rays are so bad for us. But could there be another mechanism at work? [\u2026] [Lead author of the study Boian] Alexandrov and co have created a model to investigate how THz fields interact with double-stranded DNA and what they\u2019ve found is remarkable. They say that although the forces generated are tiny, resonant effects allow THz waves to unzip double-stranded DNA, creating bubbles in the double strand that could significantly interfere with processes such as gene expression and DNA replication.\n\nBecause (and despite Froti\u2019s claim of \u201chigh energy\u201d) these electric fields are not strong enough to actually cleave chemical bonds, they reasoned that another mechanism must be present if terahertz fields are to impart any biologic effect. In their study, Alexandrov and colleagues wanted to investigate the possibility that terahertz radiation, because it is similar in frequencies of energy holding hydrogen bonds together, could possibly interact in a way so as to amplify each other\u2019s signals to the point where it could break chemical bonds:\n\nUltimately, the authors found that while unlikely, it is possible that, under a set of remarkably specific conditions, such a phenomenon is possible:\n\nOne reason Froti may have avoided the study itself is that it makes no mention of airport scanners, although the MIT Technology Review article did use them as a news hook for its story. According to the actual authors of the paper, however, their research holds no relevance to airport scanners. In an e-mail, Alexandrov (the lead author of the \u201cLos Alamos\u201d study), told us:\n\nCo-author Anny Usheva reiterated this point via email as well:\n\nIndeed, she clarified that her research (on which she said they have made progress but are held up due to a lack of funding) aims to use THz radiation over much longer intervals of time to \u201creprogram\u201d cells for regenerative medicine:\n\nNeedless to say, an airport scanner does not expose travellers to eight hours of continuous radiation. The federally funded research and development center Pacific Northwest Laboratories highlights the actual time frame on a page describing the development of the TSA\u2019s scanners:\n\nThat same website, conveniently, lists all of the patents associated with the TSA\u2019s millimeter wave technology. While there are several frequency ranges associated with the methodologies patented to analyze millimeter data, the three patents that describe the actual device employed by TSA makes it clear that only a small fraction of the terahertz range is utilized, as described in the most recent patent filing:\n\nExpressed in GHz, the broadband exposure (i.e. multiple wavelengths at the same time) Usheva investigated was 100 to 10,000 GHz, a range that barely overlaps with with the TSA\u2019s stated range of 1 to 110 GHz, and a far cry from \u201cbroad band\u201d terahertz radiation.\n\nThe authors of the study themselves refute the claims made by the \u201cCollective Evolution\u201d post and the study itself is, for all intents and purposes, irrelevant to the technology utilized by airport scanners. As such, we rate this claim as false.", "lang": "en"}
