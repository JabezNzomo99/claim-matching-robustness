The caption with the photo, written in Hindi, translates to, 'Yet again today, a mother's heart has wailed. Yet again today, a lover has lost her beloved.'\n\nThe Facebook post below is graphic in nature.\n\nThe disturbing image has been shared from several pages on Facebook with the same caption. The archived post can be accessed here.\n\nYou can also read other fake news related to the Pulwama attack debunked by BOOM here\n\u2022 No, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra Did Not Laugh At Presser After Pulwama Attack\n\u2022 No, Rahul Gandhi Is Not Posing With The Pulwama Attack Suicide Bomber\n\nWhen BOOM reverse image searched the picture, we came across several tweets that shared the same picture.\n\nThe cardboard boxes seen near the charred body in the viral image made it easier to find out the source. In October 2017, the Indian Air Force had faced severe flak for flying to the airbase the bodies of seven Air Force and Military personnel who had lost their lives in a chopper crash.\n\nThe cardboard box controversy was covered widely in media back then and some of the images shared in the tweets, along with the viral image, were from the chopper crash from October 7, 2017.\n\nBOOM had earlier reported when the images had gone viral in a different context. The report can be accessed here.\n\nWhile we couldn't find the same image shared on the viral Facebook post, we could find the other pictures carried along with the viral picture in the tweets.\n\nMeanwhile, we did find the same image on an online news portal Wyrta, based in Meghalaya. The report is written in Pnar, a dialect spoken by Pnar people of the Jaintia tribe in Meghalaya. The report can be accessed here.", "lang": "en"}
