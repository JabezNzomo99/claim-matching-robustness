It is being claimed that the idols were found while digging in Ayodhya.\n\nThe caption of the post read, \u2018Buddha statues while digging in Ayodhya. Ramayan is not history but a fictional story \u2764\ufe0f\u2019. (Translated from Tamil)\n\nClick here for the achieved post.\n\nWe fact-checked the above post and found that these pictures are OLD and not from Ayodhya.\n\nWe put the pictures through Reverse Image Search individually and found the following.\n\nWe found the first picture on Kickstarter\u2019s website in an article dated April 25, 2013. According to the article, the picture was taken at Mes Aynak in Afghanistan. The image has been credited to Brent E Huffman, who is a director, producer, cinematographer and editor of a documentary called \u2018Saving Mes Aynak.\u2019\n\nWe found the second picture in an article published by a website called Ancient Pages in July 2016 which carried the viral image and mentioned that the image is from Jaulian in Taxila in Pakistan.\n\nThe caption of the picture read, \u2018Ruins in a Buddhist Monastery, Jaulian, Taxila\u2019.\n\nWe found the third picture in an article by The Indian Express, dated January 23, 2019. The headline of the article was: \u2018After Nalanda and Vikramshila, Bihar unearths Telhara university.\u2019\n\nThe caption of the picture read: \u2018Other history books too talk of Tiladhak monastery, on the western side of Nalanda, as having four big halls and three staircases. It is said the mahavihara or university was built by one of the descendents of Magadha ruler Bimbisara. The monastery was decorated with copper and also had small copper bells that gently chimed in the breeze.
