{"title": "Does the Cancer Act of 1939 Make It Illegal to Cure Cancer?", "subtitle": "The act, which has had all but one of its provisions replaced or repealed, prevents anyone from advertising a cure for cancer to the general public in the UK.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2018-07-18T17:26:31+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-5268", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/cancer-act-1939/", "vclaim": "Myriad unfounded claims have been made of the UK\u2019s Cancer Act of 1939, a law which some critics of the modern medical industry have suggested is part of a conspiracy to prevent a cure for cancer from being discovered so that \u201cbig pharma\u201d can continue to profit from the disease unabated.\n\nIn fact, the law prohibits any person from taking \u201cany part in the publication of any advertisement \u2026 containing an offer to treat any person for cancer, or to prescribe any remedy therefor, or to give any advice in connection with the treatment thereof.\u201d The act had other provisions when first passed, but the advertising portion is the only aspect of the act that remains on the books:\n\nBecause it arrived nearly a decade before the founding of the NHS [National Health Service], the [Cancer] Act also contained details about how local councils should provide treatment and other services for cancer patients. And there was a whole section explaining how money should be allocated around the country to buy supplies of a radioactive element called radium \u2014 a forerunner of the far more sophisticated radiotherapy treatments we have today. All but one of these sections have now been repealed or subsumed into other pieces of legislation, and only one \u2014 section four \u2014 still stands. [Put simply, that section] is a blanket ban on advertising cancer treatments to the general public.\n\nOne meme on the subject appearing online attempts to state as fact that the actually prevents anyone from curing cancer by criminalizing that activity:\n\nFirst, since this law was passed by the British Parliament, no \u201cmedical practitioners\u201d are being prosecuted \u201cin America\u201d under the law.\n\nMore important, the act in no way prevents people from developing or researching cures for cancer. In fact, UK-based entities frequently fund research into cancer cures. The Act merely bars anyone (including UK drug manufacturers) from advertising they have a product that will \u201ccure\u201d cancer.\n\nThe Act also does not, as claimed by Cannabis-culture website Herb, make it \u201cillegal to promote, write about, or even speak about cancer therapies other than radiation.\u201d That claim apparently stems from the way the act defines an advertisement: \u201cIn this section the expression \u2018advertisement\u2019 includes any notice, circular, label, wrapper or other document, and any announcement made orally or by any means of producing or transmitting sounds.\u201d\n\nWhile the definition of what constitutes an advertisement is broad, the Act applies to the \u201cpublication\u201d of an advertisement. The law was intended to protect patients from quacks and snake oil peddlers, a threat as real to cancer patients then as it is today. The few prosecutions that have taken place under the Act are in keeping with that spirit of the law.\n\nFor example, a man named Jerry Sargeant, who calls himself \u201cThe Facilitator\u201d and purports to have the ability to edit \u201cpeople\u2019s karmic blueprints through distance healing\u201d (for the low price of \u00a390 per quarter hour), claimed in several YouTube videos that his skills allowed him to rid people of cancer. He was found guilty of four violations under the Act and fined \u00a34,700.\n\nIn another example, a \u201clife coach and naturopathic doctor\u201d who calls himself Dr. Stephen Ferguson (who is not a medical doctor, but has a PhD in nutrition and hypnosis), claimed that multiple patients of his had been \u201ccured\u201d of cancer thanks to vitamin supplements and protein shakes sold on his website. He was fined \u00a31,750 for violating the Act.\n\nIf, in a bizarre turn of events, an individual did actually discover smoothie-based or telepathic cures for cancer, they would be free under the Cancer Act of 1939 to publish about their discoveries in scientific journals, discuss them privately or in academic contexts, or to continue researching the concept. They would not, however, be allowed to present that information to the general public in advertisements in the United Kingdom.", "lang": "en"}
