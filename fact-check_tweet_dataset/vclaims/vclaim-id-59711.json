In her post, she calls out Shukla for misusing her photos to falsely claim that an organ racket was taking place in Maharashtra and clarified that she and her colleague Deepak Mahajan, through their NGO Ek Koshish Aisi Bhi, cremated unclaimed bodies.\n\nWe also found a post by her dated 18 July in which she had uploaded the viral photos, with a message saying that they had cremated (after post-mortem) the unclaimed body of a 43-year-old woman who had been brought to Lucknow\u2019s Civil Hospital but died during treatment.\n\nShe added that they had, so far, cremated 17 such unclaimed bodies during the lockdown. A glance through her profile showed us that she had also filed an FIR with the Cyber Cell asking for action to be taken against Shukla.\n\nThe Quint also got in touch with Verma, the chairperson of the NGO, who confirmed that the viral photos were indeed from a cremation done by her on 18 July in Lucknow.\n\nShe also told us that she had taken the advice of her advocate and filed an FIR with the Cyber Cell and the police station in her locality against Shukla and was also planning to file a defamation case against him.", "lang": "en"}
