Polls Disagree", "subtitle": "Despite the RT head\u2019s claim that opposition to Russia and its leader is strictly the purview of Western powers-that-be, international polling shows that Putin is by no means supported by a global majority.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "September 24, 2018", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-52196", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/rt-putin-global-popularity-simonyan/29507477.html", "vclaim": "The Second Eurasian Women\u2019s Forum held in St. Petersburg last week reportedly brought together 2,000 politicians, entrepreneurs, scientists and public figures from 110 countries to discuss a raft of political and economic issues.\n\nAccording to organizers, \u201cthe highlight of the event\u201d was the plenary session titled \u201cWomen for Global Security and Sustainable Development,\u201d featuring an address by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nBut for Russian state media, an event dedicated to the empowerment of women was seized on as an opportunity to lavish praise on the Russian president.\n\nOne video, published by Russian Insider under the title \u201cWomen Went Crazy Around Putin! Russian President Was A Superstar At Eurasian Women\u2019s Forum,\u201d insinuated that the Russian president was the reason the women had gotten \u201cdolled up\u201d for the event.\n\nWhile footage from that report shows attendees giving Putin a cordial welcome, Margarita Simonyan, editor in chief of RT, told Russia-1's \u201cEvening With Vladimir Solovyov\u201d that the Russian president received a reception more befitting of a \u201crock star,\u201d claiming that a \u201cserious international audience\u201d of women were \u201crushing in a last ditch effort to meet him like schoolchildren at a Beatles\u2019 concert.\u201d\n\nBut when Solovyov pitched a seemingly pre-prepared question -- \u201cWhy do women from different countries, not all (of whom) treat Russia unequivocally well, why do they react like this to Putin?\u201d \u2013 Simonyan responded with a false claim.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always arguing with my acquaintances and friends working in the so-called or not so-called opposition media \u2026 who love to repeat the phrase: \u2018the whole world is against us\u2019\u2026,\u201d Simonyan said. \u201cI always want to point out to my friends: \u2018And what, China isn\u2019t the world, India isn\u2019t the world, the Arab world, almost all of which is completely on our side, well a significant part of it, isn\u2019t the world? Latin America isn\u2019t the world? People don\u2019t notice their own snobbism and their well, what borders on xenophobia. They don\u2019t respect other nations, because for those people, the world is the Western world, and not just people from the so-called Western world, but the Western establishment\u2026\u201d\n\nSimonyan went on to state that the largest part of the world in terms of population shares Russia\u2019s annoyance with the \u201chypocrisy emanating from the West,\u201d adding that even Nino Burjanadze, former chairperson of Georgia\u2019s parliament, reacted very positively despite the fact that Georgia is the only country with which Russia \u201chas officially gone to war.\u201d She added that American representatives were also in attendance.\n\nBut what about the claim that disdain for Russian policy in general and Putin in particular is strictly a manifestation of the Western establishment?\n\nAccording to 2017 poll results released by Pew Research Center, \u201cRussia\u2019s international image is more negative than positive,\u201d with 34% of respondents viewing Russia \u201cin a positive light overall,\u201d and 40% viewing it \u201cnegatively.\u201d\n\nDecidedly mixed opinions were found in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.\n\nOf the countries surveyed in the Middle East, where the United Nations has implicated Russia in war crimes in Syria, 93% of Jordanians, 62% of Turks and 61% of Israelis expressed a negative view of Russia, according to Pew. The Lebanese were relatively split, with 48% expressing negative sentiment vs. 47% positive, while Tunisians were also narrowly divided at 37% negative vs. 39% positive.\n\nBut Simonyan was correct that Indians do generally hold a favorable view of Russia, with 47% expressing a favorable view and only 13% indicating an unfavorable one.\n\nData for China was unavailable, but a plurality of South Koreans (41%) and a majority of Japanese (61%) hold an unfavorable opinion of Russia. By contrast, 83% of Vietnamese and 53% of Filipinos have a positive view of Russia.\n\nIn Latin America, a slim plurality of Brazilians (36%) expressed a negative view of Russia (vs. 35% positive). Argentinians were split at 27% each, while a slim plurality of Columbians (32%) expressed a positive attitude toward Russia (vs. 31% negative). Other countries where pluralities expressed positive sentiment were Mexico (32%), Peru (41%) and Venezuela (38%).\n\nA plurality of South Africans and Kenyans expressed a negative view of Russia (40% and 29%, respectively), while a plurality of respondents in Ghana (33%), Nigeria (45%), Senegal (34%) and Tanzania (45%) maintained a positive attitude towards Russia.\n\nRegarding the Russian president, the center reported that worldwide, a median of 60% say they lack confidence in Putin\u2019s global leadership.\n\n\u200bA 2017 survey by the Worldwide Independent Network/Gallup International Association (WIN/GIA) did find the Russian president had gained ground, moving from a 33% favorability rating in 2015 to 43% in 2017 (with 40% that year holding an unfavorable opinion). But that plurality of support falls far short of a global embrace.\n\nIn January, Gallup International released its 41st Annual End of Year Survey. While that survey did find that Putin is globally more popular than U.S. President Donald Trump, majorities from India, Iraq, South Africa and nearly two dozen other countries \u201creject both Trump and Putin.\u201d\n\nAs noted by Gallup International Association (GIA) Vice President Andrey Milekhin: \u201cThe choice between these two Presidents is not an easy one and at the end the candidate \u2018against both\u2019 won.\u201d\n\nAs for Georgia, Simonyan\u2019s account of Burjanadze\u2019s warmth towards Putin doesn\u2019t erase the fact that 75% of Georgians have an unfavorable or very unfavorable attitude toward the Russian president, according to the results of a GORBI survey released this month.\n\nSo while global opinion on Putin and Russia is clearly mixed, claims that opposition to the Kremlin is the sole purview of the Western establishment are patently false.", "lang": "en"}
