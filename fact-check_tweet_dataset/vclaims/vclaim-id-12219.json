No, that's not true: the story was made up by a Canadian entertainment website that makes a living by publishing fictional stories often involving weird crimes, bizarre sex acts or strange accidents. It is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by World News Daily Report on January 30, 2019 titled \"Elderly couple accidentally burns house down during sex game involving WW2 flamethrower\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nSand Springs, Oklahoma | A couple's sexual game turned horribly wrong this morning, as they accidentally burned their house to the ground with a 75-year old flamethrower. Firefighters were called on the site around 11:15 this morning after receiving an unusual phone call but could do nothing to save the 45-year old house from being a total loss. Nancy Brown, the 911 operator who answered the call from 96-year old Maurice Fogerty, says she first thought she was dealing with pranksters when he told her he had \"torched the house with napalm while having sex with his wife\". \"He told me he was penetrating his wife with his M1, as usual, but got too excited and activated the flamethrower.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nBut the picture used with the story is just a still from a stock video:\n\nThe \"M1\" designation has been used by the U.S. military for a variety of things (for example a helmet, a rifle, a tank...) but also for a flamethrower so that part of the story checks out.\n\nBut the website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories. The disclaimer on their website is pretty clear about that even though you have to scroll all the way down the page to find it:\n\nOn March 20, 2019 the site added a new header that included the slogan \"Where facts don't matter\" to make it clearer to casual visitors the published content is fictional:\n\nIt is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run the satirical Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a satirical site spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al. Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes worldnewsdailyreport.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
