Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., said college students on average are graduating with $30,000 in student loan debt, we rated her claim . Some reliable data indicated the figure is accurate, but other figures suggested it might be lower.\n\nAnd when U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., claimed the affluent are taking advantage of student loans at the expense of middle-class families, our rating was . He overstated the problem on both ends.\n\nIn the governor\u2019s race, Democratic challenger Mary Burke has said easing student loan debt is one of her priorities. Her claim that there are 41,000 people on a waitlist for financial aid for Wisconsin technical colleges and universities earned a . The number wasn't totally firm, but pretty solid.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican Gov. Scott Walker has touted his tuition freeze at University of Wisconsin System schools rather than discussing college financial aid.\n\nBut on Oct. 27, 2014, the liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee, which has criticizing Walker, released making this claim:\n\n\"Scott Walker opposed a plan to help Wisconsin students refinance their student loans.\"\n\nIt turns out the Greater Wisconsin Committee doesn\u2019t have any proof that Walker opposed a state proposal to help students refinance student debt.\n\nRather, the group contends that since Walker didn\u2019t speak, or take action, in favor of the plan proposed by Democrats, he opposed it.\n\nWalker \"has had every opportunity to show support for this legislative proposal. He specifically chose not to express support and has instead avoided the topic altogether,\" the group\u2019s executive director, Rich Judge, told us in an email.\n\nJudge referred to in October 2013 to create a state student loan refinancing authority. Legislative committee hearings were held on the proposal in February 2014.\n\nBut no votes were ever taken by a committee or the full Legislature, so the issue never reached Walker\u2019s desk.\n\nJudge also noted that Walker refused an April 2014 request from Democrats to hold a special session of the Legislature. But he noted that request was to take up not only the refinancing proposal but a number of other bills, as well.\n\nFinally, Judge cited a September 2014 in the Green Bay Press-Gazette about a Walker campaign appearance.\n\nWalker did not speak specifically about student loan debt during the stop, but did say he prefers controlling tuition over government-subsidized financial aid, the newspaper reported. Walker was quoted as saying: \"We know it's not just about providing more financial assistance, it's about providing a great price for a UW education that's low to begin with.\"\n\nBut none of the above shows opposition by the governor to the refinance proposal.\n\nWe found another September 2014 in the Racine Journal Times. That article reported that Walker said he would be willing to look at measures like the refinancing bill, but questioned whether the proposal is \"more than just politics\" because Democrats had not enacted it when they controlled the Legislature and the governor\u2019s office prior to his election in 2010.\n\n\"If it was a good idea, I\u2019m sure they would have passed it four years ago when they controlled the Assembly and the Senate and the governorship,\" Walker was quoted as saying in response to questions from reporters. \"They not only did not do it then, they presided over a state government that saw 5.5 percent average annual increases in tuition.\"\n\nWalker certainly isn\u2019t declaring support for the refinancing authority, but he isn\u2019t stating opposition, either.\n\nThe Greater Wisconsin Committee says Walker \"opposed a plan to help Wisconsin students refinance their student loans.\"\n\nThe group acknowledged it has no evidence that Walker opposed a 2013 Democratic proposal to create a state student loan refinancing authority. Walker may not support the idea, but he hasn\u2019t fought it, either -- as the group claimed.", "lang": "en"}
