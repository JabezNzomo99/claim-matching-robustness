The facts, and a bevy of constitutional experts prove him wrong.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "January 18, 2019", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-37652", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/lavrov-congress-trump-constitution-fact-check/29716015.html", "vclaim": "During a Monday, January 16 press conference, CBS News Correspondent Elizabeth Palmer asked Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov if the Kremlin would share the content of meetings between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in the \u201cinterest of transparency.\u201d\n\nPalmer\u2019s question followed a Washington Post report that Trump had taken his interpreter's notes after a meeting with Putin at the 2017 Group of 20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, allegedly asking the interpreter not to discuss the talks with anyone.\n\nLavrov said that was difficult to comment on what is going on in the United States in regards to accusations that President Trump is \u201ca Russian agent,\u201d saying the story reflects \u201ca decline in journalistic standards.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot believe that journalists in the United States pursue these issues sincerely and professionally,\" Lavrov said.\n\nUnprompted, Lavrov then continued to comment on what he described as efforts by the U.S. Congress to undermine the U.S. president\u2019s right to determine and pursue his own foreign policy.\n\n\"We do know that this right has been coming under attack from Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cThe issue is covered extensively. However, this does not make these attacks constitutional, and it does not make them less illegal either. I will not comment on the administration\u2019s actions with regard to the powers the president and the administration have.\u201d\n\nWe put the question of whether the U.S. Congress has acted unconstitutionally and unlawfully to prevent President Trump from pursuing his own foreign policy to several constitutional scholars.\n\nMark Graber, an expert on constitutional law and politics at the University of Maryland\u2019s Carey School of Law, told Polygraph.info that while the U.S. president has distinct foreign policy powers, congressional actions have not been \u201cinterfering with the president\u2019s core powers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president has a core power to be commander in chief. Congress cannot tell him to adopt a military strategy,\u201d Graber said. \u201cThe main presidential powers [in foreign policy] deal with negotiating treaties and appointing ambassadors. Nothing congress has done has interfered with that.\u201d\n\nRobert Tsai, a law professor at American University, told Polygraph.info the original design of the U.S. Constitution \u201cenvisioned shared responsibility by the president and Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201c[The framers of the constitution] wanted to make it harder, for instance, for the country to get entangled militarily in another country by requiring congressional approval for war,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the power of the purse encompasses the ability to help set foreign policy by choosing to fund or defund foreign policy initiatives (for example, when Congress enacted the Boland Amendment to stop [President Ronald] Reagan from helping the Contras in Nicaragua, eventually leading to the Iran/Contra scandal),\u201d Tsai said.\n\nBoth Tsai and Graber noted that Congress, rather than overstepping their constitutional bounds in the foreign policy arena, have arguably done the opposite.\n\nGraber said he, in fact, had seen \u201ccongressional under-reach\u201d.\n\nTsai argued that \u201ccongressional passivity \u2026 has allowed presidents to assert more power,\u201d with some academics and lawyers arguing that the president should be granted \u201cinherent powers to unilaterally control parts of foreign policy.\u201d\n\nTsai said these defenders of a \u201cunitary executive\u201d theory are attempting to push the role of Commander in Chief \u201cas far as it can go,\u201d adding that \u201cmost people think this is a dangerous departure from the text and original design of the U.S. Constitution.\u201d\n\nRegarding Trump\u2019s communications with Putin and the ensuing scandal, Amanda Frost, a law professor at American University, said that while the president \u201chas some latitude to negotiate and discuss policy with foreign leaders,\u201d Congress likewise \u201chas the power to exercise oversight over the executive, and can ask for information about these meetings and negotiation.\u201d\n\nAnd despite Lavrov\u2019s belief in a culture of diplomacy and negotiations at the interstate-level that implies \u201cthe observance of decency\u201d and \u201cnorms which \u201cexist in each of the communicating states,\" Frost said that constitutionally, \u201coversight is an appropriate role for Congress, and that is what Congress is trying to do with regard to Trump\u2019s discussions with Putin.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not unusual for presidents and Congress to fight over the degree to which the office of President must disclose info to Congress. That is what is going on here. But there is no clear constitutional line regarding foreign policy that Congress has crossed, and the President does not have unilateral control over all of the nation\u2019s foreign policy, as the quote from the Russian foreign minister suggests,\u201d she said.\n\nLavrov did not provide more context for his comments. But they were delivered on the same day the U.S. Senate attempted (but ultimately failed) to advance a measure to stop the U.S. Treasury Department from easing sanctions on three Russian companies linked to Oleg Deripaska, whom AP described as being \u201camong two-three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis.\u201d\n\nBut as noted by Frost and Graber, Congress has the right to regulate Commerce with foreign nations under Article 1, section 8 of the constitution.\n\nThat, said Graber, includes the power to sanction foreign entities.\n\nBenjamin Alter, a J.D. candidate at Yale Law School, wrote that \u201csanctions are a foreign policy tool uniquely entrusted to Congress by the Constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnlike the other major levers of U.S. foreign policy\u2014diplomacy and military force, over which the Constitution divides control between Congress and the executive \u2014 the president has no inherent power to impose sanctions or to refuse to implement congressionally mandated sanctions,\u201d Alter said.\n\nTsai said that regardless, the president still has \u201cquite a lot of flexibility\u201d to set and shape policy, taking the initiative through the State Department and other institutions \u201ccreated for that purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are actually many laws that essentially give the president statutory authority to do everything from make exceptions to the admission of travelers and refugees (see the travel ban litigation) or commit troops but satisfy certain protocols (say the War Powers Act),\u201d he said. \u201cCongress is too fractured and transparent to be able to handle initiatives that require secrecy or dispatch, so everyday handling of most foreign affairs matters must be done by a president and his advisors.\u201d\n\nStill, Congress can defund initiatives, pass laws to clarify convoluted situations or \u201crefuse to approve the continued commitment of military resources or war,\u201d Tsai said.\n\nFrom a constitutional perspective, examples of congressional overreach during the Trump presidency in the realm of foreign policy have not been forthcoming.\n\nBut it should be noted that former officials from the Obama and George W. Bush administrations have warned that subpoenaing Trump\u2019s interpreter to testify before Congress would be, in the words of David Mortlock, director of international economic affairs at the White House National Security Council (NSC) under Obama, \u201ca bridge too far.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re at the center of diplomatic relationships and it raises concerns about whether you can truly have diplomatic communications,\u201d he said.\n\nWhether such a move would rise to the level of unlawfulness or unconstitutionality is up for debate.\n\nBut thus far, no such step has been taken.\n\nTherefore, Polygraph.info therefore finds Lavrov\u2019s comments to be false.", "lang": "en"}
