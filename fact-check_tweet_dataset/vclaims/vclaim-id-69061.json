The state\u2019s firefighting agency said it\u2019s had no complications accessing water, while fire experts said the state\u2019s hot, dry and windy conditions are to blame for the infernos, not any water policy.\n\nWith blazes continuing to ravage the state, we set out on a fact check. We focused on the first portion of the tweet about water policy.\n\nScott McLean, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection told us, it\u2019s the hot and dry conditions taking place earlier in the year that are leading to the extreme fires.\n\n\"We have had no issues accessing water to fight the fires,\" McLean wrote in an email. \"This year\u2019s changing weather pattern is leading to more severe and destructive wildfires.\"\n\nKeith Gilless is a UC Berkeley professor of forest economics and chairman of the California Board of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nHe said he believes Trump is conflating two very different issues. There\u2019s long been a conflict between farmers and environmental groups over how much water should go to crops versus rivers and lakes. But that fight hasn\u2019t had any effect on firefighting.\n\n\"I think there\u2019s some real confusion in the tweet,\" Gilless said. \"The issues over the allocation of water between environmental and agricultural interests have nothing to do with firefighting. And I\u2019m not aware of any situation in which those conflicts have restricted the availability of water for firefighting purposes.\"\n\nGilless said the reason California\u2019s wildfires are so destructive this year is the state\u2019s \"high heat, low relative humidity, high wind speeds and high fuel loading.\" He said climate change is making these conditions more frequent.\n\n\"California is going through a really heartbreaking fire season right now,\" he added. \"Environmental laws about water have nothing to do with it from my perspective.\"\n\nGilless said Trump\u2019s language about water \"being diverted into the Pacific Ocean,\" doesn\u2019t make sense, as water naturally flows to the ocean. The argument about how much water should be captured before it gets to the ocean, again, is part of a different, unrelated debate.\n\nThe second portion of Trump\u2019s tweet, that California \"Must also tree clear to stop fire spreading!\", is also confusing. Forestry experts say thinning trees is a well-established practice that can reduce the severity of fires. But clearing trees is more commonly associated with commercial logging practices, not fire management.\n\nLeroy Westerling, a UC Merced professor and wildfire specialist, told the San Francisco Chronicle that Trump\u2019s tweet, \"On the water side, it boggles the mind.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for evidence to support Trump\u2019s tweet.\n\nA day before the tweet, the Trump administration approved California's request to declare a \"major disaster\" as the state continues to fight wildfires that have claimed at least nine lives. The declaration makes federal funds available to residents of Shasta County, where the Carr Fire outside Redding, California, has destroyed more than 1,000 homes.\n\nPresident Trump claimed in a tweet that California\u2019s wildfires are \"made so much worse by the bad environmental laws\" which prevent firefighters from accessing water. He added in the tweet that water \"is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean.\"\n\nTrump appears to have conflated the state\u2019s real water controversy between farmers and environmentalists with the unrelated issue of firefighting. The state\u2019s fire agency, CalFire, said it has not had problems accessing water. And fire experts said it\u2019s the state\u2019s hot and bone-dry conditions, not environmental laws, that are making blazes more extreme.\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
