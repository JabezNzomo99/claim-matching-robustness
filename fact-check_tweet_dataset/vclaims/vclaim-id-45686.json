{"title": "FALSE: Photo of world's biggest anaconda in the Philippines", "subtitle": "There are no reports of such a sighting, and the photo was manipulated", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "Jun 3, 2020 6:00 PM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-45686", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/photo-world-biggest-anaconda-philippines", "vclaim": "An image of a large snake surrounded by people was posted on Facebook with the caption: \"[World's] biggest anaconda snake found in the Philippines in [Solar, Olutanga Island,] Zamboanga Sibugay province. [It] killed 752 human beings and [thousands] of animals. [It] is 135 feet long and 3 inches and about 3,000 kgs.\"\n\nThe photo has been posted several times even as early as 2015, and is being circulated again as of posting.\n\nThe facts: There are no reports of such a sighting in Zamboanga Sibugay, and the photo was manipulated.\n\nNo official news organizations have reported a large anaconda being found in the province of Zamboanga Sibugay, nor were there any reports of numerous deaths caused by an anaconda in this location.\n\nThe measurements provided are also exaggerated. According to National Geographic, South America's green anaconda is the largest snake in the world, and it can measure 20 to 30 feet and weigh up to 550 pounds or around 249.5 kilograms. This is a far cry from the 135-foot, 3,000-kilogram anaconda indicated in the claim.\n\nThe photo used to make the false claim has also been fact-checked by other organizations in the past. Factly and Snopes found that the photograph was manipulated from an image of a regular anaconda. \u2013 Loreben Tuquero/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
