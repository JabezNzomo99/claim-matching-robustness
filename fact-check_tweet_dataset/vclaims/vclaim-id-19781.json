Yet this increase is not especially unusual. If we look at those same three weeks in 2017, there was an even higher number of deaths compared to the five-year average, despite temperatures being lower.\n\nA key problem is that the data on weekly deaths is based on the date deaths were registered, and only 61% of deaths were registered within five days in 2016 (the most recent figure we have). We\u2019ll get a much better impression of mortality rates later in the year, when the ONS publishes more detailed information.\n\nWhat do the figures show?\n\nThe Guardian looked at data for the number of deaths recorded in England and Wales in a three-week period from 23 June to 13 July this year. It says that these weeks saw a run of 15 consecutive days (from 25 June to 9 July) where the temperature was above 28 degrees, according to the Met Office. The actual definition of a \u201cheatwave\u201d is quite technical, but it\u2019s fair to say that temperatures were unusually high in this period.\n\nAccording to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), there were just under 28,000 deaths registered in England and Wales from 23 June to 13 July this year. That\u2019s 663 more deaths than the average for the same weeks over the previous five years.\n\nHowever, such an increase is not so out of place when you look at the wider picture. There was in fact a bigger spike in deaths in the corresponding weeks of the year before: there were almost 1,200 more deaths in 2017 than the average for the previous five years. We don\u2019t know the exact temperatures on those days, but the June-July period was cooler on average last year than this year, and described as \u201cunsettled\u201d.\n\nPut another way, the number of deaths was 4% above the five-year average for those three weeks in 2017, compared to 2% above the average this year.\n\nLooking at the above graph, the number of deaths was further above the average during the \u201cheatwave\u201d weeks this year than any other summer weeks so far. But looking more broadly, the ONS points out that \u201cDespite an ageing and growing population, fewer deaths were registered\u201d during a seven-week period of abnormally warm, dry weather between 2 June and 20 July,\u201cthan during the same weeks of the last two years\u201d.\n\nIn general, the biggest fluctuations seem to come in the winter period, whilst figures across summer appear more stable. The number of weekly deaths also generally rises in winter and falls in summer.\n\nWere these deaths caused by the heatwave?\n\nWe won\u2019t know the full picture until later this year. \u201cWe cannot say whether any of these deaths are due to the heatwave or from other causes\u201d, an ONS spokesperson told the Guardian.\n\nA key problem is that the data on weekly deaths is not complete. It\u2019s based on the day on which a death was recorded, not the day it occurred\u2014and while most deaths are registered within five days, some will be missing from the data. In 2016, 61% of deaths were registered within five days (that\u2019s the most recent figure we have).\n\nThe ONS says that it will be able to produce more accurate figures by exact day of death later in the year.\n\nHigh temperatures have been linked to excess mortality in the past\n\nThe data also doesn\u2019t tell us the cause of death in all cases, but the ONS has previously linked increased numbers of deaths with abnormally high temperatures.\n\nIn 2016, the day in which the highest temperature of the year was recorded saw an extremely high number of deaths, compared to historical averages. The ONS said this \u201cmay explain the peak in mortality at this time\u201d. Something similar occurred in 2017.\n\nThe ONS also points to academic research which points to a relationship between extreme summer temperatures and excess mortality, especially among older people and children, and those with heart and lung diseases. The frequency and intensity of heatwaves is also predicted to increase as a result of climate change.\n\nSo we won\u2019t know the exact impact of this summer\u2019s high temperatures until later in the year, when we have more complete data.\n\nIn the meantime, look after yourself in the heat.", "lang": "en"}
