The caption that went with the photos read: \"Breaking news. Marami patay sa bakbakan ng PNP (Philippine National Police) at Drug Syndicate kagabi.\" (Breaking news. Many were killed in the encounter between PNP and drug syndicates last night.)\n\nThe facts: The photos were miscaptioned. A Google reverse image search showed that they were actually taken during the filming of ABS-CBN's Ang Probinsyano for its May 10, 2017 episode.\n\nThe scenes from an episode of Ang Probinsyano entitled \"Sakote\" showed the same, elements also found in the photos miscaptioned by Bicol Republic: two rows of actors as policemen and civilians lying dead on the ground and a police car and a white sedan opposite each other.\n\nCamille Rosales, Ang Probinsyano's executive producer, confirmed the photos were indeed taken during the shooting of Ang Probinsyano. The man at the upper left corner on the second photo posted by Bicol Republic, as also confirmed by Rosales, is actually Kevin Devela, one of the show's directors. A rolled script can be seen protruding from his short's pocket.\n\nThe Philippines' war on drugs is a policy that has been carried out since President Rodrigo Duterte assumed office on June 30, 2016. The Philippine National Police, with the initiative of then-PNP chief Ronald \"Bato\" dela Rosa, is the foremost government agency enforcing the crackdown on illegal drugs.\n\nAs of April 2019, there have been at least 20,322 reported killings by vigilantes and policemen across the Philippines. The policy has been criticized locally and internationally for the number of deaths and alleged extrajudicial killings that have resulted from it.
