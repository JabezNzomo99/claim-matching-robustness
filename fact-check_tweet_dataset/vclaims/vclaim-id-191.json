( here , here , here , here )\n\nThe illustration has also been shared in multiple languages including Catalan ( here ), French ( here ) Burmese( here ) and Spanish ( here ).\n\nThe diagram in the illustrations makes the following claims: There is a 70% contagion probability between a COVID-19 carrier not wearing a mask and a non-carrier wearing a mask; a 5% contagion probability between a COVID-19 carrier wearing a mask and a non-carrier not wearing a mask; and a 1.5% contagion probability between a COVID-19 carrier and a non-carrier both wearing masks.\n\nThis claim is not substantiated. Although some health authorities recommend the use of masks to help limit the spread of COVID-19, Reuters could not find any evidence to back up these percentages.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told Reuters via email that wearing masks is recommended as a way of strengthening social distancing, but they do not have data to measure how this affects the risk of transmission.\n\n\u201cCDC can\u2019t confirm the accuracy of the numbers reflected in this image. Currently we are not finding any data that can quantify risk reduction from the use of masks\u201d, a CDC spokesperson told Reuters.\n\nThe CDC has publicly said that cloth face coverings are \u201cnot intended to protect the wearer, but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others\u201d ( here ).\n\nThe CDC spokesperson said a cloth mask is a way to contain respiratory secretions right at the source. \u201cThe mask traps the droplets before they spread into the environment. Therefore, \u2018my mask protects you, and your mask protects me!\u2019 It\u2019s a way of strengthening the social distancing that we are already doing\u201d, she said.\n\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control states: \u201cIt is not known how much the use of masks in the community can contribute to a decrease in transmission in addition to the other countermeasures\u201d and stresses the use of masks should only be considered as \u201ccomplementary\u201d and not as a replacement for other established preventive measures. ( here )\n\nAs of April 22, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) continues to advise that the use of face masks alone is \u201cinsufficient to provide an adequate level of protection\u201d. On a recent update to its guidelines ( bit.ly/3aueKzh ), the WHO warned of potential risks for healthy people wearing masks in community settings, including \u201cself-contamination by touching and reusing (a) contaminated mask\u201d and \u201cfalse sense of security, leading to potentially less adherence to other preventive measures such as physical distancing and hand hygiene\u201d.\n\nPartly false: There is no data available to quantify risk reduction from the use of masks but they are recommended by some authorities, including the CDC in the United States, as a supplementary measure to strengthen other preventive steps such as social distancing and frequent handwashing.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
