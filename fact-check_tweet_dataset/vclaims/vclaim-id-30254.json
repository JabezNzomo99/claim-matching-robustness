While he\u2019s right about the statistic, the improved death rate is the result of decades-long efforts on cancer prevention, detection and treatment.\n\nIn fact, the cancer death rate has declined every year since 1991.\n\nIn a Jan. 9 tweet, Trump appeared to reference the results of a newly released set of cancer statistics from the American Cancer Society when he bragged about the nation\u2019s cancer mortality rate, adding, \u201cA lot of good news coming out of this Administration.\u201d\n\nThe White House did not reply to our request asking about a source for the president\u2019s comment. But the day before his Twitter message, the flagship journal of the American Cancer Society published its annual update of cancer statistics for the U.S.\n\nThe report, which was widely publicized, noted the continuing decline of the all-cancer mortality rate in the U.S., and said that the 2.2% drop in the death rate from 2016 to 2017 was the largest single-year decline. Cancer deaths fell from just under 156 per 100,000 people in 2016 to a bit over 152 deaths in 2017 \u2014 which is the most recent year for mortality data.\n\nThe report did not specifically state that the 2017 death rate was the lowest on record, but we checked with the lead author of the report, cancer epidemiologist Rebecca Siegel, who confirmed in an email that it was. Going back to 1930, which is when the American Cancer Society begins tracking cancer mortality, \u201cthe rate in 2017 is lower than ever before for both sexes combined,\u201d she said, although the death rate is not yet the lowest for males individually.\n\nContrary to Trump\u2019s intimation, however, the death rate improvement is a product of years of effort coming to fruition, not his administration\u2019s one year of being in office.\n\n\u201cThe mortality trends reflected in our current report, including the largest drop in overall cancer mortality ever recorded from 2016 to 2017, reflect prevention, early detection, and treatment advances that occurred in prior years,\u201d Gary M. Reedy, CEO of the American Cancer Society, said in a statement provided to us.\n\nReedy added that while Trump has signed spending bills that have provided funding increases to the National Institutes of Health and the National Cancer Institute, \u201cthe impact of those increases are not reflected in the data contained in this report.\u201d\n\nIt should be noted that while Trump has approved budget increases for cancer research, he has consistently proposed cuts to the NIH and the NCI, the government\u2019s main agency responsible for cancer research and training.\n\nIn fiscal year 2020, for example, Trump proposed a nearly $900 million, or 15%, decrease to NCI \u2014 one of the largest proposed cuts within the NIH. Congress, however, did not go along, and instead increased the NCI\u2019s budget by almost $300 million.\n\nTrump has focused his support for cancer research on childhood cancers, announcing a $500 million, decade-long initiative in his 2019 State of the Union speech. The president\u2019s fiscal 2020 budget request for the NIH included a $50 million increase in pediatric cancer research, even as it called for a deep cut in NCI\u2019s overall funding.\n\nThe most recent drop in the cancer death rate is part of a now 26-year decline in the overall cancer mortality rate, which has fallen 29% since the peak rate in 1991, the new American Cancer Society report says.\n\nFor males, the cancer death rate peaked much higher than for females, but has since declined more rapidly. That\u2019s in part due to historical differences in cigarette smoking; American females picked up the habit later, but also have been slower to quit.", "lang": "en"}
