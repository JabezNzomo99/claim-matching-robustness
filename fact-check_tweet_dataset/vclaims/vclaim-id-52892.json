The tweets which were allegedly posted a few hours before his death, and subsequently deleted, talk about his mental health and why he is ending his life. You can view the archived version here. One of the viral tweets read: \u201cI'm ending all this for good. Going far yet so close to you people. Maybe after this people try to communicate with others rather than holding onto the thoughts. See ya at the other side. GoodBye (sic).\u201d Hindi News channel Aaj Tak also carried a story on these tweets. However, the story has now been taken down. You can view the archived version here. An organisation which goes by the name of \u2018Newstrack\u2019 too published an article on the same. You can view the archived version here.\n\nThe tweets have also been shared on Facebook. You can view the archived version here. The Quint received multiple queries on the claim being made in the tweets on its WhatsApp helpline. Did Rahul Gandhi Call Sushant Singh a Cricketer? No, Tweet is Fake There are a number of red flags in the tweets which make it evident that the screenshots are fake. Let\u2019s take a look at them one by one: 1. DIFFERENT FONTS USED IN ONE TWEET If one notices carefully, there are different fonts being used in the viral tweet as far as the dateline, name of the Twitter user and text of the tweet are concerned. When one changes the font on an Android phone, the font of the entire tweet changes and not just one element. We tried it on an Android phone as the screenshots mention \u2018Twitter for Android\u2019. The screenshot of the viral tweet has a different font for the username and the date line while the tweet\u2019s text font id different. The second red flag was the dateline itself. The date mentioned in the tweet reads \u201814 jun 20\u2019 which is not the format. A tweet when viewed on the desktop has the dateline written as Jun 12, 2020, on Tweetdeck it reads 12 Jun 2020 while on the mobile app it reads 12 Jun 20. Now the only time the letter \u2018J\u2019 can be in lower case is when we change the language settings. But on doing that, the language of the below mentioned \u2018View Tweet Activity\u2019 shall also change which didn\u2019t happen in this case.\n\nWhile changing the language, Twitter prompts a message that reads: \u201cSelect your preferred language for headlines, buttons, and other text from Twitter on this account. This does not change the language of the content you see in your timeline.\u201d This states that while the language of the content remains unchanged, all other text from Twitter changes. We changed the languages and saw that both the datelines and \u2018View Tweet Activity\u2019 have been changed. We changed the language on Twitter and found that several Twitter elements read differently. We also compared the gap between the Twitter handle and text of the viral tweet with another tweet shared by an android phone. We noticed that the gap is way more in the viral tweet as compared to the one seen in a tweet on mobile, TweetDeck and desktop view. We compared the gap in the viral tweet to the one seen in an authentic tweet on mobile, TweetDeck and desktop view. TikTok Video Falsely Viral as Last Clip of Sushant Singh Rajput Also, as per Sushant Singh Rajput\u2019s Twitter profile, his last tweet was on 27 December 2019. We also viewed the archived history of the account on an application called \u2018Wayback Machine\u2019 and didn't find any tweet which was posted after that. It can be argued that the tweets might have been deleted but as proven above, these screenshots are manipulated and don\u2019t show the late actor\u2019s last tweet.", "lang": "en"}
