The GOP plan for Medicare has since been revised, making it bizarre and misleading to keep repeating this claim.\n\nThe official back-up for this ad cites, among others, this statement from Boehner, made on CNN in October. \u201cMy goal here is to have a serious conversation about those things that are driving the deficit and driving the debt up. We know these programs are important to tens of millions of Americans. But if we don\u2019t address the underlying problems, they are not sustainable.\u201d\n\nAnd why is Social Security even on the table? Because President Obama put it in his budget for fiscal year 2014. He included a proposal to change how Social Security benefits are adjusted for inflation, which would result in a reduction in anticipated cost of living increases.\n\nSocial Security benefits, unlike virtually all annuities, is adjusted every year to keep pace with inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index. Thus benefits are always increasing, making it very valuable to retirees \u2014 but also a big part of the federal budget. (For more on Social Security, read our popular primer on the program.)\n\nUnder the president\u2019s plan, a different version of the consumer price index would be used, something called \u201cchained CPI\u201d that attempts to account for the fact that when prices rise, people may substitute an equivalent but lower-priced item. The shift appears to be modest \u2014 0.3 percentage points per year \u2014 but over time the shift could be profound.\n\nThe White House, when it released the budget, claimed that it was included because it was Republican proposal and Obama wanted to jump-start negotiations, though the evidence that this originated with Republicans is rather murky. (McConnell did mention chained CPI in a television interview as an indication that Obama was serious about reducing mandatory spending; Boehner implicitly referenced in a letter to Obama by urging a proposal, along the lines of a new plan advanced by Erskine Bowles, as an \u201cimperfect, but fair middle ground.\u201d Bowles, incidentally, is a Democrat and former chief of staff to former president Bill Clinton.)\n\nRestraining growth in Social Security thus is considered an important policy issue, but both sides play political games with it. The White House claims it included Social Security in its budget because Republicans wanted to discuss it; Republicans say they want to discuss it because the president put it in his budget.\n\n\u201cThis ad is about Mitch McConnell and John Boehner, and their willingness to continually put cuts to Medicare and Social Security on the table,\u201d said Ty Matsdorf of Patriot Majority USA. \u201cThey both have repeatedly made clear that they want to cut Social Security and Medicare \u2013 by supporting the [House GOP] budget, by going on the record when they purport to negotiate the budget and even by using the risk of default as a bargaining tool to cut both programs. It\u2019s their plan, period.\u201d\n\nIt is correct that Republican leaders have wanted to include reductions in entitlement programs as part of budget talks, but it\u2019s absurd to brush aside the fact that Obama, in his budget plan, also has a specific proposal to reduce Social Security spending. We take no position on whether the cuts would be \u201cpainful,\u201d except to note that the changes in Social Security would be barely noticeable at first to many beneficiaries.", "lang": "en"}
