No, that's not true: The speech quoted in misleading stories included the pope quoting a biblical passage in which Jesus responds to a question about the nature of the Kingdom of God by saying \"It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened\" (Luke 13:18.21). While yeast is technically a fungus, the implication that the head of the Catholic Church was comparing Christians to a fungus is false.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on April 4, 2019 titled \"Pope Francis Compares Christians To Fungus; Hails Muslims As 'Sons of Abraham'\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nPope Francis has praised Muslims as \"sons of Abraham\" while comparing Christians to a microscopic single-cell fungus, during a bizarre speech in Morocco, a North African nation with a 99 percent Muslim majority. After ordering Christians in the nation not to convert Muslims to the gospel of Christ, Pope Francis said God wants Christians to be like \"yeast\" and promoted his idea of \"inter-faith brotherhood\", before defending his recent track record of visiting Muslim states.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nPope Francis delivered his message on Sunday, March 31, 2019, on the second day of his historic visit to Morocco. Christians are a tiny minority in the Northern African country where 99 percent of the population is Muslim, with sub-Saharan Africans making up a large part of the country's 30,000-strong Catholic community, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\nFrancis offered advice to the Christian minority that they should not try to convert Muslims in Morocco to Christianity, because it would only lead to an \"impasse,\" the AFP reported.\n\nIt was in this context that Francis quote the passage from the book of Luke:\n\nChristians are a small minority in this country. Yet, to my mind, this is not a problem, even though I realize that at times it can be difficult for some of you. Your situation reminds me of the question asked by Jesus: \"What is the kingdom of God like? And to what should I compare it? ... It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened\" (Lk 13:18.21). Paraphrasing the Lord's words, we can ask ourselves: What are Christians like, in these lands? To what can we compare them? They are like a little yeast that Mother Church wants to mix in with a great quantity of flour until all of it is leavened. For Jesus did not choose us and send us forth to become more numerous! He called us to a mission. He put us in the midst of society like a handful of yeast: the yeast of the Beatitudes and the fraternal love by which, as Christians, we can all join in making present his kingdom. In this context I recall the counsel of Saint Francis to his brothers as he sent them out: \"Go out and preach the Gospel: and if necessary, also with words\".\n\nThe full transcript of the pope's message can be read here on the Vatican website.\n\nThe NewsPunch story concluded with the the statement that Pope Francis \"is a leading player in the plot to usher in a New World Order, determined to mislead his flock while serving the global cabal.\"\n\nNewsPunch (formerly YourNewsWire) has published several hoaxes and fake news articles in the past so anything they write or publish should be taken with a large grain of salt.
