Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Video of Muslims rally in support of CAA in Kerala. Fact: The posted video is an old one. The same video is in circulation on the internet since May-2019. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through the Google Reverse Image Search, a lot of similar videos were found in the search results. It can be seen that one of those videos was uploaded on YouTube in May-2019. The video had the following title: \u2018Muslims Celebrate on PM Narendra Modi Victory from Varanasi in 2019 Loksabha Polls\u2019. While it cannot be ascertained whether the video is related to Varanasi, with the available information, it is definitely not related to any recent rallies related to CAA and NRC.\n\nTo sum it up, an old video is being falsely shared as \u2018Muslims rally in support of CAA in Kerala\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
