The debate over net neutrality is highly technical and complex, and much of the disagreement is over sausage-making technicalities of utility regulation. But these two claims stand out because they refer to something that\u2019s easy to comprehend: How much it will cost the consumer?\n\nThe FCC is weighing whether to reclassify broadband Internet access as a \u201ccommon carrier\u201d under Title II of the Telecommunications Act. This change would ensure \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d proponents say, because it would give equal access to the Internet. It would prohibit Internet service providers, such as Comcast, from making agreements with Web sites, such as Netflix, to provide faster and more reliable connection for subscribers to stream movies and TV shows.\n\nThe authors noted their original analysis \u201cdid not consider state law limitations on the application of taxes and fees to jurisdictionally mixed services that are classified as interstate for regulatory purposes.\u201d This is important because the FCC could designate broadband as an interstate service, rather than a service that can be contained within state geographical boundaries. If that happens, the intrastate state and local fees in the analysis would not apply.\n\nSome experts say it\u2019s a stretch, if not flatly inaccurate, to consider 911 fees in the calculation. State or local 911 fees tend to be intrastate and are designed to recover a specific amount needed to run 911 call centers. The demand for 911 service is not contingent on the federal classification for Internet service changes. When we raised this to Singer, he said 911 fees are a modest portion of the state and local fees and would not decrease the $11 billion figure significantly.\n\n\u201cThe point of the study is that reclassification puts 911 fees \u2014 and all of these other telecom-related fees \u2014 on the radar,\u201d Singer said, and tax administrators could try to charge all of them. He also noted that some state and local governments are levying taxes and regulatory fees on wireless phone services (called Voice over Internet Protocol, or VoIP \u2014 an example of this is Vonage), regardless of the interstate designation.\n\nA main critic of the study is Free Press, an organization that advocates for open Internet. Free Press and other open-Internet advocates say consumers will not see \u201ceven a penny more\u201d on their bills as a result of reclassification. (There is a lot of back-and-forth on this, for those who want to dive into the wonkery.)\n\nThe reality may be somewhere in between. Tax and regulation experts interviewed by The Fact Checker had varying views on how much the FCC reclassification would cost consumers, and whether all consumers would see an increase in their bills. But they agreed it likely will cost some consumers something, depending on the final FCC definition and how individual state and local taxing jurisdictions react.\n\nStates have challenged some tax exemptions under ITFA in court, especially as landline revenues decline. If the FCC decides to reclassify, there likely will be more litigation to challenge what states or local governments can charge, experts said. \u201cThat leaves room for states to be more or less aggressive, depending on their politics toward taxpayers and what fiscal crises they may be facing,\u201d said Michael Dillon, tax attorney and expert on ITFA.\n\nThe Fact Checker asked aides of Blackburn and Norquist why they used the $15 billion number after it was modified, and given the caveats. Blackburn\u2019s spokesperson did not respond. John Kartch, from Americans for Tax Reform, said: \u201cThe piece referenced the PPI study, so we are dependent on what PPI would say on the difference between the numbers. The point of the op-ed is equally valid whether the number is $15 billion or $11 billion \u2014 taxpayers are getting the shaft either way.\u201d\n\nIt is impossible to quantify the exact impact of the potential FCC decision, since Internet regulation is a new area of policy. New taxes are prohibited as long as the Internet Tax Freedom Act is in effect, so it is inaccurate to say there would be $15 billion in new taxes. There may be state charges and fees, but there is no proof that all of the current fees on telephone services would apply again to Internet services. It will not add up to $15 billion, and likely not add up to $11 billion \u2014 the worst-case scenario. The researchers agree it is a \u201chigh-end\u201d estimate, which was the purpose of the report.\n\nThere are too many unknowns to alarm consumers who are not well-versed in the technical and legal details of telecommunications regulations and laws. Given the uncertainties, it would be more appropriate to give a range of potential charges. But the researchers did not calculate a low-end figure for the report. In addition, the modification from $15 billion to $11 billion is a 27 percent decrease, yet the change is buried in a footnote and not readily visible for the public.", "lang": "en"}
