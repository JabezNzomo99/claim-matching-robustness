But the natural comparison isn\u2019t with the total annual rise under seven years of Conservative-led government. In fact, pensions rose by more under Labour, on average, once you take inflation into account.\n\nIn simple cash terms, the full basic state pension rose by \u00a3141 a year on average under Labour compared to \u00a3183 a year under the Coalition and Conservative governments.\n\nBut as we\u2019ve noted when assessing Ms May\u2019s headline figure in isolation, this takes no account of price inflation. When taking the natural rise in prices (as measured by the Consumer Prices Index) into account, we see a different story.\n\nIn real terms, the full basic state pension went from roughly \u00a34,800 a year in April 1997 to \u00a35,800 a year in April 2010. So, on average, every year of the Labour government saw an increase of \u00a382 in real terms. The real value of that pension under the Conservatives went from \u00a35,800 to \u00a36,400\u2014an average annual rise of \u00a375 a year.\n\nThe Conservatives\u2019 record is slightly better than Labour\u2019s if you don\u2019t count the latest year\u2014the real terms increase between 2010 and 2016 was \u00a385 a year on average.\n\nNone of this is relevant to anyone retiring after 6 April 2016, as the basic state pension we\u2019ve been discussing has been replaced with a new state pension scheme for more recent retirees. And we\u2019ve been looking at the full amount of the basic state pension, which not everybody will be entitled to.", "lang": "en"}
