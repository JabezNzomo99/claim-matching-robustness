The person at the center of the story isn't even a CNN journalist.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The awards were for German-language journalism and decided by an independent jury. The last awards were given in 2015, CNN reported.\n\nIn a statement to the Associated Press, CNN International said the independent panel of judges who awarded Relotius the awards decided unanimously to remove them following revelations about his fraud.\n\nThe story about the incident on the website The Federalist Papers isn't inaccurate. But it includes a purposively deceptive image of a top CNN correspondent to bait readers on Facebook into clicking on the story itself. Readers seeing the post caught the deception, but only after clicking on the item.\n\n\"Carolyn McKnight Langdon Wow, the hypocrisy.... Isn't putting the face of Acosta on this article link (about a German reporter) equal to the kinds of Truth spinning shenanigans CNN is often accused of?\"\n\n \n\n \"Ellie Merritt How much more misleading can you get? Had I not seen the Federalist banner, I would have sworn this was another misleading CNN article. Shame on you.\"\n\n\"Chris Domenico Dang it....ya got me. I kept telling myself \"don\u2019t click, it\u2019s not what you think\", yet I clicked. Hat\u2019s off to you....\"\n\nA story from The Federalist Papers with the headline \"CNN Journalist Of The Year Fired For Creating Fake News Stories,\" is being shared on social media with a photo of CNN reporter Jim Acosta.\n\nThe post is misleading clickbait. Acosta has nothing to do with the story, and the journalist fired doesn't work for CNN. Readers caught on to the gimmick if they read the full story.\n\nOverall, we rate this claim Half True.", "lang": "en"}
