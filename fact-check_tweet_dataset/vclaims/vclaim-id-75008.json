They would meet at 4:20,\" in the afternoon, according to a short history behind the holiday. The time and date are now a core part of popular marijuana culture.\n\nVoters approved Proposition 64 in 2016, which allowed retail sales to start in January. It added California to what is currently a list of nine states, plus Washington D.C., where recreational marijuana is legal.\n\nBut just how many people in the United States can legally use marijuana, in some form, on \"4/20\" or any other day?\n\n\"A majority of Americans now live in states where they have decided to legalize cannabis.\"\n\nRight before that, he noted that more states have approved medical marijuana than recreational pot.\n\nStill, we wondered: Was Chiang right that a majority of Americans live in states that have decided to legalize cannabis? Or was he blowing smoke?\n\nWe set out on a fact check.\n\nPot 101: Facts you should know about California\u2019s legal marijuana\n\nHow much privacy do you have when you buy marijuana in California?\n\nTRUE: During campaign, Trump pledged to leave marijuana legalization up to states\n\nChiang, a Democrat who is running for governor, made his claim in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on March 29, 2018. He urged Sessions to establish federal banking rules for the cannabis industry. The letter was signed by state treasures from Oregon, Illinois and Pennsylvania, as well as several cannabis industry representatives.\n\nMarijuana remains illegal, in all forms, under federal law.\n\nIn January, Sessions rescinded an Obama administration memo that recommended a hands-off approach to marijuana prosecution in states that have legalized pot. The move was seen as possibly paving the way for a federal crackdown on marijuana users and suppliers, though it\u2019s uncertain whether that will happen.\n\nDifferent types of marijuana sit on display at Harborside marijuana dispensary, Monday, Jan. 1, 2018, in Oakland, Calif.

It includes a map based on information from the National Conference of State Legislatures showing 44 states have some form of legal marijuana, ranging from adult recreational use to medical use to \"limited medical\" use in several states allowing \"cannabis extracts.\"\n\nBased on that map, the vast majority of Americans do live in states that have decided to legalize cannabis.\n\nBut it\u2019s also the broadest collection of states we found and stretches the case on whether a state has really legalized any form of marijuana.\n\nWe decided to limit our count to states where voters or a state legislature has approved a comprehensive law authorizing medical or recreational marijuana.\n\nWe found 29 states, plus Washington D.C., that meet that criteria, based on news reports. Nine have legalized recreational marijuana while the rest have legalized medical marijuana.\n\nEven with this smaller group of states, however, Chiang\u2019s statement holds up. There are more than 207 million people in these states, based on our review of census data.\n\nCalifornia Treasurer John Chiang recently claimed: \"A majority of Americans now live in states where they have decided to legalize cannabis.\"\n\nHis office pointed to a report that shows 44 states have some form of legal marijuana, though that list includes some states with only \"limited medical marijuana\" legalization and no comprehensive law authorizing the use.\n\nIn reality, 29 states, plus Washington D.C., have passed laws authorizing recreational marijuana, medical marijuana or both.\n\nBut even with this smaller group, Chiang\u2019s statement is correct. That\u2019s because more than 200 million Americans live in these states, representing a clear majority of the country\u2019s 325 million people.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
