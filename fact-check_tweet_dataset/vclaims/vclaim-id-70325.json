The post consists of a \u201cbefore\u201d photo showing the dire state the boy was found in by aid worker Anja Ringgren Loven and an \u201cafter\u201d photo which it says is her cuddling the same child, now a healthy toddler. AFP has established that the photos show two different boys, and that while the malnourished toddler was rescued, he was never adopted by Loven.\n\nThe misleading post has been shared widely on multiple social media platforms including this Facebook group that has over 270,000 followers and describes itself as a platform that makes Kenyan memes trend.\n\nThe after photo shows a healthy boy whose complexion and demeanor seems to have changed since he was rescued from the street in Nigeria.\n\nA caption on the December 5, 2018 post reads: \u201cSome months back in Nigeria one naked and dying 2-year abandoned child was seen being fed by a lady charity-worker from Denmark - Anja Ringgren Loven, that pic went viral in social media. She later adopted that child and named him Hope. today, Hope looks like this.\"\n\nThe same post was shared on this Twitter handle that has 345,000 followers, attracting an array of reactions and comments.\n\n\n\nAFP contacted Tina Ringgren Loven, who is Anja Ringgren Loven's twin sister and head of fundraising at DINN\u00f8dhj\u00e6lp, an NGO in Nigeria.\n\nTina Ringgren Loven told AFP that Hope was never adopted by her sister.\n\nThe boy was however rehabilitated at her sister\u2019s children centre, which she runs with her Nigerian husband David Emmanuel Umem.\n\n\"(Anja Ringgren) Loven has not adopted Hope. She rescued him and he is now living at Land of Hope, which is a children\u2019s center in Nigeria that Anja and her husband David founded,\" Tina said.\n\nThe \u201cafter\u201d picture that purported to reveal how Hope had transformed after the rescue was, in fact, that of Loven\u2019s son, David Jr, being held by his aunt, Maria.\n\n\u201cThe picture on the right is a picture of Loven\u00b4s niece named Maria, and the boy Maria is holding is Loven\u00b4s son David Jr. The claims made in the attached post is false,\u201d Tina told AFP.\n\nOne year after Hope was taken into the orphanage, Loven recreated the day she rescued him with a photoshoot, reporting he was now healthy and going to school.\n\nHere is a video of what the boy looked like a year after his rescue, as shared by Anja\u2019s husband.", "lang": "en"}
