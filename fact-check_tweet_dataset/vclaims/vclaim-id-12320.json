Please register yourself on https://eci.gov.in Please spread the news in different groups,\u201d the Whatsapp message with Election Commission logo read.\n\nBOOM analysed the message and found out that copy pasting the EC's website URL pulls in the logo in WhatsApp, a common trick by hoax creators to lend credibility to fake messages.\n\nCurrently, the 30 million Indians residing outside are not eligible for voting in Indian elections other than if they come in person to their respective polling booths.\n\nIn 2013, Dr Shamsheer Vayalil, UAE-based doctor and chairman of VPS Healthcare, along with Nagender Chindam of United Kingdom, who filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Supreme Court seeking e-voting rights for NRIs.\n\nIn July 2018, Attorney General KK Venugopal had told the Supreme Court that NRIs could not be allowed to vote by merely changing the rules made under the Representation of People Act and a Bill was needed to be introduced.\n\nThe Supreme Court had asked the Centre to decide whether it would amend the electoral law or rules to allow NRIs to vote by postal or e-ballots in the polls in the country.\n\nTo enable NRIs to vote the Representation of People Act 1950 and Representation of People Act 1951 had to be amended.\n\nThe 1950 Act deals with the allocation of seats and delimitation of constituencies for elections, qualifications of voters and preparation of electoral rolls.\n\nThe 1951 Act provides for the conduct of elections and offenses and disputes related to elections. Section 20A of the 1950 Act recognizes the right of an NRI to have her name entered in the electoral roll.\n\nHowever, the right to vote is exercisable only in person.\n\nFortunately, in order to allow proxy voting by NRIs, Section 60 of the 1951 Act was amended by the Bill, by adding a sub-section.\n\nIt is that Section 60 which enables the Election Commission of India (ECI) to frame rules to allow the special procedure for voting by a special class of persons.\n\nAnd the Bill was passed in August 2018 in Lok Sabha.\n\nHowever, Rajya Sabha session held between January 31 and February 13, this year failed to discuss and pass the Bill.\n\nThis week following the spread of fake news, Sheyphali Sharan, the official spokesperson of Election Commission of India, had also tweeted that \u201cIt has come to our notice that the following FAKE NEWS is circulating on some WhatsApp groups.\n\n\u201cIt is clarified that you can only apply for voter registration online through nvsp.in portal,\u201d the tweet added.\n\n\u201cTo cast vote, an overseas voter may come to his/her designated Polling station with Passport as document for identification,\u201d the official spokesperson added in a following tweet.", "lang": "en"}
