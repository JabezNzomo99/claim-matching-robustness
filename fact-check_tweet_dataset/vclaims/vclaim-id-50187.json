Amid this, an aerial shot of a huge region submerged in floodwater is being circulated on social media with the claim that it is from Bihar.\n\nThe picture has been shared along with a sarcastic caption that says, \u201cExclusive image of Bihar after the investment of 1.25 Lakh Crore as promised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\u201d\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that this particular picture is from Kolhapur in Maharashtra, and was taken last year.\n\nThe claim was originally posted on Twitter and its screenshot is being widely shared on Facebook. The archived version can be seen here.\n\nReverse-searching the viral image, we found it in an article by \u201cBBC News\u201d published in August last year. In this report, the image was used in a video about the flood situation in Maharashtra and Karnataka.\n\nTaking a cue from this, we searched for flood images from the two states from last year. We found an article by \u201cHindustan Times\u201d where the image was used. The caption of the picture says, \u201cHundreds of villages in Kolhapur and neighbouring Sangli were flooded after heavy rains in August.\u201d\n\nBihar is fighting the twin scourge of floods and the Covid-19 pandemic. At a time the whole state is under lockdown, over three lakh people in eight districts in north Bihar have been affected by the floods.\n\nThe eight affected districts are Darbhanga, East Champaran, Muzaffarpur, Gopalganj, Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Supaul and Kishanganj. Over 100 villages have been reportedly inundated in Darbhanga alone, one of the worst affected districts due to the floods.\n\nNews agency ANI has shared some latest images of the flood situation in Bihar.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that while the flood situation in Bihar is indeed grim, the viral aerial shot being passed off as from the state is not true. It is an old image from last year\u2019s floods in Maharashtra.", "lang": "en"}
