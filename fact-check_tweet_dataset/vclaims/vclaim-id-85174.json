About three weeks before the U.S. election on Nov. 8, SoftBank announced its plans for a technology investment fund of up to $100 billion, named the SoftBank Vision Fund. SoftBank signed an agreement to make Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign-wealth fund the lead partner. Over five years, SoftBank plans to contribute at least $25 billion to the fund, with Saudi Arabia\u2019s fund investing up to $45 billion and an additional $30 billion from other investors.\n\nAfter Trump and Son met on Dec. 6, they spoke to reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower. Trump said of Son: \u201cHe\u2019s just agreed to invest $50 billion in the United States and 50,000 jobs. And he\u2019s one of the great men of industry, so I just want to thank you.\u201d Son repeated his commitment and said he would create 50,000 jobs by investing in start-up companies in the United States. Son told reporters that he came to celebrate Trump\u2019s election and that Trump \u201cwould do a lot of deregulation.\u201d\n\nSon told the Journal that the $50 billion will come from the $100 billion SoftBank Investment Fund. It\u2019s not yet clear how much of the $50 billion headed to the United States would come from SoftBank, the Saudi fund or other investors. SoftBank declined to comment further on whether, or how much, the company planned to invest in the U.S. before Trump\u2019s election. A Trump spokesman offered this comment: \u201cPresident-elect Trump\u2019s tweet speaks for itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome investors and analysts have said he could make another attempt after Mr. Trump\u2019s election and when a new chairman is appointed to the Federal Communications Commission. Mr. Son planned to tell Mr. Trump about what happened with T-Mobile, and how he had wanted to invest in the U.S. but the regulatory climate was too harsh so he invested outside the U.S. instead, the person familiar with the matter said.\u201d\n\nAnalysts in Japan and the United States suggested that Son may have had plans to invest in the United States anyway regardless of the election but decided that Trump\u2019s election was the time to announce it, sensing U.S. regulations may change to his favor under the Trump administration. The Mainichi, a major Japanese daily newspaper, wrote that some analysts in Japan believe Son has high expectations for regulatory policies to change under Trump.\n\nThe Journal noted that SoftBank \u201cannounced the $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund nearly a month before the election, when most pundits expected Mr. Trump to lose. Given its size, the fund was likely to put most of its money in the U.S., still home to the world\u2019s most-promising technology companies. Last quarter, 60% of the money raised by companies backed by venture capital was in North America, according to a report by KPMG and CB Insights.\u201d\n\n\u201cSon must have intended as much as half of the Vision Fund to go to the U.S., as he\u2019s aware that there are great companies in Silicon Valley. But he chose this time to announce it as Trump is now going to be the next president,\u201d Jun Tanabe, a SoftBank analyst at JPMorgan Securities in Tokyo, told The Post. Tanabe said that it is not rare to invest in the United States but that it was surprising that the announcement committed to specific dollar figures and numbers of jobs.\n\nAnalysts in Japan and the United States say a mix of factors led to Son\u2019s announcement of his U.S. investments after Trump\u2019s meeting. The United States leads the world in venture capital investments and has some of the most promising tech companies and start-ups. So it is likely that Son already had planned on investing in U.S. companies, no matter who won the presidential election.\n\nAfter all, the $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund was announced three weeks before the U.S. elections, when Trump faced a narrow path to victory. The United States outpaces all other countries in venture capital investments, and it is questionable that none of the $100 billion would have gone to the vibrant and promising tech industry in America, regardless of whether Trump was elected.\n\nThere are too many unknowns right now for us to issue a rating. Neither Trump nor Son has revealed all the details of the conversation. SoftBank has not yet clarified whether or how much the company intended to invest in the U.S. technology industry before Trump\u2019s election. But count us among those who are dubious of Trump\u2019s claim that Son attributed the election as the sole catalyst for the company\u2019s investment in the U.S. tech industry. We will update this rating if new and relevant information emerges. But, in the meantime, readers should be wary of the spin.", "lang": "en"}
