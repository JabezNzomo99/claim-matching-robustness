It shows me that you do not respect your star,\u201d the article quotes him as saying in a letter to the NBA. \u201cAnd this after all I\u2019ve selflessly done for you. I DEMAND THAT THIS NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.\u201d\n\nIn October 2019, James faced backlash for yelling \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d during the national anthem before the season opener against the Los Angeles Clippers, according to the Washington Examiner. The satire article appears to draw inspiration from that incident.\n\nYet, while Bustatroll.org clearly disclaims the satirical nature of its content, USA News and Gamertwin.com portray James\u2019 ultimatum about the pregame playing of the national anthem at NBA games as a real news story. Other websites do the same, with some linking to fake videos that redirect readers to advertisements.
