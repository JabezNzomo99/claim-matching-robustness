No, that's not true: the story was made up by a \"fauxtire\" site that creates tales about bizarre crimes and weird events for entertainment purposes. It did not happen for real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Huzlers on September 5, 2018 titled \"Florida Man Accidentally Burns Home Down After Lighting Nike Shoes On Fire In Protest Of Nike's Colin Kaepernick Ad\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nFLORIDA - A Florida man has been arrested after he reportedly accidentally burned his home down by attempting to burn a pair of Nike sneakers in protest of their latest Colom Kaepernick Ad. According to authorities, Jason Helms, 26, placed a pair of Nike sneakers in his garage and soaked them in Kerosene before lighting them on fire. The fire ended up spreading to the the garage walls and ceiling before spreading to his actual home. All in protest against Nike, who recently made an Ad featuring controversial NFL star Colin Kaepernick and reading: \"Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything... Just do it\". \"Don't burn your Nike gear\" says police officer Don Greestien, \"just send them over to me\".\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail and might have confused it for a real news article:\n\nBut the picture of the house fire has been going around since at least 2010 on stock photo and gallery websites:\n\nAnd the \"racist\" tattoo image has been going around since at least 2013:\n\nHuzlers styles itself as a \"fauxtire\" website and carries a disclaimer at the bottom of each page:\n\nAccording to Splinter News the site is run by Pablo Reyes and David Martinez and according to Buzzfeed Reyes is involved with several other fake news websites. They tend to shy away from political stories, opting instead to write for a more \"urban\" audience, with stories about rappers, criminals and celebrities.\n\nWe wrote about huzlers.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Police Did NOT Discover Over 250 Penises During Raid At Funeral Employees Home\n\u2022 Fake News: Kodak Black NOT Arrested Again Just 1 Day After Being Released From Jail On Marijuana and Illegal Firearm Charges\n\u2022 Fake News: Florida Man NOT Arrested For Hanging On Traffic Light And Sh*tting On Cars Passing Underneath\n\u2022 Fake News: Drug Dealer Did NOT Call Cops On Demi Lovato After She Ran Off Without Paying For Heroin", "lang": "en"}
