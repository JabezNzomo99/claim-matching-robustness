The photo has been circulated in a misleading context; a Brisbane-based photographer said he created the image digitally using NASA\u2019s data of the Australian bushfires.\n\nThe purported image of Australia glowing red has been shared almost 10,000 times after it was published in this Facebook post on January 5, 2020.\n\nThe caption states: \u201cA 3D image of Australia, shot from a NASA satellite.\u201d\n\nThe image has been shared extensively on social media, including here, here, here and here on Facebook, here, here and here on Twitter, as well as here, here and here on Instagram, alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe image has been shared in multiple languages, including French, Spanish, Catalan, Portuguese and Arabic.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nAt least 25 lives, more than 1,800 homes and millions of hectares of land in Australia have been lost to the deadly bushfires that erupted in September 2019, as reported by AFP here on January 7, 2020.\n\nThe photo has been shared in a misleading context; the image is a 3D virtual image created by a Brisbane-based photographer using NASA satellite data.\n\nA keyword search on Google found this January 5, 2020, Facebook post published by Anthony Hearsey, whose website states he is a photographer based in Brisbane, the capital of the Australian state of Queensland. The post has been embedded below.\n\nThe post's caption states in part: \u201cThis is a 3D visualisation of the fires in Australia. NOT A PHOTO. Think of this as prettier looking graph.\n\n\u201cThis is made from data from NASA\u2019s FIRMS (Satellite data regarding fires) between 05/12/19 - 05/01/20. These are all the areas which have been affected by bushfires.\u201d\n\nIn an email to AFP on January 6, 2020, Hearsey said he created the image on January 5 using data from NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS).\n\nAccording to NASA\u2019s website, FIRMS \u201cdistributes Near Real-Time (NRT) active fire data within three hours of satellite observation from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and NASA's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS).\u201d\n\nHearsey wrote: \u201cThe image presents past AND present fires\u2026 from the dates 05/12/19 - 05/01/20. The visual data from NASA is zoomed out, hence the density being high.\n\n\u201cThe image is basically a graph based on that information. I cannot stress enough that Australia DOES NOT look like the image I created. It\u2019s a visualisation of the areas which have been affected to date.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the image in the misleading posts (L) and the FIRMS imagery of Australia between December 5, 2019, and January 5, 2020 (R):\n\nHearsey said the virtual image he made is \u201cNOT a satellite photo\u201d, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s essentially an overlay onto a topographical view of Australia. The image was created in Cinema 4D. Essentially the topography was generated from Australian height maps. The fire overall was essentially the image from above, overlayed, and made to produce a glow.\n\n\u201dThe image was actually a self educating lesson, which I shared. (I was learning some 3D techniques) The idea was to attempt to visualise data in a more interesting way\u2026\u201d\n\nBelow is a genuine satellite imagery from NASA that shows Australia\u2019s bushfires, as well as the smoke generated from it, during the same period between December 5, 2019, and January 5, 2020:\n\nThe view of the ongoing bushfires in Australia from space has also been captured here by the International Space Station, here by Japan Meteorological Agency\u2019s Himawari 8 satellite and here by European Space Agency\u2019s Sentinel-3 satellite.\n\nThe misleading claim has also been debunked here by US fact-checking site Snopes and here by India's Vishvas News.\n\nMisinformation about the Australian bushfires crisis has circulated online as the deadly blazes continue to devastate the country\u2019s southeastern region in January 2020, as reported by AFP Fact Check here, here, here and here.", "lang": "en"}
