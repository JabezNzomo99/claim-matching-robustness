Drilon also did not walk out of the session.", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "Aug 12, 2020 3:42 PM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-73902", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/video-drilon-walking-out-senate-session-august-10", "vclaim": "The video was livestreamed on Monday, August 10, with the title and caption: \u201cNakakagulat Na Balita August 10, 2020 Sana All: Drilon supalpal biglang nagwalk-out dahil sa nakakagulat na banat ni Cynthia Villar!\u201d (Shocking news August 10, 2020: Drilon suddenly walks out because of Cynthia Villar\u2019s surprising criticism!)\n\nAs of writing, the livestream had over 281,000 views, 705 shares, and 3,300 reactions. A reader sent the video to Rappler's email for verification.\n\nThe clip in the video was from a Senate session on February 4, 2020. Facebook page Duterte News Info Live only livestreamed it on August 10 and captioned the video as such to make the events seem recent. Drilon also did not walk out of the chamber during the discussion.\n\nIn the misleading video, Drilon was seen returning to his seat after having a heated discussion with Villar on the proposed budget for the bamboo industry in Senate Bill No. 1240. In reality, however, he turned around and went back to the rostrum to again argue with Villar.\n\nThe official YouTube channel of the Philippine Senate streamed the February 4 session here. Drilon and Villar's verbal exchange started at around the 50-minute mark.\n\nAfter the exchange, the video showed Drilon back in his seat speaking to Villar who had approached him. Villar said it was just a \u201cmiscommunication.\u201d \u2013 Denise Galias/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
