(Note: That is, in the sense that man can\u2019t create rain on command. Readers pointed out to us that there is scientific evidence showing the impact of climate change on current precipitation and temperature levels.) The debate comes down to whether liberal, environmental influences in the drought-prone California left the state with not enough water conveyance systems (to move and distribute water) or reservoirs (to store water) in case of ongoing dry years. This matters because California has three main sources of water: snow in the mountains, water stored in reservoirs and water pumped from underground aquifers.\n\nThere are three main uses for water in California: environmental, urban and agricultural. Water resource experts largely agree that if all the environmental needs were ignored, there would be enough water in California for urban and agricultural uses. By allocating some of the water uses to environment, there is a shortage of water for urban and agricultural uses, they say.\n\nFiorina is correct that environmentalist groups have had an impact on California\u2019s policies and regulations that govern water usage and storage, especially in the early 1980s and onward. She notes the state\u2019s protection of endangered fish, and policies to divert usable water to protect the species. Her spokeswoman pointed out that many of the construction projects for reservoirs have been banned under the Endangered Species Act and other laws.\n\nIndeed, a series of environmental laws and regulations went into effect in the 1970s and 1980s that affected the state\u2019s water management policies. For example, the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968 and the California Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1972 protected many rivers that had been identified for dam projects. The combination of the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973 and the California Endangered Species Act of 1984 had a big role in California\u2019s water resources systems, because a variety of native fish species were listed for protection, according to \u201cManaging California\u2019s Water: From Conflict to Reconciliation.\u201d\n\nCalifornia went through an aggressive water-management construction period between the 1930s through the late 1970s. The majority of the dams, reservoirs and aqueducts that exist now were built during that time. There were some projects between 1979 and through the late 1990s, but nowhere near as many as there were during the boom during the 1960s-1970s.\n\nExperts and environmentalists agree that the influence of environmentalist groups led to the slowing down of major reservoirs and restricted areas where new projects can be built. But they reject the notion that it was the single villain. Decreased federal funding and lack of public support for large publicly funded projects also were contributors, said Jeffrey Mount, senior fellow with the Public Policy Institute in California and founding director of the University of California Davis Center for Watershed Sciences.\n\nOne key decision in 1973 by then-California Gov. Ronald Reagan (R) designated the Eel River in the California Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The law prevented construction of a major reservoir that would have flooded water supplies, according to \u201cManaging California\u2019s Water.\u201d It was one of the first projects to be blocked off through legislation. The Eel River, as well as other North Coast rivers, received federal Wild and Scenic designation under the Carter administration a decade later, further blocking any new projects. This is significant, because the North Coast has some of the last undeveloped water.\n\nFiorina said that \u201cenvironmental policies had largely contributed to this situation. It certainly is not the only cause \u2014 but their policies have blocked many of the projects that would have mitigated the current drought. Obviously not every proposed water project will be right for the state for any number of reasons. But too many have been blocked because the far left put their ideology before people\u2019s lives and livelihoods,\u201d said her spokeswoman, Sarah Isgur Flores, in an e-mail.\n\nIt is accurate that new infrastructure has not been built at levels they were before the 1980s. But that is not solely due to the influence of environmental groups or Democratic lawmakers. In fact, one landmark state legislation that established Wild and Scenic river designation in the North Coast was signed into law by then-California Gov. Ronald Reagan, who of course is a conservative icon. A combination of environmental groups, California farmers, public opinion and decreased federal funding led to the slowing down of construction in the 1980s and onward. This claim about a \u201cman-made\u201d disaster lacks important historical context, and simplifies a very complex issue.", "lang": "en"}
