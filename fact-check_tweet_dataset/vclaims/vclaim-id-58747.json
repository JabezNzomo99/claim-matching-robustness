Both are seen wearing suits and smiling.\n\nThe viral picture also has a quote superimposed on it, praising Laden, which is attributed to Trump. The quote says, \u201cI knew Osama Bin Laden. People loved him. He was a great man that died for a worthy cause.\u201d\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the image is morphed. The original picture is of Trump meeting American publisher SI Newhouse Jr at NewYork City in 1987.\n\nSeveral users have shared the viral image on Facebook. The archived version can be seen here.\n\nThe viral image looks suspicious from the word go as it was impossible for Al-Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden to meet Trump at a party, wearing a suit, leaving behind his camp in the mountains of Afghanistan.\n\nUsing reverse image search on the viral picture, we found the original image which was altered and manipulated digitally to create the fake one.\n\nWe found that the original image was posted by \u201cGetty Images\u201d in 1987 with a caption saying \u201cDonald Trump At Trump Book Parky 1987\u201d.\n\nIt was a picture of Trump and American publisher SI Newhouse who attended a book party at the Trump Tower in New York City in December 1987. This image was also used by \u201cThe Guardian\u201d.\n\nThe quote superimposed on the viral image and attributed to Trump is also as fake as the image itself. Trump never called Laden a \u201cgreat man\u201d who died \u201cfor a worthy cause\u201d.\n\nLaden, the mastermind of the World Trade Centre attack on September 11, 2001, and numerous other attacks on American personnel and establishments across the world, was killed in a US military operation at his safehouse in Pakistan a decade later.", "lang": "en"}
