Whose team are we on in the Middle East?\" Stewart said. \"So we're fighting with Iraqis to defeat ISIS along with Iran. But in Yemen we're fighting Iran with Iraqis and Saudis.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s not quite right,\" Obama laughed, \"but that\u2019s okay.\"\n\nObama went on to call Iran an anti-American, anti-Israel, anti-Semitic adversary that sponsors terrorist organizations, but he never said what wasn\u2019t quite right about the relationships that Stewart described.\n\nWe wanted to fact-check Stewart on the United States\u2019 complicated ties in the Middle East. Was Stewart right in saying that Iran was a U.S. ally against ISIS and an enemy in Yemen?\n\nU.S. and Iran against ISIS\n\nWhile both the United States and Iran are fighting against ISIS, they are not cooperating or fighting as allies. Iran is not included as part of the the United States has assembled to fight ISIS.\n\nStewart overstated the Iran-U.S. relationship, said Richard Brennan, a senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation. Even though the United States and Iran are on the same side in fighting ISIS, the nations are not allies.\n\nIran wants more influence in the area than the United States wants it to have.\n\n\"Iran has the longstanding goal of establishing itself as a prominent power in the region,\" Brennan said. Iran wants a \"weak and stable\" Iraq that will acquiesce to Iran\u2019s goals.\n\nIran\u2019s support of certain Shia militias in Iraq is also a reason that the United States has \"expressed concerns about Iran\u2019s role in Iraq,\" said Alistair Baskey, White House National Security Council spokesman.\n\nShia militias often target Iraqi Sunnis (and vice-versa) in a that dates back centuries. So even though the Shia militias are part of a broader front against ISIS, Brennan said they are still the same people responsible for killing Americans in previous conflicts.\n\nOne example is Abu Mohandis (also known as Jamal Jafaar Mohammed), the current (the sum total of all Shia militias in Iraq) who was responsible for the of the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait. He acted in the capacity of an \"Iranian agent in Iraq\" according to a 2007 .\n\nAnother reason why the United States refuses to openly support or work as an official ally of Iran: It is a of Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad. The United States opposes Assad\u2019s regime and has called for Assad to \" \" multiple times as the government brutally cracked down on its people, including the regime\u2019s on Syrian citizens dating back to 2012.\n\nNow for the other arrangement Stewart described: Is the U.S. fighting against Iran in Yemen?\n\nThe United States continues to \"provide logistical and intelligence support\" to a Saudi Arabia-led coalition of the Gulf Cooperation Council fighting the Houthi militia in Yemen, Baskey said. The coalition Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Qatar. (Oman is not a member of the coalition, although it is a member of the GCC.)\n\nThe Houthi militia forces have rallied against Yemen\u2019s president, , who took office in 2012 but was forced to resign by Houthi rebels in January 2015. (On Feb. 6, 2015, Houthi rebels Mohammed Ali al-Houthi as the president of their Revolutionary Committee).\n\nAnalysts said Iran is suspected of arming, training and equipping Houthi militia. According to a Defense News , the United States was \"monitoring\" Iranian ships that may have been delivering weapons to Houthi military. The Iranian government has officially denied helping Houthi forces, according to a .\n\nHowever, neither Iran nor the United States is doing the actual fighting in Yemen.\n\n\" \u2018We\u2019 are not fighting in Yemen \u2013 though U.S. Special Forces may be involved,\" said Theodore R. Bromund, a senior research fellow at the Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy at the Heritage Foundation. \"It is the Saudis who are doing the fighting.\"\n\nSeveral experts also pointed out that Stewart was wrong about Iraq\u2019s participation in Yemen.\n\n\"We are not aware of any Iraqi involvement in the Yemen conflict,\" Baskey confirmed.\n\nStewart said the United States is \"fighting with Iraqis to defeat ISIS along with Iran. But in Yemen we're fighting Iran with Iraqis and Saudis.\"\n\nAs Obama pointed out, Stewart's claim is off on a few points \u2014 Iran is not an official ally of the United States against ISIS even though both countries are fighting the terrorist group; the United States is not directly fighting Iran in Yemen; and Iraqi soldiers are not involved in the Yemen conflict.\n\nBut Stewart's overall perspective that the United States and Iran are in the unusual position of fighting against the same enemy in one country and working against each other in another is not too far off the mark.\n\nHis statement is partially accurate but lacking in some details. So we rate his claim Half True.", "lang": "en"}
