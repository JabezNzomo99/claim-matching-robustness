And we are just getting close to the end product only for France to twist the arm of the francophone countries and take the name of the currency we have decided to put on the common currency for ECOWAS.\u201d\n\nThe speaker again said:\n\n\u201cFrance, get your hands off Africa, get your hands off the francophone countries, stop this wickedness, it is enough. Leave Africa alone. The Eco belongs to ECOWAS, you cannot take it and twist the arm [of francophone countries]\u201d.\n\nEnglish-speaking members of Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), plus Guinea, criticized plans by the bloc\u2019s French-speaking states to change the CFA franc\u2019s name to \u2018Eco\u2019 in a statement on January 16.\n\nThe regional bloc had planned to launch a common currency under the same name in 2020.\n\nHowever, even before the announcement by ECOWAS, Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara announced that the West African CFA franc, used by the former French colonies of Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo, as well as by Guinea-Bissau, would be retired sometime in 2020 and replaced with a new currency called the Eco.\n\nGhanaFact can confirm that the voice in the clip is not that of Ghana\u2019s former President Jerry John Rawlings.\n\nA statement issued by his office has also described the clip as an \u201cimpersonation\u201d of the voice of the former Ghanaian leader and a \u201cfabrication of a faceless, mischievous and devious character.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe voice on the flyer is not former President Rawlings\u2019 and those opinions have not been voiced by the former President on any platform,\u201d the statement posted on the verified Facebook page of John Rawlings clarifies.", "lang": "en"}
