Dhalla has not been an MP since 2011.\n\nOne post from a single Facebook user attracted more than 11,000 shares in a week, focusing on the very specific issue of foreign seniors in Canada and their pension eligibility. According to the post, Liberal MP Ruby Dhalla is proposing a bill that would allow foreign seniors to collect \u201cCanada Pension\u201d after only three years of residency in Canada.\n\nThe statement is correct, but the use of the present tense is misleading. Dhalla, a Liberal MP during Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper\u2019s term, did propose such a bill to the House of Commons, but in 2009. \u201cAn Act to Amend Old Age Security requirement,\u201d or Bill C-428, aimed to lower eligibility requirements for Old Age Security (OAS), Canada\u2019s largest pension plan. If it had passed, seniors over the age of 65 would only have had to reside in Canada for three years instead of ten in order to claim OAS.\n\nBill C-428 was never passed into law. It was read once in the House of Commons, but even Dhalla\u2019s own party did not support it, leaving it dead in the water.\n\nIn 2018, seniors are still required to have spent at least 10 years in Canada after the age of 18 in order to claim a monthly pension, and 20 years if they live outside of Canada.\n\nFurthermore, Dhalla, who served as an MP from 2005 to 2011, lost to a conservative candidate in the 2011 federal election. Her former electoral district, Brampton-Springdale in Ontario, was split up in 2015 and no longer exists.\n\nThe Facebook user who posted the meme that went viral appears to be from Alberta, based on the former school and current work information on his profile. AFP contacted him and asked whether he was aware that the MP from several thousand kilometers away was no longer in office, but he did not answer by the time of publication.", "lang": "en"}
