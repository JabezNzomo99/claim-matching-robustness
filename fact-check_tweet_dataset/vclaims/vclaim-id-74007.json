They were taken during the 2011 South Korea floods.\n\nThe photos of a damaged road and the flooded Olympic Road next to the Han River were both taken for Yonhap News Agency. The image of the damaged road was taken in Wanju, south of Seoul, for Yonhap News Agency/The Associated Press on July 11, 2011. The photo of the flooded Olympic Road was shot for Yonhap News Agency on July 27, 2011.\n\nTwo photos in the Facebook post showing bodies being evacuated by rescue workers are also not recent photos. One was taken by Kim Ju-Seong for Yonhap News Agency/Reuters on July 27, 2011. Another was taken for Newsis/The Associated Press on July 27, 2011.\n\nA photo of flooded roads and cars submerged in floodwaters was taken on July 27, 2011 by Yang Hoe-Seong for Getty Images/AFP. Another was taken Lim Hun-jung for Yonhap News Agency/Reuters, according to Boston.com.\n\nThe 2020 South Korea floods have led to at least 30 deaths and forced thousands to evacuate their homes. Restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic have made rescue efforts difficult, as there are fears crowded shelters could spread the virus. \u2013 Pia Rodrigo/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
