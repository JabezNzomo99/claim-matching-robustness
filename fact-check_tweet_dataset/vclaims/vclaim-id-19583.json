Panneerselvam bowing before PM Narendra Modi. The tweet also refers to the protests that took place in Tamil Nadu over PM Modi\u2019s visit in April, 2018.\n\nMoreover, Alt News found many articles in Tamil published with the same image. One of the earliest articles published by Vikatan on September 9, 2017, carried the same photo. The article is titled, \u201c\u0b85.\u0ba4\u0bbf.\u0bae\u0bc1.\u0b95-\u0bb5\u0bc8 \u0b87\u0baf\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bbf\u0bb1\u0ba4\u0bbe \u0baa\u0bbf.\u0b9c\u0bc7.\u0baa\u0bbf ? \u0b89\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0bae\u0bc8 \u0b89\u0ba3\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd 18 \u2018\u0baa\u0bb0\u0baa\u0bb0\u2019 \u0b9a\u0bae\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bb5\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd! #Vikatan Exclusive\u201d (Does the BJP operate the AIADMK? 18 \u201cWidespread\u201d Incidents #Vikatan Exclusive -Google translated) wherein the image was posted below a subhead, \u201c\u0b9a\u0bae\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bb5\u0bae\u0bcd 11: \u0baa\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0ba9\u0bc0\u0bb0\u0bcd \u2013 \u0baa\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd!\u201d(Event 11: Paneer \u2013 Prime Minister\u2019s Meetings -Google translated). It may be noted that the veracity of the article has not been questioned.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nAlt News did a Google reverse image search and found an article published by NDTV on February 18, 2018, titled, \u201d \u2018I\u2019m Minister Because Of PM Modi\u2019s Advice,\u2019 Says O Panneerselvam.\u201d The article contained a photograph with the same background, showing PM Modi and Panneerselvam seated across each other. It was taken by the Press Information Bureau(PIB), a nodal agency of the Government of India when the two met in December 2016.\n\nSearching on Twitter with the keyword, \u201cO. Panneerselvam\u201d with a syntax, \u201cfrom:@PIB_India\u201d threw up a couple of tweets out of which one tweet had three photographs of the same event. However, none of them matched with the controversial image that has been circulated.\n\nGoogling the keywords, \u201cO.Panneerselvam bow\u201d shows images of O. Panneerselvam greeting Former Tamil Nadu CM Jayalalithaa. According to the Press Trust of India\u2018s photo archive, it was captioned, \u201cFormer Chief Minister O Panneerselvam bows in front of AIADMK Leader J Jayalalithaa after she took an oath as new chief minister of Tamil Nadu in Chennai on Saturday.\u201d Alt News found that the image of Panneerselvam seen kowtowing to PM Modi dates back to 2016 and has been lifted from the photograph posted below.\n\nPhotoshopped images have become an easy tool for political propaganda. It does not take much time or effort to crop two unrelated images and put them together to churn a false narrative. Social media users are advised to be circumspect with regard to controversial content and are encouraged to use tools like reverse image search in order to find out the truth.", "lang": "en"}
