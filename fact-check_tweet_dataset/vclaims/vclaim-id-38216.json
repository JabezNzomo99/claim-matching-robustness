Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Photo of a Delhipoliceman throwing stones along with rioters in Delhi. Fact: The photo was taken on 19 December 2019 in Lucknow. It shows Uttar Pradesh Police, not Delhi Police. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the photo was run through the Google Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found on the \u2018Getty Images\u2019 website. On the website, the photo has the following description: \u2018Police throw stones towards protesters during demonstrations against India\u2019s new citizenship law in Lucknow on December 19, 2019\u2019. Also, the posted photo is a cropped photo. In the full version, the address of the shop in the background suggests that the photo was taken in Lucknow. So, the photo is not related to recent riots in Delhi.\n\nTo sum it up, an old photo of UP Police shared as \u2018Delhi Police throwing stones along with rioters\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
