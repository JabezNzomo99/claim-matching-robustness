Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nFact: While it is true that a sadhu was killed in Nanded, the accused is not a Muslim.

The Police have denied any communal angle and have clarified that the accused (Sainath Langote \u2013 a local villager and follower of the sadhu) and sadhu are from the same community, and prima facie the incident looks like an attempted robbery. The accused was also booked previously in other crimes.\n\nThe English translation (translated by Google) of FIR filed on the incident can be read below:\n\nTo sum it up, the murder of a sadhu in Nanded is being falsely shared with a communal narrative.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
