Picking the middle of the top and bottom estimate, that\u2019s UK GDP 7.5% smaller than it would have been.\n\nAs a consequence of lower GDP, it estimated that after 15 years the government would collect between \u00a338 billion and \u00a366 billion less tax revenue than it would have done, so \u00a352 billion on average.", "lang": "en"}
