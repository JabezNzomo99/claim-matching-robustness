In his book \u201cThe Critique of Practical Reason,\u201d Kant wrote, \u201cTwo things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the more oftener and more steadily we reflect on them: the starry heavens above and the moral law within.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller also searched an archive of approximately 80,000 original documents related to Einstein but turned up no results for the expression.", "lang": "en"}
