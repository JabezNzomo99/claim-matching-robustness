Tom Price of Georgia has some specific concerns about President Barack Obama\u2019s proposed budget.\n\nA post on the Roswell Republican\u2019s Twitter page summarized his objections.\n\n\"POTUS\u2019 budget adds 2 new tax increases to IRA & 401(k) savers. A total tax increase of $14billion. #ObamaTaxHike,\" it read.\n\nPOTUS is an acronym for president of the United States.\n\nA PolitiFact Georgia Twitter follower was skeptical about whether Price had his facts right and asked us to investigate.\n\nPrice spokesman Ryan Murphy explained the congressman\u2019s claim. Price was referring to two changes in the proposed budget. The first would require some beneficiaries of individual retirement accounts to take their inherited distributions over a five-year stretch. The second change would limit the accrual of tax-favored retirement plans. It would cap how much money people could accumulate in tax-deferred retirement accounts at $3.4 million.\n\n\"The total revenue impact comes to $14.253 billion over ten years,\" Murphy said via email.\n\nA White House report Murphy forwarded us detailed Murphy\u2019s claim. The report includes both proposed changes that Murphy mentioned. It also contains a table that says changing the rules for beneficiaries would bring in an additional $4.9 billion in revenue to the federal government over 10 years. By creating the cap, the chart shows the federal government would pocket an additional $9.3 billion over 10 years. Together, it\u2019s slightly more than $14 billion, as Murphy said.\n\nThe White House communications department asked us to send our questions in writing. We did so twice and did not get a response.\n\nGrover Norquist, the outspoken leader of Americans for Tax Reform, wrote about these proposed changes in a list of the top 10 tax increases in Obama\u2019s budget.\n\nSome experts say the percentage of Americans who would be affected by these changes is small. Less than 1 percent of IRA and 401(k) account holders have more than $3 million in their portfolios, one study shows.\n\nEric Toder, an expert at the Tax Policy Center in Washington, agreed these changes would affect a small number of Americans. Toder said by limiting the beneficiary withdrawals to just five years, \"you are going to be paying more taxes.\" Tax experts say the five-year requirement makes recipients withdraw a larger sum of money, but it could also put that person into a higher tax bracket and make him pay more in income taxes.\n\nCurrently, there\u2019s no limit on how much you can accumulate in a retirement account. If approved, investors would have to put more money in taxable accounts once they exceed the limit, Forbes.com says.\n\nToder said there\u2019s been some discussion on Capitol Hill about limiting the accrual, but he doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s much interest in Congress to make either one of these changes.\n\nStill, is it accurate to label these as tax increases since they\u2019re not typical changes in a tax rate? Toder compared it to changing the mortgage interest deduction on income taxes, an idea that was discussed during last year\u2019s presidential race. For homeowners, he said, such a change would be a tax increase.\n\n\"Technically, they are tax increases,\" he said of the proposed changes.\n\nWilliam McBride, the chief economist at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation in Washington, agreed with Price\u2019s assessment.\n\n\"Yes, these count as increases,\" McBride said via email.\n\nTo sum up, Price claimed on Twitter that the president\u2019s budget includes two new tax increases that would total $14 billion. The changes could add that much money to Uncle Sam\u2019s coffers over a 10-year period.\n\nCalling them tax increases is a matter of semantics. That could imply it would affect large numbers of people who got Price\u2019s tweet. The changes would affect a very small percentage of account holders, studies show. That\u2019s important context that is missing.", "lang": "en"}
