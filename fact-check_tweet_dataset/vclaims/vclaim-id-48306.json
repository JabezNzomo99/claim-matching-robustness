A Kohl\u2019s spokesperson confirmed that the account has no affiliation with the retailer.\n\nAmid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, retailers across the country have adjusted their operations to accommodate public health guidelines, ensure the safety of their employees and customers, and maintain revenue streams, Forbes reported.\n\nThe post, which has been shared over 6,700 times, masquerades as a recent promotion from Kohl\u2019s, saying, \u201cTo help our loyal Customers \u2013 We are going to select 80 Lucky families who can shop as much as they could for up to 1 hour and we will cover all the costs.\u201d It requires social media users to like the page, share the post and comment \u201cThanks\u201d to enter the giveaway.\n\nCloser inspection of the Facebook page reveals that it is not actually from Kohl\u2019s, however. It has the wrong name \u2013 Kohl\u2019s Club rather than Kohl\u2019s \u2013 and lacks a blue checkmark, which notes that the account has been verified by Facebook.

Kohl\u2019s announced on March 30 that it will extend its nationwide store closures until \u201cfurther notice.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first fake shopping spree offer that has circulated online this month. The Facebook page Kroger Club, which has since been taken down, posted a fake promotion that matches the Kohl\u2019s Club shopping spree giveaway nearly word-for-word.", "lang": "en"}
