In terms of just individual tax cuts in the Trump tax law \u2014 which we should consider given that Biden was addressing union workers and other campaign supporters \u2014 the Tax Policy Center found 65 percent of taxpayers would get tax cuts. In the $50,000 to $75,000 range, 82 percent would get tax cuts, with people who got a tax cut ending up with an average of almost $1,000. The Biden campaign tried to argue that he was talking about the impact of the law in 2027, when the individual tax cuts in the law will have expired. But Biden spoke in the present tense.\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics data shows that nearly 8 million people hold more than one job. But most of those extra jobs are part time, not full time. And the \u201cmillions\u201d of people amount to just 5 percent of Americans with jobs. So that means 95 percent of workers are not working two or three jobs \u201cjust to survive,\u201d making this a misleading statement. (Since there was some Twitter outrage about this assessment, please note that this is a summary of a previous fact check, in which we said Sanders had the \u201cmost accurate sound bite\u201d on this issue among Democrats running for president. The full version can be found here.)\n\nEmployers cover about 57 percent of that $28,000. So to an average family of four, the cost of health care appears to be $12,000. (Basic economics says the employer contribution is part of the overall paycheck, but most people don\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d that money.) If Sanders wants most families to feel as if they\u2019re saving money, any tax increase from Medicare-for-all would have to be less than the visible cost of health care \u2014 that is, $12,000.\n\nThis statistic is courtesy of a Federal Reserve report on the \u201cEconomic Well-Being of U.S. Households.\u201d But the report noted the ratio is an improvement from 2013, when half of the adults said they were \u201cill-prepared for such an expense.\u201d In 2017, 59 percent said they could cover the expense, a significant increase, and the number grew to 61 percent in 2018. With the continued growth of the economy, the figure is probably even higher in 2019.\n\nFor Iraq, O\u2019Rourke is counting from 1991, when the United States and its allies ejected the Iraqis from Kuwait. In doing so, he is counting the years 1991 through 2003, when the United States and its partners imposed no-fly zones in the northern and southern parts of Iraq but did not have forces on the ground. A spokesman said O\u2019Rourke\u2019s remarks were inspired by Gen. Stephen W. Wilson, the Air Force\u2019s vice chief of staff, who came before the House Armed Services Committee on Oct. 3, 2017, and stated: \u201cThe 26 years of continuous combat has limited our ability to prepare . . . against advanced future threats.\" But Wilson\u2019s remarks were not made in the context of Iraq, and they were only about the Air Force.", "lang": "en"}
