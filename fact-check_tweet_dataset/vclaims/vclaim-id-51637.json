In the 30-seconds video, a man dressed in a thawb (a long tunic-like garment) and wearing a keffiyeh (scarf) on his head can be seen closely followed by a robot and several others.\n\nThe caption along with one such video uploaded on Twitter by a verified user Roshan Abeysinghe reads, \u201cKing of Bahrain arrives in Dubai with his robot bodyguard fitted 360 with cameras and inbuilt pistols. Technology moving very fast than ever in history. Now politicians might order this too.\u201d\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim is misleading. The man in the video is not the King of Bahrain and the robot is not his bodyguard.\n\nOfficial Facebook page of DY365, an Assamese news channel also shared the same video with the misleading claim.\n\nThe archived versions of the posts can be seen here, here, and here.\n\nWith the help of the InVID tool, we reverse-searched one of the keyframes of the video and found news reports by Gulf News and Khaleej Times about the robot in the viral video.\n\nAccording to a Gulf News report published on February 18, 2019, the eight feet tall, 60 kg robot was a greeter at Abu Dhabi\u2019s International Defence Exhibition, Idex 2019.\n\nThe report further says the multilingual robot that walks in a military vest is named Titan and it is the world's first commercial entertainment robot artist developed by the British company Cyberstein.\n\nThe Khaleej Times quoted Titan as saying, \u201cPeace and blessings be with you. How are you all visitors? The best thing to happen to me at Idex this year is being hired by the Safe City Group. Yay!\"\n\nHowever, we couldn\u2019t find any report from credible sources that said the robot is fitted with 360-degree cameras and pistols as claimed by many netizens.\n\nWe also found a longer version of the video in question uploaded on February 24, 2019, on a YouTube channel DUBAI7 with the title \u201c8-ft Titan robot greets visitors at UAE defense show Idex in Abu Dhabi\u201d.\n\nIn the 3 minutes 28-second video, the robot can be seen walking around and greeting guests.\n\nAlso, a closer look at the video shows the UAE national flag on the arm and shoulder of the robot.\n\nAccording to some other reports, it was Chief of Staff of the Bahrain Defence Force (BDF), Lieutenant-General Dheyab bin Saqr Al-Nuaimi who visited UAE\u2019s Idex 2020 and not King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa.\n\nHence the viral video is not of King of Bahrain walking with his robot bodyguard. The video shows Titan, a commercial entertainment robot at Abu Dhabi\u2019s International Defence Exhibition, Idex 2019.", "lang": "en"}
