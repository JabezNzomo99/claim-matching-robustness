He argued that, given \u00a31 trillion was spent on bailing out the banks after the financial crisis, why not do the same for farmers and fishermen now?\n\nBut the \u00a31 trillion figure is incorrect: nowhere near that much was actually spent on bank bailouts during the financial crisis.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2009, the Labour government made a number of interventions to bail out banks that were on the brink of collapse and support the banking sector.\n\nOverall, the government spent \u00a3137 billion of public money to provide loans and capital to stabilise the banks, according to the latest figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in March 2019.\n\nHowever, most of that money has been recouped in the years since\u2014mainly through repayments and other schemes.\n\nAs of March 2019, the OBR estimates that the net cost of the bank bailouts\u2014once you factor in money recouped by the government\u2014was \u00a327 billion.\n\nSeparate figures from the National Audit Office (NAO) in 2018 estimated the sum spent to stabilise the banks to be \u00a3133 billion.\n\nThe NAO also provides a second figure, which brings us back to Mr Hunt\u2019s claim. The Treasury also provided a number of financial guarantees during the crisis, which totalled around \u00a31 trillion, according to the NAO. This is money the government promised to pay to investors or compensate them with if they lost their money, and is presumably the sum Mr Hunt is referring to.\n\nBut it\u2019s not correct to say that this sum was all spent on bailing out the banks. As the House of Commons Library points out, financial guarantees cost nothing if all goes well. Their main purpose is to restore confidence in banking sector.\n\nSpeaking yesterday on BBC Radio 4, Paul Johnson, Director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies said \u201cit\u2019s simply not true that in any real sense we spent a trillion pounds bailing out the banks.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
