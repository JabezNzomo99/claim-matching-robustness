Although Epstein committed suicide in his jail cell several weeks later, rumors and accusations continue to fly about which high-profile persons who were friendly with Epstein may have known about, or even participated in, illegal sexual activities with minors taking place at Epstein\u2019s so-called \u201cPedophile Island in the U.S. Virgin Islands (and elsewhere).\n\nOne prominent celebrity who often socialized with Epstein beginning in the latter part of the 1980s was Donald Trump, who by the time of Epstein\u2019s 2019 arrest had become President of the United States. Although Trump and Epstein apparently had long since ceased to remain on speaking terms by 2019, Trump\u2019s name continued to be connected with Epstein\u2019s illegal activities throughout the 2016 presidential campaign and beyond, due in large part to a lawsuit initially filed against Trump and Epstein in April 2016 by a woman who claimed that Trump had repeatedly raped her at several Upper East Side parties hosted by Epstein in 1994, when she was just 13 years old. (The first filing of the lawsuit was dismissed by the court; the second was voluntarily withdrawn by the plaintiff because, she claimed, her life had been threatened.)\n\nIn mid-2020, a meme circulated via social media sought to defend Trump against such accusations by offering positive information about him, including claims that Trump had booted Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago club for inappropriate behavior towards a teenager, had \u201couted Epstein as a pedophile\u201d early on, and had voluntarily provided information to help Epstein\u2019s victims build a case against the financier:\n\nThis meme offers a mixed bag of factual and inaccurate or misleading information, as detailed below:\n\nThe first part of the text, about Trump\u2019s defying a Palm Beach ordinance and refusing to exclude Black people and Jews from his club Mar-a-Lago, has a kernel of truth to it, but the wording used is a bit misleading. It wasn\u2019t the case, as the meme implies, that a local law required Trump to exclude \u201cBlacks and Jews\u201d from his club, but he refused to follow that law and \u201csued\u201d to have it abolished. Rather (as we detailed in an earlier article), when Trump sought to convert Mar-a-Lago (which he had purchased in 1985) from a private estate to a club in the 1990s, he was disgruntled that the town council imposed a series of operational restrictions upon his plans that were more stringent than the restrictions placed on upon existing (segregated) clubs and vehemently criticized local officials over the matter. Trump was eventually successful in getting most of those restrictions overturned:\n\nThe town council, seeing Trump as an ostentatious outsider, handed him a list of restrictions as he sought to transform the property in the 1990s. Membership, traffic, party attendance, even photography \u2014 all would be strictly limited. But Trump undercut his adversaries with a searing attack, claiming that local officials seemed to accept the established private clubs in town that had excluded Jews and blacks while imposing tough rules on his inclusive one. Trump\u2019s lawyer sent every member of the town council copies of two classic movies about discrimination: A Gentleman\u2019s Agreement, about a journalist who pretends to be Jewish to expose anti-Semitism, and Guess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner, about a white couple\u2019s reaction to their daughter bringing home a black fiance. The move infuriated council members, who said it was a distraction from their concerns that Trump\u2019s club would spoil a quiet street. But, in time, Trump got most of the restrictions lifted. \u201cHe won in the court of public opinion,\u201d said Jack McDonald, who was a council member at the time and who went on to be mayor and to join Mar-a-Lago.\n\nIn 2002, Trump described Epstein as a \u201cterrific guy and said he had known Epstein \u201cfor 15 years,\u201d which would date their friendship as beginning around 1987. In 2019, after Epstein\u2019s arrest on federal sex trafficking charges, Trump declared that he \u201cwas not a fan\u201d of Epstein and asserted, \u201cI had a falling out with him a long time ago, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve spoken to him for 15 years,\u201d which would date their friendship as ending around 2004.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t publicly state what prompted his falling-out with Epstein, but the 2020 book \u201cThe Grifter\u2019s Club\u201d attributed it (via a second-hand source) to Trump\u2019s kicking Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club after Epstein allegedly harassed another club member\u2019s teenage daughter:\n\nDonald Trump severed ties with Jeffrey Epstein after the disgraced financier hit on the teenage daughter of a Mar-a-Lago member, threatening the Trump brand of glitz and glamour, according to a new book published about the president\u2019s Palm Beach club. [A] new book titled \u201cThe Grifter\u2019s Club\u201d says the late sex trafficker was indeed a member [of Mar-a-Lago] and that the two stopped talking \u2014 and Epstein was kicked off the rolls and banned from Mar-a-Lago \u2014 following the incident with a club member\u2019s teen daughter. Another club member explained that Trump \u201ckicked Epstein out after Epstein harassed the daughter of a member. The way this person described it, such an act could irreparably harm the Trump brand, leaving Donald no choice but to remove Epstein,\u201d said Sarah Blaskey, a Miami Herald investigative reporter who co-wrote the book with Miami Herald journalists Nicholas Nehamas and Jay Weaver and Caitlin Ostroff of the Wall Street Journal. \u201cThe Trump Organization did not respond to our requests for comment on this or other matters.\u201d\n\nA July 2019 New York Times article provided a slightly different story, however, quoting a former Trump campaign aide as saying that Trump had banned Epstein from his club because Epstein \u201chad tried to recruit a woman who worked\u201d there:\n\nWe found nothing suggesting that Trump had \u201couted Epstein as a pedophile\u201d in 2002, however. Their friendship apparently didn\u2019t end until after that, and an October 2002 New York magazine profile of Epstein quoted Trump as still speaking quite positively of the financier at that time:\n\nThe reference to Trump\u2019s being the only one of Epstein\u2019s contacts who was not subpoenaed in 2005 because he came forward voluntarily appears to be a garbled version of an occurrence from 2009, when Trump was in fact served with a subpoena but rendered it unnecessary by proactively coming forward to volunteer information:\n\nThe July 2020 arrest and indictment of long-time Epstein associate and girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell on charges of enticement of minors and sex trafficking of children has kept Epstein\u2019s illicit sexual activities in the forefront of the news even beyond his death.", "lang": "en"}
