It has since been deleted.\n\nHe also said in 2011 that \"I believe that the NHS is a monolithic hangover from days gone by... quite frankly I would like to see more free market introduced into the health service\u201d.\n\nWhen this clip was played to him on Sky News recently, Mr Nuttall responded as follows:\n\n\u201cWhat I have said about the NHS is simply this: I believe it needs to be streamlined. It cannot be right that 51% of people who work in the NHS in England are not clinically qualified, it\u2019s too big, it\u2019s cumbersome. What I do believe we could have more free market in is in places like procurement whereby the NHS itself is paying sometimes ten to thirty times over the odds for drugs. If you brought in a private company you could hire and fire them on results that they got for the British public.\u201d\n\nHis deputy, Mr Whittle, pointed out that NHS privatisation has never been official party policy. The party\u2019s 2015 election manifesto called the NHS a \u201ccherished institution\u201d, and addressed \u201cgrowing concern\u201d that a EU-US trade deal being negotiated would mean \u201cprivatising significant parts of our NHS\u201d.\n\nThe party\u2019s health policy for that election began with \u201ckeep the NHS free at the point of delivery\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to still have that and have private sector involvement in the NHS. It just depends what we mean by \u201cNHS privatisation\u201d. Private firms can already bid to do work on behalf of the NHS. In that sense, a portion of the service is already \u201cprivatised\u201d.\n\n\"Privatisation\" could also mean moving away from the existing system to a health insurance model, as former UKIP leader Nigel Farage once advocated.", "lang": "en"}
