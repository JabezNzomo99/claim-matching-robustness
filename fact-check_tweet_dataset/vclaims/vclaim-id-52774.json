The viral video invoked the public outrage on the alleged inconsiderate handling of the dead bodies by the Bengal government.\n\nThe caption suggests that the bodies of COVID-19 patients were bought at Garia, Kolkata crematorium ground but the local people protested fearing the spread of infections, thus these bodies were being taken somewhere else.\n\nHere\u2019s the link to the archived post.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above video and found the claim to be misleading.\n\nThe West Bengal Health department and Kolkata Police department had clarified that these were mere rumors and the dead bodies being dragged were of unclaimed, unidentified bodies and not of COVID-19 patients.\n\nAn article by Times Now, dated June 11, 2020, mentions a letter written by NRS Medical College Principal to the Kolkata Police Commissioner. In the letter, he had mentioned the viral video showing the bodies being disposed of is from NRS medical morgue and none of these dead bodies were of COVID patients. The principal has asked the commissioner to take necessary actions against the video.\n\nClarifying the same, Kolkata Police Department posted an official tweet saying, \u201cWest Bengal Health Department has informed that dead bodies were not of COVID patients, but were unclaimed/ unidentified bodies from Hospital Morgue. Legal action is being taken against persons spreading.\u201d\n\nHowever, the emergence of the video sparked controversy over the manner in which the bodies were being loaded.\n\nWest Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankar criticized the Govt over the video and sought a report on the issue from the home secretary of the state. He tweeted, \u201cAnguished! Share public outrage and deep concern at most unconscionable heart-rendering callous dragging of dead bodies reflected in videos. Shocked at state of affairs @ Have sought urgent briefing today from KMC Chairperson and Municipal Commissioner.\u201d\n\nIn another tweet, posted two hours late, he said, \u201cResponse from Home Secretary has come. Virtual admission about callous handling of dead bodies promising procedure will be streamlined. Rather than booking those responsible for such inhuman criminality, police is being misused to \u2018teach a lesson\u2019 to those who exposed it.\u201d\n\nEven though the matter has now taken a political turn, the above information establishes that the bodies in the video were not of COVID-19 patients.\n\nBased on our investigation, we can conclude that these claims are misleading.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
