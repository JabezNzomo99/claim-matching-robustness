The claim is false; the photos actually show highways in Kosovo and Japan.\n\nThe photos were shared in this Facebook post on August 19, 2020.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption states: \"Wow! This is it! No more heavy traffic. / Expresway (sic) from Naga City Cebu to Danao City\".\n\nNaga and Danao are cities in the central Philippine province of Cebu. Authorities plan to build an expressway between the two cities.\n\nThe same photos were also shared here, here and here on Facebook and here on Twitter, alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim, however, is false.\n\nA reverse image search on Google and subsequent keyword searches found three of the photos were published in June 2019 Facebook posts here and here. They were published by a page called \u201cExplore Kosovo - with Bujar Gashi\u201d.\n\nIn response to the misleading posts, a spokesperson for the Explore Kosovo Facebook page told AFP the photos show Kosovo.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in Kosovo, heading to Macedonia,\u201d the spokesperson said in a Facebook message on August 25, 2020.\n\nThe three photos published by the \u201cExplore Kosovo - with Bujar Gashi\u201d page all bear the watermark; \u201cBujar Gashi\u201d.\n\nA similar set of photos showing the same highway were also published in this 2019 report by an Albanian-language media site based in Switzerland. The images are also credited to Bujar Gashi.\n\nThe report\u2019s headline translates to English as: \u201cPhoto news: \"Arb\u00ebn Xhaferi\" Highway, tourist attraction of Kosovo\u201d.\n\nThe report translates to English, in part, as: \u201cWell-known photographer, Bujar Gashi brings us rare images from the newest highway in Kosovo, 'Arb\u00ebn Xhaferi'.\n\n\u201cThe Highway Bridge enables visitors to see the Ka\u00e7anik Gorge and the natural beauties of the surrounding areas.\u201d\n\nBelow is a set of screenshot comparisons, showing the photos in the misleading posts (L) and the \u201cExplore Kosovo - with Bujar Gashi\u201d posts (R):\n\nThe location corresponds with satellite imagery on Google Maps of Arb\u00ebn Xhaferi highway where it passes through the Kacanik Gorge.\n\nA reverse image search on TinEye found the fourth photo in the album is a mirrored version of this public domain photo, uploaded to Wikimedia Commons in September 2012.\n\nThe photo\u2019s description states it shows the \u201cShin-Tomei Expressway\u201d in Japan.\n\nThe photo also corresponds to stock photos published here and here, both captioned with the same location. The mountain in the photo\u2019s background can also be seen in this Google Street View of a portion of the Shin-Tomei Expressway.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the fourth photo in the misleading post (L) and the Wikimedia Commons photo (R):", "lang": "en"}
