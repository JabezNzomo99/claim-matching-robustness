From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it\u2019s going to be only America first, America first. Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.\n\nIn addition to figuring prominently in his speeches, \u201cAmerica first\u201d has turned up regularly in Trump\u2019s tweets, often paired with his other favorite rallying cry, \u201cMake America great again\u201d:\n\nAs Trump\u2019s critics have accurately observed, the president did not invent the phrase \u201cAmerica First,\u201d nor was he the first public figure to sloganize it. More to the point, they say, many of the social and political contexts in which it has been used in the past were unsavory.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League noted in an April 2016 statement urging Trump to reconsider his use of it that \u201cAmerica First\u201d was associated before and during World War II with an isolationist political organization some of whose members openly displayed pro-Nazi and anti-Semitic tendencies:\n\nThe most noteworthy leader of the \u201cAmerica First Committee\u201d was Charles Lindbergh, who sympathized with the Nazis and whose rhetoric was characterized by anti-Semitism and offensive stereotypes, including assertions that Jews posed a threat to the U.S. because of their influence in motion pictures, radio, the press, and the government. \u201cThe undercurrents of anti-Semitism and bigotry that characterized the America First movement \u2014 including the assumption that Jews who opposed the movement had their own agenda and were not acting in America\u2019s best interest \u2014 is fortunately not a major concern today,\u201d said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO. \u201cHowever, for many Americans, the term \u2018America First\u2019 will always be associated with and tainted by this history. In a political season that already has prompted a national conversation about civility and tolerance, choosing a call to action historically associated with incivility and intolerance seems ill-advised.\u201d\n\nOther Trump critics identify the slogan with the infamous white supremacist hate group the Ku Klux Klan, one of whose ex-leaders, David Duke, himself ran for public office in 2016 on an \u201cAmerica first\u201d platform. Social media memes critical of Trump\u2019s enthusiasm for the slogan use archival images and Klan memorabilia to make the point that its history is anything but innocuous:\n\nThe images above are authentic. The photo of KKK members marching with an \u201cAmerica first\u201d banner dates from the 1920s and can be found in the Getty Images archive. The Ku Klux Klan \u201ccoin\u201d (actually a token) bearing the slogans \u201cAmerica First\u201d and \u201cPreserve Racial Purity\u201d on one face and \u201cThe Invisible Empire\u201d on the other was struck in 1965 to celebrate the centennial of the KKK\u2019s founding, numismatists say, although it was never officially endorsed by the organization.\n\nThe phrase \u201cAmerica first\u201d also appears in Klan literature as part of a longer credo, \u201cAmerica first, last and forever,\u201d or its variant \u201cAmerica first, last and always,\u201d as uttered by a KKK speaker quoted in the Binghamton, New York Press and Sun-Bulletin in 1923:\n\nAnother variant is enshrined in an \u201cImperial Proclamation\u201d submitted as evidence during a Congressional hearing on the Klan\u2019s activities in 1921:\n\nDespite their embrace of the slogan, however, there is no evidence that the Ku Klux Klan invented it, as has sometimes been alleged. There are instances of its use by politicians predating any examples we\u2019ve found directly attributable to the Klan.\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson ran for re-election on an \u201cAmerica first\u201d platform in 1916, for example, in that instance using the phrase to remind voters that his isolationist stance had kept U.S. troops out of the burgeoning conflict in Europe (never mind that he abandoned that position and sent them to fight in World War I during his second term). A popular song called \u201cAmerica First!\u201d was dedicated to Wilson and published in 1917.\n\nFor that matter, Presidents Calvin Coolidge, Warren G. Harding, and William McKinley all used the catchphrase at one time or another to promote isolationist and/or protectionist foreign policies (we found an instance of McKinley being touted as having an \u201cAmerica first\u201d agenda as long ago as 1896).\n\nIn sum, the political slogan \u201cAmerica First\u201d has a pedigree stretching back more than a hundred years, with connotations ranging from anti-expansionism and trade protectionism to outright racism and anti-Semitism. Although it has been trumpeted over time by hate groups such as the Ku Klux Klan, its use does not automatically confer the most heinous of those attitudes on the user \u2014 although given its less savory associations, one wonders why any informed person would embrace it today.", "lang": "en"}
