(\u201cUnclear\u201d in an earlier version of this fact check.) The DUP claim that \u201cCity Deals are part of our Confidence and Supply Agreement\u201d is not explicitly referenced in the text of the Confidence and Supply Agreement they made with the Conservative Party, nor referenced by the Chancellor Philip Hammond in delivering his \u201cFinancial Statement\u201d (29/10/2018). But as part of discussions between the Conservative Party and the DUP, the UK Government committed itself to working with the Northern Ireland Executive and other stakeholders towards city deals in Northern Ireland. The Belfast Regional City Deal was negotiated and agreed among Belfast City Council, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and the UK Government.\n\nThe DUP claimed \u201cCity Deals are part of our Confidence and Supply Agreement\u201d in the following tweet posted by the party on 30/10/2018:\n\nThis claim also includes the line \u201c\u00a3350m for City Deals, for everyone\u201d. The tweet states that the Belfast City Deal has been agreed and formal negotiations have opened for Londonderry and Strabane Regions City deal.\n\nWhat is the Confidence and Supply Agreement?\n\nIn June 2017, Theresa May called a general election. The Conservatives won 318 seats, four short of the number a prime minister needs to form a Government with an absolute majority. This was problematic for Theresa May as it would have left her Government in a vulnerable position in relation to Brexit votes during the UK-EU negotiations. She looked to the DUP and its 10 MPs to help give her a working majority of 328, in what was termed a \u201cConfidence and Supply Agreement\u201d. The Agreement is three pages long, and the relevant \u201cPolicy Agreement\u201d section outlines the following areas of consideration as part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement:\n\u2022 Both parties have agreed that there will be no change to the Pensions Triple Lock and the universal nature of the Winter Fuel Payment.\n\u2022 The parties agree to meet the NATO commitment of spending 2% of GDP on the armed forces. Both parties are committed to the Armed Forces Covenant and to its implementation throughout the United Kingdom\n\u2022 Both parties agree to work together to consider options to support the highly successful reserve forces in Northern Ireland.\n\u2022 The parties recognise the importance of the agriculture sector to Northern Ireland and the opportunities for growth that exist. Agriculture will be a critical policy area during the EU exit negotiations.\n\u2022 The parties agree to continue to commit the same cash total in funds for farm support until the end of the Parliament. Further discussion will take place on the future framework for farming support.\n\nThere is no explicit reference to the Belfast City Deal (or wider City Deals) as part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.\n\nIn addition to the Confidence and Supply Agreement, the DUP negotiated a pledge of Financial Support for Northern Ireland, covering economy and infrastructure, health and education, flexibility in the disbursement of funding previously allocated to shared education and housing, and a commitment to implement the legacy bodies agreed at the Stormont House Agreement.\n\nThe economy and infrastructure section of the financial support document includes the statement:\n\n\u201cThe UK government is committed to working with the [Northern Ireland] Executive and other stakeholders to work towards a comprehensive and ambitious set of city deals across Northern Ireland to boost investment and help unlock the full potential of Northern Ireland.\u201d\n\nWhat is the Belfast City Deal?\n\nCity Deals are described by the UK Government as:\n\n\u201c\u2026[a]n agreement between government and a city. It gives the city and its surrounding area certain powers and freedom to:\n\u2022 take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area\n\u2022 do what they think is best to help businesses grow\n\u2022 decide how public money should be spent\u201d\n\nThe first two \u201cwaves\u201d of city deals were delivered as part of the 2010 to 2015 Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government.\n\nFurther city deals were agreed for Glasgow and Clyde Valley (4/7/2014) and Aberdeen (28/1/2016), as examples of the UK government, Scottish government, and local authorities working together in economic investment.\n\nOn 22 November 2017 the Chancellor, Philip Hammond announced (Column 1052) that the Government \u201cwill open negotiations for a Belfast city deal as part of our commitment to a comprehensive and ambitious set of city deals across Northern Ireland\u201d.\n\nIn the absence of a Northern Ireland Executive, negotiations for the Belfast Regional City Deal involved the UK Government, the Northern Ireland Civil Service, and Belfast City Council.\n\nBelfast City Council submitted its negotiating position (proposal; summary) to the Northern Ireland Secretary of State and Westminster on 28 September 2018, and it held a partner reception at Westminster on 24 October 2018.\n\nThroughout, DUP MPs have campaigned for a city deal for Belfast, including Gavin Robinson MP (2016; 2017) and Nigel Dodds MP (2018).\n\nThe Belfast Regional City Deal focuses on four key investment pillars: digital and innovation; infrastructure; tourism-led regeneration; and skills and employability. The proposals asked the UK government for \u00a3450 million in the impending budget as part of the deal.\n\nPhilip Hammond, in delivering his budget in the House of Commons on 29 October 2018, stated that \u00a3350m would be allocated to the Belfast City Deal:\n\n\u201cI can also announce funding for further city and growth deals, including \u00a3150 million for Tay Cities, \u00a3350 million for Belfast and \u00a3120 million for North \u200bWales, while negotiations progress with Ayrshire, Mid Wales and Borderlands, and will begin with Moray, Derry/Londonderry and Strabane as well.\u201d\n\nThe \u00a3350m was \u00a3100m less than the \u00a3450m requested in Belfast City Council\u2019s proposal to the Secretary of State in early October 2018.\n\nThe \u201cCity Deals\u201d policy began in the previous Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government (2010-2015). It has extended into Scotland (in conjunction with the Scottish Government and local authorities in Scotland) and Northern Ireland (in conjunction with the Northern Ireland Executive and local councils in Northern Ireland). The UK Government\u2019s support for city deals in Northern Ireland is not explicit in the \u201cConfidence and Supply Agreement\u201d between the Conservative Party and the Democratic Unionist Party, but is named in a subsequent financial support package agreed by the two parties. Whether the lack of UK Government support for a Northern Ireland city deal would be deemed a breach of the Confidence and Supply Agreement is open to debate. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland represented the Northern Ireland Executive, in its absence, during the negotiations for the Belfast Regional City Deal, which was announced by the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer on 29 October 2018.\n\nA previous version of this article did not include the UK Government policy paper, \u201cUK Government Financial Support for Northern Ireland\u201d, as an outcome of Conservative Party discussions with the DUP.
