The image is being used in a misleading context; it was actually taken in 2006 by the Associated Press news agency and shows a Kashmiri activist at a demonstration in Indian-administered Kashmir.\n\nThe photo was shared in this Facebook post on April 25, 2019, by a page with more than 22,000 followers. It has been shared nearly 1,000 times.\n\nThe text on the image states: \"Won\u2019t stand for Anzac Day, will stand for a welfare payment. Freedom of speech productions Australian right wing memes and news\".\n\nAnzac Day is an annual commemoration on April 25 for those who have served in the armed forces of Australia and New Zealand. Here is an AFP report about the 2019 event.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post's caption contains a series of hashtags: \"#FreedomOfSpeechProductions #FreedomOfSpeechProductionsUSA #KimVugaLoveAustraliaorLeaveParty #AussieStuffForAussies #AussiesLoudandProud #Truthophobes #DeportTheGrandMufti.\"\n\n\u201cGrand Mufti\u201d refers to the Islamic leader of a state. The current Grand Mufti of Australia is Dr Ibrahim Abu Mohammed, according to this page on the Australian National Imams Council website.\n\nThe same meme also appears with no caption in this Facebook post dated April 25, 2019, which has been shared hundreds of times.\n\nThe photo was not taken in Australia; it actually shows a Kashmiri activist named Shakeel Ahmad Bhat during a demonstration in Indian-administered Kashmir.\n\nThe photo was originally published by Associated Press (AP) on September 15, 2006, and appears here on the news agency's image site.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the image on the AP website:\n\nThe caption states: \u201cMembers of Muslim League Jammu Kashmir (MLJK) shout slogans during a demonstration in Srinagar, India, Friday, Sept. 15, 2006.\n\n\"Police detained dozen of members of MLJK after they took out a protest demonstration against Pope Benedict XVI for making what it called 'derogatory' comments about Islam, and seeking an apology from him for hurting the sentiments of Muslims. (AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool)\".\n\nAFP published a similar image of Bhat at the same demonstration here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo on AFP's image website:\n\nThe caption of that photo states: \u201cIn this picture taken, 15 September 2006, Indian Kashmiri Muslim Shakeel Bhat (R) joins Indian Kashmiri activists of the pro-Pakistani Muslim League Jammu Kashmir (MLJK) as they shout slogans against Pope Benedict XVI during a protest in Srinagar.\n\n\"He has become the face of Muslim fury: an angry young man whose bushy beard and fiery-eyed scowl take centre stage at nearly every pro-Islamic demonstration in Indian Kashmir.\n\n\"Shakeel Bhat, 31, has been displaying his teeth and shaking his fist over anything from Salman Rushdie's knighthood to Danish cartoons, becoming a photographers' favourite and earning himself the nickname 'Rage Boy' in online columns and blogs.\u201d\n\nThe misleading Facebook posts offered no evidence that Bhat has any connection to Australia, New Zealand, or Anzac Day.\n\nAFP spoke to Bhat's lawyer Mir Shafqat Hussain, who said:\n\n\"Shakeel Ahmed Bhat, known as Muslim Rage Boy is my client. He is at his home in Srinagar at the moment and regularly appears in the court here for numerous cases against him.\"\n\nSrinagar is a city in Indian-administered Kashmir, here it is on Google Maps.\n\nHussain added that Bhat doesn't have a passport and so cannot travel abroad.\n\nThe Guardian published this detailed profile about Bhat on July 23, 2007.", "lang": "en"}
