Francis \u201cChiz\u201d Escudero\u2019s words, as he opposed the extension of martial law in Mindanao during the Dec. 12 joint Congress session.\n\nIt carried a 12-minute Youtube video with a thumbnail purporting to quote Escudero as saying:\n\nEscudero made no such claim anywhere in the footage. The video, uploaded by TOKHANG TV, which has a history of posting false and misleading reports, featured a CNN Philippines live-stream of Escudero explaining his \u201cno\u201d vote on the proposed third martial law extension. The video extends to include AMIN Partylist Rep. Mending Makmod Jr.\u2019s statement.\n\nIn his statement, Escudero emphasized that the \u201cpositive reception\u201d of Mindanaoans is not a valid basis to extend martial rule in Mindanao till end-2019.\n\n\u201cRebellion at (and) invasion, at hindi pagpapanatili ng (and not the maintenance of) peace and order, pagpapaganda ng ekonomiya at hindi dahil gusto ng tao ang magiging basehan ng (improvement of the economy and the people\u2019s approval, should be the basis of) martial law,\u201d Escudero said.\n\nFilipnews.org\u2019s misleading story, which could have reached over 1.45 million people, was posted a day after both houses of congress jointly voted to extend martial law in Mindanao until the end of 2019.\n\nFilipnews.org was created in January 2018 and Tokhang TV in November 2016.\n\n(Editor's Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.
