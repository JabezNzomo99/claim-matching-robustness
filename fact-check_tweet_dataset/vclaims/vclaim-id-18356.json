They still are, but they were undisputed champions of terror, and that\u2019s a bad thing. And we had 14 different locations where they were fighting \u2026 between Yemen and Syria, but many other locations and many other battle sites. And it was all about Iran. They were behind every one of them. They\u2019re not doing that anymore. They\u2019re doing very poorly as a nation. They\u2019re failing as a nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook what has happened to Iran. Iran, when I first came into office, was a terror. They were fighting in many locations all over the Middle East. They were behind every single major attack, whether it was Syria, whether it was Yemen, whether it was individual smaller areas, whether it was taking away oil from people. They were involved with everything. Now they\u2019re pulling back because they\u2019ve got serious economic problems.\u201d\n\nIran has significant ties to Hezbollah, a Shiite Islamist political party and militant group in Lebanon that is considered a terrorist group by the United States and several other nations. Tehran has leveraged Hezbollah to intervene in Syria on behalf of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, another Iranian ally. Other militant groups, including Islamic Jihad and Hamas in Gaza, are backed by Iranian funding. Iran has also funded powerful Shiite political and militia forces in Iraq. And when Saudi Arabia became involved in the conflict in Yemen, Iran began backing the Houthi rebels to counter the kingdom\u2019s influence.\n\nIntense economic sanctions have been the Trump administration\u2019s primary method to push Iran toward meeting the demands. By Nov. 5 last year, these sanctions were as widespread as those under the Obama administration \u2014 just before negotiating the Iran nuclear deal. They have become even more expansive since, with the goal of bringing Iran\u2019s oil exports to \u201czero across the board,\u201d according to Pompeo.\n\nReports do indicate Hezbollah has seen its funding reduced in recent months, but, according to Dennis Ross, a former U.S. ambassador and a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, there is \u201cno indication whatsoever that Hezbollah is stopping any of its bad behavior.\u201d This reduction in funding also coincides with a downturn in the Lebanese economy and, therefore, may not solely be a result of sanctions.\n\nA report from the International Crisis Group looked at 40 years of Iran\u2019s economic performance and its regional activity. They found that even in times of extreme economic distress, Iran continued to supply its proxies. For example, when Iran\u2019s economy was struggling under the weight of revolution and the Iran-Iraq war, the country also began cultivating Hezbollah. And under the Obama administration\u2019s sanctions, when Iran\u2019s oil revenue was plummeting, Iran began its support of Houthi rebels in Yemen. There appears to be little correlation between Iran\u2019s support for proxies and shifts in its economy or oil revenue.\n\nTo start, the Iranian regime has begun to ignore restrictions on enriched uranium set by the nuclear deal. Until recently, Iran remained in compliance with the agreement and its remaining members: China, France, Germany, Russia and the United Kingdom. Now, Iran is stockpiling more than 300 kilograms of low-enriched uranium and enriching it beyond 3.67 percent purity. Neither puts Iran on the cusp of obtaining a nuclear weapon \u2014 which Iran insists it has no interest in building \u2014 but both are forbidden under the deal.\n\nOn May 4, the Trump administration announced it would not renew those waivers. This cut Iran\u2019s oil exports again, bringing them down to between 300,000 and 600,000 barrels a day. And this appears to be the turning point. Iran shifted from waiting out the Trump administration to what seems like direct action.", "lang": "en"}
