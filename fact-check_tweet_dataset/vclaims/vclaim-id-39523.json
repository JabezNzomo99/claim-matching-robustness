And does he face a long prison sentence because of it? No, that's not true: the story was made up by a website that invents false stories for entertainment purposes. It is not real.\n\nThe story went viral again via an article published by HMedia on October 23, 2018 titled \"Bill Nye The Science Guy Arrested For Manufacturing And Distribution Of Drugs From His Lab\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nLOS ANGELES - It is being confirmed that American scientist and television host Bill Nye, popularly known as 'Bill Nye the Science Guy', has been arrested for allegedly selling and manufacturing illegal drugs such as marijuana, acid, and crystal meth. Authorities say he was operating under the street name \"Slim Killa\". Bill Nye was arrested in his Los Angeles home after investigators became suspicious of Nye taking part of the sale and manufacture of illegal drugs. Investigators found pounds of illegal drugs and money in a secret basement in Bill Nye's home, including 6 Million dollars cash, 13 illegal firearms, 121 pounds of marijuana, 2 gallons of LSD, and 63 pounds of crystallized methamphetamine, commonly known as simply crystal meth, as well as boxes of condoms, women under garments, and a stripper pole in the very lab.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nHuzlersmedia is a sister site of \"fauxtire\" website Huzlers.com, using the same adverstising tags and being promoted through the same Facebook pages. It carries a disclaimer at the bottom of the page which reads:\n\nThe exact same hoax also appeared earlier on Huzlers.com back in 2015:\n\nSince 2015 Nye has appeared in several television shows so it is obvious the story was fake and he wasn't sent off to jail. And if it wasn't true back then you probably shouldn't believe it is now...\n\nWe wrote about huzlersmedia.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: New Scientific Study Did NOT Show 95% Of Men Who Wear Skinny Jeans Are Attracted To Men\n\u2022 Fake News: 28 Year-Old Rapper MGK Was NOT Found Dead At Recording Studio Due To LIGMA Overdose\n\u2022 Fake News: Man Did NOT Die From E.
