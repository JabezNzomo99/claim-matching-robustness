Along with the image, netizens are hinting at a link between Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and the virus.\n\nMany social media users have shared the picture of the crop circle, a pattern created by flattening crop in a field, along with the caption, \"This crop circle appeared recently, featuring the Coronavirus image and the Microsoft logo. Hinting at a link between Bill Gates and the virus?\"\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral picture is photoshopped. The original crop circle was created in a wheat field in Wiltshire, England, in 2004.\n\nWe also found other images of the crop circle (https://temporarytemples.co.uk/crop-circles/2004-2) from different angles.\n\nFor several weeks, many social media users have been targeting Bill Gates, claiming he is connected to the worldwide spread of coronavirus. One such viral claim says that a research institute founded by the Microsoft co-founder created the virus. Another says he has developed a vaccine that would control and depopulate the world through a microchip.\n\nConspiracy theories about Gates' connection to the Covid-19 pandemic can be read in detail here.\n\nIt is clear that the viral image of the crop circle combining the symbols of coronavirus and Microsoft is doctored. Claims of a connection between Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and the pandemic are also misplaced.
