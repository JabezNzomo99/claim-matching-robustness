Elizabeth Warren said, \u201cIf Republicans disarm, all is well and good. If they refuse to disarm, we shall disarm them ourselves.\u201d\n\nThere is no record of Warren ever making this statement.\n\nWarren, a Democratic senator for Massachusetts, announced her 2020 presidential bid in February 2019. (RELATED: \u2018That\u2019s Just Human Nature\u2019 \u2013 Did Dianne Feinstein Say This Quote About Gun Control?)\n\nMonths later, in August, she unveiled her gun control plan ahead of the third Democratic primary debate. Her plan, which proposes measures like universal background checks and an assault weapons ban, aims to reduce gun violence by 80 percent. There is no gun buyback plan included in her proposal, though other candidates like former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke have called for such action.\n\nYet, while her campaign platform does include gun control measures, there is no evidence that Warren said the quote attributed to her in the Facebook post. It doesn\u2019t appear on her Twitter accounts or in ProPublica\u2019s archive of her deleted tweets. A search of the congressional record didn\u2019t yield any results either.\n\nThe alleged quote, debunked by Snopes in 2016, bears some resemblance to a statement made by Joseph Stalin, a leader of the Soviet Union. According to the Marxist Internet Archive, Stalin employed similar words during a 1927 speech, saying, \u201cIf the opposition disarms \u2013 well and good. If it refuses to disarm \u2013 we shall disarm it ourselves.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
