But the focus of this fact-check is on the ABC News/Washington Post poll, because that\u2019s the one Trump singled out in his tweet.\n\nAccording to Gallup and ABC News/Washington Post polling data, the average six-month presidential approval rating is around 62 percent \u2014 well above Trump\u2019s approval rating of 36 percent.\n\nThe results look even bleaker when Trump\u2019s numbers are placed side-by-side with other presidents.\n\nAccording to data compiled by ABC News, Trump has the worst approval rating in the last seven decades compared to other presidents at roughly the same period in their presidency.\n\nThe second worst approval rating is that of President Gerald Ford, at 39 percent.\n\nTrump\u2019s net approval rating (percent approval minus disapproval) of -22 percent is also a historic low since presidential polling of this kind began.\n\nOnly two other presidents \u2014 Bill Clinton and Ford \u2014 had negative net approval ratings at this point in their tenure.\n\n\"Politicians always want to claim they are doing well in the polls,\" said Karlyn Bowman, a polling expert at the American Enterprise Institute. \"But Donald Trump\u2019s claim that his ratings are \u2018not bad\u2019 compared to other president\u2019s doesn\u2019t square with available historical data, which shows his approval rating below all presidents for whom we have data at this point in their presidencies.\"\n\nTrump said his six-month approval poll numbers are \"not bad\" relative to other presidents at this point in his presidency.\n\nNot bad isn\u2019t a scientific term, but by any sober measure Trump is performing relatively worse compared to his contemporaries, as well as any president since World War II.", "lang": "en"}
