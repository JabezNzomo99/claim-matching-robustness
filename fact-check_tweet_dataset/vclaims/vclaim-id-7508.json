No, that's not true: that was made up by a military satire website. It did not happen.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Duffel Blog on May 24, 2018 titled \"Mattis says Trump asked the difference between Navy SEALs and seals\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump asked his defense secretary to explain whether seals and Navy SEALs were the same thing during a recent national security briefing, sources confirmed today. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis at one point had to mime a special operator raising a rifle while rising out of the water in contrast to a picture of a lovable marine mammal that lives in the ocean, officials said. The president's question about the differences between SEALs and seals came just days after he reportedly asked Microsoft founder Bill Gates whether HPV and HIV were the same.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe website Duffelblog.com is a military-themed satire website which sports following legal disclaimer on its 'about' page:\n\nWe are in no way, shape, or form, a real news outlet.

The gaffe was cleared up in May 2012 when Duffel Blog staff successfully conducted an airborne assault on the offices of The Onion News Network so that others would know \"The Onion was actually the civilian version of Duffel Blog.\"\n\nSo don't fall for any of their stories...\n\nWe wrote about duffelblog.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Navy NOT To Christen Ship USS Tig Ol Bitties After People Vote Online\n\u2022 Fake News: Presidential Helicopter Marine One Did NOT Crash Into The White House\n\u2022 Fake News: Kim Jong-un Did NOT Defect To South Korea\n\u2022 Fake News: Army Did NOT Calls For 200,000-man Detail to Fill Sandbags on US-Mexico Border", "lang": "en"}
