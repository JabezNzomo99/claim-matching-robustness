Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., disapproved.\n\nThe Coke ad, featuring \"America the Beautiful\" sung in , a backlash on Twitter and criticism from conservatives who objected to hearing parts of the patriotic song performed in tongues other than English.\n\n\"If English was good enough for Jesus when he wrote the Bible it should be good enough for Coke,\" Bachmann is quoted as saying in the graphic posted Feb. 3, 2014, by \"Christians for Michele Bachmann.\" It attributes the alleged quote to a Fox News appearance that same day.\n\nBachmann, a former presidential candidate, making English the official language of the U.S., but we found no evidence that she uttered the \"good enough for Jesus\" line.\n\nBachmann spokesman Dan Kotman told us by email, \"Congresswoman Bachmann never said that quote, and actually didn\u2019t even appear on Fox News that day. It\u2019s 100 percent fake.\"\n\nIt\u2019s fake \u2014 and not even new. A hoax-debunking blog called Waffles at Noon collected 2013 versions of the Bachmann meme in a Feb. 4, 2014, , and said the earliest one also bore the logo of which it described as a satirical Facebook page.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t start with Bachmann. We found that the \"Bible written in English\" line is so old it was used to make fun of Texas\u2019 1925-27 governor, Miriam Ferguson, to whom versions have also been attributed.\n\nAnd it\u2019s even older than that, tracing back to at least 1881.\n\nWall Street Journal language columnist Benjamin Zimmer investigated the \"Bible in English\" meme in an April 29, 2006, on a linguists\u2019 blog at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe oldest iterations, he wrote, were jokes about an 1881 translation of the Bible, rather than about the English language specifically.\n\nZimmer cited a May 23, 1881, New York Times about clergymen\u2019s reactions to the new Bible. One preacher, the story says, told his congregation a joke that ended thus: \" \u2019What's the matter with the good old King James version?\u2019 the farmer replied. \u2018That was good enough for St. Paul, and it's good enough for me.\u2019 \"\n\nWord sleuth Barry Popik of New York, a onetime Texas resident who has compiled an online etymological dictionary, investigated the Texas connection in an Aug. 10, 2006, on his website.\n\nPopik wrote that quotations such as \"If English was good enough for Jesus, it\u2019s good enough for Texas\" were attributed to Ferguson or her husband, also a former governor, as commentary on a period of Texas history when there was controversy over public schools teaching in Spanish.\n\nThe Facebook post claims Bachmann said, \"If English was good enough for Jesus when he wrote the Bible, it should be good enough for Coke.\"\n\nIt\u2019s a line so old, you\u2019d have thought its fizz was gone. Pants on Fire!\n\nPANTS ON FIRE \u2013 The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.\n\nClick here for on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
