The advisory came as tensions with China have escalated in the past few weeks, leading to the death of at least 20 Indian army soldiers in Ladakh\u2019s Galwan Valley.\n\nFollowing these reports, government-affiliated PIB Fact Check tweeted that no such advisory has been issued by the UP STF. \u201cA claim viral on social media says that STF has advised against the use of certain apps. This news is false. STF has not issued any such advisory.

This was confirmed to Alt News by IG STF Amitabh Yash. Furthermore, the order was tweeted by several journalists including UP-based reporter Piyush Rai.\n\nJournalists Prashant Srivastava,Qazi Faraz Ahmad and Sachin Gupta also said that IG Yash and other STF officials confirmed that the internal order was issued.\n\nUP-based news outlet BSTV, whose screenshot was featured in PIB\u2019s tweet, shared a video where the advisory is seen pinned to the notice board of the STF office. The complete broadcast of the channel can be watched here. BSTV specifies during the show that the order was issued by UP police.\n\nFurthermore, there are several videos of the statement given by ADG Prashant Kumar where he informs about the advisory.\n\nThe media rightly reported that an internal advisory was ordered by the UP STF however, PIB Fact Check declared the reports \u201cfake news\u201d. PIB has emerged as the latest tool for bullying journalists and the press. During reports of migrant workers losing their lives in Shramik special trains, PIB declared in mere sentences that the workers (or their deceased family members) suffered from pre-existing conditions. PIB did not provide any medical records and termed media reports as \u201cfake news\u201d despite the kin of the workers stating that the deceased were not previously ill.
