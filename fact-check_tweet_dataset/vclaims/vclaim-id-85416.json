But we were especially puzzled by his claim that \u201csomebody\u201d put out the concept of a 100-day plan and that he\u2019s \u201cmostly there on most items.\u201d\n\nIn a campaign speech on Oct. 22 delivered in Gettysburg, Pa., Trump outlined at substantive length each law he pledged to pass in his first 100 days. Here\u2019s a screengrab of the news release on his campaign website.\n\n\u201cHe set a newly serious tone \u2026 Donald Trump Saturday outlined an ambitious plan for his first 100 days in office \u2026 Trump\u2019s \u2018Gettysburg address\u2019 makes closing argument for choosing him and unveils first-100-days agenda as he promises \u2018the kind of change that only arrives once in a lifetime\u2019\u2026 Trump says his \u201c100 day action plan\u201d is a contract between him and the American voter.\u201d\n\nAt the Fact Checker, we used his 100-day plan as a template for tracking the president\u2019s promises. Trump had made some 280 promises on the campaign trail, many that were contradictory, but this was a specific plan of action that he had said would guide his administration from the first day. He even signed the \u201cContract with the American Voter\u201d with his distinctive signature. And Trump touted it again with a video he recorded during the transition.\n\nThere were 60 promises embedded in the plan. According to our tally as of April 24, Trump has failed to meet most of his objectives. Of the 60 promises, he has kept five and broken five. Eleven other promises have been launched, two are stuck and one resulted in a compromise. He has taken no action on 36 promises \u2014 60 percent of them.\n\nWe relied on Trump\u2019s \u201cContract with the American Voter\u201d because, given that it had his signature, we figured there would be little chance he would try to distance himself from this set of promises. Apparently we were wrong.", "lang": "en"}
