A situation where Russia is going to be frozen out of diplomatic relationships, of economic relationships, because of this, is certainly not something that Russia would want. I think they have got to make their own choice, their own calculations.\u201d\n\nVolker\u2019s comments to the Financial Times came just days after he met with his Russian counterpart Vladislav Surkov to revive stalled efforts to resolve the conflict, which has already claimed more than 10,000 lives.\n\nBut no major progress has been made, prompting Volker to emphasize the continuity of sanctions imposed on Russia for its annexation of Crimea and actions in eastern Ukraine.\n\n\u201cRussia has forces in eastern Ukraine and it needs to pull them out,\u201d he said.\n\nRussia has denied it has troops in eastern Ukraine, despite contrary claims by NATO and the United States.\n\nThe cease-fire remains fragile, with violations impeding the work of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM) and the situation threatening to spiral into an outright war.\n\n\u200bOn August 28, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron urged Moscow and Kyiv to step up their efforts to implement the ceasefire deal while warning of continued threats faced by Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) personnel in both Kyiv- and rebel-controlled territories.\n\n\u201cThe OSCE observer mission continues to report threats to its staff and restrictions on their freedom of movement, particularly in the areas not controlled by the Ukrainian government,\u201d Merkel and Macron said in a joint statement.\n\nOn August 29, Merkel said sanctions against Russia would be lifted if Moscow agreed to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n\nBut concerns remain that Russia might be seeking to transform the crisis into a frozen conflict.", "lang": "en"}
