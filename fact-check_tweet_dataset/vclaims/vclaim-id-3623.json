They added that the proposals were not rejected because vaccinations would be \u201charmful,\u201d but because \u201call health care in Sweden, including vaccination programs, is voluntary.\u201d\n\nConspiracy theory blogs also reported that the Riksdagen \u201cbanned\u201d mandatory vaccinations. What it did not mention is that the country\u2019s voluntary vaccination program, which covers ten diseases, already dates back decades.\n\nWhile Sweden\u2019s program is voluntary, the vast majority of children are still vaccinated; the Folkhalsomyndigheten spokesperson told us, \u201cMore than 97 percent of the 2 year olds have been vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella, for example.\u201d Overall, however, the country experienced an increase in measles cases in 2017. The European Centers for Disease Control reported that Sweden was one of 18 nations where the number of cases reported during the first half of 2017 exceeded that of the same period a year earlier.\n\nYourNewsWire.com and similar blogs sourced their stories from a report from an \u201calternative health\u201d group, the National Health Federation. However, this group has come under its share of scrutiny and criticism. For example, the American Cancer Society excoriated the group in a report concerning \u201cunproven methods\u201d of managing the disease, saying:\n\nAfter study of the literature and other available information, the American Cancer Society has found no evidence that methods of treatment promoted by the National Health Federation (NHF) result in objective benefit in the treatment of cancer in human beings. Lacking such evidence, the American Cancer Society strongly urges individuals with cancer not to seek treatment based on the recommendations of the NHF.", "lang": "en"}
