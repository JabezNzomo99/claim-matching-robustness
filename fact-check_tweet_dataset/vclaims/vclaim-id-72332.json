The article quotes a senior Trump campaign official saying that the campaign has \"three major voter suppression operations under way.\"\n\nThe article doesn\u2019t offer any more details about the source other than the fact the person was a \"senior official.\"\n\nAccording to the Bloomberg story, the suppression operations are targeting white liberals, young women and African Americans through radio spots, social media and targeting specific neighborhoods.\n\nWhat specifically is Trump telling those groups?\n\nClinton\u2019s 1996 remark where she suggests some African-American males are \"super predators\" is being used in social media posts aimed at discouraging African-Americans from voting. The group of women who say they were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and degraded by Hillary Clinton are meant to dismantle young women\u2019s positive views of Clinton and so on.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only article that quotes an unidentified Trump adviser making a similar claim.\n\nTrump\u2019s \"advisers\" told the Wall Street Journal the campaign is trying to \"depress Democratic voter turnout.\"\n\nAfter news broke of Trump\u2019s 2005 lewd comments about sexual assault and women, the Trump campaign implemented a \"scorched earth strategy\" to keep voters home on Nov. 8, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nJust like what was reported in the Bloomberg article, Trump advisers told the Wall Street Journal that Trump was looking to use the attacks over Clinton\u2019s email server and allegations about her husband to keep Clinton supporters home on election day.\n\nThere\u2019s also a Yahoo News article with a similar story from another unidentified source.\n\nThere are caveats that come with Clinton\u2019s claim.\n\nFirst, we can\u2019t independently verify if Trump officials said these things. Trump, himself, has said not to trust articles that don\u2019t name specific sources.\n\nAlso, publicly, Trump has gone to great lengths to court women and African-American voters. He has called for six weeks of mandatory paid maternity leave and tax credits for child care. And he has tried to attract African-Americans by touting his business plan, saying the Clinton and Democrats have failed.\n\n\"What the hell do you have to lose?\" said Trump, asking for black voters' support.\n\nFurther, experts say what the media reports are describing are not all that shocking or atypical. In some ways, Clinton is describing modern-day politics warts and all.\n\nTobe Berkovitz, an associate professor of advertising at Boston University, who has worked as a political media consultant for presidential campaigns, said it\u2019s likely that Trump\u2019s campaign is trying to curb Clinton voters with negative campaigning.\n\nHe said this is not unusual because modern politics based in negativity is an inherent part of campaigns, adding that negative campaigning \"discourages the hell out of all voters.\"\n\nIf you look at Trump\u2019s strategy as negative campaigning, then it seems that Trump is not trying to suppress voters, but depress them.\n\nClinton said, \"Donald Trump's strategy is pretty simple. They have even said in his campaign it's to get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, get people of color to stay home, and get a lot get a lot of smart, intelligent men to stay home, too.\"\n\nTrump never literally told women, young people, people of color and \"intelligent men,\" to stay home on Nov. 8. Clinton\u2019s remark refers to news articles that quote anonymous sources from the campaign saying the strategy is to reduce turnout for Clinton by targeting specific groups of people, including young people, women and people of color.\n\nYet Trump himself has tried to woo women and African-Americans on the campaign trail and said anonymous-sourced stories from his campaign should not be trusted.\n\nLastly, experts say what Clinton is describing is a fairly typical type of negative campaigning.\n\nClinton\u2019s statement is partially accurate.
