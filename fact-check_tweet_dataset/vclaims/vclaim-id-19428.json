In the post, there is also an image that has a statement purportedly made by Kovind \u2013 \u2018to progress, there is no necessity of reservations\u2019. Let\u2019s try to analyze the authenticity of the claims made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: President Ram Nath Kovind has said \u2018now there is no need for reservations; to progress, there is no necessity for reservations\u2019 Fact: President Ram Nath Kovind hasn\u2019t made those statements. No credible source was found to authenticate the claim. The newspaper clip seen in the post is a digitally created one. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nA newspaper-clip with the date December 16, 2017, was used in the post. When searched for that clip, nothing was found. When googled to check if President Kovind has made the statements claimed in the post, no supporting information was found. If President Kovind had really made such statements, owing to their sensitivity, they would have been reported by major newspapers and channels in India. So, the clip posted on Facebook isn\u2019t an authentic one, it is a digitally manufactured clip.\n\nWhen the photo in the post is cropped and subjected to reverse image search technique, it was found in a YouTube video of President Kovind addressing Andhra University in Visakhapatnam on December 7, 2017. In the video, Kovind hasn\u2019t made any statements attributed to him in the post.\n\nDuring the search process, it was found that, in 2010 when Kovind was BJP\u2019s spokesperson, he opposed the recommendation of Ranganath Misra commission that proposed to offer reservations in government jobs for the religious minorities. Ranganath Misra Commission was constituted by the Government of India in 2004 to look into various issues related to Linguistic and Religious minorities in India.\n\nTo sum it up, President Ram Nath Kovind did not make those statements on reservations.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
