But, FACTLY has found that the video is an old one and it is not related to any recent incident. The video is found to exist on social media at least since March 2019. FACTLY was unable to find the exact location and the context of the incident in the video. As it was found to exist since the last year, it can be concluded that it is in no way related to the recent violence in West Bengal. Recently, in the Hooghly district of the State, violence erupted between Hindus & Muslims over a dispute regarding the usage of a public toilet during the lockdown.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
