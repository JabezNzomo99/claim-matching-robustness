They do not understand that subsidies & Freebees mean borrowing & borrowing have to be paid one day by someone.\n\nIndian public also not bothered about GDP rate it increasesed from 3.8 to 7.4 from last four years which is more then USA, UK , japan.....\n\n- Indian public will always complain. If it is not about price of Onions or Thur Dal, it will be about Petrol or Diesel. They must get everything cheap but at the same time Farmers must get good price\n\n- Don't ask Indian public to change old habits. It is Govt's job to change everything\n\n- Indian public is not bothered about fixing long term issues. They want it today. Not even today. NOW.\n\n-they intextualy vote as per cast pattern.... Castisum is major enemy for Indian politics which divides indian youth from growth... And PaK and chine pramote castisum in India with help of there own native peoples because both directly depends on India for open market..GDP.....\n\nIndian defence system are more stronger as compared to last five years and PaK and gulf countrys are not able to ruled on India...thier for they fundings in billion to destroy Indian system and only Modi is fight against them......but Indian don't know this..\n\nIf Mr. Modi continues fixing long term problems for remaining 5 months, he will loose 2019. A dead soldier can not do anything for country. He must live to comeback for next 5 years. Now he must become a politician for remaining 5 months. If Public wants cheap Petrol & Diesel give to them. If farmers want loan waiver, give it to them,\n\nThey don't know about sabka sath sabaka vikas\n\nWe advise to Mr. Modi will be to apply for 5 month's leave from being statesman & become politician. After 2019 victory back to being statesman because India can only grow under statesman Modi & not Politician Modi.", "lang": "en"}
