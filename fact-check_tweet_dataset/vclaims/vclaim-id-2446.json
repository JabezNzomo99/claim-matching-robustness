The article claims in its headline that \u201craw manuka honey kills every bacteria scientists throw at it, including antibiotic-resistant superbugs\u201d.\n\nScientists who reviewed this claim found it to be generally accurate. They explained that manuka honey, which is derived from the flowers of the manuka tree (Leptospermum scoparium), does indeed have potent antibacterial properties. These properties derive from the honey\u2019s complex mix of naturally-occurring bacterial toxins\u2014most notably methylglyoxal (MGO)[1], which is unique to manuka honey, and glucose oxidase.\n\nFurthermore, the properties of honey in general, such as its high sugar content and low pH, create a hostile environment for bacterial growth. And no studies have yet reported development of bacterial resistance to manuka honey, unlike their widespread resistance to many antibiotics. Altogether, these properties make manuka honey a highly effective dressing which reduces wound infection.\n\nAlthough the blog post contains many true statements, it also contains inaccurate and misleading information. For example, the image included in the post of a person eating a honeycomb implies that consuming manuka honey\u2014rather than applying it directly to a wound\u2014similarly protects against bacterial infection. This is false, because the antibacterial chemicals contained in manuka honey lose their potency when digested.\n\nManuka honey is also not an absolute defense against all bacteria; for example, this study published in 2016 showed that manuka honey was not able to inhibit growth of the bacteria Enterococcus faecalis in biofilms[2].\n\nThe article also fails to mention that the medical-grade manuka honey used in wound dressings is processed and sterilized differently from manuka honey intended for consumption. The process used to produce medical-grade honey requires less heat in order to preserve its antibacterial properties. Therefore, food-grade honey may be less effective if used in wound dressings.\n\nThis article in The Conversation, written by two of our reviewers, provides an in-depth discussion of manuka honey\u2019s medicinal properties.\n\n\n\n Shona Blair, Head of Research Strategy, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London:\n\n General comments:\n\n The biggest issue with the article is that although it does not say so directly, it infers that eating manuka honey will cure infections. This is absolutely not true.\n\nIt is true that manuka is incredibly active against many, many different types of bacterial pathogens\u2014including many types of superbugs (this review outlines the different organisms susceptible to manuka[3]\u2014Note: I am declaring that I am an author).\n\nHowever, this activity of manuka stems from its topical use. That is, it needs to come directly into contact with the organisms causing the infection in order to kill them. It is an excellent wound dressing, with a number of ideal dressing properties, including its ability to clear infection, but it does not behave as a systemic antimicrobial. So eating it will not cure an infection. Also see this article that I co-wrote for clarification.\n\nOther comments on the article:\n\n The term \u201c\u2018raw\u2019 manuka honey\u201d really bothers me. People marketing honey often use the term \u201craw\u201d, and although this is not an official term, it is generally used to imply that the particular honey has not been heated or filtered above a certain, but undefined, extent. There are often claims or inferences that \u201craw\u201d honey is \u201cmore nutritious\u201d or \u201cbetter for you\u201d than \u201csupermarket\u201d honey. However, in terms of eating good-quality honey, its micronutrient profile is not overly affected by most commercial processing.\n\nMost honey in a jar has usually undergone some heating and filtration\u2014it\u2019s pretty hard to get a jar of honey free of bits of bees and wax without filtering, and this is much easier if the honey is somewhat warm.\n\nIn terms of the antimicrobial activity, minimally processed honey is generally more active than the varieties that have undergone significant heating. Heat (and/or long-term exposure to light if packed in clear jars) can destroy the enzyme (called glucose oxidase) that is responsible for the production of hydrogen peroxide\u2014the main factor behind the antibacterial properties of most honeys. However, the reason for antibacterial activity in manuka honey is different (it\u2019s due to MGO), and this is more stable. However, high level, long-term heat still is not a good idea for honey to be used medicinally. So, medicinal honeys for wound care are usually processed differently to honeys that are just for eating.\n\nI think the \u201craw\u201d issue gets tangled with the honey fraud one. Unfortunately, there are cases where unscrupulous honey packers add sugar syrups to bulk out their products. This does happen, and regrettably, it is hard to impossible for consumers to tell if it has happened in most cases (there are a whole bunch of silly articles online about how to tell depending on how it does or doesn\u2019t dissolve in water\u2014not true). The best protection for consumers is to buy direct from beekeepers or to buy reputable brands from supermarkets/health food shops. If the price is too good to be true\u2014it is probably just that.\n\nNural Cokcetin, Postdoctoral Research Fellow, ithree Institute, University of Sydney:\n\n The article in question does \u201csensationalise\u201d the scientific claims, unfortunately. Manuka honey\u2014and many other honey types\u2014has a potent antibacterial activity that can inhibit (slow down the growth of and/or kill) many types of different bacteria, including those that are resistant to antibiotics (aka \u201csuperbugs\u201d). The antibacterial activity of honey comes from a number of factors:\n\u2022 High concentration of sugar: this can dehydrate the bacteria, or make it \u201ctoo dry\u201d for bacteria to survive.\n\u2022 Low pH: honey is acidic and most bacteria can\u2019t tolerate acidic conditions.\n\u2022 Production of hydrogen peroxide: this is toxic to bacteria and some, but not all, honeys have this type of activity. It is very dependent on the floral source of the honey and can also be influenced by environmental, processing, and storage conditions.\n\nIn some very rare honeys, like manuka and related manuka-type honeys in New Zealand and Australia, there are some floral factors that offer an added antibacterial activity. The main component in these manuka-type honeys that gives the added antibacterial activity is called methylglyoxal (MGO or MG), and it is derived from another naturally-occurring compound in the nectar of some manuka plants.\n\nThe term \u201craw\u201d is used more for marketing purposes than anything else\u2014the honeys used in the scientific studies cited in the article use medical-grade manuka honey [e.g. MediHoney (R)], which means that it has been sterilised and tested for a minimum level of activity that is deemed suitable for clinical use.\n\nIt is true that there are no reports about bacteria that are resistant to the antibacterial effects of honey, and even in the lab we cannot generate honey-resistant bacteria\u2014and this is very different in the case of antibiotics, where we can make antibiotic-resistant bacteria very quickly in the lab and antibiotic-resistant bacteria are reported for many, many of the antibiotics we currently have available. We also know that honey can stop the formation of bacterial biofilms (communities of bacteria\u2014often implicated in chronic infections) and eradicate biofilms if they have already formed.\n\nFor more information on manuka honey specifically (with links to relevant scientific articles), please see this piece I co-authored in The Conversation.\n\nDee A. Carter, Professor in Microbiology, School of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Sydney:\n\n I would consider this claim to be of high credibility.\n\nThe facts are basically correct but there are some errors and deficiencies in reporting:\n\nThe article would be better if it included links to some of the \u201cdozens of studies\u201d that it describes. It\u2019s true that there have been lots of studies to show this but the article\u2019s lack of links reduces its credibility. Among the only two scientific references in the article, one incorrectly describes a 2014 study as a \u201csurvey\u201d, when it is actually a primary study of the effect of manuka honey on biofilms[4].\n\nAlthough the report appears to cite me [\u201cCompounds like methylglyoxal in Manuka honey apparently cause multi-system failure in the bacteria \u2026 explains University of Sydney microbiologist Dee Carter.\u201d], I did not actually make this statement. I would have said that it is that manuka honey contains multiple antibacterial properties including methylglyoxal (MGO) and this causes a multisystem failure in the bacteria.\n\nIt would be better if the report stated that the honey must be from a reputable source from New Zealand or Australia and should have a UMF (Unique Manuka Factor) or MGO rating because there are a lot of fakes out there, and judging from the comments, many people are falling for these.\n\nMarcela Bucekova, Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore:\n\n Honey has antimicrobial activity and is very efficient against multi-drug resistant bacteria because of its multifactorial action\u2014high sugar content, low pH, bee-derived proteins (glucose oxidase, which generates hydrogen peroxide, and antimicrobial peptides such as defensin-1), and plant-derived compounds according to the type of honey (methylglyoxal, polyphenols, phytochemicals). Manuka-type honeys stand out because they are the most extensively studied, so the mechanism of action is better known than that of other types of honey. Manuka-type honeys contain an additional antimicrobial component called methylglyoxal, or MGO, which forms from the nectar-derived precursor compound, dihydroxyacetone (DHA), during the ripening of honey.\n\nA review written by Maddocks and Jenkins from the Cardiff School of Health Sciences nicely summarizes honey\u2019s antibacterial action[4]. Since this review was published, the focus has been more on uncovering the mechanism behind why honeys are so effective, not only against solitary bacteria but also against biofilm-forming bacteria[2,5,6,7]. In addition, it has been shown that various components of honey have immunomodulatory and wound healing activities[8,9].\n\u2022 2 \u2013 Sojka et al.
