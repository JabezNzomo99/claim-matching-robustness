America\u2019s real pastime is an economic behemoth that can\u2019t be stopped.\n\n\"Last week\u2019s three most-viewed television programs were Sunday Night Football, Thursday Night Football and Monday Night Football,\" he said. \"And money talks and it will continue to talk. And this will pass over, and football will go on its merry way.\"\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that professional football has a big TV audience.\n\nWe wanted to know just how big.\n\nTo check Will\u2019s claim we looked to a of shows by the Nielsen Company, which tracks consumer trends, including television viewership, from the week of Monday, Sept. 8, through Sunday, Sept. 14. It is the most-recent week available.\n\nThat Monday, TMZ released a video showing Rice punching his now-wife in an elevator. On the same day, the Baltimore Ravens terminated their contract with Rice, and Goodell announced that Rice was on indefinite suspension. Later in the week, the that NFL executives were supposedly aware of this video months earlier.\n\nNielsen has separate top-10 lists for broadcast television and cable television. Because Monday Night Football appears on ESPN, we decided to combine the lists into one overall ranking. Here are the top 10 shows and their viewership (in millions) that week:\n\nAs you can see, there\u2019s a lot of love for professional football. Americans don\u2019t just love the games -- they love the pregame shows, too.\n\nThe popularity of the pregame shows on NBC and CBS pushed the Monday Night Football game between the New York Giants and Detroit Lions to No. 5. So Will\u2019s comment, by Nielsen\u2019s metrics, is a tad off.\n\nStill, the point holds: Pro football games and pre- and post-game analysis dominated 8 out of 10 of the top 10 shows. Only CBS\u2019 America\u2019s Got Talent and 60 Minutes cracked the list.\n\nOf course, excitement for NFL games is high since the season started just a couple weeks ago, and the networks\u2019 fall television programming hasn\u2019t fully kicked in just yet.\n\nEven so, NFL games and analysis will continue to dominate the rankings as the season goes on, said Marc Berman, , in an interview with PunditFact.\n\nWhen new shows begin to air, the number of \"households using television\" goes up, but they don\u2019t take viewers away from football, Berman said. The popularity of the teams playing and whether the game is exciting have a bigger effect on football viewership ratings.\n\nIn the 2013-14 season, NBC\u2019s Sunday Night Football was the primetime show, with 21.7 million average viewers. ESPN\u2019s Monday Night Football was the No. 1 most-viewed cable television show in 2013.\n\nThe NFL holds in the fall of 2013. (The odd one out was NBC\u2019s Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Parade at No. 22.)\n\nAnd in four of the past five years, the Super Bowl has for the most-watched television event in history.\n\nProfessional football stands out from other sports, said Dan Lebowitz, executive director of Northeastern University\u2019s Center for the Study of Sports and Society. In football, there are only 16 games in a typical season -- as opposed to baseball\u2019s 162 games and basketball\u2019s 82 games -- so each game becomes a major event.\n\nThe rise of fantasy football has further solidified the sport\u2019s popularity, Lebowitz said.\n\nThe scandals involving Rice and other NFL standouts can\u2019t make even a small dent in this trend because of football\u2019s widespread popularity and importance in American culture, Berman said.\n\n\"Football will outlive all of us,\" he said.\n\nWill said, \"Last week\u2019s three most-viewed television programs were Sunday Night Football, Thursday Night Football and Monday Night Football.\"\n\nFootball games and related programming accounted for eight of the top 10 most-viewed TV programs between Sept. 8-14, 2014.\n\nEven though Monday Night Football came in fifth, not third, Will was right to say that football dominated the rankings. Experts say it will continue to do just that. We rate this claim True.", "lang": "en"}
