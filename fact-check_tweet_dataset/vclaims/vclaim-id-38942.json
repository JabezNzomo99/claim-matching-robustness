The claim is misleading; the non-profit organisation cited in the posts, Clean Up Australia, said the image does not relate to any of its events; photos of other Clean Up Australia events show children supporting environmental clean up operations.\n\nThe image was published below an image of a climate change protest in this Facebook post on March 1, 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe text superimposed on the top image in the meme reads: \"Australian kids taking a day off school to protest about saving the environment.\"\n\nThe text superimposed on the bottom image reads: \"Australian kids giving up their Sunday to join Clean Up Australia and help the environment\"\n\nClean Up Australia is a non-profit environmental organisation that has organised volunteer clean up days since 1990.
