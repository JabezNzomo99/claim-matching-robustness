Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim and the authenticity of the rankings.\n\n\n\nClaim: NDTV has been ranked 17th in the list of \u2018Top 100 World News Websites\u2019 as impartial and honest. Fact: NDTV was ranked 17th among \u2018Top 100 World News Websites\u2019 in a survey that was published by a blogging website, \u2018Feedspot\u2019. The website has mentioned that the survey was based on \u2018search and social metrics\u2019. The survey did not rank websites based on \u2018impartiality and honesty\u2019. Also, there is no credible organisation that gives rankings to news channels based on their impartiality and honesty. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched on Google with the keywords \u2018NDTV 17th position World\u2019, it was found that it was the blogging website \u2018Feedspot\u2019 that has ranked NDTV at 17th position in the \u2018Top 100 World News Websites to follow in 2019\u2019. In the article, it was mentioned that the rankings were given based on \u2018search and social metrics\u2019, but not on \u2018impartiality and honesty\u2019. So, the rankings were not related to impartiality or honesty. Also, in the rankings, it can be found that \u2018Times of India\u2019 is placed above \u2018NDTV\u2019 at 14th position.\n\nWhile the blogging website has mentioned that rankings were based on \u2018search and social metrics\u2019, there was no mention of the data sources and the methodology followed to rank the news websites. Also, no previous year rankings were found on the website. Here is some additional information about \u2018Feedspot\u2019.\n\nThe blogging website mentions \u2018Anuj Aggarwal\u2019 as the founder and his \u2018LinkedIn\u2019 account confirms it. When searched on Google for information about the website, it was found that \u2018Wikipedia\u2019 page of \u2018Feedspot\u2019 has been deleted. But from an article of \u2018Life Hacker\u2019 it was found that the website offers features like reading the news, sub-feeds for tags, starred items, and favourites, and tons of social features for sharing stories.\n\nWhen searched on Twitter, the account of \u2018Feedspot\u2019 was found, and it has just 977 followers till the time of writing this article.\n\nSo, it can be concluded that the survey which ranked NDTV as 17th \u2018Top World News Website\u2019 was published by a little known blogging website \u2018Feedspot\u2019 and the ranking was not based on impartiality and honesty.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Indian Rivers?", "lang": "en"}
