The Twitter account mentioned in the viral post (@Rntata200) did not exist on Twitter.\n\nAfter the Indian Air Force (IAF) airstrikes in Pakistan post the Pulwama terror attack, Tata had tweeted congratulating Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the IAF for the successful air strikes on the terrorist training camps in Pakistan.", "lang": "en"}
