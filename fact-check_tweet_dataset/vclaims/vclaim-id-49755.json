The low quality of the video created the impression that the musician who Biden introduced as Michael Jackson was in blackface makeup, but he was, in fact, actually African-American. He was identified as Jerome Powell, a D.C.-based performer.\n\nBiden\u2019s remarks at the dinner have been criticized for being racially insensitive, but assertions that he participated in a blackface skit are incorrect.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
