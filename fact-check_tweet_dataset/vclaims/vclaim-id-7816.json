That\u2019s a matter of opinion. However, it\u2019s not accurate to say Obama \u201crepeatedly failed to express solidarity\u201d with the protesters. If anything, it was the opposite:\n\u2022 On June 15, 2009, on the third day of protests, Obama said he was \u201cdeeply troubled by the violence\u201d against protesters and urged Iranian leaders to respect \u201cthe ability of people to peacefully dissent.\u201d\n\u2022 On June 20, 2009, Obama urged the Iranian government \u201cto stop all violent and unjust actions against its own people,\u201d and declared that the U.S. \u201cstands with all who seek to exercise\u201d free speech and the right of assembly.\n\u2022 On June 23, 2009, Obama said: \u201cI strongly condemn these unjust actions, and I join with the American people in mourning each and every innocent life that is lost.\u201d\n\nPence made his remarks in a Jan. 3 opinion piece in the Washington Post. The vice president praised President Donald Trump for his response to the latest wave of Iranian protests, which started on Dec. 28, 2017, in the city of Mashad over economic conditions and soon spread elsewhere in Iran.\n\nA day after the protests started, the State Department issued a statement saying the U.S. \u201cstrongly condemns the arrest of peaceful protesters.\u201d On the same day, Trump tweeted his support for the protesters.\n\nIn his op-ed, Pence compared the U.S. response now with what happened in 2009, when supporters of former Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi protested the outcome of the Iranian presidential election.\n\nOn the night of June 12, 2009, early election returns showed Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad comfortably on his way to reelection. But Mousavi denounced the ballot counting as fraudulent and declared himself the winner, according to the Washington Post account at the time.\n\nHis supporters gathered in the streets of Tehran after midnight to celebrate his claim to victory until police dispersed them with tear gas, the Post wrote.\n\nPence, Jan. 3: In the wake of the demonstrations and the regime\u2019s brutal attempts to suppress them, President Barack Obama repeatedly failed to express America\u2019s solidarity with the Iranian protesters. As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I recognized the lack of action for what it was: an abdication of American leadership. The United States has long stood with those who yearn for freedom and a brighter future, and yet the president declined to stand with a proud people who sought to escape from under the heavy weight of a dictatorship, issuing only a delayed response condemning the regime\u2019s violence.\n\nInitially, the Obama administration \u2014 which was hoping to begin negotiations with Iran on a nuclear weapons deal \u2014 took a wait-and-see approach to reports of election fraud.\n\nIn a June 14, 2009, interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Vice President Joe Biden said the Obama administration would pursue nuclear talks with Iran, despite the contested election results.\n\n\u201cLook, talks with Iran are not a reward for good behavior,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThey\u2019re only a consequence if the president makes the judgment it\u2019s in the best interest of the United States of America, our national security interests, to talk with the Iranian regime. Our interests are the same before the election as after the election, and that is we want them to cease and desist from seeking a nuclear weapon and having one in its possession, and secondly to stop supporting terror.\u201d\n\nBiden also said he had his doubts about Ahmadinejad\u2019s claim that the election was \u201cfree and fair,\u201d but he said the Obama administration would take a wait-and-see approach. \u201cWe\u2019re going to withhold comment until we have a, you know, a thorough review of the whole process and how they react in the aftermath,\u201d Biden said.\n\nThe next day, then-House Republican Whip Eric Cantor criticized what he described as \u201cthe administration\u2019s silence.\u201d But that changed on the very day that Cantor made his critical remarks.\n\nEven though the protests started on June 13, 2009, the Associated Press said \u201cthe worst violence since the disputed election\u201d occurred on June 15, 2009. The AP initially reported that one person died, but later reports put the number of dead at 12. It was on this day that Obama first addressed the protests.\n\nAt a joint press availability with the prime minister of Italy, Obama was asked whether the violence would affect his willingness to negotiate with Iran and what message he had for the protesters.\n\nObama, June 15, 2009: I want to start off by being very clear that it is up to Iranians to make decisions about who Iran\u2019s leaders will be; that we respect Iranian sovereignty and want to avoid the United States being the issue inside of Iran, which sometimes the United States can be a handy political football \u2014 or discussions with the United States. Having said all that, I am deeply troubled by the violence that I\u2019ve been seeing on television. I think that the democratic process \u2014 free speech, the ability of people to peacefully dissent \u2014 all those are universal values and need to be respected. And whenever I see violence perpetrated on people who are peacefully dissenting, and whenever the American people see that, I think they\u2019re, rightfully, troubled.\n\nFive days later, on June 20, 2009, Obama issued a statement that CNN described as his \u201cstrongest to date on the Iran situation.\u201d Obama\u2019s statement, in part, read: \u201cThe Iranian government must understand that the world is watching. We mourn each and every innocent life that is lost. We call on the Iranian government to stop all violent and unjust actions against its own people. The universal rights to assembly and free speech must be respected, and the United States stands with all who seek to exercise those rights.\u201d\n\nOn June 23, Obama stepped up his criticism of Iran, starting a White House press conference by strongly condemning the violence against protesters.\n\n\u201cThe United States and the international community have been appalled and outraged by the threats, the beatings and imprisonments of the last few days,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI strongly condemn these unjust actions, and I join with the American people in mourning each and every innocent life that is lost.\u201d\n\nA month later, the Iranian government said that 30 people had died, although the Guardian reported that at least 80 people had died.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Obama was criticized for not making an earlier or a more forceful statement, and readers can judge for themselves whether Obama\u2019s statements were appropriate or sufficient. But Pence is wrong to say the former president \u201crepeatedly failed\u201d to express solidarity with the Iranian protesters.", "lang": "en"}
