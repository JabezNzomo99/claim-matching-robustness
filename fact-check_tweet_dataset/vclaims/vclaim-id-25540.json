The claim is false; the picture is a screengrab from an animated GIF which was originally posted as satire.\n\n\n\nThe post was published here on August 8, 2019 and shows Drilon with his eyes closed and his mouth open with an out of focus view of the Philippine Senate plenary hall in the background.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nWhen translated to English, the caption says: \u201cHEY WAKE UP PORKY PIGGY\u2026 WHEN YOU'VE WOKEN UP THE DEATH PENALTY MAY HAVE ALREADY BEEN PASSED AND BY THEN YOU'VE FAILED TO STATE YOUR OBJECTION\u2026 YOU'LL EITHER END UP AS LECHON IN CHAIR OR LECHON IN BED.\u201d\n\nDrilon, who was re-elected to the Senate in 2016, is a member of the opposition Liberal Party.\n\nPorky is a slur used against him by his critics.\n\nCapital punishment was outlawed in the Philippines in 1987, reinstated in 1993 and abolished again in 2006.\n\nSince mid-term elections in May 2019, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has urged Congress to bring the death penalty back, according to this AFP report.\n\nVarious senators have introduced bills seeking the restoration of capital punishment since Congress resumed on July 22, as seen here, here, here and here.\n\nA Google reverse image search traced the image in the misleading post to a five second animated graphic interchange format (GIF) file on image hosting website Gfycat. The uncropped version of the image reveals a disclaimer that marks the GIF as \u201cpolitical satire\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the gif site:\n\nThe GIF also shows a logo with the words \u201cAng Malayang Pilipino\u201d (in English, \u201cThe Free Filipino\u201d).\n\nA search of \u201cAng Malayang Pilipino\u201d on social media led to this Facebook post.\n\nThe animated image hosted on Gfycat was excerpted from a 5:54 video purporting to show Drilon sleeping in the Senate chamber, accompanied by sound effects to give the impression that the senator was snoring.\n\nThe video was posted on November 19, 2018 -- more than eight months before Senate hearings on the death penalty began.\n\nThe post's caption, which contains three clear disclaimers that the content is satirical, says in part: \"Senate Inquiry In Aid Of Legislation - Investigation on Duterte's Power Naps. (disclaimer: this is a political satire.)\"\n\nBelow is an embedded copy of the post:\n\nNumerous comments on the satirical post indicated that despite the disclaimers, at least some viewers believed the video was real:\n\nWhen translated into English, this one reads: \u201cOH NO OH NO HE'S SLEEPING AGAIN\u2026JUST GRILL HIM INTO A LECHON\u201d", "lang": "en"}
