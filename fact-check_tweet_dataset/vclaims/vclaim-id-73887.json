Kamala Harris, D-Calif., whom presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden named as his vice-presidential running mate.\n\nShortly after Biden named Harris as his running mate on Aug. 11, the president\u2019s reelection campaign denounced her as \u201cphony Kamala,\u201d claiming she was willing to \u201cabandon her own morals, as well as try to bury her record as a prosecutor, in order to appease the anti-police extremists controlling the Democrat party.\u201d\n\nIn an email sent to supporters, the Trump campaign also labeled Harris \u201ca corrupt former California Attorney General\u201d:\n\nPaul Begala, a former advisor to former President Bill Clinton, alluded to a degree of irony in this allegation, claiming in a tweet that \u201cTrump donated to Kamala Harris when she was [attorney general].\u201d\n\nIn widely shared tweets, NBC News correspondent Tom Winter claimed that Trump had twice contributed to Harris\u2019 election campaign, in 2011 and 2013, donating a total of $6,000. Winter also said that Trump\u2019s daughter and advisor Ivanka Trump had herself donated $2,000 to Harris\u2019 campaign in 2014:\n\nThose claims were accurate. Records available through the campaign finance database on the website of the California secretary of state show that Trump made two contributions to Harris\u2019 2014 campaign for reelection as California attorney general: a $5,000 donation on Sep. 26, 2011, and a $1,000 donation on Feb. 20, 2013. Harris first took office in January 2011, which means Trump contributed to her reelection when she had already been in office for eight months, and two years, respectively.\n\nIn March 2019, The Sacramento Bee reported that a spokesperson for Harris\u2019 presidential primary campaign had said she \u201cdonated the $6,000 Trump had contributed to a non-profit that advocates for civil and human rights for Central Americans,\u201d with the newspaper adding that Harris\u2019 donation of the money took place in 2015.\n\nWe contacted spokespeople for both Harris and Biden, requesting further details about that claim, including the name of the charity in question, and the date on which Harris purportedly donated $6,000 to the charity. We did not receive a response in time for publication.\n\nThe campaign finance database also reveals that the future president made several other campaign contributions in California, to both Republicans and Democrats. He donated $2,500 to the unsuccessful 2010 gubernatorial campaign of Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who was ultimately elected to that office in 2019; he gave a total of $3,500 to Democrat Jerry Brown\u2019s successful 2006 bid to become California attorney general; he donated a total of $12,000 to committees supportive of Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger; and gave $25,000 to the state\u2019s Republican party, in 2005.\n\nThe database also corroborates Winter\u2019s claim that in June 2014, Ivanka Trump \u2014 adviser to, and daughter of, the president \u2014 herself made a $2,000 donation to Harris\u2019 successful campaign to be reelected as the state\u2019s attorney general. She also contributed $500 to the unsuccessful 2010 gubernatorial campaign of Newsom:", "lang": "en"}
