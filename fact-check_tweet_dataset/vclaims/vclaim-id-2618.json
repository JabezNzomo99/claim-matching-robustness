This funding will also be used to help keep children safe in France\u201d.\n\nThe Home Secretary also clarified that around \u00a314 million of this money is for security around the Calais port.\n\nJuxtaposed controls are the system of border security checks in place on French and Belgian soil to screen Britain-bound passengers before they enter the UK.\n\nBut what about the other \u00a380 million?\n\nThe \u00a380 million figure quoted by the Mail as the cost of security guards at French ports refers to money it says is \u201cpledged\u2026 to pay private security firms to patrol ports in northern France for three years.\u201d\n\nThis refers to an advertisement posted by the Home Office in July looking for a security contractor \u201cto support its operational activities in the Eurotunnel Terminal at Coquelles and the ports of Calais and Dunkerque [Dunkirk]\u201d.\n\nThe estimated value of this contract was put at \u00a380 million, excluding VAT, over three years.\n\nThe ad mentions vehicle and passenger searching, detention and \u201cescorting services\u201d as part of the job description. The advert also says that detention of individuals would last for no longer than three hours and only until the detainee could be handed over to Border Force officers.\n\nThe Home Office told us that this isn\u2019t directly related to the clearance of the Calais camp and associated security surrounding that. Instead it\u2019s the renewal of a longstanding security contract to police the area.\n\nIt also told us that \u00a380 million is the maximum value the contract could be worth, but it\u2019s expected to be significantly less than that.\n\nSo how much has this government contributed to support border security across the Channel?\n\nIn 2015/2016 the government contributed \u00a363 million to security around Calais and the Channel Tunnel. That included money for \u201cextra fencing and infrastructure, security guards, search dogs and detection technology.\u201d\n\nIn March it also announced another \u00a317 million would be spent on \u201cpriority security infrastructure in Calais and to move people from the camps in Calais to facilities elsewhere in France, and will fund joint work to return migrants not in need of protection to their home countries.\u201d\n\nOne example of infrastructure this funding covers is the wall being built at Calais which has been widely reported on.", "lang": "en"}
