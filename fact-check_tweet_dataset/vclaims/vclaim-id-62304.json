Alongside some of these protests, there have been instances of looting, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nFacebook users attempted to link a photo of people stealing goods from a store to the protests sparked by Floyd\u2019s death. One such post reads, \u201cLook at the pain and grief on all their faces as they mourn the tragic loss of George Floyd.\u201d\n\nBut the photo predates Floyd\u2019s death by several years. Photographer Jerry Jackson took the picture for the Baltimore Sun outside a CVS Pharmacy in Baltimore during protests after Freddie Gray died in April 2015 of a spinal cord injury incurred in police custody. The Baltimore Sun published the photo in a slideshow titled \u201c100 lasting images from the Freddie Gray protests and aftermath in Baltimore.\u201d\n\n\u201cLooters empty the CVS at Pennsylvania and North Ave during Monday\u2019s riot,\u201d reads the caption.
