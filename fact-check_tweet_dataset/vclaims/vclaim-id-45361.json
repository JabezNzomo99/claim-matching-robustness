Whitmer the Niece of George Soros?", "subtitle": "Conspiracy theorists continually add branches to the Soros family tree.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2020-06-09T21:36:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-45361", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/whitmer-the-niece-of-soros/", "vclaim": "In June 2020, a rumor started to circulate on social media that Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was the niece of billionaire George Soros:\n\nThe variations of this rumor that we encountered on social media were not accompanied by any evidence to prove this familial connection. In fact, these postings weren\u2019t typically accompanied by any information about how this alleged discovery was made, nor did they include any arguments (logical or otherwise) in support of this claim. These postings merely consisted of an unverified statement that was seemingly pulled out of thin air.\n\nThis rumor, of course, is a familiar one. Billionaire George Soros frequently plays the part of the \u201cboogeyman\u201d in far-right conspiracy theories (he has been falsely accused of owning a lab in Wuhan, China, of funding refugees to storm the border of the United States, and paying people to stage protests). In some circles, Soros\u2019 name has become so synonymous with nefarious activity that purveyors of misinformation can simply suggest that a person or organization has connections to Soros in order to stir up controversy.\n\nDuring the impeachment investigation into U.S. President Donald Trump in 2018, for example, a false rumor was circulated on social media claiming that Adam Schiff, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, was related to Soros through his sister\u2019s husband. This is not true. In 2016, as former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was running for president, a false rumor was circulated claiming that her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, was married to Soros\u2019 nephew. This, again, is not true.\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted in previous articles, Soros had one brother, Paul, who died in 2013 and is survived by two sons, Peter and Jeffrey Soros. Paul Soros had two other children, but they both died in infancy. George Soros has no nieces, which makes this claim about Whitmer false on its face.\n\nOut of an abundance of caution, however, we reached out to Whitmer for comment. A spokesperson simply told us: \u201cThe governor is not George Soros\u2019 niece.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
