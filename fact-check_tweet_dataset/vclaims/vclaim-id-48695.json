The claim is false; the local health authority told AFP the pilot is not pictured in the photo; the man wrongly identified in the posts denied the claim.\n\nThe photo, showing a man standing among dozens circled in blue, was published here on Facebook on March 17, 2020. It has been shared more than 620 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe Sinhala-language text above the image translates to English as: \u201cApologies about having to put up this pic\u2026 Here is the airport officer who was found to be testing positive for corona infection yesterday, at last week\u2019s big match\u2026 All those in this picture, please think of the country and go into quarantine...plz\u2026 This is the #thomians big match\u2026\u201d\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s flag carrier SriLankan Airlines on March 16 announced in this statement that one of its pilots tested positive for coronavirus. Local newspaper reports that followed, including this by The Sunday Morning and this by the Colombo Gazette, placed him at an annual cricket match.\n\nCOVID-19 has killed more than 9,800 and infected 232,650 others as of March 20, according to this AFP report. It was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019.\n\nThe photo also circulated alongside similar claims on Facebook here, here, here, here and here.\n\nBut the claim is false.\n\nDr. Ashan Pathirana, the registrar at the state-run Health Promotion Bureau, told AFP via Whatsapp Messenger on March 18 that \u201cthe individual in the image is not [the pilot who tested positive]\u201d.\n\nThe man circled in blue in the misleading photo, Gayan Nagasena, also published a Facebook post on March 17 saying he had been wrongly identified.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of his Facebook post:\n\nThe post reads, in part: \u201cThere is a picture circulating on social media marking me as First officer Ranabahu who is not even in the picture. Please refrain from sharing it and already its going viral and I am getting a lot of calls over this.\u201d\n\nDuring a phone conversation with AFP on March 20, Naaga confirmed he is not a pilot and in fact works as an executive at a Spanish firm operating in Sri Lanka.", "lang": "en"}
