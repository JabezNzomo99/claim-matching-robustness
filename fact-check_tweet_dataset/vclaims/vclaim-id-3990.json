Bush eventually did die at the age of 94 on December 1, 2018.\n\nIs former President George H.W. Bush dead again at 93? Nope, that's just a repeat from an older hoax run by a Ghana-based fake news network that was recently shut down after an investigation by Lead Stories. The new version of the hoax comes from an American site set up to troll conservatives and Republicans with false stories so they can be made fun of when they believe and share them.\n\nThe new version of the hoax appeared in an article published on April 28, 2018 on Daily World Update and titled \"George H.W. Bush Dead at 93\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nIt took less than a week for the loss of his soulmate and wife of 75 years to steal George H.W. Bush's will to live. Reports from Naranthan Timonson-Smith Medical Center in Houston are coming in from low-level interns and morgue workers that the Secret Service is guarding a body draped in an American flag in the basement of the hospital. Bush had been in intensive care for an infection before his death, which we estimate to be at 10:15 PM Eastern.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail and might have taken the news for real:\n\nBut there is no Naranthan Timonson-Smith Medical Center in Houston or anywhere else for that matter and Daily World Update comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nsat\u00b7ire ~\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nthe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, OR ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.\n\nIf you disagree with the definition of satire or have decided it is synonymous with \"comedy,\" you should really just move along.\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including potatriotpost.us, dailyworldupdate.us and nofakenewsonline.us. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nWe wrote about dailyworldupdate.us before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Cohen NOT Charged With Collusion And Treason\n\u2022 Fake News: Muslim Bar Owner Did NOT Shoot And Kill 2 Christians", "lang": "en"}
