It shows her saying the U.S. \u201cwill attack Iran\u201d if she becomes president. But she was responding to a question about a hypothetical nuclear attack by Iran on Israel.\n\nAs a presidential candidate in 2008, then-Sen. Hillary Clinton took a hardline approach against Iran and its nuclear weapons ambitions during an interview with journalist Chris Cuomo, who at the time was with ABC News.\n\nBut amid the current conflict between the U.S. and Iran, a clip from that 12-year-old video is circulating on Facebook without context for Clinton\u2019s words.\n\nThe clip, posted by multiple accounts and spliced in different ways, begins with Clinton asserting, \u201cIf I\u2019m the president, we will attack Iran.\u201d\n\nIn reality, Clinton was responding to a question about how she would respond to an Iranian nuclear attack on Israel, a U.S. ally, as other videos and a report from ABC News at the time show.\n\nABC News, April 22, 2008: In an interview with ABC\u2019s Chris Cuomo, Clinton expressed her toughest stance yet on Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and the potential threat the country poses to American allies. \u201cIf Iran were to launch a nuclear attack on Israel what would our response be?\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI want the Iranians to know that if I\u2019m the president, we will attack Iran. That\u2019s what we will do. There is no safe haven.\u201d \u201cWhatever stage of development they might be in their nuclear weapons program in the next 10 years during which they may foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel, we would be able to totally obliterate them,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nThe clip circulating now omits the part where Clinton says, \u201cIf Iran were to launch a nuclear attack on Israel what would our response be?\u201d\n\nIn one altered version, Clinton\u2019s out-of-context line \u2014 \u201cIf I\u2019m the president, we will attack Iran\u201d \u2014 is repeated at the end of the video, and illustrated with footage of a nuclear explosion.\n\nClinton no doubt viewed the prospect of U.S. military force as a useful deterrent for Iran, but the selective clip leaves the impression that she had plans to attack Iran irrespective of the country\u2019s actions.\n\nClinton\u2019s approach in 2008 presented a contrast with her then-rival for the Democratic nomination, Barack Obama, who likened her statements to \u201clanguage reflective of George Bush.\u201d But after Obama became president, Clinton served as his secretary of state and later (after leaving the administration) endorsed the Iran nuclear deal. That deal, intended to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities, was reached in 2015 by the U.S. and several other countries.\n\nStill, Clinton remained distrustful and critical of Iran as she mounted another presidential run \u2014 saying in a 2015 speech that she would \u201cdistrust and verify\u201d that Iran was living up to its obligations under the nuclear agreement. She continued to cite military action as an option, if necessary: \u201cAs president, I will take whatever actions are necessary to protect the United States and our allies. I will not hesitate to take military action if Iran attempts to obtain a nuclear weapon.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
