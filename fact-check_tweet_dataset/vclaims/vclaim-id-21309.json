Scott Walker made a claim about tax cuts since he took office in 2011.\n\nHe said the cuts that had been approved, and those that were proposed in his 2017-\u201919 state budget, would \"exceed $8 billion by the time the budget is done.\"\n\nNow the budget is done and Walker is making the claim without qualifications. For example, he declared on May 31, 2018, on Twitter:\n\n\"Since taking office, we have enacted more than $8 billion in cumulative tax relief.\"\n\nCampaigning for a third term in the November 2018 election, it\u2019s a statement Walker will repeat.\n\nLet\u2019s see if it\u2019s right.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office provided us tallies from the State Budget Office. They show that through June 2019, when the current 2017-\u201919 state budget ends, the tax cuts will exceed $8.85 billion.\n\nWe also went to a nonpartisan source, the state Legislative Fiscal Bureau, which did calculations in May 2018 and arrived at a slightly lower figure.\n\nThe fiscal bureau told us it estimated the reduction in general fund tax revenues and property tax revenues, as a result of tax law changes enacted since 2011, at $8.47 billion:\n\nWe asked the state Democratic Party about Walker\u2019s claim. The party did not challenge the $8 billion tally, but criticized a number of Walker\u2019s policies.\n\u2022 State tax cuts adopted since 2011 have disproportionately gone to Wisconsin residents with the highest incomes, according to an analysis by the nonprofit Wisconsin Budget Project.\n\u2022 The manufacturing and agricultural tax credit gave an estimated $22 million in credits to 11 individuals who had an adjusted gross income of $30 million or more in 2017, according to the state fiscal bureau.\n\nWalker says: \"Since taking office, we have enacted more than $8 billion in cumulative tax relief.\"\n\nThe state\u2019s official nonpartisan budget scorekeeper puts the figure -- since Walker took office in 2011 and through the current budget that runs through mid-2019 -- at $8.47 billion.", "lang": "en"}
