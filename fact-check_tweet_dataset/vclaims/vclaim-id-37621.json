Then we go and see the coastal elite media trashing it for not being organic vegan,\u201d the bogus quote reads. \u201cWe\u2019re football players, not bloggers. This was a perfect blue collar party.\u201d\n\nUsing his verified Twitter account, Lawrence reshared a now-deleted tweet of the meme and added: \u201cI never said this by the way\u2026 I don\u2019t know where it came from.\u201d\n\nThe university\u2019s assistant athletic director for football communications, Ross Taylor, confirmed in an email to FactCheck.org that \u201cTrevor did not say the quote.\u201d\n\nThe Twitter user who shared the meme that Lawrence responded to later conceded the quote was false. \u201cI made a mistake,\u201d the user tweeted. \u201cSomeone sent me the meme. I didn\u2019t fact check. That\u2019s on me.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nLawrence, Trevor (@Trevorlawrencee). \u201cI never said this by the way\u2026 I don\u2019t know where it came from. However the trip to the White House was awesome!\u201d Twitter. 15 Jan 2019.\n\n\u201cRemarks by President Trump Welcoming the 2018 College Football Playoff National Champion Clemson Tigers to the White House.\u201d WhiteHouse.gov. 15 Jan 2019.\n\nTaylor, Ross.
