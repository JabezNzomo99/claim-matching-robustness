The claim is false; the photo actually shows a rally held in Turkey in June 2018 and was taken by international news agency Reuters.\n\nThis Facebook post, shared dozens of times since it was published April 8, 2019, contains a photo showing a sea of people, many of them wearing red clothes, standing in a huge field. A big stage can also be seen to the left of the image.\n\nThe post claims that the photo is of a rally in the western Indonesian city of Batam organised by Widodo, who is running for re-election in national polls on April 17. Here is the president\u2019s official Twitter account.\n\nTranslated to English, the post\u2019s Indonesian-language caption says: \u201cThe campaign of Jokowi in Batam was lively\u2026 awesome,\u201d referring to Widodo by his nickname Jokowi.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the false Facebook post:\n\nA reverse image search on Google reveals the photo was not taken at an Indonesian election rally. It actually shows an election rally in Turkey held on June 23, 2018, by a presidential candidate named Muharrem Ince from the opposition Republican People\u2019s Party (CHP).\n\nThe photo was published by Reuters in this report on the day the rally took place.\n\nThe caption on the Reuters website says: \u201cMuharrem Ince, presidential candidate of Turkey\u2019s main opposition Republican People\u2019s Party (CHP), addresses his supporters during an election rally in Istanbul, Turkey June 23, 2018.\u201d\n\nThe composite images below compares the false Facebook post with the Reuters image as it appears on the news agency\u2019s website:\n\nAn AFP photographer was also at the rally in Istanbul and took similar photos of the same crowd, for example this one.\n\nThe caption of the AFP photo says: \u201cSupporters of Muharrem Ince, presidential candidate of Turkey's main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), take part in an election rally in Istanbul on June 23, 2018.\u201d\n\nBelow is the AFP image, in which the same red-adorned metal structures, white balloons and trees in the background can be seen:\n\nWhen the image is examined more closely, people in the crowd can be seen waving Turkish flags and there is a poster for Ince in the top left-hand corner.\n\nThese details are clearly visible in the two zoomed-in sections of the AFP photo featured in the image below:\n\nWidodo did hold a campaign rally in Batam on April 6, 2019. Here is a report by Indonesian news outlet Detik which includes several photos of the event.\n\nThe president\u2019s supporters are waving red and white flags, but no red metal structures are visible and there is a podium that does not appear in the Reuters or AFP images.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Detik report:", "lang": "en"}
