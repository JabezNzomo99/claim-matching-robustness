{"title": "Are Black Lives Matter Members Poisoning Fast Food?", "subtitle": "Can you smell the copypasta rumors?", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2020-06-25T12:09:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-60376", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/black-lives-matter-fast-food/", "vclaim": "Black Lives Matter \"members and supporters\" are tampering with or poisoning the orders of white patrons at fast food restaurants.\n\nIn late June 2020, a meme shared on Facebook prompted Snopes readers to ask if \u201cmembers and supporters\u201d of the Black Lives Matter movement were tampering with white people\u2019s fast food orders:\n\nThe meme was an example of \u201ccopypasta,\u201d defined by Dictionary.com as \u201ca block of text which is repeatedly copied and pasted by individuals over various online forums and social media sites.\u201d\n\nThe underlying assumptions the meme makes are problematic. For starters, the idea that there is a \u201cnationwide conspiracy\u201d to poison fast food orders would no doubt lead in the news, but as of this writing there were no news reports of any such widespread public health crisis. The claim in the meme is nothing more than a baseless rumor with no evidence offered. And Black Lives Matter is a national movement for social justice, not a membership-based organization, and activists who support it seek social equality and institutional reforms, not to cause physical harm to white people.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time a false rumor about poisoned food circulated in the wake of Black Lives Matter demonstrations in 2020. A New York police union claimed that officers had been poisoned at a Shake Shack, but a police investigation found no criminal activity.\n\nBecause this meme is a copy-and-pasted rumor with no evidence to support it, we rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
