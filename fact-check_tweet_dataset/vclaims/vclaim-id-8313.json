Lending his support to that movement (even though he was once squarely on the opposite site of that issue), the president told the audience that he was committed to building \u201ca society where life is celebrated, protected and cherished.\u201d\n\nThe president raised some eyebrows, however, when he proclaimed that \u201cRight now, a number of state laws allow a baby to be born from his or her mother\u2019s womb in the ninth month. It is wrong. It has to change:\n\nThat remark quickly became the subject of mocking social media memes:\n\nTrump\u2019s statement was eyebrow-raising because the ninth month is when one typically expects a child to be born (the average human gestation period being 280 days).\n\nOf course, President Trump likely simply misspoke and said \u201cborn\u201d rather than \u201ctorn,\u201d intending for his statement to decry late-term abortions, as he did elsewhere in his address when he voiced support for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, saying: \u201cI strongly supported the House of Representatives\u2019 pain-capable bill, which would end painful late-term abortions nationwide, and I call upon the Senate to pass this important law and send it to my desk for signing.\u201d\n\nTrump similarly condemned \u201crip[ping] the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby\u201d during the 2016 presidential debates:", "lang": "en"}
