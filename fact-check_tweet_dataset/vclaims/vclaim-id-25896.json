Police fired tear gas shells and water cannons as protesters tried to break barricades and enter the capital. The protests are part of the \"Kisan Kranti Padyatra\" to demand loan waivers, subsidized electricity and fuel and pension for farmers over the age of 60. The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) called off the protest after authorities allowed farmers to proceed to Rajghat post-midnight.", "lang": "en"}
