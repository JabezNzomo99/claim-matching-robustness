But it is misleading to compare one\u2019s average GDP growth rate in three years, to the growth rate achieved by another in a single year.\n\n\u201cHaving sense in the NPP means implementing policies which, according to the latest Ghana Living Standards Survey, has resulted in a decline in unemployment rates from 11.9% in 2015 to 7.3% in 2019.\u201d\n\nThe Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS) was neither conducted in 2015 nor in 2019. Therefore, the President\u2019s claim on unemployment is false.\n\nThe survey which began in 1987 is conducted every five years, and the last two editions were in 2012/13 and 2016/17, according to the Ghana Statistical Service.\n\n\u201cWe conduct the survey every five years but sometimes it exceeds the stipulated period. After the 6th edition (2012/13), we gathered data in late 2016 which formed the basis for the 2017 report,\u201d Acting Director of Communication and Dissemination at the Ghana Statistical Service Johnson Owusu Kagya told GhanaFact.\n\nPer the GSLL report for 2017, the unemployment rate was 8.4% for the period spanning 2012/13 and 2016/17.\n\nThe unemployment rate for the previous edition (2012/13) was 5.2%.\n\nThe Ghana Living Standards Survey is a World Bank programme (implemented by Ghana Statistical Service) that measures income levels, expenditure patterns and poverty trends to generate data for governments of participating countries to guide policy formulation.\n\nClaim one is rated mixture because it is a mix of accurate and inaccurate content, while claim two is rated false.", "lang": "en"}
