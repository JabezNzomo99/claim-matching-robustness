Now who will get the temple made? Disappointed (translated).\u201d At the time of writing this article, the post attracted over 3,500 shares and 4,000 likes.\n\nA website India Time 24 published an article along similar lines. It was titled \u2013 \u201c\u0938\u0902\u092c\u093f\u0924 \u092a\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u091b\u0941\u091f\u094d\u091f\u0940, \u0905\u092c \u0907\u0938 \u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0935 \u092e\u0902\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u092c\u0928\u093e\u092f\u093e \u092d\u093e\u091c\u092a\u093e \u0915\u093e \u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092f \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093e (Sambit Patra was let go, now this former minister is made the national spokesperson for BJP).\u201d The article claimed that the decision was taken after BJP\u2019s loss in the recent assembly elections and the person chosen for the position was BJP MP Rajeev Pratap Rudy.\n\nA correspondent of Go News 24X7 also made a similar claim, suggesting that Patra will not be addressing BJP press briefings. His tweet attracted over 400 likes and 1,000 retweets.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nThe claims floating on social media about Samit Patra\u2019s dismissal are false. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) website lists his name as one of the 10 official spokespersons for the party.\n\nRajeev Pratap Rudy, a former union minister, has been appointed as a new spokesperson for the BJP and has no consequence to Patra\u2019s position in the party.\n\nAlt News also spoke with Patra who confirmed to us that he continues to work with the BJP in the same capacity.\n\nSamit Patra has often found himself in the crosshairs of misinformation, both being a target and a purveyor.", "lang": "en"}
