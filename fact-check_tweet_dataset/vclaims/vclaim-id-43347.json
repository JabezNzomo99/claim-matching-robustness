The post is misleading; the image of the stocked shelves is a screenshot from US news footage shot this year, not in 2009.\n\n\"2009: H1N1 Virus,\" reads the text on the first photo, showing full supplies. \"2020: COVID19,\" says the text on the photo of empty shelves.\n\nText at the bottom reads: \"Still Think The Media Doesn't Control You?\" The misleading posts date to at least March 15, 2020.\n\nScreenshot of the misleading Facebook post taken March 24, 2020\n\nThe meme was shared more than 2,000 times on Facebook, including here, here, and here.
