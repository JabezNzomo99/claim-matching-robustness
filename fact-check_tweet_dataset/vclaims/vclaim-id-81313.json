Rand Paul (R-Ky.) claims there was \"no plane\" for Special Ops forces during the Benghazi incident. That's wrong.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2015-03-11T18:44:30Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-81313", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/05/28/rand-pauls-claim-there-was-no-plane-for-special-ops-forces-in-benghazi/", "vclaim": "This conversation was prompted by an ABC News report last week concerning a White House e-mail that was sent to YouTube at 9:11 p.m. Eastern time on Sept. 11, 2012, during the first of a series of attacks that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans. While the White House communication to YouTube concerning an anti-Islamic video had been previously reported, during the week of the attacks, the timing of the e-mail struck some analysts as curious, given that internally some U.S. officials were already convinced that the diplomatic post in Benghazi was the target of a terrorist attack.\n\nFor instance, the day after the attack on the diplomatic post, The Washington Post reported that the attackers \u201cjoined protesters outside the consulate who were demonstrating against an American movie that they believed denigrated the prophet Muhammad. But according to one witness, the new arrivals neither chanted slogans nor carried banners.\u201d Who was one of the sources? Wanis al-Sharif, the deputy Libyan interior minister.\n\nBut after exhaustive investigation, it now appears the attacks took place without any initial protests. The link to the video is tangential. \u201cSome intelligence suggests the attacks were likely put together in short order, following that day\u2019s violent protests in Cairo against an inflammatory video, suggesting that these and other terrorist groups could conduct similar attacks with little advance warning,\u201d said a bipartisan report of the Senate Intelligence Committee issued in January.\n\nIn any case, Paul\u2019s comments are noteworthy because he asserted that the White House \u201ccouldn\u2019t find a plane\u201d for Special Operations forces. \u201cInstead of calling to get a plane or to try to make arrangements to get a plane, they\u2019re on the phone trying to create spin to say that, \u2018You know what? This is about a video, which never had anything to do with this attack,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nDEFENSE SECRETARY LEON PANETTA: \u201cSoon after the initial reports about the attack in Benghazi were received, General Dempsey and I met with President Obama and he ordered all available DOD assets to respond to the attack in Libya and to protect U.S. personnel and interests in the region. It\u2019s important to remember that in addition to responding to the situation in Benghazi, we were also concerned about potential threats to U.S. personnel in Tunis, Tripoli, Cairo, Sana\u2019a, and elsewhere that could potentially require a military response. In consultation with General Dempsey and AFRICOM Commander General Ham, I directed several specific actions. First, we ordered a Marine fleet anti-terrorism secure team, a FAST team, stationed in Spain to prepare to deploy to Benghazi. A second FAST platoon was ordered to prepare to deploy to the embassy in Tripoli. A special operations force, which was training in central Europe, was ordered to prepare to deploy to an intermediate staging base in southern Europe, Sigonella. And a special operations force based in the United States was ordered to deploy to an intermediate staging base in southern Europe as well at Sigonella.\u201d\n\nThe White House obviously has a large staff \u2014 and the Defense Department, the State Department and the intelligence community are vast and sprawling. Clearly many people were involved in analyzing the situation and then trying to coordinate a response. Aircraft and troops were dispatched by the appropriate personnel \u2014 at the Defense Department \u2014 even as someone at the White House sent an e-mail to YouTube.\n\nAs for whether or not there was plane, the Majority Interim Report of the House Armed Services Committee, issued in February, makes it clear that there was not a shortage of aircraft for Special Ops forces. (There is a separate issue about whether there were combat aircraft or whether personnel were correctly deployed to deal with such an emergency.) Here are key excerpts:\n\nThere are certainly a number of outstanding questions about the Benghazi incident, but it\u2019s important to get the facts straight when asking such questions. Paul asserted that a plane could not be found for Special Operations forces in Tripoli, but that\u2019s clearly incorrect. Moreover, it\u2019s a bit ridiculous to assume that such a level of detail would be left to White House staff, or even the president, rather than the commanders on the ground. (For more fact checks on Benghazi, check out our comprehensive round-up.)\n\nUpdate, 4:30 PM, May 28: The Rand Paul aide responded with a lengthy statement, which we reprint below. Based on the information provided, The Fact Checker sees no reason to adjust the Pinocchio rating. As a reminder, here is what Paul said: \u201cWe had some more Special Operations forces in Tripoli. They couldn\u2019t find a plane for them. So instead of calling to get a plane or to try to make arrangements to get a plane, they\u2019re on the phone trying to create spin.\u201d\n\u2022 None There was literally no American plane available to transport troops. First six guys went on Libyan plane\n\u2022 None There are reports that negotiating for the first Libyan plane to take the first six out of Benghazi took time. Had Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department approved the DC-3 airplane request on May 3, 2012 this likely would not have happened. According to a spokesman for the House Oversight Committee, the documents provided to the Committee multiple security requests were \u201cturned down by Washington based officials.\u201d This speaks to the idea that the State Department and the Obama Administration did not prepare for the situation at hand. Furthermore, you state that \u201cthere is a separate issue about whether there were combat aircraft or whether personnel were correctly deployed to deal with such an emergency.\u201d That is the central issue, not a separate issue.\n\u2022 None There are reports from the House Oversight Committee that Lt. Col. Gibson did have difficulty negotiating for another \u201cLibyan\u201d plane to take the next special ops team. Interestingly, the plane was a C-130, an American plane likely given or sold to Libyans, but for which we had to beg to use in an emergency.\n\u2022 None Lt. Col. Gibson did complain in his testimony about not being allowed to go to Benghazi with second contingent of special ops. His exact term was that he was \u201cvisibly upset\u201d at the time. [Note from The Fact Checker: As stated above, Gibson said the decision was correct in hindsight.]\n\u2022 None The point you miss is this one. From CBS News, \u201cno assistance arrived from the U.S. military outside of Libya during the hours that Americans were under attack or trapped inside compounds by hostile forces armed with rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and AK-47 rifles. That is the central point.", "lang": "en"}
