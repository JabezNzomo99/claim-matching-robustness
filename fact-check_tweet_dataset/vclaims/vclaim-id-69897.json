Andy Barr of doing just that.\n\nThe Republican is running for re-election in Kentucky\u2019s 6th Congressional District against Marine veteran Amy McGrath.\n\nThe DCCC launched the ad \"Doing Right\" on Oct. 8, and it accuses Barr of brushing off the significance of military service. The ad ran from Oct. 9 to Oct. 15.\n\nAfter criticizing Barr for allegedly giving tax breaks to corporations, the ad says Barr was \"even dismissing the importance of military service\" while onscreen text displays a quote from him that reads: \"We both served our country. I\u2019ve served in a position where ideas matter.\"\n\nSo did Barr actually dismiss military service when compared with serving in political office? Not exactly.\n\nWhat Barr said in context\n\nThe DCCC\u2019s ad cites an article from the Louisville Courier Journal, which references an interview Barr gave to the New York Times.\n\nAt one point, Barr seems to compare his political experience in government with McGrath\u2019s military service.\n\nThe DCCC ad ends his quote with Barr saying that he\u2019s \"served in a position where ideas matter.\"\n\nBut, it isn\u2019t the complete quote: \"We both served our country. I\u2019ve served in a position where ideas matter. My opponent has served her country in the military, where execution matters.\"\n\nThe ad stops short of finishing Barr\u2019s quote and makes it look like he said something more damning \u2013 that political office experience is more important than serving in the military.\n\nBarr didn\u2019t say that, but he did compare the two.\n\nThe Barr campaign says that the charge is a lie and pointed to his work on behalf of veterans.\n\n\"A member of Congress serves his / her constituents,\" spokeswoman Jodi Whitaker said. \"They get people their Social Security checks, Medicare payments, veteran benefits.\"\n\nA DCCC ad says Barr is belittling military service while emphasizing the role of holding political office.\n\nBarr did compare military service with being a politician. But the ad doesn\u2019t present the full quote, making what Barr said appear to be much worse than it was.\n\nWe rate it Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
