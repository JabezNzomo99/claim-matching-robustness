The caption reads, \u201cDemonstrators use green laser lights to riot police officers during a protest against policies of Sebastian Pi\u00f1era and longstanding inequality on November 15, 2019 in Santiago, Chile.\u201d\n\nLasers have become an increasingly popular tool among protesters around the globe to distract or obstruct riot police, according to The Atlantic.
