However, the photo was taken in 2016 during a festival and no tanks were used to move troops throughout the Greater Toronto Area, army representatives told AFP.\n\n\u201cThis is happening Downtown Toronto apparently,\u201d a Facebook user wrote on April 6 alongside a photo showing a tank, flanked by three Canadian military officers in uniforms while civilians look on.\n\nThe photo is genuine and it was taken in Toronto, but not in 2020 and it is unrelated to the novel coronavirus.\n\n\u201cThis is not a current picture,\u201d Lieutenant Nadine Abou Rjeily, spokeswoman for the 4th Canadian Division told AFP by email, adding that the photo was taken almost four years ago during Toronto\u2019s Nuit Blanche, an all-night contemporary art event.\n\nA Google reverse image search confirms that the photo was published on the Canadian Armed Forces account on October 3, 2016, two days after Nuit Blanche took place. The 4th division\u2019s media team is credited for the photo. The Instagram account that the Facebook user claimed has video footage of the tank is private. The user refused to provide access to AFP.\n\nA search on Google Street View shows that the photo was taken on the eastern end of Dundas Square, on Victoria Street.\n\nResidents of the Greater Toronto Area were warned on April 5 that military vehicles and personnel would be circulating as troops head to Base Borden, approximately 100 kilometers north of Toronto. However, no tanks were involved.\n\n\u201cThere are no tanks deployed in the streets of Toronto and the vehicles being used to move the troops from the Greater Toronto Area and to CFB Borden are military logistics vehicles, buses, and civilian pattern passenger vehicles,\u201d Abou Rjeily told AFP.\n\nSome 550 military personnel from across Ontario had arrived at the base by April 6, where they formed a Territorial Battle Group \u201cready to support any request of assistance required,\u201d said Abou Rjeily.\n\nDaniel Lebouthillier, a spokesman for National Defence, lamented the publication of false information during the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cThe risks and impacts of misinformation during this critical period are real and need close and careful monitoring,\u201d he said by email.\n\nAFP Fact Check has investigated almost 300 false and misleading claims about the novel coronavirus.", "lang": "en"}
