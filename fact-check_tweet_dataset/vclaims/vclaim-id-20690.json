No, that's not exactly true: the claim was made by a website that habitually takes bits and pieces of real news and then adds some untruths to the headline and/or the first paragraph to make their articles more sensational in order to drive clicks. The headline and first paragraph are simply not real.\n\nThe claim originated from an article published by YourNewsWire on June 6, 2018 titled \"British School Boys Must Now Wear 'Gender-Neutral' Skirts\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nSchool boys in the United Kingdom are now banned from wearing shorts during the summer and are required to wear \"gender neutral\" skirts instead. A high school in Oxfordshire, England has become the first to implement the new policy, forcing boys to ditch their shorts in favor of skirts which school leaders say are \"more formal\" than shorts. Zerohedge.com reports: Unsurprisingly, parents are complaining about the bizarre school dress code, which is part of a larger trend of schools adopting \"gender neutral\" uniforms to make transgender students feel more at home.\n\nThe original Daily Mail article the story is based on only mentions one school, so it is definitely not the entire country:\n\nIn addition to that it only mentions that shorts weren't allowed before and they still aren't but because of various other rules and regulations pupils are allowed to wear skirts as not allowing them would presumably discriminate against girls and transgender students. So it sounds more like someone found a clever way to technically comply with the rules and still not have to wear trousers in hot weather. Nobody is being forced to wear skirts.\n\nYourNewsWire has published several hoaxes and fake news articles in the past so anything they write or publish should be taken with a large grain of salt. Their Facebook page \"The People's Voice\" recently lost its verification checkmark according to a report from MMFA.\n\nThe Terms of Use of the site also make it clear they don't really stand behind the accuracy of any of their reporting:\n\nThe site was profiled in the Hollywood reporter where it was described as:\n\nRationalWiki described it as:\n\nA while ago we also reported that YourNewsWire had rebranded itself as NewsPunch by changing its domain name in an apparent effort to evade filtering/blocking. It appears the site has changed back to it's old name in the mean time but you can still see the NewsPunch name in the contact email address in the footer.\n\nWe wrote about yournewswire.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Pope Francis Did NOT Order White Women To Breed With Muslims\n\u2022 Fake News: Trump NOT Set To Legalize Medical Marijuana In All 50 States\n\u2022 Fake News: CNN NOT Raided By FCC For Deceiving American Public\n\u2022 Fake News: 20 Priests Killed In Plane Crash NOT Connected To Vatican Pedophile Ring\n\u2022 Fake News: CNN NOT To Permanently Close Its Doors As Ratings Plunge 30 Percent", "lang": "en"}
