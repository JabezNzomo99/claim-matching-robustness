While the message was falsely attributed to Chinese government mouthpiece Global Times, there\u2019s no evidence to support its authenticity. It\u2019s pertinent to note, however, that the Global Times\u2019 editor-in-chief did confirm casualties on the Chinese side, but names and the number of casualties have not been released officially. Though, later in its bulletin, the news channel possibly noticed the faux pas and mentioned that the information could be a \u201cfake forward\u201d. The viral message mentions that the Global Times article was published on Wednesday at 0:57:25. \u201cA spokesperson for the Western Theatre Command that oversees defences of China's border with India has released the names of 30 Chinese troops killed by Indian action,\u201d the message adds. Several social media users have shared the message on Facebook and Twitter with the same claim. You can view the archived version here.

A search on the organisation\u2019s website also led to no results on the same. The news organisation has not shared any such information on its Twitter account as well. 2017 Video Passed Off as Deadly India-China Clash at Galwan Valley We searched on Google with some of the names mentioned in the viral message and found a Facebook post that carried a link to a website called chinanews.com along with the contents of the viral message. However, this link leads to the homepage of the website and not to any article. Meanwhile, Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of Global Times tweeted on Tuesday, 16 June, mentioning that the Chinese government has not released the official numbers of the casualties that took place in the incident. Chinese side didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t release number of PLA casualties in clash with Indian soldiers. My understanding is the Chinese side doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want people of the two countries to compare the casualties number so to avoid stoking public mood. This is goodwill from Beijing. \u2014 Hu Xijin \u00e8\u0083\u00a1\u00e9\u0094\u00a1\u00e8\u00bf\u009b (@HuXijin_GT) June 16, 2020 We also checked the archival history of the Twitter account of Global Times on archive.is and Wayback machine. The account had been archived once on Wednesday, 17 June on archive.is at 03:44 pm IST and once on the same day on Wayback machine at 07:43 am. However, none of the archived snapshots showed any such information being shared by the account. Although it should be noted that not every detail of every account gets archived on the web.\n\nThe information that was revealed about the number of casualties was also source-based and there is no official figure which has been announced. As expected, leaks now placing Indian casualties at 20 soldiers. And quickly govt's spin machine is giving out a Chinese casualty count of 43.\n\n\n\nThe cynical political calculation clearly is: If we can claim we killed 43 Chinese, killing of 20 Indian soldiers will matter far less \u2014 Ajai Shukla (@ajaishukla) June 16, 2020 Taylor Fravel, Director of MIT Security Studies Program (SSP), also took to Twitter to highlight how China doesn\u2019t own up and has a track record of hiding deaths. I can think of no armed conflict involving China where it has released casualty figures publicly at the time of the conflict. Usually, they are published years or decades later. Casualties from 1962 war only published in 1994 internal history. https://t.co/gMBg5povsW \u2014 M. Taylor Fravel (@fravel) June 16, 2020 Evidently, an unverified information is being circulated on social media to claim that Global Times released the list of 30 Chinese soldiers killed in Galwan valley.", "lang": "en"}
