The tweet claimed that the song was performed by US students as a show to thanks to India after Prime Minister Modi agreed to supply Hydrocholoquine (HCQ to the US. President Donald Trump has hyped HCQ, a medication for malaria, as a \u201cmiracle\u201d drug to prevent/ cure coronavirus infection. India had banned all export of the drug however agreed to release it after Trump threatened retaliation.\n\nThe claim that American students sang the Indian national anthem to thank the country for supplying HCQ is viral on social media.\n\nA simple YouTube search takes one to the video uploaded three years ago by YouTuber Anita Dixit whose screen name is Rickshawali. She is the one who first starts singing in the video.\n\n\u201cRicksters ! Happy Independence Day. On the occasion of our 71st Independence day, I wanted to celebrate global freedom and diversity. Unity and diversity is what India is all about and so is this video. Please stand up and let\u2019s celebrate different people from the world singing THE INDIAN NATIONAL ANTHEM,\u201d reads the description of the video uploaded on August 12, 2017.\n\nThe video was therefore uploaded by a YouTuber in 2017 on the occasion of the Indian independence day and has nothing to do with India supplying HCQ drug to the US. Earlier, an image of tricolour projected on Switzerland\u2019s Matterhorn mountain was also viral with the false claim that this was a show of thanks.", "lang": "en"}
