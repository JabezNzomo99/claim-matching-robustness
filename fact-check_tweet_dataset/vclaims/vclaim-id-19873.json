There were also 245,000 instances of short-term care provided.\n\nThe problem with social care is that it can be very expensive. And it\u2019s very hard to know who will need it. So the question is how much the unlucky ones who need it should pay, and how much the government should do to share the risk of these costs?\n\nEarlier this week the Prime Minister announced that there may be a cap on the total amount anyone receiving adult social care in England would have to pay for it.\n\nShe said \u201cthis manifesto says that we will come forward with a consultation paper, a government green paper. And that consultation will include an absolute limit on the amount people have to pay for their care costs... We will make sure there\u2019s an absolute limit on what people need to pay.\u201d\n\nThere are no details on what this cap might look like yet. The Coalition government legislated for a cap of \u00a372,000 in 2014, but this was delayed until at least 2020.\n\nLast week\u2019s Conservative manifesto contained other plans to change how people pay for adult social care in England. It proposed changing the means test for adult social care and when people need to pay for it.\n\nBefore this announcement of a cap, Sir Andrew Dilnot who chaired a review of social care in 2010/11, said that without a cap people facing costs for care would be \u201cleft helpless\u201d. He also said that \u201cwhat\u2019s being done on the means test will help some people but the majority of people who are getting care\u2014not in a residential care home but in their own homes\u2014will find themselves worse off\u201d.\n\nIf the changes set out in the manifesto go ahead, an estimated 12% to 17% of people in their 70s in England currently eligible for support would no longer be eligible, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.", "lang": "en"}
