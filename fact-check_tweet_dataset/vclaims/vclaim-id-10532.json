It\u2019s not entirely accurate to describe it simply as the cost to the economy, the NHS and society as a whole, as that misses out that about half of it\u2014\u00a354 billion\u2014is an estimate of the cost to individuals\u2019 quality of life as a result of having mental health difficulties.\n\nEstimates of this kind are always uncertain, and rest on a number of assumptions\u2014most notably in this case, regarding the monetary value of a healthy year of life.\n\nAbout half of the \u00a3105 billion refers to costs to individuals\n\nCMH\u2019s estimate, which refers to costs in England, is made up of the following:\n\nThis includes not only the cost of providing NHS and local authority health and social care services, but the cost of welfare benefits, and the cost of informal care provided by family and friends.\n\u2022 \u00a330.3 billion cost of the loss of output\n\nThis includes the cost of lost productivity due to sickness absence, lost productivity and working hours due to people with mental health problems not being in work, and lost productivity at home, such as housework.\n\nThis provides a monetary value for the cost of the reduction in people\u2019s quality of life caused by mental illness.\n\nThe figure depends on how you count the monetary value of intangible costs\n\nCMH said of its estimates when it first compiled them in 2003 that:\n\n\u201cThe provisional nature of these estimates should be emphasised, particularly in the case of human costs where the figures are based on assumptions and data sources which are very much open to improvement in future work.\u201d\n\nWhat value would you put on one year of healthy life? That\u2019s exactly the question that the researchers compiling these estimates had to get an answer to. In its earlier cost estimate put together by the charity back in 2003, CMH used a figure of \u00a330,000. This was uprated in line with inflation for its 2010 analysis.\n\nIt said there was reason to think this was a fair estimate, saying for example that it was the threshold used by health regulator the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to judge whether interventions were cost-effective, but it stressed the evidence behind it was \u201cfar from secure\u201d.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only type of intangible cost that the researchers have attempted to put a figure on.\n\nFor example, there\u2019s also unpaid support given by family and friends. CMH\u2019s earlier research discusses whether this should be valued at the same cost as residential care, or whether family and friends might incur greater costs. For instance, if they\u2019re not benefitting from the savings associated with providing a service at scale.\n\nProbably the biggest difficulty in calculating the cost of mental health problems is that we still don\u2019t really know how many people have mental health problems. People have different opinions of what\u2019s a mental health problem and what\u2019s not, and not everyone with mental health difficulties come into contact with relevant services.\n\nCMH points out it hasn\u2019t included all potential costs. For example, it excludes the costs of \u201cpresenteeism\u201d\u2014the losses in productivity from functioning at a lower capacity than usual due to health problems.", "lang": "en"}
