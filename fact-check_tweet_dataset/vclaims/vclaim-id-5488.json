The violence broke out after the event in San Jose wrapped up just before 8 p.m. local time (11 p.m. ET). Some Trump supporters were punched. One woman wearing a \u201cTrump\u201d jersey was cornered, spat on, and pelted with eggs and water bottles. Police held back at first but eventually moved in. San Jose Police Sgt. Enrique Garcia told NBC News that several protesters were arrested and one officer was assaulted in the melee.\n\nIn their reporting, numerous credible news outlets published a widely-reproduced photograph of a woman who had been pelted eggs during the protests in San Jose:\n\nA few days later, a separate image of a purported victim of violence that supposedly stemmed from a Trump campaign rally began circulating, but that picture was a still frame taken from a Mexican telenovela and was unrelated to any Trump rallies in San Jose.\n\nLikewise, the image of a bloodied blonde woman seen above is not in any way related to any Trump rally altercations, in San Jose or elsewhere. Multiple skeptical commenters pointed out that the bruised woman appeared calm and unruffled despite sustaining what appeared to be severe injuries, and a reverse image search immediately revealed that the photograph in question was published online as early as January 2016, six months prior to the June 2016 Trump rally in San Jose. A January 2016 article by the British Daily Mail newspaper reported that the individual depicted in the photograph was actress Samara Weaving, and the picture showed the application of makeup to her for the television program Ash vs. Evil Dead:\n\nShe was a fresh-faced beauty on Home and Away, but Samara Weaving [is] sporting a slightly different look. Appearing battered and bloodied, the 23-year-old shared a snap from the makeup chair on the set of Ash vs Evil Dead, a comedy horror show now in its second season. The Australian actress played the role of Heather in three episodes in the show\u2019s first season, with fans expressing how happy they were she was returning.", "lang": "en"}
