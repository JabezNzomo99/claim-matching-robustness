But he has said undocumented immigrants should be permitted to pay out-of-pocket for unsubsidized insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace.\n\nIn 2019, Biden said anyone who needs health care, \u201cwhether they\u2019re documented or undocumented, we have an obligation to see that they\u2019re cared for.\u201d So-called \"undocumented\" individuals already receive emergency care, treatment from federally-subsidized health centers, and varying degrees of coverage from states.\n\nIn June and July 2020, ahead of the presidential elections, Democratic candidate Joe Biden\u2019s various policy platforms were picked apart and in some cases misrepresented by critics, including U.S. President Donald Trump. One particular statement Biden made about health care for so-called \u201cundocumented\u201d immigrants was misreported and presented without context as his policy.\n\nSnopes readers asked us if Biden had ever said that U.S. taxpayers had an \u201cobligation\u201d to pay for the health care of 11 million \u201cillegal immigrants.\u201d We found that Biden was misquoted, and his actual platform said something very different.\n\nThe quote appeared to originate from a clip shared by right-wing media organization BlazeTV, in May 2019. The video carried the title, \u201cJoe Biden Says U.S. Obligated to Give Free Healthcare to \u2018Undocumented\u2019 Immigrants.\u201d\n\nIn the clip, a reporter asked Biden, \u201cDo you think the undocumented immigrants\u2026[that] are law abiding, should be entitled to federal benefits, Medicare, Medicaid for example?\u201d Biden responded:\n\n\u201cLook I think that anyone who is in a situation where they\u2019re in need of healthcare, regardless of whether they\u2019re documented or undocumented, we have an obligation to see that they\u2019re cared for. That\u2019s why I think we need more clinics around the country.\u201d\n\nBiden echoed this in the June 2019 Democratic presidential debates. And in a December 2019 interview with Telemundo, he laid out the caveats in his plan: \u201cThey can buy into the system like everyone else\u201d under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nOn July 14, 2020, in a rambling speech, Trump misrepresented Biden\u2019s policy after it was presented by the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Forces. Trump said: \u201cThey want government health care for all illegal aliens.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s what the task force actually recommended:\n\n\u201cTo ensure that people living and working across the country have health care access, the Task Force recommends extending Affordable Care Act coverage to DACA recipients, allowing undocumented immigrants to purchase unsubsidized coverage in the ACA marketplaces \u2026\u201d\n\nUnder this proposal, taxpayers would not be paying for undocumented immigrants\u2019 health care, rather undocumented immigrants could have the option to pay out-of-pocket for health coverage through the ACA exchange marketplace, but without access to the government subsidies that are available to others.\n\nIn 2019 Brookings estimated that there are 10.5 to 12 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. Currently, they cannot enroll in Medicaid, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), or purchase insurance through the ACA marketplace. Some state-funded or locally-funded health programs provide coverage regardless of immigration status. Emergency health services and safety-net clinics are already available to undocumented immigrants, which Biden had advocated for before.\n\nIn summary, even though Biden did state that the U.S. had an obligation to ensure immigrants received health care, his views were largely misrepresented and did not reflect his current policy. While he would extend health care access to undocumented immigrants through the marketplace, it was far from the government-subsidized, taxpayer-funded plan it was made out to be by Trump. We thus rate this claim as \u201cMostly False.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
