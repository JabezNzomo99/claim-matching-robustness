Rand Paul (R-Ky.) repeats a factoid that is simply an urban myth.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2019-01-14T17:37:49.271Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-86192", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/01/27/do-9-out-of-10-new-businesses-fail-as-rand-paul-claims/", "vclaim": "The senator made this statement as he criticized what he described as President Obama\u2019s approach to job creation: \u201cThe president thinks that you collect money from the rest of the country, bring it to Washington, and then we re-pass it out.\u201d As an example, he pointed to the federal government\u2019s ill-fated $534 million loan guarantee to solar-panel manufacturer Solyndra, which in 2011 ceased business operations. (His comment about \u201cone of the richest men in America\u201d appears to refer to George Kaiser, a billionaire who owned a big chunk of the company.)\n\nFor the purposes of this fact check, we are interested in Paul\u2019s claim that nine out of 10 businesses fail \u2014 which he claimed ensured that nine times out of 10, the wrong people would benefit from government largess intended to boost new businesses.\n\nAs far as we can tell, there is no statistical basis for the assertion that nine out of 10 businesses fail. It appears to be one of those nonsense facts that people repeat without thinking too clearly about it. Here are some basic questions to ask when assessing such a factoid:\n\nThere have been a number of studies that have looked at this issue. This chart, from Web site designer smallbusinessplanned.com, summarizes the results of three different studies. Basically, after four years, 50 percent of the businesses are open. As time goes on, the success rate decreases, but it never gets to a failure rate of \u201cnine out of 10.\u201d\n\nOne of the most cited studies on this issue (No. 3 in the chart above) was published in 1989 by Bruce D. Phillips of the National Federation of Independent Business and the late Bruce A. Kirchhoff, director of the technological entrepreneurship program at New Jersey Institute of Technology. They concluded that new establishments with 500 or fewer employees show an average survival rate of 39.8 percent after six years, but that there were wide variations among types of firms.\n\nEven this does not show the whole picture. As Brian Headd, an economist at the Small Business Administration, demonstrated in a 2002 study for Small Business Economics, about one\u2013third of closed business were actually successful when they \u201cfailed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe significant proportion of businesses that closed while successful calls into question the use of \u2018business closure\u2019 as a meaningful measure of business outcome,\u201d the study says. \u201cIt appears that many owners may have executed a planned exit strategy, closed a business without excess debt, sold a viable business, or retired from the work force.\u201d\n\nThere is recent research by Harvard University\u2019s Shikhar Ghosh that three out of every four venture-backed firms fail, which was newsworthy because the failure rate was higher than normally cited by the venture capital industry. But here, again, the use of the phrase \u201cfailure\u201d is a bit misleading. Only about 30 percent result in a total loss of the venture-capital investment; the rest simply did not exit with a full return of the initial investment, such as through an acquisition or initial public offering.\n\nPaul is basing his critique on Obama on a fallacy. Rather than nine out of 10 businesses failing, about 50 percent survive four or five years. Even that percentage may be overstated depending on the definition of \u201cfailure.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
