The claim is false; New South Wales Police said the woman was tasered, not fatally shot, during an incident in Sydney in March 2017; other videos from the scene broadcast in local media reports show the woman was alive following the police encounter.\n\nThe video was published on Facebook here on October 7, 2019. It has been viewed more than 2,000 times.\n\nThe 47-second video shows a woman standing on a street corner, holding a long silver object in her right hand. A police officer discharges a taser at her at the 15-second mark, prompting her to fall backwards. Another two police officers then come into the camera shot.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post's traditional Chinese language caption translates to English as: \u201cA young Chinese woman in Australia crossed the red light and was subsequently stopped by police, who were to hand out punishments.\n\n\u201cThe woman refused to admit her mistakes and started to cause a scene by pulling out a fruit knife from her purse. She thought she could behave like when she was in China, where police wouldn\u2019t do anything.\n\n\u201cShe then stupidly tried to make phone calls in an attempt to seek help and wouldn\u2019t stop even after multiple warnings from police.\n\n\u201cIn the end, she was shot dead on the scene. Foreign police are the laws.\u201d\n\nThe same video has been viewed thousands of times here, here, here and here on Facebook alongside an identical claim.\n\nThe video has also been linked to the ongoing demonstrations in Hong Kong, where AFP reported police had been accused of using excessive and unnecessary force to detain protesters.\n\nThis Weibo post carries a similar caption with an additional paragraph that translates to English as: \u201cYellow ribbons should move promptly to free countries with democracy and civil rights and without totalitarian rule. Go, go, go! This place is very suitable for you!\u201d\n\n\"Yellow ribbons\" is a reference to pro-democracy supporters in Hong Kong.\n\nThis Facebook post describes the shooting without mentioning Australia. An additional part in the caption translates to English as: \u201cTo Carrie Lam: [Hong Kong Police have really crossed the line]\u201d.\n\nThe claim is false; New South Wales Police told AFP the woman, who they said posed a threat to the public, was tasered during an incident in the Sydney suburb of Burwood on March 5, 2017. She was not fatally shot, and was sent to hospital for treatment.\n\nNSW Police Force Senior Media Officer Sonia Roberts described the incident in an email to AFP on October 9, 2019, which in part states:\n\n\u201cAbout 1:20pm today (Sunday 5 March 2017), police attended Victoria Street, Burwood, in relation to a woman on a roadway. Officers from Burwood Local Area Command attended and found a woman with a knife. She was tasered as it was deemed she posed a significant threat to the public.\n\n\u201cThe 42-year-old woman was taken to Concord Hospital for treatment and mental health assessment.\u201d\n\nThe incident happened between Victoria Street and Burwood Road in Burwood, as seen here on Google Street View.\n\nA keyword search on Google found this news segment published by 7NEWS Sydney, the TV news service of Australia\u2019s Seven Network, on March 5, 2017. The video is embedded below.\n\nThe moment the woman fell backwards can be seen between the 18 and 20 second mark of the 7NEWS video, which is titled \u201cWoman carrying a knife tasered by police\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading posts (L) and the corresponding scene in the 7NEWS segment (R):\n\n7NEWS also obtained videos from the scene that show the woman, restrained and flanked by police, sitting on the sidewalk after she was tasered.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the scene:\n\nAustralia's Daily Telegraph newspaper also reported on the incident in this report published on March 6, 2017.", "lang": "en"}
