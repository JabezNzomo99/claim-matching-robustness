The 17-year old man who was allegedly a fan of the 2002 American comedy movie Goldmember, which is a loose parody of the James Bond films Goldfinger, had taken the Spanish nickname of \u201cPelotas de oro\u201d, or golden testicles, before attempting to gold plate his own genitals to his ultimate demise. Dr Ian Joseffson of the Los Angeles Community Hospital warns of a growing trend within gang members to attempt the \u201cdeadly operation.\u201d \u201cI have no idea where this idea comes from but plating one\u2019s own genitals will only ultimately end in serious medical complications or even death, as we have seen in this case\u201d\n\nWhile many readers know that the articles published by World News Daily Report are fictitious, the above-quoted story managed to fool others after it was republished on Link Beef, a web site without a clearly displayed disclaimer.
