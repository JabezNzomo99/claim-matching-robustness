The false post is an edited infographic originally uploaded April 24 by Nueva Ecija TV48 on its official Facebook (FB) page.\n\nOn the contrary, quarantine restrictions will be relaxed in several regions, including Metro Manila, starting June 1 as part of the transition to the so-called new normal, President Rodrigo Duterte announced on Tuesday night.\n\nOther areas that will be placed under a less stringent general community quarantine (GCQ) are regions 2, 3, 4a, Pangasinan, Albay and Davao City.\n\nUnder a GCQ, more business establishments are allowed to reopen while airports and selected mass transport systems can gradually resume operations.\n\n\"In other areas, it will be again a piecemeal basis, depending on the viability of the place to meet the challenges of COVID,\" Duterte said in a televised address.\n\nLuzon was first placed under lockdown in mid-March to contain the coronavirus.\n\nThis is not the first time the announcement by the northern Luzon media company was misleadingly altered.
