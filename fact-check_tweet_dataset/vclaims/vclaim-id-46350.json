It further claims that this can be prevented by posting a disclaimer on the user\u2019s Facebook wall. Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral post is fake. The message is old and circulated over social media time and again.\n\nThe post shared on Facebook reads: \u201cIn the confusion around Covid 19, and just in case this is true. Don\u2019t forget that tomorrow starts the new Facebook rule that our photos can be used. Remember the deadline is today. They can be used in lawsuits against us. Everything we posted today goes public, even messages deleted. It takes nothing to make a simple copy and paste: better safe than sorry. I don\u2019t allow Facebook or any Facebook training to use my photos, information, messages or posts, either from the past or in the future\u201d. With this statement, I give a notification to Facebook that it is strictly forbidden to reveal, copy, distribute or take other actions against me based on this profile and / or its contents. The content of this profile is private and confidential information. The violation of my personal life can be punished by law.\u201d The complete post can be read in its archived version here.\n\nVishvas News investigated and found that, according to the \u2018Terms and Conditions\u2018 of Facebook, \u201cyou own the intellectual property rights (things like copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on Facebook and the other Facebook Company Products you use. Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want.\u201d\n\nOn the \u2018Help Community\u2018 page of Facebook, a user has posted a question in which he has pasted the same message as the viral post. Facebook has replied to the post stating that this is a scam message and users should report this post whenever they see it.\n\nVishvas News contacted Facebook through email. The spokesperson of Facebook quoted: \u201cFacebook takes privacy seriously and we have a range of controls built into our product that enable people to determine who sees the content they share on Facebook. We would never arbitrarily make private posts and photographs public without express consent.\u201d\n\nThe post is shared on Facebook by a user named Raquel Manrique. When we scanned the profile of the user we found that the user is based out of Florida.\n\nConclusion: The post claiming amid COVID-19 pandemic, Facebook has changed its privacy rules, allowing it to use pictures and posts shared by users in lawsuits against them is fake.", "lang": "en"}
