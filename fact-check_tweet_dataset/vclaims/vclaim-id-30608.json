Can we afford to wait another 79 years before we reach net zero in this country?\u201d\n\nThere is not enough evidence to support Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s claim that the government will not meet its net zero emissions target until 2099\u201449 years later than planned.\n\nLabour\u2019s claim rests on the assumption that carbon emissions will continue to reduce at the same rate they did last year. And that in 2099 emissions will finally be low enough (according to the World Wide Fund for Nature) to be offset with carbon capture initiatives.\n\nAs we\u2019ve written before, simply drawing a line into the future has little value as a prediction or forecast.\n\nThe net zero target aims for the UK to emit as many greenhouse gasses as it removes from the environment by 2050. Although the UK has made fast progress on cutting emissions\u2014which have fallen 43% since 1990\u2014we have written before it is unlikely to reach the target.\n\nThe claim, made at Prime Ministers\u2019 Questions for the last two weeks, was originally cited by Mr Corbyn in July last year, and is based on Labour analysis of emissions rates.\n\nThe analysis is based on two assumptions. An assumption about what level of emissions can be balanced by offsetting measures, and an assumption about when the UK will reach that level of emissions. Both are uncertain.\n\nOn the first, Labour used a figure suggested by the WWF that 94 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions \u201cis sufficiently low to be compensated for by GGR [greenhouse gas removal] and achieve net-zero emissions\u201d. This figure is not used by the Committee on Climate Change (an independent body that advises the government) or by the government. Because Labour\u2019s analysis only focused on carbon emissions it adjusted that 94 million tonnes of greenhouse gas (though there are some issues with using this figure which we\u2019ll get to in a moment). Around 80% of greenhouse gases in any given year are carbon emissions, so Labour set the target as roughly 80% of the 94 million tonnes.\n\nAs for when Labour expect the UK to reach this target it took the current net CO2 emissions and assumed that the estimated 2% fall observed between 2017 and 2018 would be replicated every year. Using this method the \u2018target\u2019 in Labour\u2019s analysis would be met by roughly the end of the century, though by our count slightly earlier than 2099.\n\nBut carbon emissions are variable and looking at the change over just one year could give a misleading impression. Carbon dioxide emissions fell by 2.9% between 2016 and 2017, and by 5.7% between 2015 and 2016. When doing the same calculation but using an average of the last three years\u2019 reductions, the Labour analysis says the target would be met nearly 30 years sooner in 2061, illustrating the volatility of its estimate.\n\nA spokesperson for the Committee on Climate Change said: \u201cAnnual emissions reductions are likely to vary, and average emissions reductions in the past are not necessarily an indicator for future emissions.\u201d\n\nIn its original analysis Labour said it was looking at when the target would be met if \u201cprogress continues at its current rate\u201d so it doesn\u2019t include the possibility that carbon reduction could accelerate, perhaps through advancements in new technologies, or even slow over the coming decades.\n\nEven if Labour\u2019s methodology had been fair, it also made mistakes when doing the calculation.\n\nFirstly, there are issues with the figure it used when projecting forward last year\u2019s carbon dioxide reduction.\n\nAs we mentioned the analysis Labour did was based on provisional figures for the estimated fall in carbon emissions between 2017 and 2018. In the original press release from July 2019, Labour said: \u201cEmission reduction has slowed to a crawl in recent years, with the amount of carbon released falling only 1.5 per cent in 2018\u201d. In the analysis we\u2019ve seen, Labour said this was rounded to 2%.\n\nBut the provisional figures on carbon emissions didn\u2019t say they only fell by 1.5% between 2017 and 2018. They said they fell by 2.4%.\n\nUsing the 2% rounded figure, Labour found net zero wouldn\u2019t be achieved until 2099. If Labour had used the unrounded 2.4% figure, net zero would have been projected to have been achieved by 2086\u2014a full 13 years earlier\n\nThe final data, published this week, shows carbon emissions fell 2.2% between 2017 and 2018.\n\nThe second problem with Labour\u2019s sums is that they seem to have misinterpreted the findings of the WWF.\n\nThe WWF said that 94 million tonnes of greenhouse gas could be removed and so emissions of 94 million tonnes would achieve net-zero. That 94 million tonnes is a gross figure so doesn\u2019t count any greenhouse gas removal. However, the government statistics Labour used as a starting point for its analysis are net figures, as they take into account both the current gross emissions and gross removals.\n\nTherefore Labour was wrong to assume that when net carbon emissions reach 80% of 94 million tonnes it would equate to net zero\u2014their forecasting should either have measured when the UK\u2019s net emissions are projected to reach zero or when the UK\u2019s gross emissions are projected to reach 94 million tonnes.\n\nThe WWF figures also include emissions from shipping and aviation, but these are omitted from the government emissions figures used by Labour for their analysis.", "lang": "en"}
