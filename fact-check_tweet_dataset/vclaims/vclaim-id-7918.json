As the expansion plans take shape, the production team is hard at work updating the existing shows for 2018. \u201cOur shows currently are identified by where they are located,\u201d Dolly said. \u201cSome examples are Smoky Mountain Adventures or Dixie Stampede. We also recognize that attitudes change and feel that by streamlining the names of our shows, it will remove any confusion or concerns about our shows and will help our efforts to expand into new cities.\u201d To that end, WCI\u2019s legacy show, Dolly Parton\u2019s Dixie Stampede, will become simply Dolly Parton\u2019s Stampede for the 2018 season.\n\nThe change in the venue\u2019s name prompted cries that Parton and the show\u2019s organizers were bending to \u201cpolitical correctness,\u201d a buzzword that essentially means adhering to language and policies that do not offend groups that have been socially marginalized or oppressed. For example Knox County Mayor Tim Burchett told Knox News:\n\nWell, like everybody else, I love Dolly, and I love all that she\u2019s done for our community, which is her community, and I\u2019m disappointed that they\u2019re yielding to political correctness. What\u2019s next? Are we going to change the name of Dixie cups and the Dixie sugar company? You know, I just hope they don\u2019t change their Christmas program.\n\nDespite the outcry, which is cropping up around the country as various businesses and local governments remove imagery or language that appears to glorify the slave-owning South, the venue did remove \u201cDixie\u201d from the show\u2019s name. The url and web site for the venue have already been changed from \u201cdixiestampede.com\u201d to \u201cdpstampede.com.\u201d\n\n\n\n In August 2017, after a man drove into a crowd of counter-protesters and killed a woman at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Slate culture writer Aisha Harris panned the show as a \u201clily-white kitsch extravaganza that play-acts the Civil War but never once mentions slavery\u201d that romanticized the Civil War-era South:\n\nThe same week that a statue of Robert E. Lee led to the death of an innocent woman in Charlottesville, Virginia, I watched him oink and squeal in a race for the fate of the country. Lee, this time, was a piglet\u2014part of Dolly Parton\u2019s Dixie Stampede, a Medieval Times\u2013style dine-in attraction where seven nights a week and at occasional weekend matinees, the South rises again. Advertised as an \u201cextraordinary dinner show \u2026 pitting North against South in a friendly and fun rivalry,\u201d Dolly Parton\u2019s Dixie Stampede is the Lost Cause of the Confederacy meets Cirque du Soleil.", "lang": "en"}
