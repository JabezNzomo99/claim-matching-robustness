I think one reason she was a good judge is she had no judicial experience,\" Reid said on May 11, 2010.\n\n\n\nHe pointed out that O'Connor served in the Arizona state legislature, giving her a different perspective on legal matters.\n\n\n\n\"I think Solicitor General Kagan will bring a lot of those same views ... to the bench. That is, she has fresh ideas, she's been out in the real world recently,\" Reid said. \n\n\n\nIndeed, before taking a role in Obama's administration, Kagan was the dean of Harvard Law School, a law professor and an advisor to former President Bill Clinton. Prior to that, she served as a clerk for Judge Abner Mikva of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and Justice Thurgood Marshall of the U.S. Supreme Court. But Kagan has never been a judge, something her critics are quick to point out. \n\n\n\nO'Connor, who retired from the court 2005, also had a variety of jobs, serving as Deputy County Attorney of San Mateo County, California, and as an Arizona state senator.\n\n\n\nBut unlike Kagan, O'Connor had been a judge. \n\n\n\nIn 1975, O'Connor was elected a judge of the Maricopa County Superior Court, where she served until 1979, when she was appointed to the Arizona Court of Appeals, according to her biography on the U.S. Supreme Court Web site. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan nominated O'Connor to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court. \n\n\n\nWe asked Reid's spokesman, Jim Manley, if we were missing something, and he wrote that Reid had simply misspoken.\n\n\n\nSo, O'Connor had six years of judicial experience before she was nominated for a seat on the highest court. We find Reid's claim to be False.", "lang": "en"}
