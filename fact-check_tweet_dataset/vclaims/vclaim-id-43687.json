It was later amplified by Sean Hannity and published by other websites.\n\n\n\nTwo years ago, a self-proclaimed satirical website made up a politically charged email and claimed that it had been released by WikiLeaks. That fictitious email is still circulating online, and it\u2019s being presented as though it is real.\n\nIt originated on Dec. 7, 2016, on a website called America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, which describes its content as satire aimed at provoking conservatives. Six days later, the phony email was copied and included in a story on a prominent partisan site, the Conservative Daily Post. Two days after that, conservative commentator Sean Hannity read the made-up email on his radio show, saying if true it \u201ccould shake up the political world.\u201d\n\nSince then, the invented email has been copied by popular, but unreliable, websites like Yournewswire.com and the now-defunct Freedom Daily.\n\nAnd it\u2019s still making headlines on dubious websites, such as the Columbus Post. The story on that site has been shared on 29 different Facebook pages since it was posted on Sept. 2.\n\nThe claims made in the stories that cite the phony email have morphed over the years, but the text of the email has stayed the same.\n\nWhen America\u2019s Last Line of Defense originally posted the story, it had a headline that said: \u201cWikileaks Latest: Podesta Emails Show 3 PROMINENT Republicans On Clinton Payroll.\u201d\n\nBut that claim has changed as the story has circulated online. For example, the headline on the Columbus Post says: \u201cWikileaks Huge Exposure: These Are The Six Republicans That Hillary Had Bribed To \u2018Destroy Trump\u2019!\u201d\n\nThe email was supposedly sent from John Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, to longtime Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, and it references the initials of Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina, and John Kasich \u2014 all of whom sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.\n\nThe story claims that the email is \u201cdocument number 1078645\u201d on the WikiLeaks website. But that document number corresponds to a real 2009 email that was included in a release of files from an intelligence company called Stratfor. It has nothing to do with the 2016 presidential election.\n\nA search of Podesta\u2019s hacked emails, which WikiLeaks posted on Oct. 7, 2016, turns up no results for the bogus email.\n\nAlso, the original story claimed that the email was sent in July 2016, but by that time all three of those GOP presidential contenders had dropped out of the race. Fiorina dropped out on Feb. 10, 2016, Bush withdrew on Feb. 20, 2016, and Kasich dropped out on May 4, 2016.\n\nUpdated, Sept. 17: Yournewswire.com retracted its story, which it acknowledged was false. \u201cThe email was fabricated by a self-described satirical website,\u201d it said in a note to readers.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nCole, Michael. \u201c6 Republicans May Have Taken Payments From Clinton Team To Damage Trump (New Wiki Leak).\u201d Conservative Daily Post. 13 Dec 2016.\n\nConservative Citizen. \u201cJulian Assange on The Sean Hannity Radio Show (12/15/2016).\u201d Youtube.com. 25 May 2018.\n\n\u201cWikileaks Huge Exposure: These Are The Six Republicans That Hillary Had Bribed To \u2018Destroy Trump\u2019!\u201d Columbuspost.site. 2 Sep 2018.\n\nWikiLeaks.
