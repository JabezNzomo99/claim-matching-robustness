The claim originates from a satire website.\n\nJill Biden has frequently appeared on the presidential campaign trail with her husband, giving interviews and speaking at events. The viral post, which cites the New York Post but does not provide a link, claims she recently announced that if Joe Biden wins the election in November, all Americans will be required to learn Spanish.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation searched the New York Post\u2019s website for such a story but found no articles to corroborate the post\u2019s claim. There also doesn\u2019t appear to be any reporting about her making such a statement in any other credible media outlets.

The satire website\u2019s \u201cAbout Us\u201d page explicitly states that \u201ceverything on this website is fiction,\u201d but the US Mags Press article fails to disclaim the satirical origins of the content, a common way misinformation spreads online.\n\nThe U.S. does not have an official language. Data from the Census Bureau shows that 78.5 percent of people five-years-old and over in the U.S. only speak English at home, while 21.5 percent speak a language other than English at home. 13.3 percent of people in the U.S. speak Spanish at home, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
