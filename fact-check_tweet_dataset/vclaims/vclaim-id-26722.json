{"title": "Did Advice Columnist Ann Landers Say This About Aging?", "subtitle": "It might be faster if we credited everyone at every age with authoring this quote.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2019-10-29T16:41:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-26722", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ann-landers-quote-about-aging/", "vclaim": "This quote can be attributed to advice columnist Ann Landers: \u201cAt age 20, we worry about what others think of us. At age 40, we don't care what they think of us. At age 60, we discover they haven't been thinking of us at all.\u201d\n\nIn October 2019 it came to our attention that an aging platitude about aging, already credited to multiple sources, found a new voice:\n\nThe meme appeared on Get Old, a lifestyle blog published by a pharmaceutical company. The same quote has been attributed to Landers on several sites, including Psychology Today.\n\nHowever, the quote does not surface in searches at AnnLanders.com, an advice column launched in 2019 by Landers\u2019 daughter, Margo Howard. The site is also advertised as an archive of Landers\u2019 columns.\n\nThat\u2019s not the only reason to doubt the credit.\n\nA similar quote has been attributed to Bob Hope, Anonymous, \u201ca wise old man,\u201d and Winston Churchill. Snopes investigated that last one in December 2018:\n\nNot so long ago, this particular quote about aging existed on the Internet primarily as a wise saying attributed to \u201cAnonymous\u201d or \u201cUnknown.\u201d For example, motivational speaker Bill Benjamin included it as such on his list of \u201cFavorite Quotes & Thoughts\u201d as far back as 2008. This quote appears in myriad other lists of anonymous sayings as well and was \u201cmemed\u201d into a Churchill quote only fairly recently.\n\nWe rate the newer variation of this claim as \u201cMisattributed\u201d because, although Landers could have given some version of this advice during the 47 years she was publishing columns, there is no available evidence to prove that the exact quote originated with her.\n\nUnfortunately, Landers (Esther Pauline \u201cEppie\u201d Lederer) died in 2002 at the age of 83, so we cannot ask her to confirm directly.\n\nHere is advice on aging Landers did recommend for \u201ceveryone over 60.\u201d Again, however, not her words. The list was written by one of her readers.\n\nHave you seen other variations of this claim? Let us know.", "lang": "en"}
