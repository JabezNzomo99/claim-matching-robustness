In the video, the vice president assists in unloading personal protective equipment from a truck and upon being told that they were finished aside from a few empty boxes, Pence asks: \u201cWell can I carry the empty ones? Just for the camera?\u201d\n\nThe segment went viral on Twitter, with even prominent figures like NBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell and Rep. Bill Pascrell, Jr. sharing the video:\n\nKimmel\u2019s segment, however, was edited to leave out important context; namely that Pence appears to be joking. The full interaction can be viewed on CSPAN\u2019s website (at approximately the 9:05 mark), and shows the vice president and those he\u2019s talking to laughing after he asks the question. Pence then closed the van\u2019s doors and walked away to thank some workers and give remarks. Here is the relevant portion, in a video posted by PBS.\n\nBased on the unedited video, it\u2019s clear that Kimmel\u2019s segment was misleading and that the vice president wasn\u2019t \u201cpretending to carry empty boxes of PPEs into a hospital.\u201d And Kimmel himself has now acknowledged that with a follow-up tweet.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
