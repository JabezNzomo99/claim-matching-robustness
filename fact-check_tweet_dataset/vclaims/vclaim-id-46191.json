Tony Evers to make the election mail balloting only, the state\u2019s Republican Legislature, backed by a Republican-majority state Supreme Court, opposed Evers\u2019 plan. In person voting was held amid social distancing, though with significantly fewer polling places.\n\nAt briefings on April 7 and 8, President Donald Trump was asked about an expanded role for mail balloting at a time of a global pandemic. He responded by criticizing mail balloting as illegitimate and subject to widespread fraud (even though he had recently voted by mail for a Florida election).\n\nOn April 7, Trump said, \"Now, mail ballots \u2014 they cheat. Okay? People cheat. Mail ballots are a very dangerous thing for this country, because they're cheaters. They go and collect them. They're fraudulent in many cases.\"\n\nWhen pressed, Trump went on to call mail-in voting \"horrible\" and \"corrupt\" and alleged that \"you get thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody\u2019s living room, signing ballots all over the place.\"\n\nAt the following day\u2019s briefing, a reporter asked Trump for evidence to support the \"thousands and thousands\" characterization.\n\nTrump responded, \"I think there's a lot of evidence, but we'll provide you with some, okay?\" (The White House did not provide PolitiFact with additional evidence.)\n\nTrump did cite a lawsuit by the conservative group Judicial Watch against the state of California, saying that \"a million people should not have been voting\" in the state. However, PolitiFact California previously rated a similar assertion by the president Pants on Fire, because the legal settlement in question required Los Angeles County to begin removing inactive voter registrations; it said nothing about voter fraud or people illegally voting.\n\nIn recent years, Trump has repeatedly claimed the existence of massive voter fraud and election rigging, which we\u2019ve debunked again and again and again and again and again and again and again.\n\nIn his most recent comments, we found no support for the notion that \"you get thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody's living room, signing ballots all over the place.\"\n\nWe did find that mail balloting does pose a potentially higher risk for fraud than in-person voting does. However, experts said the reality is much more nuanced than Trump let on.\n\n\"I can\u2019t imagine any living room with thousands of people in it,\" said Rick Hasen, a University of California-Irvine law professor who specializes in election law. But even to the extent he\u2019s saying that vote-by-mail efforts are rife with fraud, \"that is false,\" Hasen said.\n\n\"There are more cases of absentee ballot fraud than other kinds of election crimes,\" he said. \"But the risk is relatively low, and the benefits, especially during the time of a pandemic, are quite great.\"\n\nVoting and election specialists said there\u2019s no evidence that \"thousands and thousands\" of Americans are collaborating on mail-ballot fraud, whether they\u2019re sitting in one living room or not.\n\n\"There is no evidence that any candidate or group has executed a mail ballot fraud scheme of this magnitude in modern elections,\" said Michael P. McDonald, a University of Florida political scientist. \"In this day of social media, it is nearly impossible to keep anything secret, much less a scheme involving thousands of people.\"\n\nIf this was happening, McDonald said, voters would wonder where their ballots were. \"They would show up to vote and be told by election officials that they had already voted,\" he said. \"Election officials would see patterns in where mail ballots were being sent, the addresses they were being returned from, and the signatures on the ballot return envelope. If a mail ballot fraud scheme happened on the alleged scale, someone, somewhere, would notice.\"\n\nMore broadly, repeated efforts to uncover widespread voter fraud have produced little.\n\u2022 Trump\u2019s Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, a panel to investigate voter fraud, was shuttered before it found significant patterns of fraud.\n\u2022 News21, a national investigative reporting project funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, found just 56 cases of noncitizens voting between 2000 and 2011.\n\u2022 In 2012, Florida Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s administration tried to crack down on noncitizens voting by comparing driver's license data against voter rolls. The Florida Department of State created a list of 182,000 potential noncitizens that had voted. That number was whittled down to 2,700, then to about 200 before the purge was stopped amid criticism that the data was flawed given the number of false positives \u2014 including a Brooklyn-born World War II vet. Ultimately, only 85 people were removed from the voter rolls.\n\u2022 The five states that hold all-mail elections (Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah, and Washington) have reported little fraud. \"There\u2019s just very little evidence that there is more than a handful of fraudulent (vote-by-mail) cases across the country in a given election cycle,\" Judd Choate, the director of elections in the Colorado Department of State, told the New York Times.\n\nRichard Winger, the editor of Ballot Access News and a frequent election volunteer in San Francisco, said ballot security measures in his state offer protections.\n\n\"We have a list of all the registered voters in our precinct,\" Winger said. \"The list indicates which voters have received a ballot in the postal mail. In every election, voters wander in and want to vote there, but we say, \u2018It says here you already got a mail ballot.\u2019 And they say, \u2018Oh, yes, it's at home\u2019 or, \u2018I never received a ballot\u2019 or, \u2018Oh, I lost it.\u2019 And we explain that every ballot must be accounted for. They can vote provisionally at the polls, but the vote will only be counted once it is clear their original ballot didn't get submitted for counting.\"\n\nSteve Schale, a longtime Democratic consultant in Florida, said his state has improved its mail-ballot procedures in recent years.\n\n\"I think the controls that are in place today really limit the opportunities for fraud,\" Schale said. \"Back in the day, there was more ability for operatives to actually put their hands on ballots, such as collecting them and turning them in. Operatives on both sides will always push up to the legal line when it comes to all aspects of campaigns, but again, the laws now are so clear that one has to go out of their way to break the law.\"\n\nRare doesn\u2019t mean nonexistent. And experts agree that mail balloting does provide a greater potential for ballot fraud than in-person voting does.\n\n\"It's definitely easier to have fraud with absentee voting than in-person voting, and some cases of it have had a big impact,\" said Rob Richie, president of FairVote, a voting-access advocacy group.\n\nA congressional election was overturned in North Carolina in 2018 after evidence surfaced that the Republican candidate benefited from an effort to collect absentee ballots from voters. In South Florida alone, the Miami Herald cited examples of ballot fraud in Hialeah (1994, 2011, and 2012), Homestead (2014), and Miami and Miami-Dade County (1998, 2008, 2013).\n\n\"All this must be kept in perspective, and there are ways states seek to counter it, but it's not outlandish to say fraud is more likely with absentee voting than in-person voting,\" Richie said.\n\nLonna Atkeson, University of New Mexico political scientist, told NPR that \"where there is fraud in the system, it really seems to be in mail balloting. There's some, there's not a lot. I think there's a little bit.\"\n\nOther drawbacks with voting by mail\n\nWhile voting by mail might be necessary in an extended battle with coronavirus, voting experts acknowledge that it\u2019s not a perfect solution.\n\u2022 There could be an increase in voter errors made at home, since election officials won\u2019t be standing nearby to help. This means more ballots could be rejected and not counted.\n\u2022 Voter education will be needed for people who are unaccustomed to absentee voting. Voters will need reminders to sign their ballots, and elections officials will need to increase public outreach to dispel myths about absentee ballots, such as the one that those ballots aren\u2019t counted unless an election is close.\n\u2022 Some groups have less convenient access to mail than others do, such as residents of Native American reservations. Mail voting also poses challenges for voters who move frequently, or who have language or literacy issues. And some disabled voters, including those who are blind, cannot effectively cast mail ballots without assistance.\n\u2022 Voting at home could lead to coercion by abusive spouses or other relatives.\n\nTrump said that with voting by mail, \"you get thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody's living room, signing ballots all over the place.\"\n\nVoting fraud in general is considered to be rare, although voting experts agree that the risks are greater for mail balloting than for in-person voting. Still, Trump didn\u2019t produce any evidence for the \"thousands and thousands\" claim, and voting experts said his assertion doesn\u2019t square with what is known about the actual cases of voting fraud in the recent past.", "lang": "en"}
