In May 2018, after dozens of Palestinians were killed along the Gaza border during protests following a ceremony marking the relocation of the United States Embassy in Israel to the city of Jerusalem, that 2013 clip was shared on Twitter as if it showed a group of Palestinian martyrs staging their deaths:\n\nThis piece of propaganda was re-shared by far-right personalities such as Paul Joseph Watson and Ben Shapiro, and radio host Wayne Dupree also hosted the video on his web site as part of an article titled \u201cAt First Glance You See Palestinian Martyrs Until One Needs to Scratch His Nose.\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time the same video (which can be viewed at the bottom of this article) had been shared out of context. In 2014, for instance, the Conservative Post offered the video to readers, claiming that it depicted Hamas staging an Islamic funeral:\n\nThis video has also been shared as if it constituted \u201cevidence\u201d that the 2013 Rabaa massacre had been staged, as if it showed crisis actors in the aftermath of a chemical attack in Syria, and as if it were a piece of \u201cHamas propaganda\u201d depicting a group of Muslims faking civilian deaths.\n\nThis footage, however, doesn\u2019t capture anyone attempting to stage a mass casualty event. It actually shows a group of students at Cairo\u2019s Al-Azhar University taking part in a \u201cdie-in\u201d protest and was originally shared on the YouTube page of Al Badil, an Egyptian news outlet:\n\nAl Badil uploaded several other videos from this protest as well, such as the following:\n\nAn English-language report published by Ahram in October 2013 provided more context about the protest:\n\nStudents at Al-Azhar University in Cairo\u2019s Nasr City district staged what they called \u201canti-coup\u201d demonstrations on campus as tensions rise between them and security forces. Groups of students have been protesting what they call a \u201cmilitary coup\u201d that toppled Islamist president Mohamed Morsi. They reject the country\u2019s interim leadership and call for Morsi\u2019s reinstatement. Dozens of students protested at Al-Azhar\u2019s Faculty of Arabic Language, chanting slogans like \u201cOne word, always remember \u2026 The soldiers will not rule us.\u201d Meanwhile, the university closed down its administration building, where students had been protesting for a week, for \u201crenovations,\u201d Al-Ahram Arabic news website reported.\n\nTo sum up: This video doesn\u2019t show anyone\u2019s getting \u201ccaught\u201d faking their own deaths, but rather a \u201cdie-in\u201d form of protest staged by students at Egypt\u2019s Al-Azhar University in 2013.", "lang": "en"}
