The latest comparable figures are for 2015, and show that the UK had the highest defence spending in Europe that year, spending just under \u20ac55 billion. France was second, spending \u20ac38 billion, and Germany third with \u20ac31 billion.\n\nRelative to the size of each country\u2019s GDP, Greece spent the most in 2015 (2.7% of GDP), followed by the UK (2.1%), Estonia (1.9%) and France (1.8%). As a proportion of each country\u2019s total government spending, the UK spent the most (5% of the total), followed by Greece (4.9%) and Estonia (4.7%). Measured this way France was much further down the league table, in 9th place at 3.1%.\n\nThe International Institute for Strategic Studies\u2019 (IISS), an international affairs think tank, has more recent figures covering 2016 and it also found the UK had higher defence spending than any other European country. France and Germany came in second and third respectively.\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), another think tank, has slightly different findings. It shows that France had the highest defence spending in 2016, the UK was second, and Germany third.\n\nWe\u2019ve written about the differences between the SIPRI and IISS data in the past. The problem is there\u2019s no single definition of military expenditure. When we spoke to SIPRI in 2015 it suggested its calculation of France\u2019s spending is higher because it includes the paramilitary Gendarmerie while other sources do not. We\u2019re checking with them whether or not this is still the case.", "lang": "en"}
