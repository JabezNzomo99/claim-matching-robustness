On top of each column, are 3-digit numbers not specifically labeled.\n\nHowever, the complete row for Gutoc appears to be blank, implying that there was no supposed vote for her. In the fifth column, only 11 candidates have indicated votes while the rest also have empty cells.\n\nThe caption of the tweet says, \"Sure akong binoto ko at ng pamilya ko si Samira Gutoc pero bakit sa Brgy namin, naka blank siya? (I am sure that my family and I voted for Samira Gutoc, but why does she have no votes in our barangay?)\n\nThe claim also went viral on Facebook through a post by Facebook user Jhun Conga who asked why Gutoc has no votes at all in the entire city of Mandaluyong.\n\nThe website philnews.ph also published an article with the claim. The article has been shared 20 times on Facebook gaining over 20,000 interactions.\n\nData published on the Commission on Elections' (Comelec) website and released via the Comelec's Transparency and Media Servers for the 2019 election results show that Gutoc received a total of 478 votes in 6 clustered precincts of Barangay San Jose in Mandaluyong City. Gutoc got a total of 24,208 votes from 27 barangays in Mandaluyong City.\n\nAsked about the photograph of the bulletin board, Alba told Rappler that the photo was taken in front of the Filemon Elementary School in the said barangay.", "lang": "en"}
