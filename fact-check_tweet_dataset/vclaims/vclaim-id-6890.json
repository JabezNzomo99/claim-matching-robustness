Never, never, never.\n\n\u2014 Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, at the Capitol on Thursday.\n\nChina and Russia, as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, voted to impose sanctions against Iran in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2010. (Ms. Pelosi even commended the 2010 vote in a news release.)\n\nThe Security Council resolutions during those years embargoed Iran\u2019s nuclear material and equipment, and arms sales. They also froze the financial assets of individuals linked to Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\n\u201cThe Russians and Chinese did support us in four rounds of sanctions. That was something,\u201d said Richard Nephew, a sanctions expert and former State Department official during the Obama administration.\n\nThough Russia and China were willing to join United Nations sanctions against Iran, Mr. Nephew said the two countries were reluctant \u2014 or even \u201cvery hostile\u201d \u2014 when it came to enforcing penalties similar to those imposed on Tehran\u2019s oil and financial sectors by the United States, the European Union and other Asian countries.", "lang": "en"}
