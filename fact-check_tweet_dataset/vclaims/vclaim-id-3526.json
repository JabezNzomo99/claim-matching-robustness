The figure peaked in 2007 and has fallen slightly since then.\n\n97% of abortions for residents in England and Wales in 2016 were on the grounds that the pregnancy continuing posed a risk of injury to the mother\u2019s physical or mental health, \u201cgreater than if the pregnancy were terminated\u201d.\n\nThere were 13 recorded abortions in Northern Ireland in 2016/17. The law on abortion is different there, which we\u2019ll cover later on.\n\nAbortions for women who were non-residents\n\nRoughly 5,000 abortions in England and Wales in 2016 were for non-residents\u20143% of the total recorded number. Most of these abortions were for women from Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\nIn Ireland, abortion is currently illegal unless the mother\u2019s life is in danger. In May 2018, a referendum was held in which the Irish people voted to repeal and replace the article in the constitution which sets this law. The new laws on abortion have not yet been implemented, but the Irish government has proposed that they include that abortion be allowed \u201cwithout specific indication\u201d up to the twelfth week of pregnancy.\n\nIn Northern Ireland abortion is only legal if \u201cit is necessary to preserve the life of the woman\u201d, or if there is considered to be \u201ca risk of real and serious adverse effect on her physical or mental health, which is either long term or permanent\u201d. This is based on legislation from 1861 and 1945, and more recent case law.\n\nIn Scotland, seven women who weren\u2019t resident in the country had abortions there in 2016\u2014although there is no more information on where they were from. But the Scottish government says that women from outside Scotland might be counted as Scottish residents if they provide a temporary Scottish address.\n\nThe law on abortion in Britain\n\nThe Abortion Act 1967 applies to England, Wales and Scotland, but not to Northern Ireland. It allows for abortions to be carried out by a registered doctor if certain conditions are met.\n\nAn abortion is generally allowed up to the twenty-fourth week of a pregnancy if two doctors think that continuing the pregnancy involves a risk \u201cgreater than if the pregnancy were terminated\u201d to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman, or to other children in her family.\n\nThere is no time limit on when an abortion can be carried out if two doctors think the pregnancy involves a risk to the pregnant woman\u2019s life \u201cgreater than if the pregnancy were terminated\u201d, or will cause \u201cgrave permanent injury\u201d to the pregnant woman\u2019s physical or mental health. If these cases are an emergency then the approval of a second doctor isn\u2019t required.\n\nAn abortion can also be carried out at any time if there is a substantial risk that if the child was born, it would be with \u201cphysical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped\u201d.\n\nThe Abortion Act 1967 provides a list of legal exceptions. Abortion is still illegal, unless one of the above criteria are fulfilled and the abortion is carried out \u201cin the NHS or an approved independent sector place in the NHS or an approved independent sector place\u201d.\n\nIn 2017, the House of Commons voted in principle for a bill proposing to change the law on abortion, and we wrote about this at the time. But the proposed bill was never completed, due to parliament being dissolved soon after for the general election.\n\nWe take reader suggestions, so please send us any other claims you want us to factcheck.", "lang": "en"}
