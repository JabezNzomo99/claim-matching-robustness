The quote appears to have originated with singer Dolly Parton in the 1990s.\n\nWhile former presidents often leave behind in their writings plenty of quotable material, this \u201cWednesday Wisdom\u201d shared by the Facebook page cannot be attributed to the nation\u2019s sixth president. President Donald Trump has also previously cited Adams as the author of the quote.\n\nSuch an expression does not appear in the digital collection of Adams\u2019 diary or in the writings of Adams compiled by the Hathi Trust.\n\nFred Kaplan, who wrote a biography of Adams, told The Daily Caller in an email that \u201cit reads like a statement totally at variance with his language & views.\u201d\n\nThe Massachusetts Historical Society, which curates Adams\u2019 papers, confirmed to the Caller that it has fact-checked this quote as false in the past. It provided a list of actual quotations from Adams, which includes statements such as, \u201cA politician in this country must be the man of a party. I would fain be the man of my whole country.\u201d\n\nOther variations of the quote in question attribute it to country music star Parton, which appears likely.\n\nParton contributed her thoughts to the 1997 book \u201cThe Most Important Thing I Know,\u201d where she said, \u201cIf your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader.\u201d\n\nShe wrote a 2013 book called \u201cDream More: Celebrate the Dreamer in You,\u201d which was an expansion on her 2009 commencement address at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. In that commencement address, Parton said that she wanted the graduates to \u201cdream more, learn more, care more and be more.\u201d\n\nFootball player Peyton Manning included a similar version of the quote in a speech he gave in 1998, according to the website Quote Investigator, though he did not take credit or offer attribution.", "lang": "en"}
