According to the New York Times, one of Trump\u2019s first newspaper appearances was in 1973, when the Trump Management Corporation was sued by the Department of Justice and charged for violating the Fair Housing Act of 1968:\n\nTrump was also accused of racism in 1989, when he took out full page ads calling for the return of the death penalty in several New York City newspapers. The ads were published a few weeks after a 28-year-old woman was raped while jogging in Central Park. Five men were arrested for the attack:\n\nThe incident stirred racial tensions in the city, with many accusing Trump of adding fuel to the fire. When evidence surfaced in 2002 that would eventually lead to the exoneration of the five men who were charged with rape, protesters criticized Trump for his racially charged rhetoric:\n\nOn May 1, 1989, Donald J. Trump took out full-page advertisements in four New York newspapers calling for the return of the death penalty. Mr. Trump said he wanted the \u201dcriminals of every age\u201d who were accused of beating and raping a jogger in Central Park 12 days earlier \u201dto be afraid.\u201d Thirteen years later, as new evidence raises the possibility that the five teenagers convicted in the attack had nothing to do with it, their supporters are focusing some of their fiercest anger at Mr. Trump. \u201cTrump is a chump!\u201d protesters shouted during a recent demonstration, accusing Mr. Trump of, at least, further inflaming passions and perhaps tainting the defendants\u2019 future jurors. Some called him a racist. Supporters of the Central Park defendants have demanded an apology.\n\nFormer employees of Donald Trump also accused the real estate mogul of racism back in the 1990s. John R. O\u2019Donnell, the one-time president of Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino, wrote in his 1991 book Trumped! that his former employer frequently used racial slurs:\n\nA book written by one of Donald Trump\u2019s former casino executives accuses Trump of calling his biggest gamblers \u201cslobs,\u201d of making racial slurs against black people and of being largely ignorant about the casino business. O\u2019Donnell described a dinner conversation with Trump in which, he writes, they discussed Trump Plaza\u2019s financial executive, who was black. He quoted Trump as saying he never liked the man and believed he was not doing a good job. Trump\u2019s conversation is recounted: \u201cAnd isn\u2019t it funny. I\u2019ve got black accountants at Trump Castle and Trump Plaza. Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. . . . I think the guy is lazy. And it\u2019s probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It\u2019s not anything they can control.\u201d\n\nThe real estate mogul was also accused of making racist remarks when he testified before the House Native American Affairs Subcommittee in 1993:\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t look like Indians to me and they don\u2019t look like Indians to Indians,\u201d said Donald Trump in words which led to immediate accusations of racism and bigotry. Mr Trump was attacking the tiny tribe of Mashantucket Pequot Indians in Connecticut whose casino, with profits of $1 million dollars a day, has just outgrown his own casinos in Atlantic City to become the largest in the United States. He said: \u2018It will be the biggest scandal since Al Capone and it will destroy the gambling industry\u2019 if the Pequots and members of the 515 other Indian tribes in the US continue to exploit their status as sovereign nations to start casino gambling. Mr Trump, speaking to a Congressional committee, added: \u2018It\u2019s obvious that organised crime is rampant on the Indian reservations.\u2019 The FBI immediately denied that it had any evidence that the mob was moving into gambling on the reservations. In Connecticut the Governor, Lowell Weicker, who signed the deal whereby the Pequots give $113 million a year to his state, sprang to the tribe\u2019s defence earlier this month, saying he objected more to Mr Trump than he did to casinos. In a rich exchange of insults he said he had come to a \u2018fast conclusion that we don\u2019t need that dirtbag in Connecticut\u2019. Mr Trump, denying he had meant to cast a slur on American Indians, said the Governor was \u2018a fat slob who couldn\u2019t get elected dog-catcher in Connecticut\u2019. Mr Weicker admitted that he might have been a little tough in his language but then added: \u2018I can lose weight a lot faster than a bigot can lose bigotry.\u2019\n\nIn 1992, Trump lost an appeal to overturn a $200,000 penalty for removing black dealers from gaming tables at the request of high rollers, and in 1996 twenty African-Americans in Indiana sued Trump, accusing him of reneging on a promise that he would hire largely minorities for his riverboat casino staff.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a comprehensive list of all the times Donald Trump has been tied to racially charged incidents, nor is it proof that Donald Trump currently harbors racist ideals. The viral meme which circulated in May 2016 claimed that Trump had never been accused of racism before he decided to run against Democrats, and that claim is blatantly false. Trump has been accused of racism by former employees, protesters, committee members, and he has also been the subject of legal action involving anti-discrimination laws.", "lang": "en"}
