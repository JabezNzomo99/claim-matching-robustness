It opened:\n\nMilwaukee, WI | The son of a Milwaukee funeral home owner has been arrested after he allegedly used limbs and several body parts from corpses at his father's business to make himself a customized sex doll. Steven Adams, 38, had been working as a funeral home director for nearly two years after taking over his fathers business at the Adams Sons Funeral Home in Milwaukee. He drew suspicion when authorities exhumed the female body of a 27-year-old cold case victim in the hope of backing up new evidence. Upon exhumation, technicians were shocked to find missing limbs inconsistent with how the victim died. The investigation quickly led to Mr. Adams as the main suspect and a warrant was issued to search his home where authorities found the makeshift sex doll in the basement. The suspect confessed to using a saw to cut limbs off of cadavers and placing them in a plastic bag which he then placed in a backpack before bringing them home where he apparently reassembled them later.\n\nThe story is false, there is no \"Adams Sons Funeral Home\" in Milwaukee, and the site abcnews-us.com has nothing to do with the real ABC News website even though it uses their logo.\n\nThe image used with the story actually came from a report about a different funeral home named Hickory Hill in the Fox Meadows neighbourhood of Memphis, Tennessee which was abandoned with some bodies still inside somewhere in 2016.\n\nThe website abcnews-us.com is a relatively new fake news website. Manic News already ran a little investigation into it and found:\n\nBy looking at some data collected by our Trendolizer engine we were able to confirm the site is indeed also connected to the (now defunct) fake news site cnn-internationaledition.com which we reported on earlier and so it is probably also related to the network of fake news sites that suddenly went offline about a month ago.\n\nEarlier today we also reported that the site was spreading a hoax about marijuana being legalized in Wisconsin and we updated an old report on a hoax about a morgue worker getting accidentally cremated which was also copied by the site (and which used the same Hickory Hill funeral home picture).", "lang": "en"}
