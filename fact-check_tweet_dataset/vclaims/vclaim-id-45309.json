He claimed that the video is from Mumbai and tagged the public body BEST. He later took down his tweet but an archived version can be accessed here.\n\nThe same video has been shared by several other users.\n\nThe clip has been uploaded with a caption in Urdu as well. It has also found its way on YouTube and Facebook.\n\nThe same clip has also been shared as Delhi. A Twitter user wrote, \u201cSee this video Arvind Kejriwal. This is the condition of Delhi\u2019s DTC bus. (\u092f\u0947 \u090f\u0915 \u0935\u0940\u0921\u093f\u092f\u094b \u0926\u0947\u0916 \u0932\u094b @ArvindKejriwal \u0938\u093e\u0939\u092c \u0915\u0940 \u0926\u093f\u0932\u094d\u0932\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u092b\u094d\u0932\u0940\u091f \u092f\u093e\u0928\u0940 \u0915\u093f DTC \u092c\u0938 \u0915\u093e \u0939\u093e\u0932 !!\u201d)\n\nIt is also doing the rounds on Facebook.\n\nIn the background, the conductor of the bus can be heard saying in Bengali, \u201c\u0986\u09b8\u09a4\u09c7 \u0986\u09b8\u09a4\u09c7 \u0986\u09b8\u09a4\u09c7 \u0989\u09a0\u09cb\u09a8 \u0986\u09b8\u09a4\u09c7 \u0989\u09a0\u09cb\u09a8 (Slowly, slowly, slowly, get up slowly).\u201d This is the first hint that the video is not from Maharashtra where Marathi would be used on a local bus. In fact, everyone in the background can only be heard conversing in Bengali.\n\nTwitter handle @nv3sh was one of the earliest to tweet the video. \u201cSee the situation of Kolkata\u2019s bus on 8th June 2020 for yourself. Video by a friend. 2/2,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSpeaking with Alt News, Anvesh (@nv3sh), informed that he does not know who shot the video. However, he had tweeted another video of the same bus before people started to pour in. Commuters can be seen banging on the door of the bus, eager to get in. At 17 seconds in the clip, one can hear the conductor say, \u201c\u099f\u09bf\u099f\u09be\u0997\u09dc \u0985\u09ac\u09cd\u09a6\u09bf \u09af\u09be\u09ac\u09c7, \u09a5\u09be\u09a8\u09be\u09df \u0997\u09be\u09dc\u09bf \u09a2\u09c1\u0995\u09bf\u09df\u09c7 \u09a6\u09c7\u09ac (The bus will go till Titagarh, will take it to the police station.)\u201d Titagarh is a city in North 24 Parganas, West Bengal. It is close to the state capital Kolkata.\n\nA video of people rushing into a bus in West Bengal was therefore shared with the false claim that it is from Mumbai.\n\n[Update: The same video shared as Delhi has been added to this fact-check.]", "lang": "en"}
