{"title": "Analysis | The absurd claim that Trump is the \u2018most pro-gay president in American history\u2019", "subtitle": "Trump loyalist Richard Grenell trashed Joe Biden and touted the president with a stew of misleading timelines, out-of-context quotes and claims easily debunked.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2020-08-24T07:00:27.919Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-57312", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/08/24/absurb-claim-that-trump-is-most-pro-gay-president-american-history/", "vclaim": "This is a ridiculous leap in the timelines. The first sentence refers to a comment made by Biden as a newly elected senator in 1973, nearly half a century ago. He was asked during a neighborhood meeting about anti-gay civil service regulations. \u201cMy gut reaction is that they are security risks, but I must admit I have not given this much thought,\u201d he responded. \u201cI\u2019ll be darned!\u201d (Note that while Grenell asserts that Biden spoke about security clearances, the question was about civil service regulations.)\n\nGrenell portrays his three-month, temporary Cabinet-level appointment as a signature moment in the gay rights movement. But it was also highly controversial, even among Republicans, given that Grenell was considered a hyperpartisan GOP operative who had little experience in intelligence matters. \u201cAs one of the four authors of the law that created the DNI back in 2004, I care deeply about that position and believe the person needs experience in the intelligence community, which regrettably Ambassador Grenell does not have,\u201d Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said after Trump appointed Grenell.\n\nAgain, Grenell mixes up timelines and facts to confuse viewers. The \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d policy was a Clinton administration rule adopted in 1993. Bill Clinton had hoped to lift a ban on gays in the military but was forced by Congress to accept a weak compromise under which military applicants were not asked about sexual orientation but still could be kicked out of the military if they were discovered to be gay. Biden was one of 33 senators who opposed inserting the compromise language in a must-pass defense bill and instead wanted to allow the president to set the policy. When that amendment failed, he still voted for the overall bill.\n\nNotice Grenell\u2019s sleight of hand here? He suggests Biden switched on same-sex marriage only because others had already done so. Instead, Biden was the highest-ranking official at the time to endorse same-sex marriage when few others had done so. Earlier, between 2000 and 2009, Biden had voted to block constitutional amendments to ban same-sex marriage, co-sponsored bills that would have prohibited employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and was an original co-sponsor of the Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act, later signed into law by Obama. (Shepard\u2019s parents spoke at this month\u2019s Democratic National Convention.)\n\nHere Grenell suggests policy toward Iran is based on Tehran\u2019s anti-homosexual policies when nothing could be further from the truth; it\u2019s mostly about Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Trump has sought to dismantle the nuclear accord reached by Obama but has made no progress in reaching a new agreement. We have explained many times what Iran received under the accord was Iranian money frozen in overseas accounts; Obama did not \u201cgive\u201d its leaders billions of dollars because it was always Iran\u2019s money.\n\n\u201cPlain and simple, Donald Trump has attacked LGBTQ people because of who we are and whom we love,\u201d Lucas Acosta, HRC national press secretary, said in a statement to The Fact Checker. \u201cHis administration has sought to allow discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in health care, in employment and foster care, in schools, and even in housing. It\u2019s unconscionable, insidious, and offensive for anyone to call this administration \u2018pro-LGBTQ\u2019 when the president, vice president, and those who work for them, have endeavored to systematically roll back our rights and deny us our dignity. The 11 million LGBTQ voters and 57 million voters who prioritize equality when casting their vote are not going to fall for the Trump campaign\u2019s latest attempt to gas light the American public.\u201d\n\nThe Advocate, an LGBT-interest magazine, said it gave Biden an \u201centhusiastic\u201d endorsement because \u201cBiden is running on the most pro-LGBTQ+ platform of any major-party nominee in the history of the United States.\u201d The endorsement discusses some of the votes cited by Grenell but says they must be viewed in context. \u201cYou can not have had a career in politics as long as Biden without evolving on a lot of issues along with broader society,\u201d the Advocate wrote.", "lang": "en"}
