Yet here is Donald Trump, in his major foreign-policy address, referring to an incident \u201cwithout precedent\u201d\u2014 that the president of the United States flew to another country and there was \u201cno leader\u201d to greet him.\n\nThe State Department historian just lists presidential travel (which, by the way, is missing the last two years). White House officials also said they did not have a central listing, but said there have been a number of trips when the head of state or government chose not to greet the president at the airport.\n\n\u201cIt is not at all uncommon for the president \u2026 not to participate in ceremonial arrival ceremonies with heads of state when he arrives at the airport,\u201d said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. He said it was not regarded as a snub.\n\nWe decided to double-check this by examining numerous photographs of arrival ceremonies and the pool reports written by reporters traveling with the president. Gawker has posted many pool reports from the past year, and we collected others that had been in our email traffic.\n\nSo here we have the foreign minister (who is not a member of the royal family) and the governor of Riyadh, who is a royal. But not the king. As far as we can tell, Obama was greeted at the airport by King Salman or his predecessor King Abdullah on his earlier visits \u2014 as was President George W. Bush. So maybe the Saudis \u2014 known to be unhappy with the international agreement on Iran\u2019s nuclear program \u2014 were sending a signal.\n\nBut if Trump is suggesting these greetings by lower-level officials were \u201cwithout precedent,\u201d he\u2019s really off base. We found numerous examples of when the president was not greeted by a head of state or government, though obviously there were also other times when he was greeted by a fellow leader.\n\nOn Obama\u2019s recent trip to Germany, the most senior German to greet the plane was Ambassador Jurgen Mertens, chief of protocol at the Federal Foreign Office. When Obama arrived in London, there was just a very small party: The Lord Petre, Her Majesty\u2019s Lord-Lieutenant of Essex, along with the U.S. ambassador and his wife. Presidential trips in 2014 and 2015 to Belgium, Turkey, Burma, Estonia, France and Jamaica also involved tarmac greetings by lower-level officials.\n\nOur favorite example is a trip to Panama in 2015, when Obama was greeted by Alvaro Aleman, minister of the presidency. Then Obama and Aleman walked together down the red carpet, and Obama was greeted by a group of children: Stefan Varela, the president\u2019s son; Felipe Duboy, son of a minister; Julio Alvarado, the vice president\u2019s son; and Ana Hincapie, the deputy foreign minister\u2019s daughter.\n\nWhile it did not seem worth cataloging every presidential trip, we did spot check some previous presidents. Trump referred to \u201cour great president\u201d Ronald Reagan, but he might be surprised to learn that even Reagan was sometimes not greeted at the airport by other leaders.\n\nIn a 1984 trip to China, Reagan landed in Beijing and received what was described as a low-key welcome by Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian. In a 1985 trip to West Germany, Reagan was met by Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, not Chancellor Helmut Kohl. And in 1988, when Reagan traveled to Moscow to meet with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, he was greeted at the airport by the far less powerful president, Andrei A. Gromyko.\n\nFinally, one of the most famous presidential trips overseas should be noted. In 1972, President Richard Nixon visited China, a trip that launched a historic diplomatic thaw after years of icy relations between the two countries. (Interesting historical oddity: The communist government insisted that only Chinese pilots could fly Air Force One into Beijing. The White House, amazingly, agreed to this unusual demand.)\n\nWe don\u2019t know where Trump comes up with this stuff, but once again he\u2019s wrong, wrong, wrong. Not every tarmac greeting for the president overseas involves a fellow leader; in fact, the airport ceremony is a relatively unimportant part of the trip. The real business is done in the formal meetings.", "lang": "en"}
