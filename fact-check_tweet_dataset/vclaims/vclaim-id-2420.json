In discussing \u201cour tax proposal,\u201d the president said he wanted to cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent and lower individual income taxes.\n\n\u201cAnd the rich will not be gaining at all with this plan,\u201d Trump added, promising instead that his plan would benefit the \u201cmiddle class.\u201d\n\nOf course things may change, but the Trump administration released a one-page outline in April that included these major tax changes:\n\u2022 Abolish the estate tax, which now falls only on those with assets worth more than $5.49 million (double that for couples).\n\u2022 Cut the corporate tax from 35 percent to 15 percent. As we have written before, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that 75 percent of the corporate tax burden falls on investors.\n\u2022 Abolish the alternative minimum tax, which is designed to ensure that the most wealthy taxpayers pay a minimum tax.\n\u2022 Collapse the seven income tax brackets, which range from 10 percent to 39.6 percent, to three (10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent).\n\nIn July, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated the impact of a \u201cTrump-like plan.\u201d Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the tax center, wrote that middle-income households (those earning between $50,000 and $86,000) would see an average tax cut of about $1,900 or about 3 percent. But the top 1 percent (those earning more than $732,000) would get an average tax cut of $270,000 or nearly 18 percent, and the top 0.1 percent would see a 20 percent tax cut.\n\n\u201cForty percent of the benefits would go to the top 1 percent,\u201d Gleckman wrote.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center analysis comes with the big caveat that the administration did not at the time \u2014 and has not since \u2014 provided enough details for a more precise estimate.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said that the administration supports ending all \u201cloopholes,\u201d except those for home mortgages and charitable giving \u2014 so the Tax Policy Center analysis takes that into account. But the administration has not specified income ranges for the proposed income tax brackets, so the center\u2019s analysis had to estimate where the three proposed brackets might begin and end.\n\nAlso, the administration is in discussions with Republican leaders that will likely result in changes to Trump\u2019s tax plan.\n\nFor example, the New York Times has reported that the administration is considering leaving the top bracket at 39.6 percent, rather than cutting it to 35 percent.\n\nAlso, House Speaker Paul Ryan has said that cutting the corporate tax rate to \u201cthe mid to low 20s\u201d is more \u201cachievable\u201d than 15 percent. But at the Sept. 13 meeting, Trump repeated that \u201cwe want a 15 percent rate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at a 15 percent rate,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd we want a 15 percent rate because that would bring us low \u2014 not by any means the lowest \u2014 but it would bring us to a level where China and other countries are. And we will be able to compete with anybody. Nobody will be able to touch us. So we would like to see 15 percent.\u201d\n\nRoberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center told us there is \u201cno evidence\u201d that Trump and Republican leaders will abandon \u201call of the tax cuts that benefit the rich\u201d in Trump\u2019s plan. He added that any effort to merely scale back the tax plan will still benefit the wealthy.\n\n\u201cRetaining the 39.6% top individual tax rate would limit tax savings for high-income people but they would still benefit from the cuts in lower rates. And any cut in the corporate tax rate would disproportionately favor the rich \u2014 they bear most of the burden of that tax and any cut would help them. Just because the rate cut would be smaller doesn\u2019t mean they wouldn\u2019t benefit \u2014 they\u2019d just benefit less,\u201d Williams said in an email.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve seen nothing to indicate that the plan would retain either the estate tax or the AMT, two things that hit higher-income households hardest,\u201d Williams added.\n\nGleckman, of the Tax Policy Center, ended his July analysis of the Trump-like plan by writing: \u201cWhile we don\u2019t know what tax plan the president will propose in the coming months, it would have to look very different from what we\u2019ve seen so far to avoid adding trillions of dollars to the debt and heavily skewing its benefits to the highest-income households.\u201d\n\nIn an email, Gleckman told us that nothing has changed since then.\n\n\u201cIn sum,\u201d Gleckman said, \u201cTrump would have to radically restructure what he\u2019s proposed in the past for it to not benefit high-income households.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
