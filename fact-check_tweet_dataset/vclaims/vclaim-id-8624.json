China retaliated with equal tariffs on $34 billion in U.S. goods, including on soybeans, wheat, corn, sorghum and beef. The trade war has only escalated since.\n\nIt was during a U.N. Security Council meeting on counterproliferation in New York that Trump made his accusation about China.\n\nAt a press conference after the Security Council meeting, a reporter asked Trump if he has evidence of his \u201csignificant allegation\u201d that China is meddling in the 2018 U.S. elections.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s what I hear,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have evidence. We have evidence. It will come out. I can\u2019t tell you now, but it didn\u2019t come out of nowhere, that I can tell you.\u201d\n\nThe president then went on to complain that China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs were targeting his supporters. \u201cThey actually admitted that they are going after farmers,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAt another point, the president said, \u201cOne thing that they are trying to do is convince people to go against Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, the president tweeted about a four-page supplement in the Des Moines Register that was purchased by China Daily, a Chinese government-run media outlet. His tweet (see below) showed a headline that reads, \u201cDuel undermines benefits of trade.\u201d\n\nIt is not unusual for foreign countries or state-owned media outlets to run advertising supplements in U.S. newspapers. China Daily regularly runs supplements in U.S. papers, including the Washington Post and New York Times.\n\nIn a news story about the newspaper ad in Iowa, the Des Moines Register quoted David Skidmore, a political science professor at Drake University, as saying the ad campaign is designed \u201cto change its trade policies toward China by attempting to show White House and Republicans that they\u2019re going to pay a price with the mid-terms.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time that Trump has accused China of interfering in the upcoming midterm elections. He has also accused the country of imposing tariffs on products in states that Trump won during the 2016 election. On Sept. 18, Trump issued two tweets complaining that China\u2019s tariffs are targeting \u201cour farmers, ranchers and industrial workers because of their loyalty to me.\u201d\n\nTrump has complained about China\u2019s public relations campaign against tariffs before. On Aug. 4, the president tweeted that China \u201cis spending a fortune on ads and P.R. trying to convince and scare our politicians to fight me on Tariffs.\u201d\n\nIt is worth noting that China Daily is registered as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, since at least 1983.\n\nIn its earliest filing available online, China Daily says that part of its agreement with China is to obtain \u201cpaid advertisements in the U.S. & Canada for inclusion in the newspaper.\u201d In its most recent filing in May, China Daily reported that it had \u201cadvertising campaigns\u201d in the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal in the previous six months.\n\nBut the paid advertisements, the publicly registered lobbying reports and retaliatory tariffs are all different than the kind of extensive covert election interference that Russia engaged in during the 2016 election.\n\nDuring the 2016 election, Russian intelligence agents hacked into the email systems of the Democratic Party and its officials, secretly directed the release of the hacked material, and engaged in a social media influence campaign \u2014 all \u201cto help President-elect Trump\u2019s election chances,\u201d according to a U.S. intelligence report released in January 2017.\n\nIn February, the special counsel\u2019s office investigating Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election indicted three Russian organizations and 13 Russian nationals for conspiring to violate U.S. election laws and defraud the United States. The conspiracy involved using the names of U.S. citizens and entities to illegally buy political ads on social media and stage political rallies. Some defendants also \u201csolicited and compensated real U.S. persons to promote or disparage candidates,\u201d according to the indictment.\n\nIn July, Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, announced the indictment of 12 members of GRU, a Russian military intelligence agency. The GRU officers \u201cengaged in a sustained effort to hack into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the Democratic National Committee, and the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, and released that information on the internet under the names \u2018DCLeaks\u2019 and \u2018Guccifer 2.0\u2019 and through another entity,\u201d a Justice Department press release says.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if the president has any evidence of a covert operation by China.\n\nAt an Aug. 2 briefing, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said \u201cour intelligence shows that there are a number of others that are looking at and considering engaging, particularly in 2018.\u201d But she declined to offer specifics at the time and the White House press office did not answer our questions about Trump\u2019s latest accusation.", "lang": "en"}
