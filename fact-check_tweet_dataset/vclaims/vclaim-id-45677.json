The posts claim the image shows one of Thondaman\u2019s daughters violated Sri Lanka's mandatory coronavirus quarantine policy for travelers by attending the ceremony shortly after returning to the country from overseas. The claim is false; the image shows Thondaman\u2019s other daughter, who resides in Sri Lanka and did not travel from abroad to attend the funeral.\n\nThe photo was published on Facebook here on May 31, 2020. It has been shared more than 1,500 times.\n\nThe post's Sinhala-language caption translates to English as: \u201cOur own brothers and sisters who worked hard to earn dollars are dying.\n\n\u201cThis woman has returned from abroad, no quarantine laws applied, straight to the funeral\n\n\u201cTwo laws in the same country\u201d.\n\nThe post refers to Thondaman\u2019s first daughter Nachiar Thondaman, who resides in Oman.\n\nThe same photo was shared alongside a similar claim on Facebook here, here, here and here.\n\nThe woman featured in the image is in fact Viji Thondaman, the late politician's other daughter who did not travel from abroad to attend the funeral on May 31, 2020.\n\n\u201cThe claim made in these posts are false,\" Thondaman\u2019s son Jeevan Thondaman told AFP by phone on June 2, 2020.\n\n\"This is my sister Viji who resides in Sri Lanka. She was alongside me throughout events in Colombo as well, held to pay respects to my late father,\u201d he said.\n\nJeevan added: \u201cMy older sister Nachiar, who resides in Oman, returned to Sri Lanka the day after my father\u2019s death. But she never got to attend the funeral due to the mandatory quarantine process.\"\n\nMathan A P, the editor of the Tamil Mirror, covered the funeral proceedings for his Tamil-language newspaper and also confirmed that the photo shared in the misleading posts shows Viji -- not Nachiyar.\n\n\u201cOnly his son Jeevan and the second daughter Viji attended the event on May 31 and this picture is of Viji,\u201d he told AFP by phone on June 2, 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the image in the misleading posts (L); and a photograph of the two daughters, with Viji on the right (R):", "lang": "en"}
