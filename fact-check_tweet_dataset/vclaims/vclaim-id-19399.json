The warning claims that 2-4 lakh members of the Muslim community have gathered near Talkatora stadium and blocked roads in Central Delhi. It alerts people to stay safe.\n\nThe full message reads \u2013 \u201cPls, to all\u2026..

So, pls BE CAREFUL & DONT VENTURE OUT to Central Delhi\u2026.. as a safety measure.\u201d\n\nThe warning has also been circulated on WhatsApp along with a video.\n\nThe video can be watched below.\n\nProtest against mob lynchings, NOT \u2018Show of Strength\u2019 rally\n\nAlt News contacted Delhi police to enquire if a \u2018Muslim Ekta Show of Strength\u2019 rally was organised near Talkatora stadium. The police informed that no such procession was taken out but a protest against mob lynchings was held on August 5 near the stadium.\n\nTaking this as a hint, we looked for news reports with specific keywords and found that Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind had organised \u2018Aman Ekta Sammelan\u2019 at Talkatora stadium to protest mob lynchings. According to a Times of Indiareport, the rally was held the day after the government stripped Jammu and Kashmir of its special status by diluting Article 370. The protestors demanded the enactment of a stringent law against mob lynchings. The report furthered that leaders of other minority faiths also participated in the rally. The event was also reported by Business Standard, Caravan Dailyand The Week.\n\nJamiat Ulama-i-Hind also provided details of the protest on its website.\n\nAlt News found several videos of \u2018Aman Ekta Sammelan\u2019 online. The photomontage below shows Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind flags visible in the viral video and protest videos on YouTube and Facebook.\n\nAnother clue which linked the viral video to the protest rally near Talkatora stadium is a signboard which we found upon watching the video in slow motion. The board reads \u2013 \u2018Mandir Marg\u2019 \u2013 which is an area barely a kilometre from the stadium.\n\nWhile the event did cause traffic snarls in Central Delhi, it was not a \u2018Show of Strength\u2019 rally organised by members of the Mulsim community. The viral video represents a protest march organised by Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind on August 5 against mob lynchings.", "lang": "en"}
