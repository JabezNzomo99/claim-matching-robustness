(Kris Aquino rushed to hospital after testing positive for COV...),\u201d the last word suggesting she has been infected with the viral disease that has killed hundreds of thousands around the world.\n\nGl0beupdatingn3ws.xyz also duped readers with 19-month-old photos and a video of Aquino in a hospital bed, to support its fake claim.\n\nAquino, who leads a very public life, has not mentioned in any of her social media accounts that she is sick or is hospitalized and neither has any legitimate media organization reported this.\n\nA reverse image search shows one of the images in the hoax\u2019s thumbnail was uploaded on the actress\u2019 Instagram account on Jan. 10, 2019 while the other was a screengrab from a video she posted the next day. Both showed her in a hospital in Singapore. In a separate Instagram post, Aquino said she was getting tested at the time for two autoimmune disorders.\n\nGl0beupdatingn3ws.xyz\u2019s thumbnail also carried a portrait of Aquino published that month.\n\nFor its content, the website embedded a video that only plays for three seconds. An online search for the clip shows it was a cut version of a Jan. 10, 2019 News 5 report on Aquino being confined in a Singaporean hospital.\n\nOnce the clip stops playing, an overlay pops up that invites viewers to share the story first on Facebook (FB) to continue watching. The same happens in other clickbait hoaxes that VERA Files Fact Check has debunked in the past. (See: VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Imposter \u2018BBC, ABS-CBN\u2019 FB page posts death HOAX on Ironman star and VERA FILES FACT CHECK: No, Piolo Pascual was NOT killed by carjackers).\n\nThe edited video used by website gl0beupdatingn3ws.xyz was uploaded by YouTube channel Aksyon Balita PH, which spuriously carried the logo of GMA News as its display picture. A look at its uploads shows it has published at least 10 other fake \u201cdeath\u201d reports, as well as sex scandals and crime videos.\n\nGl0beupdatingn3ws.xyz\u2019s fabricated story could have reached over three million people, according to social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle, with traffic largely coming from FB group JOEY DE LEON.\n\nAccording to Facebook, the hoax surfaced on Aug. 20, a day before the 37th anniversary of the assassination of Aquino\u2019s father\u2014Marcos critic and former senator Benigno \u201cNinoy\u201d Aquino Jr.\n\nWebsite gl0beupdatingn3ws.xyz was created only last July 7 while YouTube channel Aksyon Balita PH was created on Aug. 26, 2019.", "lang": "en"}
