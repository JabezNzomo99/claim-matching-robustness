He is reportedly in \u201cserious\u201d condition with \u201c70% lung damage.\u201d\n\nKadyrov has made bizarre statements about the coronavirus, including a claim that those infected were possessed by the devil and a warning that Chechens who violated the quarantine would be buried alive.\n\nAs of this writing, the Kremlin has issued no official confirmation or denial about Kadyrov. In Chechnya\u2019s capital Grozny, the Ministry of Information and Press, which acts as Kadyrov\u2019s press office, did not respond to media inquiries.\n\nHowever, a few hours after the reports about Kadyrov\u2019s health problems emerged, Chechnya\u2019s minister of information, Djambulat Umarov posted on Instagram a picture of his boss labeled: \u201cIs it true that I..? Don\u2019t hold your breath!\u201d\n\nThe post\u2019s caption appears to quote Kadyrov mocking journalists, saying: \u201cHow much the journalists love making all kinds of prognosis!\u201d and \u201c[W]hen I am silent, they take offense, but it\u2019s nothing personal. It\u2019s just I\u2019m silent when I\u2019m thinking.\u201d\n\nSome foreign reporters in Russia cited the Instagram post in questioning whether Kadyrov was really in Moscow for COVID-19 treatment.\n\nIn the photo, Kadyrov has a full head of hair, while in his most recent public appearances, he has been bald.\n\nOn April 21, Kadyrov posted a video of himself on social media saying that he had shaved his head in response to demands that hair salons in Chechnya, which were closed due to the COVID-19 restrictions, be reopened. He urged others to follow his lead and shave their heads. And follow they did.\n\nThe reports of Kadyrov\u2019s hospitalization in Moscow have appeared in Russian state media, which cited other news reports, not official sources. However, Interfax.ru cited an anonymous Russian health official confirming that Kadyrov is indeed under \u201cmedical observation\u201d in Moscow for \u201csuspected coronavirus\u201d infection.\n\nEarlier reports suggested that Chechnya\u2019s health minister, Elkhan Suleimanov, and Kadyrov\u2019s assistant, Akhmed Dudaev, were hospitalized in Moscow along with their boss. Late Thursday, May 21, both Suleimanov and Dudaev denied the reports, saying they were in Grozny and not infected.\n\nSpeaking with Russia\u2019s TASS state news agency, Dudaev did not directly answer questions about Kadyrov\u2019s hospitalization, saying only that the Chechen government\u2019s anti-coronavirus center was continuing to work \u201cunder his personal control.\u201d\n\nSince the outbreak of COVID-19, Kadyrov, a loyal supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has made contradictory statements about the virus.\n\nIn a public broadcast on March 13, during the early stages of the pandemic, he advised his ministers to drink a mix of honey and lemon and eat garlic to combat the virus.\n\nOn March 17, Chechnya, like the rest of Russia, imposed a quarantine on Putin\u2019s orders.\n\nOn March 23, Chechnya reported its first three COVID-19 cases. A day earlier Kadyrov had said on Chechen TV that people infected with coronavirus are \u201cshaitans\u201d - i.e., possessed by Satan - and that death was an \u201cappropriate punishment\u201d for them.\n\nOn March 26, Kadyrov again went on TV, this time saying that if people suspected of being infected with COVID-19 violated the quarantine, even to seek medical help, they should be treated like terrorists -- thrown in a hole, sealed in with no food and no water, and left to die.\n\nOn April 3, Kadyrov imposed a republic-wide 8 a.m.-8 p.m. curfew on all pedestrians and vehicles except those providing emergency medical and government services.\n\nThe independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported on April 12 that people had taken Kadyrov\u2019s threats about being infected with COVID-19 seriously and chose to silently die at home rather than test positive and face punishment by the authorities.\n\nThe next day, Kadyrov went live on his now blocked Instagram account and urged Russia\u2019s security services and the Kremlin to prevent \u201cthese animals\u201d like Novaya Gazeta from writing about \u201cmy republic!\u201d\n\nThe Russian government media watchdog Roscomnadzor responded by ordering the Novaya Gazeta article removed from the newspaper\u2019s website. A heavily edited version of the piece was later reposted with an editorial note explaining that the content has been redacted in compliance with orders from a prosecutor.\n\nThe author of the Novaya Gazeta piece, Elena Milashina, said in a May 21 post that she would move all her Chechnya reporting to Facebook.\n\n\u201cDue to rather difficult circumstances, all my publications about Chechnya will now be here. On my FB page,\u201d she wrote. \u201cPublishing them anywhere creates a risk for the platform that hosts them. But not speaking about what is happening in Chechnya is not an option either.\u201d\n\nWhile reporting from Chechnya, Milashina was physically attacked on several occasions. She also says she received direct death threats from Kadyrov.\n\nCritics say that Kadyrov, in his response to the coronavirus pandemic, has focused entirely on restrictive measures, rather than aiding the health system. After two devastating wars with Russia in 1994 and 2000, Chechnya has massive public health problems and lacks proper medical care and professionals.\n\nOn April 14, a group of Chechen doctors complained about the lack of personal protective equipment. Immediately afterwards, they apologized on state TV.", "lang": "en"}
