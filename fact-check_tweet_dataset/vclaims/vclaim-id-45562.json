This image did not appear in an episode of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and it was posted to Pomo\u2019s Instagram account on May 30, five days after Floyd\u2019s death.\n\nNormally you\u2019re used to see colorful and cheerful drawings from me, but since i\u2019ve got quite a good audience, i\u2019d like to use it as much as i can in the right way when the situation requires it, and bring something good, and useful with my drawings, and you guys know it. Especially in this exact moment. With this piece i\u2019d like you to think deeply, Taking the chance to bring The Simpsons as an example for the cause. The Simpsons has always been everyone\u2019s childhood, so the message will be clear and strong enough i suppose. Imagine you\u2019re sat with you daughter/son watching the Simpsons, and all of a sudden this scene happens in the show, as cruel as it has been, no jokes, no irony, nothing that the Simpsons normally has, and what it\u2019s loved for. Imagine that, how would you feel? \u2026 Think about that deeply, and give yourself an answer, no need to add anything else!\n\nThe above-displayed collage also implies that \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d predicted that a police station would be lit on fire.\n\nAlthough a precinct in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was truly set ablaze, the image in this collection does not show that fire. The photograph in the bottom left corner of this collection actually shows an unfinished housing complex. That photograph is available via The Associated Press and captioned as follows:\n\nThe image on the top left, showing the Springfield police station on fire, truly does come from an episode of \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d However, this image has nothing to do with protests, riots, George Floyd, or police violence. Instead, it refers to a joke \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d made about police incompetence.\n\nIn the episode \u201cHello Gutter, Hello Fadder\u201d (Season 11, Episode 6), Homer decides to bypass traffic by driving along the grassy area next to the highway. He is pulled over by Springfield\u2019s Police Chief Wiggum, who asks: \u201cAlright smart guy, where\u2019s the fire?\u201d\n\nHomer replies \u201cover there\u201d and points to a flaming Springfield police station. Chief Wiggum responds: \u201cOkay, you just bought yourself a 317, pointing out police stupidity\u2026 Or is that a 314? Nah nah, 314 is a dog uh, in, no or is that a 315?\u2026 You\u2019re in trouble pal.\u201d\n\nWe have not been able to find a publicly available version of this clip to share in this article, but here\u2019s a GIF capturing the moment:\n\nIn sum, \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d didn\u2019t predict Floyd\u2019s death or the resulting protests or fires. The image of Chief Wiggum kneeling on a black man\u2019s neck was shared in the days after Floyd\u2019s death and didn\u2019t appear in an official episode of the show. Although the image of the Springfield police station burning did come from an episode of \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d this clip had nothing to do with Floyd or the 2020 protests.", "lang": "en"}
