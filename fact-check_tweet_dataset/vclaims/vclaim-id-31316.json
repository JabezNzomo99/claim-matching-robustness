But the videos are misleading -- they only show a brief excerpt of Atanga Nji\u2019s speech. In the full version, it is clear that Atanga Nji is demanding an apology from armed separatist groups, not apologising himself.\n\nCameroon\u2019s anglophone regions, in the northwest and southwest of the country, have suffered repeated clashes between the military and armed separatist groups since October 2017. More than 2,000 people have been killed, according to Human Rights Watch, while the UN estimates that more than 530,000 people have been forced to leave their homes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019m sorry to have killed innocent Cameroonians. I\u2019m sorry to have raped young girls. I\u2019m sorry to have committed atrocities. But God almighty, forgive me,\u201d Atanga Nji is seen saying in the 13-second video clip.\n\nVarious Facebook users shared the clip in posts that suggested it truly showed Atanga Nji, Cameroon\u2019s minister for territorial administration, making an apology.\n\n\u201cWhat a horrible confession from Atanga Nji paul in broad day light,\u201d read the caption on one post which we\u2019ve archived here.\n\n\u201cAtango finally confesses to his crimes,\u201d read another. A third said it showed Atanga Nji confessing \u201cfor killing civilians\u201d. The video clip is also circulating in French-language posts, including here and here.\n\nWhat Atanga Nji actually said\n\nSome social media users correctly pointed out that Atanga Nji\u2019s remarks had been cut short to make it look like he was issuing an apology. On Facebook, one user shared a link to a longer version of the speech which makes it clear that he is in fact demanding an apology from armed separatist groups.\n\nYou can find this longer version of his speech, lasting one minute and 32 seconds, here on the Facebook page of national television station CRTV. This longer clip makes it clear that Atanga Nji is demanding an apology, not making one himself.\n\nHere\u2019s a transcript from the 50-second mark: \u201cThose who are still in the bushes have the possibility to repent. And if you want to repent, then (President) Paul Biya is giving you this branch of peace. This branch of peace, that you should put down your weapons and talk to the local administrative authorities. The prime minister, the head of government was here (from May 10-12), he gave the same message: put down your weapons and go meet the local admin authorities. Tell them that, \u2018I\u2019m sorry for what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019m sorry to have killed innocent Cameroonians. I\u2019m sorry to have raped young girls. I\u2019m sorry to have committed atrocities. But God almighty, forgive me.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe misleading posts about his comments come at a time when the Cameroonian government is preparing for a \u201cnational dialogue,\u201d starting next Monday, aimed at finding a way out of the crisis.\n\nWhile several anglophone leaders have welcomed the initative, most separatists have indicated that they will not take part.", "lang": "en"}
