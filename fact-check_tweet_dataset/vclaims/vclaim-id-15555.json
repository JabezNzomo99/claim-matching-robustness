People of Wayanad understood in four days but the sycophants couldn't recognize him yet...you know, right, that Kerala has a literacy rate of 100 per cent. Look at the honor meted out Mister Rahul Gandu. This is not me but the poster says so.'\n\nThe post is also viral from several Twitter handles.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nHowever, the claim in itself is an immediate giveaway to the authenticity of the post being doubtful. The the post suggests that this is a campaign poster in Kerala, but the photos on the poster are of prominent Congress leaders of Telangana.\n\nWhile the upper right side of the poster has a photo of Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee's president N Uttam Kumar Reddy, the bottom right side has a photo of Congress leader D Sudheer Reddy.\n\nThis makes it clear that the poster is not from Kerala.\n\nThis is not the first time that the image has gone viral, in 2018, the same image was circulated on the internet with a different caption. However, the claim back then was that the poster was from Telangana.\n\nBOOM found a video on YouTube by a channel called 'B News'. which had debunked the same fake post on August 22, 2018.\n\nThe video shows the original poster where the Congress president's name is spelt correctly. The hoarding is from Rangareddy district of Telangana as we can see 'Rangareddy District Congress Committee' written on another poster displayed nearby.\n\nBOOM also found a video uploaded on the official Facebook page of Sudheer Reddy which shows the same poster, but with Gandhi's name spelled correctly. The video was uploaded on August 15, 2018. The caption with the video also talks about the morphed poster.\n\nBOOM reached out to Sudheer Reddy, the story will be updated upon receiving a reply.", "lang": "en"}
