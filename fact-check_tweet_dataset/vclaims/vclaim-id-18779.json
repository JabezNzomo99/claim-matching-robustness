The video is more than five months old.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be baseless.\n\nThe video, posted on March 3, has been shared more than 39,000 times till the time of filing this story. The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nThe Pakistani YouTuber used an old bogus video of Facebook user Avi Dandiya\u2019 as proof to support his claim. Several fact checkers, including India Today, had earlier debunked it. The audio recording used by Avi Dandiya\u2019 was doctored.\n\nThe 11-minute video of Doctor Turki\u2019 begins with a long rant, where he is spewing venom against PM Modi. He claims that an audio recording of Modi has been leaked which confirms that the PM is the mastermind behind the Pulwama attack.\n\nHe then plays a video of well-known Facebook user Avi Dandiya\u2019 who asks people to listen to an audio clip.\n\nThe audio is a conversation, purportedly between an unidentified woman and two Union ministers. The conversation between the trio seems to be on planning an attack on Indian soldiers to arouse patriotic sentiments in the country.\n\nThe YouTuber then targets Indian media for running a photo-shopped\u2019 image as the mastermind of the Pulwama attack. He also played a video clip of Wing Commander Abhinandan in the custody of Pakistani forces and appealed Indian people to throw Modi out of power.\n\nOn March 1, 2019, Avi Dandiya\u2019 appeared on Facebook Live and played an audio conversation between a woman and two BJP ministers, which was later found to be doctored by fact checkers such as Alt News and India Today.\n\nThe audio was made after joining together bits and pieces of various speeches and interviews of Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh.\n\nThe Pakistani YouTuber has used a portion of Dandiya\u2019s fake video and claimed it to be Modi\u2019s leaked audio recording on Pulwama. Dandiya claims to be a non-resident Indian whose Facebook page has more than 2.8 lakh followers.\n\nPakistani YouTuber Doctor Turki\u2019 has a huge fan following on YouTube and Facebook.\n\nHe is running his YouTube channel from 2017 and has a subscriber base of more than five lakh people. He runs his YouTube channel from Saudi Arabia. Most of his videos are targeted against Modi and anti-Indian in nature.\n\nDoctor Turki\u2019s post is misleading as he has used another doctored video to substantiate his claim.\n\nBut he was partially correct when he blamed Indian media for using a photo-shopped image of a foreign soldier as the Pulwama mastermind. This was wrongly used by several mainstream media but later rectified.", "lang": "en"}
