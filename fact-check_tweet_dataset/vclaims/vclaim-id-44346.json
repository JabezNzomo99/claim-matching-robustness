This is false; Canadian health and federal police officials say it has no factual basis, and experts say evidence indicates the virus has a natural origin.\n\n\u201cCorona virus developed in Canada and stolen by China?\u201d reads the headline of this article from January 22, 2020. It appears to be the first of a series of such claims about the novel coronavirus, which caused an outbreak in the central Chinese city of Wuhan before spreading elsewhere in the country and around the world.\n\nOther social media users soon shared similar versions of the claim, referring to the investigation of two Chinese virologists in Canada in 2019. Kyle Bass, an American hedge fund manager who is currently shorting Hong Kong\u2019s currency, falsely claimed on Twitter that a \u201cChinese spy team\u201d sent pathogens \u201cto the Wuhan facility.\u201d He was retweeted 12,500 times, and screenshots of the tweet were shared on Facebook.\n\nThe claims appear to be based on a mischaracterization of August 2019 reports about a transfer of Ebola and Nipah viruses from a Canadian lab to Beijing, and an apparently separate issue involving two Chinese researchers at Canada\u2019s National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg, in the central province of Manitoba.\n\nThe NML is part of the federal Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), whose senior media officer Tammy Jarbeau told AFP by email that \u201cthis is disinformation. (These) statements made on social networks have no factual basis.\u201d\n\nIn July 2019, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that two researchers with ties to China were removed from the NML in Winnipeg by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) for a possible \u201cpolicy breach.\u201d The article did not mention the coronavirus.\n\nRobert Cyrenne, spokesman for the RCMP in Manitoba, told AFP by email that \u201cthere is no connection between the outbreak in China and any RCMP investigation. Any reporting of such is misinformation.\u201d\n\nCyrenne confirmed to AFP that the investigation involving the researchers is still ongoing.\n\nDr Xiangguo Qiu, who helped develop a treatment for the Ebola virus, her husband Keding Cheng, a biologist who has published papers on coronavirus strains such as SARS-CoV, and Chinese students working under them had their security access revoked for Canada\u2019s only level-4 lab, a facility equipped for research on the deadliest diseases.\n\nClaims that the novel coronavirus was created in Canada refer to another report involving the NML. One month after Qiu, Cheng and the students were escorted off premises, CBC reported that live Ebola and Nipah viruses had been shipped to Beijing in March 2019 for research.\n\nPHAC officials told CBC that all procedures were followed for the shipment of those level-4 pathogens, the deadliest. But the short interval between the Air Canada flight they were transported on and Qiu and Cheng\u2019s removal led to suspicion that the two events could be connected.\n\nThe RCMP declined to comment on any potential connection between the investigation and the virus shipment to Beijing.\n\nBass\u2019s tweet claims that Qiu was suspended for sending pathogens to Wuhan. In fact, the two pathogens were sent to Beijing, and were not coronaviruses.\n\nThe University of Manitoba, with which Qiu and Cheng were affiliated, has ended their non-salaried appointments and re-assigned the students working with them, a spokesperson told the Canadian Press.\n\nThe RCMP did not comment on the current whereabouts of Qiu and Cheng for privacy reasons.\n\nIn a letter published on February 19, 2020 in The Lancet medical journal, a group of public health scientists made a statement about the origins of the novel coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 disease.\n\n\u201cWe stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin. Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife, as have so many other emerging pathogens,\u201d they said.\n\nA team of scientists led by Shan-Lu Liu of The Ohio State University also concluded that there is no \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that the virus -- officially known as SARS-CoV-2 -- was engineered in a laboratory, in research published on February 26, 2020.\n\nAccording to the Canadian government, as of March 24, 2020, there were 1,959 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infection across the country. Twenty-seven people have died.\n\n\u200bAFP Fact Check is focused on combating misinformation about COVID-19. A roundup of our work in this area can be found here.", "lang": "en"}
