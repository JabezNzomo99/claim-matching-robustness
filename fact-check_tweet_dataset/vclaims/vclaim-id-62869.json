K.Srinivas,Vice President, Bharat biotech, taking Corona vaccine... Clinical trial immediately after taking the first dose he said that he is the first person in India to take vaccine developed by him and his team in Bharat Biotech Look at the confidence that they have in their product.\u201d\n\nThe message is also circulating on WhatsApp.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. Bharat Biotech has denied that the image is of clinical trials of its Covid-19 vaccine. The viral picture is of \u201croutine procedural blood draw for testing all production staff\u201d, it said.\n\nThe archived versions of the posts can be seen here and here. The image with the same claim has been shared by many on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nSoon after the image went viral, Bharat Biotech tweeted, refuting the claim. Part of its rebuttal says, \u201cCertain images and messages being circulated on WhatsApp and other social media platforms have been disseminated by Bharat Biotech. The image being circulated is a routine procedural blood draw for testing all production staff.\u201d\n\nOn July 1, news channel \u201cNDTV\u201d had tweeted an interview of Dr Krishna Ella, chairman and MD of Bharat Biotech, where he said that human trials should start in 10 days.\n\nHence, it can be concluded that the viral claim of Bharat Biotech V-P Dr VK Srinivas taking the first dose of anti-Covid vaccine \u201cCovaxin\u201d as human trial is misleading. The picture is of routine procedural blood draw for testing all production staff.", "lang": "en"}
