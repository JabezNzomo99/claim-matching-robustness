The slogan below it reads: \"First in news.\" But the supposed news story that social media users are now sharing from the site is fake.\n\n\"Los Angeles police: 12 white female bodies in garage freezer tagged, \u2018Black Lives Matter,\u2019\" it says. Though the story is undated, it claimed the Los Angeles Police Department made the \"gruesome discovery today.\"\n\n\"Upon arriving at the scene, police knocked on the door to be greeted by a man \u2018under the influence of drugs,\u2019\" the story says, italicizing that detail. \"Upon further investigation, they found 12 White Female Bodies in Garage Freezer Tagged, Black Lives Matter.\"\n\nThe victims were all white women in their mid-20s with blond hair, according to the story, and a suspect is identified only as \"Mathis.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Only in that version of the story, a 39-year-old man in Chicago was arrested after police found \"19 white female bodies in freezers with \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 carved into skin.\"\n\nBut we called LAPD to be sure. \"Fake news,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nWe rate this story Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
