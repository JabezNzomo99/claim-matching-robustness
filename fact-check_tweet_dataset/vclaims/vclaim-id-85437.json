The president then swiftly decided to follow the recommendation, notifying the FBI via email around 5 p.m. and in a letter delivered to the FBI by the president\u2019s longtime bodyguard. At the same time, the president personally called congressional leaders to let them know his decision. Comey learned the news from media reports. \u201cIt was all him,\u201d Spicer said of Rosenstein, as a reporter repeated his answer back to him. \u201cThat\u2019s correct \u2014 I mean, I can\u2019t, I guess I shouldn\u2019t say that, thank you for the help on that one. No one from the White House. That was a DOJ decision.\u201d\n\nThe next day, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders revealed Trump actually asked for the recommendation of Rosenstein and Sessions. Trump had been losing confidence in Comey for months and had been considering firing him since Election Day, she said: \u201cBut he did have a conversation with the deputy attorney general on Monday where they had come to him to express their concerns. The president asked that they put those concerns and their recommendation in writing, which is the letter that you guys have received.\u201d\n\nLester Holt: \u201cMonday, you met with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Did you ask for a recommendation?\u201d\n\n Trump: \u201cWhat I did was, I was going to fire. My decision.\u201d\n\n Holt: \u201cYou\u2019d made the decision before they came into the room?\u201d\n\n Trump: \u201cI was going to fire Comey. There\u2019s no time to do it.\u201d\n\n Holt: \u201cIn your letter, you said, \u2018I accept their recommendation.\u2019 \u201d\n\n Trump: \u201cOh, I was going to fire, regardless of recommendation. He made a recommendation, he\u2019s highly respected \u2014 very good guy, very smart guy. And the Democrats like him, Republicans like him. He made a recommendation, but regardless of recommendation, I was going to fire Comey.\u201d\n\nLater on Thursday, NBC aired its full interview with Trump. In it, Trump offered yet another reason for firing Comey: The FBI\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election. (Sanders had hinted at this earlier in the day, saying the White House believed that by removing Comey, it took steps to make sure the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation would \u201ccome to its conclusion with integrity.\u201d)", "lang": "en"}
