No, that's not true: It is a hoax story made up by a known fake news website, but copied and republished by other websites as the truth. There was no such case. Igor Hamilton is not the name of a real death row inmate. No condemned prisoner was released because of the failure of a lethal injection to end his life.\n\nThe story originated in a Huzler.com article on July 12, 2019, and was more recently republished an article (archived here) on a copycat site published on November 9, 2019 under the title \"Prisoner Sentenced To Death Survives Lethal Injection 3 Times, Set Free\". It read:\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nThe original Huzlers.com article did not carry a satire label, although the headline was suspicious since it claimed Hamilton had been sentenced to death for killing cats. While animal cruelty can be a felony crime, no government imposes a death penalty for it. None of these stories qualify as satire under the Lead Stories satire policy because of the lack of a clear label.", "lang": "en"}
