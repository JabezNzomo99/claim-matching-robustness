Like fire, it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.\u201d\n\nThere is no record of Washington ever making this statement.\n\nThis quote has appeared in print for more than a century, with etymologist Barry Popik tracing its first known appearance to 1902, attributed to none other than the country\u2019s first president, who died in 1799.\n\nThe original version of the quote is longer, offering this warning about government: \u201cNever for a moment should it be left to irresponsible action.\u201d\n\nThe expression has been investigated by a number of researchers, none of whom could locate it anywhere in Washington\u2019s writings. His estate at Mount Vernon includes the quote in its list of \u201cspurious quotations.\u201d\n\nAccording to the website Quote Investigator, the depiction of government as \u201ca dangerous servant and a fearful master\u201d is reminiscent of a centuries-old saying about water and fire. \u201cWater is a very good seruaunt, but it is a cruell mayster,\u201d reads an excerpt from 1562.\n\nThe phrase \u201cgovernment is force\u201d dates back to at least 1890, according to Popik. \u201cThe purification of politics is an iridescent dream,\u201d Kansas Senator John James Ingalls was quoted as saying. \u201cGovernment is force. Politics is a battle for supremacy.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
