No, that's not true, the story was made up by a site that posts satirical fake stories designed to get less intelligent people of right-wing persuasion to share them online so they can be mocked for it by fans of the site. It is not true and did not happen.\n\nThe story came from an article published by America's Last Line of Defense on June 11, 2018 titled \"BREAKING: President Trump Fires Muslim Judge (DETAILS)\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nJudge Salam al Alsawatha Malallahafa was appointed to the 14th district circuit court in 2009 by Barack Obama. Since that time, he has allowed 14 Muslim domestic abusers to go free based on \"their adherence to their own laws.\" He, of course, means Sharia Law, which allows for a woman or child to be beaten with sticks up to one inch thick for \"disobeying the man of the house.\" As if that weren't bad enough, Mallalahaffa also allowed a convicted child molester to go free, because the \"victim was his immediate family, which is allowable in his culture.\" Basically, this guy has been letting Sharia run free in 7 states for a decade. President Trump finally decided to take action tonight after getting word that a rapist was being sentenced to probation because \"to a Muslim, rape isn't really a crime.\" He used an age-old clause from the 15th amendment to take the judge down and make sure he never sits on a bench again.\n\nThere is no judge named \"Salam al Alsawatha Malallahafa\", the \"14th district court\" does not exist and the 15th Amendment reads:\n\nSection 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. Section 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\n\nIt is unclear how any of this could be used to deny a judge the ability to sit on a bench ever again. Also, the \"decided to take action\" link pointed to a cartoon of a sleeping President Trump.\n\nNone of this is surprising since the site comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including potatriotpost.us, dailyworldupdate.us and nofakenewsonline.us. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nWe wrote about americaslastlineofdefense.org before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Roseanne NOT To Host New Show On Fox News", "lang": "en"}
