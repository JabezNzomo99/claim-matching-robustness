Of course not, the cringeworthy story was entirely made up and it is not true.\n\nThe story recently went viral again via an article published by 8shit.net on March 24, 2018 titled \"Teenager Accidentally Chops Off His Genitals During Sex With A Blender\" (archived here) which opened:\n\n16-year old Brian Johnson was apparently alone in his parents' house and decided to engage in sexual intercourse with various objects around the residence. He admitted to having sex with a toaster, a vacuum cleaner, and an old video recorder, as well as a dozen other items. This strange sexual orgy could have continued for hours, but it was suddenly interrupted by a terrible accident. The young man had his genitals inside the electric blender and he accidentally hit one of the appliance's button, activating it. He was instantly emasculated by the rotating blade and his genitals were reduced to shreds in a matter of seconds.\n\nBut the story was actually copied in full from a May 14, 2017 article on World News Daily Report, a satire website:\n\nWe wrote about 8shit.net before, they specialize in fictional stories about bizarre behaviour, weird accidents and strange crimes:\n\u2022 Fake News: Man Did NOT Kill His Best Friend After Their Balls \"Touched\" During Threesome\n\u2022 Fake News: NO McDonald's Employee Fired For Putting His Mixtapes In Happy Meals\n\u2022 Fake News: Man Did NOT Kill Himself After Being Unexpectedly Disconnected From The Fortnite Server When He Was About To Win\n\u2022 Fake News: Man Did NOT Stab His Friend 63 Times For Making Them Lose A Fortnite Match\n\u2022 Fake News: Man Did NOT Climb Tree Dressed As A Bird, Did NOT Start Sh*tting On Random People\n\nFurthermore, 8shit.net carries a disclaimer on its about page that reads:\n\nAnd an additional disclaimer in the footer of every page:\n\n8Shit is a satire news and humor website.
