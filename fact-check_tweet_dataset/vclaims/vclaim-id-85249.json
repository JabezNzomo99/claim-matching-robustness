Trump takes credit for fulfilling his campaign promise of cracking down on illegal immigration, but these arrests are routine. We awarded Three Pinocchios to a similar claim this week.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement has always targeted dangerous criminals in enforcement priorities. The recent arrests, however, did include people who would not have fallen under narrowed enforcement priorities under former president Barack Obama. Still, 25 percent of the arrests were of people who had lesser charges and noncriminal convictions and are not the gang members or drug dealers that he describes.\n\nThis is not true. In an interview with Erin Burnett, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) made a joke about Trump labeling CNN as \u201cfake news.\u201d After he made the joke, the audio cut off, and CNN cut to a commercial.\n\nUpon returning from the commercial, Burnett picked up where they left: \u201cSenator, you were just talking \u2014 joking \u2014 about CNN, fake news.\u201d Then Sanders went on to criticize Trump\u2019s labeling of CNN as \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nThis is Trump\u2019s opinion, but we\u2019ll note that we fact-checked two separate claims by the White House senior policy adviser following his Sunday show interviews.\n\nMiller earned Four Pinocchios for repeating false voter-fraud claims. He earned another Three Pinocchios for claiming that 72 individuals from the banned countries in Trump\u2019s immigration executive order were implicated in \u201cterroristic activity.\u201d\n\nBefore becoming president, Trump heartily endorsed WikiLeaks and the release of classified information, particularly about his then-rival Hillary Clinton. During a July 2016 news conference, Trump even called on Russia to hack Clinton\u2019s email account: \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.\u201d\n\nNow, facing information leaks out of his own administration (including information that led to the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn), Trump decided it\u2019s a bad thing. (Read Fact Checker\u2019s complete timeline of Flynn\u2019s resignation.)\n\nActually, The Washington Post is doing great. The New York Times, like The Post, has seen spikes in audience and subscribers.\n\nBy the way, traffic to The Fact Checker is at an all-time high. We shattered our own traffic record in January 2017, when our monthly unique visitor count was 50 percent higher than the previous monthly record, set in October 2016.\n\nThis is another flip-flop for Trump, as we noted in an earlier fact-check. Before he was elected, he dismissed the stock-market performance under President Barack Obama as \u201cartificial\u201d and \u201ca bubble.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
