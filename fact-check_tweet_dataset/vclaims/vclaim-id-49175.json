No, that's not true: Sanders has been nothing but critical of Trump, publicly calling him a jackass on the campaign trail. In any case, this claim is a work of satire put out by a liberal from Maine who trolls conservative supporters of Trump.\n\nThe claim originated in an article published by ALLOD on March 22, 2020, titled \"Bernie Sanders Quits Democratic Primary, Endorses Trump\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nIn an absolutely stunning development today, Senator Bernie Sanders announced he is immediately suspending his campaign for the Democratic nomination and will endorse President Donald J. Trump in the 2020 election. While details are still coming in, this could be a game-changer for President Trump. Bernie Sanders has millions of loyal followers that could help push Trump over the edge. And widen his already huge lead in the polls over Joe Biden. Sanders currently is polling at around 45% of the Democratic electorate, so if even if a fraction of his supporters follow his move, Trump will be unbeatable in November.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this:\n\nSanders, who at one point was the Democrats' frontrunner, has suspended his campaign after several losses to former Vice President Joe Biden in key primary states.\n\nHowever, it would be stranger than fiction for the socialist-leaning senator from Vermont to give his approval to Republican Trump. It's all a hoax put out by a network of satirical wesbites.\n\nThe site ALLOD comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full-time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including bustatroll.org and bebest.website. Sometimes, he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll.\" A second man working on the sites is John Prager, as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites that often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past, but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nBlair and his operation were profiled by the Washington Post on November 17, 2018 by Eli Saslow:\n\n'Nothing on this page is real': How lies become truth in online America November 17 The only light in the house came from the glow of three computer monitors, and Christopher Blair, 46, sat down at a keyboard and started to type. His wife had left for work, and his children were on their way to school, but waiting online was his other community, an unreality where nothing was exactly as it seemed.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer, it is, of course, also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalists to rank the reliability of websites, describes wearethellod.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard, the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
