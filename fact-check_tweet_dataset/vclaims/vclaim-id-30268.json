Let\u2019s analyze the claim.\n\n\n\nClaim: Video of BJP MPs meeting Rajnath Singh and asking him to revoke Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC). Fact: The video is on the internet at least since August 2018. So, it is in no way connected to the recent CAA and NRC issues. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWhen the video in the post was uploaded on the \u2018InVid\u2019 plugin, many keyframes of it were obtained. When these keyframes are subjected to reverse image search technique, a certain keyframe was found in a Facebook post. The post was found to be published first on September 1, 2018, and had the text- \u2018Rajender Singh MLA BJP begging in front of Rajnath singh for upper caste against SC St act amendment and giving resign from MLA ship\u2019.\n\nAnother tweet with the date August 7, 2018, mentioning the video to be related to SC/ST Act was also found and it can be seen here. Though \u2018FACTLY\u2019 couldn\u2019t independently verify the claims about the video, it was found to exist on the internet at least since August-2018. So, it can be ascertained that the video has nothing to do with the recent CAA and NRC issues.\n\nTo conclude, an old video is being falsely shared as \u201888 BJP MPs met Rajnath Singh and asked him to revoke CAA and NRC\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our video on the 10 Most Ridiculous Fake News of the Year 2019?", "lang": "en"}
