Moreover, there was a general decline in the black vote in 2016, compared with 2012 or 2008, in both states that had voter ID laws and states that didn\u2019t.\n\nThe researcher of the study stood by its findings: \u201cOne state passed a voter ID law and another didn\u2019t. And in the state which did have a voter ID law, we saw larger declines in nonwhite turnout. And what I can say is internally, the other states which have done in voter ID laws also saw declines in nonwhite turnout.\u201d The internal data is not available publicly.\n\nBaldwin\u2019s staff says the findings in the Priorities USA report are consistent with the findings of a 2014 Government Accountability Office report that analyzed various data sets to find out the impact of voter ID laws in Kansas and Tennessee in 2012. The report found that a decline of 1.9 to 2.2 percentage points in Kansas and a decline of 2.2 to 3.2 percentage points in Tennessee that were attributable to changes in voter requirements.\n\nScott Spector, spokesman for Baldwin\u2019s campaign, said: \u201cFrom the 90-year-old woman in Eau Claire that can\u2019t obtain a Wisconsin photo ID due to a typo on her birth certificate to a woman in Milwaukee who lost her driver\u2019s license right before Election Day and wasn\u2019t able to cast a ballot, examples of law-abiding Wisconsinites no longer allowed to participate in their civic duty due to the new restrictive photo ID requirements for voting abound. No matter the number, any eligible Wisconsin voters unable to participate in our democratic process due to the new law is too many.\u201d\n\n[Update: A September 2017 study by University of Wisconsin-Madison researcher Kenneth Mayer found 11.2 percent of eligible nonvoting registrants \u2014 or 16,801 people \u2014 were deterred from voting in the 2016 election due to the state\u2019s voter-identification law. About six percent of nonvoters \u2014 could be up to 9.4 percent, or 14,101 people, based on the confidence level \u2014 were prevented from voting because they lacked identification, or cited the identification requirement as the main reason they didn\u2019t vote, the study found. Hasen wrote this was a careful study that \u201cseems much sounder\" than the earlier Priorities study.]\n\nThe study that Baldwin cited looks at turnout in Wisconsin compared with Minnesota, which does not have a voter ID law. It finds that Wisconsin had lower turnout among nonwhite communities while Minnesota did not \u2014 then concludes votes were suppressed, without exploring any other factors that may have affected turnout. By the time of Baldwin\u2019s tweet, there were several criticisms of this report and talking point. It should have been a warning sign to her campaign staff before she tweeted it as a definitive fact with no caveats.\n\nThe 2014 GAO report found that in 2012, compared with 2008, there was a decline in participation in Kansas in certain registered voting groups \u2014 voters 18 to 23 years old, those registered less than one year, and black voters. The GAO controlled for other factors that may have affected such turnout, especially compared with turnout in states similar to Kansas, and found changes in voter ID requirements may have led to the decline.", "lang": "en"}
