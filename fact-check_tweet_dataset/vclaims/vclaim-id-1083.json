This allegation is false: the picture actually shows a woman who was sexually assaulted in Spain.\n\nThe posts ( here , here , here , here , here , and here ) claim to show the victim of an attack by Floyd and a group of other men. They appear to be referring to a 2007 armed robbery of which Floyd was later convicted.\n\nFloyd was accused of being part of a home robbery by six men and holding a gun to a woman\u2019s stomach. He was convicted of aggravated robbery, according to news reports and crime records available from the Texas Department of Public Safety ( here and here and here ). The crime records can be accessed after creating an account and paying a fee. There is no evidence to support the claim that the woman was kidnapped.\n\nThe woman falsely identified in the posts as Floyd\u2019s victim is Andrea Sicignano, who was raped in Madrid in 2018. She said on Facebook ( here ) that she posted a picture of her battered face more than a year ago \u201cto spread awareness and encourage other women to speak out about the injustices they've faced\u201d.\n\nHer case was reported at the time here .\n\nSicignano said she was disgusted that \u201ctoday my photo is being used as political propaganda/click bait to make people believe that George Floyd deserved to die\u201d.\n\nFalse. The woman shown in the social media posts was the victim of sexual assault in Spain that has nothing to do with any case involving George Floyd.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
