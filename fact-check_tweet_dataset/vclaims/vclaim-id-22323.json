People also argued about New Delhi turning down Abu Dhabi's proposed aid.\n\nBut now the UAE has stated it never offered Rs 700 crore for the Kerala relief in the first place. So, now people are wondering from where the figure of Rs 700 crore came from.\n\nOn Aug 21, the office of the Kerala CM announced in a press statement that \"Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan informed that the United Arab Emirates will provide Kerala an assistance of Rs 700 Crore. Kerala has a special relationship with (the) UAE, which is a home away from home for Malayalees. We express our gratitude to (the) UAE for their support.\"\n\nThe statement expressing gratitude towards the UAE prince was also shared by the CM on this Facebook page the same day.\n\nThe chief minister's office tweeted about it as well. In the tweet, the information about Rs 700-crore aid was attributed to the chairman of the Lulu Group, Yusuff Ali.\n\nHe is an influential Malayali business tycoon based in Abu Dhabi, whose empire is spread across the Gulf.\n\nThe news went viral on social media within no time.\n\nAnd thus began a slander campaign against the Centre for \"handing out a raw deal to Kerala by announcing only Rs 600 crore package as against a demand of Rs 2,000 crore by the state government\".\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi thanked the UAE for the \"support\" even before the news of Rs 700-crore financial aid was tweeted by the Kerala CM.\n\nBut the PM's tweet on Aug 18 did not mention any details of what was offered by Abu Dhabi.\n\nAmidst the raging controversy over the Rs 700-crore figure and India declining it, the UAE Ambassador to India, Ahmed Albanna, told India Today on Friday: \"The UAE says no specific amount was offered. An emergency committee has been formed to assess the situation and offer assistance to Kerala.\"\n\nThis revelation kicked off a fresh bout of slander campaign on social media, this time against the Kerala CM.\n\nSo from where did Pinarayi Vijayan quote Rs 700 crore as aid coming in from the UAE?\n\nHis Twitter timeline reveals that he had quoted the chairman of the Lulu Group, Yusuff Ali, as the source of information on Aug 21 itself.\n\nBut neither the Lulu Group has issued any such statement nor is there any such tweet by them in this regard.\n\nIndia Today tried reaching out to the company for a response. But its communications officer didn't respond to our phone calls.\n\nAn email sent to Ali for a comment on the claim made by Kerala CM is still awaiting response.\n\nThat whether the Lulu Group chairman really told the Kerala CM about any UAE plans to give Rs 700 crore for flood relief during their conversation will only be known only after one of them speaks about it publicly.\n\nTill then, there is no other evidence in public domain to prove that Abu Dhabi made any such offer.", "lang": "en"}
