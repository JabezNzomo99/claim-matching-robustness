Most of the story consists of quotes from angry attendees at the school board meeting the day before, during which the curriculum was approved unanimously. The new curriculum is expected to go into effect in May 2020.\n\nAlthough Austin Independent School District (Austin ISD) board did vote to update the sex-ed curriculum for third- to eighth-graders for the first time in 10 years, the Starnes article appeared designed to elicit maximum fear and outrage from readers. While liberally quoting from opponents of the curriculum update, it briefly describes supporters like this: \u201cThose speaking on behalf of the plan included a nine-year-old child, a fourth-grader, the parent of a transgender second-grader, a lady who identified by the pronoun \u2018they/them\u2019 and some gal wearing a t-shirt that read, \u2018I met God. They\u2019re queer, y\u2019all.'\u201d\n\n\u201cIn spite of overwhelming opposition from parents and pastors, the district\u2019s trustees voted early Tuesday morning to implement a pornographic sex education policy that includes instruction on anal sex and how to place a condom on an erect penis,\u201d Starnes reported.\n\nThe article was short on facts. No, parents will not be \u201cmandated\u201d to send their children to \u201cpornographic\u201d instructional sessions. For starters, none of the sex-ed lessons at Austin schools are \u201cmandated,\u201d and parents can opt their children out of \u201cone, several, or all lessons,\u201d according to Michele Rusnak, health and physical education supervisor for Austin ISD.\n\n\u201cOpt out letters are provided to parents at the Parent Orientation meeting that happens in March or April, which is provided by the principal,\u201d Rusnak said in an email to Snopes. \u201cThe campus also sends out the letter at least 3 weeks prior to instruction, which happens in May. Students opting out are provided SEL [social and emotional learning] type lessons in a different location.\u201d\n\nRusnak added that the new curriculum does not teach students \u201chow to have anal sex,\u201d but instead \u201crefers to how anal sex is a way to transmit [sexually transmitted infections].\u201d Overviews of both the elementary-level and middle school-level curricula can be found on Austin ISD\u2019s website.\n\nThe curricula are categorized into the categories of \u201chealthy relationships\u201d; \u201cpersonal safety\u201d; \u201cidentity\u201d; \u201canatomy and physiology\u201d; and \u201cpuberty and adolescent development.\u201d When children reach the fifth grade, two additional categories are added: \u201cpregnancy and reproduction,\u201d and \u201csexually transmitted diseases and HIV.\u201d\n\nThe curricula state that the older students will learn, among many other topics, differing expressions of gender and how to communicate respectfully about that, along with \u201cmedically accurate\u201d information and terminology about topics like puberty, reproduction, intercourse, and sexually transmitted diseases and prevention. The courses also teach children how to maintain personal boundaries and how the media can impact body image.\n\nBecause the Starnes article falsely states that the sex-ed classes offered at Austin ISD are \u201cmandatory\u201d when parents can in fact opt their children out, and because it grossly misrepresents the course material, we are labeling this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
