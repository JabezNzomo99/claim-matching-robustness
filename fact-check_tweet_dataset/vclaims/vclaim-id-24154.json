We followed up with this logo which said \u201cBritant\u201d and \u201cNews\u201d.\n\nTaking these as the key words, The Quint conducted a google search and came across the website of News Britant, a local news channel. The channel has the same logo as the one shown in the viral video.\n\nAfter this, we used the key words \u201cBloody\u201d and \u201cPolice\u201d in Bengali and searched on the website. The search led us to the original news report that was published by News Britant on 12 April 2019.\n\nAccording to the News Britant report, the incident involved an accident on National Highway 31, which resulted in the death of two locals in Jalpaiguri's Raiganj Chowki area. The police were allegedly busy with providing security cover for politician Abhishek Banerjee's rally nearby and were unable to reach the spot on time. When they did reach along with four civic volunteers, the frenzied mob reportedly attacked the volunteers in a fit of rage, also attacking the police vehicle in the process. This left the civic volunteers seriously injured. An additional police force had to be sent to the area to control the mob, officials told News Britant.", "lang": "en"}
