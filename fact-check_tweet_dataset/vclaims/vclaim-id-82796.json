But he obscures his voting record on abortion.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2016-02-02T18:55:35Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-82796", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/07/08/michigan-lawmaker-inflates-his-conservative-cred/", "vclaim": "Our colleagues at FactCheck.org have already rapped Ellis\u2019s knuckles for giving an incomplete account of Amash\u2019s vote against the Prenatal Non-Discrimination Act, which would have made it a crime for a doctor to perform an abortion based on the gender of the fetus. The ad even cites that fact check to claim that Ellis is \u201clying\u201d about Amash.\n\nAmash is certainly backed by Club for Growth and FreedomWorks. But his relationship with the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) is more complicated.\n\nWill Adams, an Amash spokesman, pointed to the NRLC\u2019s legislative scorecard for the still-uncompleted 113th Congress, showing that Amash (along with every other Michigan Republican) had a 100 percent rating, based on four key votes.\n\nBut that ignores the fact that in 112th Congress, Amash had a 70 percent rating\u2014and every other Michigan Republican still had a 100 percent rating. Amash earned his rating because he voted against one of ten votes scored by the NRLC (concerning gender-selective abortion)\u2014and present on two other bills to defund Planned Parenthood. As our colleagues at PolitiFact noted, only six Republicans in the entire House caucus rated lower than Amash in the 2011-2012 period.\n\nAmash explained his votes on his Facebook page, saying for instance that the Planned Parenthood bill \u201cviolates my conservative approach to legislating.\u201d But his explanations did not convince the NRLC.\n\nDouglas Johnson, NRLC legislative director, blasted Amash\u2019s votes in an interview with The Christian Post in 2012. \u201cAmash\u2019s pro-life voting record is the seventh worst of all House Republicans. With such a record, he is unlikely to rally pro-life support to his new flag \u2013 a flag that seems designed mostly to cover his backside back home,\u201d he said.\n\nTatiana Bergum, NRLC\u2019s deputy press secretary, referred The Fact Checker to Amash\u2019s scorecards for both the 112th Congress and 113th Congress, to date. \u201cNational Right to Life has not rated anyone, including Rep. Amash, as a \u2018#1 conservative,\u2019 nor does National Right to Life rate members of Congress in terms of \u2018conservative\u2019 or \u2018liberal,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cNational Right to Life has made no endorsement in the primary election.\u201d\n\nHowever, Ellis has been endorsed by the state affiliate, Right to Life Michigan, which had decried Amash\u2019s votes of \u201cpresent\u201d on the Planned Parenthood bills.\n\n\u201cNRLC claims not to be a \u2018conservative\u2019 or \u2018liberal\u2019 organization,\u201d Adams said. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s indisputable that being pro-life in American politics at this time is strongly associated with being \u2018conservative\u2019 \u2014 and there\u2019s plenty of polling data to back that up. The question is: Has Justin been given the top rating among Michigan congressmen by many conservative organizations? The answer is \u2018yes,\u2019 and his 100% rating from NRLC is evidence for this because, by definition, 100% is the rating you get when you are \u2018#1\u2019\u2013no one has a higher rating.\u201d\n\nClearly Amash feels under some pressure for some of his abortion-related votes. Lumping the NLRC with two organizations that have clearly endorsed him certainly leaves a misleading impression\u2014especially when the state affiliate has endorsed his rival.\n\nAmash is cherry-picking the congressional session to put himself in the best possible light. But when the two score cards are combined, Amash\u2019s NRLC rating would be lower than any of his GOP House colleagues from Michigan. That\u2019s certainly not \u201cnumber one,\u201d at least in the case of the NRLC.", "lang": "en"}
