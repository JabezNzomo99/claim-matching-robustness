It is being claimed that the picture shows a Palestine police office kneeling on an Israeli man.\n\nThe caption of the picture reads, \u2018An Israeli soldier on the top and an innocent Palestinian child\u2019s neck under his kneecap. The Israeli soldier suffocated the child to death while he begging to breathe just like George Floyd\ufffc\ufffc did. Unfortunately this is a normal practice by Israeli soldiers in Palestine\u2019.\n\nSince the incident is being compared to police brutality against Geroge Floyd, it is being suggested on the social media that the incident is recent.\n\nClick here for the achieved post. (Sensitive content)\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked and found that the post is fake.\n\nWhen we put the picture through Reverse Image Search, we found a report by a Chilean news website 24 Horas, dated October 3, 2016, featuring a video of the incident.\n\nAccording to the report, the cop caught the boy doing graffiti on the streets of Valpara\u00edso, Chile and detained him.\n\nThe incident was reported by another Chilean news website, Epicenter Chile on October 1, 2016. Nowhere in the reports, it is mentioned that the man in the picture died.\n\nIn the video embedded in the report, we spotted an insignia on the officer\u2019s uniform. On comparing the insignia in the video with the logo of \u2018Carabineros de Chile\u2019- Chile\u2019s national police force, it became clear that the officer in the picture in from Chile.\n\nThis proves that the picture in question is old not from Palestine and hence the claim is fake.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
