He counts tax changes that cut taxes and ignores those that will increase taxes.\n\nFor example, doubling the standard deduction results in $720 billion less in tax revenues over 10 years, but repealing personal exemptions increases tax revenues by more than $1.2 trillion.\n\nTrump\u2019s one-sided description of the tax benefits of the bill came in remarks at the White House as Republican lawmakers celebrated passage of the tax bill, which he signed Dec. 22.\n\nThat statistic was echoed in a White House fact sheet on the tax bill released the same day.\n\nIt was also parroted in a tweet from Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter.\n\nIt\u2019s true that changes in the new law that would cut taxes \u2014 for individual, business and international taxes \u2014 comes to about $5.5 trillion, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. But when all of the provisions are considered \u2014 including those that would raise tax revenue \u2014 the government\u2019s nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the tax law will result in $1.456 trillion less paid in individual, business and international taxes to the U.S. government over the next 10 years.\n\nThat\u2019s why major media outlets typically refer to it as a \u201c$1.5 trillion tax bill.\u201d\n\nThe president cited a subset of that $5.5 trillion, the amount that he said would go to \u201cAmerican families.\u201d\n\nTo get to the $3.2 trillion figure, the White House tallied the provisions in the tax plan that would reduce tax revenues paid by families to the government, but similarly ignored provisions that would increase them. That includes:\n\u2022 $1.2 trillion in cuts through changes to the tax brackets. The new law reduces five of the seven tax rates, including cutting the top rate from 39.6 to 37 percent.\n\u2022 $720 billion by roughly doubling of the standard deduction (to $12,000 for singles and $24,000 for married people filing jointly).\n\u2022 $637 billion in relief from the alternative minimum tax, which is paid by high-income taxpayers instead of using the regular tax system to calculate tax liability.\n\u2022 Another roughly $100 billion from things like expansion of medical expense deductions, and reduced estate tax revenues.\n\nWhat it does not include are the many offsets in the tax plan. The biggest is the elimination of personal exemptions \u2014 which is a deduction taxpayers receive for each person claimed on tax returns.\n\nUnder the old tax code, filers received a personal exemption of $4,050 per person, which means a married couple with two dependents receives a personal exemption of $16,200. That goes away under the new law (though as written, it would return after 2025). That provision will increase revenue to the government by a little more than $1.2 trillion over 10 years.\n\nBut there are other measures that work against taxpayers, including new limits on itemized deductions such as for state and local income taxes and some mortgage deductions.\n\nAccording to the Joint Committee on Taxation, changes to the tax code would, on net, result in a little more than $1.1 trillion less being paid in individual taxes over the next 10 years. We can\u2019t say exactly how much of that goes to families, since some business owners \u2014 such as partners in limited liability corporations \u2014 pay taxes through personal income taxes.\n\nMore importantly, it is misleading to refer to the cuts without including the increases. It would be similarly misleading \u2014 and absurd \u2014 for opponents of the tax plan to refer only to the tax increases.\n\n\u201cTaxpayers care about the bottom line of how much they owe, not how much the beneficial provisions alone help them, ignoring those provisions that raise their taxes,\u201d Eric Toder, co-director of the Tax Policy Center, told us via email.\n\nOverall, the tax plan will reduce taxes for most people in the first eight years. The Tax Policy Center analyzed the tax bill and concluded that most taxpayers at all income levels would get a tax cut in the years 2018 through 2025. As written, some of the individual tax benefits would expire and as a result, by 2027 more than half of taxpayers would pay higher taxes.\n\nIt is fair to say that the tax plan would cut taxes. But reporting only one half of the ledger \u2014 just the benefits and not the offsets \u2014 is misleading, and inflates the overall impact of the tax changes. The Joint Committee on Taxation says it would cut taxes by nearly $1.5 trillion over 10 years. That\u2019s the unspun figure.", "lang": "en"}
