As of Lucas\u2019 May 4 updated order, this is no longer compulsory. Liberty Council's article mentioned in this fact check was true at the time of its publication (May 1), and they have since published an update reflecting the new order visible here .\n\nA widely shared claim online alleges that Kansas City, Missouri, is requiring churches to maintain an attendee register and submit it to the government.\n\nExamples of the claim can be seen here , here and here .\n\nOne post states: \u201cKansas City, Missouri, officials are now requiring every church to submit a list of members and attendees,\u201d and \u201cChurchgoers Must Register With the Government in Kansas City\u201d.\n\nThe claim, which likely stems from an article published on the religious organization Liberty Council\u2019s website on May 1, 2020, visible here , is inaccurate. Some iterations of the post include a screenshot from the Liberty Council article.\n\nThe Office of Mayor Quinton Lucas confirmed to Reuters that Kansas City is recommending, not requiring, public-facing establishments and in-person religious gatherings to maintain a record of attendees on the premises for a minimum of 30 days.\n\nMayor Lucas\u2019 Stay-at-Home Order update signed on May 4, establishes that: \u201cin the interest of public health and to avoid a Covid-19 outbreak in the community, event organizers should consider maintaining a record of attendees where appropriate. Attendees are not required, however, to provide their names or contact information at any religious gathering.\u201d (Points H and F visible here )\n\nThe recommendation is not exclusive to religious gatherings. It applies to all non-essential retail stores and personal care services in which non-employees typically spend more than 10 minutes inside, like restaurants and salons. (See Section Two, Letter F, page 3 here )\n\nThis recommendation is to \u201chelp with contact tracing in the case that a COVID-positive individual visited said establishment while they were ill\u201d, a spokesperson from the Office of Mayor Quinton Lucas told Reuters.\n\nIt is misleading to say these records will serve tracking and surveillance purposes. In a statement shared with the media, Mayor Lucas stressed the government \u201cwill not create or keep any records\u201d from this information and that \u201cthe Health Department is bound to confidentiality as it works with any organization to protect its attendees.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) describes contact tracing as a \u201ckey strategy for preventing further spread of COVID-19\u201d and as a \u201ccore disease control measure\u201d that has been employed by health department personnel for decades ( here ). As countries investigate how to lift stay-at-home orders, extensive contact tracing will be needed to prevent new outbreaks. Read more about how it works here .\n\nPartly False. Churches and other public establishments are recommended, not required, to keep a record of attendees to help health authorities with contact tracing amidst the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
