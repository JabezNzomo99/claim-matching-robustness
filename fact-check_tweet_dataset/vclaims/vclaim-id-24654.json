This story also is updated with additional information and reaction from the Gunvor Group, as well as a note that we sought additional information from Aslund].\n\nIn an op-ed published on May 10 titled \u201cPutin\u2019s Invisible Billions are Once Again Calculated in the U.S.A.,\u201d RIA Novosti columnist Ivan Danilov lashed out at the efforts of Western analysts to determine the scope of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s alleged fortune.\n\nDanilov targeted an assessment quoted by Newsweek magazine this past February, made by Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist and resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington, D.C., who served as an adviser to the governments of Russia and Ukraine in the 1990s.\n\n\"You can see the Russian state transactions and the money leaving the country. Capital flight is around $800 billion, and one-sixth probably belongs to Putin and one-sixth for his friends,\" Aslund told Newsweek. \"I would estimate that Putin is worth around $100-160 billion. We can see that Putin and his friends have taken $10-15 billion from Gazprom every year since 2004. That\u2019s just Gazprom. There are large numbers of transactions being made.\"\n\nAslund added: \"What\u2019s much more difficult is to see where the money goes. It\u2019s typically Cyprus, Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands and Wilmington, Delaware. The U.S. needs legislation against anonymous companies. The ultimate beneficiaries should be published.\u201d\n\nIn his commentary, Danilov compared the quality of Aslund\u2019s assessment to that of an \u201canonymous troll,\u201d claiming that rather than dealing in real analysis, the Swedish economist is \u201cengaged in propaganda based on personal projection.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems as if the \u2018Atlantic Council\u2019 expert built his logical structure on the basis of what he would have done had he come to power: rob the country, take the loot offshore, leave half for himself and feel like the bee\u2019s knees, even if one cannot use the received money,\u201d Danilov wrote.\n\nHe added that despite having access to all the financial transactions in the West and their respective territories, neither American intelligence agencies nor their peers were able to find Putin\u2019s \u201cmythical\u201d wealth.\n\nReached for comment, Aslund said Danilov\u2019s editorial \u201cdoes not contain arguments but sheer slander.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have published a book with all the evidence, which he ignores,\u201d Aslund told Polygraph.info.\n\nIn that book, \u201cRussia\u2019s Crony Capitalism: The Path from Market Economy to Kleptocracy,\u201d Aslund explains in more detail how he arrived at his estimate of Putin\u2019s wealth:\n\n\u201cMy assessment is that since Putin\u2019s circle got its looting fully organized around 2006, they have extracted $15-25 billion a year, reaching a total of $195-325 billion, a large share of the Russian private offshore wealth. Presuming that half of this wealth belongs to Putin, his net wealth would amount to $100-160 billion. Naturally, Putin and his cronies cannot enjoy their wealth. It is all about power. If they are not the wealthiest, they fear they will lose power.\u201d\n\nPolygraph.info asked Aslund to provide more details concerning the money transferred abroad by Putin and his \u201cfriends,\u201d including specifics regarding the \u201clarge numbers of transactions\u201d he referred to in his Newsweek interview. At the time of publication, he had not responded.\n\nDespite Danilov\u2019s claims, Aslund says it is remarkable that RIA Novosti opted to publish his argument and figures at all.\n\n\u201cPresumably that means that they are so widely cited that RIA thinks that it has to deal with them. Normally official Russian media just ignore me. This is a very good sign,\u201d he said. \u201cMy conclusion is that we need to continue hammer on so that the official propagandists, such as Danilov, next find it necessary to go into real arguments. Thus, this might represent a small step forward.\u201d\n\nThe subject of Putin\u2019s wealth has long been a matter of speculation in both the West and Russia.\n\nThis past February, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham introduced the Defending American Security from Kremlin Aggression Act of 2019. Among other things, it calls on the Director of U.S. National Intelligence to submit \u201ca detailed report on the personal net worth and assets\u201d of Russian President Vladimir Putin. That U.S. intelligence report is pending.\n\nPutin\u2019s press secretary Dmitry Peskov characterized the U.S. congressional efforts to determine Putin\u2019s wealth as a manifestation of \u201cRussophobia.\u201d\n\nWhile Danilov claimed in his commentary that the U.S. and other Western intelligence agencies were unable to find what he characterized as Putin\u2019s \u201cmythical billions,\u201d the New York Times reported in 2014 that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency had in fact looked into Putin\u2019s wealth. According to the newspaper, the CIA conducted a secret (and unreleased) assessment in 2007 that estimated the Russian leader\u2019s wealth at $40 billion.\n\nThat mirrored a 2007 assessment by Russian political expert Stanislav Belkovsky, who likewise estimated Putin\u2019s wealth at $40 billion. Belkovsky claimed the Russian president \"effectively\" controlled 37% of the shares of Surgutneftegaz, an oil exploration company and Russia's third biggest oil producer, which at the time was worth $20 billion, as well as 4.5% of Russia\u2019s natural gas monopoly Gazprom and \"at least 75%\" of Gunvor, a Swiss-based oil trading company founded by billionaire Putin-confidant Gennady Timchenko.\n\nIn 2008, a U.S. diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks similarly alleged that Gunvor \u201cis rumored to be one of Putin's sources of undisclosed wealth,\u201d noting that opposition leader Alexei Navalny had \u201csued Gunvor and several Russian oil companies for information regarding their oil trading practices\u201d and estimating \u201cthat Gunvor may control up to 50% of total Russian oil exports.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Adam Szubin, who was then the U.S. Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Crimes, told the BBC the U.S. government had evidence linking Putin\u2019s wealth to Timchenko\u2019s activities.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, President Putin has never had any interest in, investment in, or involvement with Gunvor Group either directly or indirectly,\u201d Seth Thomas Pietras, the Corporate Affairs Director of Gunvor Group, said in an e-mail to Polygraph.info. \u201cMr. Belkovsky's claims are based on absolutely nothing and are fundamentally ridiculous. And the U.S. government, despite its statement has never sanctioned Gunvor in any capacity, nor has it provided any evidence of its own.\u201d\n\nIn March 2014, Reuters reported Timochenko, identified as a co-owner of Gunvor, faced U.S. sanctions. Concern that Gunvor could be caught in those sanctions \u201cdissipated\u201d by evening when it was reported that co-founder Torbjorn Tornqvist said Timochenko had sold his 44 percent stake in the firm.\n\nPietras said Gunvor does business in the U.S. to this day.\n\nAs previously reported by Polygraph.info, the opaque nature of the alleged schemes used to mask Putin\u2019s wealth has led to widely varying estimates over the years.\n\nIn 2012, Belkovsky revised his estimate of Putin\u2019s wealth to $60-70 billion.\n\nAlso in 2012, Leonid Martynyuk and the late opposition leader Boris Nemtsov released a report titled \u201cLife of a galley slave (palaces, yachts, cars, planes and other accessories),\u201d which claimed Putin had 20 palaces and villas, including \u201cPutin\u2019s Palace,\u201d a Black Sea property worth $1 billion dollars that was allegedly built through a convoluted cash flow scheme.\n\nThey also alleged that Putin owned some 43 aircraft, various yachts (including a $35 million vessel allegedly transferred to Putin via the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich) and an extensive watch collection.\n\nIn 2016, documents leaked from Mossack Fonseca & Co., a Panamanian law firm and corporate service provider, which became known as the Panama Papers, included personal financial information about public officials worldwide, including several close to Putin.\n\nThe Panama Papers revealed that Sergei Roldugin, a cellist, lifelong friend and godfather to Putin\u2019s eldest daughter, Maria, had helped moved billions of dollars through a series of shell companies.\n\nIn 2017, Kremlin critic and financier Bill Browder assessed Putin\u2019s wealth at $200 billion.\n\nIn the run-up to the Russian presidential election last year, Russia\u2019s Central Election Commission released information on Putin\u2019s personal assets and income, stating that he earned an average of $112,000 a year between 2011 and 2016, totaling approximately $673,000, the Washington Post reported\n\nPutin listed 13 bank accounts with a combined balance of $241,000, an 800-square-foot apartment in St. Petersburg, 230 shares in Bank Saint Petersburg and three automobiles.\n\nReports of such relatively modest holdings have been ridiculed by the Russian president\u2019s critics, with Boris Nemtsov noting in 2012 that Putin would not have been able to \u201ceat or drink for six years\u201d to have acquired his (then) $700,000 watch collection.\n\nAn expert on Russian politics and security, Mark Galeotti, has said that, given the way Putin\u2019s alleged holdings are managed, \u201cspecific assertions regarding Putin\u2019s alleged riches rest on rather shakier evidentiary grounds.\u201d\n\nBelkovsky, when he assessed Putin\u2019s wealth at $40 billion in 2007, said that the Russian president\u2019s name does not appear on any shareholders' register, given that there \u201cis a non-transparent scheme of successive ownership of offshore companies and funds.\u201d\n\nStill, he added: \u201cBut please pay attention that Vladimir Vladimirovich [Putin] has never sued me.\"\n\nThe late Karen Dawisha, in her book \u201cPutin\u2019s Kleptocracy,\u201d said that the proxy system through which Putin\u2019s alleged wealth is distributed means that he, like many of Russia\u2019s oligarchs, has access to wealth rather than ownership of it.\n\nCritics and investigative journalists have made a strong case that Putin\u2019s holdings far outweigh his declared assets.\n\nThere is uncertainty on the precise sum of Putin's wealth, and the assessment by the Director of U.S. National Intelligence apparently is not yet complete. However, with the pile of evidence and documents in the Panama Papers and in the hands of independent investigators such as those cited by Dawisha, Polygraph.info finds that Danilov\u2019s claim that Western intelligence agencies have not been able to find evidence of Putin\u2019s wealth to be misleading.", "lang": "en"}
