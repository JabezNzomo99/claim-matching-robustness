Adam Schiff and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein exchanged.\n\nThere is no evidence to corroborate the claim. It originated in an article published on a satire website.\n\nSocial media platforms are replete with dubious claims about prominent politicians. In this particular case, a screen grab of an article alleges that the FBI uncovered 256 emails exchanged between the House Intelligence Committee chairman and Epstein, who died in jail of an apparent suicide last year while awaiting trial for federal sex trafficking charges.\n\n\u201cFBI Investigation Uncovers 256 Emails Between Schiff and Epstein,\u201d reads the headline of the screen grabbed article. (RELATED: Did Nancy Pelosi\u2019s Church Ask Her Not To Come Until She \u2018Finds God And Gets Help\u2019?)\n\nThere is, however, no evidence to corroborate the post\u2019s claim. Had the FBI uncovered such emails between Schiff and Epstein, it would have been picked up by major news outlets, yet none have reported on it.\n\nAn internet search of the headline reveals the image \u2013 and its claim \u2013 appear to have originated on America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes \u201cparody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d The satire article, which puts up the same headline and features the same image of Schiff, appears under the \u201cSatire for Stupid People\u201d category.\n\nYet, while America\u2019s Last Line of Defense clearly disclaims the satirical nature of the article, the screen grab being shared on Facebook fails to do so, portraying it as real.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the Daily Caller has debunked a claim that originated on a satirical news website. In January, a viral image falsely claimed Schiff would be charged with \u201cpresidential harassment.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
