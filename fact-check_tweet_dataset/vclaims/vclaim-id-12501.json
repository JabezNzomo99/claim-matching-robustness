Greater Manchester Police told us the cameras were on and working from 1 January 2019.\n\nBut the speed limit part of this claim is not quite correct. The national speed limit on motorways for most vehicles is 70mph, and Greater Manchester Police told us \u201cthe cameras are set to deal with offenders exceeding the 70 mile per hour speed limit\u201d. Whether you get fined and how much by depends on the discretion of police or the decision of a court in some cases.\n\nConfusion around 72mph may come from police guidance, not law, on when to give people fixed penalty notices. We\u2019ve written more about that here.\n\nThese speed cameras were on before the Facebook post was shared\n\nGreater Manchester Police told us that before the cameras started working on 1 January, \u201cofficers were patrolling the motorway network to deal with speeding motorists during the commissioning of the new cameras\u201d.\n\nThere were also \u201caverage speed cameras set at 50 miles per hour at various locations across the motorway whilst the road workings and upgrade took place\u201d.\n\nConfusion may have arisen from the fact that parts of the M60 and M62 are smart motorways, where speed limits can be varied according to traffic flow.\n\nHighways England (the government company which operates and maintains motorways) told us \u201cthe cameras are capable of enforcing the national speed limit when a variable limit is not displayed.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve factchecked a similar claim about changes to speed limits, fines and bans on the M25 and M1.
