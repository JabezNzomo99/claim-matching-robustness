The message urges social media users to not buy anything from Pista House, a bakery chain based in Hyderabad. The same video posted by a Facebook user named Sanjay Jain DeenDayal has been shared more than 400 times.\n\nSeveral other individuals have shared the video on Facebook with a similar narrative.\n\nThe same video is circulating on Facebook with the following claim in Telugu, \u201c\u0c39\u0c48\u0c26\u0c30\u0c3e\u0c2c\u0c3e\u0c26\u0c4d \u0c32\u0c4b\u0c28\u0c3f KARACHI BAKERY \u0c32\u0c4b \u0c10\u0c1f\u0c2e\u0c4d\u0c38\u0c4d \u0c1a\u0c42\u0c21\u0c02\u0c21\u0c3f.. \u0c0e\u0c32\u0c3e \u0c2a\u0c3e\u0c1a\u0c3f\u0c2a\u0c4b\u0c2f\u0c3e\u0c2f\u0c4b (See items in Karachi Bakery, Hyderabad -translated)\u201d.\n\nThe video is also circulating on social media with a claim that it\u2019s from Moti Bakery, Ahmedabad.\n\nAlt News has received requests to fact-check the video on its official App where it is claimed that this video was shot at Naaz Bakery, Pune.\n\nOn a closer analysis of the video, we found that the label on the food packets reads, \u201cTreats Bakery\u201d. A Google search reveals that the store shown in the video is Treats Bakery, Karachi and NOT Pista House, Hyderabad.\n\nOn further searching for Treats Bakery, Karachi, Alt News found a clarification video in which Pakistani food authority personnel along with the owner and the customer can be seen.\n\nMohammed Tehseen, the man who claims to be the food safety officer said, \u201cWe had received a complaint through social media that a kid had vomited after eating stale food product. Within half an hour, we reached the spot with police and took action.\u201d\n\nThe customer who had complained about his child\u2019s upset stomach said, \u201cYesterday, a sudden incident took place where there was a misunderstanding. The kid had actually eaten a Pizza after which a piece of the food item had stuck in his throat due to which he started vomiting. We later came to know that it was ketchup and not blood.\u201d He further appreciated the Sindh Food Authorities [SFA] for the timely action and I have no complaints with the owner of the bakery as well.\n\nIn conclusion, a video of an enraged customer involved in an altercation with the management of a bakery shop in Karachi, Pakistan was falsely attributed to several famous bakeries across India.", "lang": "en"}
