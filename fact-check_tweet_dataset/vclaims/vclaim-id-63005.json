This is false; the chain\u2019s spokeswoman said the company does not donate to presidential candidates, and corporations are barred from directly making such donations.\n\n\u201cOlive Garden is funding Trump's re-election in 2020. It would be terrible if you shared this and Olive Garden lost business,\u201d says the May 7, 2020 post.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know where this information came from, but it is incorrect. Our company does not donate to presidential candidates,\u201d Meagan Bernstein, a spokeswoman for Olive Garden, told AFP by email.\n\nSimilar claims circulated on Twitter in 2019, including here. The company addressed the claims in a tweet.\n\nCertain types of organizations are prohibited from donating to political campaigns. But while a corporation itself cannot donate, affiliated political action committees (PACs), as well as employees and owners, can.\n\nFederal law requires that donation records identify the amount, date of receipt, and contributor\u2019s full name, mailing address, occupation and employer for each campaign contribution that exceeds $200.\n\nAccording to The Center for Responsive Politics, a research group tracking money in politics, Olive Garden\u2019s parent company Darden Restaurants did not donate to Trump\u2019s campaign through a PAC.\n\nIt does however show individual donations to Trump from people affiliated with the company, totalling $840 for the 2020 cycle. But the leading recipient of such contributions is former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, with a total of more than $23,000.", "lang": "en"}
