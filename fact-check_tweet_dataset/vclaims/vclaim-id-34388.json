Other fact-checkers have found another post misidentifying a woman wearing a pink crocheted hat during the 2017 Women\u2019s March on Washington as Karlan. Now a Dec. 5 Facebook post claims to show a photo of \"Pamela Karlan when Hillary lost.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe woman the post identifies as Karlan appears upset and is wearing an Uncle Sam-style hat and Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign logo. But the person in the image is actually Janna DeVylder, who was photographed at an election party in Australia that year.\n\nThe Des Moines Register reported in January 2017 that DeVylder grew up in Iowa and was living and working in Sydney when Clinton lost to Trump. She had voted absentee for Clinton. The picture of her watching election results quickly became a meme, and she was derided online as the \"poster child for the mentally insane Hillary snowflakes.\"", "lang": "en"}
