We wanted to continue our look at this re-emerging viral threat by examining the accuracy of Kay\u2019s claim.\n\nWhile we did not hear back from her by our deadline, we have a pretty good idea of Kay\u2019s source.\n\nThe World Health Organization, which recommends infants be vaccinated with at least one dose of the MMR vaccine before their first birthday, among 1-year-olds by country. The most recent data is for 2013.\n\nThere were 16 African countries that beat the U.S. rate of 91 percent for the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine in 2013, according to the WHO data. (The the measles immunization rate in the United States is 91.9 percent. But the WHO and CDC measure the statistic in different ways, and as you'll see, it doesn't make a difference.)\n\nThe countries besting the United States are Algeria, Botswana, Burundi, Egypt, Eritrea, Gambia, Kenya, Lesotho, Libya, Mauritius, Morocco, Rwanda, Seychelles, Tanzania, Tunisia and Zimbabwe.\n\nOf course, many African countries facing steep impoverished conditions have lower and substantially lower rates, such as Central African Republic (25 percent), Chad (59 percent), Equatorial Guinea (42 percent), Ethiopia (62 percent), Nigeria (59 percent), South Sudan (30 percent) and South Africa (66 percent).\n\nMore broadly, it\u2019s not just African countries beating the United States. Latin American countries with rates about the same as or exceeding the United States\u2019 include El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico.\n\nSouth Africa-based think tank Good Governance Africa spurred news about the United States trailing some African countries in a highlighting the WHO data. Researcher Kate van Niekerk hailed the improved availability and widespread usage of the vaccine as a \"major public health success\" that has reduced child deaths even though the disease continues to kill about 400 children every day.\n\nStill, Dr. Cathy Troisi, infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston School of Public Health, said the nearly universal use of the measles vaccine in some parts of Africa is the result of a large international effort to reduce child mortality. by two-thirds the under-five mortality rate between 1990 and 2015 was one target of the United Nations .\n\nUnlike in some regions of Africa, where measles remains a leading cause of child death, some American parents are strangers to scary, eradicated diseases that afflicted prior generations, she said. Americans also generally value individual rights over community needs, she added.\n\n\"I\u2019m old enough that I was born before the polio vaccine became available,\" Troisi said, \"and you can bet when it came out, my mom was first in line to get me vaccinated. Part of the reason we\u2019re seeing this refusal is because parents haven\u2019t seen what these diseases can do.\"\n\nBecause we were curious, we wondered how the U.S. vaccination rate stacked up against its more populous companions. The U.S. population is about , making it the third-most populated country.\n\nChina, with 1.36 billion people, is at 99 percent. India, with 1.24 billion people, has a rate of 74 percent. Indonesia, at 253 million residents, had a rate of 84 percent. Brazil and its population of more than 200 million residents had a measles vaccination rate of 99 percent.\n\nKay said, \"There are countries in Africa where they have higher vaccination rates than here in the United States.\"\n\nWe found ample evidence to back up her point, with several African countries boasting better vaccination rates than the United States. Mauritius, Tanzania and Morocco have nearly complete vaccination of 1-year-olds, according to World Health Organization data.", "lang": "en"}
