According to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, the airplane had 191 people on board, and in a statement, Air India Express confirmed the death of 18 people including both pilots.\n\nThe clip is being shared on Facebook with the caption, \"Cross winds effects landing.......Look how difficult for a Pilot to maneuver the flight!!\"\n\nClick here to view an archive.\n\nHarsh Goenka, Chairman of RPG Enterprises, also tweeted the viral clip with the caption, \"Some hair raising landings which still managed to survive a crash\". However on later being pointed out by several users that it is a simulation, Goenka replied 'of course'.\n\nClick here to view, and here for an archive.\n\nClick here to view, and here for an archive.\n\nBOOM also received the clip on its WhatsApp helpline number (7700906111)\n\nAlso Read: Video Simulation Of Air India Express Flight 1344 Crash Viral As Real\n\n\n\nBOOM found that the viral clip is taken from a flight simulator X-Plane 11 made by Laminar Research, and is not real footage of pilots landing their planes on the runway while battling crosswinds.\n\nOn observing the video, at several points, one can notice that the clip is a simulation. At the 13 seconds timestamp, one can clearly notice that aircraft's wings are going into the runway and coming out of the ground unscathed without any damage.\n\nTaking a cue from the replies to the viral clip, we searched with the keywords 'X-Plane 11' on YouTube and found that the clip has been picked from a YouTube channel that makes videos on airplanes landing using flight simulator games.\n\nWe found that the viral clip matches the video uploaded on May 1, 2020, with the caption, \"Most Crazy Emergency Landing By Drunk Pilot | X-Plane 11\". At the 3.53 minutes time stamp, the same sequence of events occur and the same names are spotted on the plane like 'Dreams Air', 'Boeing 777', and 'Garuda Indonesia'.\n\nThe YouTube channel Bopbibun had also stated below the video that it is a flight simulation and not real.\n\nBOOM has previously debunked misinformation around the Kerala plane crash as a video simulation of the Air India Express Flight 1344 was shared falsely claiming that it was the actual footage of the airplane skidding off the runway", "lang": "en"}
