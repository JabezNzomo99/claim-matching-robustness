Based on their comments, some assumed the lifting of the ban applied to their areas too. One of the FB accounts that reposted the advisory without any clarification indicated its address as \"Navotas City.\"\n\nMotorcycle \u201cback riding\u201d was banned when a large part of the country was placed under community quarantine in mid-March. This was in compliance with social distancing rules in order to reduce the possible spread of COVID-19.\n\nPalawan, and the rest of Region IV-B, are no longer under community quarantine as of May 16, according to Resolution no. 35 of the Interagency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID).\n\nOn May 18, the municipality of Brooke\u2019s Point in Palawan issued a public advisory on its FB page named COVID-19-Free Brooke's Point, announcing that back riding is now allowed in their area but \u201cexclusive only to immediate family members or live-in partners.\u201d Residents need to secure a permit from their respective barangays to do this.\n\nBack-riding on motorcycles is still not allowed in areas that remain under different levels of community quarantine.\n\nThe Land Transportation Office\u2019s Memorandum Circular No. 2020-2185 issued on May 12 reiterated that in general community quarantine (GCQ) areas, the \u201cprohibition of backride passengers for motorcycle riders shall remain.\u201d\n\nGuidelines released by the Department of Transportation on May 14 show that only one person can ride a motorcycle in areas under modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ).\n\nMotorcycle taxis, on the other hand, still cannot operate whether the quarantine has been lifted in an area or not.\n\n\u201cThe pilot study on motorcycle taxis already ended in March. Technically, in the absence of a law classifying it as a legitimate public transport mode, hindi pa sila (they are not) allowed to operate,\u201d said Goddes Libiran, Transport Assistant Secretary for Communications and Commuter Affairs, in an interview with VERA Files.\n\nThe misleading posts now have close to a thousand shares on FB, a day after they were posted.", "lang": "en"}
