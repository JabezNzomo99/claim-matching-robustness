It is being claimed in the viral post that this incident happened in Bihar where these religious books have been found in a drain. We found in our investigation that this claim is false.

This matter is still prejudice.\n\nIn this connection, we spoke to the Chief Executive Officer of Bihar Sunni Waqf Board, Dr. M A Ajazi, who said that some people spread such false rumors to harm communal harmony. Such fake news should be strongly condemned.\n\nThis post was shared by a Facebook page named \u2018Khujli To Hogi Hi\u2019.
