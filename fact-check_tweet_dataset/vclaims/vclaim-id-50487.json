Let\u2019s check the veracity of the message.\n\n\n\nClaim: Nestle company is selling Maggi with \u2018beef\u2019 flavor in India. Fact: In the Nestle India website, the range of products it sells in the country has no listing of Maggi with \u2018beef\u2019 flavor among them. It was found that \u2018Beef Flavour\u2019 Maggi (shown in the picture) is sold in countries like Australia and New Zealand. So, the claim going viral in India is MISLEADING.\n\nWhen we visited the Nestle India website to know the range of products it sells in India, Maggi with \u2018beef\u2019 flavour wasn\u2019t listed. In the non-vegetarian section, only Maggi products with \u2018chicken\u2019 flavour was featured in that listing. \n\n\n\nAnd, when a Twitter user has asked Nestle if the company is selling Maggi with \u2018beef\u2019 flavor in India, Nestle India Care has clarified that \u2018MAGGI noodles manufactured and sold by it in the country does not contain beef or any form of beef flavour.\u2019\n\nDuring the search process, it was found that the Nestle company sells beef-flavoured Maggi products (shown in the picture) in Australia and New Zealand. Maggi noodles similar to the image shared in the post is found to be sold in New Zealand.\n\nTo sum it up, the viral image of beef flavour Maggi noodles is not from India.
