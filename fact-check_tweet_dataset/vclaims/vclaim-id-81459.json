(Photo: IANS)\n\nMumbai: Two incidents of mob violence reported from Dima Hasao in Assam and Mangaluru in Karnataka on July 6, 2018, take to 61 the number of mob attacks sparked by rumours of child-lifting circulated on social media since beginning of the year.\n\nSo far this year, 24 persons have been killed in such mob attacks, an IndiaSpend analysis of news reports from across India shows. This is more than 4.5 times rise in attacks and two-fold rise in deaths of this kind over 2017, when 11 persons were killed in eight separate attacks.\n\nBetween January 1, 2017, and July 5, 2018, 33 persons have been killed and at least 99 injured in 69 reported cases. In the first six days of July alone, there have been nine cases of mob violence over child lifting rumours and five deaths, which amounts to more than one attack recorded every day.\n\nIn all cases, the victims were assaulted on mere suspicion and no evidence of child lifting was found later. So far, police across states have arrested at least 181 persons in connection with 21 cases, according to information from the news reports.\n\nOn July 5, 2018, the central home ministry had directed all states and union territories to contain mob-lynchings fuelled by rumours of child-lifting on social media. Nevertheless, two attacks were reported on July 6, 2018\u2013a father travelling with his own son in Karnataka, and three sadhus or \u2018holy men\u2019 travelling in Assam.\n\nPrior to 2017, one mob lynching was recorded in August 2012, in which a driver was killed in Patna, Bihar, on suspicion of kidnapping a minor, according to our database.\n\nThe spike in these lynchings over the past year follows a rise in bovine-related hate violence, as recorded in IndiaSpend\u2019s database on cow-related hate crime. Incidents of mob attacks on persons suspected of killing cows have become deadlier during this period, with more deaths reported in attacks.\n\nSocial and political commentators have blamed this violence on a rise in socio-political and religious cleavages, a rise of vigilantism and an apparent atmosphere of impunity for attackers.\n\n\u201cThe violence started with cow-related vigilantism but it is now building up more violent behaviour\u2013from small to big reasons anything could be the trigger,\u201d psychologist Upneet Lalli, deputy director of the Institute of Correctional Administration in Chandigarh, told IndiaSpend.\n\nVideos of people tied and beaten, begging mobs to spare their lives, have been circulating on WhatsApp groups and other social media, affecting people everywhere, she said, adding, \u201cOnce set off for any reason, mob hysteria is extremely difficult to control.\u201d\n\nSocial media is aiding and abetting the process, criminologist Vijay Raghavan, dean of the social protection office at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, told IndiaSpend, adding that the growing violence is \u201cclearly being orchestrated by vested interests\u201d.\n\n\u201cA rumour starts in one part of the country and travels to other parts like wildfire\u2013first it was beef, now it is child lifting,\u201d he said. In most cases, the victims and the attackers belong to communities historically pitted against each other, he said, \u201cThis changing narrative has a clear pattern of violence that is basically preying on traditional insider-outsider perceptions.\u201d\n\nTo analyse instances of mob violence related to child-lifting rumours, our team collected, studied and cross-verified print and online news reports in the English media, which tend to have the widest nationwide coverage, since 2010. All reported incidents were cross-referenced to eliminate discrepancies.\n\nThe dataset thus created includes the number of mob attacks, the severity of each attack and details of the victims. Most entries include the names of districts, towns and villages.\n\nSince each observation is based on a newspaper report of the crime, availability of details such as the severity of crime, the number of victims and their identities and ethnicities varies.\n\nBefore 2017, only one incident was reported in 2012.\n\nAmong all states and union territories, Jharkhand and Maharashtra, with seven and five deaths, respectively, reported the highest death toll. The chances of death in such attacks in these states stood at 350% and 167%, respectively, meaning every reported incident led to more than one death.\n\nOdisha, under the Biju Janata Dal government, reported the most number of attacks, 15, which resulted in one death. Tamil Nadu, run by the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), followed with nine cases and four deaths.\n\nOne-third or 30% of attacks were reported from states ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party, which also runs the central government.\n\nIn the 19 months since January 2017, 10 districts across 16 states have reported more than one case of mob violence. Jeypore, Mayurbhanjh and Rayagada in Odisha and Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh have reported three separate incidents each.\n\nMore than half or 56% of the attacked victims were men, 22% women, 3% transgender, and for the remaining 18%, the gender was not mentioned in the news reports.\n\nAmong those killed, 14 were Hindus, 3 Muslims, and in 16 cases the religious/ethnic identity was not reported.\n\nNo correlation between rise in reported child kidnappings and spread of mob violence\n\nExcept in Maharashtra, these incidents of violence do not reflect an increase in child kidnapping cases recorded in National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data from 2014 to 2016.\n\nIn the two years from 2014, India recorded a 41% rise in kidnapping and abduction of children\u2013from 38,555 in 2014 to 54,328 in 2016\u2013primarily in Uttar Pradesh (9,678), Maharashtra (8,260) and Delhi (6,254), NCRB data show.\n\nAs of 2016, Maharashtra, the second-most populous state in India, reported the second-highest number of child abductions. It has also reported the second-highest toll from mob lynchings over child-lifting rumours.\n\nHowever, there was no such correlation in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, which the NCRB ranked first and third for the number of reported child abductions and kidnappings (which are defined differently in law but basically involve seizing by force and against the victim\u2019s will).\n\nJharkhand, which reported the highest death toll from mob lynchings, ranked 19 across India for reported child abductions in 2016, as per NCRB data. Tripura, where five people were killed, ranked 24.\n\nThis may suggest that fears of child lifting are unfounded and exaggerated. \u201cThere is no correlation because the instigators of this violence are not prompted by a genuine fear of kidnapping,\u201d Raghavan said.\n\nHowever, the data do not account for cases that go unreported\u2013families are hesitant to approach the police, who are seen to be unsympathetic and intimidating\u2013or cases lost in communication between states and NCRB.\n\nThe violence is also indicative of how people have lost faith in law enforcement and criminal justice systems to act decisively against child lifting, Lalli said, adding, \u201cLosing faith in the law of the land is a serious threat to society.\u201d\n\nMob psyche is different from individual psyche, she said, \u201cWhen an individual acts, there is a sense of responsibility, but in a mob, there is a dispersion of responsibility and guilt.\u201d The mob justifies its act as heroism to save the community, their identity, their children, themselves.\n\nOf the children kidnapped or abducted in 2016, 73% were female and 27% male, NCRB data show. Of the total child victims, 31% (16,938) were kidnapped or abducted for the purpose of marriage, of which only one victim was male; 3% (1,562 female and 26 male) for illicit intercourse; and 1% each for other unlawful activity and adoption. No purpose was mentioned in fully 62% of cases.\n\nOf the 69 mob violence cases related to rumours of child lifting that have been reported, 77% were eventually attributed to fake news spread through social media. Mobile messenger application Whatsapp, in particular, featured as the rumour source in 28% or 19 of the cases.\n\nThe ministry of electronics and information technology on July 2, 2018, issued a warning to Whatsapp, observing that \u201cinstances of lynching of innocent people because of large number of irresponsible and explosive messages filled with rumours and provocation are being circulated on WhatsApp\u201d.\n\n\u201cSuch a platform cannot evade accountability and responsibility especially when good technological inventions are abused by some miscreants who resort to provocative messages which lead to spread of violence,\u201d the ministry said subsequently in a press release on July 3, 2018, stating clearly that \u201cWhatsApp must take immediate action to end this menace and ensure that their platform is not used for such malafide activities\u201d.\n\nAbout 13% or 200 million of WhatsApp\u2019s 1.5 billion users are Indian, The Financial Express reported on February 1, 2018. This is 42% of India\u2019s 481 million internet users recorded as of December 2017.\n\nIn a letter to the ministry shared with IndiaSpend, the WhatsApp management said it was \u201chorrified by these terrible acts of violence\u201d and listed out the steps it has taken to curb the spread of fake news but emphasised that the challenge \u201crequires government, civil society and technology companies to work together\u201d.\n\nIt maintained, however, that messages would continue to have end-to-end encryption to protect users\u2019 privacy and security, encryption being key to WhatsApp\u2019s messaging service. It added that no more than a quarter of WhatsApp users are part of groups; that the majority of groups are small (with fewer than 10 members); and nine in 10 messages are sent from just one person to another.\n\nCyber privacy experts caution against overreacting against WhatsApp and other social media platforms, arguing in favour of free speech and privacy.\n\nIn June, after two cases of mob lynching in Tripura, the government tried to control the situation by shutting down the internet in the area, reports included in our database said.\n\nThis is \u201ca slippery slope to quell dissent\u201d, Swaraj Barooah, director at the Centre for Internet and Society, a Bengaluru-based not-for-profit, said, adding, \u201cThere are indications that marginalised groups tend to be affected more strongly than others when there are internet shutdowns.\u201d\n\nLynchings point to a much larger issue than the ubiquitous presence of social media, experts said. \u201cEveryone is focusing on these being rumours\u2013and of course the platform\u2019s ability to exponentially magnify the speed and reach of a message being sent is very relevant\u2013but when and why did we normalise vigilante justice in the first place?\u201d said Barooah. \u201cFor instance, would this type of action be okay if these were not rumours, but had actually been true?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe root problem is those exploiting historical animosities between communities. We need to properly investigate on a national-level who are the instigators and what are they after\u2013merely arresting people after an incident is not enough,\u201d professor Raghavan said.\n\nBarooah also warned against attempts to force WhatsApp to provide security agencies with decrypted data, as the government had forced the Canadian smartphone maker Blackberry to do in 2013.\n\n\u201cGiven that it is already unsure of the extent to which WhatsApp shares metadata with governments, it is important to ensure that its end-to-end encryption facility is not weakened,\u201d Barooah said. \u201cThere are certain delicate trade-offs that can be made, but if they are, they should not be made as a knee-jerk reaction to ongoing events but after careful consideration of all the pitfalls. This is especially important in India, given the lack of a privacy law as well as concerns of chilling effects on free speech that are present.\u201d\n\nSome solutions he suggested include making it mandatory that WhatsApp forwards and memes contain originator details, and that a \u201cfact check this\u201d option be inserted at the user end to allow a message to be decrypted. He also suggested that a database of \u2018reported hashes\u2019 be created, which all users could download, and which would automatically rate messages on \u2018trust\u2019.\n\nIt is also important to help people identify fake news and question the information they receive, experts say, pointing out that while India has low literacy and education levels, even highly literate people are not free from confirmation bias.\n\n\u201cWe really need to educate people\u2013people naively believe everything they read as true. We\u2019re not doing anything about critical thinking and critical inquiry\u2013we\u2019ve stopped being questioning and that\u2019s a very important part of countering fake news,\u201d Lalli said, adding, \u201cWe don\u2019t even respond to information, we\u2019re only reacting.\u201d\n\nHow recent attacks tie in with bovine-related vigilantism and violence\n\nIndiaSpend has been maintaining a database of bovine-related violence since 2010, which shows a spurt in violence since the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi assumed power in May 2014.\n\nA preponderant majority of bovine-related hate crimes\u201398% of the 85 incidents\u2013have occurred since May 2014, our database shows. Only one incident each was reported in 2012 and 2013.\n\nAround 56% of the persons attacked by these groups were Muslim, who accounted for 88% of those killed in this violence. In 2018, 100% of victims attacked in these hate crimes were Muslim.\n\n\u201cThere is a clear increase in aggression by one group against the other and a growing inability to empathise and understand those different from ourselves,\u201d Lalli said, \u201cThis has essentially made us revert to behaving like tribalistic societies with animalistic instincts\u2013where, when for survival, when you perceive an animal to be a threat, you attack it to kill it.\u201d\n\nIn more than a third\u201328 of 85 incidents\u2013mobs or groups of people were spurred into violence on the mere suspicion of cow slaughter.\n\nOur database also shows that the attacks have become deadlier\u2013the percentage chance of such mob-violence resulting in death has more than doubled from 30% in 2017\u2013regarded as the deadliest year since 2010 (11 deaths in 37 cases)\u2013to 66% in 2018 (four deaths in six cases).\n\n\u201cSociety has an innate capacity for violence and it\u2019s very easy to encourage this. Right from Twitter trolling\u2013which is basically extreme verbal aggression\u2013we are unleashing and encouraging violence in different ways and contexts,\u201d Lalli said.\n\nWhat the government says\n\nMany commentators have remarked that the absence of a strict and prompt response from the government has encouraged such violence. \u201cWhat action is taken when such cases occur has an important bearing on the continuation of such violence,\u201d Raghavan said, \u201cBy not taking strong action, the state is complicit in its orchestration.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we hear about more incidents of violence, we are yet to hear full recognition or condemnation of these acts from the important leaders\u2013in a way it sends out a message that does not discourage the mob,\u201d Lalli agreed, \u201cWhen you don\u2019t speak out about it and come down on it strongly, it sends out a signal to society that it\u2019s alright to resort to violence for these reasons since nobody gets punished.\u201d\n\nThe NCRB \u201cdoes not maintain specific data with respect to mob lynching incidents (involving minorities) in the country\u201d, the home ministry told Parliament on March 13, 2018.\n\nThe ministry did furnish some data on mob lynchings recorded by states from 2014 to 2017, but did not provide information on the motive\u2013whether cow vigilantism, communal or caste hatred, or rumours of child-lifting, etc. The data also did not disclose the identity of the victims.\n\nThese data said 45 persons were killed in 40 cases of mob lynching across nine states between 2014 and March 3, 2018. At least 217 persons have been arrested.\n\nIn contrast, IndiaSpend\u2019s two databases on mob violence\u2013due to child-lifting rumours and bovine-related hate violence\u2013record 80 cases and 41 deaths during the same period. This is without counting other instances of mob violence related to caste, moral policing and so on.\n\nThis article was first published on IndiaSpend.com.", "lang": "en"}
