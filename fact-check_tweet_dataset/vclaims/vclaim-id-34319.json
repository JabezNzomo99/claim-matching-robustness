Many of them have previously been fact-checked by The New York Times and found false, including his claim that Ukraine, rather than Russia, was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee in 2016; his accusation that the Obama administration wiretapped him; and his characterization of the whistle-blower\u2019s report as baseless. Here\u2019s a check of some of his newer assertions. \u201cHe made up a phone call, and then when I released it, everybody was embarrassed.\u201d False. Mr. Trump was referring to statements Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, made about the president\u2019s July 25 phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. But Mr. Trump\u2019s timeline is scrambled. A day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry on Sept. 24, the White House released the reconstructed transcript of Mr. Trump\u2019s call with Mr. Zelensky. The following day, Mr. Schiff opened a congressional hearing with a characterization of the transcript. He did not claim to be reciting from the White House transcript, but said he was conferring \u201cthe essence\u201d of the conversation, \u201cshorn of its rambling character and in not so many words.\u201d\n\nSo Mr. Schiff\u2019s account of the call came after Mr. Trump released the reconstructed transcript, not before, and while Mr. Schiff took some liberties in the way he recounted the July 25 call, his characterization generally stuck to the actual substance of the conversation. Mr. Trump has at other times acknowledged that Mr. Schiff\u2019s account of the call came after the release of the transcript. At a campaign rally in October, he said Mr. Schiff \u201chad to make up a fake conversation\u201d because the transcript of the actual call was \u201cso good.\u201d \u201cI know Ukrainian people. They\u2019re great people. But it\u2019s known as being the third most corrupt country in the world.\u201d This is exaggerated. Mr. Trump has often claimed that he withheld military aid to Ukraine because he was concerned about corruption. The statistic he offered to prove this point, however, is not quite accurate. Transparency International ranked Ukraine at No. 120 out of 180 countries in its 2018 Corruption Perceptions Index, which is based on 13 global data sources on development. Ukraine also ranked at No. 120 in 2017, but its score improved by two points. (The three most corrupt countries in 2018 were Somalia, Syria and South Sudan. Seven countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia had lower rankings than Ukraine.)\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s insistence that he was focused on corruption also lacks support. For one, he did not raise those concerns during his July 25 call with Mr. Zelensky or in an April 21 call. The Pentagon had also certified in May that Ukraine had \u201ctaken substantive actions\u201d to root out corruption. The military aid to Ukraine was withheld in July and released on Sept. 11, but neither Mr. Trump nor his aides have specified what corruption improvements had been made in Kyiv in those two months. \u201cHow about the guy with the telephone? How about that one? I guarantee you that never took place.\u201d This is disputed. David Holmes, the political counselor at the United States Embassy in Ukraine, testified on Thursday that he had overheard a cellphone call between Mr. Trump and Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, in July. During the call, Mr. Holmes said, Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Sondland about Ukrainian investigations into his political rivals. Mr. Holmes testified that he provided an account of the call to his boss immediately afterward and also informed other colleagues at the embassy in Kyiv. Though Mr. Trump insisted Mr. Holmes\u2019s account was wrong, Mr. Sondland said Wednesday in congressional testimony that he had \u201cno reason\u201d to doubt it, though he could not recall precise details of their conversation. \u201cIt\u2019s true that the president speaks loudly at times, and it\u2019s also true \u2014 I think we primarily discussed ASAP Rocky,\u201d Mr. Sondland said, referring to the American rapper who was charged with assault in Sweden around that time. \u201cActually, actually, I would have been more surprised if President Trump had not mentioned investigations, particularly given what we were hearing from Mr. Giuliani about the president\u2019s concerns,\u201d he said, referring to Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer. \u201cHowever, I have no recollection of discussing Vice President Biden or his son on that call or after the call ended.\u201d \u201cThis was an Obama person. Wouldn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t want to hang my picture in the embassy.\u201d This lacks evidence. The president was referring to Marie L. Yovanovitch, a career diplomat who served as the United States ambassador to Ukraine until he recalled her this spring. She had come under intense criticism from allies of Mr. Trump, including Mr. Giuliani and Donald Trump Jr., who helped spread accusations that Ms. Yovanovitch was insufficiently loyal to the president. She has become a witness in the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Trump\u2019s remark about his portrait may have been drawn from an exchange between Representative Lee M. Zeldin, Republican of New York, and Mr. Holmes during closed congressional testimony last week.\n\nMr. Zeldin asked Mr. Holmes if it was true that there was no official portrait of Mr. Trump hanging inside the United States Embassy in Kyiv by August 2017. Mr. Holmes replied that he could not recall. But the White House did not release the portraits of Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for distribution in federal facilities until Oct. 31, 2017. Lawyers for Ms. Yovanovitch disputed Mr. Trump\u2019s claim, according to the NBC reporter Geoff Bennett, and said the embassy in Kyiv hung his portrait, along with Mr. Pence\u2019s and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s, \u201cas soon as they arrived.\u201d Mr. Trump was also wrong to characterize Ms. Yovanovitch as an \u201cObama person.\u201d She has served as an ambassador under presidents of both parties. She was first appointed as an ambassador to Kyrgyzstan and Armenia by President George W. Bush and was sent to Ukraine by President Barack Obama. \u201cNancy Pelosi\u2019s totally incompetent. She\u2019s lost, absolutely lost. She doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing. She hasn\u2019t done anything. She can\u2019t get anything approved.\u201d False. Mr. Trump has a point that the current divided Congress hasn\u2019t exactly been productive compared with years past, but he is wrong to say Speaker Nancy Pelosi has done nothing at all. Congress has enacted 69 pieces of legislation into law since January, and about a dozen since the impeachment inquiry began, including a stopgap spending bill on Thursday. The House, for its part, passed or agreed to 568 bills or resolutions, more than 100 of which were acted upon since the impeachment inquiry began. Ms. Pelosi, in a news conference on Thursday, highlighted a bipartisan resolution supporting pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong that passed both chambers but has not yet been signed by Mr. Trump. She also faulted Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, for failing to take up legislation passed by the House on background checks for gun purchases, anti-domestic violence, immigration and a host of other issues.", "lang": "en"}
