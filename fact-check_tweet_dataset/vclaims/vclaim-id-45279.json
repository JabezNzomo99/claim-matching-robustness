The above-displayed image was originally shared on Twitter by Aaron Blake, a senior political reporter with The Washington Post. Blake forwarded a copy of this email to us so that we could verify that this message was truly sent by an email address (contact@action.gop.com) connected to Trump\u2019s re-election bid.\n\nThe email featured a link to a WinRed URL, a fundraising platform endorsed by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, which contained a similar message informing people that they could receive a \u201cCamo Keep America Great\u201d hat by joining the Trump Army. The WinRed site stated that all donations will benefit the \u201cTrump Make America Great Again Committee,\u201d one of the campaign\u2019s fundraising committees:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s appalling to see President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign trying to exploit our nation\u2019s crisis during these trying times and incite division. The campaign is not only taking advantage of people\u2019s current fears and insecurities, but, by using language that pins Americans against each other, they are inciting violence against the same people Trump swore to serve.\u201d\n\nWhile many people encountered the \u201cTrump Army\u201d for the first time due to Blake\u2019s tweet on June 4, 2020, this is not the first time that this language has accompanied a fundraising email for the Trump campaign. The Twitter account @TrumpEmail, a social media account that archives Trump fundraising emails, shared a similar message that was sent out circa May 5, 2020.\n\n\u201cThe Trump Army is made up of the President\u2019s fiercest defenders who are willing to go to battle with the Left-wing MOB whenever they come after us. Just take a look at everything they\u2019ve fought for so far:\u201d\n\nAfter Blake\u2019s tweet went viral, @TrumpEmail reported that they had received at least four emails containing the words \u201cTrump Army\u201d since March 2020:\n\nOn March 2, 2020, the Trump Campaign put out a press release announcing the launch of Army for Trump, \u201ca website dedicated to recruiting and mobilizing Americans across the country who are committed to fighting to re-elect President Trump.\u201d While the Army for Trump website does use some military terms (they ask supporters to \u201cenlist\u201d for campaign updates, instead of \u201cjoin\u201d or \u201cregister\u201d), the website\u2019s main objective is to \u201cprovide a one-stop online destination to get involved with President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, allowing people to become a volunteer or activist in communities throughout the country.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
