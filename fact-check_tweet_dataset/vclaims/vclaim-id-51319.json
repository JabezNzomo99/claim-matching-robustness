Ralph Northam declared a temporary state of emergency ahead of a pro-gun rally at the state Capitol in Richmond on MLK day in 2020.\n\nSome Snopes.com readers asked whether the emergency order was real. It was.\n\nAccording to news reports, protests at that Capitol are an annual event known as Lobby Day, in which \u201ccitizen activists, including those on both sides of the gun debate, converge on the Capitol to press issues directly to lawmakers.\u201d This year was different, however, because for the first time in a generation, voters handed the Virginia Legislature to a Democratic majority. Lawmakers have stated they will take the opportunity to pass gun regulations, sparking a conservative backlash.\n\nThe organizer of the Jan. 20 rally is a self-described extremist, but had stated his intent to keep the event peaceful. Nevertheless, Northam expressed concern over fears that armed militia members planned to \u201cstorm the capitol.\u201d\n\nTactical gear-clad, gun-toting demonstrators gathered outside security perimeters, but no violence was reported at the rally. Officials estimated about 22,000 attended.\n\nAhead of the event, the FBI had arrested six men allegedly connected to a white supremacist organization known as \u201cthe Base\u201d in Delaware, Maryland, and Georgia. Three of those men allegedly had discussed opening fire during the Richmond gun rally for the purpose of creating chaos.\n\nThe executive order banned firearms on Capitol grounds and activated emergency services, noting, \u201cThe events that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia demonstrated what can happen when peaceful demonstrations are hijacked by those who come into the Commonwealth and do not value the importance of peaceful assembly. We lost three Virginians. We must take all precautions to prevent that from ever happening again.\u201d\n\nThe executive order also noted that some of the intelligence gathered by law enforcement echoed sentiments in the days leading up to Charlottesville: \u201cAvailable information suggests that a substantial number of these demonstrators are expected to come from outside the Commonwealth, may be armed, and have as their purpose not peaceful assembly but violence, rioting, and insurrection.\u201d\n\nIn August 2017, white supremacist demonstrators gathered in Charlottesville for a \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally. Three people died during the event, including counter-protester Heather Heyer, who was struck by a car driven by a white supremacist who rammed it into a crowd. Two Virginia state troopers were killed when the helicopter they were flying to monitor the crowds crashed.", "lang": "en"}
