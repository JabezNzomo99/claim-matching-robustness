I promise you, you\u2019ll be cured of the desire to burn a flag ever again. You\u2019ll be waving in, saluting it, or lying under it.\u201d It also carried the words, \u201cThis should be implemented in our country too\u201d \u2013 suggesting that regulation punishing citizens for burning the American flag by enrolling them in the military exists in the US.\n\nGambhir\u2019s tweet was liked over 12,000 times and retweeted nearly 2,500 times at the time of writing this article. It is noteworthy that the infographic shared by the BJP MP adorned a \u2018Mahesh Vikram Hegde\u2019 stamp \u2013 the man behind the infamous fake news portal Postcard News. Hegde has been arrested twice in the past by the Karnataka police for spreading misinformation.\n\nDid James Mattis ever make such a statement?\n\nWe tried looking for news reports that might have quoted the former US Defense Secretary as saying that flag burners will have to serve two years in the military. None exist.\n\nA reverse-search of the infographic led us to a website that shares memes. The website had picked up a 2017 post from a Facebook page \u2018Right-Winged Birds of Pray\u2019 which clearly mentions that the quote isn\u2019t an official statement given by Mattis. \u201cNot an official quote. Just an awesome idea featuring legendary Marine, and now Secretary of Defense, Mattis,\u201d reads the caption.\n\nJames Mattis had resigned as the Defense Secretary last year. The post was made in 2017 when he was serving in the government. The infographic shared by Gautam Gambhir is a replica of this post except for the image of Mattis used by Hegde to create the copy.\n\nIn short, former US Secretary of Defense and military veteran James Mattis never said that individuals who burn the American flag should be enrolled in the military for two years.\n\nIs there an existing law in the US against burning the American flag?\n\nPresident Donald Trump had recently endorsed the Republican party\u2019s proposal to implement a ban on burning the American flag. This itself serves as evidence that the country does not have an anti-flag burning law in place.\n\nIn 2016, the President had tweeted that igniting the American flag must have consequences \u201cperhaps\u201d loss of citizenship or incarceration. Trump\u2019s tweet suggested that US law does not penalise citizens for setting ablaze the national flag, however, such regulation should be implemented.\n\nThe United States has the Federal Flag Code that provides guidelines for the display and respect of the American flag but the law neither has enforcement provisions nor penalties for non-compliance. For a better understanding, we have to look into the history of how the country has dealt with the burning of the national flag through the years.\n\nThe US\u2019s involvement in the Vietnam War was met with mass protests at home that spanned across ten years, starting in 1964. To oppose the brutality of the war, protestors set fire to the American flag several times to voice resistance and demand that the government calls back its troops. Reacting to the protests, the US government approved the Federal Flag Desecration Law which laid down criminal penalties for the desecration of the national flag.\n\nIn 1989, a Texas man Gregory Lee Johnson was convicted of \u201cdesecration of a venerated object in violation of a Texas statute\u201d for burning the American flag to protest against the Reagan administration and some Dallas-based corporations. In the landmark judgement of Texas v. Johnson, the US Supreme Court held that \u201cJohnson\u2019s conviction for flag desecration is inconsistent with the First Amendment,\u201d which means that the court recognised flag burning as freedom of expression guaranteed by the US Constitution.\n\nIn response to the Johnson ruling, which was only applicable to the state of Texas, the US Congress enacted the anti-flag burning law Flag Protection Act of 1989 which \u201cfined or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both\u201d the violators of the law. After citizens were arrested and charged under the revised statute, the Supreme Court again held the law unconstitutional in the United States v. Eichman ruling of 1990.\n\nThroughout history, there have been attempts to bring in laws that would allow the US Congress to prohibit flag desecration but none of these is enforceable. In plain language, desecration of the US flag, including its burning, is protected under the First Amendment of the US Constitution. Citizens can, however, be convicted if a stolen flag is burnt or the fire causes damage to property.\n\nBJP MP Gautam Gambhir, therefore, shared an infographic that was factually incorrect on all counts. Not only is the burning of the US flag permitted by law but former Defense Secretary James Mattis never said that those who set fire to the flag should be forced to serve in the US military for two years.", "lang": "en"}
