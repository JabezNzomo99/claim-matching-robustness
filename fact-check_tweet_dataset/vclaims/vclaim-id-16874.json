The crude, handmade prosthesis, comprising both upper and lower teeth, is displayed in a circular glass case permitting a 360-degree view. The majority of Mount Vernon\u2019s one million visitors per year, one presumes, pause to stare at the famous choppers for at least a moment before moving on to the table settings.\n\nThe fascination with George Washington\u2019s false teeth could be attributable to various factors \u2014 that they\u2019re a medical curiosity from the 18th century, when dentistry was still just this side of barbaric; that they\u2019re an intimate vestige of the man himself, letting us feel closer to him; or, maybe, that we\u2019re all just eager to see if the scuttlebutt we heard and repeated as kids is true: that the Father of Our Country had wooden teeth.\n\nThe exhibit does not disappoint. One look at the contraption itself, which is actually made out of metal, ivory, and real teeth (both animal and human), is enough to see that it wasn\u2019t carved out of wood:\n\nPlus, there\u2019s a plaque that lays out the facts in black and white:\n\nAs was common at the time, the dentures were ill-fitting, awkward, and sometimes painful. They distorted Washington\u2019s appearance, mainly by making his lower lip protrude, as can be seen in contemporaneous portraiture of the first president. According to historian Michael Beschloss, his teeth were an embarrassment to him:\n\nHe once pleaded with his dentist, John Greenwood, by letter, to avoid any change to the denture \u201cwhich will, in the least degree force the lips out more than now do, as it does this too much already.\u201d Members of his cabinet sadly noted how rarely the tight-lipped president smiled or laughed. Others insisted that his embarrassment about his dentures, which sometimes caused him to hiss as he spoke, made him reclusive.\n\nWashington was plagued by dental problems throughout most of his adult life. He attributed the misfortune to \u201ccracking of walnuts in his youth,\u201d his friend John Adams wrote, though heredity must have played a part, as well. Bad hygiene, too, though Washington wouldn\u2019t have been entirely to blame. \u201cIt\u2019s not that George Washington was sloppy about dental hygiene,\u201d John L. Smith notes in Journal of the American Revolution, \u201cit\u2019s just that dental hygiene was practically non-existent in the late eighteenth century\u201d:\n\nIn fact, in some social groups, taking care of your teeth was even considered effeminate or vain. But Washington was very wise about the message an image can send, and knew that in the Continental Congress, and as commander-in-chief and president, he had to look the part of a leader \u2026 which meant at least having teeth. Aside from the possible constant pain Washington endured from his bad teeth, he stayed on a constant life quest to (simply said) \u2014 have teeth in his mouth. And he paid a lot for professional dental care all through his lifetime.\n\nGeorge Washington wore several different sets of dentures over the course of his lifetime, none made of wood. Instead, the dentists treating him would have used the cutting-edge materials of the time: bone, ivory, lead, brass, gold, and the castaway teeth of horses, donkeys, cows, and, yes, human beings. Washington is said to have saved his own extracted teeth for future use in dentures. A longstanding rumor that Washington purchased teeth from his slaves may be true, as well, Michael Beschloss writes:\n\nAs to how and why the rumor of Washington\u2019s wooden teeth took hold in the first place, no one knows for sure, but there are two main theories, both based on the assumption that his dentures must have looked like they were made of wood. One holds that they turned mottled and brown with age, the other that their \u201cwoodiness\u201d was due to Washington\u2019s habit of drinking fortified wine:\n\nTwo hundred fifty years later, we\u2019re still talking about Washington\u2019s \u201cwooden teeth.\u201d Like the cherry tree he never chopped down as a child, they are forever enshrined in American legend.", "lang": "en"}
