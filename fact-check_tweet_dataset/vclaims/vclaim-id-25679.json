Tusk also referred to a previous call by Trump for Russia\u2019s readmission to the forum.\n\n\u201cOne year ago, in Canada, President Trump suggested re-inviting Russia to G7, stating openly that Crimea\u2019s annexation by Russia was partially justified. And that we should accept this fact,\u201d said Tusk.\n\n\u201cUnder no condition can we agree with this logic.\u201d\n\nTusk said Russia had failed to rectify the factors leading to the G8 suspension, while new reasons justified Russia\u2019s continued exclusion, including Moscow\u2019s detention of 24 Ukrainian sailors who, along with their three ships, were captured last November while heading to the Kerch Strait, the only passage between the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov.\n\nTusk added it would be better to invite Ukraine\u2019s president to the next G7 meeting, prompting a response by Russian-state broadcaster RT.\n\n\u201cTusk\u2019s logic was based on the fact that Russia does not \u2018deserve\u2019 politically to be readmitted to the Group of Seven, also because of the incident in the Azov Sea, when three Ukrainian Navy ships violated Russian territorial waters and provoked an hours-long standoff,\u201d RT wrote.\n\n\u201cHow this made Kyiv more suitable to be invited to the club of leading economies, even as a guest, Tusk did not explain. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in 2018 Ukraine was ranked as Europe\u2019s poorest country and took 162nd position among 227 world nations in terms of GDP per capita.\u201d\n\nThe RT report, however, both misrepresents the Kerch incident while also omitting key aspects of Tusk\u2019s comments, which themselves tie into what the G7 constitutes as a forum.\n\nFirst, there is no evidence Ukraine violated Russia\u2019s territorial waters. While international law in regards to navigating the Kerch Straight and the Sea of Azov is murky, Russia\u2019s right to Crimea (and thus the waters surrounding it) are not recognized. Speaking with Polygraph.info in April, G\u00fcnther Handl, a professor of international law at Tulane University, said that Ukraine is essentially moving through its own internal waters when traversing the Sea of Azov and Kerch Strait.\n\nHandl added that the legal status of Crimea could be immaterial, as the regime of innocent passage or transit passage should have applied to the Ukrainian vessels, making any Russian attempts to police the waters illegal.\n\nIn May, the UN-mandated International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea ruled that Russia must immediately release the Ukrainian ships and sailors.\n\nNext, Tusk made his logic backing Ukraine\u2019s presence at the next G7 summit over Russia\u2019s explicit in the portion of his comments RT withheld from the report.\n\n\u201cWhen Russia was invited to G7 for the first time, it was believed that it would pursue the path of liberal democracy, rule of law, and human rights,\u201d Tusk said. \u201cIs there anyone among us, who can say with full conviction, not out of business calculation, that Russia is on that path?\u201d\n\nIt was within this context that Tusk said inviting Ukraine (\u201cas a guest, of course\u201d) would be more appropriate than inviting Russia.\n\nMoreover, Russia\u2019s actual admission into the G8 was based on political and not economic considerations.\n\n\u201cIn 1998, under President Bill Clinton, Russia was accepted into the G7, transforming this informal bloc of the wealthiest democracies into the G8. The U.S. Department of the Treasury then coordinated with the economic and financial ministries of other member countries to integrate Russia, which at that time had a small economy and large foreign debt, into the global economic system.\u201d\n\nIn 1998, Russia\u2019s economy collapsed, with its GDP contracting 5.3% year-on-year to 271 billion dollars, with GDP per capita hitting its lowest level in the history of the Russian Federation.\n\nEven as its economic fortunes would improve, the Russian Federation has never been a major advanced economy, as defined by International Monetary Fund criteria.\n\nWriting for the Brookings Institute in 2006, former Deputy Secretary of State Strob Talbott noted the following:\n\n \n\n \u201cBack in 1998, leaders of what was then the G7 invited Boris Yeltsin to join their ranks. They hoped to encourage Russia to keep moving toward building a pluralistic political system, strengthening the rule of law, ensuring an independent judiciary and integrating with the global economy \u2014 principles that were written into joint statements.\u201d\n\nThat view was mirrored by E. Wayne Merry, a Senior Fellow for Europe and Eurasia at the American Foreign Policy Council.\n\n\u201cG8 membership was given to Russia not because it qualified, but to encourage Moscow\u2019s adherence to Western political standards and economic practices as it sought to rebuild itself following the collapse of the Soviet state,\u201d Merry wrote. Merry noted that Moscow itself had \u201clobbied hard for full admission\u201d to the G8 as \u201cacknowledgement of post-Soviet Russia\u2019s democratic transformation.\u201d\n\nHe added that as an informal body with no founding charter, permanent secretariat nor status within the UN system, \u201cthe G8 was what its members collectively chose it to be, existing and functioning because leaders of a small group of governments willed it so.\u201d\n\nThe same logic applies to the G7.\n\nTusk\u2019s comments regarding Ukraine\u2019s greater suitability to be invited to the next G7 summit, as a guest, were not based on the size of the country\u2019s economy or its economic development. Along with referring to Russian aggression, Tusk said he wanted \u201cto hear the opinion of the new president.\"\n\nTusk is referring to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, whose victory in the 2019 presidential election was proceeded by a smooth transfer of power, which was hailed as a \u201cgreat achievement.\u201d\n\nPolygraph.info therefore finds RT\u2019s comments to be misleading.", "lang": "en"}
