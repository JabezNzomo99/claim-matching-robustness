Shortly after the president\u2019s remarks, a photo of an injured border patrol agent from 2010 began circulating online \u2014 with a caption that amplifies Trump\u2019s false claim.\n\nThe picture shows a U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer, wearing a green uniform, with a bloodied face. It has been shared more than 7,000 times in less than 24 hours on Facebook with this caption: \u201cThis is what\u2019s going on folks. A Border agent was hit by rock throwing from the other side[.]\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not true. The photo was taken in 2010, according to Rod Kise, spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The officer in the picture was wounded by a rock thrown by drug smugglers in the Rio Grande Valley near the border patrol\u2019s McAllen Station, Kise said. That is about 1,500 miles and two states away from where the encounter between migrants and border patrol agents happened on Nov. 25.\n\nThat photo has been used online for years. It was posted by a site called Homeland Security Today in 2013 and has appeared on the popular conservative news site, Breitbart, at least twice since then.\n\nNot only is the photo eight years old, the message it sends in the most recent adaptation is wrong. No U.S. border patrol agents were seriously injured when some migrants rushed the border and were met with tear gas on Nov. 25 at the border crossing between San Diego and Tijuana.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said: \u201cU.S. Customs and Border Protection agents and officers in San Diego effectively managed an extremely dangerous situation involving over 1,000 individuals who sought to enter the U.S. unlawfully in large groups. They did so safely and without any reported serious injuries on either side of the border\u2026 Four agents were hit with rocks, but were wearing protective gear and did not suffer serious injuries.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement on Facebook that \u201cno one was injured\u201d during the border skirmish.\n\nUpdate, Nov. 29: Rod Kise, spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told us on Nov. 29 that the photo was actually taken in 2010, not 2013 as he had originally thought. We updated the headline to say that the photo is eight years old, not five years old, and corrected the year in the story.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cRemarks by President Trump at FIRST STEP Act Roundtable with Governor Bryant and Law Enforcement Leaders.\u201d Transcript.
