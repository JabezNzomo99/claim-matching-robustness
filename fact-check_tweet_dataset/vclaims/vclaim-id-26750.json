Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Benefits of Rs. 80,000 by EPFO to workers who worked between the years 1990 and 2019. Fact: EPFO has tweeted asking users to be beware of the fraudulent websites and posted the screenshots of the website which claimed that workers can get benefits of Rs. 80,000. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn clicking the link given in the post, the website with the url: https://socialdraw.top/epf/ gets opened. All the government websites generally have the domain \u2018.gov.in\u2019 but the above website has \u2018.top\u2019. Also, the website asks to share a message on WhatsApp to avail the benefits. No government website asks people to share messages on WhatsApp to receive benefits. \n\n\n\nOn Twitter, EPFO has tweeted asking users to be beware of the fraudulent websites and posted the screenshots of the above website.\n\nAlso, on opening the official website (https://www.epfindia.gov.in) of EPFO, a pop-up comes with the message that \u2018https://www.epfindia.gov.in\u2019 is the only official website of EPFO.\n\nIt was also found that similar messages went viral last year in India and this year in South Africa. The clarification given by the South African government to their citizens can be read here.\n\nTo sum it up, fake website falsely claims that workers will receive benefits of Rs. 80,000 from EPFO.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
