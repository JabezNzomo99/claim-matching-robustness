Gretchen Whitmer continues to be criticized personally over her stay-at-home orders in response to the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 even when she\u2019s relaxing them.\n\nSocial media posts have questioned how faithfully she\u2019s following her own orders and guidance. We rated as False a claim that the governor was with her family on May 20 at her second home. Also False was a claim that Whitmer was on Mackinac Island, a popular Michigan vacation spot, on May 24, \"ignoring mask and social distancing rules.\"\n\nWith the rules now relaxed in some areas, the governor\u2019s motives, too, are coming under question. A May 20 Facebook post claimed: \"So, the governor opened up Traverse City so she could have her daughter's open house this weekend. Imagine that.\"\n\nThe post (archived here) was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWhitmer issued an executive order on May 18 that partially opened two sparsely populated regions, effective May 22. The order applied to the entire Upper Peninsula and the northern reaches of the Lower Peninsula.\n\nThe latter region, referred to as the \"Traverse City Region\" in the state\u2019s reopening plan, includes Traverse City, a tourism hub located on a bay near the Lake Michigan shoreline, about 180 miles northwest of the capital, Lansing.\n\nThe order allowed for the opening of retail stores, restaurants, bars and some offices, and permitted social gatherings of up to 10 people. But it also included restrictions, such as limiting restaurant seating to 50% of normal capacity.\n\nWhitmer and her husband, Marc Mallory, have five children \u2014 including Whitmer\u2019s older daughter, Sydney Shrewsbury, a graduating high school senior. The couple own a vacation home in the Traverse City region.\n\nBut Whitmer\u2019s spokeswoman, Tiffany Brown, said there was no family graduation party held in the Traverse City area over the weekend of May 23-24 and that the governor was not in the area.\n\nThere is some evidence that Mallory could have been at the couple\u2019s vacation home in Elk Rapids, 17 miles northeast of Traverse City, on May 20, the date of the Facebook post. Using public records searches and Google Earth, we confirmed that the car in a published photo belongs to Mallory, and the house is the family\u2019s property on Birch Lake.\n\nThe Detroit News reported that the owner of NorthShore Dock LLC, a company near Birch Lake, said in Facebook posts that Mallory had called to try to get his boat in the water before the Memorial Day weekend, despite a heavy backlog.\n\nWhitmer said that Mallory was joking on the call when he asked whether his status as the governor\u2019s husband would help get his boat in the water.\n\nA Facebook post said Whitmer relaxed stay-at-home rules in Traverse City in time for Memorial Day weekend so she could have her daughter\u2019s open house.\n\nWhitmer relaxed stay-at-home rules in the region, but her office said she did not have a family event there and was not in the region that weekend.", "lang": "en"}
