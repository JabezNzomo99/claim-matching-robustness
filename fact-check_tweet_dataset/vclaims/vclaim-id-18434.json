We would have preferred a situation whereby at least 35 per cent of the list is made up of women.\n\nAsked if Buhari had broken his promise to make women 35% of his appointments, she said, \u201cYes, I would say so. Although he hasn\u2019t given reasons why he did that, in my opinion, he didn\u2019t fulfill his promise.\u201d\n\nDr. Thomas-Wilson Ikubese, Ex-presidential aspirant and Convener of YesWeFit Revolutionary Movement also says that Buhari has, through his ministerial list, betrayed his promise to Nigerians on his government\u2019s \u201cgender friendliness\u201d by not keeping to his promise of 35% appointive positions for women.\n\nHe said: \u201cPresident Buhari, in March 2015, had vowed to implement the 2005 National Gender Policy, which stipulated 35 per cent appointive positions for women, only to appoint 6 females out of the 36 Ministers, making up 16.7% females into his cabinet then.\n\n\u201cThe President repeated this promise during his 2019 re-election bid, only to end up appointing 7 females out of a total number of 43 appointments, coming up to 16.9%, in betrayal of his earlier affirmation.\u201d\n\nIn November 2018, President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s Campaign Organisation launched his re-election campaign manifesto of \u2018Next Level\u2019 and according to the document, the president sought votes to pursue a five-pronged agenda if re-elected.\n\nIn a chart titled \u2018Next Level road map\u2019 shared via the campaign Twitter handle, Buhari\u2019s plans include jobs, political inclusion, amongst others.\n\nThe political inclusion component promises to implement the 2005 National Gender Policy that stipulated at least 30% appointive positions for women. It states: increase to 30% of women ministers, commissioners, permanent secretaries, directors in all public sector ministries/institutions and affirmative action policies of at least 30% representation of women in governance implemented at the National and at least a third of the States. In fact, a 35% Affirmative Action Bill was earlier introduced in 2017 but was rejected by the 8th National Assembly.\n\nWhat you would note is that although the President promises to ensure 35% of his appointments go to females, he did not say the 35% will all be through ministerial appointments.\n\nOr that there would be 35% reflection in every group of sectoral appointments he makes.\n\nIt is safe to conclude therefore that what the document means is that his cumulative appointments at all levels and in other departments or agencies would be in the ratio of 35% of women, to 65% of men.\n\nWe will need to wait this one out before concluding on the President\u2019s gender policy implementation.\n\nEbere Agozie is a Senior Correspondent with the News Agency of Nigeria(NAN) with a staff strength of about 880, Joined in 2014 as a correspondent.
