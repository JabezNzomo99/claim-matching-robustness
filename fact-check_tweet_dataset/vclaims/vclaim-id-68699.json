James Lankford, R-Okla., suggested the two were being treated differently under the law at a press conference on Sept. 25, 2017.\n\n\"Now the First Amendment\u2019s the First Amendment. It goes start to finish. We can\u2019t say to one football coach, you\u2019re fired if you kneel in silent prayer at the end of the game, but to a player, if you kneel in protest at a game, you\u2019re celebrated,\" Lankford said.\n\nIs the First Amendment setting a double-standard being set when it comes to kneeling and football games? Not quite. Lankford\u2019s comparison is misleading, as the First Amendment is only applicable to one of these cases. In addition, he doesn\u2019t have all of the facts straight.\n\nLankford said high school coaches have kneeled in silent prayer and have \"been fired.\" There\u2019s one case that fits the description, though it\u2019s wrong to say the coach in question was fired.\n\nLankford was referring to Joseph Kennedy, an assistant football coach at Bremerton High School in Bremerton, Wash.\n\nKennedy led students in locker-room prayers before and after most games and prayed on the 50-yard line after games.\n\nHe also gave motivational speeches on the 50-yard line that he said \"likely constituted prayers,\" according to subsequent court documents. \"Students, coaches, and other attendees from both teams were invited to participate. During the speeches, the participants kneeled around Kennedy, who raised a helmet from each team and delivered a message containing religious content,\" according to court documents.\n\nThe school only let him pray on the 50-yard line after students and parents had left the field, which he did for awhile, but eventually returned to praying before they departed.\n\nWhen it came time for annual review, \"the athletic director recommended that Kennedy not be rehired because Kennedy \u2018failed to follow district policy\u2019 and \u2018failed to supervise student-athletes after games due to his interactions with (the) media and (the) community,\u2019\" according to court documents.\n\nAfter his contract expired, alongside the five other assistant football coaches\u2019 year-long contracts, the district opened up his position and Kennedy did not reapply.\n\nInstead, Kennedy \"sought an injunction ordering the district to \u2018cease discriminating against him in violation of the First Amendment.\u2019\"\n\nThe district court denied the injunction and the 9th Circuit panel upheld that decision. Lankford, co-chair of the Congressional Prayer Caucus, drafted a challenge to the school district in 2015 on the issue.\n\nLankford\u2019s office did not provide additional examples that fit the description of his claim.\n\nThe First Amendment protects the expression of private citizens, which the coach would have exercised if praying in the stands or the sidelines, according to Gene Policinski, chief operating officer of the Newseum\u2019s First Amendment Center.\n\nStudents (in this case comparable to the NFL players) are free to pray silently, but as public employees, coaches are only allowed to do so under circumstances in which they don\u2019t offer an overt endorsement of their religious views.\n\n\"When Kennedy kneeled and prayed on the 50-yard line immediately after games while in view of students and parents, he spoke as a public employee, not as a private citizen, and his speech therefore was constitutionally unprotected,\" the 9th Circuit wrote in its opinion denying Kennedy\u2019s injunction claim.\n\nThe court found that Kennedy \"took advantage of his position to press his particular views upon the impressionable and captive minds before him.\"\n\nWhile there may be disagreements with the court\u2019s ruling (like Lankford\u2019s), the key distinction between the coach\u2019s case and NFL players is that restriction of free speech by the First Amendment only applies to the former, as it constitutes government action. The First Amendment doesn\u2019t apply to a privately owned company like the NFL.\n\nWhen kneeling, NFL players are acting as private individuals, so they enjoy the same free speech and free exercise rights that Kennedy\u2019s players would enjoy. However, the First Amendment isn\u2019t enough to protect them against their employers because their employers aren't the government.\n\nOnly state laws, and in some cases employment contracts, can rein in the limits set by their employer, experts told us.\n\n\"It does not violate the First Amendment for a private employer (or for customers/fans) to disapprove of an employee's speech,\" said Richard Garnett, a law professor at Notre Dame University.\n\nSo while some fans may celebrate players\u2019 kneeling in protest, it\u2019s up to the NFL whether to take action.\n\nLankford said, \"Now the First Amendment\u2019s the First Amendment. It goes start to finish. We can\u2019t say to one football coach you\u2019re fired if you kneel in silent prayer at the end of the game, but to a player, if you kneel in protest to a game, you\u2019re celebrated.\"\n\nHis complaint of the First Amendment\u2019s double standard is misleading because the First Amendment only applies to government action, or the public high school football coach. The First Amendment doesn\u2019t protect NFL players\u2019 speech, which is under the purview of their employer.\n\nAdditionally, the football coach Lankford discussed wasn\u2019t fired; he failed to reapply once his contract ended.", "lang": "en"}
