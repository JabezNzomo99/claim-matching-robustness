Referencing the chart, the NPR says it \u201cillustrates the marked difference between U.S. efforts to reduce the salience of nuclear weapons and the contrary actions of others over the past decade.\u201d\n\nFive decades later, these missiles are still in place, providing safe, secure and effective strategic nuclear deterrence. Since it first deployed, a number of state-of-the-art improvements and modernization programs have helped the Minuteman system continue its deterrence mission with improved reliability that supports the missile\u2019s remarkable 99 percent alert rate. Air Force Global Strike Command continues to modernize the weapon system through a series of extensive Minuteman III Life Extension Programs. Nearly the entire missile has been refurbished, including the flight controls and propellant in all three stages, the guidance system and the Propulsion System Rocket Engine. \u201cWe are checking and balancing everything, but they are basically new missiles except for the shell,\u201d Mr. Michael Knipp, ICBM Program Analyst, said. \u201cOver the last decade we\u2019ve done more than $7 billion worth of upgrades to 450 missiles.\u201d\n\n\u201cRussia generally builds delivery systems (and warheads) that don\u2019t last as long as their U.S. counterparts,\u201d Reif said. \u201cThe U.S. military has upgraded and refurbished nearly all of its existing strategic and tactical delivery systems and the warheads they carry to last well beyond their originally planned service life. These modernized forces are more capable than the originals. And now the United States is in the early stages of replacing most of its existing systems with new systems.\u201d\n\nTom Crosson, a Pentagon spokesman, defended the chart, saying it was meant to reflect a statement made by the National Intelligence Council in 2012: \u201cNuclear ambitions in the U.S. and Russia over the last 20 years have evolved in opposite directions. Reducing the role of nuclear weapons in U.S. security strategy is a U.S. objective, while Russia is pursuing new concepts and capabilities for expanding the role of nuclear weapons in its security strategy.\u201d (The sentence is plucked from Page 72 of a discussion of terrorism in a 141-page Global Trends 2030 report that mostly focused on the impact of economic and demographic trends, including extensive examination of the impact of climate change in fostering civil conflict.)\n\nHe said that adding life-extension programs would be \u201ccomparing apples and oranges\u201d because the United States does not know the details of life-extension programs in other countries. \u201cThe same is true for future programs, including the proposed U.S. replacement program,\u201d he added. \u201cWe simply do not know the full scope and scale of the other countries\u2019 future nuclear development and deployment programs over coming decades, while we do know our own proposed replacement systems in some detail. Consequently, there could be little confidence in such a comparison.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
