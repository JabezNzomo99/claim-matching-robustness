Someone sent this on whatsapp. I tend not to fall for false/ fake news ..hence checking..is this true ? If yes what idioticity is this !! I seriously hope this is not true . Can someone pls confirm. pic.twitter.com/q9sLpyQQ6F \u2014 Tehseen Poonawalla (@tehseenp) March 19, 2018 Webqoof: No, Hawking Did Not Say Vedas Are Superior to Einstein\n\nThis news was given credence to by no less a publication than Times of India, but as it turned out, the circular was fake. VLB Janakiammal College, Coimbatore has confirmed through a Facebook post on 18 March that no such circular has been issued. It also added that a circular had been issued in January 2018 in which students were informed that henceforth, fresh juices would be served on campus in place of soft drinks. Moreover, if you look at the circular, it is dated 24 January 2018 whereas Priya Varrier\u2019s teaser for her upcoming movie became famous in February 2018. Also, a closer look at this circular reveals that the original document has been tampered with. In the space where the text has been printed, an outline of a rectangle can be seen which suggests that the original text has been replaced. Boomlive in an article had pointed this out. A Twitter user @beastoftraal too brought this to the notice of social media users. Using an obviously fake, photoshopped meme to build a story. The specific thing that's wrong (that lets enormously influential mainstream media be the carrier of fake news) is not reaching out to the college for a clarification! https://t.co/J8rqbEZBPO pic.twitter.com/03Z0VqZWPo \u2014 Karthik (@beastoftraal) March 19, 2018 This is not the first time that prominent media organisations have missed a step when it comes to reporting news. The report was published without verifying its authenticity and later retracted, when a preliminary check would have sufficed. Webqoof: Is an Istanbul Artist Missing Sridevi?
