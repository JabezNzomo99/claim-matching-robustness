His work, which ranged from vaudeville to film, often featured his iconic greasepaint mustache, spectacles and cigar.\n\nWhile Marx coined numerous maxims and witticisms, there is no evidence that the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post is one of those. The saying doesn\u2019t appear in his collected writings or his correspondence. Searching his autobiographies didn\u2019t return any results either.\n\nEtymologist Barry Popik traced the statement back to a 1930 Massachusetts newspaper where, according to his website, British publisher and writer Ernest Benn is quoted as saying the expression, though the wording varies slightly. The quote can also be found, attributed to Benn, in Henry Powell Spring\u2019s 1944 book \u201cWhat is Truth.\u201d\n\nThe earliest instance of Marx being credited with the expression occurred in a 1964 issue of the Kentucky New Era newspaper, according to Popik.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
