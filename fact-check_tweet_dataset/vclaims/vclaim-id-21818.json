But he and his staff have been trying to make clear that they didn\u2019t just win \u2014 they say they steamrolled Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"We had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the Electoral College,\" Trump told Chris Wallace on the Dec. 11 edition of Fox News Sunday.\n\nThat echoed earlier comments by the Trump transition team and a tweet by campaign manager Kellyanne Conway (\"306. Landslide. Blowout. Historic\"). We previously rated False the statement by Reince Priebus, Trump\u2019s soon-to-be White House chief of staff, that Trump\u2019s victory was \"an electoral landslide.\"\n\nSo what about Trump\u2019s own assertion that \"we had a massive landslide victory ... in the Electoral College\"? (Trump\u2019s transition office did not respond to an inquiry.)\n\nThe claim remains well short on evidence\n\nHere is a chart showing the percentage of electoral votes won by every presidential winner since George Washington (who was the only president to win every single electoral vote). It\u2019s drawn from research by John J. Pitney Jr., a Claremont McKenna College political scientist.\n\nTrump\u2019s victory is marked in red. He won 56.88 percent of the available electoral votes.\n\nThis chart makes it clear that Trump\u2019s percentage doesn\u2019t rank near the top. In fact, it ranks near the bottom, belonging somewhere between the lowest one-fourth and the lowest one-fifth of all Electoral College victories in history.\n\n\"If your share of the electoral vote ranks behind Martin Van Buren's, then you did not win in a landslide,\" Pitney told PolitiFact.\n\nIf you think that comparing elections 200-plus years ago to today is problematic, the math also shows that Trump\u2019s share of the Electoral College vote is low by recent standards.\n\nSince the end of World War II, Trump\u2019s percentage of the Electoral College vote is lower than 12 previous results (1948, 1952, 1956, 1964, 1972, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2008 and 2012). By contrast, Trump\u2019s electoral vote haul was bigger than only five elections in the post-World War II era (1960, 1968, 1976, 2000 and 2004). So Trump ranks in the bottom one-third by this metric.\n\n\"If Trump\u2019s election was a landslide, then the word \u2018landslide\u2019 has no meaning,\" said University of Denver political scientist Seth Masket.\n\nThe popular-vote discrepancy in favor of Hillary Clinton further dampens Trump\u2019s claim.\n\nAs of Dec. 12, with a dwindling number of votes remaining to be counted, Clinton is winning the popular vote by 2.84 million votes, or 2.1 percentage points.\n\nWhile there have been four previous occasions when a presidential candidate lost the Electoral College vote while winning the popular vote, Clinton\u2019s margin of victory is notably large.\n\nMeasured by raw votes, Clinton\u2019s margin is currently more than five times bigger than Al Gore\u2019s 2000 popular vote victory.\n\nLosing the popular vote \"takes the shine off any Electoral College victory,\" political scientist Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told PolitiFact Wisconsin.\n\nPitney of Claremont McKenna said he\u2019s mystified about why the Trump camp is trying to make such a weak argument in the place of ones that would hold more water.\n\n\"If they had just described the outcome as a \u2018dramatic upset victory,\u2019 nobody could reasonably disagree,\" Pitney said.\n\nTrump said, \"We had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the Electoral College.\"\n\nTrump won, but to call it a \"massive landslide\" in the Electoral College is not accurate by any reasonable definition. While Trump surpassed the required 270 electoral votes with room to spare, his margin ranks no better than the bottom quarter of Electoral College showings in American history, and no better than the bottom one-third of the showings since the end of World War II.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim is inaccurate, so we rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
