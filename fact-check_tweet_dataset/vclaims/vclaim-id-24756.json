Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Video of Kashmiri women begging the Indian Army for medicines as there no medicines due to recent siege. Fact: The video is related to an incident which happened in July-2018. In the video, the Indian Army closed the shops as there was a militant attack on CRPF jawans at Batmaloo in Srinagar. So, an old video is being shared as an incident after the government\u2019s recent decision on Article 370. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the screenshots of the video were run through Google Reverse Image Search, the original video was found in the search results. The original video was uploaded on YouTube by \u2018Gulistan News\u2019 in July 2018 with the title, \u201c#Breaking: Militant attack CRPF party at Batmaloo in Srinagar. #JammuAndKashmir\u201d. Also, newspaper articles regarding this incident can be read here and here. All these reports indicate that the video shared is most likely related to the search operations conducted by the police and CRPF, after the militants attack on a paramilitary patrol party in Srinagar\u2019s Batamaloo area on the 24 July 2018. \n\n\n\nTo sum it up, an old video is being falsely shared as Kashmiri women begging the Indian Army for medicines due to recent siege.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
