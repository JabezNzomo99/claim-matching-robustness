The DNC pointed us to an article by the Washington Examiner, which reported that it is unlikely that the Trump administration would revive the rule and may withdraw the appeal.\n\nTrump was asked about this rule in August 2016, before the judge\u2019s ruling (or even the election). In an interview with Circa News, Trump said he would roll back regulations enacted under the Obama administration and said he wanted a delay or an exemption to the rule for small-business owners:\n\n\u201cAnd there are 85 million hard-working Americans who would agree with that [rolling back regulations],\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have to address the issues of over-taxation and over-regulation and the lack of access to credit markets to get our small business owners thriving again. Rolling back the overtime regulation is just one example of the many regulations that need to be addressed to do that. We would love to see a delay or a carve-out of sorts for our small business owners.\u201d\n\nThe DNC also pointed to an October 2016 memo by the Trump campaign\u2019s Small Business Advisory Council, which listed overtime rules as one of the top issues hurting small-business owners. Regarding the overtime rule and broader labor issues, the memo read: \u201cIt seems to many Small Business Owners out here in \u2018flyover land\u2019 that the insiders in DC have it in for them. And they probably do. They tell you what you have to pay, set your work rules, mandate benefits and make it impossible to get a fair organizational vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was overtime before the Obama-era regulation went into effect. It is just this change. It was an expansion. It was ruled illegal, and President Trump would not want to do anything illegal. But to say that he wants to get rid of all overtime is absolutely ludicrous,\u201d said Diana Furchtgott-Roth, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute who served on the Trump transition team for the Labor Department.\n\nA White House spokesman said the administration supports overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act, and is still considering whether to appeal the federal judge\u2019s ruling: \u201cThe Fair Labor Standards Act provides all hourly and some salaried employees with overtime. The administration plans to faithfully enforce those requirements. However, a Federal judge ruled the Obama administration\u2019s salaried overtime regulations exceeded DOL\u2019s statutory authority; DOL is currently examining what steps to take next with regards to those enjoined regulations.\u201d\n\nPerez used slippery language to suggest that Trump wants to eliminate overtime for all workers. A DNC spokeswoman acknowledged that Perez meant to say \u201covertime rule\u201d rather than just \u201covertime.\u201d So Perez was speaking about an Obama administration regulation to expand mandatory overtime to about 4 million more workers that has been blocked after a federal judge questioned the legality of the Labor Department\u2019s authority to enact such a rule. The rule has not gone into effect.\n\nTrump said in an August 2016 interview that he wants to roll back the regulation for small-business owners, but his administration has not yet decided whether to continue the Obama administration\u2019s appeal of the judge\u2019s ruling. A White House spokesman said the administration will enforce overtime requirements as legally required.\n\nWe wavered between Two and Three Pinocchios. Perez\u2019s language created a misleading impression that Trump would eliminate overtime pay for all workers, which is quite different from the specific overtime rule \u2014 thus entering the realm of Three Pinocchios. But Perez\u2019s staff acknowledged that he misspoke on air, and we understand that happens on live television. So we will award him Two Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
