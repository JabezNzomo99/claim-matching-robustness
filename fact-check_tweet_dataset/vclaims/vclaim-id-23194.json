All but one company named said they didn\u2019t work with the company in question.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-23194", "url": "https://fullfact.org/online/HEK-293-cells/", "vclaim": "There aren\u2019t human foetal cells in lots of popular snacks and drinks\n\nA video on Facebook claims that KraftHeinz, the Coca-Cola Company, Campbell\u2019s, PepsiCo and Nestl\u00e9 use flavourings made from the cells of aborted babies.\n\nKraftHeinz, the Coca-Cola Company, Campbell\u2019s and PepsiCo all told us this was not the case. Nestl\u00e9 didn\u2019t respond to our queries.\n\nThat aside, the implication that these flavourings are \u201cmade of\u201d human cells is misleading. Though cells derived from human tissue may be involved in developing some flavourings, those cells are not in the flavouring itself.\n\nWe looked at a very similar claim (focusing solely on Pepsi) in April.\n\nWhat does the video say?\n\nThe video claims that a company called Senomyx creates flavour enhancements for companies like Pepsi, Kraft, Nestl\u00e9 and Campbell\u2019s.\n\nIt goes on to say that Senomyx grafts kidney cells from human aborted foetuses, replicates these cells, and puts them in products including Gatorade, Lay\u2019s chips, Pepsi, Tropicana (all made by PepsiCo), Dasani water and Minute Maid (both made by the Coca-Cola Company).\n\nText above the video reads \u201cHEK-239 [sic] artificial flavouring uses aborted fetus cells.\u201d\n\nHEK-293 is not a flavouring, and not directly \u201cmade from\u201d aborted foetus cells\n\nHEK-293 is the name given to a specific line of cells used in various scientific applications.\n\nIt is not in itself a flavouring, but one of its applications is to help mimic taste-receptor cells in the development of new flavourings.\n\nThe original cells were taken from the kidney of an aborted baby in 1973. HEK 293 cells used nowadays are clones of those original cells, but are not themselves the cells of aborted babies.\n\nSenomyx, a biotechnology company, has patents appearing to relate to using HEK-293 cells in developing flavourings. HEK-293 is not in the flavouring itself.\n\nSo the video is incorrect in saying that Senomyx themselves \u201cgraft kidney cells from human aborted foetuses\u201d and incorrect to say these cells are put into products.\n\nMost of these companies don\u2019t use Senomyx products\n\nWhen we asked them for comment Campbell\u2019s, KraftHeinz and the Coca-Cola Company said they did not use products made by Senomyx or any flavourings developed using HEK-293 cells in any of their products.\n\nPepsiCo confirmed to us that they do collaborate with Senomyx on research, but that none of that research uses any human tissue or cell lines derived from embryos or foetuses.\n\nNestl\u00e9 did not respond to our questions.\n\nThe text accompanying the video is more accurate\n\nThe caption accompanying the video clarifies that HEK-293 cells are not themselves found in these products. It also only names Pepsi, Nestl\u00e9 and Ajinomoto as companies who partner with Senomyx.\n\nHowever for the purpose of checking this post we have focused on the video.", "lang": "en"}
