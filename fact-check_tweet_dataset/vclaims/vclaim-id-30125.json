The photos have been shared in a misleading context; they are actually screenshots taken from a Facebook video which shows a routine flag lowering ceremony at the embassy; the Philippine foreign affairs department told AFP that people had mistaken the flag ceremony as a deliberate removal of the flag following the worker deployment ban.\n\nThe photos were posted here on Facebook on January 17, 2020. The post was shared more than 900 times.\n\nOne photo marked \u201cBefore\u201d shows the Philippine flag flying, while another photo marked \u201cAfter\u201d shows the flag lowered and being folded.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Tagalog-language caption translates to English as: \"The Philippine flag was removed from our embassy here in Kuwait. It seems the Philippines has given up because of the inhumane things done to our fellow Filipinos. (Reposted)\n\n #salute all OFW\n\n #justice served\".\n\nIn January, Manila announced a ban on the deployment of newly-hired domestic helpers to Kuwait following reported cases of maltreatment and deaths of Filipino workers there. Here is a government resolution dated January 3, 2020 on the issue.\n\nThe same photos with a similar claim about the deployment ban were shared here, here and here on Facebook.\n\nBut the photos are being shared in a misleading context; AFP traced the source of the photos to this Facebook live video, posted on January 16, 2020. It shows a flag lowering ceremony at the embassy while the Philippine national anthem plays.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Facebook live video, which is 11 minutes and 10 seconds in length:\n\nThe live video\u2019s Tagalog-language caption translates to English as: \u201cFLAG LOWERING AT OUR EMBASSY\u201d.\n\nTwice in the live video, a voiceover in Tagalog can be heard saying the flag lowering is a routine ceremony at the embassy done every Thursday.\n\nFrom the 00:40-00:46 mark, the voiceover says: \u201cThe flag lowering is happening here. This happens every Thursday at our embassy.\u201d\n\nAnd from the 03:15-03:24 mark, the voiceover says: \u201cSo there\u2019s the flag lowering because it\u2019s Thursday. Meanwhile, the flag raising happens every Sunday.\u201d\n\nIn Kuwait, weekend days are Friday and Saturday.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison showing the photos in the misleading posts (L) and keyframes of the Facebook live video (R):\n\n\n\n The Philippine foreign affairs department told AFP the flag lowering had been mistaken for a deliberate removal of the flag due to the deployment ban.\n\n\u201cAccording to Philippine Embassy Kuwait, the removal of the flag last Thurs is the flag retreat ceremony of the Post,\u201d foreign affairs assistant secretary Eduardo Menez said in a WhatsApp message on January 21.\n\n\u201cSomeone took on FB Live the flag retreat ceremony and others may have thought that it was deliberately removed because of the ban.\u201d\n\nThe Philippine flag can be seen flying again at the embassy in this Facebook live video posted on January 19.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Facebook video:", "lang": "en"}
