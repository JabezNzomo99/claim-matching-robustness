But it wasn\u2019t designed to be representative and more representative surveys found it's about 1 in 10.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-28714", "url": "https://fullfact.org/health/period-poverty-how-widespread-it/", "vclaim": "Period poverty: how widespread is it?\n\nA number of media reports last month focused on the findings of a survey on period poverty. Period poverty is the term used to describe when women and girls struggle or are unable to afford menstrual products and the impact this has on them.\n\nThe survey found around a quarter of women and girls who responded said they had experienced period poverty at some point, but it wasn\u2019t designed to be nationally representative so we can\u2019t reliably apply this figure to the wider population. Other more reliable surveys suggest the figure is nearer one in ten young women and girls across the UK.\n\nThe latest survey wasn\u2019t designed to be nationally representative\n\n27% of women and girls responding to the survey said they couldn\u2019t afford menstrual products.\n\nThe survey was conducted online by PR firm GingerComms, the Bloody Big Brunch campaign and Hey Girls, a sanitary product company. It asked questions to around 1,000 people (both men and women) across England, Scotland and Wales.\n\nThe survey also found that, of those respondents who said they\u2019d experienced period poverty, over a quarter had missed school or work as a result. This would seem to suggest that around 1 in 10 of all women and girls responding to the survey, rather than a quarter as was reported by some media, had missed school or work due to period poverty. The wording of the press release is not completely clear though, and we\u2019ve asked the team behind it for more information.\n\nThe survey can\u2019t be used to reliably make statements about the wider population of Great Britain, because GingerComms told us that the participants weren\u2019t selected to be nationally representative and the final results weren\u2019t weighted for this either.\n\nWe also don\u2019t know how the questions in the survey were worded. The wording of questions can have a big effect on answers, so without seeing the wording of this survey we don\u2019t know how reliable its findings are. We\u2019ve asked GingerComms to send us the full results of the poll, which it said it was unable to do, so we asked it for more information. It was able to answer some of our questions but not all as it didn\u2019t do the analysis on the data it collected. We\u2019ve asked Bloody Big Brunch and Hey Girls for more information too.\n\nThe results are higher than those found in other polls\n\nA survey of girls and women aged 14-21 in the UK was carried out in August 2017 by pollsters Opinium, for Plan International. It found that one in ten girls and women said they had been unable to afford sanitary wear while one in seven said they had struggled to afford it. The group of 1,000 girls and women taking part in the poll were selected to be representative of the wider population.\n\nPollsters YouGov also ran a survey for the Mayor of London\u2019s Office in February and March 2018. It found that 17% of 16-24 year-olds girls living in London said they had \u201cstruggled to afford sanitary wear\u201d or \u201cbeen unable to afford sanitary wear\u201d at some point. The question didn\u2019t specify a timeframe so this could have been at any point since their periods began. This was based on a nationally representative sample of around 700 girls and young women.", "lang": "en"}
