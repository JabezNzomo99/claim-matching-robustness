So how\u2019s that looking?\n\nMrs May is correct that spending on state schools in England is at record levels, but that in itself isn\u2019t particularly impressive\u2014government budgets are often at record levels in cash terms, just to keep up with inflation. It\u2019s also important to know how many pupils that money has to cover.\n\nIf you just look at funding per pupil and ignore inflation, it appears correct that the schools budget in the coming years has been protected. The same is true if you factor in inflation but ignore rising pupil numbers.\n\nBut real-terms funding per pupil\u2014that is, taking both factors into account\u2014is set to fall. That\u2019s the conclusion of analysis from the National Audit Office and, more recently, the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The latter projects a 6.5% reduction by 2019/20.\n\nThe full extract from the Conservative manifesto reads:\n\n\u201cUnder a future Conservative Government, the amount of money following your child into school will be protected. As the number of pupils increases, so will the amount of money in our schools. On current pupil number forecasts, there will be a real-terms increase in the schools budget in the next Parliament.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear whether this is a promise to protect spending both in real terms and per pupil.\n\nThe government did protect the real-terms schools budget per pupil in the last parliament, and the IFS notes that the projected falls \u201cfollow on from very significant growth over the 2000s\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ve been talking here about spending on pupils up to the age of 16, in primary and secondary schools in England only. The funding situation at other levels within England are different, and education is a devolved responsibility in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.", "lang": "en"}
