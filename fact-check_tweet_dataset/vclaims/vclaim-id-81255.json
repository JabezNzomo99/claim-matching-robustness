During a speech last week, he touted a number of such steps, including \u201cwaste less energy overall.\u201d\n\nAs an example, he pointed to this: \u201cThe Department of Energy is putting a new efficiency standard \u2014 set of efficiency standards in place that could save businesses billions of dollars in energy costs and cut carbon pollution.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how the administration\u2019s fact sheet for the speech explained it: \u201cToday, DOE is issuing two final energy efficiency conservation standards. One standard for electric motors, which are frequently used to power devices such as conveyor belts and escalators, another standard for walk-in coolers and freezers, such as those used to display milk in supermarkets.\u201d\n\nThe DOE\u2019s explanation of regulations makes it clear that they were set in motion because of a law passed in 2007 \u2014 the Energy Independence and Security Act. The law passed with overwhelming support in the Congress and was signed into law by President George W. Bush on Dec. 19, 2007.\n\nThe first notice of a public hearing for the walk-in cooler and freezers was on Jan. 9, 2009, in the waning days of the Bush administration. The first notice of a public hearing on the electric motors regulation was on Sept. 28, 2010, almost two years into the Obama administration.\n\nWhile Obama now touts the savings that will result from implementing the regulations, advocates for the rules have been counting the cost of the delays. As of August, according to the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, the delays on the cooler regulation had cost consumers and businesses $1.5 billion in 2011 dollars. (We have not checked the source of this figure, but offer it to demonstrate the frustration of energy-efficiency activists.)\n\nIndeed, it required a push by a coalition of 10 states and the city of New York before the Department of Energy committed to a timetable to finally complete these regulations by the Spring of 2014.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama has pledged to use the power of his pen and his phone to expand opportunity for all Americans, whether Congress passes new legislation or not. That\u2019s exactly what he did last week when he announced commitments from more than 300 public and private sector partners along with executive actions to cut carbon pollution and create jobs by advancing solar power and energy efficiency. Since taking office in 2009, the Obama Administration has made energy efficiency a key priority, issuing the toughest fuel economy standards in history along with energy efficiency standards for more than 30 products that will save American consumers nearly $450 billion on their utility bills through 2030.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s remarks might have left listeners with the impression that the Department of Energy is acting quickly to impose new efficiency rules, without waiting for Congress. But the reality is that these elements of the \u201cYear of Action\u201d came after years of inaction, at the behest of the White House. In this case, Congress mandated the rules \u2014 and the White House created the gridlock.", "lang": "en"}
