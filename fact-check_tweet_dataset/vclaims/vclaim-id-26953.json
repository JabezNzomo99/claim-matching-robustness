Andrew Cuomo on Jan. 22, the anniversary of the landmark Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that guaranteed a woman\u2019s right to an abortion. It\u2019s a measure that abortion-rights advocates in New York have long sought to pass but couldn\u2019t previously get through a Republican-controlled state Senate. Democrats now control both chambers of the Legislature.\n\nThe new law codifies a woman\u2019s right to access abortion in New York \u2014 and has also prompted speculation and claims.\n\nReaders have sent us a number of questions, including: \u201cIs it true that the NY state abortion law allows an aborted infant who is born alive to be killed?\u201d and \u201cWhat are the facts about the new abortion laws in New York state?\u201d\n\nWe address those and more here.\n\nWhat the law says\n\nThe RHA permits abortions when \u2014 according to a medical professional\u2019s \u201creasonable and good faith professional judgment based on the facts of the patient\u2019s case\u201d \u2014 \u201cthe patient is within twenty-four weeks from the commencement of pregnancy, or there is an absence of fetal viability, or the abortion is necessary to protect the patient\u2019s life or health.\u201d\n\nIn other words, women may choose to have an abortion prior to 24 weeks; pregnancies typically range from 38 to 42 weeks. After 24 weeks, such decisions must be made with a determination that there is an \u201cabsence of fetal viability\u201d or that the procedure is \u201cnecessary to protect the patient\u2019s life or health.\u201d That determination must be made by a \u201chealth care practitioner licensed, certified, or authorized\u201d under state law, \u201cacting within his or her lawful scope of practice.\u201d\n\nPreviously, abortions after 24 weeks were justified only in cases where the mother\u2019s life was at risk \u2014 which was inconsistent with a part of the Roe decision, as we explain later.\n\nUnder the old law, New York criminalized abortion unless it was a \u201cjustifiable abortional act\u201d \u2014 meaning it was within 24 weeks of the commencement of pregnancy or necessary to \u201cpreserve\u201d the mother\u2019s life.\n\nThe RHA removes abortion from the state\u2019s penal code altogether; the homicide statute still defines a \u201cperson\u201d as \u201ca human being who has been born and is alive.\u201d Killing a baby once born was and is still considered a homicide.\n\nProponents of the bill argued that abortion should be treated as a health care matter, not as a criminal one. Some pointed to examples of women being forced to travel out of state to terminate pregnancies with fetuses that doctors said would not survive outside the womb. Opponents, on the other hand, said the change removes an important prosecutorial power \u2014 such as being able to fully charge a domestic abuser for ending a woman\u2019s pregnancy.\n\nRoe v. Wade held that states may limit abortions after fetal viability, except in cases \u201cnecessary to preserve the life or health of the mother\u201d (New York\u2019s old law, which predated the decision, only allowed for late-term exceptions to protect the mother\u2019s life.) Fetal viability was defined as being the point when a fetus was \u201cpotentially able to live outside the mother\u2019s womb, albeit with artificial aid.\u201d\n\nNew York\u2019s new law does not explicitly define \u201chealth.\u201d\n\nIn what is considered a companion case, Doe v. Bolton, the U.S. Supreme Court held that \u201cmedical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors \u2014 physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman\u2019s age \u2014 relevant to the wellbeing of the patient. All these factors may relate to health. This allows the attending physician the room he needs to make his best medical judgment.\u201d\n\n\u201cLate-term\u201d abortions are defined in different ways; some states ban abortions after 20 weeks. National data indicate such abortions are relatively rare.\n\nAccording to a 2018 report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based on 2015 data, the majority of abortions in the country \u2014 65 percent \u2014 were performed within the first eight weeks of pregnancy. Only about 1 percent were done after 21 weeks.\n\nThose national statistics incorporate data provided by New York City, which accounted for about two-thirds of abortions reported by New York state in 2015, but do not include abortions outside of the city. In New York City, 2.3 percent of abortions were performed after 21 weeks.\n\n\n\nThe CDC also noted that, between 2006 and 2015, less than 9 percent of abortions were performed after 13 weeks.\n\nAs of Jan. 1, 43 states prohibited \u201csome abortions after a certain point in pregnancy,\u201d according to the Guttmacher Institute, which conducts research on sexual and reproductive health and rights.\n\nNew York\u2019s RHA also repealed a section of the public health law that required the following: that abortions after 12 weeks be performed in a hospital; that an additional physician be present for abortions after 20 weeks to care for \u201cany live birth that is the result of the abortion\u201d; and that such babies be provided \u201cimmediate legal protection under the laws of the state of New York.\u201d\n\nThere appears to be very little in the way of statistics about such scenarios.\n\nA spokesperson for the Guttmacher Institute, for example, told us she was not aware of any data on the topic \u201cbecause if it happens, it would be extremely rare.\u201d\n\nAsked about the rationale for removing the section from the law, Justin Flagg, a spokesman for New York State Sen. Liz Krueger, who sponsored the new law, said that \u201cthe requirement that a second physician be present \u2026 did not reflect medical realities of abortion later in pregnancy nor modern standards of medical care, and was legally redundant and unnecessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cModern abortion techniques do not result in live birth; however, in the great unlikelihood that a baby was born alive, the medical provider and team of medical support staff would provide all necessary medical care, as they would in the case of any live birth,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cThe RHA does not change standard medical practices. To reiterate, any baby born alive in New York State would be treated like any other live birth, and given appropriate medical care. This was the case before the RHA, and it remains the case now.\u201d\n\nNew York defines a live birth as \u201cthe complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy, which, after such separation, breathes or shows any other evidence of life such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached; each product of such a birth is considered live born.\u201d\n\nThe abortion debate continues to be waged on a number of fronts, including in state legislatures. In Virginia, for example, Democrats have moved to ease the requirements for late-term abortions by reducing the number of doctors required to certify such an abortion, from three to one.\n\nUpdate, Feb. 11: We clarified that the CDC\u2019s national statistics cited include data provided by New York City, where two-thirds of abortions reported by the state occurred, but not the rest of the state. We also added the percentage of New York City\u2019s abortions that were performed after 21 weeks.\n\nUpdate, May 23: Citing the Guttmacher Institute, our original story said that for the purposes of abortion law, New York measures pregnancy from fertilization, while the CDC statistics include the two weeks before. However, we\u2019ve removed that sentence to account for the ambiguity of New York\u2019s law, which does not explicitly define \u201ccommencement of pregnancy.\u201d A spokeswoman for the New York Health Department told us: \u201cAs is common practice for health related statutes, the term \u2018commencement of pregnancy,\u2019 is intended to be based on practitioners\u2019 reasonable and good faith professional judgment, in consultation with their patients.\u201d Flagg, Krueger\u2019s spokesman, said it was his \u201cunderstanding that typical practice among providers is to date it beginning two weeks after the last [menstrual] period\u201d \u2013 in other words, from fertilization.\n\n\u201cAbortion Surveillance \u2014 United States, 2015.\u201d Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.
