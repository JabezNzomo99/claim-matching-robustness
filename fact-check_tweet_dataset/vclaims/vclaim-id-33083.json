The crowd in the video is standing on both the sides of the road while the police is shooting. The crowd looks organised and doesn\u2019t move. In the case of a real shooting incident, there is ought to be chaos.\n\n2. Secondly, when the police fires at the protesters, smoke doesn\u2019t come out of their guns but from somewhere else. (Around 00:05 seconds)\n\n3. Third, as soon as the protesters are shot down, the rest of the protesting crowd disperses and the police takes a casual stance. In a real situation, the police might run behind the protesters or try to catch them.\n\n4. Right from the beginning, you can hear people giggling and talking.", "lang": "en"}
