The restriction on public transportation has forced them to walk. Many have died on the way. On May 11, Financial Express reported that Indian Railways started special Shramik trains for migrant workers, tourists, pilgrims and students.\n\nA one-minute video of a mother and an infant travelling in a train has subsequently gone viral on WhatsApp. The mother is sitting on the lever of a moving train that connects two carriages. She has her child in her arms. Several people have requested Alt News to fact-check the viral video, on WhatsApp (+917600011160) and on our official Android application.\n\nA Facebook user also posted the viral video and questioned, \u201cWhat is the condition of our country?\u201d. It was shared over 600 times.\n\nAlt News performed a keyword search and found that the viral video was uploaded by a YouTube user in 2016.\n\nAs per the video title and description, the video is from Bangladesh.\n\nUsing this as a clue, we looked for an image of Bangladesh Railways on Reuters and performed a visual comparison with a screenshot from the viral video. We found out that both the carriages have two off-white parallel lines \u2014 highlighted in red in the image below.\n\nPrior to our fact-check, Boomlive had published a report and found that the viral video was uploaded by Bangladeshi newspaper Prothom Alo\u2019s YouTube channel on September 13, 2016. The Bangla caption of the video reads, \u201cEid means returning home physically or mentally (translated from \u0988\u09a6 \u09ae\u09be\u09a8\u09c7 \u09ac\u09be\u09a1\u09bc\u09bf \u09ab\u09c7\u09b0\u09be\u2014\u09b8\u09b6\u09b0\u09c0\u09b0\u09c7 \u09ac\u09be \u09ae\u09a8\u09c7 \u09ae\u09a8\u09c7).\u201d\n\nVideo has been shared in the past with different claims\n\nIn 2017, a YouTube user uploaded this on the occasion of mother\u2019s day video, lauding the woman for travelling without a ticket.\n\nIn 2018, UK-based newspaper Daily Mail (archive link) posted an article along with the viral video claiming it is from India.", "lang": "en"}
