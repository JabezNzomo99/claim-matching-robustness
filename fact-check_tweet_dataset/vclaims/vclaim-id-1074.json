She said the image shows, \u201cmembers of the Minnesota National Guard after/during a longer than 24-hour shift in Minneapolis during the state activation due to civil unrest (May 30).\u201d The soldiers in the photograph \u201cgrabbed a quick nap\u201d in front of U.S. Bank E 2800 Lake St. in Minneapolis. Regular 12-hour shifts were later instituted after replacement soldiers became available to relieve them, the spokeswoman added.\n\nThe area shown in the photograph where the members are sleeping can be seen at the above Minneapolis address on Google Street View ( here!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s26Bm8OAA6R97VcHxzPELNw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192 ).\n\nThe spokeswoman said the soldiers \u201chad plentiful sleeping arrangements within [their] staging areas with cots and food supplies. We were not dependent on hotel lodging.\u201d\n\nLike cities countrywide, the U.S. capital has been rocked by a week of protests against police brutality and racism following the death of George Floyd, a black Minneapolis man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck.

( here )\n\nMayor Bowser responded to the tweet: \u201cSenator \u2014 until they are recalled home \u2014 which I have formally requested from the President, your troops are in DC hotels. However, DC residents cannot pay their hotel bills. The Army can clear that up with the hotel today, and we are willing to help.\u201d ( here )\n\nAbout 200 Utah National Guard Soldiers returned home on June 7 ( here ).\n\nFalse.
