No, that's not true: the story about the man who thought he could fool police helicopter patrols into leaving him alone by first putting up plastic weed plants and then replacing them with real ones after the police had raided his place is totally made up. It originated as a joke on a Spanish satire website and was translated (badly) for the English version of the site later.\n\nThe English version of teh story appeared in an article published on December 10, 2018 titled \"Man puts on his terrace 70 fake plants of weed to taunt the police\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe event took place in Salem, when a resident, who is known for devote his time to work without having a profession, had come up with a plan: To buy seventy plastic marijuana plants and put in a visible place in his own porch. He thought: a police helicopter would figure it out and collects evidence to get a warrant and inspect the apartment. Once this step is carried out, he would change plastic plants for real ones, unnoticed. It all happened just like he planned: plastic, helicopter, warrant, break-in and also taunt which police were obliged to face, \"What's wrong? Can't I collect plastic plants?\" Thereafter, he followed through with his plan; he changed the false plants for the true ones, while he greeted police flying over the area.\n\nHere is the original Spanish version, which was set in C\u00e1diz instead of Salem and which was originally published in March 2018:\n\nThe site There Is News carries a \"Legal Warging\" (archived here) that reads:\n\nThe site \"There is news\" (http://thereisnews.es) (hereinafter referred to as TIN) is a humor site whose purpose is entertainment.
