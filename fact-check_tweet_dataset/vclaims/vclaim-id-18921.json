No, that's not true: News reports claiming \"stunning results\" in animal testing that promises to halt the death of brain cells with \"a single pill each day\" is sensational hype that overpromises, according to the Michael J. Fox Foundation -- which helped fund the research.\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nThe hyped reporting suggested to readers that the miracle pill could be on the market \"rather quickly\":\n\nA day after this report was first published, the Michael J Fox Foundation published a disclaimer and warning to Parkinson's sufferers and their families who may have developed a false hope from the article. Written by a doctor who worked for the charity, it was titled \"A Pill to Stop Parkinson's?\":\n\nA news story is circulating about a pill to stop Parkinson's. For the millions of people looking forward to a therapy that could slow or stop disease -- something we don't yet have -- articles like this offer hope, but often (as in this case) they also overpromise.\n\nThe foundation warned that even if the therapy proves to be safe and effective in human testing, it would be \"many years\" before it could be given to patients:\n\nThe results do look promising, but the author hypes the science with a sensational title and broad conclusions. Because this is pre-clinical data, the therapy needs to go through several steps (and many years) of testing before it may be ready and valid for human use. (Unfortunately, clinical trials are the steps at which many therapies fail.) The Michael J. Fox Foundation is enthusiastic about new targets and positive results. But it's disappointing when the media plays on patients' and families' hopes.\n\nThe group concluded with good advice to those waiting and watching for cures for diseases. Be wary of what you read online:\n\nNews bombards us constantly and, especially when you're waiting (understandably) impatiently for the latest breakthrough, it can be hard to differentiate information from misinformation. But anyone can be a smart consumer of research news. Don't believe everything you read (or hear) and look to unbiased sources, such as our website, to help you put news in context.\n\nLead Stories has found dozens of variations on this over-hyped health reporting.", "lang": "en"}
