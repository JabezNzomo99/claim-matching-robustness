Let\u2019s check the authenticity of these claims.\n\nClaim: Muslim Taxi Driver in Meerut murdered 250 Non-Muslims in last four months. Fact: The incident being reported is actually from 2007 and did not take place recently. There is no conclusive information on the motive of the murders or the identity of the victims. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched for \u2018Meerut 250 murders\u2019 in Google, you get few results and the latest one is published by \u2018Hindu Existence\u2019 website on 2nd June, 2019. You can also notice a article by News18 published on 30th March, 2007 and the content for the article published by Hindu Existence is copied from the News18 article by twisting it and giving it a religious angle.\n\nIt is also claimed in both Hindu Existence and News18 article that one person has murdered these 250 person in a span on 4 months, but a Times of India article claims that a gang of 35 members are suspected to have murdered 250 persons.\n\nFinally, the incident of a driver murdering about 250 members is from 2007 and did not take place recently.\n\nUpdate: To know more about the issue, FACTLY contacted Mr Dipesh Juneja\u2019s office, who was Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Meerut in 2007, (who was quoted in the news article) and spoke to them over the telephone. His office clarified that the murders were done by a gang back in 2007 and there was no religious angle to the case. They have also asked to curb the spread of this fake news. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our Facebook live on Fake News (Misinformation)", "lang": "en"}
