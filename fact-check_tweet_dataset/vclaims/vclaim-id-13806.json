Hindus are extinct in Kashmir & becoming minority in Kerala, Assam, etc. Still bigots like Raj Nayak are spreading a myth that Mughal invaders failed to harm Hindus in 1000 years and India will never become an Islamic country.\u201c\n\nThe alleged statement was posted on Twitter by a user Prashant Swami (@Prashant_Swami).\n\nThe quote was purportedly Tandon\u2019s response to a statement made by Raj Nayak, former COO of Viacom18, who had said, \u201cThe Mughal Emperors ruled the Indian Sub Continent for 300 years, we did not become a Muslim Nation. The Britishers ruled India for 200 years, we did not become a Christian Nation. So why are people going around scaring people that our religion is under threat? From whom?\u201d\n\nA lack of media reports carrying the statement allegedly made by Raveena Tandon hinted that the quote was false. Alt News reached out to the actor for comments.\n\n\u201cThis is absolutely false,\u201d Tandon confirmed. \u201cAnd has happened to me twice before. Just yesterday, I came across another quote and a tweet attributed to me. I don\u2019t know how one can put a stop to this because it completely leads to misinformation, misinterpretation and character assassination,\u201d she added.\n\nThe circulation of misinformation in the name of Bollywood actors is commonplace on social media. Fake statements accredited to them, propagating a false narrative, is more often than not believed to be true. Earlier, Amitabh Bachchan, Prakash Raj and Shah Rukh Khan had found themselves in the crosshairs of similar disinformation.", "lang": "en"}
