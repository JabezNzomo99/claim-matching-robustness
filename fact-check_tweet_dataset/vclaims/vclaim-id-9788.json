Of course not: the whole story is a work of fiction that originated on a satire website.\n\nIt first appeared on March 27, 2018 on a website named World News Daily Report where it was titled \"New Zealand: Emu farmer arrested for running illegal animal brothel\" (archived here) and opened:\n\nLongbush | New Zealand police have raided a family-operated emu farm in Carterton District suspected of operating as an illegal animal brothel. Michael Wilson, 63, and his two sons Phillip, 38, and Andrew, 34, have been arrested and accused of illegally operating an animal brothel. Twenty-six people were also arrested during the raid for their suspected involvement in sexually related activities with animals on the farm.\n\nThe man in the image used in the header of the story is not from Longbush and his name is not Michael Wilson. He is Stephen Schmidt from Coleyville (who does happen to be an actual emu farmer):\n\nThe police picture is from a drug raid in Canterbury, New Zealand:\n\nAnd the supposed family lawyer mentioned in the story, an \"Andrew Goldmann\" is really a Las Vegas based lawyer named Alex Ghibaudo:\n\nPeople who didn't know better might have suspected the story was a real news article if they saw it in isolation on social media:\n\nWe frequently write about worldnewsdailyreport.com and their hoaxes, here is just the latest crop:\n\u2022 Fake News: Cops Did NOT Beat Up Teen After Bank Teller Mistakes His Erection For A Pistol\n\u2022 Fake News: 101-Year-Old Woman Did NOT Give Birth To Her 17th Baby in Italy\n\u2022 Fake News: Teenager Did NOT Accidentally Chop Off His Genitals During Sex With A Blender\n\u2022 Fake News: Hawaii: Scuba Diver NOT Hospitalized After His Penis Gets Stuck In Giant Clam\n\u2022 Fake News: Pregnant Teen NOT Seeking 13 Paternity Tests After Gangbang With Football Team\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories.
