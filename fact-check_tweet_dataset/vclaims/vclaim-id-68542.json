Among the updates from friends and hot takes from pundits, there are often grim, fear-mongering warnings that are just, well, wrong.\n\n\"There\u2019s news from the police,\" reads one such Facebook post from Jan. 9. \"Its (sic) an urgent message for all. For the next few weeks please do not drink any product from PEPSI like Pepsi, Tropicana juice, Slice, 7up etc. A worker from the company has admitted that he added his blood contaminated with AIDS. Watch MDTV. It was on yesterday on Sky News. Please forward and warn others too.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\n\"This is false,\" PepsiCo said in an email after PolitiFact wrote seeking more information about the claim.\n\nSky News did not respond to an email asking if the network had aired a segment, like the Facebook post claims, but we couldn\u2019t find any evidence of such a story on its website. In fact, we couldn\u2019t find any credible articles about this so-called \"urgent message.\"\n\nBut for what it\u2019s worth: You can\u2019t get HIV from consuming food handled by someone with HIV, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"Even if the food contained small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen, exposure to the air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid would destroy the virus.\"\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
