Dianne Feinstein, would have applied to a much larger group than the no-fly list. As we reported in December, Feinstein\u2019s office told us the measure, which would have allowed the attorney general to block gun sales to individuals on these lists, would have included a few terrorist databases, and the no-fly list is a subset of one of them.\n\nThe largest of the databases is the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE, which included 1.1 million people as of December 2013. The second is the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Database, which is referred to simply as the Terrorist Watchlist, and contained about 800,000 names, Christopher M. Piehota, the Terrorist Screening Center director, said in congressional testimony on Sept. 18, 2014. The no-fly list is a part of that database. It contains about 64,000 names, according to Piehota\u2019s testimony.\n\nSo, while Clinton said the measure applied to suspected terrorists on the no-fly list, that\u2019s only 64,000 names. It actually would have applied to well over 1 million people who are on government watch lists. Republicans defeated the amendment in early December.\n\nRepublicans also put forth an alternative aimed at protecting those who wrongly find themselves on these terrorist watch lists \u2014 it would have delayed a gun sale and required a court ruling to actually block the sale \u2014 and it also included measures to defund cities that don\u2019t help enforce federal immigration law. That measure also failed. Both were amendments to a Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFeinstein\u2019s proposal was introduced as separate legislation in February 2015, and in the House by Republican Rep. Peter King. Both versions were referred to committee, and no action has been taken since.\n\nThe Feinstein amendment wouldn\u2019t have blocked everyone on the watch lists automatically, and Clinton made that clear in a separate June 13 interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show (6:14 mark), saying, the measure \u201callows the attorney general and FBI to prevent a suspected terrorist from [buying guns]. It would happen on a case by case basis.\u201d\n\nThe measure would have allowed the attorney general to use the databases we described to deny gun sales to a suspected or known terrorist, if there is \u201ca reasonable belief that the applicant may use a firearm in connection with terrorism,\u201d according to the legislation.\n\nIn a speech in Cleveland on June 13, Clinton again talked about gun control measures that could be implemented, saying, \u201cwe should all be able to agree on a few essential things.\u201d Among them: \u201cIf the FBI is watching you for a suspected terrorist link, you shouldn\u2019t be able to just go buy a gun with no questions asked.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019d note that in the Orlando case, however, the shooter, Omar Mateen, bought his guns after he was no longer on a terrorist watch list. FBI Director James B. Comey has said that Mateen was on the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Watchlist in 2013 and 2014 when the FBI was investigating him, first due to co-workers raising concerns about Mateen\u2019s incendiary language about terrorism and then due to him having \u201ccasually\u201d known a suicide bomber who attended the same mosque in Florida. The FBI didn\u2019t find evidence to arrest Mateen, Comey told reporters, and the investigations were closed, which removes suspects from the watch list, the New York Times reported.\n\nMateen purchased the guns used in the Orlando shooting in June.\n\nBut the Department of Justice is considering implementing some system that would alert counterterrorism officials if someone who had previously been on a watch list tries to buy a gun, the Times said.\n\nIn her Cleveland speech, Clinton also mentioned the no-fly list: \u201cAnd yes, if you\u2019re too dangerous to get on a plane, you are too dangerous to buy a gun in America.\u201d\n\nNew legislation could be proposed to more narrowly focus on the no-fly list, but, again, the Democratic measure that was defeated last year would have applied to a much larger number of individuals.", "lang": "en"}
