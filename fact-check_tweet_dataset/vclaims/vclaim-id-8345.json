This is not true. According to several viral articles about it the plan protects certain illegal aliens that were brought into the country by their parents as children from deportation and grants them work permits if they meet certain criteria:\n\nThese are not the conditions of any Trump plan. These are the guidelines listed in the existing DACA policy, which you can check here. The article actually originated on a satire website named The Potatriot Post that tried to pass off the guidelines and protections in the current DACA policy as if they were part of a new Trump immigration plan in the hope of getting gullible conservatives to agree with it. The story ends like this:\n\nDACA, or \"Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\", is a U.S. immigration policy adopted first by the Obama administration to grant certain individuals who entered the United States illegally as minors a deferment from deportation and eligibility for a work permit. The current Trump administration has sought to put an end to the policy.\n\nThe original satirical article was titled \"BREAKING: Trump Reveals Plan To Fix DACA, It's So Genius Liberals Are Losing Their Minds\" and was published here (archived version) and it was quickly stolen (archive) by fake news website USA Mirror News.\n\nThe site Potatriot Post comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites such as ladiesofliberty.net, shareotonin.com and dailyworldupdate.com. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". He has at least one accomplice who writes under the pen names \"Freedom\", \"Captain Jellypants\", \"Butch Mannington\" or \"Captain Buck Atlantis\".\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.", "lang": "en"}
