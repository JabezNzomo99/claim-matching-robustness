Feeling achy? If so, it makes sense that you\u2019d want to take ibuprofen, the over-the-counter anti-inflammatory often recommended for those symptoms.\n\nBut recent claims on social media warn that this everyday remedy could increase the risk of complications with a COVID-19 infection.\n\nKnowing the facts has never been more important. Please consider donating to PolitiFact today.\n\nIs there any truth here?\n\nWe have a two-part answer. Medical experts say the claim has no scientific backing. But they also acknowledge that more research needs to be done, especially with respect to patients with certain conditions such as hypertension and diabetes. Public health experts in England, at least, said the question is significant enough that its National Health Service recommended some patients exercise caution.\n\nRELATED: We answered your questions on coronavirus seasonality, immunity and transmission\n\nA Facebook post claims it\u2019s dangerous to take ibuprofen if you have COVID-19 and suggests the virus \"thrives\" on the medicine.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThis information is based on some genuine medical advice, but it distorts facts and makes unfounded assertions.\n\nFirst, we could find no credible evidence that states that the \"vast majority\" of the thousands who have died with COVID-19 so far all had ibuprofen in their systems. Nor have we seen any medical experts suggest that the medicine played a role in any of these COVID-19 related deaths.\n\nRumors about ibuprofen and COVID-19 largely took off after France\u2019s Health Minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, tweeted that \"taking anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, cortisone \u2026) could be a factor in worsening the infection. If you have a fever, take paracetamol.\" Paracetamol is the generic name used in Europe for acetaminophen, also known as Tylenol.\n\nSome European doctors and scientists agreed with him and have recommended people take a drug like Tylenol instead of ibuprofen or Advil as scientists study the matter. But other medical experts say there\u2019s no scientific evidence that links anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen with worsening COVID-19 infections.\n\nTo cut through the confusion, we\u2019ve compiled responses from health experts to give you the best idea on what the medical community knows, and recommends, regarding ibuprofen and COVID-19.\n\nA statement from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases says evidence is scarce and there needs to be more research:\n\nThe World Health Organization told PolitiFact it is aware of concerns on the use of non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of fever for people with COVID-19 but \"after a rapid review of the literature, WHO is not aware of published clinical or population-based data on this topic.\"\n\nHere\u2019s why there is some concern: Some medical professionals believe that the medicine\u2019s anti-inflammatory properties could dampen the body\u2019s immune response.\n\nA March 11 letter in The Lancet medical journal discussed the risk of COVID-19 in patients with hypertension and diabetes. It states that the virus binds to so-called ACE2 receptors on the surfaces of cells and that some anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen helps stimulate those cells. So, the letter theorizes that these medications may, in turn, worsen COVID-19.\n\nBut medical experts say this is just theory.\n\nSome anecdotal stories about experiences with the drug and COVID-19 have also received attention. Health experts say there isn\u2019t enough research to make a sole determination.\n\nSome medical organizations recommend using caution and suggest refraining from use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen until more studies are done.\n\nWhile acknowledging there\u2019s no evidence ibuprofen can make coronavirus worse, England's National Health Service is one of the organizations that is recommending people err on the side of caution.\n\n\"Until we have more info, take paracetamol to treat the symptoms of coronavirus, unless your doctor has told you paracetamol is not suitable for you,\" NHS wrote in a tweet on March 18.\n\nWith the current coronavirus being so new, there is not enough credible information to say for sure whether ibuprofen can negatively impact patients with coronavirus. Right now, people should remain skeptical about sweeping statements that make bold claims about the medicine and the virus.", "lang": "en"}
