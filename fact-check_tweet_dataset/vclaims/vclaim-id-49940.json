Biden Jr. has focused his low-profile campaign on hammering President Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus epidemic. We rounded up some inaccurate claims in his recent remarks. Mr. Biden misleadingly suggested he had recommended specific interventions that would have saved tens of thousands of lives. \u201cThere\u2019s a study out of Columbia University and a disease control center up there. They pointed out that if he had listened to me and others and acted just one week earlier to deal with this virus, there\u2019d be 36,000 fewer people dead.\u201d\n\n\u2014 in an interview in May on the radio program \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d This is misleading. A study by infectious disease modelers at Columbia University did find that about 36,000 deaths could have been prevented through early May had social distancing measures been enacted by March 8, rather than in mid-March. But there is no record of Mr. Biden urging adoption of those measures before March 8, nor does Mr. Trump have the power to compel their nationwide enforcement. The study estimated the combined effects of all intervention practices including mask wearing, travel restrictions, business and school closings and shelter-in-place orders as \u201cthey were varyingly applied and complied with over time on a county-by-county basis,\u201d said Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University and a co-author of the study.\n\nThis is misleading. Mr. Biden was referring to the Paycheck Protection Program, which offers forgivable loans to cover payroll costs. Data through June 20 showed that the relief program had approved more than 4.6 million loans totaling $514.9 billion. Of those, loans of over $1 million represented 35.1 percent of the funding and 1.7 percent of the number of loans. But loan size does not directly correlate to business size. While the term \u201csmall business\u201d may conjure up images of a locally run mom-and-pop shop, the government generally defines the term as companies with fewer than 500 employees, though that can vary across industries by average annual receipts and number of employees. Companies that meet the definition, as well as some nonprofits and some larger food and accommodation businesses, are all eligible for the Paycheck Protection Program. Because of this expansive eligibility criteria, some high-priced law firms, lobbying firms, private schools, luxury hotels and restaurant chains qualified for and took out millions of dollars in loans. But of the tens of thousands of companies that received over $1 million in loans, many were likely to adhere to the colloquial understanding of a \u201csmall business\u201d like a local craft brewery in Philadelphia, an artisanal cowboy boot company in El Paso, an independent bookstore in San Francisco and a family-owned third-generation florist in Boston. Survey data also undercuts the suggestion that small businesses had been crowded out by large ones: about three-quarters of small businesses had requested assistance from the lending program and about 72.4 percent had received funding through June 27. Moreover, when the program first expired and before it was extended on June 30, it had more than $130 billion still in its coffers. \u201cWithout a uniform plan and guidance from the federal government that state and local leaders can use to inform their reopening plans, this is going to continue to be worse than it would\u2019ve been otherwise.\u201d\n\n\u2014 in remarks in July\n\nMr. Biden was imprecisely referring to the largely high marks he received from the N.A.A.C.P. in its voter information guides throughout his career, ranging from 60 percent in 1995 to 1996 to 100 percent in three congressional terms. Mr. Biden later acknowledged that his claim was a \u201cmistake\u201d and said that he had \u201coverwhelming support from the African-American community my whole career.\u201d Based on scattered polling data throughout Mr. Biden\u2019s long electoral history, his claim of \u201coverwhelming support\u201d from Black voters is generally true. The Wilmington News Journal reported that Mr. Biden won 65 percent of Black voters in 1972, his first Senate race. Polling in March 1984, before his re-election bid, also showed him leading his opponent among Black voters. More than 80 percent of Black voters backed Mr. Biden in 1990 and 1996, and more than 97 percent in his last Senate race in 2008, according to exit polling data provided by the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research. Black primary voters in South Carolina powered him to a crucial victory this year en route to securing the presidential nomination. \u201cI\u2019ve been against Keystone from the beginning.\u201d\n\n\u2014 in a May interview on CNBC This is exaggerated. Whether Mr. Biden privately opposed the Keystone XL pipeline project \u201cfrom the beginning,\u201d he rarely spoke about it publicly as vice president and did not really stake out a position. The pipeline, which would carry crude oil from Canada to Nebraska, was first proposed in the summer of 2008 and attracted fierce opposition from environmental groups and others during the Obama administration. A first proposal for the pipeline was rejected by President Barack Obama in January 2012, reasoning that a deadline set by Congress did not leave his administration time to do a thorough environmental assessment. Mr. Obama said that the decision was \u201cnot a judgment on the merits of the pipeline,\u201d and left the door open for a revised application. Mr. Biden, responding to a question about Keystone on Twitter that month, said a permit could \u201cpossibly\u201d be revisited, but it would \u201cneed thorough study.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
