Now, I did do a [financial disclosure] filing of over a hundred pages, I believe, which is in the offices. And when people went and saw that filing and they saw the magnitude of it, they were very disappointed. And they saw the \u2014 you know, the detail. You get far more from that. And I guess we filed that, now, three times. But you get far more from that than you could ever get from a tax return.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s false. A tax return provides a lot of information that is not contained in the disclosure form, including: what, if anything, Trump paid in taxes, what kinds of tax deductions and other tax breaks he took, whether he has offshore accounts, and whether he gave to charity. The president\u2019s effective tax rate would be learned and could be easily compared to that of ordinary Americans. Financial disclosure forms require only that assets be reported with broad ranges; a tax return would have the value to the dollar.\n\nIn fact, Nixon made the comment while defending his tax deductions. He said he welcomed the scrutiny: \u201cI have never profited, never profited from public service \u2014 I have earned every cent. And in all of my years of public life, I have never obstructed justice,\u201d Nixon told reporters in 1973. \u201cI welcome this kind of examination, because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook. Well, I am not a crook. I have earned everything I have got.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look at the employment and unemployment numbers for African Americans, for Asian Americans, for Hispanic Americans, they\u2019re at a historic high. A poll came out recently where my numbers with Hispanics and with African Americans are the highest \u2014 the best they\u2019ve ever been. That had \u2014 that took place two or three days ago, the poll. They\u2019re \u2014 I have the best numbers with African American and Hispanic American that I\u2019ve ever had before.\u201d\n\nOne can argue whether that response was appropriate, but Obama argued at the time that Ukraine was a core Russian interest but not an American one, so a military confrontation was out of the question. \u201cThe fact is that Ukraine, which is a non-NATO country, is going to be vulnerable to military domination by Russia no matter what we do,\u201d Obama told The Atlantic. He noted that Russia also invaded Georgia under George W. Bush\u2019s watch.\n\nThe document signed by Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was remarkably vague, leaving it open to interpretation and debate, compared to previous documents signed by North Korea. The statement said North Korea (officially the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, or DPRK) committed to \u201cwork towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d The phrase is not defined and \u201ctoward\u201d is rather weak. In the past, North Korea viewed \u201cdenuclearization\u201d to mean the United States removing the nuclear umbrella it provides to Japan and South Korea; there is no indication its definition has changed.", "lang": "en"}
