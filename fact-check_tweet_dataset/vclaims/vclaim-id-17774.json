And this is exactly what he is doing, and this is clearly visible to us all,\u201d Peskov said.\n\nPeskov said that despite Poroshenko\u2019s \u201crelatively weak electoral positions,\u201d the United States was stuck \u201cbabysitting\u201d him on account of the sunk cost fallacy.\n\n\"Too much money was invested into Ukraine, too much money was poured into the coup in Ukraine, and justifying this coup also requires too much money,\u201d Peskov said.\n\nKremlin officials and the state media in Russia label the popular pro-EU uprising in Ukraine a \"coup\" when in reality the movement was civilian in nature and involved no military support.\n\nClaiming Washington is waiting for its investment in Ukraine to \u201cyield dividends,\u201d Peskov said the U.S. \u201cdid not quite succeed\u201d and now needs to do its best \u201cto save the situation.\u201d\n\n\"Washington has to support Poroshenko and turn a blind eye to the real situation, which is exactly what it is doing now,\u201d he said.\n\nTensions between Russia and Ukraine flared following a November 25 incident, in which three Ukrainian ships attempting to transit through the Kerch Strait in the Sea of Azov were fired on and then captured by Russian vessels.\n\nThe following day, martial law was introduced in Ukraine for 30 days in the 10 regions that would be on the front lines of a military conflict with Russia.\n\nRussian media and officials have argued that Poroshenko provoked the incident in the Sea of Azov as a pretext to introduce martial law and buoy his electoral prospects.\n\nDuring his annual year-end press conference, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Poroshenko had sent Ukrainian servicemen to die in the Sea of Azov to provoke Russia and boost his approval ratings.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry has gone so far as to claim that Kyiv is planning a chemical weapons attack in Ukraine\u2019s war-torn east.\n\nPeskov\u2019s claim that the U.S. funded the \u201ccoup\u201d in Ukraine is false.\n\nWhile not stated explicitly, his comment is likely based on a claim promulgated by Russian state media that the U.S. invested $5 billion in the Ukrainian uprising.\n\nPolitifact reported the claim stems from a December 2013 speech by then Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland to the U.S.-Ukraine Foundation, a non-governmental agency promoting democracy in Ukraine.\n\nIn that speech, Nuland said that the United States had invested over $5 billion since Ukraine\u2019s independence in 1991 to help the country \u201cbuild democratic skills and institutions\u201d so it can \u201cachieve its European aspirations.\u201d\n\nAs Brian Bohm noted in the Moscow Times in May 2014: \u201cU.S. law prohibits the funding of opposition leaders and movements, and there have been no violations of this law in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nSince the annexation of Crimea and Russian-backed war erupted in Ukraine in 2014, the U.S. has provided Ukraine with more than $1 billion in security assistance.\n\nIn July, the Pentagon told CNN it had released $200 million in security assistance to Ukraine.\n\nIn March, the U.S. State Department formally approved the sale of 210 Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine and 37 launchers for an estimated cost of $47 million. That was the first time lethal military aid to Kyiv has been approved.\n\nCiting the U.S. Congressional Research Service (CRS), the Council on Foreign Relations said the U.S. had spent $49 billion on foreign aid in 2016, around 1.2 percent of the federal budget. That included security and military assistance.\n\nUSAID, which put total U.S. obligations at $50 billion that year, said $513 million, or roughly 1% of the total, had gone to Ukraine.\n\nThe idea that U.S. support for Ukraine is based strictly on a need to \u201crecoup an investment\u201d and not on broader security issues in the region does not appear to be supported by the data.\n\nAs for Peskov\u2019s argument that the U.S. funded the 2014 revolution in Ukraine, Polygraph.info finds that claim to be false.", "lang": "en"}
