Was hard to see from the images I was seeing so I went there on my own, to Google Earth. Here\u2019s what I found and how you get there. That\u2019s one massive disturbance in the ocean down there and who knows what really caused it. Maybe now we know the source of The Bloop! Go there on Google Earth and form your own opinion. Coords below if you don\u2019t want to follow in vid. nav:\n\nWhile YouTube user \u201cWowforreal\u201d was skeptical about the findings, the video was later picked up by conspiracy theorist web sites that claimed that the footage likely showed a kraken (i.e., a legendary sea monster of giant size):\n\nThis looks like the Kraken. I used Google ruler and it says this is 30 meters (100 feet) from head to end, but the end looks like just the mid area of a giant squid, which means it could be 60+ meteres long with tentacles. That sounds like a Kraken to me. Maybe the stories about the giant monsters of the deep are all true. A lot of storers are based on truths. I think we found the Kraken.\n\nExamining Google Earth images from the coordinates provided by WowForReal (63\u00b0 2\u201956.73\u2033S 60\u00b057\u201932.38\u2033W) yielded similar results to those shown in the above-displayed video, but the \u201cunknown object\u201d seen therein; is not a sea monster but a rock. To be specific, it\u2019s Sail Rock, a small volcano located to the southwest of Deception Island at the same coordinates of the \u201cmassive unknown creature\u201d:\n\nAccording to a study published by Andean Geology in 2013, Sail Rock (named for its sail-like shape) stands about 30 meters above sea level:\n\n\u201c(Sail Rock) rises about 30 m above sea level and features a sail-like shape (hence its name). The stack marks the top of a volcano the rest of which is submerged below sea level. The age of Sail Rock is unknown, and the stack is composed of layers of pyroclastic breccia and tuffs alternating with lava flows.", "lang": "en"}
