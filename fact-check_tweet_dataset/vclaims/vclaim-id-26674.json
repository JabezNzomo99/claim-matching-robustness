Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nWhen the actual news videos on \u2018CNN\u2019 are observed, it can be seen that the words on the white strip at the bottom of the frame are always capitalized. But, all the letters of the words in the posted photo are not capitalized.\n\n\n\nWhen the photo of TV host (Don Lemon) is cropped from the posted photo and ran through Yandex Reverse Image Search, the same photo with the same expression can be found in an article published ten months back.\n\nGenerally, Don Lemon\u2019s show \u2018CNN Tonight\u2019 is aired on weekdays between 10 pm and 12 am ET. But, the time in the posted photo is 9:01 pm ET and the breaking news about the death of Al-Baghdadi came on Sunday. According to Snopes article, \u201cthe CNN\u2019s actual broadcast that announced the death of al-Baghdadi featured CNN anchor Jake Tapper, who reported on Trump\u2019s announcement concerning the IS leader\u2019s death and the chyron for that broadcast was: \u2018President Trump Announces ISIS Leader Al-Baghdadi Is Dead.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso, on the Twitter handle of \u2018CNN Breaking News\u2019 and the CNN live updates page on the event, nowhere it was not found that \u2018CNN\u2019 has called Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as \u2018unarmed father of three\u2019.\n\nTo sum it up, \u2018CNN\u2019 has not called ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as \u2018unarmed father of three\u2019. The image being shared on social media is a digitally manipulated one. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
