It refers to Michigan\u2019s Governor Gretchen Whitmer (D).\n\nThe claim comes amid a series of demonstrations against coronavirus-related lockdowns across key electoral battleground states like Michigan ( here ).\n\nThe article has been flagged multiple times as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to curb misinformation related to the new coronavirus.\n\nThe claim is false. It stems from a satirical article on the website The People\u2019s Cube. The article lists the author as \u201cChedoh, Kommissar of Viral Infections, Hero of Change, Prophet of the Future Truth\u201d. Despite these red flags, some social media users believe the story is authentic, making comments like \u201cYou need to vote her out!\u201d and \u201cThe Power all Democrats want\u201d.\n\nOn March 24, Whitmer passed an executive order suspending non-essential activities across the state ( here ). On April 13, Whitmer issued another executive order to extend the lockdown measures until April 30 ( here ). Neither of the orders specified enforcement conditions aside from mentioning that, \u201cConsistent with MCL 10.33 and MCL 30.405(3), a willful violation of this order is a misdemeanor\u201d. Michigan is one of 42 states where governors have ordered residents to remain indoors except for necessary outings like grocery shopping or doctor\u2019s visits, while closing schools, universities and non-essential businesses.\n\nThe move sparked protests in the state. On April 15, thousands of demonstrators in cars with horns honking thronged around Michigan\u2019s state Capitol, some chanting \u201clock her up,\u201d to protest against stay-at-home orders ( here ). The crowd included militia members and individuals carrying assault-style rifles and other guns, a reflection of Michigan\u2019s \u201copen-carry\u201d firearms laws.\n\nOn April 17, President Donald Trump took to Twitter to express his support for the anti-lockdown demonstrations, writing \u201cLiberate Michigan!\u201d in capital letters ( here ).\n\nA Reuters review of the organizers of last week\u2019s Michigan rally against Whitmer\u2019s stay-at-home order showed they are involved in the Republican president\u2019s re-election effort ( here ).\n\nMichigan is one of the states hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 33,000 cases confirmed as of April 24 ( here ).\n\nFalse: Michigan Governor Whitmer has not authorized \u201clethal force\u201d to maintain lockdown measures meant to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. This claim comes from a satirical article.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our fact checking work here .", "lang": "en"}
