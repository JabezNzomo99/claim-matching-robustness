Showcasing the supposed popularity of the Gandhis was a set of photographs posted along with the tweet.\n\nThe tweet has now been deleted, but the archived version can be accessed here. Chaturvedi had posted four photos, out of which the second photograph showed a massive crowd.\n\nThe same image was posted by many Congress supporters on various social media platforms, claiming it to be of Lucknow rally.\n\nUpon zooming into the image, one can see that the language painted on buildings is a South Indian language, which would be typically unusual for a rally in Lucknow.\n\nThe above photo was taken not at the rally held by Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi in Lucknow, but at the Congress party\u2019s roadshow in Telangana which had taken place in December 2018, ahead of the assembly election in the state.\n\nIn fact, the same photograph among others had been tweeted by former cricketer and Congress leader Mohammed Azharuddin on December 5, 2018. It was also posted by a Youth Congress leader.\n\nAfter deleting her initial tweet, Priyanka Chaturvedi later posted another tweet, acknowledging her error.\n\nUse of old, unrelated photographs for political propaganda is an easy tactic, and numerous such instances have been observed in the past.", "lang": "en"}
