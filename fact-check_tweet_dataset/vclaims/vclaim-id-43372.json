On March 24, a post claimed U.S. researchers have developed a vaccine against COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\n\u201cGreat News! Carona (sic) virus vaccine ready. Able to cure patients within 3 hours after injection,\u201d reads the post. \u201cRight now Trump announced that the Roche Medical Company will launch the vaccine next Sunday and millions of doses are ready from it!!!\u201d\n\nIt also appears to imply that an accompanying photo of medical sachets shows the alleged vaccine.\n\nHad U.S. researchers developed a vaccine, it would have been picked up by major media outlets, yet none have reported on it. President Donald Trump also has not mentioned anything to that effect in press briefings, nor has he put anything on his Twitter accounts.\n\nThe World Health Organization notes on its website that there is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-19.\n\n\u201cRoche Medical Company\u201d likely references the biotech firm Roche. On March 19, the company did announce that it would be conducting a clinical trial to see if the drug tocilizumab is an effective treatment for COVID-19 patients with pneumonia, but Roche has not made any announcements of a coronavirus vaccine.\n\nThe photo of the medical sachets shows COVID-19 testing kits from a South Korean company called Sugentech \u2013 not a vaccine, as the post seems to falsely imply.
