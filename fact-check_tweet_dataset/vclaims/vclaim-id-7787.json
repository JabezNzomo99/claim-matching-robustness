This article is bogus.\n\nThe same story appeared in March 2017 on the website Empire News, a website with a disclaimer that it is for entertainment purposes only.\n\nThe story said that police received an anonymous tip about a horrible burning smell from the back of the Walmart. An officer discovered a meth lab that took up the entire back room.\n\nThe story stated that an \"unofficial spokesperson did say that they were \u2018disappointed\u2019 that they weren\u2019t able to use their company discount to get meth before the place was shut down.\"\n\nOne sign that this story is fake news: It provides a lengthy quote from \"Chief Robert Garner,\" even though in Decatur the police chief\u2019s name is Nate Allen. He told PolitiFact that there was no such bust.\n\n\"This is fake news, and no, we don\u2019t have a Chief Robert Garner,\" Allen said in an email.\n\nTara Aston, a spokeswoman for Walmart, told PolitiFact in an email that the company was unaware of any meth lab being discovered at an Alabama store.\n\nWhile we found no news reports about busts of meth labs inside an Alabama Walmart, we did find some news reports about busts involving mobile meth labs in Walmart parking lots. In August 2016, police discovered a meth lab inside a 6-foot-high drainage pipe under a Walmart parking lot in Amherst, N.Y.\n\nThe \"about\" section of the Ufconly website doesn\u2019t describe the website\u2019s content and instead stated that \"Ufconly is a small village in the mountains of the Western Cape, South Africa.\" We found no such place.\n\nThere is no evidence that police discovered a meth lab inside a Walmart in Decatur, Ala.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
