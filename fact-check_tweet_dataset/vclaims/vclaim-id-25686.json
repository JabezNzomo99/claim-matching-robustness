The polling company also made reference to one of its polls in another tweet, with a pie chart illustration that showed the responses, by percentage, from self-described Unionists (people voting for DUP, UUP, and other Unionist parties) to the question, \u201cIf a referendum took place in NI tomorrow with the question \u2014 \u2018Should there be a NI specific Backstop as part of Brexit?\u2019 \u2014 which way would you vote?\u201d:\n\u2022 15.0%: As part of Brexit, there should be a Northern Ireland-only \u2018Backstop\u2019 with Northern Ireland more closely aligned with the EU than the rest of the UK\n\u2022 81.0%: As part of Brexit, there should not be a Northern Ireland-only \u2018Backstop\u2019 and Northern Ireland should leave the EU on exactly the same terms as the rest of the UK\n\u2022 4.0%: Not sure/Don\u2019t know, but would probably vote\n\nJenkins linked to an article (\u00a3) in the Sunday Times to underpin his statistics. The Sunday Times article was based on LucidTalk\u2019s Tracker poll from August 2019, and stated \u201c[A]lmost three out of five voters in Northern Ireland are in favour of a \u201cborder in the Irish Sea.\u201d It also noted that \u201cone in six unionists support the Northern Ireland-only backstop.\u201d In both cases there is a slight rounding up of the numbers. To be precise, 58.4% of the overall population and 15% of unionists favour a NI specific backstop. Nonetheless, the Sunday Times figures are close to the mark.\n\nThe latest LucidTalk tracker poll was conducted between 9th-12th August 2019 and was sent to their panel of 12,762 members \u201cwhich is balanced by gender, age group, area of residence, and community background, in order to be demographically representative of Northern Ireland (NI).\u201d 2,302 responses were received. LucidTalk explain that the \u201cdata was weighted by age, sex, socio-economic group, previous voting patterns (i.e. election turnout estimation), constituency, constitutional position, party support and religious affiliation\u201d which resulted in \u201c1,252 full responses [being] used for analysis in terms of the final results\u201d. They go on to say that all \u201cdata results produced are accurate to a margin of error of +/-2.6%, at 95% confidence\u201d.\n\nWhat is a \u201cborder in the Irish Sea\u201d?\n\nA \u201cborder in the Irish Sea\u201d is not a legal term within the Brexit negotiations. However, it has become shorthand for the concept that Northern Ireland should retain a closer relationship with the European Union than Britain does, in the context of Brexit. This has become known as the \u201cbackstop\u201d.\n\nThe Institute of Government provide more detail and a timeline for the evolution of the backstop. They state:\n\n\u201cIn February 2018, the European Commission published a draft Withdrawal Agreement which, to deliver the backstop, proposed keeping Northern Ireland within the EU customs territory and \u2018common regulatory area\u2019 covering goods and sanitary and phytosanitary regulations. This approach, a \u2018Northern Ireland specific\u2019 backstop, would require customs and regulatory checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland if it ever came into force.\u201d\n\nResponding to concerns that this would entail Northern Ireland being treated differently to the rest of the UK, then Prime Minister Theresa May and the EU agreed a further draft Withdrawal Agreement in November 2018. This contained a Joint Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which included a provision that there would be no regulatory barriers in the Irish sea. This essentially widened the backstop to include all of the UK in a de facto \u201csingle customs territory\u201d with the EU.\n\nThe purpose of the backstop is, in the words of Full Fact, \u201can insurance policy\u201d to ensure that the Irish border remains open, regardless of what happens in future negotiations between the UK and the EU. The draft Withdrawal Agreement did not envisage the backstop kicking in until after an agreed transition period, and only then if negotiations broke down and no alternative arrangements had been agreed.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Withdrawal Agreement has been defeated in the UK Parliament three times. July 2019 saw a new Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, enter office. Johnson does not approve of the backstop and has accelerated preparations for a \u2018No Deal\u2019 Brexit.\n\nImplementation of a Northern Ireland specific backstop would entail some checks on goods entering Northern Ireland ports from Britain, while preventing checks at the Irish border. This has led to the emergence of the term, \u201cborder in the Irish Sea\u201d.\n\nWhere does the 40% come from?\n\nIn the LucidTalk August 2019 poll, the words \u201cborder in the Irish sea\u201d were not used, but \u201ca NI only \u2018Backstop\u2019\u201d were. As explained above, we interpret Jenkin\u2019s \u201cborder down the Irish Sea\u201d as meaning reference to \u201ca NI only \u2018Backstop\u2019\u201d.\n\nIf we separate the results by political party, there are some variations in unionist support. 27% of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) would vote for a NI specific backstop, as would 14% of \u201cOther PUL (Protestant/Loyalist/Unionist)\u201d parties. Only 5% of Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) voters said they would support this policy. The UUP and Other PUL figures are quoted in the Sunday Times article: \u201c\u2026 27% of Ulster Unionist supporters and 14% who voted for other unionists or loyalist candidates were in favour of compromise\u201d. These two figures add up to 41%.\n\nHowever, the poll results by political party are relevant only for each party. For example, for all UUP respondents: 27% supported a backstop, 69% did not, and 4% were uncertain. For \u201cOther PLU\u201d respondents: 14% supported a backstop, 80% do not, and 6% were uncertain. As can be seen in the following table, these add up to 100% for each party, but this does not mean that 41% represent unionist (or Unionist parties) support for a backstop. This is because of the different number of responses received from self-ascribed DUP, UUP, and Other PUL voters; there were more DUP than UUP than Other PUL respondents.\n\nJenkins\u2019 claim may thus be based on a misreading of political party responses.\n\nAnother explanation for the 40% figure could be that Jenkins may have heard the previously fact-checked analysis that \u201c60% of Unionist people are opposed to the Backstop on economic grounds\u201d, and extrapolated that 40% of unionists must therefore support it.\n\nWe have attempted to contact Mr Jenkins to clarify the source of the data or his process in arriving at this figure, but to date have received no reply.\n\nYet however the cause, the claim that 40% of unionists support a Northern Ireland specific backstop, and are therefore \u201chappy about a border down the Irish sea\u201d, is inaccurate.\n\nSimon Jenkins wrote an article in the Guardian claiming that 40% of unionists supported a border in the Irish sea.\n\nThe data appears to refer to LucidTalk\u2019s August 2019 Tracker poll, co-commissioned by The Sunday Times, which asked if people in Northern Ireland would vote for a Northern Ireland specific backstop.\n\nThe number of people who expressed a preference for a unionist political party who said they would vote for such a backstop in this poll was 15%, while 81% were opposed.\n\nThe claim may be based on a misinterpretation of data in this or other polls.\n\nImage: Photo by Sergii FIGURNYI used by license Dreamstime.com\n\nFactCheckNI is Northern Ireland\u2019s first and only dedicated independent fact-checking service and a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network\u2019s Code of Principles.
