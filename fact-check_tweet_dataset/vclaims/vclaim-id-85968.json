Although The Washington Post did not have a Fact Checker column during the bulk of the George W. Bush administration, it\u2019s possible the reverse might have been true when Bush was president, given the animus that the left held for the 43rd president.\n\n1: Obama\u2019s pledge that \u2018no one will take away\u2019 your health plan\n\nFirst place goes to our lengthy examination of the president\u2019s memorable pledge that, under the Affordable Care Act, \u201cno one will take away\u201d your health plan. Though the White House has since backed off this claim \u2014 made repeatedly by the president during the crafting of the law and in recent months \u2014 we concluded that it was worthy of Four Pinocchios because of the frequency with which he made it and because of the impact of regulations crafted by the administration. (This column also topped the biggest Pinocchios list.)\n\n2: Obama\u2019s claim that he called Benghazi an \u2018act of terror\u2019\n\nObama did refer to an \u201cact of terror\u201d in the immediate aftermath of the Benghazi attack, but in vague terms, wrapped in a patriotic fervor. He never stated that the U.S. ambassador died because of an \u201cact of terror.\u201d Then, over a period of two weeks, given three opportunities in interviews to affirmatively agree that the Benghazi attack was a terrorist attack, the president obfuscated or ducked the question. He earned Four Pinocchios. (Also on biggest Pinocchios list.)\n\nHere, we took to task Republican claims that the president exempted more than 1,200 groups, including members of Congress, from the health-care law. This was greatly overstated. Though Republicans give the impression that vast segments of politically connected \u201cgroups\u201d have been excused from the health-care law, it was really just a one-year waiver intended to make the transition to the new system easier for people with bare-bones insurance. The issue concerning Congress is more complex, but the bottom line is that the administration\u2019s action was intended to reduce an unintended burden, not carve out an exception. The claims earned Three Pinocchios.\n\n5: The White House\u2019s curious silence about Obama\u2019s claim of skeet shooting\n\nThis was a very controversial subject for a fact check. Initially, we thought it was curious that the White House would not respond to questions about the president\u2019s statement that he goes skeet shooting \u201call the time\u201d while at Camp David. We noted that there was no history of Obama ever speaking about this pastime \u2013 and that he rarely visits Camp David. We concluded with a \u201cverdict pending\u201d and urged the release of a photograph. Two days later, the White House did release a photograph \u2014 and some readers were upset that we did not immediately change our ruling to a Geppetto Checkmark. But in the end we said the issue was settled.\n\n6: Ted Cruz\u2019s claims on Obamacare focus on losers, not winners\n\nWe faulted the junior senator from Texas for always focusing on the losers from the law, without acknowledging that there are winners as well. The full impact of the health-care law will not be known for years, and there are bound to be winners and losers in any major change in social policy. By focusing just on the losers, in such stark terms, Cruz undercuts his ability to highlight what he considers the flaws in Obamacare. This column examined a number of his specific claims, finally settling on an overall rating of Two Pinocchios.\n\n7: 4 Pinocchios for a slashing NRA ad on security at Sidwell Friends School\n\nThe National Rifle Association, in a tough television ad on gun-control measures and in a longer four-minute video presentation, highlighted what it saw as \u201celitist\u201d hypocrisy by Obama because his children are \u201cprotected by armed guards at their school.\u201d While the law requires the president\u2019s children to have Secret Service protection, the ad clearly referred to armed security guards at Sidwell Friends School. But the guards there do not carry guns, so the ad was based on a false premise, earning it Four Pinocchios. (Biggest Pinocchios list)\n\nThis column examined three key statements made in May by Lois G. Lerner, at the time the IRS\u2019s director of the exempt organizations division, concerning the disclosure by the IRS that it had targeted conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. The statements all fell short in the wake of the facts that later emerged about the controversy, and so she earned Four Pinocchios. In September, Lerner resigned from the IRS after an internal review board determined that she should be removed from the agency for \u201cneglect of duties.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s a politician on the right who inspires as much attention as Obama does on the left, it would be Sarah Palin. (Another Palin fact check is also in the top 20.) She argued that Mitt Romney lost the support of so-called Reagan Democrats in swing states, thus costing him the election, and that Hispanic voters do not favor a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Neither assertion was borne out by the data. Among Hispanics, there is overwhelming support for policies that would provide a path to citizenship. Meanwhile, Obama did more poorly among white working-class voters in 2012 than in 2008, even in key swing states. Palin earned Three Pinocchios.\n\nEarlier this year, we were curious to look back at Obama\u2019s 2006 speech in the Senate and examine the case he made at the time for not supporting a boost in the debt limit. The young senator from Illinois presumably did not want to buck the rest of his party establishment in voting for increasing the debt limit \u2014 not when there were just enough Republicans willing to support a president from their own party. But we noted that Obama would be on much more solid ground for arguing for an increase in the debt limit if he had given a speech back in 2006 that sounded more like his news conferences in 2013. He earned a rare upside-down Pinocchio, signifying a major-league flip-flop.\n\n10: Why is the national debt $16 trillion?\n\nAt the start of the year, when Congress and the White House were battling over the fiscal cliff and the national debt limit, we offered a refresher course on the source of the nation\u2019s $16 trillion debt. The data show that the growth of the debt in the last three decades has been a bipartisan enterprise, with only Bill Clinton reducing debt as a percentage of the U.S. economy. But even during his presidency, debt owed to Social Security, Medicare and the like kept climbing as a share of the U.S. economy. Indeed, an increasingly large portion of the debt is money that the government owes to itself because of borrowing from large entitlement programs such as Social Security and the Medicare. No Pinocchios were awarded, as this column was intended to explain a complex issue.", "lang": "en"}
