Replies Of The Viral Tweets Do Not Exist On searching for replies to the viral tweets, the microblogging sites doesn't show any results. Usually on typing 'to:(twitter handle)' in the search bar, it gives out a list of replies to any tweet of a particular handle, even if the tweets have been deleted.

The user's bio is seen under the following button. Below is a screenshot of how it appears on Twitter:\n\nErtugrul, a 13th-century Turkish warrior, belonged to the nomadic Muslim Oghuz tribe Kayi, and was father of Osman I, the founder of the Ottoman empire. With S\u00f6g\u00fct as their base, Osman and the Muslim frontier warriors (Ghazis) under his command waged a slow and stubborn conflict against the Byzantines, who sought to defend their territories in the hinterland of the Asiatic shore opposite Constantinople (now Istanbul). Historical series 'Resurrection: Ertugrul' is based on Turkish history during the Christian Crusades in Europe and the Middle-East in the early half of the previous millennium. The show goes back to a time when Aleppo in Syria was a 'cultural and economic hub when expansionist Christendom began to lay the insidious foundation of modern-day Islamophobia'.
