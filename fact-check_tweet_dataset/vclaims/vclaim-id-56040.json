The woman in the viral photo is Swiss actress Ursula Andress. It was taken on the sets of \u201cDr. No\u201d, the first movie in the James Bond series.\n\nThe misleading post is being shared on Twitter as well. Some Twitter users have mischievously asked others to identify the woman. The archived version can be seen here.\n\nA simple reverse search revealed the truth behind the photo. Many websites have used this picture and said it was taken on the sets of \u201cDr. No\u201d.\n\nIMDB had also used the picture in its photo gallery and captioned it, \u201cSean Connery, Ursula Andress, and Terence Young in Dr. No (1962)\u201d.\n\nUrsula Andress is a Swiss actress who has appeared in American, British and Italian movies. She is best known for her role as \u201cHoney Ryder\u201d, opposite James Bond, in \u201cDr. No\u201d. In this movie, Sean Connery had played the role of James Bond, the fictional British Secret Service agent.\n\nThis is not the first time pictures of Ursula Andress have been passed off as Sonia Gandhi. Multiple scenes from \u201cDr. No\u201d in which she was seen in a bikini were passed off as Sonia Gandhi earlier. Those were also fact-checked.", "lang": "en"}
