Moreover, the prognosis for the next 15 years are pessimistic.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "April 16, 2019", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-14731", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-g20-mortality/29884611.html", "vclaim": "According to Russia\u2019s state statistics agency Rosstat, the overall mortality rate in Russia has decreased by almost a quarter since 2005. However, Rosstat does not believe such rates of decrease will continue over the next 15 years. Moreover, the mortality rate is expected to rise again by the mid-2030s.\n\n\u200bFor international comparisons, so-called \u201cstandardized\u201d indicators are used, which take into account the age structure of a country\u2019s populace. Of course, countries where the proportion of \u201cyoung\u201d generations is higher will have lower simple indicators of total mortality than countries in which the proportion of older people is higher.\n\nWe have used these indicators to compare the G20 countries, which together account for more than 80% of global GDP. The most recent estimates for individual countries submitted by the World Health Organization (WHO) are for 2016:\n\nThe very structure of mortality in Russia has changed markedly over the past decade. The proportion of diseases of the cardiovascular system (the single largest cause of death), dropped from 57.1 percent of all deaths in 2008 to 46.3 percent in 2018, while the percentage of deaths due to \u201cexternal causes\u201d (including traffic accidents, murders and suicides, poisoning, etc.), dropped markedly \u2013 from 11.8 percent in 2008 to 7.2 percent in 2018.\n\nAt the same time, the percentage of neoplasms (the vast majority of them malignant) grew among the causes of death, from 13.9 percent in 2008 to 15.9 percent in 2018, while the percentage deaths from diseases of the nervous system increased nearly nine-fold -- from 0.7 percent of the total in 2008 to 6.2 percent in 2018.\n\nThe mortality rate in Russia from all cardiovascular diseases has indeed decreased by 37% the past 13 years, according to Rosstat. Yet, according to the WHO, Russia\u2019s rate of death from cardiovascular disease remains the highest in the G20, and almost twice the world average:\n\nFatalities from traffic accidents in Russia have decreased significantly over the last 13 years, from a high of 18.2 per 100,000 people in 2007 to 9.7 per 100,000 people in 2018. That is 15 percent lower than the world average but higher than the G20 average:\n\nMortality from tuberculosis has decreased in Russia by a factor of four since 2005, according to Rosstat, and, according to the WHO, the number of tuberculosis deaths in Russia in 2016 was 2.6 times lower than the world average (6.5 deaths per 100,000 vs. 16.9 deaths per 100,000). Still, Russia had the fourth highest rate of deaths from tuberculosis among the G20 countries, although the three countries with the highest rates \u2013 India, South Africa and Indonesia \u2013 had rates much higher than Russia\u2019s.\n\nThis fact check is translated from our partner, Factograph.info.", "lang": "en"}
