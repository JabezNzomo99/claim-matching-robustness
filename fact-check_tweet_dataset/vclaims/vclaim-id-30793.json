Biden Jr. remains atop most national polls before the first votes are cast next month in the Democratic presidential primary. Before the Iowa caucuses, The New York Times reviewed recent statements he made defending his decades-long career, stressing his standing in the black community and highlighting his perceived strength on foreign policy. Here\u2019s a fact check. Mr. Biden tried to defend his record on Social Security and birth control with questionable claims. Antonia Hylton, a reporter for Vice News: \u201cDo you think, though, that it\u2019s fair for voters to question your commitment to Social Security when in the past you\u2019ve proposed a freeze to it?\u201d Mr. Biden: \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t propose a freeze.\u201d\n\n\u2014 at the Brown & Black Democratic Presidential Forum last week in Iowa False. In 1984, faced with budget deficits under the Reagan administration, Mr. Biden was a co-sponsor of an amendment with two Republican senators that froze for one year nearly all military and domestic spending, including cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security benefits.\n\nPressed by Ms. Hylton after his inaccurate denial, Mr. Biden said that his proposal came \u201cin the context of we saved Social Security during the Reagan administration\u201d and noted that Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, a liberal stalwart, voted for the plan. When President Ronald Reagan entered office in 1981, Social Security was running low on funding and Mr. Reagan did propose to make deep cuts to benefits. But he ultimately endorsed and signed bipartisan legislation in 1983 \u2014 which Mr. Biden and Mr. Kennedy both voted for \u2014 to assure the fund\u2019s continuing solvency. Changes included postponing cost-of-living adjustments, and the Biden campaign said that the former vice president was referring to this episode. \u201cIt is easy to believe Biden thought minor cuts in the program in the short run would represent a better outcome than the much bigger cuts President Reagan and his advisers seemed to favor,\u201d Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said. \u201cIn those days, \u2018compromise\u2019 was not a dirty word in the eyes of most members of Congress.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s own freeze plan, though, came \u201cwell after the Social Security rescue was over,\u201d said Paul C. Light, a professor at New York University who wrote a book on the 1983 effort. Rather, the plan was another step in a decades-long \u201cmating dance between centrist Democrats and Republicans to come up with a grand bargain on the deficit,\u201d said Eric Laursen, author of \u201cThe People\u2019s Pension: The Struggle to Defend Social Security Since Reagan.\u201d\n\nThe making of the rule sparked an internal debate in the White House. Reporting from news outlets cast Mr. Biden as part of the camp arguing for a less stringent rule. According to ABC News and Bloomberg, the vice president and William Daley, then the chief of staff to President Barack Obama, warned of the political fallout with Catholic voters who backed Mr. Obama in the 2008 election and argued that the issue would be framed as an attack on religious liberty. The Times reported that officials had initially sought a year to work out a compromise, but \u201ca group of advisers had bested Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and others and sold the president on a stricter rule.\u201d The announcement fueled a fierce backlash from Catholic organizations and Republicans. As the Obama administration contemplated the fallout, Mr. Biden did not publicly oppose or defend the rule, but hinted during a radio interview that it would be softened. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a significant attempt to work this out, and there\u2019s time to do that,\u201d he said on Feb. 9, 2012. \u201cAnd as a practicing Catholic, you know, I am of the view that this can be worked out and should be worked out and I think the president, I know the president, feels the same way.\u201d Mr. Biden also said in the interview that the administration wanted to \u201cmake sure women who need access to birth control are not denied that,\u201d according to The Wall Street Journal. A day later, the administration revised the rule to shift the responsibility of providing contraception to insurers, rather than the religiously affiliated institutions themselves. Mr. Biden overstated his support among young black voters and his role in the civil rights movement. Ms. Hylton: \u201cWhy is Senator Sanders leading you with voters under age 35?\u201d Mr. Biden: \u201cHe is not leading me with black voters under the age \u2014 look, just all I know is, I am leading everybody, combined, with black voters.\u201d\n\n\u2014 at the Brown & Black forum\n\nThis is exaggerated. Mr. Biden is correct that in most polls, he leads Democratic candidates among black voters overall, but he is wrong to deny Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 edge with younger African Americans. A January poll conducted by The Washington Post and Ipsos, a nonpartisan research firm, found that Mr. Biden held a wide lead among black Democrats with 48 percent support, but Mr. Sanders led with those between age 18 and 34 at 42 percent while Mr. Biden placed second at 30 percent. An Ipsos survey conducted with Vice this month asked black Americans who they would consider voting for and found that 56 percent would consider voting for Mr. Sanders and 54 percent for Mr. Biden, a statistical tie. Among those between ages 18 and 34, Mr. Sanders\u2019 support increased to 81 percent compared with 65 percent for Mr. Biden, according to a breakdown provided by Chris Jackson, the vice president of Ipsos Public Affairs. In a poll by the political action committee BlackPac and released in December, Mr. Biden led all black voters with 38 percent, but trailed Mr. Sanders in support among black voters between ages 18 and 24 at 14 percent compared to 30 percent for Mr. Sanders. Support for the two candidates was nearly identical among black voters between the ages of 25 and 39, with 24 percent supporting Mr. Biden and 25 percent supporting Mr. Sanders. The Sanders campaign also pointed to an array of surveys demonstrating the same generational gap: a fall poll from Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Institute of Politics where Mr. Sanders was the first choice of black voters between ages 18 and 29, a January poll from the Chegg/College Pulse Student Election Tracker where Mr. Sanders led with black college students with 43 percent and a September survey from Essence Magazine where Mr. Sanders had the most support of black women between ages 18 and 34 with 19 percent. \u201cI was involved in the civil rights movement.\u201d\n\n\u2014 at the Brown & Black forum This is exaggerated. Over his long political career, Mr. Biden has occasionally suggested he played a greater role in the civil rights movement of the 1960s than he actually did. While there are accounts of Mr. Biden participating in a few desegregation events, he has also said he would not consider himself an activist in the movement. Mr. Biden has said that he protested a segregated movie theater in demonstrations in Wilmington, Del. at the Rialto Theater in the early 1960s. His account is backed by a former president of the state chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and a former president of the Delaware A.F.L.-C.I.O.\n\nA 1987 edition of \u201cCurrent Biography Yearbook,\u201d a magazine that profiles American figures, noted that Mr. Biden had participated in \u201canti-segregation sit-ins at Wilmington\u2019s Town Theatre during his high school years.\u201d During his first bid for president, Mr. Biden wrongly said in 1987 that he had \u201cmarched with tens of thousands of others\u201d in the civil rights movement. Later, a spokesman for Mr. Biden clarified that he had participated in actions to \u201cdesegregate one restaurant and one movie theater.\u201d Mr. Biden himself conceded that \u201cI was not an activist.\u201d \u201cI worked at an all-black swimming pool in the east side of Wilmington, Del. I was involved in what they were thinking, what they were feeling. But I was not out marching,\u201d he said in a news conference that fall. \u201cI was not down in Selma. I was not anywhere else. I was a suburbanite kid who got a dose of exposure to what was happening to black Americans.\u201d He struck a similar tone in interviews with the journalist Jules Witcover, who wrote the book \u201cJoe Biden: A Life of Trial and Redemption.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t do any big deal, but I marched a couple of times to desegregate the movie theaters in downtown Wilmington,\u201d Mr. Biden said in the book. But he acknowledged that \u201cI wasn\u2019t part of any great movement.\u201d \u201cThe president showed up, met with them, gave him legitimacy, weakened these sanctions we have against him.\u201d\n\n\u2014 at the Democratic presidential debate in January This is misleading. Mr. Biden is referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to engage diplomatically with North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un. There is a widespread consensus that the president\u2019s willingness to meet with him provided Mr. Kim with additional credibility at home and abroad without giving the United States and its allies much in return.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Trump\u2019s meetings with the North Koreans have increased support from China and Russia for easing United Nations sanctions on North Korea, as the Biden campaign pointed out. Soo Kim, a policy analyst at the RAND Corporation, a research group, pointed out that South Korea has also recently been testing the waters for securing sanctions relief for its northern neighbor. But the Trump administration itself has not lifted the United States\u2019 own sanctions and has opposed the calls from China and Russia to ease the international sanctions. \u201cAs far as I know, sanctions have not been eased,\u201d said Jim Walsh of the Security Studies Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cCertainly the international U.N. sanctions continue unabated, and I am unaware of any significant sanctions relief granted by the administration.\u201d A spokeswoman for the Treasury Department said Mr. Biden\u2019s statement was inaccurate and that the agency \u201chas sanctioned 261 individuals and entities under its North Korea authorities, accounting for more than half of North Korea-related sanctions ever imposed.\u201d Nearly every month from March 2017 to March 2018, the department announced sanctions on North Korean nationals and companies, as well people and entities around the world linked to North Korea. After Mr. Trump\u2019s summit with Mr. Kim in Singapore in June 2018, Treasury imposed more sanctions in August, September, October, November and December of that year. In March 2019, shortly after Mr. Trump met again with Mr. Kim in Hanoi, Vietnam, the president issued a confusing statement on Twitter announcing that he had rolled back newly imposed sanctions on North Korea, though restrictions announced a day earlier on two Chinese companies linked to North Korea were not actually revoked. The White House press secretary at the time, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, explained that Mr. Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel it\u2019s necessary to add additional sanctions at this time.\u201d A month later, Mr. Trump said the sanctions on North Korea are \u201cat a fair level\u201d and should remain in place. More were announced in June, August and September. The United States opposed lifting United Nations sanctions on North Korea in December and sanctioned two more entities January.", "lang": "en"}
