The government watchdog has announced Baswedan violated procedures, but it did not say he would be sacked.\n\nIndonesian website kataku.pw published an article on July 31, 2018, with a headline that translates to: \u201cASN Commission officially declares Anies Baswedan guilty and Anies will be removed from his position.\u201d\n\nThe ASN commission refers to the state civilian bureaucracy commission, or KASN, which investigates allegations of ethical violations in the public sector.\n\nThe article said Baswedan did not follow correct procedures when he dismissed a group of bureaucrats between January and July 2018.\n\nHowever the article did not repeat the claim in the headline that KASN had declared he would be dismissed.\n\nThe story has been posted to at least five Facebook groups, according to CrowdTangle, a social media monitoring tool.\n\nAll of the groups claim to be supporters of Baswedan\u2019s predecessor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, or President Joko Widodo, who is an ally of Purnama and governed Jakarta before winning the presidency in 2014.\n\nA KASN official told AFP that Baswedan had violated bureaucratic procedures, but the agency had not called for him to be removed from his job.\n\n\n\n \u201cWe don\u2019t even have the authority to order the removal of any governor,\u201d said Made Suwandi, a senior KASN official responsible for investigating alleged ethical violations.\n\nSuwandi described the report as \u201cpurely fabricated\u201d.\n\nA July 27 agency statement outlining its recommendations in the bureaucrat firing cases, which is available on its website, does not say it called for Jakarta\u2019s governor to be sacked.", "lang": "en"}
