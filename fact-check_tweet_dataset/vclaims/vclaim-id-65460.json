That\u2019s all,\u201d he concluded.\n\nTrump did, in fact, make these remarks, inspiring a Twitter frenzy that lasted into the next day.\n\nWith more than 16,000 related tweets, #NobodyLikesTrump became the fourth most popular hashtag on Twitter\u2019s July 29 trending list and sparked \u201cpoor me\u201d news reports that played on Trump\u2019s \u201cself-pity.\u201d\n\nThe quote went viral after Trump was asked by a reporter to respond to since-deleted tweets in which he reportedly accused Dr. Anthony Fauci of misleading the country in his response to the coronavirus pandemic. Fauci has been the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984 and became the face of the United States COVID-19 response at the onset of the pandemic.\n\nIn a long-winded reply beginning around the 20-minute mark of the video, Trump said that he had a \u201cvery good relationship with Dr. Fauci\u201d and that he listened to the adviser despite not always having agreed with his policies, particularly those related to the travel bans on China and Europe. Trump went on to speak to Fauci\u2019s \u201cvery good approval rating\u201d and described fellow White House Coronavirus Task Force member Dr. Deborah Birx as \u201cterrific.\u201d\n\nIn subsequent comments, the president then questioned his own approval rating with respect to the virus and appeared to doubt his likability:\n\nAnd he\u2019s [Fauci] got this high approval rating, so why don\u2019t I have a high approval rating with respect \u2014 and the administration, with respect to the virus? We should have a very high, because what we\u2019ve done in terms of \u2014 we\u2019re just reading off about the masks and the gowns and the ventilators and numbers that nobody has seen, and the testing at 55 million tests; we tested more than anybody in the world. I have a graph that I\u2019d love to show you \u2014 perhaps you\u2019ve seen it \u2014 where we\u2019re up here and the rest of the world is down at a level that\u2019s just a tiny fraction of what we\u2019ve done, in terms of testing. So it sort of is curious: A man works for us \u2014 with us, very closely, Dr. Fauci, and Dr. Birx also highly thought of. And yet, they\u2019re highly thought of, but nobody likes me. It can only be my personality. That\u2019s all.\n\nDuring the 26-minute long press conference, the president also provided an update to COVID-19 vaccine trials and announced a $765 million loan to support the launch of Kodak Pharmaceuticals that will allow the film company to \u201cproduce generic active pharmaceutical ingredients\u201d and \u201cmake the key starting materials\u201d for many drugs.", "lang": "en"}
