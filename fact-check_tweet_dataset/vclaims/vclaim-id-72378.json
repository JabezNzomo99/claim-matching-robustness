Kurt Schaefer took credit for boosting University of Missouri System funding.\n\nIn the ad, Schaefer, who represents Boone County, touted his accomplishments as the chair of the Missouri legislature\u2019s Senate Appropriations committee. Schaefer is wrapping up his second four-year term in the Senate. Barred by term limits from serving another term, he ran for attorney general but lost in the primary election to Josh Hawley.\n\nAmong his listed achievements was increased funding for the UM System. Schaefer wrote that he helped secure the largest amount of state funding for the four-campus system in the last two years since 2008.\n\nIn the fall of 2015, the total enrollment for the UM System was 59,807 full-time students. The fall of 2015 coincides with fiscal year 2016. Enrollment for 2016 dropped slightly: 57,778 students. By comparison, enrollment in 2008 was 51,012 students.\n\nThe protests, which began after students said administrators failed to address racism on campus, culminated in the resignation of then-UM System President Tim Wolfe in November 2015. Schaefer lambasted MU\u2019s handling of Melissa Click, a professor who stoked tension on the day of Wolfe\u2019s resignation when she asked for \"some muscle\" to remove a student journalist from a protest. In January, Schaefer and more 100 other legislators signed letters urging the UM System Board of Curators to fire Click. The curators voted to fire her in February. He also proposed a legislative commission this year to scrutinize the UM System\u2019s structure, including its diversity programs. Angry about a lack of university leadership during the protests, legislators advocated cutting the UM System\u2019s budget. Schaefer supported that effort, though he took strides to lessen the proposed cuts. The legislature cut appropriations to the system by $3.8 million for fiscal year 2017. Schaefer praised his work on the Senate Appropriations Committee, citing increased funding for the UM System as one of his accomplishments. But it\u2019s clear from the data that state funding has not kept pace with rising inflation. In reality, state funding for the UM System has decreased considerably since 2008, despite what Schaefer wrote in his ad. We rate his claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
