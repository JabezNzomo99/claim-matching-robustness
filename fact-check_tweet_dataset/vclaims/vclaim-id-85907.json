He\u2019s said it in at least three settings as of early February \u2014 in his last speech as governor, at the Iowa Freedom Summit and during an interview with our colleague Robert Costa.\n\nIt likely will come up again as Perry gears up for a 2016 presidential run, so we dug into it. Is Perry correct that almost one-third of all the new jobs in America since 2000 were created in Texas?\n\nPerry specified net new job gains in previous iterations of this claim, such as one that ran in an advertisement in 2013 in the Austin American-Statesman. Perry did not clarify this in recent speeches, but his staff said Perry was still referring to the calculation of net new jobs.\n\nThey arrived at this figure by using Bureau of Labor Statistics data of the number of jobs created in Texas between 2000 and 2014, and dividing it by the number of new jobs created nationally during the same period. This data set uses payroll information from surveyed businesses, and Perry\u2019s calculation does not include public sector jobs.\n\nBut politicians can easily manipulate jobs numbers to paint the most dramatic numbers, and Perry\u2019s calculation is the highest possible one using the two data sets. His spokesman did not respond when we asked why they chose this particular calculation. (To see how states\u2019 employment numbers can rise and fall depending on the statistics and time periods that politicians choose, check out this interactive tool that Lori Williams, then at Tableau, made for The Fact Checker during Perry\u2019s last run for president.)\n\nThere is a disconnect comparing the particular state and national employment data sets he used, because they use different sample sizes and measures of seasonal adjustments. The national estimate is independent of state estimates, and the BLS warns against aggregating state data or using state data to compare with national data.\n\nIf the state is seeing huge job growth and getting far more of its population to work, that\u2019s a \u201cmuch better scene,\u201d Shierholz said. But despite being a \u201chuge state,\u201d Texas is \u201cnot necessarily \u2026 seeing a booming economy,\u201d she said, noting that the employment-to-population ratio in Texas is still below what it was before the recession.\n\nTexas\u2019s employment grew at a higher rate than nationally \u2014 by 24.5 percent. The national growth was 7.1 percent. So Texas made up a quarter of the jobs in America over 14 years, and it\u2019s a disproportionate growth compared to its population growth or to other states. But when you consider that Texas also added 13.5 percent of the U.S. population over that time period, it puts the employment numbers in perspective.\n\nMany unique factors affect Texas\u2019s job growth. For example, Texas is not only one of the largest states, but it also has one of the largest immigrant populations. Texas\u2019s immigrant population grew by nearly 20 percent between 2000 and 2013. The Migration Policy Institute\u2019s analysis of Census data shows the foreign-born population in Texas grew from 2.9 million to 4.4 million. Immigrants who arrived during that time tend to be of working age, and they are an important factor in the state\u2019s employment growth.\n\nIf Perry is aiming to take credit for the new jobs, it\u2019s difficult to see how economic policy decisions by a governor would have contributed. The largest industry in Texas that saw job growth was service-providing jobs and professional and business services. Industries that are more likely to be affected by the decisions and influence of the state\u2019s top executive, such as manufacturing and mining and logging (which includes the energy sector), grew by far less.\n\nThe Fact Checker has frequently urged readers to be wary about job-creation claims, either at the state or national level, as so much of what happens in an economy is beyond a politician\u2019s control. The data are also subject to manipulation. So it\u2019s almost an automatic Pinocchio when a politician starts spouting these claims.\n\nPerry\u2019s calculation of Texas creating one-third of all American jobs adds up \u2014 using his particular formula. But it is not an accurate or comprehensive measure of comparing employment growth on a national scale; his figure comes from the highest end of the calculation possible. Texas\u2019s population grew during this time, including working-age immigrants. A more comprehensive measure that accounts for this population growth shows that about a quarter of new employment in America was created in Texas.\n\nThere are plenty of other ways to portray Texas\u2019s job growth without using the one-third figure. One-quarter of American jobs is nothing to sneeze at. Dallas saw the largest job growth among large metropolitan areas in 2014. Texas ranks in the top five among states with the biggest percentage increases in jobs. Yet Perry continues to use a misleading figure \u2014 and thus receives Two Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
