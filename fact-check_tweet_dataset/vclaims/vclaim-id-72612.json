Sheila Jackson Lee can be a firecracker of a public speaker.\n\nBut we were skeptical of a and brought to our attention by a reader. The meme showed Jackson Lee, a Houstonian initially elected to the House in 1994, saying: \"Hey, all you wrinkly, white-aged has-beens: It\u2019s time for you to die and let the next generation have your spot on the planet.\"\n\nA web search led us to similar though less racially charged language posted by Stand Up for the Truth , a Wisconsin-based weekday religious public affairs program, in a November 2012 critical of the United Nations. The post opened: \"Hey all you wrinkly, middle-aged has-beens: Are you ready to move over and let the next generation have your spot on the planet? After all, you\u2019ve lived a good life. And your aging body is going to cost taxpayers a lot more than the salt you think you are worth.

Spokesman Mark Potok said not, otherwise pointing out a on the United Nations issue raised by Stand Up for Truth.\n\nWe also queried Michael McQuerry, a spokesman for Jackson Lee, who said by email: \"She has NEVER said this... This is someone who has taken her picture and placed these words on this. No truth to this at all.\" Asked if Jackson Lee had ever called for an individual or individuals to die, McQuerry replied: \"NO.\"\n\nThe Facebook meme says Jackson Lee called on \"all you wrinkly white-aged has-beens\" to die.\n\nNot so, nor has she said anything close. Pants on Fire!\n\nPANTS ON FIRE \u2013 The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.\n\nClick here for on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
