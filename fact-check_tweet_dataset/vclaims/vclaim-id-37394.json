It can by no means be concluded that he had gained weight.\n\nA report by Desh Gujarat on September 5th clarified that anomaly in the weight was due to a false reading. The article quotes the Superintendent of Sola Civil Hospital, Dr Desai as saying that \u201cyesterday the 58.3 i.e. the lower measurement must have been because of his wrong posture. If someone holds you or you take support of something during weighing your weight goes down drastically. This has happened with his weight.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
