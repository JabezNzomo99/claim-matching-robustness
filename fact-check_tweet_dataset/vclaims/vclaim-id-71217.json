She wondered why the \u2018pooja\u2019 has not stopped.Responding to a Twitter user, Joshi said that 50 sub-temples in Tirupati, that were still functioning, will also be closed now.Tirupati Temple shut on March 20, 2020, including the 50 sub-temples that Joshi falsely claimed were still running.We scanned the India Today report shared by Joshi. It says that the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) Board, which manages the hill abode of Lord Venkateswara, has announced lockdown till April 14, 2020. It makes no mention of the date this decision was made.\u201cOnce bustling with pilgrims coming from across the country, the Tirumala Tirupati temple now wears a deserted look. In view of the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19, the TTD board which manages the hill abode of Lord Venkateswara has announced lockdown till April 14. The board has also decided to continue the suspension of the Srivari (Lord) darshan at Srivari temple (main temple) for pilgrims till April 14. Earlier, TTD had imposed a total suspension of darshan for pilgrims in Tirumala temple till March 31. Apart from the main temple, 50 sub-temples under the administration of TTD have also been closed.\u201d states the report.Using \u2018Tirupati Temple Tirumala closed\u2019 as keywords, we found a Times of India news report dated March 19, 2020.Titled \u2018 Coronavirus scare: Tirumala temple to be closed for pilgrim worship, temple rituals will go on\u2019, the report mentions that Temple will be closed from March 20, 2020.\u2018The state government of Andhra Pradesh in consultation with the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) has collectively decided to close down the Tirumala temple for pilgrim worship for a week from Friday (March 20), in the wake of the sharp rise in the number of positive Covid-19 cases being reported across the country over the last few weeks,\u201d read the report.\u201cIn addition to the Tirumala temple, 50 sub-temples under the administrative purview of the TTD which are under the administrative control of the TTD, across the country, will also remain closed for pilgrim worship.\u201d the report mentions.We then found a news report dated March 25, 2020 from The News Minute, which mentioned that the deadline to shut the temple (after the review) has been further extended to March 31, 2020.Titled \u2018Tirumala Tirupati temple to be shut for devotees till March 31 as TTD extends closure\u2019, the report said that TTD on Tuesday (March 24, 2020) said that it was extending the closure of the temple for devotees until March 31, to help combat the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.After this, the closure deadline was further extended till April 14, 2020 in view of the national lockdown as mentioned earlier in India Today\u2019s report.All these reports prove that the Tirupati temple, including 50 sub-temples, have been shut since March 20, 2020. The ongoing Tablighi Jamaat fiasco has no bearing on this decision. Nor was the decision to shut temples taken \u201cquietly\u201d.Times Fact Check has found that news anchor Sakshi Joshi made a false claim of Tirupati temple closing after Tablighi Jamaat was \u201ctargeted\u201d. Her claim of 50 sub-temples in Tirupati being closed only from March 31, 2020 is also false.", "lang": "en"}
