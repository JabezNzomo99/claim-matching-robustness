Some 200,000 Filipinos abstained.\n\nThe plebiscite was held less than four months after the Constitutional Commission assembled by former president Aquino submitted the draft charter.\n\nThe 1986 provisional constitution directed the Commission to conduct public hearings to \u201cinsure that the people will have adequate participation in the formulation of the New Constitution\u201d and gave a 60-day period for a plebiscite after the draft charter submission.\n\nA proposed measure to revise the 1987 Constitution and shift the country\u2019s government from unitary to federal was approved by the House of Representatives Dec. 12.\n\nGadon, a lawyer of Speaker Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in her plunder case and one of her in-house counsels, is a vocal supporter of the government\u2019s federalism agenda.\n\nHe is also known for leading a petition to change the name of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport back to Manila International Airport, and for filing an impeachment complaint against former Supreme Court Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno.\n\nGadon currently faces disbarment cases, including for flipping the bird and hurling expletives at Sereno supporters during an April 2018 rally.\n\nHe is running under Kilusang Bagong Lipunan, a political party founded by late strongman Ferdinand Marcos Sr.\n\nUPDATE: Gadon in a Jan. 16 Facebook post responded to this fact check.
