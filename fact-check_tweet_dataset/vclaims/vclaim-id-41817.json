In other words, this virus cannot be defeated simply by staying inside for a couple of months,\u201d wrote Murdock, who said he was observing from the rear of the rally at a safe distance to gather material for a memoir. \u201cThe world will likely see periodic outbreaks, and we need to accept that and be prepared to deal with COVID long term.\u201d\n\nMurdock makes an array of points in the wide-ranging post, which has been shared more than 2,000 times. But we\u2019re especially interested in the claim about the longevity of COVID-19.\n\nOf course, the \u201cSafer at Home\u201d order from Gov. Tony Evers \u2013 and similar efforts across the country, including guidance from President Donald Trump \u2013 is not designed to eradicate the disease. It was implemented to slow the spread so hospitals aren\u2019t overwhelmed.\n\nUnderstanding that, we still wanted to examine the underlying claim.\n\nCOVID-19 has sickened 3 million and killed more than 200,000 globally. Is it really here to stay?\n\nClaim: COVID-19 is 'here to stay'\n\nMany experts have said a true return to normalcy likely isn\u2019t possible until a vaccine is widely available, which could be a year or more.\n\n\"We're going to probably all need to be used to social distancing for the next 12 to 18 months,\" John Raymond, CEO of the Medical College of Wisconsin, said during an April 27 online briefing for the Greater Milwaukee Committee. \u201cUntil hopefully we have an effective vaccine, it's likely we're going to be living with COVID-19.\u201d\n\nBut a vaccine doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the end of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cAbsent a vaccine, I think it would quite likely become like seasonal flu or perhaps like some of the other coronaviruses that we are familiar with,\u201d said Bill Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard University\u2019s School of Public Health. \u201cIt is entirely plausible that this could become part of our regular landscape of respiratory viraI infections.\u201d\n\nMore:How to tell the difference between coronavirus symptoms and allergies\n\nThe vaccine he references would be a theoretical one that is 100% effective and gives lifelong immunity. But vaccines are \u201calmost never perfect,\u201d notes Barry Bloom, a professor of public health at Harvard.\n\nBloom also expressed concern over the volume of misinformation about COVID-19 vaccinations on social media, which include a host of conspiracy theories about pushing people to vaccinate and concerns about how the vaccines may be dangerous. That could affect willingness to take a vaccine once it\u2019s available.\n\n\u201cThe vaccine is only a tool if it\u2019s used,\u201d Bloom said.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t know\n\nHanage said an array of key unknowns will determine the long-term future of COVID-19:\n\u2022 Whether people can get reinfected, and how severe those recurrences would be;\n\u2022 How much immunity results from minor infections;\n\u2022 How the summer warm-up alters infectiousness (based on both people\u2019s behavior and the reaction of the virus itself; generally, coronaviruses don\u2019t survive as long in warmer weather).\n\nEven if the virus does stick around, though, it may not be the threat it is today.\n\n\u201cIf that immunity is not very long-lasting \u2013 and we have good reason from other coronaviruses including the original SARS, that it won\u2019t be \u2013 what type of infections will people have when their immunity starts to wane?\u201d Hanage said. \u201cThe first thing to say is we don\u2019t know, but I think it\u2019s also plausible to suggest they might be milder.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that SARS \u2013 a disease caused by a coronavirus that killed 774 during a 2003 outbreak \u2013 has been eradicated. But there are key differences that make COVID-19 a more formidable foe.\n\nIn a March 5 article for The Lancet medical journal, Annelies Wilder-Smith noted COVID-19 can be passed on by those with minor symptoms or none at all; SARS patients generally weren\u2019t contagious until they had severe symptoms. And COVID-19 is more easily transmitted and has had a more prevalent community spread.\n\n\u201cThe virus remains, and we need to learn how to deal with it,\u201d said Wilder-Smith, a professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \u201cCertainly lockdown is only a temporary solution whilst we gear up to provide the true solution. Yes, we need to prepare for this reality.\u201d\n\nCharles Branas, chair of the epidemiology department at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health, said eradicating the virus like we did with smallpox \u201cwill be challenging, to say the least.\u201d Ali Khan, dean of the College of Public Health and professor of epidemiology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, said COVID-19 sticking around is \u201clikely, but not inevitable.\u201d\n\nKhan noted that some countries already are attempting to eliminate the virus. China, New Zealand, Australia and Vietnam have all set a goal of not just containment, but elimination. The New York Times reported April 24 that the adjoining nations of Australia and New Zealand are seeing just a handful of new infections each day and closing in on their \u201cextraordinary goal.\u201d\n\nBased on what we know now, we rate this claim as TRUE. Experts say it\u2019s still too early to know this with complete certainty, since much remains unknown about the nature of immunity. And we have no clue how effective a future vaccine may be. But a best guess at this point is that COVID-19 could indeed stick around long-term, waxing and waning similar to the seasonal flu. Experts say there\u2019s also reason to believe that lingering version could be less severe, though.\n\u2022 Conference call with Bill Hanage, associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard University\u2019s School of Public Health, April 29, 2020\n\u2022 Email exchange with Amy Kalkbrenner, associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, April 28, 2020\n\u2022 Email exchange with Ali Khan, dean of the College of Public Health and professor of epidemiology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, April 28, 2020\n\u2022 Email exchange with Annelies Wilder-Smith, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, April 28, 2020\n\u2022 Email exchange with Charles Branas, chair of the epidemiology department at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health, April 28, 2020\n\u2022 The Lancet, Can we contain the COVID-19 outbreak with the same measures as for SARS?, March 5, 2020\n\u2022 U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), Frequently Asked Questions, accessed April 28, 2020\n\u2022 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, A week after Evers unveiled a plan to reopen, there's little clarity on benchmarks like what metrics to monitor, April 27, 2020\n\u2022 Wausau Daily Herald, 'I'm guilty.
