The Mail linked the figure to a new \u201cblitz\u201d to help people with these problems to find work.\n\nThe figure is a rough estimate of the public cost of people who are homeless, offenders or drug misusers\u2014or any combination of the three. So it\u2019s not just about people with drug or alcohol problems. The start of the Mail\u2019s article alludes to this by referring to \u201cpeople with drink, drug and other problems\u201d.\n\nThe research it\u2019s based on describes the cost estimate as \u201c \u201d and says it should be taken as a guide. The researchers say it\u2019s likely to be a conservative estimate.\n\nThe \u00a310 billion is based on the of providing support such as benefits, support workers, substance treatment, hostels and other services; the cost of time in institutions such as prisons or psychiatric hospitals; the cost of NHS treatments; and other costs such as those to local authorities for rough sleeping.\n\nThe research behind this figure, published by the Lankelly Chase Foundation, sought to estimate the number of people experiencing \u201csevere and multiple disadvantage\u201d in England and how much they are costing public services. It severe and multiple disadvantage as people \u201cexperiencing\u201d at least one of the following: homelessness, offending and substance misuse.\n\nAround people were estimated to have come into contact with services for at least one of these three problems in England over the course of 2010/11. Of these, 364,000 experienced one, 164,000 experienced two and around 58,000 experienced all three.\n\nTime spent in the criminal justice system and in health services contribute to largest costs\n\nPublic expenditure on people with these severe and multiple disadvantages is around , according to the report.\n\nOne of our readers asked us whether this cost was counting only benefits spending. It isn\u2019t. Among the largest costs for these people is from the time they spend in the criminal justice system and in health services, the authors told us. The report doesn\u2019t offer a breakdown of areas of spending within the \u00a310 billion, though.\n\nIn terms of benefit-related expenditure, the figure counts spending on out-of-work benefits and housing benefit, but not on additional disability-related benefits. For the group with all three problems, nearly half having a limiting long term illness or disability.\n\nThe Work and Pensions Secretary is quoted in the article as saying that people with these problems have been \u201cwritten off to a life on benefits\u201d and that the government is seeking to put an end to this by offering them support to get into work. The authors of the research told us that seeking to reduce the number of problems these people face is a more realistic focus than seeking to get them into work.\n\nCost estimate is indicative and not definitive\n\nThe report gives why the cost estimate is a rough one.\n\nFor one, it says the survey data used to compile the cost estimates is focused on people with especially complex problems. This means they are likely to have higher costs. But it also says this group may have lower costs because more of them, such as those who are rough sleepers, aren\u2019t receiving the services they need. So this could push the figure up or down.\n\nSecondly, the researchers didn\u2019t have a record of each person\u2019s separate time in institutions or services over the space of one year. They\u2019ve had to combine data from different points in time to get an estimate of costs for those institutions and services over a one-year period.\n\nLastly, they state that the estimates for the cost of various services are \u201csomewhat crude, and do rest on a lot of assumptions\u201d.\n\nStill, the authors had reason to think that the \u00a310.1 billion estimate is a \u201c \u201d figure. For example, it doesn\u2019t include the costs of \u2018missed appointments\u2019 in the NHS which at least one other study found were significant.", "lang": "en"}
