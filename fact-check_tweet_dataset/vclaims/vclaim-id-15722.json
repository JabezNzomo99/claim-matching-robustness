CM Sachin Pilot visiting a confectionery shop. In the image, a poster can be seen on the glass wall at the entrance of the shop which reads, \u201c\u0930\u093e\u0939\u0941\u0932 \u0917\u093e\u0901\u0927\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0927\u093e\u0928\u092e\u0902\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u092c\u0928\u0928\u0947 \u0924\u0915 \u0909\u0927\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u092c\u0902\u0926 (No more lending to customers till the time Rahul Gandhi becomes the Prime Minister -translated)\u201d. The message attached to the image claims, \u201c\u092b\u094b\u091f\u094b \u0930\u094b\u0921 \u0936\u094b \u0915\u0947 \u0926\u094c\u0930\u093e\u0928 \u0932\u0940 \u0917\u092f\u0940 \u0939\u0948! (This photo was clicked during a roadshow)\u201d. The post suggests that this picture was clicked at a recent Rahul Gandhi roadshow where the shop had a such a poster. It is an attempt to mock and suggest that Rahul Gandhi is not going to become the Prime Minister in the foreseeable future.\n\nMany other individuals on Twitter and Facebook have shared this image with an identical narrative. A post by Facebook page, Mission Modi, has also garnered more than 500 shares.\n\nAlt News found that the original poster in the shop was digitally superimposed with another poster. A simple reverse search on Google led us to the original image, which features a poster enlisting items available at the store. According to the tweet below, Rahul Gandhi had stopped at a famous confectionery in Bikaner on his way to the Airport from a rally.\n\nThe poster that was digitally superimposed on the original image is posted below.\n\nABP News had earlier fact-checked this in 2018 when it went viral in the run-up to the Rajasthan assembly elections.\n\nWith the four more phases of elections to go, the misinformation on social media is expected to amplify. Social media users are advised to avoid sharing any potential misinformation without cross-checking it.", "lang": "en"}
