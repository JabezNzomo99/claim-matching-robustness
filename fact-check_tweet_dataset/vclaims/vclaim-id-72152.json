Unfortunately, what emerged was the verbal equivalent of mixed martial arts as one would interrupt the other, and the preferred rhetorical device seemed to be talking louder and louder. (We also checked Schultz's claim about 10.3 million people benefiting from Obamacare.)\n\nIn the course of the melee, Loesch delivered a salient criticism about the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"4.7 million people have lost their insurance in 32 states,\" Loesch said.\n\nWe reached out to Loesch to find the source of that claim and did not hear back. However, it matches a list compiled by the in December 2013. It represents a tally from AP staffers and calculates a low-end figure of how many Americans received insurance cancellation notifications. (Not every state was able to provide a figure, hence Loesch isolating on 32 states.)\n\nYou likely remember stories about the cancellation notices, which were the result of individual insurance plans not meeting the minimum standards of the new health care law. PolitiFact\u2019s 2013 Lie of the Year was a claim by President Barack Obama that \"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it.\"\n\nSince that chaotic time, however, some clearer data has emerged. While the AP said that millions of people had received cancellation letters, there are reasons to doubt the numbers in certain states. For example, the list said 333,000 notices went out to Blue Cross/Blue Shield customers in Florida. But as reported by , a company spokesman said it mailed only 44,000 cancellations letters.\n\nThe AP said 290,000 cancellations letters were sent in Washington state. A few weeks later, the state\u2019s called that \"inaccurate.\"\n\nAnalysts at the explored the discrepancies in a survey conducted the same month as the AP published its list. When they asked people with individual insurance, they found that about 20 percent said the plan they had in 2013 would no longer be offered.\n\nBased on this survey, the analysts estimated that about 2.6 million people had lost their existing plans due to the minimum standards set by Obamacare.\n\nBut the institute analysts also noted that a great deal of churning always takes place in the individual market. They found that less than 20 percent of the customers ever kept a plan for more than two years. This fits with the experience of another health care researcher, Christine Eibner with the RAND Corporation.\n\n\"It appears that the number of people that lost coverage from 2013 to 2014 is similar or less than the number of people who lost coverage in previous years,\" Eibner told PunditFact.\n\nSo, while the Affordable Care Act\u2019s standards played a role, some people would have changed, dropped or altered coverage anyway.\n\nMoreover, the AP figure fails to factor in that due to the outcry in November 2013, Obama gave states the option to allow people to keep their existing plans, if insurers agreed.\n\nIn Florida, the 44,000 people who did get a cancellation letter later received a second one that said they could keep those policies for another year, if they wanted.\n\nIn fact, the key problem with Loesch\u2019s statement is that she said these people \"have lost their insurance,\" as if none of them replaced one plan with another.\n\nA study published by painted a very different picture. Of an estimated 9.4 million people with individual insurance, fewer than 1 million ended up without any coverage at all. Over half of the original group bought another policy in the individual market. About 2 million took coverage offered through an employer, and a bit under a million found a plan through one of the government\u2019s online insurance marketplaces.\n\nFinally, we should note that while some people have lost insurance since most of the main elements of Obamacare took effect, the net impact has been a boost in the ranks of the insured. An estimated 10.3 million more people have insurance today than did right before October 2013.\n\nLoesch said that 4.7 million people have lost their health insurance due to Obamacare. That number matches one cited by the Associated Press based on preliminary estimates and incomplete data. The best estimate from independent researchers is that perhaps 2.6 million people received notices that their health care insurance policies were being canceled.\n\nHowever, Loesch spoke as if these people, whatever their number, did not find replacement coverage. In reality, fewer than 1 million people who had been part of the individual insurance market ended up with no coverage at all. Given the constant churn in that market, it is unlikely that the Affordable Care Act caused all of them to be without health insurance.\n\nLoesch\u2019s number is off, both in terms of the cancellations and what people did afterward. Still, the new law did hurt some people.\n\nWe rate the claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
