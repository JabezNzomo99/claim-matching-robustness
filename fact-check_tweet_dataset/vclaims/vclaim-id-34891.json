No, that's not true: This is a click-bait claim that misrepresents the conclusions of a study about the affects of emotional stories on the brain's chemistry in the brain, which then makes people more willing to donate to charities. The research did not measure the strength of people who cry during movies.\n\nThe claim originated from an article (archived here) where published by awarenessact.com on November 28, 2019 under the title \"The People Who Cry During Movies Are The Strongest People Of All\". It opened:\n\nThis is what social media users saw:\n\nNeuroeconomist Paul J. Zak's study \"Why Inspiring Stories Make Us React: The Neuroscience of Narrative\" is a real study and we read every word. It was fascinating. But it had nothing to do with the amount of tears you might shed while watching Bambi's mother die in a theater. It does take a scientific look at how your brain reacts to emotional narratives. The editor's note described it this way:\n\nThe man behind the discovery of the behavioral effect of a neurochemical in the brain called oxytocin wondered if the molecule might motivate people to engage in cooperative behaviors. In a series of tests using videos, his lab discovered that compelling narratives cause oxytocin release and have the power to affect our attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors.\n\nIt did not measure a person's strength by their tears. The publisher of this story either did not actually read the story, or decided it was acceptable to misrepresent the study so that the website could make money off of your clicking. This is what we call click bait.", "lang": "en"}
