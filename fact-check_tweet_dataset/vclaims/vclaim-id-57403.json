Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nFact: NSA Ajit Doval does not have an official handle on any of the social media platforms. Screenshot in the post is from a fan page of Ajit Doval. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn searching for the official handle of NSA Ajit Doval on Facebook, we found that NSA Ajit Doval does not have any official account on Facebook. Not only on Facebook, but Ajit Doval also does not have an official account on any of the social media platforms. Screenshot in the post is from a fan page of Ajit Doval.\n\nWe found several fan pages in the name of NSA Ajit Doval. When we searched for this screenshot in fan pages, we came across the fan account that posted Independence day wishes with the Egyptian flag. We do not see the Egypt flag in the post now, but the edit history of this post shows that the wishes were first posted with an emoji of the Egypt flag.\n\nTo sum it up, screenshot of a fan page post is falsely shared alleging NSA Ajit Doval posted Independence Day wishes with the Egyptian flag.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
