The claim is false; the video was filmed at a different temple more than 130 miles away.\n\nThe video was shared in this Facebook post on May 29, 2019, where it has been viewed more than 213,000 times and shared more than 3,100 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe one-minute, 39-second video shows a man dressed in Muslim attire facing a Sikh man who is sitting on a stage. The man in Muslim attire kneels and bows his head several times in prayer towards the stage.\n\nThe Malaysian-language caption translates to English as: \u201cThis video was taken at gurdwara sahib temple, Johor Bahru. If this man is Muslim, which Islamic school of thought does he belong to? Islamic prayers but no rukuk (a bowing gesture while praying). \n\n Congratulations MP Johor Bahru, may your reckoning be easy.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohor Baru\u201d refers to a city in south Malaysia. \u201cGurdwara Sahib temple, Johor Bahru\u201d refers to a Sikh temple listed on Google Maps here. A photo of its prayer hall can be seen here.\n\nThe misleading post was shared a day after Johor Bahru lawmaker Akmal Nasir was criticized after he attended an interfaith iftar, or fast-breaking meal, at the Gurdwara Sahib in Johor Baru on the evening of May 28, 2019, during Ramadan.\n\nThis report about the incident was published by Malaysian news site Malaysiakini on May 28, 2019.\n\nThe first paragraph of the report says: \u201cJohor Bahru MP Akmal Nasir has defended his breaking fast programme to be held at a gudwara (Sikh temple) in the state this evening.\u201d\n\nThe video was also shared on here and here on Facebook with a similar claim, and on YouTube here with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the video was actually filmed at a different temple more than 130 miles away and posted days before the controversy was sparked over the lawmaker\u2019s actions.\n\nThe same video was published in this Facebook post on May 25, 2019, before the interfaith iftar event which lawmaker Akmal attended on May 28.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading posts (L) and the same video shared on Facebook on May 25, 2019 (R):\n\nThe caption for the Facebook post published on May 25, 2019, states: \u201cGod Is One.. A Muslim Man Performing His Prayers In Gurdwara Sahib Melaka Darbar Sahib.. Sabna Jiya Ka Ek Data..\n\n #Saturday25052019\u201d.\n\n\u201cDarbar Sahib\u201d refers to the stage where the holy book is placed, while \u201cSabna Jiya Ka Ek Data\u201d translates from Punjabi to English as: \u201cThere is only the One, the Giver of all souls.\u201d\n\nThe caption states the video shows a Muslim man praying at the Gurdwara Sahib Melaka on May 25, 2019.\n\nHere is the Gurdwara Sahib Melaka in the city of Malacca on Google Maps.\n\nThis Google user\u2019s image tagged at the location on Google Maps in November 2018 shows a corresponding interior to the temple seen in the misleading Facebook post.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the image:\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading post (L) and the Google image (R):\n\nThe Gurdwara Sahib Melaka is 222 km (138 miles) from the Gurdwara Sahib Johor Bahru, according to Google Maps.", "lang": "en"}
