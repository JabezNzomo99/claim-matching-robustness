However, a reverse image search reveals the picture was in fact taken two years ago.\n\nThe post attracted more than 3000 reactions when shared on this Facebook group which has over 1.9 million followers according to CrowdTangle data.\n\nThe misleading post claimed that Tukongole undertook her primary school national exam this year aged 71 and scored an impressive 320 marks out of the possible 500 marks (equivalent to 64 percent).\n\nHowever, a reverse image search on Google and Yandex search engines revealed that the photograph was first published in 2016 and taken by photojournalist Joseph Kipsang, who works for the Standard newspaper.\n\nKipsang told AFP that he had spotted his old photograph going viral in recent days and was taken aback as he originally published Tukongole\u2019s story two years ago when the grandmother of 15 undertook her national exams, aged 71.\n\n\u201cI have seen the photo circulating on social media and I think it is fake news because I am the one who did the story back in 2016,\u201d Kipsang said.\n\nWilson Loliet, a former headteacher at Chepturu primary school in Baringo, confirmed to AFP that Tukongole had been a student there and had undertaken her national exams in 2016, but added she scored a less impressive 142 (or 28 percent).\n\n\u201cShe was a midwife and a circumciser, but when she joined school she stopped performing female genital mutilation. Her desire was to venture in the field of medicine but after finishing her primary school education she did not have the money to continue with her education,\u201d Loliet said.\n\nTukongole studied for nine years before finally sitting for her national exams.\n\n\u201cShe is now able to translate the Bible at her church which was also one of her motivations to join school despite her age,\u201d Loliet added.", "lang": "en"}
