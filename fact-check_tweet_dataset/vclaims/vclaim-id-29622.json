Bernie Sanders claims Wall Street firms received $1 trillion during the financial crisis. We check his math and find it exaggerated.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2019-03-18T07:00:39.235Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-29622", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/18/did-wall-street-get-trillion-dollar-bailout-during-financial-crisis/?utm_term=.0a8e81d27e36", "vclaim": "We won\u2019t try to debate whether Serageldin was a \u201cmajor\u201d executive. Sanders\u2019s larger point is valid: According to the New York Times, almost 900 executives went to jail for the savings and loan scandal in the 1980s, compared with just one person in the 2008 financial crisis. Even the judge who sentenced Serageldin to 30 months in prison was troubled that his conduct was just \u201ca small piece of an overall evil climate within the bank and with many other banks.\u201d\n\nBut we can take a more expansive definition and say every bank counts as Wall Street. So that\u2019s $245 billion. We can also include the U.S. government takeover of mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ($191 billion), which help keep the housing market functioning. We could also add the U.S. government\u2019s purchase of much of American International Group ($67.8 billion), an insurance company central to many financial transactions, such as credit default swaps.\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that while financial institutions were bailed out, so were the American people. If these banks and other financial institutions had collapsed, many companies would have soon followed, leading to massive layoffs. The collapse of AIG would have had global impact. Moreover, in the case of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG, shareholders were basically wiped out when the government took them over, so it\u2019s not as if the owners of all of the companies that received TARP funds or other government aid were \u201cbailed out.\u201d\n\nThe wide range of these estimates suggests that they should be viewed with skepticism. The Federal Reserve at the time said the reports were \u201cwildly inaccurate.\u201d One problem is that the calculations appear to count every loan as a new loan, even if it was simply rolled over to a new period. One of the reports on the Federal Reserve that Jones shared, from the Government Accountability Office in 2011, stated: \u201cLoans outstanding for the emergency programs peaked at more than $1 trillion in late 2008.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the Fed remits its excess profits to the U.S. Treasury, so all of the gains from the New York Fed\u2019s extraordinary facilities were paid to the U.S. government. Our colleague Allan Sloan has estimated that the Fed earned $132 billion in profit from 2007 to 2012 on the special lending facilities, which it, in turn, delivered to the U.S. government.\n\n\u201cAs far as Federal Reserve lending is concerned, I do not see how you can call it a bailout when loans were repaid with a profit,\u201d said James D. Hamilton, professor of economics at the University of California at San Diego. He said the cumulative total net gains to the U.S. Treasury from Federal Reserve operations from the first quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2017 came to $819 billion.\n\nNot only was Wall Street bailed out, but also the whole U.S. economy \u2014 at a profit of more than $200 billion for U.S. taxpayers. That point is frequently lost in the political discussion over whether the bailouts were worthwhile. We presume Sanders is not suggesting that the U.S. government should not have taken extraordinary actions to stabilize the financial markets.", "lang": "en"}
