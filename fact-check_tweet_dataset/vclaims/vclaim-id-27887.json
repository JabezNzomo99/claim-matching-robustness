The 12-month deficit is up 20 percent under his presidency.\n\u2022 Trump wrongly claimed he convinced South Korea to increase its shared cost of the U.S. military presence in South Korea from $500 million to $900 million a year. South Korea was already paying well over $800 million a year under a five-year agreement that expired in December, and it reached a tentative agreement to increase its contribution by 8.2 percent.\n\u2022 Pushing back on fact-checkers and others who cited FBI data to debunk his claim that a fence transformed El Paso into one of the safest cities, Trump said crime data was recorded differently and that there was an attempt to \u201cpull the wool over everybody\u2019s eyes.\u201d But there is no evidence of doctored data.\n\u2022 The president noted there were 1,200 murders last year in the Mexican city of Juarez, compared with 23 just across the border in El Paso. But despite drug-related murder rates across the border, the number of murders in El Paso has long been relatively low.\n\u2022 Trump also repeated several claims we\u2019ve debunked before on job growth, Veterans Affairs legislation, the \u201cright to try\u201d law and a Virginia abortion bill.\n\nThe president held a campaign rally in El Paso to again make his case for a border wall, as members of Congress debated a border security and spending bill to avoid another government shutdown. Both chambers are expected to vote on a measure today.\n\nTrump again repeated false claims about crime in El Paso before and after a border fence was built, adding some new twists to his talking points. But he also made misleading and false statements about the trade deficit and an agreement with South Korea on its contribution to the U.S. military presence there.\n\nThe president left the false impression that the trade deficit had declined thanks to his efforts. In fact, the trade deficit has gone up under Trump.\n\nThat\u2019s some serious spin. The trade deficit did go down in November, the most recent data available, but that came after the monthly deficit reached the highest point in 10 full years in October.\n\nTrump said he hasn\u2019t \u201cbeen here very long\u201d and yet the deficit dropped \u201clast month.\u201d His audience cheered as he told them, \u201cThat\u2019s what I do.\u201d But the trade deficit has gone up in his two years in office. It\u2019s up 20.3 percent for the 12 months ending in November, compared with 2016, the year before he took office.\n\nEven if the president wanted to focus solely on the November monthly figure, that too is up from November 2017, and 2016.\n\nThese figures come from the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis. Its most recent report, released Feb. 6, said the November monthly goods and services trade deficit had dropped by $6.4 billion compared with October. However, it noted, \u201cYear-to-date, the goods and services deficit increased $51.9 billion, or 10.4 percent, from the same period in 2017.\u201d\n\nAnd 2017\u2019s annual trade deficit ($552.3 billion) was up 10 percent from 2016 ($502 billion). So far, the trade deficit for the first 11 months of 2018 is just below the full 2017 figure \u2014 by a mere $13 million.\n\nHistorical numbers from BEA show that the 2017 trade deficit was the highest since 2008, just edging out 2011, and 2018\u2019s figure will easily top that.\n\nTrump suggested that, prior to 2019, South Korea was paying \u201c$500 million a year\u201d under a cost-sharing deal that helps fund American military forces in that country. That\u2019s wrong.\n\nOn Feb. 10, South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that it had agreed (pending approval by its legislature) to contribute 1.039 trillion Korean won (or about $924 million in U.S. dollars) in 2019 as part of a new one-year \u201cSpecial Measures Agreement\u201d that helps to offset the cost of maintaining a U.S. military presence in South Korea.\n\nBut the press release noted that was only an 8.2 percent increase from what South Korea paid in 2018 (which would have been 960 billion won) under a previous five-year deal approved in 2014 that expired at the end of last year. That earlier deal, which went into force in June 2014, called for South Korea to contribute 920 billion won in 2014 and then increase its annual payments at the rate of inflation. That worked out to \u201capproximately $830 million per year,\u201d according to Trump\u2019s own State Department.\n\nEven the five-year deal before that one \u2014 agreed to in 2009 \u2014 had South Korea committing to contribute much more than $500 million a year. As the State Department said on Jan. 15, 2009: \u201cIn the agreement signed in Seoul today, the [Republic of Korea] will provide 760 billion won (approximately U.S. $691.5 million based on the 2008 average exchange rate) in 2009 and will increase the funding level in the subsequent years by the rise in the Consumer Price Index, with a maximum four-percent annual cap.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration reportedly requested that South Korea increase its contribution for 2019 to as much as $1.6 billion, but South Korea would not agree to do so.\n\nIn its \u201cStrategic Digest\u201d report for 2018, U.S. Forces Korea said that \u201cSouth Korea reinforces the Alliance by funding approximately 41 percent of the day-to-day non-personnel stationing costs for USFK.\u201d If its 2018 contribution of over $800 million was less than half of those costs, that suggests the Trump administration was seeking to have South Korea pay close to all of the non-personnel costs of hosting the U.S. military.\n\nIn his visit to El Paso, the president doubled down on his false State of the Union claim that a border fence transformed the Texas city from one of the most dangerous cities in the country to one of the safest.\n\u2022 Fact-checkers and other media cited FBI crime statistics to refute his claim about El Paso\u2019s violent crime rate, but Trump made the baseless suggestion that crime statistics had been doctored.\n\u2022 To back up his claim that \u201cwalls work,\u201d Trump noted that there were 1,200 murders last year in the Mexican city of Juarez, compared with 23 just across the border in El Paso. But the number of murders in El Paso has long been relatively low compared with other big cities, and has historically been far lower than in Juarez, even before the fence.\n\nWe first wrote about the president\u2019s bogus crime claims about El Paso when, during a speech in Louisiana on Jan. 14, he claimed El Paso went from \u201cone of the most dangerous cities in the country to one of the safest cities in the country overnight\u201d after \u201ca wall was put up\u201d along the Mexico border.\n\nAs we wrote then, El Paso has never been \u201cone of the most dangerous cities in the country.\u201d The city had the third lowest violent crime rate among 35 U.S. cities with a population over 500,000 in 2005, 2006 and 2007 \u2013 before construction of 57 miles of fencing started in the El Paso sector in mid-2008. Nor was there an \u201covernight\u201d drop in violent crime in El Paso after \u201ca wall was put up.\u201d In fact, the city\u2019s violent crime rate increased 5.5 percent from 2007 to 2010 \u2014 the years before and after construction of the fence, which was completed in mid-2009. Those years were not anomalies. The violent crime rate increased about 9.6 percent between 2006 and 2011 \u2014 two years before the fence construction began and two years after it was finished.\n\nAlong with the rest of the country, El Paso\u2019s violent crime rate spiked in the early 1990s and has been trending downward ever since. The city\u2019s violent crime rate dropped 62 percent from its peak in 1993 to 2007, a year before construction on the fence began. We pointed out the same facts when the president repeated the false talking point in his State of the Union address.\n\nAt his rally in El Paso, Trump again took aim at media outlets, and the Republican mayor of El Paso, for noting that FBI crime statistics directly contradicted the president\u2019s earlier claims.\n\nThis time, however, the president argued the FBI data had been manipulated, masking the crime-reducing effectiveness of the fence.\n\n\u201cTake a look at what they did with their past crimes and how they made them from very serious to much lesser,\u201d the president said. Later, he said people ought to \u201clook at how they recorded those past crimes, it went way, way down,\u201d adding that there was an attempt to \u201cpull the wool over everybody\u2019s eyes.\u201d\n\nTrump, Feb. 11: And I\u2019ve been watching where they\u2019ve been trying to say, \u201cOh, the wall didn\u2019t make that much \u2013\u201d Well you take a look at what they did with their past crimes and how they made them from very serious to much lesser, you take a look at what the real system is. \u2026 And I don\u2019t care whether a mayor is a Republican or a Democrat, they\u2019re full of crap when they say it hasn\u2019t made a big difference. I heard the same thing from the fake news. They said, \u201cOh, crime actually stayed the same.\u201d It didn\u2019t stay the same, it went way down. And look at what they did to their past crimes and look at how they recorded those past crimes, it went way, way down. These people, you know, you\u2019d think they\u2019d want to get to the bottom of a problem and solve a problem, not try and pull the wool over everybody\u2019s eyes. So for those few people that are out there on television saying, \u201cOh, it didn\u2019t make too much of a difference,\u201d it made a tre\u2013 people from El Paso, am I right?\n\nTrump did not say who changed the way crime data was recorded, and he provided no evidence that it had changed. The El Paso police department also did not respond to our inquiries. But El Paso County Commissioner Carlos Leon, who served as the El Paso police chief for five years until 2003, called the president\u2019s allegation \u201cinsulting.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe made it seem like the numbers were doctored,\u201d Leon said. \u201cThe numbers are black and white. That\u2019s the way it was. \u2026 For the president to say the mayor and others are full of crap, that\u2019s insulting. The numbers are what the numbers are. There is no such thing as doctoring those numbers.\u201d\n\nAnd the numbers, he said, show that El Paso has long been a relatively safe city and that there was not a sharp decline in violent crime immediately after the fence went up.\n\nOver the years, there have been changes to the Uniform Crime Reporting system that the FBI uses to collect crime data. For example, hate crime was added in 1990 and human-trafficking in 2013, and the definition of rape changed in 2013, according to the FBI.\n\nBut we found no evidence of any attempt by city, state or federal law enforcement officials to intentionally deceive the public by misreporting the city\u2019s crime data, as Trump suggested.\n\nRather than repeating his claim that El Paso was once one of the most dangerous cities in the country \u2014 it has never been \u2014 the president changed his talking point, comparing the number of murders in Juarez, Mexico, just across the border, with El Paso as evidence that \u201cwalls work.\u201d\n\nTrump was roughly correct when he noted that in 2018, Juarez recorded 1,200 murders (actually 1,247, according to El Diario), and El Paso police reported 23 murders.\n\nBut that\u2019s not evidence a border fence has kept homicides in Juarez from spilling into El Paso, as Trump suggests. The number of murders in Juarez has far outpaced those in the much smaller city of El Paso both before and after the fence.\n\nIn 2007, there were 336 homicides in Juarez compared with 17 in the city of El Paso. Construction of the fence started in mid-2008. That year, a war between drug cartels in Juarez sent the number of homicides in the Mexican city soaring to 2,570. Yet across the border in the city of El Paso, there were 17 homicides, according to the FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting Program.\n\nIn 2010, the year after the fence was completed, the number of homicides dropped to 5 in El Paso, before climbing back up to 16 in 2011 and 23 in 2012. Most recently, the city of El Paso recorded 17 homicides in 2016 and 19 in 2017. Those figures are in line with those before the fence went up. The city averaged 15.2 homicides a year in the five years between 2003 and 2007.\n\nBecause of changing population, it\u2019s better to look at the rate, rather than the raw number, to gauge crime. The murder rate in the city of El Paso was 2.5 in 2016 and 2.8 in 2017, about where it was before the fence. From 2003 to 2007, the murder rate averaged about 2.5 per 100,000 residents per year.\n\n\u201cIt has always been a different story right next door in Juarez,\u201d Leon said.\n\nAs usual, the president repeated some of his debunked claims.\n\nHere are a few of them:\n\u2022 Virginia Abortion Law: As he did in his State of the Union, Trump mischaracterized Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s remarks about a state bill that would loosen restrictions on late-term abortions. \u201cThe governor stated that he would even allow a newborn baby to come out into the world and wrap the baby and make the baby comfortable. And then talk to the mother and talk to the father and then execute the baby,\u201d Trump said to a chorus of boos. That\u2019s not what Northam said. In a radio interview , Northam, who is a physician, said third-trimester abortion is \u201cdone in cases where there may be severe deformities. There may be a fetus that\u2019s nonviable. So in this particular example, if a mother\u2019s in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if that\u2019s what the mother and the family desired. And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.\u201d A spokeswoman for Northam later said he was \u201c absolutely not \u201d talking about infanticide.\n\u2022 Job Growth: The president also, once again, said, \u201cSince the election, we have created 5.3 million new jobs, including more than a half a million new manufacturing jobs.\u201d In fact, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show the economy has added just under 4.9 million jobs since January 2017, when he took office \u2014 not 5.3 million. And the economy added 454,000 manufacturing jobs during Trump\u2019s tenure \u2014 not more than 500,000.\n\u2022 VA Choice and VA Accountability: Trump continued to wrongly claim that it took \u201c40 years\u201d before he signed legislation creating \u201cVeterans Choice,\u201d and that before he signed a VA accountability bill, \u201cwe couldn\u2019t fire anybody from the Veterans Administration\u201d for treating \u201cour veterans badly.\u201d The Veterans Choice Program was created by the bipartisan Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act that President Barack Obama signed in August 2014. It allowed veterans with long wait times or travel burdens to get care from eligible health care providers outside the Veterans Affairs system. Since Trump took office, he has continued the program, signing legislation to provide funding for the program and to eliminate the expiration date.\n\n Also, it was possible for VA employees to be fired before Trump signed the Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act in June 2017. That law does make it easier for the VA secretary to remove employees by shortening the firing process and expediting the appeals process for senior executives, among other things. But the VA was already terminating about 2,300 employees (for performance and disciplinary reasons) each fiscal year on average before Trump\u2019s presidency going back to 2005.\n\u2022 Right to Try: The president wrongly said there was \u201cnothing\u201d terminally ill patients could do in the United States to access unapproved drugs until he signed the \u201cright to try\u201d law in late May. \u201c[I]f somebody was terminally ill they traveled to Asia, they traveled to Europe, they\u2019d travel all over the world, if they had the money. If they didn\u2019t have the money, they\u2019d just go home, there was nothing they could do,\u201d he said. But the FDA for years has approved applications from patients seeking access to investigational drugs through the agency\u2019s \u201cexpanded access\u201d program. FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb told Congress in 2017 that the FDA had approved 99 percent of the more than 1,000 annual applications it gets under that program. The right to try legislation aims to bypass the FDA and give terminally ill patients access to unapproved drugs more quickly. We wrote about this issue last fall, when the president made a similar claim.\n\nBureau of Economic Analysis. \u201cU.S. International Trade in Goods and Services, November 2018.\u201d 6 Feb 2019.\n\nBureau of Economic Analysis.
