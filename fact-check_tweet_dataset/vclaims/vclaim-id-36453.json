In 1971 a woman could not: 1. Get a Credit Card in her own name \u2013 it wasn\u2019t until 1974 that a law forced credit card companies to issue cards to women without their husband\u2019s signature. 2. Be guaranteed that they wouldn\u2019t be unceremoniously fired for the offense of getting pregnant \u2013 that changed with the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of *1978*! 3. Serve on a jury \u2013 It varied by state (Utah deemed women fit for jury duty way back in 1879), but the main reason women were kept out of jury pools was that they were considered the center of the home, which was their primary responsibility as caregivers. They were also thought to be too fragile to hear the grisly details of crimes and too sympathetic by nature to be able to remain objective about those accused of offenses. In 1961, the Supreme Court unanimously upheld a Florida law that exempted women from serving on juries. It wasn\u2019t until 1973 that women could serve on juries in all 50 states. 4. Fight on the front lines \u2013 admitted into military academies in 1976 it wasn\u2019t until 2013 that the military ban on women in combat was lifted. Prior to 1973 women were only allowed in the military as nurses or support staff. 5. Get an Ivy League education \u2013 Yale and Princeton didn\u2019t accept female students until 1969. Harvard didn\u2019t admit women until 1977 (when it merged with the all-female Radcliffe College). Brown (which merged with women\u2019s college Pembroke), Dartmouth and Columbia did not offer admission to women until 1971, 1972 and 1981, respectively. Other case-specific instances allowed some women to take certain classes at Ivy League institutions (such as Barnard women taking classes at Columbia), but, by and large, women in the \u201960s who harbored Ivy League dreams had to put them on hold. 6. Take legal action against workplace sexual harassment. Indeed the first time a court recognized office sexual harassment as grounds for any legal action was in 1977! 7. Decide not to have sex if their husband wanted to \u2013 spousal rape wasn\u2019t criminalized in all 50 states until 1993. Read that again \u2026 1993. 8. Obtain health insurance at the same monetary rate as a man. Sex discrimination wasn\u2019t outlawed in health insurance until 2010 and today many, including sitting elected officials at the Federal level, feel women don\u2019t mind paying a little more. Again, that date was 2010. 9. The birth control pill: Issues like reproductive freedom and a woman\u2019s right to decide when and whether to have children were only just beginning to be openly discussed in the 1960s. In 1957, the FDA approved of the birth control pill but only for \u201csevere menstrual distress.\u201d In 1960, the pill was approved for use as a contraceptive. Even so, the pill was illegal in some states and could be prescribed only to married women for purposes of family planning, and not all pharmacies stocked it. Some of those opposed said oral contraceptives were \u201cimmoral, promoted prostitution and were tantamount to abortion.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until several years later that birth control was approved for use by all women, regardless of marital status. In short, birth control meant a woman could complete her education, enter the work force and plan her own life. Oh, and one more thing, prior to 1880 which is just a few years before the photo of this very proud lady was taken, the age of consent for sex was set at 10 or 12 in more states, with the exception of our neighbor Delaware \u2013 where it was 7 YEARS OLD! Feminism is NOT just for other women.\n\nA similar post on Facebook with tens of thousands of shares reported much the same in 2016 from user Lisa Bialac-Jehle.\n\nIn general, the list above accurately reports nine things that women couldn\u2019t do in 1971. We\u2019ll take a closer look at each item below:\n\nGet a credit card in her own name\n\nAs this post explains, banks were able to discriminate against women applying for credit cards until the passage of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act in October 1974. Women could get credit cards prior to this legislation, but as The Smithsonian notes, they were likely to be asked a barrage of personal questions and were often required to be accompanied by a man to co-sign for a credit card. Even then, women often received cards with lower limits or higher rates:\n\nBe guaranteed that they wouldn\u2019t be unceremoniously fired for getting pregnant\n\nWomen faced a number of work-related consequences for getting pregnant prior to the passage of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978. On the 40th anniversary of this law, the ACLU posted a statement explaining how pregnancy often resulted in pink slips for working women:\n\nWomen\u2019s road to the jury box was a long one. While the state of Utah deemed women qualified for jury duty back in 1898, it took the other 49 states several decades to reach the same conclusion. The ACLU noted that women were excluded from jury duties for a number of reasons:\n\nWhile this viral posts states that it wasn\u2019t until \u201c1973 that women could serve on juries in all 50 states,\u201d we found that this battle was still being fought for at least another two years. In 1975, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in an 8-1 decision that it was constitutionally unacceptable for states to bar women from juries.\n\nFrom a 1975 article in The New York Times:\n\nWomen in the United States have been aiding military operations as nurses, cooks, and in other non-combat positions since the Revolutionary War in 1775. However, it wasn\u2019t until 1976 that the United States Military Academy at West Point accepted women to the Corps of Cadets.\n\nStill, it would be several more years until women would find their way to the front lines. In 1994, the Pentagon restricted women from serving in \u201cartillery, armor, infantry and other such combat roles.\u201d This ban wasn\u2019t lifted until 2013:\n\nThe Ivy League is comprised of eight universities in the northeastern part of the United States. While women were able to attend Cornell University as early as the 1870s, it wasn\u2019t until 1983 that the final Ivy League school, Columbia College, started to admit women:\n\nAccording to Time, the term \u201csexual harassment\u201d was coined by a group of students at Cornell University in 1975. The term was popularized in a New York Times article published that same year, and in 1977, three court cases confirmed that a woman could take legal action against her employer for sexual harassment:\n\nThe phrase \u201csexual harassment\u201d was coined in 1975, by a group of women at Cornell University. A former employee of the university, Carmita Wood, filed a claim for unemployment benefits after she resigned from her job due to unwanted touching from her supervisor. Cornell had refused Wood\u2019s request for a transfer, and denied her the benefits on the grounds that she quit for \u201cpersonal reasons.\u201d Wood together with activists at the university\u2019s Human Affairs Office, formed a group called Working Women United. At a Speak Out event hosted by the group, secretaries, mailroom clerks, filmmakers, factory workers and waitresses shared their stories, revealing that the problem extended beyond the university setting. The women spoke of masturbatory displays, threats and pressure to trade sexual favors for promotions \u2026 \u2026 By 1977, three court cases confirmed that a woman could sue her employer for harassment under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, using the EEOC as the vehicle for redress. The Supreme Court upheld these early cases in 1986 with Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, which was based on the complaints of Mechelle Vinson, a bank employee whose boss intimidated her into having sex with him in vaults and basements up to fifty times. Vinson was African American, as were many of the litigants in pioneering sexual harassment cases; some historians suggest that the success of racial discrimination cases during these same years encouraged women of color to vigorously pursue their rights at work.\n\nDecide not to have sex if her husband wanted to\n\nThis item is referring to spousal rape. The first person to be convicted of spousal rape in the U.S. was a Massachusetts bartender who broke into the home of his estranged wife in 1979 and raped her:\n\nEnglish common law, the source of much traditional law in the U.S., had long held that it wasn\u2019t legally possible for a man to rape his wife. It was in 1736 that Sir Matthew Hale \u2014 the same jurist who said that it was hard to prove a rape accusation from a woman whose personal life wasn\u2019t entirely \u201cinnocent,\u201d setting the standard that a woman\u2019s past sexual experiences could be used by the defense in a rape case \u2014explained that marriage constituted permanent consent that could not be retracted. That idea stood for centuries. Then, in 1979, a pair of cases highlighted changing legal attitudes about the concept. Until then, most state criminal codes had rape definitions that explicitly excluded spouses. (In fact, as TIME later pointed out, it wasn\u2019t just the case that saying \u201cno\u201d to one\u2019s husband didn\u2019t make the act that followed rape; in addition, saying \u201cno\u201d to one\u2019s husband was usually grounds for him to get a divorce.) As the year opened, a man in Salem, Ore., was found not guilty of raping his wife, though they both stated that they had fought before having sex. But, even as the verdict was returned, a National Organization for Women spokesperson told TIME that \u201cthe very fact that there has been such a case\u201d meant that change was in the air \u2014 and she was quickly proved right. The case believed to be the first-ever American conviction for spousal rape came that fall, when a Salem, Mass., bartender drunkenly burst into the home he used to share with his estranged wife and raped her. It\u2019s not hard to see how this case was the one that made the possibility of rape between a married couple clear to the public: they were in the middle of a divorce, and the crime involved house invasion and violence. As TIME noted, several other states had also adopted laws making it possible to pursue such a case, though they had not yet been put to the test.\n\nEven though the first conviction for spousal rape occurred during the 1970s, it wasn\u2019t until 1993 that spousal rape was officially illegal in all 50 states. While marital rape has been technically illegal in all 50 states since 1993, advocates argue that there are still legal loopholes in some states that allow for marital rape to be treated differently than rape.\n\nObtain health insurance at the same monetary rate as men\n\nThis item refers to the practice of \u201cgender rating\u201d by health insurance companies, which typically resulted in higher premiums for women seeking individual health insurance. In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) sought to do away with the practice.\n\nThis post correctly states that the FDA first approved an oral contraceptive (a birth-control pill called Enovid) in 1957. However, at the time, the pill was only approved for use as a \u201ctreatment of severe menstrual disorders,\u201d and the FDA required that it be labeled with a warning that Enovid will prevent ovulation.\n\nA few years later in 1960, the FDA approved Enovid as a contraceptive. Still, the pill was only available to married couples. It wasn\u2019t until 1972 that birth-control pills were available to all women, regardless of marital status:", "lang": "en"}
