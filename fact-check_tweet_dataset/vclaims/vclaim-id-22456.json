As such, they are also a popular subject of viral social media content and news articles.\n\nIn August 2018, one particular wedding story prompted outrage and bemusement across the globe, as well as widespread coverage by some of the world\u2019s most-read websites.\n\nA purported Facebook \u201crant\u201d by a woman named \u201cSusan,\u201d explaining why she and her fianc\u00e9 had broken off their engagement, ended their relationship, and cancelled their wedding, provoked breathless headlines and generally credulous reports, such as the following by the Daily Mail:\n\nA disgruntled bride-to-be has revealed she was forced to cancel her extravagant \u2018fairytale\u2019 wedding after her guests refused to pay $CAD 1,500 each to attend. The Canadian bride, who is known only as \u2018Susan\u2019, was due to tie the knot with her childhood sweetheart in a lavish $CAD 60,000 ($46,020) wedding. But the couple decided to call off the ceremony just four days before exchanging their vows after they struggled to foot the bill. Taking to Facebook to explain their decision, the furious mother-of-one blamed her family and friends for the breakdown of her relationship as she vented her frustration in a lengthy post.\n\nOn 24 August, the following tirade about the reasons behind the wedding cancellation was posted to Twitter by a user with the handle @grumpstorm:\n\nAn update followed, purportedly from a cousin of \u201cSusan,\u201d which offered some supposed background information and a number of very personal criticisms of \u201cSusan\u201d:\n\nAnother version of the \u201ccousin\u2019s\u201d contribution was posted to the image-hosting web site Imgur.\n\nOn 25 August, Twitter user @0lspicykeychain also posted screenshots of the Facebook rant which went viral after they were shared by the model Chrissy Teigen.\n\nThe 24 August tweets by @grumpstorm are the earliest instances of the \u201cSusan\u201d rant that we have found online so far. That Twitter user said the screengrabs were taken from a Facebook post, which appears to have originated in a Facebook group called \u201cThat\u2019s It, I\u2019m Wedding Shaming.\u201d\n\nThat group was either hidden or deleted from Facebook as of 28 August 2018, so we were unable to further investigate the origins of either the screenshots of \u201cSusan\u2019s\u201d rant or the additional detail posted by a person identified as her cousin.\n\nAmid extensive online news coverage of \u201cSusan\u2019s\u201d wedding cancellation, thousands of Facebook users flocked to a separate Facebook group with a similar name to \u201cThat\u2019s It, I\u2019m Wedding Shaming,\u201d but that is not the group in which this episode originated online.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what the origins are of the claim that \u201cSusan\u201d is Canadian, as reported by the Daily Mail and other sites. The Facebook post written by a person described as being related to \u201cSusan\u201d notes that \u201cThis woman has never been outside the US \u2026\u201d which would effectively rule out the possibility that \u201cSusan\u201d is Canadian \u2014 although we cannot verify the authenticity of either \u201cSusan\u2019s\u201d rant or the musings of her \u201ccousin,\u201d which were posted after the tirade first went viral.\n\nWe were also unable to verify the existence of Susan using the name of her child (included in one of the screenshots), nor were we able to find any GoFundMe campaign relating to \u201cSusan\u2019s\u201d wedding despite the references to one found in the tirade. This might mean that no such campaign ever existed, or it might mean that it has simply since been deleted.\n\nFor now, it remains unclear whether the rant was authentic, whether \u201cSusan\u201d is a real person (Canadian or not), and whether the person who joined in the mockery and schadenfreude on Facebook was, in fact, related to her. Nonetheless, other news organizations and widely-read web sites throughout the world, including Fox News, the London Independent, the Daily Mirror, and Elle reported the episode at face value without documenting that they had made efforts (successful or otherwise) to verify key elements of the story.", "lang": "en"}
