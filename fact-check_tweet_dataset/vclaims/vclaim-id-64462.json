For starters, many people encountered this message as a screenshot, not on Woolery\u2019s timeline. Second, some suspected that the supposed \u201ckarma\u201d of these messages was a bit too on the nose.\n\nThis was a genuine tweet from Woolery, whose account, unfortunately, was deleted without explanation two days later on July 15. An archived version of that tweet is available here.\n\nWoolery has not provided any additional information about the condition of his son.", "lang": "en"}
