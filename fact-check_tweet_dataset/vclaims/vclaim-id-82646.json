If you want the election in your constituency to happen through a ballot paper and not EVM, then help more candidates to contest the election. This will save our democracy. \"\n\nThe hashtag #BanEVM has been used in many of the messages which were shared.\n\nIn a tweet, Sheyphali Sharan, official spokesperson of the Election Commission of India (ECI), denied any such measure introduced by the ECI and urged voters not to believe the piece of misinformation.\n\nSharan also mentioned that the most recent EVMs can accommodate up to 384 candidates including the None of the Above (NOTA) section. In fact places where such EVMs are required, the ECI will deploy them, Sharan mentioned. You can view Sharan\u2019s tweet thread below.", "lang": "en"}
