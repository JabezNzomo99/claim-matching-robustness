Many of these posts are not even related to the protests.\n\nAnd now, a 16-second video is going viral on social media which shows a group of young boys and girls clapping and dancing on a street when a woman suddenly appears and slaps one of the girls. The caption of the video says, \"When Anti #CAA Protestor meets her Mom\".\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading.

Till the filing of this story, Mohan Vishwa's post was viewed more than 72,000 times and shared over 2,800 times. The archived versions can be seen here and here.\n\nMany other people have also posted the same content on Facebook.\n\nWith the help of keyword search, we found that this video went viral in 2016. This was reported by various news websites.\n\nAs per news reports by \"manoramaonline.com\" and \"The Indian Express\", the incident took place at Payyanur bus stand in Kannur district of Kerala.\n\nSome college students, performing a flash mob, danced at the bus stand when a woman suddenly appeared from the crowd and slapped a girl in the group. A longer version of the video can be found on several YouTube channels.\n\nAs per media reports, the woman was the girl's mother, who got angry as she found her daughter dancing with her friends on the road, instead of attending classes in college.\n\nDuring this time in 2016, when the video went viral, flash mob dances became immensely popular in the country, reaching smaller cities as well. Therefore, the viral post linking this incident to anti-CAA protests is misleading.", "lang": "en"}
