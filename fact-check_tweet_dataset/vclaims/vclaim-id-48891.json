One such picture post is being shared extensively which shows the sign outside Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in Washington.\n\nThe sign in the post reads \u2018Center For Human Global Population Reduction, Bill and Melinda Gate Foundation\u2019. With an increasing number of deaths due to the Coronavirus, people are speculating that the virus could be a set-up by Gates to reduce the human population.\n\nThe caption of the post read: \u201cCenter For Human Global Population Reduction, Bill and Melinda Gate Foundation. Can the World ask them what they know about this? I mean the Gates who want to give us Vaccines. #EvilSouls\u201d\n\nWhen NewsMobile did a fact-check, we found that the picture is morphed.\n\nWe ran a simple search of \u2018Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation\u2019 address on Google maps and saw the sign at the entrance using the Street View mode.\n\nThe sign engraved on the wall reads \u2018BILL & MELINDA GATES foundation\u2019.\n\nOn comparing both the pictures in the Real vs FAKE collage, it becomes clear that the picture has been altered digitally.\n\nHence, our investigation proves that the picture in question has been morphed and \u2018Center For Human Global Population Reduction\u2019 is added using a software.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
