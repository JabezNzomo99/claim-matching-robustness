They urge people to avoid leather (see: \"How to Wear Vegan\"). A recent Facebook post suggests they lobbied the wrong people.\n\n\"This is how police found one of three missing PETA protesters who chose a biker rally to whine about leather usage,\" reads the text above a photo of a man taped to a tree.\n\nThe post, which was published on Facebook on April 10, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe tried to track down the photo's origin, but weren't able to conclusively find its source. Searching for the photo elsewhere online, however, we found it on blogs and websites as early as 2008. Our search also led us to this 2010 story on the website Glossynews.com.\n\nThe headline is, \"Activists missing after declaring \u2018war on leather\u2019 at motorcycle rally.\" Here\u2019s an excerpt:\n\n\"They peed on me!!!\" charged one activist. \"They grabbed me, and said I looked like I was French, and started calling me \u2018La Trene\u2019, and duct taped me to a tree so they could pee on me all day!\"\n\nIf you think that sounds unbelievable, please trust your intuition. Because Glossynews.com markets itself on its website as \"Glossy News Satire.\"\n\n\"We are fake news!\" it says at the top of the site.\n\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
