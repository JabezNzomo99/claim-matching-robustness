So Robinson was not jailed for engaging in journalism, or for merely reporting on alleged criminality. He was jailed for violating a court order, breaching the terms of an existing suspended sentence, and potentially risking the collapse of an ongoing trial.\n\nIn May 2017, Robinson \u2014 the founder of the far-right, conspiracy-mongering English Defence League, and whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon \u2014 was arrested for contempt of court after filming inside Canterbury Crown Court in the south-eastern English county of Kent. As reported by Kent Online at the time, Robinson pleaded guilty to contempt and apologized. He had confronted some of the defendants inside the court building as they left while filming footage which he later uploaded online. Robinson accused police of helping the defendants \u201cescape.\u201d\n\nIn sentencing him on 26 May 2017, Judge Heather Norton said:\n\nThis is not about free speech\u2026 not about the freedom of the Press, nor about legitimate journalism, and not about political correctness. It is about justice and ensuring that a trial can be carried out justly and fairly..it\u2019s about being innocent until proven guilty. It is about preserving the integrity of the jury to continue without people being intimidated..or being affected by irresponsible and inaccurate \u201creporting\u201d, if that\u2019s what it was. \u2026You made it abundantly clear that your mission was to film the defendants, who you referred to by their religion, as \u2018Muslim child rapists\u2019 and \u2018Muslim paedophiles\u2019. \u2026I take a very dim view of your conduct, which was in the face of repeated warnings\u2026There are notices all over the court building making it clear that filming or taking a photograph was an offence and may be a contempt of court. You were told very clearly by the security staff at this court that you were to stop filming.\n\nRobinson was given a three-month prison sentence, but it was suspended for 18 months on the condition that he did not commit any more criminal offenses.\n\nA year later, on 25 May 2018, Robinson showed up outside Leeds Crown Court in the northern English county of Yorkshire and began broadcasting a Facebook Live video.\n\nIn the video, Robinson confronted men whom he presented as defendants in an ongoing child sexual abuse case, made it clear it was his aim to identify them and show their faces on camera, named several men and listed the purported charges against them, and in one instance encouraged the \u201cmainstream media\u201d to harass a man he had earlier shown on camera, as he arrived in court.\n\nAccording to the Hull Daily Mail, some of the charges Robinson associated with named defendants were inaccurate. That type of factual error \u2014 broadcast to a potentially huge audience \u2014 could have serious consequences in a criminal trial. During the course of the 75-minute video, Robinson openly declared \u201cthere is a reporting restriction on this case,\u201d acknowledged that he was already on a suspended sentence for contempt of court and said \u201cI have to be super-careful.\u201d\n\nThe closing moments of the video showed police arresting Robinson outside the court for breach of the peace, a public order offense. Later that day, Judge Geoffrey Marson of Leeds Crown Court gave Robinson a 13-month prison sentence for contempt of court and violating his existing suspended sentence, ruling that the content of his Facebook Live video had the potential to prejudice and collapse the ongoing trial. Robinson had pleaded guilty.\n\nAccording to LeedsLive, Marson watched the Facebook video in court before telling Robinson:\n\nThe Hull Daily Mail quoted Marson as giving concrete examples of the harm that Robinson\u2019s video had the potential to cause:\n\nMarson placed reporting restrictions on Robinson\u2019s arrest and sentencing, but those restrictions were lifted after a successful application by LeedsLive on 29 May. In a textbook example of how reporting restrictions postpone but do not prohibit acts of journalism, local and national news media honored Marson\u2019s order over the weekend and refrained from reporting on Robinson\u2019s sentencing until the order was lifted.\n\nThe reporting restrictions in the child sexual abuse case remain in place.\n\nThe UK news media faces strict rules on what they can and cannot publish about an ongoing trial. Some of these are in place by default, while others require a court order and are at the discretion of judges.\n\nFor example, the complainant, or victim, in a sexual assault case cannot be named, unless they waive their automatic right to anonymity, but it might require a court order for the media to be restrained from publishing the identity of \u2014 for example \u2014 a minor or a vulnerable witness.\n\nGuidelines in place in the UK state that a judge can postpone, but not prohibit, the publication of otherwise \u201cfair and accurate reports.\u201d The overarching principle in place is to avoid the publication of anything which \u201ccreates a substantial risk of serious prejudice to the administration of justice\u201d if it is published during a trial.\n\nIn particular, judges are sensitive to the publication of even accurate news reports in circumstances where two separate trials are linked. In that way, the \u201cprejudice\u201d being avoided can relate to the same trial or a future trial involving the same defendants or complainants, or relating to the same events or circumstances.", "lang": "en"}
