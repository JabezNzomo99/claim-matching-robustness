While the Fact Checker was on break, Sen. Mark Pryor issued an ad that falsely suggested that Rep. Tom Cotton, his GOP opponent, was responsible for the spread of the Ebola virus because of a vote he had cast. The ad was widely criticized in the state, and earned a \u201cmostly false\u201d rating from PolitiFact.\n\nNow, Cotton has fired back with his own misleading ad. It opens with grainy, sepia-toned images of workers in apparently a bygone time, and then charges that Pryor (and \u201cliberals in Washington,\u201d as the ad flashes images of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and President Obama) want to give Social Security benefits \u201cfor work they did with forged identities.\u201d\n\nAs it turns out, this stems from a 2006 vote, before Obama was president, and it is a claim that has been repeatedly debunked by fact checkers. It even made FactCheck.org\u2019s \u201cWhoppers of 2006.\u201d But that hasn\u2019t stopped the Cotton campaign from dredging up the muck again.\n\nUndocumented workers are not eligible for Social Security. Yet with few exceptions, workers in the United States must pay a portion of their earnings to Social Security, which is matched by their employer. Thus workers in the country illegally who have fraudulent or unauthorized Social Security numbers are paying into the system, but do not get any benefits.\n\nStill, until the law was changed in 2008, the Social Security Administration would process claims for credit for those payments in benefit calculations if a formerly illegal immigrant became a legal resident \u2014 and the worker could prove he or she had made payments to the Social Security system.\n\nThat\u2019s why this ad has to reach back to a vote in 2006. At the urging of then President George W. Bush, Congress was trying to pass a comprehensive immigration bill. David Ray, a Cotton campaign spokesman, pointed to an account in the Christian Science Monitor of one important week in the debate as evidence for the fact that Pryor cast a crucial vote at the behest of liberal advocates.\n\nThe newspaper described how Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.), a foe of the immigration bill, \u201ctook the bill\u2019s core supporters by surprise\u201d by offering an amendment that would prevent undocumented immigrants in the United States from claiming Social Security credit for the years they worked with forged Social Security numbers. The move was intended to break apart a fragile bipartisan coalition for the bill. The newspaper added:\n\nThe very next paragraph offers an observation from Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a supporter of the bill, who along with 10 other Republicans voted against the Ensign amendment: \u201cA lot of us took tough votes where we would have liked to vote the other way, but we didn\u2019t, because we wanted to hold the coalition together.\u201d\n\nIn other word\u2019s Pryor\u2019s vote was part of an effort to defeat a poison pill amendment \u2014 and he was joined by a number of Republicans who wanted to keep the bill intact. (For the record, Obama, then a senator, also voted against the amendment.) The broader immigration bill ultimately passed the Senate by a vote of 62-36, but never became law.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the whole story. In 2007, Ensign twice offered a version of his amendment again \u2014 and both times, Pryor voted for it. When Ensign altered his proposal so that it barred the Social Security Administration from spending money to process such back claims from formerly undocumented immigrants, he scored an overwhelming 92-2 victory. The provision remains in law, and the SSA refers to it as the \u201cEnsign amendment.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s still not the end of the story. Remember the 2013 debate over a comprehensive immigration law? Yet another amendment sought to make the ban on receiving past credit permanent (the Ensign Amendment, after all, just prevents the spending of money to process claims). Pryor not only voted for this amendment, but he was listed as a cosponsor as well.\n\nTo recap, workers who are in the country illegally cannot get Social Security benefits, even if they have paid into the system. They can no longer get credit for those payments even if they become legal residents \u2014 because of a change in the law that Pryor supported. Moreover, there is currently no effort in Congress or the Obama administration to change that reality.\n\nVoters need to be especially wary of claims that appear to be largely based on votes from many years ago. Cotton is highlighting a minor vote from eight years ago, ignoring Pryor\u2019s more recent and more substantive votes \u2014 not to mention the fact that law was changed to prevent the processing of such claims.\n\nMoreover, no matter what one might think of the initial vote, there\u2019s certainly no justification for the ad to assert that \u201con illegal immigration, Pryor never takes your side\u201d \u2014 given that he voted three out of four times against undocumented immigrants on this issue.", "lang": "en"}
