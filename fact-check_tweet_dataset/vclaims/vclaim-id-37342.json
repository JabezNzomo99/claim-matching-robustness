In his seven minute-long monologue, which included false and previously debunked claims, Zolotov spoke directly to Alexei Navalny, the head of the Anti-Corruption Foundation and leading Russian opposition figure.\n\nIn a bizarre linguistic mixture, including references to the \u201cofficer\u2019s code of honor\u201d and the use of \u201cblatnoy\u201d or \u201cvorovskoy\u201d [thieves\u2019] jargon \u2013 Russian criminal slang -- Zolotov accused Navalny of slander and challenged him to a duel, demanding \u201csatisfaction\u201d and promising to make a \u201cgood juicy chop\u201d of him in a \"matter of minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Navalny, I promise you, before I step over you and wipe my feet on you, I will stage a show for the entire Rosgvardiya staff, and I assure you, after that you will be ashamed to go outside. And I know how to keep my word,\u201d Zolotov said.\n\nZolotov was responding to a recent investigation by Navalny\u2019s Anti-Corruption Foundation accusing Rosgvardiya\u2019s leadership of stealing at least $29 million in Russian government budget funds.\n\nThe Kremlin \u201cdoes not regard\u201d Zolotov\u2019s statement as \u201ca physical threat,\u201d said Dmitry Peskov, President Vladimir Putin\u2019s press secretary. He added: \u201cSometimes unscrupulous slander can be fought by any means \u2026 And of course it\u2019s better to nip such slander in the bud.\u201d\n\nPeskov\u2019s claim is false: Zolotov made it clear that his video message was a warning to Navalny not to take his words lightly. Zolotov also promised to physically harm Navalny and assured the opposition leader he knows how to keep his promises.\n\nApart from Zolotov\u2019s own words, Article 119 of Russia\u2019s criminal code states such threats are unlawful:\n\n\u201cThreat of Murder or Infliction of Grave Injury to Health\n\n1.Threat of murder or infliction of grave injury to health, if there were grounds to fear the realization of this threat, shall be punishable by obligatory labor for a term of up to 480 hours, or by restraint of liberty for a term of up to two years, or by compulsory labor for a term of up two years, or by arrest for a term of up to six months, or by deprivation of liberty for a term of up to two years.\n\n2.The same deed committed by reason of political, ideological, racial, national or religious hatred or enmity, or by reason of hatred or enmity with respect to some social group - shall be punishable by compulsory labor for a term of up to five years accompanied by deprivation of the right to \u2026 engage in specified activities for a term up to three years\u2026, or by deprivation of liberty for a term of up to five years accompanied by deprivation of the right to hold specified offices or engage in specified activities for a term up to three years...\u201d\n\nNote that Article 119 states: \u201cif there were grounds to fear the realization of this threat.\u201d As noted above, Zolotov made it clear that his threat was real and that Navalny has \u201cgrounds to fear\u201d him.\n\nViktor Zolotov was Vladimir Putin\u2019s martial arts sparring partner starting in the early 1990s, then his chief of security during Putin\u2019s first two terms as president and then his term as prime minister. In 2016, Rosgvardiya, an independent militarized police force reporting directly and exclusively to Russia\u2019s president, was created and Zolotov was appointed as its director. Experts described Rosgvardiya was Putin\u2019s \u201cpraetorian guard.\u201d Zolotov is also a member of the Kremlin\u2019s Security Council.\n\nThe United States sanctioned Viktor Zolotov, along with 23 other close Putins associates, this past April.\n\nSince 2016, Rosgvardiya has played a key role in dealing with mass protests in Russia. Thousands of video and pictures have been posted online of Zolotov\u2019s guards suppressing protests with unnecessary force and brutality.", "lang": "en"}
