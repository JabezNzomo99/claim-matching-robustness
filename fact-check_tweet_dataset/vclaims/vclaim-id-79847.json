Kamala Harris \u201csetting the record straight\u201d about her name in a tweet.\n\nThere is no record of Harris tweeting the statement. The tweet is fabricated.\n\nAt first glance, the tweet appears to be an authentic post from Harris, whom former Vice President Joe Biden on Aug. 11 announced as his 2020 running mate. In the purported tweet, Harris seems to address disparaging nicknames given to her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really upsetting how President Trump and his supporters are disparaging to not only women, but women of color,\u201d reads the alleged tweet. \u201cSo setting the record straight. My name is Sen Kamala Harris. Not Headboard Harris, not Heels Up Harris, and not Kamalatoe Harris. I\u2019m under a lot of stress and I don\u2019t need this sh*t right now.\u201d\n\nBut a closer examination of the tweet reveals red flags that indicate it was fabricated. Her name is misspelled as \u201cKanala Harris.\u201d The tweet is also dated either Oct. 8, which has not come to pass yet, or Aug. 10, depending on whether the person who created the tweet writes dates with the day before the month or vice versa.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation searched for the tweet on Harris\u2019 verified Twitter accounts \u2013 @KamalaHarris and @SenKamalaHarris \u2013 and found no matches. There is also no record of it in ProPublica\u2019s archive of her deleted tweets on Aug. 10 or any other date.
