Gov. Casey Cagle for the job that mostly presides over a tantrum-prone state Senate.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia, and our PolitiFact national arm, have fact-checked various incarnations of the gender-wage claim before.\n\nFor example, we gave Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Michelle Nunn a rating in April for her statement, \"On average, women make 77 cents for every dollar men make.\"\n\nHer qualifier \"on average\" and broad statement kept the claim on target.\n\nBy contrast, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter \u2013 the grandfather of the Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jason Carter \u2013 earned a rating for his statement that, \"in the United States for the same exact work for a full-time employee, women get 23 percent less pay than men.\"\n\nIn those cases, they were referring to a 2010 U.S. Census Bureau study that examined total wages of male and female workers. Men\u2019s total wages were about 23 percent higher than women\u2019s, the study found.\n\nBut the gap was due in part to men working more hours, the study concluded. It did not look at pay rates for the same work or the same number of hours.\n\nStokes avoided the specifics of numbers in her statement. And other data backs up her claim of an overall wage gap between men and women. Her claim, however, gets more problematic as she gets more specific.\n\nLooking at weekly wages, a 2011 Bureau of Labor Statistics report found women earned 81 percent of men\u2019s wages for all occupations ( ).\n\nThe gap is smaller than the Census figures, which rely on annual wages and can therefore include pensions, bonuses and other factors that widen the difference.\n\nThose different conclusions show the inherent problem with bold statements on a wage gap, especially when referencing specific numbers.\n\nNumbers also don\u2019t tell the whole story about the second part of Stokes\u2019 claim, that women are paid less \"for the same work.\"\n\nAgain, the data overwhelmingly back up the broad claim \u2013 but not in every field.\n\nThe 2011 BLS report shows women actually earn 12 cents more than men in the food preparation/serving industries, 10 cents more as \"billing and posting clerks and machine operators\" and 5 cents more than men working as store clerks.\n\nYet beyond those three jobs, and looking at broad industry categories, women still earn less than men overall ( ).\n\nStokes said that was the point to her statement.\n\n\"We know the numbers don\u2019t agree because of the variables, but we all know that women are paid less than men,\" Stokes said. \"That\u2019s the bottom line.\"\n\nIf the point is women earn less than men, it would be. But the comparisons are not as simple as they seem at first blush.\n\nExperts agree on a gender-based wage gap. Yet differences in life choices such as occupational choices and hours worked can make simple comparisons tricky.\n\nThe gap can narrow, for instance, when accounting for education level and specific jobs. Stokes was on target to cite a gender pay gap. But vastly oversimplifies the \"same work\" claim -- it does matter what job is being performed.\n\nStokes claim is accurate on one level. But a lot of context is needed to really understand what is going on.", "lang": "en"}
