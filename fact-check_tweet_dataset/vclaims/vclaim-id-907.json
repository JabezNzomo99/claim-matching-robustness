That was in 2012, when there were 2.15 million businesses registered for VAT or PAYE. It\u2019s now 2.45 million.\n\nIt said that the number \u201cmay be significantly higher\u201d once businesses trading in services were added, but didn\u2019t have data on this.\n\nVote Leave uses a separate set of estimates for the number of companies exporting to the EU, rather than including importing companies as Stronger In does here. We\u2019ve got more on this here.", "lang": "en"}
