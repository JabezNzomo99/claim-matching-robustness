Bill Young\u2019s death, the Republican Party of Florida started a full-court press attack.\n\nThe Florida GOP posted a criticizing Sink on a host of issues, presumably attacks they pulled from their arsenal when she ran against Rick Scott for governor in 2010.\n\n\"As Florida\u2019s CFO, Alex Sink failed Florida taxpayers by using the state plane as her own personal charter, overseeing a $27 billion loss in the state\u2019s pension fund and supporting a $5.2 billion increase in Florida\u2019s debt,\" the video\u2019s text reads.\n\nWe\u2019ll examine other claims from the ad during the race, but in this fact-check we\u2019ll focus on looking into Sink\u2019s tie to the state pension fund. Is it accurate to say she oversaw $27 billion in losses?\n\nAs the state\u2019s chief financial officer, Sink\u2019s responsibilities included accounting, auditing and managing Florida\u2019s finances. She also served on the State Board Administration of Florida, the office that oversees the pension fund.\n\nIn their , the SBA put the value of pension assets at $132 billion.\n\nIn 2007, the year Sink took office, the pension was worth , according to the SBA. In 2010, her last year as CFO, that value was down to . That makes the net loss $27 billion, as the ad said.\n\nThis claim echoes those made by the party when Sink ran for governor against Republican Rick Scott. As we\u2019ve , there are several important caveats to this claim.\n\nThe action of comparing how much the pension is worth at different points in history is not as devastating as it might sound.\n\nThere\u2019s no permanent loss in value until the assets are sold. Although the pension was temporarily worth less in 2010 than in 2007, the money isn\u2019t gone by any means.\n\nWhen the nation started recovering from the recession a couple of years ago, the Florida pension followed suit.\n\n\"The pension fund is in pretty good shape right now,\" said Kurt Wenner, vice president for tax research at Florida TaxWatch, a business-backed institute focused on tax issues. \"It certainly wasn\u2019t a critical situation.\"\n\nBesides the figures not being permanent, the implication that Sink, as CFO, is to blame for the loss in value is also misleading.\n\nThree SBA trustees jointly oversee the pension fund: the governor, the attorney general and the CFO. There\u2019s nothing that suggests Sink\u2019s responsibilities should be singled out above those of either former Gov. Charlie Crist or former Attorney General Bill McCollum (who were both Republicans at the time, by the way).\n\nThe Republican Party of Florida said there was a loss of pension assets of $27 billion during Sink\u2019s term as the state\u2019s CFO. But that doesn\u2019t represent a permanent loss of funds. We also see no reason why Sink deserves more of the blame than the other two trustees. And, Sink was CFO during a historic recession. Given these sizeable caveats, we rate the Florida GOP\u2019s claim Half True.", "lang": "en"}
