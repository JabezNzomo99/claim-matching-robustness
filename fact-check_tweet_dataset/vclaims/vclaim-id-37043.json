The backpack was connected to the cow\u2019s stomach through a hole in its ribs, and was collecting what would have been burps, not \u201cfarts,\u201d as the Facebook post claims.\n\nBut, most importantly, the backpack was not intended as a device to keep methane out of the atmosphere. Rather, it was used to help scientists study how cow\u2019s digest what they eat.\n\nThe same researchers who worked on that project used a similar gas collection system a year earlier to study the methane produced in the digestion of dairy cows. That study, which lasted 28 days and included six cows, found that the addition of tannins (an additive derived from plants) to the cows\u2019 diet led to a 28 percent decrease in methane production.\n\nA later project by the same researchers, done in 2013, used the collection system to transform the methane into biofuel.\n\nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, between 50 percent and 65 percent of methane emissions around the world come from human activity, including the use of livestock, and the impact on the global climate is 25 times greater than the impact of carbon dioxide over 100 years.\n\nThe agriculture sector was responsible for about 9 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2017, according to the EPA.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
