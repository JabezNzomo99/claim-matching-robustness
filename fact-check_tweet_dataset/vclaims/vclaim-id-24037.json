However, it breaches the one agreement Lavrov failed to mention \u2013 the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "July 18, 2019", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-24037", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-iran-nuclear-deal-russia/30063369.html", "vclaim": "Any escalation of the situation with Iran or in the region as a whole is \u201cnot in Moscow\u2019s interests,\u201d Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told RT on July 9, commenting on Tehran\u2019s announcement it would begin enriching uranium above 3.67%.\n\nLavrov said the U.S. withdrawal from the agreement with Iran and non-compliance with the corresponding UN resolution amid accusations against Tehran created a \u201cparadoxical situation.\u201d\n\nReporting on Lavrov\u2019s comments, RT wrote: \u201cAccording to the minister, Iran's decision to start uranium enrichment above the level of 3.67%, which is provided for by the nuclear deal, does not violate either the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons or the safeguards agreement with the IAEA, or the additional protocol to that agreement.\u201d\n\nLavrov\u2019s statement was accurate, except for the detail that he left out, Daryl Kimball, Executive Director of the Arms Control Association, told Polygraph.info.\n\n\u201cThe statement by itself is accurate in the part that Iran\u2019s decision does not violate the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, does not violate the safeguards agreement with the IAEA, and the additional protocol to the agreement,\u201d Kimball said.\n\n\u201cWhat Mr. Lavrov leaves out is that Iran\u2019s decision to begin enriching uranium above 3.67% does breach one of the several limitations established by the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which prohibits Iran from enriching uranium above 3.67%.\u201d\n\nThe JCPOA is the nuclear agreement reached between Iran and the P5+1 (China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the U.S.) in July 2015, under which Tehran promised that its nuclear program will be exclusively peaceful in exchange for a waiver of certain economic and diplomatic restrictions. The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 2231 endorsed the deal a week later. That resolution terminated UN sanctions related to the nuclear program, subject to a \u201csnapback\u201d upon later UNSC action.\n\nIn May 2018, President Donald Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the JCPOA and reinstate U.S. sanctions against Iran. The U.S. is also is demanding that its European allies and partners cut off most of their business with Tehran.\n\nUnder the JCPOA, Tehran could have no more than 300 kilograms of 3.67% enriched uranium. On July 1, Iran said that it had exceeded the 300-kilogram cap. The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that Iran had crossed that line.\n\nOn July 7, Iran announced that it had resumed enriching uranium at a concentration above 3.67%.\n\nUranium must be close to 90% enriched to be considered weapons grade. Before the JCPOA was signed, Iran was reportedly enriching large quantities of uranium to around 20%. Experts say that, technically, the gap between 20% and 90% enrichment is small.", "lang": "en"}
