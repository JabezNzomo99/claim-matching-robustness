And three minutes later the police see a guy in the neighborhood with a Flyers hat, he is going to get stopped,\" he said, \"And since you told them he has a gun, they are going to frisk him. So the issue for us is those frisks are ... constitutional and legitimate based on a call on 911 from a citizen.\"\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Kenney is making a legal distinction here. If we\u2019re talking about stop-and-frisk as a policy that disproportionately targets black and Hispanic men with little basis for the stops, then that\u2019s one thing. But, \"a frisk that is based on reasonable suspicion that the person has a weapon is constitutional,\" Mary Catherine Roper, deputy legal director of the ACLU of Pennsylvania, wrote in an email. She cautioned that a reasonable search \"might a (call for) more than a Flyers hat on game day,\" but added, \"Mayor Kenney is certainly describing a process that is permitted under the law.\"\n\nPolice Commissioner Richard Ross in February that eliminating stop-and-frisk isn\u2019t altogether possible. \"At the risk of sounding flip, there's no city that has the authority to end stop-and-frisk,\" said Ross. \"The best you could do as a city is decide you want to have a precipitous drop - the only danger in that is, it's kind of a reverse quota, it suggests you had to have (a quota) in the first place.\"\n\nIn his campaign materials, Team Kenney did note that he would \"not permit the continued prevalence of impermissible stops-and-frisks,\" and that he would create a new reasonable suspicion training program so that police would better grasp the difference.\n\nKenney didn\u2019t always delineate these practices with care on the campaign trail, however. Kenney stated he would straight-up end stop-and-frisk, no ifs, no caveats, and he did so repeatedly. \"\"If (I'm) mayor, stop-and-frisk will end in Philadelphia, no question,\" Kenney last April. \"(I) would like to work with Commissioner Ramsey as well as the FOP to find a responsible way to bring that practice to an end.\"\n\nAfter his primary win, he doubled down, \"If you have a program that divides the community from the police and it doesn\u2019t result in anything positive going forward,\" Kenney told press, \"It should be stopped \u2026 I\u2019m going to tell (then-Commissioner Ramsey) that in the end, it doesn\u2019t make police officers safer, it doesn\u2019t make citizens safer.\"\n\nSeveral outlets, , have noted the discrepancy between popular campaign statements and his actual goals as mayor. At Ross\u2019 January swearing-in, Kenney summed up the knottiness of the stop-and-frisk himself, describing it as \"unfortunate terminology used as a crime fighting tool.\"\n\nThe legal considerations for quelling a policy like stop-and-frisk weren\u2019t lost on Kenney during the campaign. His written campaign materials appear consistent with his stance now. Multiple statements given to reporters along the trail, though, spoke to ceasing the practice absolutely, without the stipulations that Kenney had clarified elsewhere.
