If the image were to be believed, some 8 percent of the entire U.S. Marine Corps volunteered for White House detail in a single week, while not a single Marine volunteered during the previous eight years. Additionally, Marines have told us that those who serve on the White House detail are hand-picked, and the Corps doesn\u2019t need to engage in a \u201ccasting call\u201d to fill the few available spots.\n\nWe reached out to U.S. Marine Spokesman Major Clark Carpenter, who told us that the numbers \u201cdidn\u2019t sound right\u201d but averred that he didn\u2019t have accurate information immediately available. And a Marine spokesperson confirmed that \u201cMarines serving in White House duty are generally not volunteers and are assigned from the eligible population through the Marine Corps\u2019 routine manpower processes.\u201d\n\nThe embedded video above was produced during President Obama\u2019s first term in 2009. While Cpl. James Applewhite did not go into detail about the selection process, he did say that he was \u201cpretty lucky\u201d to get the position: \u201cThe White House post is one of those posts they tell you about, but no one expects to come here. It\u2019s very selective. There\u2019s only four Marines in the entire Marine Corps that get to do it, so I was pretty lucky to get the position.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
