But Obama also governed for 19\u00bd days in January 2017, so it\u2019s fair to give him some, if not most, of the credit for the uptick to 62.9 percent at the end of that month.\n\nOn \u201cMornings With Maria,\u201d McCarthy mentioned the labor force participation rate as part of his argument that things were getting better under Trump. But presidents and the bills they sign have only so much influence on the labor force participation rate.\n\nLabor economists and other experts do not directly attribute this decline to any one president\u2019s policy preferences, successes or failures. Rather, they look at trends spanning years or decades, such as more youths seeking higher education instead of going directly to work. Or they look at economic shocks, such as the recession Obama inherited in 2009. The retirement of the baby-boom generation also is an important factor.\n\n\u201cThe post-recession decline partly reflects the aging of the baby-boom generation, whose members have been reaching typical retirement ages (the oldest of the group turned 65 in 2011). But it also reflects declining participation within some age groups. \u201cFor men between the ages of 25 and 54, participation, which had been falling gradually over a period of four decades, fell by another 1.4 percentage points from 2009 to 2013. Participation among women in the same age group rose steadily between the 1950s and late 1990s, but then flattened for several years and fell by 1.8 percentage points from 2009 to 2013. Participation among men and women under age 25 fell by 1.8 percentage points between 2009 and 2013, a decline that was roughly in line with its trend over the previous decade. And participation among people between the ages of 55 and 64, which had been rising before the recession, has edged slightly lower since 2009. In contrast, the pronounced upward trend in the participation rate among people age 65 or older since the mid-1990s has continued.\u201d\n\nA 2017 report on labor force participation pre-recession, commissioned by the Social Security Advisory Board and written by five economists, laid out a few theories for this decline aside from baby-boomer retirements. The slump in female labor participation is \u201cdifficult to explain,\u201d the authors concluded. But the \u201cleading explanation for male decline is that it has been a result of declines in labor demand for lower\u2010skilled workers.\u201d The report listed factors such as \u201cskill\u2010biased technological change, trade, outsourcing, etc.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s feel-good talking points should steer clear of the labor force participation rate until it truly rises above the level where Obama left it. Even then, it\u2019s important to remember that presidents have only limited powers to move this needle and do not necessarily deserve credit or blame when the situation improves or worsens.\n\nAs McCarthy\u2019s spokeswoman says, the rate did go above 62.9 percent for a few months after Trump took office, and there are indeed \u201cmore people in the workforce.\u201d However, for giving credit where no credit is due, McCarthy gets Two Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
