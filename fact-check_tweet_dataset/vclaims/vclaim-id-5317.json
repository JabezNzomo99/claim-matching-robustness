No, just like two years ago the story is not true. It was copied by a fauxtire site from a website that makes up tales about bizarre crimes and sex acts for entertainment purposes. But despite the blatant copyright infringement the story still isn't real.\n\nThe story was republished in an article on 8Shit on July 19, 2018 under the headline \"Morgue Worker Arrested After Giving Birth To A Dead Man's Baby\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nA 26-year-old morgue worker was arrested this morning after a DNA test revealed that her newborn child was the result of a necrophiliac intercourse with a man she was supposed to autopsy. Jennifer Burrows, an assistant pathologist with the Jackson County medical examiner services, is accused of having sex with dozens of corpses over the course of the last two years, a behavior which led the birth of a baby boy on January 7. According to the Kansas City Missouri Police Department, her baby is the son of a man who died in a car accident in March 2017, and whose body she was supposed to autopsy. They allege that Ms. Burrows sexually abused more than 60 other dead bodies, belonging to males aged from 17 to 71 years of age.\n\nHowever we already debunked the original story from World News Daily Report back in 2016:\n\nJust like the corpse in a zombie-themed horror movie this story keeps coming back alive every now and then. Don't fall for it!\n\nBesides, 8shit.net carries a disclaimer on its about page that reads:\n\nAnd an additional disclaimer in the footer of every page:\n\n8Shit is a satire news and humor website.
