The claim is false; the video has been taken out of context from a sermon Mansur gave in 2009; the original sermon does not mention Widodo; Widodo was not president in 2009.\n\nThis April 24, 2019, Facebook post, which has been viewed more than 2,700 times, contains footage of Muslim preacher Mansur gesturing while delivering a sermon to a packed room.\n\nTranslated to English, the post\u2019s caption reads: \u201cListen to this\u2026 Ucup is reprimanding Jokowi.\u201d\n\nUcup and Jokowi are the popular nicknames of Mansur and President Widodo, respectively.\n\nHere is Widodo\u2019s official Twitter account. Here is Mansur\u2019s official Twitter account.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe logo of the now-defunct Indonesian broadcaster TPI can be seen on the top left corner of the video. The same logo of TPI can be seen in this 2009 news article by Indonesian portal KapanLagi about awards won by the broadcaster then.\n\nIn the video, Mansur can be heard complaining about Indonesia having \u201cdebts\u201d.\n\nAt the beginning of the video, which is 1 minute and 29 seconds long, Mansur can be heard saying: \u201cNowadays anyone has debts. Indonesia has been marked as a country with debts of 1,200 trillion rupiah, not including his debts [points to someone in the audience], mine and the debts of all of us here. The state debts alone are 1,200 trillion rupiah. Why? Because this country is a weak country.\u201d\n\nThe same clip and misleading claim have been posted on YouTube on April 23, 2019, here.\n\nA reverse image search using keyframes from the video traced the origin of the clip to one of Mansur\u2019s sermons recorded in 2009. This YouTube video, published on February 25, 2014, shows the complete clip of Mansur\u2019s preaching, which is 47 minutes and 15 seconds long.\n\nTranslated to English, the title of the original video is: \u201cThe Grace of Giving Alms TPI -- Preacher Yusuf Mansur -- Free From Debts\u201d.\n\nAccording to the caption, the sermon took place on June 16, 2009.\n\nIn the complete version of the video, women can be seen sitting in the rows behind the male audience. A moderator can also be seen sitting next to Mansur.\n\nBelow is the YouTube video showing the complete sermon of Mansur:\n\nMansur expressed his anger over Indonesia\u2019s \u201cdebts\u201d in the video but nowhere in the footage does he mention President Widodo. Widodo was the mayor of Surakarta from 2005 to 2012.\n\nHere is a report about Widodo being named the best mayor in 2009 by a local magazine, published by local news outlet Solopos on November 20, 2009.\n\nMansur was speaking three weeks prior to the July 8, 2009, presidential election that saw three candidates contesting: Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Megawati Soekarnoputri and Jusuf Kalla. Here is the Guardian\u2019s report about the election and the candidates in the race.\n\nAt 17:37 in the original video (1:16 in the Facebook post\u2019s clip), Mansur can be heard saying: \u201cIf the future president still gets into debts, whoever gets elected -- Megawati, SBY [Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono] or Jusuf Kalla -- if he gets into debt, we will make him an enemy.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
