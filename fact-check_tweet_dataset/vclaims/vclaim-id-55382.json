Both attributions are false. The Bruce Lee Foundation said they found no evidence that that quote originates with Lee. The screenshot of a tweet that makes it appear as if the quote comes from Buffett is an imposter account and Buffett\u2019s assistant confirmed he did not say the quote.\n\nThe quote says: \u201cYou will continue to suffer if you have an emotional reaction to everything that is said to you. True power is sitting back and observing everything with logic. If words control you that means everyone else can control you. Breathe and allow things to pass.\u201d\n\nThe quote has been shared on Facebook with various images of Lee here, here and here.\n\nThe posts attributing the quote to Buffett look like this on Facebook and this on Instagram.\n\nHowever, the quote does not come from either famous man.\n\nFans of Lee are regularly treated to quotes from the late film star in meme formats on his official Twitter and Instagram accounts, but this quote has never been featured. Quotes shared by official Lee accounts always include a small yellow image of Lee performing a flying kick.\n\nSydnie Wilson, Director of Licensing for the Bruce Lee Foundation told AFP by email: \u201cI do not have proof to provide that Bruce Lee said this himself.\u201d\n\nWilson said that this episode of a podcast put together by Shannon Lee included similar sentiments to the message, but not the exact quote.\n\nThis screenshots of tweets purporting to come from Buffett were actually shared from the Twitter account @WarrenBuffettHQ. This is an imposter account which has been suspended by Twitter.\n\nThe \u201cOracle of Omaha\u201d has a verified Twitter account @WarrenBuffett, but a search of that account does not find the quote. The quote is also not found when searching archived versions of Buffett\u2019s official Twitter account using the Wayback Machine, an internet archiving tool.\n\nOn Instagram, the post spelled the billionaire investor\u2019s name incorrectly, with only one T.\n\nBuffett\u2019s assistant Debbie Bosanek also told AFP by email: \u201cThe quote in that fake Facebook screenshot is not something that Warren Buffett has ever said.\u201d\n\nThough people regularly share this quote as if it was said by Lee or Buffett, it\u2019s also regularly shared without attribution, including here and here.\n\nThe Quote Investigator, a blog that answers questions about the origins of quotes online, also found no evidence that Lee or Buffett were the source of the quote.", "lang": "en"}
