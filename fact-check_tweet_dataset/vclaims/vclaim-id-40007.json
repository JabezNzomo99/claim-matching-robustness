Four students were critically injured in this violent clash. Several students were arrested and as many as 43 were named accused in the case. The Chennai police commissioner was transferred and an assistant commissioner was suspended.\n\nAccording to a Hindustan Times report of the time, referring to the cause of the clash, \u201cTension had been building up between the two sides after the college celebrated the 101st birthday of freedom fighter Pasumponn Muthuramalinga Thevar almost two weeks ago. Students from \u2018Thevar\u2019 community had put up posters which did not prefix \u201cDr. Ambedkar\u201d to the college name. Dalit students took it as an insult. And, matters came to a head.\u201d The incident was also reported by The Times of Indiaand The New Indian Express. In the most recent development to the case, 21 students who had been sentenced to three-year imprisonment were acquitted of all charges by the Madras High Court.\n\nA video of a violent student clash which occurred in Chennai more than 10 years back, is being circulated on social media with the false claim that these men are BJP followers.", "lang": "en"}
