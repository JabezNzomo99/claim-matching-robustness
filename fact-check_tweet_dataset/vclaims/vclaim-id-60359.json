A pre-race invocation and the singing of the national anthem took place at the organization\u2019s most recent race.\n\nNASCAR announced in a June 10 statement that the Confederate flag would be banned from all of its future events and properties. The flag\u2019s presence at NASCAR events \u201cruns contrary to our commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all fans, our competitors and our industry,\u201d according to the statement.\n\nA viral June 15 Facebook post claims NASCAR has also ended pre-race traditions such as the singing of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\u201d prayers and military flyovers because they are \u201ctoo controversial.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is no evidence NASCAR has done so. The organization\u2019s website doesn\u2019t have any mention of banning such pre-race customs, and no media outlets have reported on a move to that effect. In fact, the pre-race invocation and national anthem were performed before the Geico 500 race in Talladega, Alabama, on June 22, according to video from the event.\n\nNASCAR also confirmed to the Daily Caller in an email that there is no truth to the claim.

Guidelines requiring all racing team members to stand during pre-race national anthem performances were removed from the organization\u2019s rulebook before the June 10 NASCAR race in Atlanta, Georgia, according to CBS Sports.", "lang": "en"}
