The prime minister threatened to freeze some Russian government assets and she suspended high-level diplomat contacts, revoked the invitation to Lavrov to visit Britain this year and said the royal family would not attend the World Cup in Russia..\n\n\u201cThe Government has concluded that it is highly likely that Russia was responsible,\u201d May said, noting \u201cRussia\u2019s record of conducting state sponsored assassinations.\u201d\n\nLavrov\u2019s claim that Russia had \u201cnothing to do\u201d with the poisoning is false given that the poison used was developed in Russia.\n\nTuesday, The White House also said President Trump agreed \u201cthat the Government of the Russian Federation must provide unambiguous answers regarding how this chemical weapon, developed in Russia, came to the used in the United Kingdom.\u201d The statement was a \u201creadout\u201d of a telephone call between Trump and May.\n\nAccording to the Federation of American Scientists, in October 1991, Vil Mirzayanov, a chemist who had worked for more than 25 years in the Soviet chemical weapons program, alleged that Moscow had developed a series of new and extremely lethal \"third generation\" nerve agents under a secret program code-named Foliant. His assertions were confirmed by two other scientists, Lev Fedorov and Vladimir Uglev. It was also claimed that Russia was working on developing new binary chemical warfare agents under the designation Novichok [\"New Guy\"].\n\nMirzayanov alleged that Russia intended to test and produce binary chemical weapons after the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\nAccording to experts, nerve agents of the \u201cNovichok\u201d group are the \u201cdeadliest ever made.\u201d\n\nAfter accusing Russia of \u201cindiscriminate\u201d use of the poison, which \u201cput the lives of innocent civilians at risk,\u201d British Prime Minister May gave Russian President Vladimir Putin until midnight March 13 to explain or face \u201cextensive measures.\u201d\n\nRussia has responded with denials and counter-accusations and warned of reprisals of its own.\n\n\u201cMoscow does not accept the groundless accusations or the language of ultimatums,\u201d said Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin's spokesman.\n\nMay said Moscow had treated the affair with \u201csarcasm, contempt and defiance.\u201d\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s position regarding the poisoning of Skripal and his daughter is limited to aggressive denial: we did not do that but that is going to happen to every traitor,\u201d wrote Anton Orekh, a journalist with Echo of Moscow radio station.\n\nBen Nimmo, a senior analyst with the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Lab, highlighted and debunked the Russian government narrative regarding the poisoning via Twitter, saying it followed \u201da familiar pattern: dismiss, distort, distract, dismay.\u201d\n\nThe Kremlin-funded media outlets RT and Sputnik posted series of reports implying that the British accusations are \u201canti-Russian propaganda\u201d and a \u201cprovocation\u201d cooked up by the U.S. and British intelligence services.\n\nBritain\u2019s communications regulator, Ofcom, said that it would consider the implications of the prime minister\u2019s statement for RT\u2019s broadcast licenses \u2013 a threat to take regulatory action against the Russian state media outlet.\n\n\"Should the UK investigating authorities determine that there was an unlawful use of force by the Russian State against the UK, we would consider this relevant to our ongoing duty to be satisfied that RT is fit and proper,\u201d Ofcom stated.", "lang": "en"}
