The \u00a31bn is specific to the jurisdiction of Northern Ireland and is in addition to funding pledged as a result of the Stormont House Agreement and Fresh Start Agreement. An estimated \u00a3420m remains to be spent.\n\nOn 31 July 2019, Arlene Foster \u2014 the leader of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) \u2014 said that her party will not apologise for \u201cdelivering an extra billion pounds\u201d for Northern Ireland. She added: \u201cNot any other party that has stood before you today has delivered one penny of money for the people of Northern Ireland. We have delivered that through our confidence and supply agreement \u2026\u201d\n\nSince the 2017 General Election, the Conservative Government has relied on the support of the DUP to command a working majority in Parliament. This arrangement was formalised right away after the election in a Confidence and Supply Agreement between the DUP and the Conservative Party, on 26 June 2017. The Government agreed to provide the Northern Ireland Executive with additional financial support: \u00a31 billion over five years.\n\nOn 1 November 2018, we published an article about City Deals being part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement between the DUP and the Conservative Party. We concluded that the UK Government\u2019s support for city deals in Northern Ireland is not explicit in the \u201cConfidence and Supply Agreement\u201d, but is named in a subsequent financial support package agreed by the two parties.\n\nThe official UK Government statement explains that the \u00a31 billion is additional to \u00a32.5 billion of financial support and flexibility provided to the Northern Ireland Executive, by way of the Stormont House Agreement (23 December 2014) and Fresh Start Agreement (17 November 2015). The agreed \u00a31 billion funding falls outside the consideration of the Barnett Formula; the funding is specific to the jurisdiction of Northern Ireland.\n\nWhat does the \u00a31 billion cover?\n\nThe official statement provides details of the extra \u00a31 billion of financial support, in six policy areas:\n\u2022 immediate pressures in health and education (\u00a350m for 2 years)\n\nHow much of the funding has Northern Ireland received?\n\nThe Northern Ireland Budget (Anticipation and Adjustments) (No. 2) Bill 2017-19 was introduced to the House of Commons on 28 February 2019. By November 2018, the Northern Ireland Executive had received just under half of the agreed funding. The Commons Library Insight blog article, \u201cConfidence and Supply: Northern Ireland\u2019s \u00a31 billion\u201d, explains how much of this pledged additional expenditure has been delivered. The figures were obtained using the Estimates process.\n\nIn 2017-18, Parliament approved \u00a320 million of the Confidence and Supply funds to be added to the grant to the Northern Ireland Executive. The Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service told the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee that these funds were spent on education and to alleviate health pressures.\n\nFor 2018-19, Parliament approved a further \u00a3410 million to be added to the grant to the Northern Ireland Executive (\u00a3210 million day-to-day spending and \u00a3200 million investment). The funding was provided for the following areas:\n\u2022 \u00a380 million for immediate health and education (day-to-day spending). Of this \u00a336.5 million is reported to be given to the Northern Ireland Department of Education\n\nThis totals \u00a3430 million spent for financial years 2017-19:\n\nIn regards to the \u00a3150 million tranche for broadband development, on 16 July 2019 the Department for the Economy (DfE) launched a procurement for Project Stratum, which seeks to improve connectivity for those unable to access broadband services of at least 30 Mbps. This expenditure will reduce the amount yet to be drawn down to \u00a3420 million.\n\nHow is the money being spent in Northern Ireland?\n\nThe Chief Executive of the Health and Social Care Board in Northern Ireland explained how the \u00a3100 million allocated to healthcare transformation in 2018-19 will be spent:\n\u2022 \u00a330 million to stabilise the system by stemming the increase in waiting times for both diagnostic and elective care\n\u2022 \u00a315 million for investing in primary care, including \u00a35 million for the initial roll-out of an operating model for multidisciplinary team working within GP practices\n\u2022 \u00a315 million for workforce development across the health and social care system\n\u2022 \u00a330 million of investment in reforming hospital and community services including the establishment of new elective care centres\n\u2022 \u00a35 million on building capacity in communities and in health prevention approaches\n\u2022 \u00a35 million on \u2018enablers\u2019 for transformation, including investment in development of quality improvement initiatives\n\nIn addition, The Department of Education has informed Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People how the \u00a316.5 million awarded in 2018-19 for tackling deprivation is being spent:\n\nThe DUP agreed to support the Government on all key votes and the Government agreed to provide the Northern Ireland Executive with additional financial support: \u00a31 billion over five years. The Confidence and Supply Agreement contained details of the agreed areas of expenditure: infrastructure development, health service transformation, broadband development, immediate pressures in health and education, pockets of severe deprivation, and mental health.\n\nThe agreed \u00a31bn funding is specific to the jurisdiction of Northern Ireland and falls outside the consideration of the Barnett Formula. The \u00a31bn funding is additional to funding pledged as a result of the Stormont House Agreement and Fresh Start Agreement.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Executive has received \u00a3430 million so far, plus \u00a3150 million for an announced broadband development procurement. This suggests that there is \u00a3420 million still to be drawn down.\n\nImage: Photo by Alan Cotton used by license Dreamstime.com\n\nFactCheckNI is Northern Ireland\u2019s first and only dedicated independent fact-checking service and a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network\u2019s Code of Principles.
