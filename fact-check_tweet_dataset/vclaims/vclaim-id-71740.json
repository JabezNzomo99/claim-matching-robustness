The claim is misleading; the footage actually shows PLA soldiers walking through a railway station in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou.\n\nThe video was published here on July 26, 2019, where it has been viewed more than 11,000 times.\n\nIn the 10-second clip, a group of soldiers in camouflage uniform can be seen walking through a railway station.\n\nThe post\u2019s Chinese language caption translates to English as: \u201cChinese People's Liberation Army has entered Hong Kong\u201d.\n\nSimilar versions of the video and claim have circulated widely online, for example here and here in Chinese, and have also appeared around the region, for example this Indonesian-language Facebook post.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe misleading post appeared online two days after China said its army could be deployed in Hong Kong if city authorities requested support in maintaining \"public order\". Here is an AFP report on the issue.\n\nThe PLA has maintained a garrison in Hong Kong since the former British colony was returned to China in 1997.\n\nIn Hong Kong's Basic Law, a copy of which can be seen here, article 14 says: \"The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region may, when necessary, ask the Central People's Government for assistance from the garrison in the maintenance of public order and in disaster relief.\"\n\nBut the video does not show PLA troops \"entering\" Hong Kong -- the footage was actually filmed at Guangzhou South railway station, in mainland China.\n\nPhotos of the terminus published here by Hong Kong-based online news portal HK01 and here by Hong Kong\u2019s Chinese-language newspaper Wen Wei Po show the exact same ceiling design as the building in the misleading video.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading posts (L) and the photos from HK01 (C) and Wen Wei Po (R) with areas that show a similar design circled in red:\n\nThis video uploaded to the YouTube channel of China\u2019s Heilongjiang Television with the title: \u201cGuangzhou South railway station: the high-speed rail station with the highest volume of traffic in the country\u201d also shows the same distinctive roof design.\n\nThe video is embedded below:\n\nBelow is a screenshot of a section of the video, showing the same distinctive roof design as can be seen in the video in the misleading clips:", "lang": "en"}
