Then Spicer cited a Pew study that \u2014 as we noted before \u2014 does not support this claim. Moreover, Spicer conflated the Pew study with another study that \u2014 again \u2014 does not support this claim.\n\nA 2012 Pew Center on the States study found problems with inaccurate voter registrations, people who registered in more than one state (which could happen if the voter moves and registers in the new state without telling the former state) and deceased voters whose information was still on the voter rolls.\n\nThe primary author of the Pew report tweeted in response to Trump\u2019s staff\u2019s claim that he \u201ccan confirm that report made no findings re: voter fraud.\u201d\n\nSpicer said a Pew study from 2008 showed that \u201c14 percent of people who have voted were not citizens.\u201d He likely was referring to research by Old Dominion University professors, using data from 2008 and 2010. They found that 14 percent of noncitizens in the 2008 and 2010 samples said they were registered to vote.\n\nBut the researchers warned that \u201cit is impossible to tell for certain whether the noncitizens who responded to the survey were representative of the broader population of noncitizens.\u201d\n\nOne of the researchers, Jesse Richman, wrote about the Trump staff\u2019s use of his research. The results \u201csuggest that almost all elections in the US are not determined by noncitizen participation, with occasional and very rare potential exceptions,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s repeated claims, his attorneys stated there was no evidence of voter fraud in the 2016 election. In a court filing opposing Green Party candidate Jill Stein\u2019s recount petition, lawyers for Trump and his campaign wrote: \u201cAll available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake.\u201d\n\nWhen we debunked this claim on Nov. 29, 2016, we implored Trump\u2019s staff members to please drop this talking point \u2014 as we are tired of telling them it is false. We can\u2019t emphasize this point enough.\n\nThe Fact Checker Recidivism Watch tracks politicians who repeat claims that we have previously found to be incorrect or false.
