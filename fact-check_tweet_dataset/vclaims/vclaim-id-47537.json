The new coronavirus first emerged months after Epstein\u2019s death.\n\nEpstein, a financier and convicted sex offender, was found dead in his jail cell at Manhattan\u2019s Metropolitan Correctional Center from what officials deemed a suicide in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges, according to The New York Times. The circumstances surrounding his death remain the subject of unsubstantiated conspiracy theories.\n\nOne image shared on Facebook claims new autopsy reports suggest he actually died from COVID-19, the respiratory virus caused by the coronavirus currently sweeping the globe. The image shows a picture of Epstein with a breaking news chyron underneath that reads, \u201cNYT: Autopsy reports suggest Epstein most likely died from COVID-19.\u201d\n\nBut the Daily Caller News Foundation found no such report from The New York Times or any other media outlet. No evidence could be found to suggest the allegedly new autopsy report exist.

China first reported cases of the new virus to the World Health Organization in late December, months after Epstein\u2019s death, according to Business Insider.\n\nThe New York City medical examiner\u2019s office conducted an autopsy shortly after Epstein\u2019s death and concluded he hanged himself, according to The New York Times. While the autopsy results were later disputed by a pathologist hired by Epstein\u2019s brother, there is no indication that Epstein died from COVID-19.\n\nFake breaking news chyrons can easily be created using websites like breakyourownnews.com.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
