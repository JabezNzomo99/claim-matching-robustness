That was well before the British landed in North America,\" Kaine said Nov. 3. \"Spanish was the first European language spoken in this country.\"\n\nWe decided to follow Kaine on his history tour and wondered if he was right about the Spanish language\u2019s roots in the United States.\n\nThe United States does not have an official national language, yet 31 states have laws establishing English as their official tongue, according to the CIA World Factbook.\n\nEnglish is the dominant language across the states and Spanish the second-most common. Of about 291.5 million people, 5 years and older, an estimated 37.6 million speak Spanish at home, according to 2011 Census Bureau data (the latest we could find). Chinese follows, spoken by more than 2.8 million people.\n\nAnd while there is no definitive data, the Census Bureau estimates there are more than 300 languages spoken in the United States.\n\nLinguist experts we interviewed all agreed with Kaine, saying he was right about Spanish being the first European language spoken in the United States.\n\nIt all ties back to Florida.\n\nIn many textbooks that deal with the history of the Spanish language, there are statements similar to Kaine\u2019s, said Sonia Ram\u00edrez Wohlmuth, a senior instructor of world languages at the University of South Florida.\n\nShe referred us to page 211 of a textbook on language and linguistic diversity in the United States that says:\n\n\"Of the European explorers who reached North America during the Age of Discovery, the Spanish arrived first. ... Exploration of the Southeast began in 1513, when the first governor of Puerto Rico, Ponce de Le\u00f3n, arrived on the coast of Florida during his quest for the fountain of youth. This marked the first recorded presence of the Spanish on what would eventually be U.S. soil.\"\n\nIn the late 1520s, an expedition led by Spanish conquistador P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez landed near present-day Tampa Bay.\n\nBut it was a failure, because almost everyone was killed or died before they could report back, said Richard A. Rhodes, a linguistics professor at University of California, Berkeley.\n\nFounded in 1565, St. Augustine is regarded as the United States\u2019 oldest continuously occupied settlement of European origin. It was founded by Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s, a conquistador from Spain.\n\n\"Spanish was the first language spoken by conquistadors and settlers who founded St. Augustine (San Agust\u00edn in Spanish, after the saint),\" said Evelina Guzauskyte, an associate professor of Spanish at Wellesley College.\n\nThe British and the French did not arrive until later, and the Portuguese were occupying other lands, Guzauskyte said.\n\nThe Observatory of the Spanish Language and Hispanic Cultures in the United States at Harvard University also told us about an explorer (born in what\u2019s now Mexico to parents from Spain) who left an inscription in New Mexico in 1605, that says in Spanish: \"pas\u00f3 por aqu\u00ed el adelantado Juan de O\u00f1ate.\"\n\nArcheology Southwest translates the full inscription to: \"There passed this way the Adelantado (conqueror) Don Juan de O\u00f1ate from the discovering of the South Sea on the 16th of April 1605.\"\n\nThe first permanent English settlement in North America was in 1607 at Jamestown, Va. The Pilgrims arrived until 1620 in present-day Massachusetts.\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign highlighted a PBS post about the history of Spanish in the United States.\n\n\"Spanish actually antedates English in the areas that now make up the composite United States \u2014 a fact that surprises many Americans,\" says part of the post. \"In terms of continuity and longevity in the United States, the Spanish language is second only to Native American languages that were spoken for centuries prior to colonization.\"\n\nTim Kaine said, \"Spanish was the first European language spoken in this country.\"\n\nLinguistic experts tell us that\u2019s accurate. Even though English is the dominant language in the United States, the first permanent English settlement came 42 years after explorers from Spain founded St. Augustine in Florida. Their primary language was Spanish.", "lang": "en"}
