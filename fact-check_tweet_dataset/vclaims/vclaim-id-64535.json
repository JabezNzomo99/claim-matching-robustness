It\u2019s currently visible on Trump\u2019s Instagram page.\n\nThe post on Trump\u2019s account, and a similar one posted on his eldest daughter and adviser Ivanka\u2019s Twitter account, reflects a recent internet dust-up over the brand Goya. On July 9, 2020, Goya CEO Robert Unanue appeared at the White House and praised the president. This resulted in Trump\u2019s critics calling to boycott the Goya brand and an inevitable push by his supporters to buy Goya products.\n\nPresident Trump and Ivanka\u2019s bean posts also earned criticism from government ethics experts, who said that the product plugging violated anti-corruption rules. \u201cAs a pictorial representation of the Trump administration\u2019s war on government ethics, both photos are perfectly clear,\u201d wrote Walter Shaub, the former director of the U.S. Office of Governmental Ethics. \u201cThey scream \u2018the rules don\u2019t apply to us,\u2019 a central message of the Trump administration from the start.\u201d\n\nThe Trumps\u2019 posts also earned a clapback from U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York:\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s post, translated into English, reads, \u201cIf it\u2019s Trump, it has to be corrupt.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
