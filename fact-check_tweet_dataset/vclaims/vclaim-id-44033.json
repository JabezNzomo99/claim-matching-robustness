We pay for it,\" Woolery tweeted Jan. 17. \"1000 dollars. On average 52,000 Bucks, a year for BOOZE. Tax payer money.\"\n\nWe found zero evidence to back up this claim. Furthermore, the congresswoman doesn\u2019t drink, Pelosi\u2019s office said.\n\nWoolery\u2019s claim sounded strikingly similar to a previous statement we checked in 2010, in which onetime presidential candidate Michele Bachmann accused Pelosi of spending $100,000 on alcohol for flights \u2014 which we rated Pants on Fire.\n\nThe original source of Bachmann's allegation was a large collection of documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by Judicial Watch, a conservative group that litigates on public corruption and other issues. A spokesman for Woolery sent us the same set of documents when we asked for evidence.\n\nBut in neither case do they back up the speakers\u2019 assertions.\n\nIn a 2010 press release summarizing the findings, Judicial Watch wrote that \"the Speaker\u2019s military travel cost the United States Air Force $2,100,744.59 over a two-year period \u2014 $101,429.14 of which was for in-flight expenses, including food and alcohol.\" (This covered both domestic and international travel.)\n\nIn Bachmann's case, she cited a figure for alcohol expenditures that was close to a much larger number \u2014 $101,429 \u2014 for all non-plane costs of the trip. It\u2019s unclear how Woolery came up with his $52,000 annual figure. Neither is correct.\n\nPelosi\u2019s office told us in 2010 \u2014 and reiterated for this check \u2014 that she \"does not drink alcohol.\" An aide added that she no longer takes weekly flights via military aircraft, a once-common practice that has since been phased out. She now travels commercial between Washington and California.\n\nWoolery said, \"Nancy Pelosi's bill for alcohol on her flights from Washington to San Fran every week? We pay for it. 1000 dollars. On average 52,000 Bucks, a year for BOOZE. Tax payer money.\"\n\nWe couldn\u2019t find any evidence to support Woolery\u2019s claim, which was strikingly similar to a falsehood about Pelosi\u2019s bar tab from 2010 that we rated Pants on Fire. Furthermore, her office says that she doesn\u2019t drink.\n\nWe rate this Pants on Fire.\n\nUpdate: This report was updated shortly after publication to include a response from Woolery's spokesperson.", "lang": "en"}
