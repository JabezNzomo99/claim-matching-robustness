The video actually comes from a 2007 television miniseries called \u201cPandemic,\u201d starring \u201cSaved by the Bell\u201d and \u201cBeverly Hills, 90210\u201d star Tiffani Thiessen.\n\nThe fictional content was posted on YouTube by \u201cMovie Central\u201d in February 2020. The scene in question can be viewed around the 60:00 mark of \u201cpart 2\u201d:\n\n\u201cPandemic\u201d was filmed in 2007. It featured Thiessen and \u201c3rd Rock from the Sun\u201d star French Stewart. Here\u2019s a synopsis from Sonar Entertainment:\n\nWhat happens when the deadly strain of an unknown virus multiplies second by second, person by person? What happens when an entire city is put under a government sanctioned quarantine? What happens when the source of the virus is as elusive as the cure? What happens is a Pandemic. At the Center for Disease Control, epidemiologist Dr. Kayla Martin (Tiffani Thiessen, Beverly Hills 90210) and her partner Carl Ratner (French Stewart, 3rd Rock from the Sun) receive a frantic call from a flight attendant high above the Pacific. A nineteen-year-old male passenger, en route to Los Angeles from Australia, has died following a raging fever and violent convulsions. Vehemently concerned about the symptoms, Kayla orders all passengers quarantined upon their arrival at LAX\u2014a decision at odds with Mayor Richard Delasandro (Oscar and Golden Globe nominee Eric Roberts, Runaway Train) who suggests the only outbreak will be one of panic. The CDC considers the frightening possibilities\u2014the reality of the bird flu, the probability of a biological attack, or worse, a new virus they can\u2019t control.\n\nWhile this video does not show mass graves in Italy, it is true that the country was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nAt the time of this writing, more than 8,000 people had died as a result of the new coronavirus in Italy.", "lang": "en"}
