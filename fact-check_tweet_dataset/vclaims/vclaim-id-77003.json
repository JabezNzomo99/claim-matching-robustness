Martin O\u2019Malley, \"acknowledged that we are not better off than we were four years ago,\" Tennessee Republican Party Chairman Chris Devaney wrote in a posting on the party\u2019s web site on Sept. 4.\n\n \n\n To back up the claim, the party\u2019s state executive director, Adam Nickas, directed us to O\u2019Malley\u2019s Sept. 2, appearance on CBS News\u2019 \"Face the Nation.\" The program, moderated by Bob Schieffer, was broadcast live on the eve of the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C.\n\n \n\n Instead of paraphrasing the exchange in question, we\u2019ll let a transcript from that pertinent segment of the broadcast speak for itself:\n\n \n\n Schieffer: Can you honestly say that people are better off today than they were four years ago?\n\n \n\n O\u2019Malley: No, but that\u2019s not the question of this election. The question, without a doubt, we are not as well off as we were before George Bush brought us the Bush job losses, the Bush recession, the Bush deficits, the series of desert wars, charged for the first time to credit cards, the national credit card \u2026\n\n \n\n When Schieffer pointed out that Bush is not on the ballot, O\u2019Malley replied: \"Yeah. But we are making progress\" and are coming out of \"the deep, deep hole.\"\n\n \n\n O\u2019Malley\u2019s remarks lit up the web and the blogosphere. But the next day, he gave a different answer during a CNN panel discussion when moderator Soledad O\u2019Brien referenced his earlier response on \"Face the Nation.\"\n\n \n\n Again, here is a transcript of the pertinent exchange:\n\n \n\n O\u2019Malley: Here\u2019s the reality of our situation as a country. We are clearly better off as a country because we are now creating jobs rather than losing them.\n\n \n\n O\u2019Brien: But you said no \u2026\n\n \n\n O\u2019Malley: But Soledad, we have not recovered all that we lost in the Bush recession. That\u2019s why we need to continue to move forward. Is there anybody on this panel that thinks we\u2019ve recovered all that we lost in the Bush recession? I don\u2019t think anybody could say that. But clearly, we\u2019re moving forward. We\u2019re creating jobs. Unemployment is down. Job creation is up. And those positive movements would not have happened without the president\u2019s leadership.\n\n \n\n A few days later, on Friday, Sept. 7, O\u2019Malley appeared on MSNBC\u2019s \"Morning Joe\" and said he didn\u2019t mean to say that Americans were not better off when he made his earlier remarks.\n\n \n\n O\u2019Malley said he had been \"word-spliced\" on \"Face the Nation\" and that Americans are indeed doing better.\n\n \n\n \"Yes, of course we\u2019re doing better when America is creating jobs, and we are creating jobs,\" he said.\n\n \n\n He again said the United States has not recovered all of the jobs lost during the recession and insisted that is what he was talking about on \"Face the Nation.\"\n\n \n\n In fairness to Devaney, O\u2019Malley\u2019s appearance on \"Morning Joe\" happened three days after Devaney had posted his comments on the GOP web site. But O\u2019Malley\u2019s CNN appearance, in which he backed off of his earlier statement, came the day before Devaney had posted his comments.\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n During his \"Face the Nation\" appearance, O\u2019Malley did, in fact, say Americans are not better off than they were four years ago, but he made clear he felt this was the fault of the Bush administration, not Obama\u2019s. He further clarified his beliefs in a CNN interview the next day and in another television interview three days later. In those follow-up interviews, O\u2019Malley said that while not all jobs lost during the recession have been recovered, Americans are still better off because the country is creating jobs instead of losing them.\n\n \n\n Chairman Devaney correctly cited O\u2019Malley\u2019s original remarks but failed to mention that the governor had said the opposite in subsequent interviews. We understand that, especially in the hyper-partisan atmosphere surrounding a presidential election, politicos are going to cherry-pick comments that make their side look good and the other guy look bad. Still, we rate Devaney\u2019s claim as Half True.", "lang": "en"}
