Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a regular target for fabricated quotes that seem designed to make her look dumb. A new one surfaced on Facebook on March 30 that appears to quote the congresswoman arguing against daylight saving time.\n\n\"If we change our times with the sole intent of increasing the amount of daylight we receive, that\u2019s an extra hour of sun shine,\" reads the post, which is shared as an image. \"That\u2019s one extra hour per day of extra heat warming our already unstable planet. We need to repeal Daylight Savings Time as a primary measure to decrease the rate of climate change. Less hours of sun shine equal less heat hitting Earth\u2019s surface. We\u2019re running out of time!\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Some people commenting on the post seemed to believe Ocasio-Cortez said this.\n\n\"I know crackheads on the corner smarter,\" one person wrote.\n\n\"Another product of public education,\" said someone else, adding a face-palm emoji.\n\nBut the Facebook image also cites a story on the website NPC Daily that claims \"Daylight Savings Time is at odds with the Green New Deal,\" a resolution Ocasio-Cortez introduced in February outlining ideas to tackle climate change.\n\nHowever, NPC Daily is not real news.\n\n\"This entire website is satire and not meant to be taken seriously,\" according to the site.\n\nBut that\u2019s unclear from the Facebook post, which doesn\u2019t provide a link to the story.\n\nOver here in reality, some lawmakers have taken positions on daylight saving time. U.S. Sens. Marco Rubio and Rick Scott, for instance, recently introduced legislation that would make daylight saving time permanent across the country.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, meanwhile, tweeted about daylight saving time on March 8.\n\n\"PSA,\" she wrote, \"Daylight Savings is this weekend!\"\n\nShe was retweeting the New York City mayor\u2019s office, which reminded people that clocks skip ahead an hour and said: \"We\u2019re looking FORWARD to more sunshine in the evenings!\"\n\nWe rate this Facebook post as Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
