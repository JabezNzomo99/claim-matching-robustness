A tweet by @RealHistoriPix claims that the child was kidnapped and forced into beggary \u2013 \u201cThis beautiful child is not a beggar, she must be kidnapped and made to beg. Pls share her pic wherever you can so that it will reach to her parents.\u201d\n\nAnother Twitter user @hemirdesaiclaimed that the child was \u201cseen in Mangalore with Tamil beggars\u201d and was found in a Mumbai-bound train. \u201cHer name is Sonal Bipin Patel,\u201d the user alleged.\n\nThe same claim is also circulating with a Tamil text \u2013 \u201c\u0b85\u0bb4\u0b95\u0bbf\u0baf \u0baa\u0bc6\u0ba3\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bc1\u0bb4\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc8 \u0bae\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb2\u0bc2\u0bb0\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd \u0baa\u0bbf\u0b9a\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0bc8\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bcb\u0b9f \u0bb5\u0bb2\u0bae\u0bcd \u0bb5\u0beb\u0b95\u0bbf\u0bb1\u0ba4\u0bc1 \u0b87\u0ba4\u0bc8 \u0baa\u0bc6\u0bb1\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0bcb\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bb5\u0ba3\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb1\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0b9a\u0bca\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0bb2\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0bb5\u0bb0\u0bc8 \u0baa\u0bb2\u0beb\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0baa\u0b95\u0bbf\u0beb\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd. (The beautiful girl was seen in Mangalore with Tamil beggars pls forward until it reaches the right parent and she is identified. This is for the parent\u2019s attention.)\u201d\n\nThe images of the girl are also being forwarded on WhatsApp.\n\nThere are several clues in the photographs which led us to the conclusion that they are not from India but Bangladesh.\n\nIf one looks closely the currency notes in the girl\u2019s possession feature a portrait of Bangladesh\u2019s founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.\n\nA Google reverse-search of the images took us to several media reports from Bangladesh. A July 13, 2019 report in Ajker Comilla, based on a Facebook post by one Asif Akbar, the girl was kidnapped two years ago from a market in Bagerhat. A person recently clicked her photo in Banani, Dhaka. The uncle of the child recognised his niece and contacted the photographer. However, when the duo went back to the same place in Banani, the child was gone. The Facebook post further claimed that the girl\u2019s father works in Chittagong and does not use a mobile phone. \u201cIf anyone finds the child, please inform the police or the child\u2019s uncle,\u201d it appealed. The post ended with two phone numbers, one of which belonged to the uncle and the other one was Iqbal Kabir\u2019s number, the president of Bagarpara Upazila Press Club.\n\nAlt News contacted Kabir and was told that a girl was indeed kidnapped two years ago in Bagerhat. \u201cAfter this child\u2019s photographs were uploaded, the uncle of the kidnapped child claimed that this girl is his niece,\u201d Kabir informed, adding that they\u2019ve been unable to confirm if the child in the photographs is the same as the one who was kidnapped as they are yet to make contact with her parents. \u201cIt\u2019s been about 10 days that we are trying to get in touch with the parents. No one knows of their whereabouts,\u201d he informed.\n\nWe found another local report by WAB News24, according to which, a different family has recognised the child in the photographs as their own. Volunteers of the organisation, while searching for the girl, came across a person who claimed to have spotted her at Brahmanbaria railway station. Taking this as a lead, WAB claimed to have located the child\u2019s father, Abul Mia. Speaking to her family members and neighbours, WAB claimed that the girl in the pictures was Abul Mia\u2019s daughter and not the child who was kidnapped.\n\nWhen Alt News asked Iqbal Kabir about WAB\u2019s findings, we were told that it is possible that the kidnapped child is the daughter of Abul Mia who also begs for alms.\n\nPhotographs of a child from Bangladesh, whose identity is yet to be confirmed, are floating on social media as a girl who was taken away from her parents and forced to beg on Indian streets.", "lang": "en"}
