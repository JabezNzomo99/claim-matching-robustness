Chair, BU Researcher charged with concealing ties to China.\" It contained clips of Andrew Lelling, US Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, speaking at a press conference about Lieber's supposed arrest.\n\nLieber was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on January 28. According to the FBI, Lieber repeatedly lied about his participation in China's Thousand Talents Plan and his affiliation with the Wuhan University of Technology. He also did not disclose his acquisition of millions of dollars from the Chinese government for foreign research.\n\nMoreover, the news report attached to the post did not make any mention of the coronavirus. Instead, it only cited the charges against Lieber and two other Chinese, one of whom lied about her Chinese military service and another who attempted to smuggle vials of biological material back to China.\n\nFurthermore, scientists have concluded that the virus could not have been constructed in a laboratory. \"Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,\" said the authors of a research paper titled, \"The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2.\"\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
