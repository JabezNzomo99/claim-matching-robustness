Net debt reached more than A$350 billion in December 2017 (A$350,245m), and was above A$350 billion in January 2018 (A$353,359m) and March 2018 (A$350,717m). Also, on the government\u2019s own budget numbers, net debt for this financial year is A$349.9 billion (2018-19 Budget, BP1 3-16, Table 3). So whether you look at the government\u2019s Monthly Financial Statements or its budget, we\u2019ve had net debt double under this government.\n\nShadow minister for finance Jim Chalmers quoted his numbers (broadly) correctly when he said that \u201cunder the current government we have had net debt double\u201d.\n\nAs at July 1 2018, the budget estimate of net debt in Australia was about A$341.0 billion, up from A$174.5 billion in September 2013, when the Coalition took office. That\u2019s an increase of A$166.5 billion, or roughly 95%, over almost five years.\n\nTo put that in context, in Labor\u2019s last term (2007-13, a nearly six-year period that included the Global Financial Crisis), net debt rose by about A$197 billion \u2013 around A$30 billion more than has been the case under the current Coalition government.\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that over time, a government\u2019s debt position will reflect deficits (or surpluses) of past governments.\n\nGross debt is the total amount of money a government owes to other parties. Net debt is gross debt, adjusted for some of the assets a government owns and earns interest on.\n\nNot all government assets are included in the calculation of net debt. For example, the equity holdings of Australia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund \u2013 the Future Fund \u2013 are excluded.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that net debt doesn\u2019t give the full picture of a government\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nIf the government borrows A$1 (by issuing bonds) to buy A$1 worth of equity (investment in another asset), net debt will rise. That\u2019s because bond issuance (debt) will rise by A$1, without an accompanying increase in investments that pay interest.\n\nIn Australia\u2019s case, this distinction is relevant, because the government currently has about A$50 billion of investments in shares (which aren\u2019t considered interest-bearing for accounting purposes) and around A$50 billion in equity in public sector entities (like schools, hospitals and infrastructure).\n\nOver time, a government\u2019s debt position will reflect deficits of past governments, with budget deficits increasing the total debt, and surpluses reducing it.\n\nHas net debt doubled under the current government?\n\nThe chart below shows net debt for Australia from 2001-02 to 2018-19. The 2017-18 and 2018-19 numbers are estimates, but all earlier numbers are actual net debt numbers.\n\nAs you can see from the chart, net debt has risen under both Coalition and Labor governments since 2008.\n\nThe Department of Finance publishes Australian Government Monthly Financial Statements, which can be used to get a picture of net debt levels during election months.\n\nOn July 1 2007, in the final year of the Howard Coalition government, net debt was minus A$24.2 billion. The government\u2019s financial assets, such as those held in the Future Fund, were greater than government bonds on issuance, putting the government in a net asset (positive) position.\n\nAt the time of the election of the Labor government in November 2007, Australia\u2019s net debt position was still negative (at minus A$22.1 billion) \u2013 meaning the government held A$22.1 billion more than it owed. By July 1 2013, in the final months of the last Labor government, net debt had risen to A$159.6 billion.\n\nThe Liberal-National Coalition won the federal election on September 7 2013. At September 30, net debt was A$174.5 billion (meaning that net debt rose by about A$5 billion per month in the three months before the 2013 election).\n\nAs at July 1 2018, the budget estimate of net debt in Australia was about A$341.0 billion. That\u2019s roughly a 95% rise since the Coalition took office in 2013, making Chalmers\u2019 statement about net debt having doubled under the current government broadly correct.\n\nWhat can we take from this?\n\nIn terms of economic management, not a great deal.\n\nRather than being concerned about the level of debt, most economists would be concerned about the level of debt relative to gross domestic product (GDP), or the size of the population. On these measures, the rises in net debt under the current government have been less significant.\n\nIt rose from about 11.3% in September 2013 (when the Coalition was elected) to 18.3% in July 2016, at which point the ratio roughly stabilised. The net debt to GDP ratio now stands at 18.6% and is predicted to fall in the next few years.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that during Labor\u2019s most recent period of government, net debt rose by around A$197 billion \u2013 about A$30 billion more than has been the case under the current Coalition government.\n\nMy research on the effects of political parties in Australia on the economy found that, historically, economic growth and other important economic outcomes have had little to do with which party is in power. \u2013 Mark Crosby\n\nThe author has a done a very competent job in analysing Jim Chalmers\u2019 statement regarding net debt under the current government.\n\nWhat the analysis shows is how complex the issue is, and that the argument over which major party is the better economic manager cannot be encapsulated simply by one number.\n\nThe net debt figures can be interpreted in a number of different ways, pointing to different assessments of a particular government\u2019s economic management.\n\nAs the author notes, the net debt position depends not just on the current government\u2019s actions, but also on the legacy inherited from previous governments. That\u2019s because debt is used to finance borrowings, which are largely the result of previous governments\u2019 fiscal policies.\n\nAn assessment of a government\u2019s macro-economic management depends on analysis of several different factors, of which debt is only one. \u2013 Phil Lewis\n\nThe Conversation\u2019s FactCheck unit was the first fact-checking team in Australia and one of the first worldwide to be accredited by the International Fact-Checking Network, an alliance of fact-checkers hosted at the Poynter Institute in the US.
