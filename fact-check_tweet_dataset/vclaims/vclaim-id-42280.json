The headlines with almost all the news reports with this man's mugshot referred to him as a Pakistani terrorist captured by the Border Security Force personnel. The reports dated back to September of 2016.\n\nFrom the links shared above and other news reports, we found that the bearded man in the video is Abdul Qayyum. He was arrested in Akhnoor sector of Jammu and Kashmir on September 23, 2016.\n\nQayyum had admitted to training with the Lashkar-e-taiba in 2004 at Manshera training camp near Muzzafarabad, PoK.\n\nThe claims of Qayyum's RSS-connection made way into social media last year when his image, in custody of BSF personnel, started being circulated with a false narrative. There were also other posts which claimed that Qayyum had links with the Congress party.\n\nIn his confession Qayyum did admit of having links with LeT. However, there has been no mention of Qayyum's links with either RSS or Congress in any of the news reports.", "lang": "en"}
