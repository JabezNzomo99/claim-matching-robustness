This is false, the pictures do not depict a family and circulated online prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"Both his parent are infected with corona virus. Help him pray for recovery,\u201d said a March 28, 2020 post, which is no longer available but has been archived here. \u201cSpread and share with everyone please, prayers needed. I see no one sharing. If they were dead, everyone would share!\u201d\n\nMost of the comments on the post consisted of thoughts and prayers for the \u201cfamily.\u201d\n\nThe post, published on a Facebook page titled \u201cCoronavirus WorldWide,\u201d went through several edits, including a version that featured an image of a different boy.\n\nChanges were also made to the post\u2019s caption, its edit history shows.\n\nSimilar posts were shared on Facebook here and here.\n\nThe people in the pictures are not related, AFP found through several reverse image searches.\n\nThe picture of the man in a hospital bed shows Dylan Nelson of Burlington, Wisconsin. Nelson was hospitalized in 2019 for lung damage from vaping, according to various media reports.\n\nThe original image of the boy is a screenshot from a video published in March 2018. The clip shows the boy next to a toilet.\n\n\u201cHis mom tried to comfort him, but tears continued to stream down his face because he thought he lost his poop,\u201d the description under the video reads.\n\nThe image of the boy after the edit was made is also old and unrelated to the novel coronavirus epidemic. The photo was originally published in 2015 and was taken in Iraq.\n\nThe woman pictured in the posts is Maddie Nelson of Nephi, Utah, who told AFP on Facebook that she is not related to Dylan Nelson.\n\nShe said the photo was taken when she was hospitalized while suffering from lung problems after vaping.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked more than 220 examples of false or misleading information about the novel coronavirus.
