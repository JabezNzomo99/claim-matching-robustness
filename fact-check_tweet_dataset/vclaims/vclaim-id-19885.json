However, the idea that the images prove that the Pope enjoyed visiting Obama and other world leaders more than Trump doesn\u2019t hold water. The images shown above were chosen to paint Trump in a negative light. One could select other images, however, to illustrate the exact opposite. For example, here\u2019s an image showing the Pope smiling with President Trump next to an image of the Pope frowning with President Obama:\n\nFurthermore, Evan Vucci, the Associated Press photographer who took the viral photograph of Trump with a frowning Pope Francis, told TIME that although this particular image doesn\u2019t show the Pope smiling, he wasn\u2019t in an unusually bad mood during the photo-op:\n\nEvan Vucci, the Associated Press photographer who made this picture, recalled the rapidly unfolding scene in a phone call on Wednesday. \u201cIt happens so fast, like a pool spray at the White House,\u201d he tells TIME. Vucci was among six photographers who got into the room. The group was first ushered in to photograph Trump and Francis as they sat across from one another at a desk, then back out so the pair could meet. About a half hour later, they returned for more pictures. \u201cWe were instructed to stay behind the gift table. It\u2019s packed and everyone is jostling for position,\u201d Vucci says. \u201cThey\u2019re shaking hands, [Trump\u2019s] introducing the delegation. Then they do this big group photo.\u201d This is just one image, from one click of the shutter, during a moment when hundreds of pictures were made. For Vucci, a veteran political photojournalist, his work is all about honesty. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be as fair as possible, that\u2019s my job,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd where people take it, it\u2019s up to them.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Pope Francis truly did enjoy meeting President Obama more than President Trump (or vice versa). However, this viral comparison does not offer proof of any kind.", "lang": "en"}
