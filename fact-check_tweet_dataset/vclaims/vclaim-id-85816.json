The logo used in the flyer is of a Shia Islamist militant group and political party based in Lebanon called 'Hezbollah,' whereas the rate card lists the postal addresses of Popular Front of India (PFI) in Bangalore, Kozhikode, and Chennai. Additionally, BOOM had previously debunked the same rate card twice - once in 2017 when Times Now had falsely reported on it as a larger story about how Islamic terrorist group ISIS is converting Hindus in Kerala and then again in Feb 2020 when the clipping was viral.", "lang": "en"}
