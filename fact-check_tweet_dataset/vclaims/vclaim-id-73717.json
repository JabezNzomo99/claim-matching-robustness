No, that's not true: This is a doctored photo. In the original photo, Lemon was actually posing with his CNN colleague Chris Cuomo.\n\nThe claim appeared in a Facebook post (archived here) where it was published on August 16, 2020, with the caption:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nLemon and Cuomo, both CNN anchors, have been friends for a number of years, according to social media posts. Lemon posted the original photo to his instagram on July 23, 2020, which is from 2013 according to the caption.\n\nThis photo was doctored to feature Epstein's head instead of Cuomo's. The photo of Epstein that was incorporated into the original was taken by photographer Patrick McMullan in 2005, according to a fact-check on the same claim by checkyourfact.com.\n\nHere is the photo, from Getty Images:\n\nEpstein died in jail by suicide while awaiting federal sex trafficking charges in August of 2019. Epstein knew a number of famous and powerful people, some of whom have come under online scrutiny for appearing with Epstein in photos or by knowing him. Lemon is not one of them, however, because this is a doctored photo of Epstein and Lemon.", "lang": "en"}
