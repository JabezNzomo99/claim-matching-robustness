This is false; she was introducing Planned Parenthood\u2019s new program, \u201cTelehealth,\u201d which does not offer home abortions.\n\n\u201cJamie Lee Curtis Tells Women to Kill Their Babies in Abortions at Home in New Planned Parenthood Ad,\u201d the headline said, in reference to this video shared by the actress on Twitter.\n\n\u201cMaybe in 10 years, we\u2019ll have Daniel Craig guiding us through DIY euthanasia at home,\u201d the article on anti-abortion website LifeNews says.\n\nFacebook groups shared the article here and here.\n\nAt no point in the video does the actress mention abortion or tell women to \u201ckill their babies\u201d at home. Life News corrected the headline on May 21, 2020 after AFP published this fact check.\n\n\u201cI am here today on behalf of Planned Parenthood to tell you about Telehealth... It offers you to log on and make an appointment and, then, have a private one-on-one session with a trained and licensed healthcare professional and talk about your health care needs,\u201d she says in the video.\n\nThere is a link at the bottom of the video to the website of the Pasadena & San Gabriel Valley division of Planned Parenthood. The clinic is \u201ccurrently only accepting urgent visits\u201d for issues including sexually transmitted infection treatment, emergency contraception, and abortion.\n\nAll other visits are conducted via Telehealth with a medical provider, according to the website.\n\n\u201cWhile services vary from health center to health center, patients can access services\u201d including birth control, sexually-transmitted infection testing and urinary tract infection screening, Dr. Krishna Upadhya, Senior Medical Advisor at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, told AFP via email.\n\n\u201cSome health centers also offer counseling and follow-up for abortion services through Telehealth,\u201d she said.\n\nMany states in the US require several in-person visits to a clinic to get an abortion.\n\nAnd the drug Mifeprex, used together with misoprostol to end an early pregnancy, \u201cmay only be dispensed in clinics, medical offices, and hospitals by or under the supervision of a certified healthcare provider,\u201d according to the FDA.", "lang": "en"}
