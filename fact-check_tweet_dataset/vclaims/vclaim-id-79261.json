No, they moved them here \u201315-20 minutes flying time to our territory,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs commander-in-chief, this is a question for me. Eighteen aircraft. It is not clear what they were carrying. Maybe nuclear weapons. I proceed from the worst-case scenario. Therefore, I had to react.\"\n\nThere is no evidence of a NATO military buildup along the borders of Belarus. Lukashenko also made the claim earlier, on Aug. 16, and NATO denied it.\n\nSince the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, NATO has maintained several multinational battlegroups spread out over Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, totaling about 5,000 troops.\n\nBy comparison, the Belarusian military boasts 45,000 active duty troops, 29,000 of whom belong to its ground forces.\n\nNor has any NATO country threatened military action against Belarus. Some have enacted targeted sanctions against Belarus over its Aug. 9 presidential election. The U.S., EU officials and Lukashenko\u2019s opponents all say the vote was neither free nor fair, and they\u2019ve condemned Lukashenko\u2019s heavy-handed crackdown on protests.\n\nOn Aug. 31, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia imposed travel bans on Lukashenko and 29 other Belarusian government officials.\n\nLukashenko, who has served five presidential terms since 1994, claimed he won 80 percent of the vote in the Aug. 9 election. That sparked mass rallies that continue in the capital of Minsk and across the country.\n\nThe unrest has claimed two lives, including that of an unarmed man shot in the chest, apparently by riot police. More than 7,000 people have been detained, and some have described beatings and torture while in custody. These claims have been corroborated by photographs showing severe bruising on prisoners\u2019 bodies.\n\nLukashenko\u2019s ally Russia has kept its distance, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov telling journalists on Aug. 19 that, \u201cBelarusians will iron out their own problems.\u201d\n\nHowever, Russian President Vladimir Putin, said he had created a \u201cpolice reserve\u201d at the behest of Lukashenko, ostensibly to be used in Belarus if the situation goes \u201cout of control.\u201d So far, there is no evidence Russian forces have intervened.\n\nWorkers at Belteleradio, Belarus\u2019 state TV and radio service, walked off the job on Aug. 17 in solidarity with the nationwide protests. Since then, Russian employees of RT (Russia Today), the Russian state-owned media outlet, have reportedly been filling in.\n\nThe Russian news outlet RBC reported that Belteleradio had been using RT material on-air since Aug. 27. An RT employee in Belarus denied that report.", "lang": "en"}
