Below is a tweet by Shefali Vaidya which says, \u201c\u2026Jamia girls who GLOATED on the death of our soldiers in the Pulwama attack!\u201d\n\n@RealHistoriPix also made the same claim.\n\n@India_Policywrote, \u201cThe Hero of Indian Media, particularity @bdutt. Celebrating the massacre of Pulwama (that list is of the martyrs of Pulwama).\u201d His tweet was retweeted over 3,000 times.\n\nRenna has emerged as a prominent name in the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act after a video of her standing up against Delhi police went viral. Many on Facebook have also shared the screenshot of the alleged tweet.\n\nThere are several clues in the screenshot which hint at its falseness. For one, her name is spelt incorrectly. The screenshot says \u201cAyesha Reena\u201d while the Jamia student protester\u2019s name is \u201cAysha Renna.\u201d\n\nRenna had also called out the misinformation on Twitter and clarified that her only active ID is \u2018@AyshaRenna\u2018.\n\nThe username was earlier @drjamidullah_ which he later changed to impersonate Renna.\n\nTherefore, a screenshot of an old tweet made by a man from Kashmir impersonating Aysha Renna has been widely shared with the false claim that the Jamia Milia student celebrated the Pulwama attack.", "lang": "en"}
