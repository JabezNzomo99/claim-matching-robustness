Let\u2019s analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Image of a man disguised as woman, caught at the Shaheen Bagh protests. Fact: The image is that of a militant who was caught by the Jammu & Kashmir Police for opening fire in a market in Pulwama in 2015. So, the image is no way related to the ongoing Shaheen Bagh protest against CAA. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWith reverse image search, the same image was found in an article of \u2018Deccan Herald\u2019 mentioning that some burqa-clad militants had opened fire at a market in Pulwama in 2015. Police had confronted them and arrested a suspected militant wearing a burqa to disguise himself as a woman. The image can also be seen in the article of \u2018Greater Kashmir\u2019 which reported this incident.\n\nTo sum it up, image from 2015 is falsely shared as \u2013 \u2018Man disguised as a woman caught at the Shaheen Bagh protest\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
