In the post, it is alleged that Modi was also present in the photo along with Indira Gandhi. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claims made in the post.\n\nClaim: Modi was present in the photograph of Indira Gandhi. Fact: The original photo was clicked when Indira Gandhi met Kannada hero Raj Kumar at an event organized by Sangeetha Music. This photo was edited to replace some unknown person\u2019s face with that of Modi\u2019s. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image in the post is run through Google Reverse Image Search technique, it was found in an article of \u2018The Quint\u2019 with the title \u201cKarnataka\u2019s Reluctant Politician: The Life and Times of Annavaru\u201d. From the information available in the article, it was found that the original photo was taken when Indira Gandhi met actor Raj Kumar at a Sangeetha Music event. This photo is edited by replacing some unknown person\u2019s face in it with that of Modi\u2019s, to mislead people.\n\nTo conclude, the photo of Modi seen along with Indira Gandhi and Raj Kumar is a work of Photoshop.", "lang": "en"}
