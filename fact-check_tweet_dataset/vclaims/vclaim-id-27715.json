The claim is false; Sri Lanka\u2019s Immigration Department has introduced a free visa scheme to boost tourism but for 48 designated countries -- not for a specific religious or ethnic group -- and the initiative only runs until January 2020.\n\nThe photo and misleading claim were published in this Facebook post on September 2, 2019. The post has been shared more than 3800 times.\n\nThe post contains a photograph of a street in Colombo crowded with men and women in Islamic dress typically worn by the Bohra Muslim minority group.\n\nThe text across the top of the image says: \u201cThe government comes forward to uplift the tourism industry. Free visa for Bohra Muslims until 2025\u201d.\n\nBohras are a sect of Muslims, with an estimated population of about one million people, including a small community in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe misleading Facebook post\u2019s Sinhala-language caption translates to English as: \u201cNot sure what to say\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe same image has also been shared here on Facebook with a caption which states: \u201cCabinet approval was given today to grant free visa for Bora Muslims up to year 2025 to visit Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the Bora Muslims who come to Sri Lanka will be able to remain in this country for another five years until the year 2025. The government has taken this step to promote Sri Lanka's tourism industry.\u201d\n\nThe same image was also shared with a similar claim here on Facebook.\n\nThe claim is false; Sri Lanka\u2019s government has not granted free visas to Bohra Muslims until 2025.\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s Immigration and Emigration Department told AFP the government had not taken any measures to introduce a free visa scheme for Bohra Muslims.\n\n\u201cThere is no truth to the claim that the government has implemented a free visa scheme for Bohra Muslims. Electronic Travel Authorizations have been granted for the visitors who travelled to Sri Lanka for the Bohra conference,\u201d spokesman B.G.G. Milinda told AFP by phone on September 4, 2019.\n\nA Bohra Muslim conference opened September 1, 2019 in Colombo, according to Facebook posts and local media reports.\n\nMilinda told AFP that the Bohras who have travelled to Sri Lanka for the Conference were in the country on Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) that would expire in 30 days.\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s free visa scheme was introduced on August 1, 2019 and runs until January 31, 2020. It covers 48 designated countries, according to the official post about the scheme here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the list of designated countries eligible for free visa:\n\n\u201cThe free visa scheme is not targeting a specific religious group or a community - only designated countries. But if a Bohra who travelled to Sri Lanka was a national of a designated country, their visa fee was waived,\u201d Milinda said.\n\nThe Colombo Dawoodi Bohra community told AFP that community members who visited Sri Lanka for the conference were only granted a 30-day ETA Tourist visa.\n\n\u201cAll visitors to the Dawoodi Bohra convention of Ashara Mubaraka have been issued a regular ETA tourist visa for 30 days,\u201d they said in an email on September 5, 2019.\n\nVisitors for the conference arrived from countries including India, Australia, UAE, USA and the UK -- some of which were eligible for free visas.\n\nThe image used in the misleading post has been taken from an album uploaded to the Dawoodi Bohra official Facebook page published on September 1, 2019, which can be seen here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the misleading post (L) and the image from the Facebook page (R ):\n\nThe Government welcomed Bohra Muslim conference as a move that would help revive the tourism industry hard-hit after Easter Sunday bombings.\n\nThe 2019 Easter Sunday bombings have adversely affected Sri Lanka\u2019s tourism industry, according to an AFP report published here.\n\nThe image used in the misleading Facebook post was Station Road in Colombo 04, as seen below in the screenshot comparison below:", "lang": "en"}
