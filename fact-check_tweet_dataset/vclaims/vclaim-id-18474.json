Elijah Cummings \u201cwrote a bill to keep all of Obama\u2019s record sealed.\u201d That distorts bipartisan legislation dealing with the federal records of all presidents that Cummings introduced, which became law in 2014.\n\nA false claim about Rep. Elijah Cummings has circulated on social media in recent days, following President Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter attack on the Maryland Democrat.\n\nThe claim, spread through a popular meme, posits that \u201cCummings wrote a bill to keep all of Obama\u2019s record (sic) sealed.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he insists that Congress must see all of President Trump\u2019s financial records,\u201d it continues.\n\nCummings \u2014 who heads the House Oversight Committee, which has been probing the Trump White House \u2014 did indeed sponsor a bill introduced in 2013, and signed by President Barack Obama in 2014, that dealt with presidential records. But it did not \u201ckeep all of\u201d Obama\u2019s records \u201csealed,\u201d and the provisions applied to all presidents\u2019 records \u2014 including Trump\u2019s \u2014 not just those of the Obama White House.\n\nThe bill \u2014 the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014 \u2014 made updates to the Presidential Records Act and to the Federal Records Act.\n\nAmong the amendments, the bill requires that the U.S. Archivist \u201cpromptly provide notice\u201d in writing to a former president when deciding to publicly disclose records of that president that were not previously publicly available; the incumbent president and the public also must be notified. The Archivist must then make such records public within 60 days, but is prohibited from doing so if the president in question claims a constitutional privilege over the material \u2014 unless the incumbent president withdraws that privilege or a final court order directs otherwise.\n\nThe Presidential Records Act defines \u201cpresidential records\u201d as \u201cdocumentary materials\u201d \u2014 such as books, correspondence, memos, documents, photographs and more \u2014 created or received by the president, immediate staff and others \u201cin the course of conducting activities which relate to or have an effect upon the carrying out of the constitutional, statutory, or other official or ceremonial duties of the President.\u201d\n\nMany open-government and historical associations supported the legislation, noting that it created specific time limitations for former and current presidents to object to the disclosure of certain records \u2014 and that it made changes to reflect modern-day records realities.\n\nFor example, it redefined federal \u201crecords\u201d to include \u201call recorded information, regardless of form or characteristics\u201d (therefore including electronic material) and restricted the president, vice president and others in federal government from using non-official email accounts for government business unless they copy or forward the records to their official accounts.\n\nThe measure received overwhelming bipartisan support at a time of gridlock in Washington: It passed the Republican-led House 420-0 and was then approved, with amendments, by the Democrat-controlled Senate by unanimous consent.\n\nMedia outlets at the time noted that Obama had been silent on the legislation before signing it.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
