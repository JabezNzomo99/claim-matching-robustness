No, that's not exactly true. Ahmed Hamdane Mahmoud Ayach El Aswadi posed as a refugee when he arrived in France in the summer of 2016. He was granted refugee status in June 2017, shortly after Emmanuel Macron took office in May 2017. The President of France does not personally decide every individual asylum case and even if he did it he would not have known about El Aswadi's past at the time.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by YourNewsWire on June 14, 2018 titled \"President Macron Grants ISIS Chief Political Asylum In France\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has granted an ISIS chief, responsible for the deaths of thousands of people, political asylum in France. Ahmed Hamdane Mahmoud Ayach El Aswadi has been allowed to enter France without fear of arrest, despite the fact that he took part in the 2014 slaughter of 1,700 soldiers in the northern Iraqi town of Tikrit. Express.co.uk reports: Videos and images of the unarmed cadets being beheaded, shot and choked before being dumped into unmarked graves were posted online by the jihadists, and quickly came to symbolise ISIS' senseless brutality.\n\nThe article is typical for YourNewsWire: the site usually takes one or more existing news reports and then adds some untrue or misleading facts to the headline and/or the first paragraph to make it more inflammatory so people will click and share it without thinking. In this case the real news article comes from Express:\n\nIt notes the ISIS chief posed as a refugee and France initially granted him asylum. But once Iraq sent word through Interpol about his real identity the man was arrested and locked up and his refugee status was revoked. As Express noted:\n\nThe fact that such a man could evade detection for quite a long period of time is still bad and cause for alarm but implying via the headline that Macron knowingly had a hand in it is quite stretching the truth.\n\nYourNewsWire has published several hoaxes and fake news articles in the past so anything they write or publish should be taken with a large grain of salt. Their Facebook page \"The People's Voice\" recently lost its verification checkmark according to a report from MMFA.\n\nThe Terms of Use of the site also make it clear they don't really stand behind the accuracy of any of their reporting:\n\nThe site was profiled in the Hollywood reporter where it was described as:\n\nRationalWiki described it as:\n\nA while ago we also reported that YourNewsWire had rebranded itself as NewsPunch by changing its domain name in an apparent effort to evade filtering/blocking. It appears the site has changed back to it's old name in the mean time but you can still see the NewsPunch name in the contact email address in the footer.\n\nWe wrote about yournewswire.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Evidence Anthony Bourdain Was Killed By Clinton Operatives\n\u2022 Fake News: Melinda Gates Did NOT Say We Must Discriminate Against All White People\n\u2022 Fake News: Pope Francis Did NOT Order White Women To Breed With Muslims\n\u2022 Fake News: Trump NOT Set To Legalize Medical Marijuana In All 50 States", "lang": "en"}
