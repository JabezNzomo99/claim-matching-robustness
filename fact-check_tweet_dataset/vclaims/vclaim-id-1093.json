Some of these claims include Soros being a former Nazi, Soros \u201cswearing to destroy the U.S.A.\u201d, Soros owning ANTIFA and Black Lives Matter, and Soros paying for protesters. Examples can be seen here and here.\n\nGeorge Soros is a billionaire philanthropist and founder of Open Society Foundations. He has been the target of multiple conspiracy theories and misinformation on social media (here). Previous Reuters fact checks debunking claims about Soros can be found here and here.\n\nOpen Society Foundations told Reuters via email that the claims made toward Soros in these posts are \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201cdo a disservice to the very bedrock of our democracy, as enshrined in the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nSOROS IS NOT A FORMER NAZI\n\nReuters debunked a false claim that a photograph shows a young Soros in a Nazi uniform (here). During the time Nazis were active, Soros would not have met the age requirements to be in the Schutzstaffel. Soros and his family were Hungarian Jews who lived in Budapest during the war, disguising their identities for safety. In 1947 at the age of 17, Soros moved to London to attend university (more here).\n\nBy the time Soros was 17, the fall of Nazi Germany had already happened. Soros could not possibly have been involved in the Nazi party which was active between 1920-1945. He is also a Hungarian Jew, further disproving this theory. In a 1998 60 Minutes interview (youtu.be/AiqHiQYuoOs) Soros says his father forged his family\u2019s identity to protect them. Soros, as a teenager, was placed under custody of a government official with the premise of being his godson. During this time, Soros witnessed (but did not actively participate in) the confiscation of Jewish property (here). In the interview, Soros says he doesn\u2019t feel guilt looking back at these events, mentioning that he was a child at the time and that he was a \u201cspectator\u201d to something that would have happened regardless of his presence.\n\nSOROS NEVER SWORE TO \u201cDESTROY THE USA\u201d\n\nReuters found no evidence of Soros ever saying this. Other fact checkers have also debunked this specific \u201cquote\u201d (here, here).\n\nAn older version of the quote attributes it to a Newsweek interview but there is no evidence Soros said this in their archive. One article quotes Steve Bannon comparing politics to war, saying, \u201cThey fight, look at [George] Soros and these other NGOs...they destroy you.\u201d The article also states that, according to Bannon, Soros threatened to \u201cdestroy him personally.\u201d (here).\n\nSOROS DOES NOT \u201cOWN\u201d ANTIFA AND BLACK LIVES MATTER\n\nGeorge Soros does not \u201cown\u201d ANTIFA or Black Lives Matter.\n\nA spokesperson for Open Society Foundations told Reuters via email: \u201cWe proudly support organizations that promote civic engagement and champion the right of all Americans to petition their government for redress of grievances. Those protesting the death of Mr. Floyd and police brutality across the nation do so out of a deep and abiding concern for country; they don\u2019t do so for pay from these foundations or any other, as some cynics claim.\u201d\n\nBlack Lives Matter is a largely horizontal, grassroots, global organization (https:// bit.ly/373z22H). Its co-founders, Opal Tometi, Patrisse Cullors, and Alicia Garza started the movement in 2013, after the death of Trayvon Martin. The co-founders recently told the New Yorker that Black Lives Matter \u201chas always been somewhat decentralized\u201d and operates in a horizontal manner: \u201cWe have always said the power goes on in the local chapter because they know what is going on\u201d.\n\nThe organization recently set up a $12 million grant to help organizations fighting institutional racism, after an upsurge in donations amid the current protests. Beyonc\u00e9 and Prince are among the celebrities who have donated to Black Lives Matter in previous years (here).\n\nOpen Society Foundations donates to groups worldwide (here). Some of their previous donations - including to Black Lives Matter and Planned Parenthood - have been subject to controversy in the U.S. (here, here). It is unclear if the foundation has donated to Black Lives Matter again in the last month.\n\nAntifa, short for \u201canti-fascist,\u201d is an amorphous movement whose adherents oppose people or groups they consider authoritarian or racist, often using aggressive tactics, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which monitors extremists (here). Horizontal in nature and largely lacking official organization, it is unclear how Antifa is funded, if at all ( here ).\n\nSOROS DID NOT PAY FOR PROTESTERS AFTER TRUMP\u2019S ELECTION\n\nFollowing Trump\u2019s 2016 election win, some far-right claims suggested actors including Soros funded the \u2018Not My President\u2019 protests. Open Society Foundations denied paying these protesters in any way (here, here).\n\nSoros has been mistakenly accused of sponsoring protests after Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court appointment and protests against racism in Ferguson, Missouri (here, here).\n\nOpen Society Foundations recently explained in a tweet: \u201cWe do not pay protesters. Neither does our founder George Soros. Claims that we do serve to delegitimize those who are exercising their Constitutionally-protected right to protest peacefully and petition their government for redress of grievances.\u201d (here)\n\nFalse. Conspiracy theories about George Soros visible in this post are unfounded.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
