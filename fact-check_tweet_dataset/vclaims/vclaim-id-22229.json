Before Trump brought it up in the State of the Union, he claimed that MS-13 had \u201cinfiltrated our schools\u201d (April 29); that authorities had removed \u201c50 percent\u201d of MS-13 members in the United States, or 6,000 of them (June 29); and that \u201cwe\u2019re throwing them out so fast; they never got thrown out of anything like this\u201d (Aug. 22). Trump signed an executive order in February 2017 that prioritizes law enforcement efforts against \u201ctransnational criminal organizations,\u201d a designation that includes MS-13.\n\nBut first, two important caveats: No U.S. agency reports how many MS-13 members are deported by the United States each year. Similarly, there is no nationwide database of MS-13 members imprisoned at the state or local levels, where the vast majority of crimes are prosecuted. (There are some figures for total gang convictions at the federal level, but they\u2019re not broken down by specific gang.)\n\nWith that in mind, we\u2019re going to dispense with the formalities and say that there\u2019s no way to verify Trump\u2019s latest claims based on the data \u2014 because there are no reliable data. Instead, we\u2019re going to evaluate some related information to see whether the president\u2019s claim could be accurate, at least in theory.\n\nThere\u2019s no breakdown of those 8,100 arrests that shows how many were of U.S. citizens or how many predated Trump. But in May, ICE was reporting 7,300 MS-13 arrests since 2005, so we could assume an additional 800 members or associates of MS-13 were arrested from May to November.\n\n\u201cWhile ICE does not track gang removals by specific gang, ICE does specifically target MS-13 members for arrest and removal on the basis of their immigration violations, enabling these public safety threats to be removed from the communities they are victimizing and returned to their home countries,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThese removals include foreign fugitives who are wanted for crimes committed abroad and are removable under U.S. immigration law.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
