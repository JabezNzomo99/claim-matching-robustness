Other cases cited either had not yet been filed or had been closed.\n\nThe largest donation was $2,500 from attorney Howard Sicula in June 2017. He had a wrongful death case pending in Dallet\u2019s court at the time.\n\nNow to the thrust of the GOP\u2019s claim.\n\nThe billboard refers viewers to an anti-Dallet state GOP website. It cites comments Dallet made at a Jan. 22, 2018 Federalist Society Supreme Court debate.\n\nDallet began by saying: \"So, I do recuse myself when there is any appearance that it\u2019s not going to be fair.\"\n\nThe GOP contends that statement means Dallet is a hypocrite because she took campaign contributions from lawyers who had cases before her.\n\nBut the rest of Dallet\u2019s statement makes it clear she didn\u2019t pledge not to take campaign contributions from lawyers, but rather that she would recuse herself from cases in which her husband\u2019s law firm was involved. She also drew a contrast with the first campaign of state Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman, who decided not to seek reelection.\n\nHere\u2019s the rest of Dallet\u2019s statement during the debate:\n\nMy husband works for Husch Blackwell, a larger firm, and I made the decision to remove myself from any case that they handle. That is not required by our ethics rules \u2026 but I decided that the better course of action, so that it is fair to everyone involved, is to just recuse myself from all those cases \u2026.\n\nThis is not about contributions from attorneys to our campaigns; that is allowed by our ethics rules. And certainly if it was an extreme amount, that would be something that the judge would have to look at.\n\nWhat we\u2019re talking about with our recusal rules, that is the issue that I\u2019ve been talking about, is the fact that when a party is in front of the case (judge) and that party has spent money -- significant amount of money, massive amounts of money, like the $2.25 million spent on Justice Gableman\u2019s campaign -- how can anyone look at that and think that that\u2019s fair?\n\nDallet also referred to recusing herself from cases involving her husband\u2019s firm in January 2018 at a candidates event and in an interview.\n\nAlthough it does not bear on the rating of this fact check, it\u2019s worth noting that the Wisconsin State Journal reported in early March 2018 that Dallet presided over at least one case involving attorneys from her husband\u2019s law firm; and that Dallet recused herself from three recent cases on her docket involving attorneys from the firm after being asked about them by the newspaper.\n\nThe state Republican Party says Dallet is a \"hypocrite\" because she \"took money from attorneys with over 100 cases before her.\"\n\nDallet has received campaign donations from lawyers who had cases in her court -- something that is common in judicial campaigns and allowed by state judicial ethics rules.\n\nBut on the hypocrite part of the GOP\u2019s statement, Dallet did not pledge that she would not accept contributions from lawyers who had cases before her. Rather, her pledge was to recuse herself from cases in which her husband\u2019s law firm was involved.\n\nFor a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
