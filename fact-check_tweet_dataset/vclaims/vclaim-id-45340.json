Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Karnataka State government has added the life story of the President of Janasena party and Tollywood Movie actor, Pawan Kalyan as a lesson in the 10th class English textbook. Fact: Karnataka State government has not added Pawan Kalyan\u2019s life story as a lesson in the 10th class English book. The page which has Pawan Kalyan\u2019s photo is taken from a 5th class English book called \u2018Together with Expressions English Multiskill Coursebook\u2019 by \u2018RachnaSagar\u2019 publications. However, the book doesn\u2019t have any lesson about Pawan Kalyan\u2019s life. Even Pawan Kalyan\u2019s name is not mentioned in the book. In a lesson titled \u2018Movie Making\u2019, the book included a photo of Pawan Kalyan holding a movie clap just as a representational image. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched on the internet about the information shared in the post, no information about Karnataka State government\u2019s inclusion of Pawan Kalyan\u2019s life story as a lesson in the 10th class English book was found. Also, when searched in the 10th class English book related to Karnataka state syllabus, no details related to Pawan Kalyan were found.\n\nIn the posted video, a page with Pawan Kalyan photo can be seen. When searched on Google using the words from that page, it was found that a school from Bhopal uploaded that book on their website. However, currently, the school\u2019s website is not functioning. Through the information available on Google cache of this page, the names of chapters in the book were found. From that information, when searched on Google, it was found that a school in Haryana had uploaded full details about that book on their website.\n\nBased on that information, we came to know that the page with Pawan Kalyan\u2019s photo was taken from a 5th class book called \u2018Together with Expressions English Multiskill Coursebook\u2019 by \u2018RachnaSagar\u2019 publications. However, the book doesn\u2019t have any lesson about Pawan Kalyan\u2019s life story. Even Pawan Kalyan\u2019s name is not mentioned in the book. In a lesson named- \u2018Movie Making\u2019, the book included a photo of Pawan Kalyan holding a \u2018movie clap\u2019 with the caption \u2018Taking a \u2018take\u2019 of a scene\u2019. This picture is just used as a representational image to indicate how a \u2018take\u2019 is captured.\n\nTo sum it up, Karnataka State government has not included Pawan Kalyan\u2019s life story as a lesson in the 10th class English book. His picture is included in a \u2018Movie Making\u2019 lesson of a 5th class textbook as a representational image of \u2018take\u2019 captured during a shoot.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
