Rowling tweeted, \u201cHermione Granger was black,\u201d and referred to the fictional character as \u201cmy n****.\u201d\n\nThe page posted a doctored image to Facebook. The character of Hermione Granger is portrayed by a black actress in the play \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child,\u201d a casting decision defended by Rowling.\n\nThe post shows two tweets, the first of which is dated April 3; in the image, Rowling allegedly uses a slur, justifying its use by saying that Granger, a character from the Harry Potter series, gave her \u201cthe N-word pass.\u201d\n\nHowever, Rowling has so far not sent any tweets in April, and The Daily Caller found no evidence that she deleted the tweets. (As they say, the internet never forgets, and an enterprising reporter would have likely taken a screenshot or archived the tweets fairly quickly.)\n\n\u201cWe can confirm the Tweet has been doctored and is fake,\u201d Nicky Stonehill of StonehillSalt PR, the consultancy that manages Rowling\u2019s profile, told the Caller in an email.\n\nFake Rowling quotes have become a meme in and of themselves, based on Rowling\u2019s tendency to share previously unknown, and sometimes unsolicited, details about her characters in interviews and online.\n\nThe fake tweets address a controversy that occurred when the cast of \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child,\u201d a play by director John Tiffany, playwright Jack Thorne and Rowling, was announced.\n\nAt the end of 2015, producers revealed that actress Noma Dumezweni would play Granger in the London production. Dumezweni was born in Swaziland and later grew up in Suffolk. The announcement received backlash from some fans who pointed out that Hermione was played by white actress Emma Watson in the Harry Potter films.\n\nRowling pushed back against the criticism and supported Dumezweni\u2019s casting.\n\n\u201cCanon: brown eyes, frizzy hair and very clever. White skin was never specified. Rowling loves black Hermione,\u201d she tweeted in December 2015.\n\nOne user pointed out a line from the third novel in which Hermione\u2019s face is described as \u201cwhite.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had a bunch of racists telling me that because Hermione \u2018turned white\u2019 \u2013 that is, lost [color] from her face after a shock \u2013 that she must be a white woman, which I have a great deal of difficulty with,\u201d Rowling told The Observer. \u201cBut I decided not to get too agitated about it and simply state quite firmly that Hermione can be a black woman with my absolute blessing and enthusiasm.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe found the best actress and she\u2019s black. Bye bye, now,\u201d Rowling told a Twitter user who asked why the producers couldn\u2019t find a \u201ceven a good white actress.\u201d\n\nThe play has since made its way to Broadway, with \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child\u201d winning the Tony Award for best play in 2018. Dumezweni was nominated for best featured actress in a play but lost to Laurie Metcalf.", "lang": "en"}
