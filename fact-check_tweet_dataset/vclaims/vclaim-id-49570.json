Several netizens have also called the clip fake on account of the tweet by Gonda police.\n\nA fact-check shows that there are two separate videos, one which shows the protesters chanting 'Hindustan Murdabad' while another which shows them saying 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai'. Both videos were not shot at the exact same location as protesters can be seen walking in the video.\n\nA close look at the first video reveals that the man standing second from left (in the video) says Murdabad when another man shouts Hindustan. When he is corrected by the person standing next to him, he giggles. Following which someone from the group signals to stop recording.\n\nGonda police has issued a denial from its official Twitter handle calling news reports about the video misleading and say the video was being spread with a false narrative online.\n\nThey also tweeted a second video separate from the one that went viral where protesters can be heard raising anti-Pakistan and pro-India slogans.\n\nBOOM reached out to the Gonda SP office to verify the video. The PRO on duty told us that the incident was nothing but a misunderstanding among the group members. When we asked him if any action was initiated against those involved, he said there's no offence committed and thus no action was initiated.\n\nIn its notice issued regarding the incident, the police department has mentioned that 'the news was being spread with a false narrative'.\n\nHindi daily Dainik Jagran also reported the incident. The article can be accessed here.\n\nJagran, in its article, reports 'interestingly, the cops gave the accused a clean chit without conducting any technical examination or consulting experts in the matter.No case was registered.'

Interestingly, Bholendra denied any links with the slognaeering youth. \"I checked it with the VHP members there (Gonda). The video is true but the youngsters seen shouting the slogans do not belong to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. I have informed the administration in this regard. We did organize protests over the Pulwama incident but that was on February 15,\" Bholendra told BOOM.", "lang": "en"}
