Rappler was able to keep a copy before it was taken down.\n\nThe facts: Santa Catalina School\u2019s assistant head of school John Aim\u00e9 told Rappler that Marcos did not graduate from the institution. This means she cannot be class valedictorian either.\n\n\u201cWhile the student you inquired about attended our school for a brief period in the fall of 1972, she is not a graduate,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked if any reasons were given for Marcos' departure from the school, Aim\u00e9 said Santa Catalina School does \"not discuss student records without the permission of the student.\"\n\nRappler then tried to verify with ISM if Marcos had finished her secondary education there. ISM was the school listed in Princeton University\u2019s records as the one Marcos had attended before she pursued the course on religion and politics at the American university for a couple of months between 1973 and 1979.\n\n\u201cIS Manila follows a very strict Data Privacy Policy and we unfortunately do not provide information about our Faculty, Staff, Students and Alumni,\u201d said a representative of ISM\u2019s alumni office operating their official email address, alumni@ismanila.org.\n\nMarcos also falsely claimed in the same CV that she graduated cum laude from the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Law. This was already debunked by UP Executive Vice President Teodoro Herbosa.\n\nThe same CV indicated that she has an MA in Management and Business Administration from the Asian Institute of Management (AIM), a degree that was never offered at AIM, according to the school\u2019s registrar. \u2013 Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
