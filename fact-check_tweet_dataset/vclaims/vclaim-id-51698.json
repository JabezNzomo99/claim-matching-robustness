Through this article let\u2019s debunk the image.\n\nClaim: Image of PM Modi bowing to a statue of Nehru. Fact: Image of Modi bowing to Gandhi\u2019s statue during the inauguration Rashtriya Swachhata Kendra is digitally morphed so as to look like Modi bowing to the statue of Nehru. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nReverse image search of the image directed us to a tweet by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 08 August 2020. He shared a few pictures which were clicked during the inauguration of Rashtriya Swachhata Kendra. One of the images in which Modi is seen paying tribute to Gandhi by bowing with folded hands is has close resemblance with that shared in the post.\n\nWhen we compare both these images, except for Gandhi and Nehru\u2019s portraits rest is same in both these images. With this, we can clearly say that the image of Modi bowing to Gandhi is digitally morphed so as to look like Modi is bowing to Nehru\u2019s statue.\n\nWhen the portion of the image with Nehru statue is cropped and reverse searched on Google, we found the same image of Nehru\u2019s statue in stock images websites Getty and Shutterstock. The description below the image mention that this statue of late Jawaharlal Nehru is located in Barshi, Solapur, Maharashtra.\n\nTo sum it up, the image of Modi bowing to Gandhi is morphed so as to look like Modi bowing to Nehru.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
