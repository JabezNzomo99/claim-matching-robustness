Lindsey Graham said President Donald Trump \u201cprobably knows more about medicine and specifically viruses\u201d than the \u201cso-called scientists at the NIH and CDC.\u201d\n\nThere is no record of Graham ever making the comment. It originated in a tweet from a user that has shared fake quotes in the past.\n\nThe tweet that appears to have started the claim has been deleted, but screen grabs of it continue to circulate on other social media platforms. (RELATED: Did Trump Call The Coronavirus A \u2018Hoax\u2019 At His South Carolina Rally)\n\n\u201cCAPITOL HILL: @LindseyGrahamSC says @realDonaldTrump \u2018probably knows more about medicine and specifically viruses than any of the so-called scientists at the NIH and CDC. If anyone is going to eradicate this plague it\u2019ll be the president,'\u201d the screen grabbed tweet quotes Graham as saying.\n\nThe comment would have been picked up by the media if Graham had actually said the words, yet no news outlets have reported on it. The quote does not appear on any of his social media pages either.\n\nGraham did release a statement Feb. 26 praising the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. However, at no point did he suggest the president knows more than experts at the National Institutes of Health or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s decision to put Vice President Pence in charge of our nation\u2019s efforts to contain the coronavirus is an excellent idea,\u201d reads the statement. \u201cAnd I have all the confidence in the world that the Vice President and his team will do everything in their power to contain this deadly virus.\u201d\n\nDan Lyons, who describes himself as the \u201cinventor of fake news\u201d in his Twitter bio, tweeted the fabricated quote the same day Graham released that statement. He has shared fake quotes in the past, according to Snopes.\n\nMultiple Twitter users, including Princeton University history professor Kevin Kruse, called out Lyons for the fake quote attributed to Graham.", "lang": "en"}
