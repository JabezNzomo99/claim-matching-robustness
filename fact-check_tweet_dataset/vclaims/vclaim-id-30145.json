Padukone\u2019s visit to the campus irked a section of individuals who, since last night, made #BoycottChhapaak one of the top trends on Twitter. \u2018Chhapaak\u2019 is Padukone\u2019s upcoming film inspired by the life of acid attack survivor Laxmi Aggarwal who was attacked by 32-year-old Naeem Khan in 2005.\n\nIn the latest round of backlash, a section of the media has claimed that the movie portrays Khan as \u2018Rajesh\u2019.\n\nBased on an IMDB link which identifies the screen name of one cast members as \u2018Rajesh\u2019, Swarajyapublished an article claiming, \u201cthe accused is said to have been named \u2018Rajesh\u2019 in Deepika\u2019s movie.\u201d\n\nUpdate: News18 published an article on January 8 titled, \u201cDeepika Padukone\u2019s Chhapaak Trends on Twitter Over \u2018Change\u2019 in Acid Attacker\u2019s Name.\u201d\n\nIndia TV and The Quintrepublished an IANS feed and Jansattapublished an independent report alleging the same.\n\nIndia TV anchor Sushant Sinha repeated the claim during a broadcast on Deepika Padukone\u2019s visit to JNU.\n\nOn January 9, News18 added a new \u2018twist\u2019 to the story based on a tweet by advocate Ishkaran Singh Bhandari. The media outlet claimed that the makers of the film \u2018rectified their error\u2019 and changed the name of the villain after social media criticism.\n\nBJP Haryana IT cell head Arun Yadav tweeted a photograph of Aggarwal and wrote, \u201cThis is Laxmi Aggarwal. Chhapaak is based on her. In 2005, a man named Nadeem Khan threw acid on her in Delhi\u2019s Khan Market. To keep the fabric of secularism intact, our Bollywood has named Nadeem \u2018Rajesh\u2019 in the film. #NameItLikeBollywood\u201c\n\nNational media in-charge of J&K BJP youth wing BJYM Rohit Chahal alleged the same. \u201c\u091c\u093f\u0938 \u0932\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d\u092e\u0940 \u0905\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0935\u093e\u0932 \u092a\u0930 \u0926\u0940\u092a\u093f\u0915\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u092b\u093f\u0932\u094d\u092e \u092c\u0928\u0940 \u0939\u0948, \u0905\u0938\u0932 \u091c\u0940\u0902\u0926\u0917\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0909\u0938\u092a\u0930 \u090f\u0938\u093f\u0921 \u092b\u0947\u0902\u0915\u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u0947 \u0915\u093e \u0928\u093e\u092e \u0928\u0926\u0940\u092e \u0916\u093e\u0928 \u0925\u093e\u0964 \u0932\u0947\u0915\u093f\u0928 \u0926\u0940\u092a\u093f\u0915\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u092b\u093c\u093f\u0932\u094d\u092e \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u090f\u0938\u093f\u0921 \u092b\u0947\u0902\u0915\u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u0947 \u0915\u093e \u0928\u093e\u092e \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0947\u0936 \u0930\u0916 \u0926\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0917\u092f\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0964 \u0930\u0936\u0940\u0926, \u0930\u0908\u0938 \u092f\u093e \u0930\u0939\u092e\u093e\u0928 \u091c\u0948\u0938\u093e \u0915\u0941\u091b \u0915\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902?? #ShameOnBollywood,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nAdvocate Ishkaran Singh Bhandari tweeted, \u201cIf a different name is used & especially a name typically used by different religions will send a Legal Notice.\u201d\n\nReferring to Bhadari\u2019s tweet, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy wrote, \u201c\u2026if they have changed name of accused from Muslim in real life to a Hindu name. That is defamation.\u201d\n\nAlt News contacted Newslaundry co-founder Abhinandan Sekhri who had attended the screening of \u2018Chhapaak\u2019 in Delhi. \u201cI watched the special screening of the movie which was organised for acid attack survivors, and the claim on social media that the accused is portrayed as belonging to the Hindu community is false. The person who is convicted is presented as belonging to the Muslim community, and so are his relatives, with one of them shown in a Burkha,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to PTI journalist Radhika Sharma\u2019s report, \u201cIn the Meghna Gulzar directed film, there is no mention of any Nadeem or Naeem Khan. Moreover, Rajesh is the name of Malti\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe screening was organised by NCW. The person convicted for the acid attack is known as Bashir Khan urf Babboo in the film, whereas Rajesh is the name of the boyfriend of the acid attack survivor, Malti,\u201d Sharma informed Alt News. The journalist covered the movie\u2019s screening for PTI.\n\nA Times Now broadcast also debunked the false claim.\n\nThe usual suspects Prashant Patel Umrao, Shefali Vaidya, author Ravi Rai, Anuj Bajpai and @Nationalist_Om suggested that the Muslim identity of Laxmi Aggarwal\u2019s perpetrator has been whitewashed in \u2018Chhapaak\u2019.\n\nSonam Mahajan whose tweet drew over 7,000 retweets at the time of writing this article wrote, \u201cIf crime has no religion, then why does Bollywood feel the need to change the religion of perpetrators even in biopics?\u201d Mahajan was one of the earliest to float the false claim.\n\nRohit Jaiswal who identifies himself as a \u2018film critic\u2019 questioned, \u201cIf Acid attacker name was Naeem Khan then the same name should have been used in film as well\u2026 Ye Rajesh kya hai??\u201d\n\nOne Monica (@TrulyMonica), who terms herself an \u2018ex-journalist\u2019 on Twitter, also circulated the false claim.\n\nVikas Pandey (@MODIfiedvikas) tweeted \u201cI knew this\u201d and claimed that the attacker\u2019s name was changed to \u2018Rajesh\u2019. He later took down the tweet.\n\nIt is noteworthy Swarjaya later updated its report with the correct information, although clarification on its tweet \u2013 \u201cThe main accused in Lakshmi\u2019s acid case was Naeem Khan but he is said to have been named \u201cRajesh\u201d in Deepika\u2019s movie\u201d \u2013 is yet to be provided.\n\nFurthermore, Free Press Journalcarried a misleading report titled, \u201c#NameItLikeBollywood trends after Deepika\u2019s \u2018Chhapaak\u2019 \u2018changes\u2019 acid attacker\u2019s name from Nadeem Khan to Rajesh\u201d. The article clarifies the misinformation only in the concluding paragraph.\n\n\u2018Chhapaak\u2019 is set to release on January 10, 2020, and the claim that movie whitewashes the Muslim identity of the attacker who threw acid on Laxmi Aggarwal, by portraying him as a Hindu, was found to be false.\n\n[Update: Swarajya deleted its tweet after this report was published. Vikas Pandey\u2019s tweet and erroneous reposts published by News18, Inda TV and Jansatta have been added to the fact-check.]", "lang": "en"}
