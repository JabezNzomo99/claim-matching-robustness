The claim is false; the misleading posts contain a stock photo of a leg in a cast and an unrelated, clickbait video; Jinkee has since posted pictures of herself with both feet; a spokesperson denied any amputation had been carried out.\n\n\n\nThe Facebook thumbnail posted here on July 11 includes a caption and two photos -- one of Jinkee Pacquiao and one of a close-up of a leg in a cast.\n\nA screenshot of the post is shown below.\n\nThe Filipino-language caption translates to English as: \u201cWhat happened to madam Jinky Pacquiao is saddening. one of her feet had to be amputated\u2026 her Fellowship in LA has just ended and then this will suddenly happen\u201d.\n\n\u201cJinky Pacquiao\u201d refers to Jinkee Pacquiao, wife of boxing champion and senator Emmanuel \u201cManny\u201d Pacquiao.\n\nThe \u201c24 Oras\u201d symbol on the left translates as \u201c24 Hours\u201d -- a nightly show from the Philippines broadcast organisation, GMA News. Here is its official Facebook account.\n\nThe white text in the red box translates as: \u201cSenator Manny Pacquiao\u2019s wife, Jinky, had her foot cut off after a car accident.\u201d\n\nBelow that, the truncated phrase reads: \u201cThis is a big test for the family of the Nation\u2019s Fist after the unexpected amputation\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cNation\u2019s fist\u201d is a moniker given to Manny Pacquiao. \n\n\n\nThe post dates from July 11, yet Jinkee Pacquiao has since put up photos of herself on Instagram -- like this one embedded below from July 17 -- showing her with both feet.\n\nSen. Pacquiao\u2019s media relations manager Aquiles Zonio told AFP by email that Jinkee Pacquiao did not have her foot amputated because of a car accident.\n\nA reverse search on the photos shown in the Facebook thumbnail using Google image traced the one taken of the woman standing up to this Instagram post of Jinkee Pacquiao dated January 20, 2019.\n\nA further search using Bing traced the photo of the injured leg to this image on Flickr. The photo, shown in a screenshot below, was taken on May 30, 2006, according to the image hosting service.\n\nThe Facebook thumbnail links to an online report on a separate domain, which contains a TV news clip.\n\nThe online report, shown in a screenshot below, has a Filipino-language caption with the same claim as in the Facebook post. It translates as: \u201cJinky Pacquiao's foot was amputated after the car she was riding in got into an accident\u201d.\n\nWhen clicked, the video plays for several seconds and then stops. Then a prompt to share the video appears, as shown below:\n\nAFP extracted the video url, which leads to this news report by 24 Hours dated December 9, 2012.\n\nThe report is about Manny Pacquiao\u2019s Las Vegas fight against Mexican boxer Juan Manuel Marquez and his hospitalisation after the bout. Here is AFP\u2019s report on the fight.\n\nA screenshot of the video is below:", "lang": "en"}
