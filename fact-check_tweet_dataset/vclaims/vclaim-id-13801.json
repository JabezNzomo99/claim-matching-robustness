Decades in prisons? Death penalty in one of the states of the world\u2019s beacon of democracy?\u201d\n\nIn her next Telegram post, Simonyan asserted: \u201cKindly Ecuador, which today surrendered Assange to the police, demanded that the British not extradite him to the country where he faces death penalty \u2013 i.e. the States. A few years ago Assange told me the UK will extradite him to Sweden and [from] Sweden to the U.S. Precisely where he is under the threat of the death penalty.\u201d\n\nSymonyan\u2019s statement that Assange is facing the death penalty in the U.S. is false.\n\nAccording to the indictment against Julian Assange, unsealed today (April 11) by the U.S. Justice Department, the United States is charging him with \u201cconspiracy to commit computer intrusion.\u201d\n\nAccording to Cornell Law School\u2019s Legal Information Institute, for charges similar to those brought against Assange in the U.S., a \u201cperson shall be fined or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, if Assange, who was arrested today (April 11) in the British capital after being convicted of skipping bail is extradited to the United States, he will have a right to defend himself in a U.S. court, where any defendant is considered innocent until proven guilty.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department said that Assange \u201cwas arrested pursuant to the U.S./UK Extradition Treaty,\u201d and accused him of involvement in one of the largest compromises of classified information in U.S. history.\n\nEarlier this week the Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov made a similar statement claiming that \u201celectric chair\u201d was awaiting Edward Snowden in the United States. Polygraph.info examined his claim and found it false.", "lang": "en"}
