The incident took place at the Arndale Centre at around 11:15 a.m. local time, where a man who was carrying a \u201clarge knife\u201d began \u201clunging and attacking people,\u201d Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson of Greater Manchester Police said. Jackson said while the injuries are \u201cnasty,\u201d none of them are life-threatening. He said police did not know the motivation behind the attack, adding that \u201cit appears random, and it is brutal.\u201d Following the attack, a man originally was arrested on suspicion, preparation and instigation of an act of terrorism. He is believed to have acted alone. A statement tweeted later by Greater Manchester Police said: \u201cThe 40-year-old man, who was arrested on suspicion of committing a terrorism offence, has now been assessed by specialist doctors and compulsorily detained under the Mental Health Act. The investigation will continue in order to fully understand the motives behind the attack.\u201d\n\nWhatever the explanation for the difference in shading of the exposed areas circled in red above \u2013 lighting, camera angles or skin tone variation \u2013 it had nothing to do with CNN\u2019s supposedly altering anything.", "lang": "en"}
