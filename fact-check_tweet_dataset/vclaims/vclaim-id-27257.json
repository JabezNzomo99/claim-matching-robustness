The N.C. House of Representatives approved the bill this spring but it hasn\u2019t been considered by the state Senate.\n\nThe bill drew renewed scrutiny after an Ohio man named James Fields, 20, allegedly rammed his car into a crowd of people protesting a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. The car killed one woman and injured 19 others. The news sparked fears that drivers in North Carolina could hit protesters without legal repercussions.\n\nOn Tuesday, Gov. Roy Cooper called for legislators to let the bill die.\n\n\"The North Carolina legislature should defeat a bill that grants immunity from liability to motorists who strike protesters. That bill passed the state House and remains alive in the Senate. The Senate should kill it. Full stop. Those who attack protesters, weaponizing their vehicles like terrorists, should find no safe haven in our state.\" he wrote.\n\nWe wondered whether the bill really \"grants immunity from liability to motorists who strike protesters,\" as Cooper said.\n\nCooper spokesman Ford Porter elaborated on the governor\u2019s statement in an email.\n\n\"The purpose of the bill is to immunize certain drivers from findings of liability. Courts already take into consideration the circumstances surrounding an accident \u2013 this legislation adds vague new protections specifically for people who hit protesters with their cars,\" Porter said. \"That sends the wrong message and opens the door to potentially serious consequences. Governor Cooper has been clear that our state has no business going down this path.\"\n\nThe bill\u2019s authors, Republican state Reps. Justin Burr and Chris Millis, released a statement saying the bill is \"tightly tailored\" to protect drivers as well as people who are lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.\n\n\"It is intellectually dishonest and a gross mischaracterization to portray North Carolina House Bill 330 as a protection measure for the act of violence that occurred in Charlottesville this past weekend,\" Burr and Millis said. \"Any individual who committed a deliberate or willful act, such as what happened this weekend in Charlottesville, would face appropriately severe criminal and civil liabilities.\"\n\nWhat the bill says\n\nThe one-page bill, which is short by legislative standards, aims to provide legal immunity from personal-injury lawsuits to motorists who exercise \"due care\" when driving but injure someone who blocks traffic while participating in a protest.\n\nThe bill expresses important distinctions: it wouldn\u2019t apply to drivers who injure protesters through \"willful or wanton\" actions; nor would it apply to drivers who injure someone who has a permit to protest in the street. It also wouldn\u2019t apply to someone being criminally prosecuted. And it certainly wouldn\u2019t allow drivers to \"weaponize\" their cars without legal consequence.\n\nIn short, the bill doesn't grant immunity to anyone who hits a protester on purpose.\n\nWhat it changes\n\nAttorneys and legal experts doubt that the bill would have much impact because state laws already offer broad protections to drivers who accidentally hit people who are unlawfully in the street.\n\nIn North Carolina, Virginia, Alabama and Maryland, state law makes it difficult for a plaintiff to win.\n\nOther states apply the doctrine of \"comparative fault.\" Let\u2019s say a protester in a comparative fault state is found to be 20 percent responsible for his or her injury and a driver is found to be 80 percent at fault. State laws in those states merely limit \u2013 not block \u2013 the amount of money awarded to the protester.\n\nIn North Carolina, by contrast, state laws apply the doctrine of \"contributory negligence.\" If a defendant proves \"that the Plaintiff is even 1 percent responsible for their injuries \u2013 they lose automatically,\" said T. Greg Doucette, a criminal defense and business litigation attorney based in Durham.\n\nDoucette said the effect of the bill is unknown because it\u2019s untested. But, on the bill\u2019s surface, it seems to change little about civil litigation.\n\nIf the bill were to pass, how would it play out in court? If a protester is in the street and doesn\u2019t have a permit, but thinks a driver intentionally struck him with his car, the protester would have to prove \"willful and wanton\" intent.\n\nDonald Beskind, a Duke University professor who\u2019s practiced law for more than 30 years, said juries in that kind of situation are asked to consider direct and circumstantial evidence. Most cases are clear cut, he said.\n\n\"If you want to know if someone was careful, you would want to look at what they were doing at the time of the accident. If they were texting, we would infer they were not careful,\" Beskind said.\n\nIf someone drove into protesters and \"on the back side of their car there was a sign that said \u2018Kill the Antifa,\u2019 we would assume they were being willful,\" he added, referring to the anti-fascist political organization.\n\nEffectiveness or ineffectiveness aside, attorneys said the bill might inspire violent acts by people who don\u2019t understand the laws.\n\n\"While I don\u2019t think it would make the Charlottesville thing legal by any stretch of the imagination, it could embolden someone to do something like the Charlottesville guy did,\" said David Stradley, a personal injury lawyer in Raleigh. \"We just don\u2019t need to be encouraging people to do something around a demonstration.\"\n\nCooper overstates what this bill would do. And legal experts say that, while untested, the bill doesn't appear to change litigation and might not offer any additional protections at all. We rate this claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
