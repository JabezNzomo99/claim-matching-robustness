Kamala Harris as his running mate. Harris made history as the first woman of color on a major-party presidential ticket, and would break further ground if elected on Nov. 3, 2020, becoming the first woman to assume the office of U.S. vice president.\n\nIn response, critics of President Donald Trump again turned their attentions to his history of making demeaning and disrespectful statements toward and about women. In particular, internet users widely shared the following quotation, attributed to Trump: \u201cYou have to treat \u2019em like shit.\u201d\n\nOn August 12, the author Stephen King tweeted: \u201cTrump on women, in 1992: \u2018You have to treat \u2019em like shit.'\u201d\n\nOn Facebook, others shared a meme that featured a photograph of Trump, along with the following text: \u201c\u2018Women, you have to treat \u2019em like shit.\u201d \u2014 Donald Trump to New York magazine, 1992\u2033:\n\nThe quotation did not first emerge in 2020. It is among several pronouncements and utterances made by Trump that have been cited by his critics as examples of his attitude toward women. In 2017, an artist with the moniker Saint Hoax used the quotation as part of a series entitled \u201cMaking America Misogynistic Again,\u201d which took misogynistic magazine advertisements from past decades and added Trump quotations to them.\n\nIn 2016, Our Principles, an anti-Trump political action committee founded by Katie Packer, deputy campaign manager for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney\u2019s unsuccessful 2012 campaign, used the line in a television advertisement that featured women reciting various quotations attributed to Trump:\n\nIn 2017, the artist Aria Watson used the line as part of her series \u201cSigned by Trump,\u201d which involved painting various demeaning and offensive quotations, attributed to the president, onto a model.\n\nThe quotation is authentic and originally appeared in a Nov. 9, 1992, feature article about Trump, written by Julie Baumgold and published in New York magazine. The article can be read in full here (beginning on page 36).\n\nThe line actually appears twice in the the piece, first as the author\u2019s synopsis of Trump\u2019s attitude toward women and later as a direct quotation:\n\n\u2026He says outrageous things: \u201c[The social people] all kiss your ass if you\u2019re hot, and they\u2019re kissing hard now. If not, they think you\u2019re a piece of garbage.\u201d He likes to say things like this even when the mikes may be on. He boasts about having poured a whole bottle of wine down Marie Brenner\u2019s back after she wrote a story on him that he hated. His contempt for beautiful women who like to be abused is boundless, and he is full of stories of supermodels, women he might call twelves (not their size), clinging to a rock star\u2019s legs and the rock star kicking them away. You have to treat them like s\u2014.\n\nLater in the article, Baumgold describes a car journey to Trump\u2019s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in the company of Trump and the renowned architect Philip Johnson, whom Trump had asked to redesign part of the casino (emphasis added):\n\nBaumgold\u2019s article then recounts Trump\u2019s discussion of the recent conviction of boxer Mike Tyson, who was found guilty of raping 18-year-old Desiree Washington and given a 10-year prison sentence, with four years suspended, in March 1992:\n\nWe could not find any record of Trump having denied that he said of women, \u201cyou have to treat them like shit.\u201d Snopes asked both the White House and Trump\u2019s reelection campaign if he now denied having made those remarks, but we did not receive a response from either in time for publication.\n\nInterestingly, a letter to the editor appeared in New York magazine a few weeks after Baumgold\u2019s article, purportedly written by Trump\u2019s secretary and offering a firm defense of him. In the Dec. 7, 1992, issue (on page 11), a \u201cCarolin Gallego\u201d wrote:\n\nBased on the fact that I work for Donald Trump as his secretary \u2014 and therefore know him well \u2014 I think he treats women with great respect, contrary to what Julie Baumgold implied in her article \u201cFighting Back\u201d [November 9.] No man that I have seen has given women a greater opportunity in business. The real-estate, construction, and gaming industries are awash with successful women who got their big break from Donald Trump. Likewise, women adore him. I do not believe any man in America gets more calls from women wanting to see him, meet him, or go out with him. The most beautiful women, the most successful women \u2014 all women love Donald Trump. \n\n \n\n Carolin Gallego\n\n Manhattan\n\nIn 2017, when New York reprinted the Gallego letter in the magazine\u2019s 50th anniversary issue, several internet users speculated that it may have been bogus or written by Trump himself. Several journalists have over the years attested that Trump had a habit of boosting his own reputation in conversations with reporters, while posing as publicists named \u201cJohn Miller\u201d or \u201cJohn Baron.\u201d In a sworn deposition in 1990, Trump himself admitted to having used the name \u201cJohn Baron\u201d in the past.\n\nIn one recorded conversation from 1991, \u201cJohn Miller\u201d told a reporter for People magazine that Trump \u201cgets called by everybody, he gets called by everybody in the book, in terms of women\u201d \u2014 a remarkably similar formula of words to the one used by \u201cCarolin Gallego\u201d in the December 1992 letter to New York magazine.\n\nThe use of repetition, superlatives, and hyperbole seen in the Gallego letter (\u201cThe most beautiful women, the most successful women \u2014 all women love Donald Trump\u201d) are also characteristic of Trump\u2019s own patterns of speech and writing. Washingtonian magazine reported in 2017 that they had been unable to locate or identify any woman named Carolin Gallego who worked as Trump\u2019s secretary, noting that the future president\u2019s long-time secretary was Norma Foerderer, who was replaced in that role by Rhona Graff in 2005. Trump\u2019s former personal attorney Michael Cohen told the magazine he did not recognize the name Carolin Gallego.\n\nWe asked the White House and Trump\u2019s reelection campaign if he denied having written the Gallego letter or having asked someone else to write it on his behalf, but we did not receive a response from either in time for publication.", "lang": "en"}
