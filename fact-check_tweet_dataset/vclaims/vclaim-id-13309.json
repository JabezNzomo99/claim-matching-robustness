The Special Counsel's investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\u201d\n\nIn response, the Russian Foreign Ministry said via its Twitter account that accusations of Russian interference, which the Russian government has always categorically denied, were \u201cnothing more than a defamation attempt.\u201d\n\nHowever, while the summary by the attorney general indicates the Mueller report appeared to exonerate the president and his 2016 campaign of collusion, it does not challenge or deny the allegations of Russian interference in the election. On the contrary: the second section of the letter, titled \u201cRussian Interference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election,\u201d goes into detail on this topic.\n\nIt states that the Internet Research Agency, the St. Petersburg-based \u201ctroll farm,\u201d conducted \u201cdisinformation and social media operations in the United States designed to sow social discord and eventually with the aim of interfering with the election.\u201d It also cites the hacking of the DNC\u2019s emails and their dissemination via WikiLeaks. In both cases, Barr notes that Mueller indicted several Russian nationals in connection with these alleged crimes.\n\n\n\nThe narrative by the Russian Foreign Ministry and other Russian officials\u2019 on the Mueller report is being picked up in Western media reporting. For example, an Associated Press report datelined Moscow begins with: \u201cRussia savored an \u2018I told you so\u2019 moment,\u201d quoting President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov who said:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a black cat in a dark room, especially if it isn\u2019t there,\u201d said Peskov. The AP went on to cite the indictment of 25 Russians in sowing discord on social media and hacking Democratic Party e-mails.\n\nHowever, the lion\u2019s share of the AP news story quotes Russians calling the Mueller report \u201ca clear fake,\u201d \u201ca disgrace for the U.S. and its political elites,\u201d and the U.S. media reporting \u201cso many fake scoops\u201d \u2013 part of a narrative apparently being repeated by a number or Russian officials and media outlets.", "lang": "en"}
