The purported prescription includes consuming warm water with lemon, ginger and jaggery mixed with ghee, hot milk with turmeric and inhaling steam once a day.\n\nNanavati Hospital has made public the prescription that they used for treatment of Amitabh Bachchan from COVID-19. \ufeffThe Logical Indian reached out to Navavati Hospital regarding the viral message. \"Vitamin C rich foods and others help to boost immunity against any infections and illnesses. However, these are not recommended by the doctors of Nanavati Hospital for the treatment of COVID-19 infection. Do consult with a doctor before following any such treatment protocol,\" the Spokesperson of Nanavati Super Speciality Hospital, said. The doctors mentioned in the viral WhatsApp forward are indeed from the Nanavati Hospital. Dr Ansari is the Director of Critical Care Services and Dr Limaye is Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine. Can The Remedies Have Any Effect Against Coronavirus?\n\n\n\nTaking extra vitamin C does not even ward off the common cold, though it may shorten the duration of a cold if you catch one. Having said that, vitamin C does serve essential roles in the human body and supports normal immune function. As an antioxidant, the vitamin neutralizes charged particles called free radicals that can damage tissues in the body. It also helps the body synthesize hormones, build collagen and seal off vulnerable connective tissue against pathogens. So yes, vitamin C should absolutely be included in the daily diet to maintain a healthy immune system. But megadosing on supplements is unlikely to lower the risk of catching COVID-19. There is no evidence that suggests that other so-called immune-boosting supplements \u2014 such as zinc, green tea or echinacea \u2014 help to prevent COVID-19, either. The Logical Indian has debunked several of these remedies. It can be read here, here, and here. According to the WHO, while some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. The organization does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials of both western and traditional medicines. WHO maintains that the most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to: (1) Clean your hands frequently and thoroughly (3) Cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue. If a tissue is used, discard it immediately and wash your hands. (4) Maintain a distance of at least 1 metre from others.
