Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Video shows the cruelty of police in Kashmir. Fact: The video is not related to Kashmir or Indian Police. The incident took place in Lahore and the people in the uniform are Pakistan Police. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nIn the comment section of the post, it can be found that a person commented that the incident took place in Lahore and also, at 24 seconds in the video, it can be seen that the description reads, \u2018Zulfiqar Butt from Manga Mundi being arrested\u2019. While no relevant news related to the incident was found from the available information, the location \u2018Manga Mandi\u2019 was found to be located in Lahore.\n\nThe uniform and protective gear of the police in the video also matches with the uniform and protective gear of the police in Lahore.\n\nAt 26 seconds in the video, a logo (\u2018Hawk\u2019) can be seen in the background. So, when searched for that logo, it was found that the logo belongs to \u2018Hawk \u2013 School, College Uniforms and Bags\u2019, which has shops in Lahore. Hence, it can be concluded that the incident took place in Lahore.\n\nTo sum it up, the incident in the video took place in Lahore, not in Kashmir.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Indian Rivers?", "lang": "en"}
