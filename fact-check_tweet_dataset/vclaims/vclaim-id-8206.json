We investigate.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-8206", "url": "https://fullfact.org/economy/are-more-people-self-employed/", "vclaim": "Jeremy Corbyn said today, in his speech to the Labour Party Conference, that \"one in seven\" of those in the labour force are self-employed. This morning the shadow Education Secretary, Lucy Powell, reportedly claimed that the number is \"growing\".\n\nOne in seven is right, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Its latest figures show that just over 31 million people are employed, of which 4.5 million work for themselves. That's around 14.5% of all workers, or one in seven (measuring over May-July 2015).\n\nIs the number of self-employed people \"growing\"? Well, yes, that is the broad trend over the past few years, although it's fluctuated a bit. But the population and the number of workers have also increased over the years, so it's not altogether surprising that so has the number of self-employed people.\n\nMore to the point is whether the proportion is growing. Was that one in seven previously one in eight?\n\nThat depends on where you measure from. In the same period a year ago, to take one point of reference, the proportion of self-employed people was slightly higher than it is now, at 14.9%.\n\nOver the longer term, the proportion does seem to be on the rise. When David Cameron was first elected Prime Minister, for instance, the proportion was 13.5%.\n\nThe lowest point back to 1992, when the figures start, was at the end of 2000 when it was 11.7%. That's almost one in nine people.\n\nHere's the chart\u2014decide for yourself what it shows.\n\nThe ONS has also published analysis comparing back to earlier figures, finding in 2014 that the proportion of workers who were self-employed (15% over the year) was higher than at any point over the past 40 years.\n\nWe added in the last sentence to reference the 2014 ONS analysis.", "lang": "en"}
