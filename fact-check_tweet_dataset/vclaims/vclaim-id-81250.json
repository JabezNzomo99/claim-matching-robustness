One-time presidential candidate Rick Santorum asserted that gun crimes were low back then because people had the right to carry guns. But he actually has the story backward.\n\nThe 1881 gunfight in Tombstone, Ariz., was actually sparked by an effort to enforce the town\u2019s Ordinance No. 9: \u201cIt is hereby declared unlawful to carry in the hand or upon the person or otherwise any deadly weapon within the limits of said city of Tombstone, without first obtaining a permit in writing.\u201d\n\n\u201cCarrying of guns within the city limits of a frontier town was generally prohibited. Laws barring people from carrying weapons were commonplace, from Dodge City to Tombstone,\u201d said Adam Winkler, a professor at UCLA\u2019s School of Law and author of Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America. \u201cWhen Dodge City residents first formed their municipal government, one of the very first laws enacted was a ban on concealed carry. The ban was soon after expanded to open carry, too. The Hollywood image of the gunslinger marching through town with two Colts on his hips is just that \u2014 a Hollywood image, created for its dramatic effect.\u201d\n\nThe result was that, by contemporary standards, gun homicides were relatively rare. In cattle towns such as Tombstone or Dodge City, the average number of homicides was only 1.5 or 2 a year, according to path-breaking research by Robert R. Dykstra of SUNY-Albany. The murder rate was much higher in mining towns, such as Bodie, Calif. During its boom years, the town had 29 murders a year, which translated to a murder rate three times higher than Miami in 1980, according to Richard White\u2019s 1993 book, \u201c\u2019It\u2019s Your Misfortune and None of my Own:\u2019 A New History of the American West.\u201d\n\nWhite noted that the violence was restricted to narrow social milieus, such as armed and drunk young men. \u201cThe towns such as the cattle towns that disarmed young men lowered the rates of personal violence considerably,\u201d White wrote. \u201cThose towns such as Bodie and Aurora that did not disarm men tended to bury significantly more of them.\u201d\n\nMore recent research by Randolph Roth of Ohio State University, however, has challenged the notion that the West was not violent. Rather than look at the annual homicide rate, Roth and colleagues examined the risk of being murdered over time while living out West. \u201cAn adult who lived in Dodge City from 1876 to 1885 faced at least a 1 in 61 chance of being murdered \u2014 1.65 percent of the population was murdered in those 10 years,\u201d Roth wrote. \u201cAn adult who lived in San Francisco, 1850-1865, faced at least a 1 in 203 chance of being murdered, and in the eight other counties in California that have been studied to date, at least a 1 in 72 chance.\u201d\n\nWinkler says the two findings are not inconsistent. \u201cGun homicides were far more rare than Americans have been led to believe,\u201d he said. \u201cMost frontier towns had fewer than two homicides a year during the heyday of the Old West. Yet that is not inconsistent with Roth\u2019s research. The homicide rate was high in these towns because the population was very small. Even one murder in a town with only a few dozen residents leads to a high homicide rate. These towns were violent, but not nearly as violent as some imagine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe West was extraordinarily violent in the midnineteenth century, and it continued to be more homicidal than the rest of the United States until the 1930s,\u201d Roth concluded. \u201cThe West may not have been as homicidal as movies and dime novels would suggest, but compared with the rest of the Western world in the nineteenth century and by the standards criminologists and epidemiologists use today, it was very violent.\u201d\n\nResponding to this column, Santorum spokesman Matt Beynon said: \u201cIn the modern U.S., the national trend is unmistakable: more firearms are in private hands than ever, more people can legally carry firearms in more public places than ever, and violent crime and homicide rates continue to decrease to historic lows. We have repeatedly reported on this trend in our alerts, which cite to FBI crime statistics, NICS checks, and BATFE manufacturing and import figures.\u201d\n\nMany people had weapons in the West, but contrary to Santorum\u2019s claim or Hollywood lore, they generally were not able to carry them within city limits. In towns without such limits, the murder rate (or, as Santorum put it, \u201cgun crimes\u201d) was significantly higher.\n\nWe were tempted to give this claim Four Pinocchios, but Schieffer\u2019s question had its own misleading elements, so we will keep this at Three. Schieffer asked Santorum if \u201cwe are going backwards,\u201d but the irony is that in Old West, persons entering Tombstone would have needed to check their gun at the sheriff\u2019s office when they arrived in town. No such law exists today.", "lang": "en"}
