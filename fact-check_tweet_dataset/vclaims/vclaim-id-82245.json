Bobby Jindal\u2019s (R) most common talking points are his anti-tax mantra and his record on cutting Louisiana taxes. In a recent TV interview, Jindal was asked about the tax and fee increases approved in the most recent budget. Yet the presidential hopeful responded that he actually gave a tax credit, which amounted to a tax cut.\n\nBut Jindal indicated to lawmakers that he would veto the state budget if it did not include the Student Assessment for Valuable Education (SAVE) program, which would set up a new tax credit for higher education. This was intended to \u201coffset\u201d tax increases in the state budget plan, so that Louisiana does not have a net tax increase.\n\nATR, headed by Grover Norquist, responded to lawmakers that the organization does not oppose or support the SAVE program: \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the SAVE Act, why not find other offsetting tax cuts that are more to your liking? ATR is agnostic as to whether a credit or deduction is good policy. \u2026 Removing tax credits or deductions while reducing the tax rate so that the total bill is revenue neutral is not a tax hike.\u201d\n\nBut the program largely is an accounting measure. It sets up a separate state obligation to pay $350 million for higher education, in \u201cfees\u201d assessed on families and students. (This money normally would have come out of the state general fund, according to the Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana.) So families and students would have seen a tuition increase. It also gives $350 million in tax credits for the families. But families and students don\u2019t see either the fee or the tax credit; the tax credit gets transferred directly to the Board of Regents, which oversees higher education. The Board of Regents then uses the credit to get pay off the obligation through the Department of Revenue.\n\nJindal\u2019s campaign put us in touch with the state revenue secretary, who explained that there is a tax revenue neutrality after five years (fiscal years 2016 to 2020). Therefore, the budget meets Jindal\u2019s pledge that there would not be a net tax increase. But the tax revenue breakdown provided by the department shows that the net tax revenue neutrality happens after five years largely is due to this \u201ctax credit.\u201d\n\nBottom line: The SAVE program sets up a new tax credit to \u201coffset\u201d the state\u2019s tax and fee increases. The state \u201cassessed\u201d a \u201cfee\u201d on families. But families will not see any difference as a result. The \u201ccut\u201d that Jindal refers to is to the overall state tax revenue over five years, not to the families\u2019 tax obligation every year.\n\nJindal campaign spokeswoman Shannon Dirmann said in a statement: \u201cThis is nothing more than a sour grapes argument from liberals who wanted the Governor to increase taxes. It\u2019s a cut. Here is why: There were 12 bills proposed this session by legislators to raise tuition on students because Louisiana is one of two states where the Legislature controls tuition and fees. The Governor wanted to provide a tax credit to families to help them pay for those rising costs. The SAVE credit does that by reducing the burden on families and students, who would otherwise be paying more to send their kids to college. We think that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nBut in practice, this is an accounting measure set up to avoid a net tax revenue increase on paper. Jindal says the tax credit is actually a tax cut for families, but that\u2019s not the case. Jindal claims families will see a tax cut thanks to his new budget. But in reality, families won\u2019t notice anything as a result of this program added to the budget, as state officials confirmed.\n\nThis type of numbers magic only exists in the budget accounting world, and means nothing to ordinary taxpayers. We wavered between Three and Four Pinocchios. But the state did, indeed, create this new obligation and did establish this \u201ctax credit,\u201d for all intents and purposes. And it does contribute to an overall net tax revenue decrease after five years. Such accounting tricks are the reason why many people hate politics \u2014 but it does not quite rise to Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
