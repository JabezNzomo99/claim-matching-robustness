This resolution passed largely along party lines, with 231 Democrats and 1 independent voting in favor of the resolution, and 194 Republicans and 2 Democrats voting against.\n\nShortly after this vote, some supporters of 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard expressed disappointment that the congresswoman had voted in favor of the impeachment proceedings:\n\nConservative personality Ann Coulter came to Gabbard\u2019s defense, however, telling Coulter\u2019s 2.2 million Twitter followers that Gabbard, who has courted the Republican vote with appearances on Fox News, didn\u2019t actually vote for the resolution because she is a senator and not a member of the House of Representatives:\n\nGabbard is a member of the House, not the Senate, and she voted with the Democrats to formalize the procedures in the impeachment investigation into Trump.\n\nGabbard, D-Hawaii, describes herself as \u201cSoldier. Veteran. Surfer. Congress. Candidate for President\u201d on her Twitter bio. Her official website can be found at gabbard.house.gov. She is listed in the House of Representatives\u2019 directory of members. In November 2012, when Gabbard was first elected to the House, the Washington Post wrote: \u201cTulsi Gabbard, a Democrat from Hawaii, will become the first Hindu-American congresswoman, after defeating her Republican rival on Tuesday.\u201d\n\nAs Gabbard is a member of the House, she had the opportunity to vote on the Oct. 31, 2019, resolution to formalize procedures for the impeachment investigation. And, like the majority of her Democrat colleagues, she voted in favor of the resolution. Gabbard\u2019s name is listed in the \u201cYeas\u201d column for Resolution 660 on the House of Representatives\u2019 website.", "lang": "en"}
