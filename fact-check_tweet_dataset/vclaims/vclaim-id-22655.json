Biden during a campaign event this month in Hampton, N.H.\n\nSince announcing his candidacy, he has defended his decades-long record on criminal justice and climate change, rejected assertions he is a moderate and gone after President Trump. Here\u2019s how his claims stack up.\n\nIn the three weeks since former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, he has been widely portrayed in polls and commentary as the front-runner. On the stump, Mr. Biden has focused on President Trump\u2019s shortcomings in broad pronouncements about morality and character. At the same time, he has sought to parry criticism from the progressive wing of the Democratic Party about the record he has compiled over his nearly five-decade career in public service. While Mr. Biden\u2019s reputation for gaffes may have not caught up to him yet, his defenses against the left and the charges he has leveled against the right have not always been entirely accurate. \u201cThis idea that the crime bill generated mass incarceration \u2014 it did not generate mass incarceration.\u201d \u201cIf you go back and look, the black caucus supported the bill.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Nashua, N.H., in May Mr. Biden sponsored the Senate version of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. While other Democrats have backed away from the bill, Mr. Biden has defended it with statements that lack a full account of its history and impact.\n\nAs violent crime rose in the 1970s and 1980s, states began to pass harsher sentencing laws. The 1973 Rockefeller laws in New York established lengthy mandatory sentences for drug offenses. Washington State passed the first \u201ctruth in sentencing\u201d law in 1984, requiring prisoners to serve a long portion of their sentences before being eligible for early release. California enacted a broad \u201cthree strikes\u201d law in 1994, which required 25-year sentences for third-time serious offenders. The federal government followed suit, establishing mandatory sentences for drug offenses (with a notorious 100 to 1 disparity between powder and crack cocaine) and enacting the 1994 crime bill. In remarks in Hampton, N.H. this month, Mr. Biden singled out \u201cthree big things\u201d in the bill: funding for crime prevention, gun control measures like the assault weapons ban and the Violence Against Women Act. Those portions \u201care important but not the major thrust,\u201d said Marc Mauer, the executive director of the Sentencing Project, which advocates reducing incarceration. Mr. Biden omitted more contentious components of the legislation: authorizing federal funding for prison construction and more police officers; incentivizing states to establish \u201ctruth in sentencing\u201d guidelines; increasing the number of federal crimes subject to the death penalty; and enacting a federal \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision.\n\nAs the bill moved through the legislative process, members of the Congressional Black Caucus expressed misgivings and produced an alternative measure. Eleven of 38 House members of the caucus voted against a procedural motion to advance the bill, and 12 voted against the final version. As for the 1994 crime bill\u2019s role in mass incarceration, the data shows that it was not the genesis or principal factor. A spokesman for Mr. Biden pointed to an Urban Institute study that examined the effect of the crime bill on \u201ctruth in sentencing\u201d state laws. It found the federal law had a \u201ccomparatively minor\u201d influence on states, with a few exceptions. The spokesman also noted that Mr. Biden had criticized the \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision in 1994. The prison population \u2014 the majority of which is housed in state institutions \u2014 increased from under 200,000 in the early 1970s to over 300,000 by the end of the decade, then more than tripled to about one million in 1994, the year the bill was passed. The rise in the prison population continued, albeit at a slower rate, climbing to more than 1.5 million by 2009. Though it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint the precise effect of the bill, experts said the measure contributed to the trend. \u201cFederal policy still matters. It helps shape public opinion and can often influence what states do,\u201d said Inimai Chettiar, the director of the Brennan Center\u2019s Justice Program, which seeks to reduce the prison population. The bill, she said, \u201cencouraged them to mass incarcerate further.\u201d Lauren-Brooke Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center, said the bill \u201cgalvanized the prison construction boom,\u201d with state and federal correctional facilities increasing 21.4 percent from 1995 to 2005.\n\n\u201cThere was no one cause of mass incarceration,\u201d Ms. Chettiar said. \u201cMany of these laws passed by the federal government and states were joint contributors.\u201d \u201cI said back in 1987, I said we have an existential threat.\u201d \n\n\u2014 Hampton, N.H., in May Mr. Biden was one of the first members of Congress to introduce climate change legislation. In 1986, Mr. Biden introduced the Global Climate Protection Act, which directed the president to create a task force on developing and enforcing a strategy to combat climate change. While there is no record of him using the exact words \u201cexistential threat,\u201d Mr. Biden spoke at length on the Senate floor in January 1987 about the risk of \u201cglobal warming \u2014 a term, though seemingly esoteric, that could, as time passes, come to signify an environmental disaster second only to nuclear war.\u201d \u201cGlobal warming, should it occur in accord with the direst predictions, would be a catastrophe of biblical proportions for the entire world,\u201d Mr. Biden said then. \u201cEven though decades away, the most serious consequences of global warming could prove unavoidable unless we act now to prevent them. Our failure to show foresight when the dangers are clearly discernible would be an unforgivable dereliction of duty to our children and all mankind not yet born.\u201d His bill eventually made its way into foreign relations funding legislation that was signed into law in 1987. \u201cI have the most progressive record of anybody running for the \u2014 anybody who would run\u201d \n\n\u2014 Delaware, in March \u201cI was always labeled one of the most liberal members of the United States Congress.\u201d \n\n\u2014 ABC interview, in April The Biden campaign pointed to scoring from DW-Nominate, an ideological position tracker based on votes and maintained by the University of California at Los Angeles, that shows Mr. Biden as more liberal than 74 percent of members of Congress after being elected to the Senate in 1972. Among members of his own party, though, Mr. Biden was consistently in the ideological center, according to DW-Nominate. In his last term in the Senate, which ended in 2008, Mr. Biden ranked to the right of fellow 2020 candidates Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and to the left of Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. (The other Democratic senators running for president did not take office until after Mr. Biden left the Senate.)", "lang": "en"}
