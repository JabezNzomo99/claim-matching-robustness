On 10 July 2020, UP Police fired at Vikas Dubey when he allegedly attempted to snatch a weapon and flee while being brought to Kanpur from Madhya Pradesh. Dubey was declared dead due to the bullet injuries in the firing. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of UP Police dancing after the encounter of gangster Vikas Dubey on \u201810 July 2020\u2019. Fact: Video is not of any recent incident and is found to exist on the internet at least since \u2018February 2019\u2019. Also, the Policemen seen dancing in the video are Delhi Police. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen we subjected the screenshots of the video to reverse image search technique, the same video was found on YouTube. The video had the title \u2018Police dance // Me Nikla Gaddi lekar // SHO Dance // Police Program\u2019 and was uploaded on \u20184 February 2019\u2019.\n\nIf we closely observe the video, on the uniform of one of the Police officers, the name \u2018D.P.\u2019 can be seen indicating that he belongs to \u2018Delhi Police\u2019.\n\nDuring the search process, another video of the same incident was found. In that video too, on another Police officer\u2019s uniform, the name \u2018D.P.\u2019 can be seen. So, the Policemen dancing in the video are Delhi Police, not Uttar Pradesh Police as said in the post.\n\nTo sum it up, an old video of Delhi Police dancing is being falsely shared as \u2018UP Police dancing after encounter of Vikas Dubey\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
