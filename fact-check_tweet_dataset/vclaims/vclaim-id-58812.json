However, she does mention 80 crore families at the end part of the interview.]\n\nUnion Minister Smriti Irani was extensively trolled after she allegedly made a statement that the Modi government had provided ration to 80 crore citizens in India.\n\n\n\nThe statement was made during an interaction with Aaj Tak journalist Anjana Om Kashyap on the channel's LIVE debate. The claim has been extensively circulated on social media. Netizens asked how can PM Modi provide ration to 80 crore families when there are only 25 crore families in India. Srivatsa Y B, National campaign in-charge of Indian Youth Congress tweeted on the issue. His tweet was shared over 4000 times.\n\nShe used the Hindi word 'nagarik' which translates to citizens in English and not family when the ticker appeared. In the video of her speech at exactly 1:22 timestamp, she can be heard making the statement.\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343.
