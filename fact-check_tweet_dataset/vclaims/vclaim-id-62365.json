It shows a fictional exchange between Hart and Reeves.\n\n\"STOP! You have to wear a mask in here,\" the comedian says in the meme.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Similar posts have been shared tens of thousands of times, according to CrowdTangle, an audience metrics tool.\n\nWe\u2019ve previously fact-checked inaccurate claims about face mask rules and concealed-weapon laws, so we wanted to investigate this Facebook post.\n\nThere is no federal law that bans carrying a concealed weapon while wearing a mask. The Facebook post comes from a blog post about an Illinois statute that prohibits carrying a firearm while wearing a face covering. But the Illinois State Police said that law does not apply to lawful concealed-weapon permit holders who abide by the state's COVID-19 mask requirements.\n\nThe claim stems from an April 25 article on a website called Illinois Leaks.\n\nIllinois Leaks is run by the Edgar County Watchdogs, a nonprofit 501(c)(4) organization that aims to expose government corruption and waste. The article focuses on Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker\u2019s April 30 executive order, which required the public to wear face coverings in public to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The order went into effect May 1.\n\nIllinois Leaks wrote that the order either \"strips a gun owner of his rights while complying with the executive order to wear a mask, or makes them a criminal if they exercise their gun rights while complying with the executive order to wear a mask.\"\n\nIt does neither of those things.\n\nThe source of the Illinois Leaks article is a state statute that says it\u2019s illegal for someone to carry a gun when \"hooded, robed or masked in such manner as to conceal his or her identity.\" Violating that law is punishable by a class four felony, which comes with a maximum prison sentence of three years, or six years for an extended term.\n\nOn its face, the article seems to have a point about the letter of the law and Pritzker\u2019s executive order. But the spirit of those rules paints a different picture.\n\nA statement published in late April by the Illinois State Police says the executive order \"was not intended to negatively impact permit holders under the Illinois Concealed Carry Act while legally carrying firearms.\"\n\n\"The executive order does not require or suggest that law enforcement should arrest or criminally charge conceal carry license permit holders for wearing protective masks while in public as long as they are complying with the other provisions of the Illinois Concealed Carry Act and are not committing any other violations of Illinois law,\" the state police said.\n\nThe Illinois attorney general\u2019s office told us that it would be up to the discretion of local prosecutors whether to bring charges against someone for violating the statute. The state police said in its statement that it expects police officers \"will use appropriate judgment\" and state\u2019s attorneys \"will likewise exercise sound prosecutorial discretion.\"\n\nAccording to some tallies, about 15 states, as well as cities and counties, have anti-mask laws on the books that pre-date the coronavirus pandemic. Some states, especially those in the South, enacted those laws around the turn of the century to combat the Ku Klux Klan, whose members don white hoods.\n\nOne of those laws is in North Carolina. It prohibits people from covering their faces in public, but that law is currently suspended and does not mention firearms at all. We couldn\u2019t find any other state where wearing a protective mask while carrying a concealed weapon is currently banned.\n\nA Facebook post says wearing a face mask while carrying a firearm in public is a class four felony.\n\nThere is no federal law that bans carrying a concealed weapon while wearing a mask. There is a law against being \"hooded, robed or masked\" while carrying a gun in Illinois, but the Illinois State Police said the state\u2019s COVID-19 mask requirements do not require law enforcement to arrest lawful concealed-weapon permit holders.", "lang": "en"}
