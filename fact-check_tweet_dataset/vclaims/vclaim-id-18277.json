The photo is not new; it was posted online in 2014.\n\nThe posts, including this one and this one, appeared on Facebook from December 4, 2018, showing Roxas, a political rival of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, travelling on Manila\u2019s public train service.\n\nThe caption, when translated to English, says: \u201cOh no, Mar has another new viral picture in the MRT\u201d.\n\nMRT refers to the Metro Rail Transit, the train system in Manila. \n\nThe MRT has long struggled with maintenance issues, delays, and overcrowding.\n\nComments on the posts indicated people suspected Roxas was riding the MRT just for publicity because he was running for senator in the 2019 elections.\n\nOne comment, when translated to English, says: \"So all the time he\u2019s lived in the greater Manila area, he only took the MRT now - nothing to do with the upcoming elections, surely!\"\n\nA reverse search found the photo was posted to Facebook in 2014 when Roxas was a cabinet secretary in the previous administration of Benigno Aquino.\n\nThe photo was also published in 2014 by different websites, including here and here.\n\nIt was also posted in a 2014 Reddit thread with the comment: \u201cMar Roxas is pathetic and getting desperate. Apparently taken by a random train rider during the Friday rush hour\u201d.\n\nThe misleading posts have been shared hundreds of times since they were posted. \u2013 Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
