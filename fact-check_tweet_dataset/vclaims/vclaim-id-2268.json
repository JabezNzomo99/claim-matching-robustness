Those claims were made-up by a satirical website.\n\nDid Katie Couric cancel an interview with Hillary Clinton as reported by Fresh Daily News on Aug. 24, 2017? Article states Clinton interview was to air on Couric\u2019s Sunday Program.\n\nFacebook users have flagged a fake news story that was published on several different websites under the headline: \u201cKatie Couric Speaks Out On Canceling Clinton Interview: \u2018It Was Over When She Called Him The N Word.'\u201d A number of FactCheck.org readers have asked about it as well.\n\nThe story falsely claims that Clinton called former President Barack Obama a racial slur.\n\n\u201cKatie Couric has come out publicly and corroborated the story of a fired sound tech who clearly heard Hillary Clinton use the \u2018N\u2019 word and refused to remain quiet,\u201d the story says.\n\n\u201cCouric was so offended she refused to continue [the interview].\u201d\n\nNone of that happened. Couric was never scheduled to interview Clinton in the first place.\n\nThe story originated on ourlandofthefree.com, a prolific satirical website. A disclaimer on its \u201cabout us\u201d page says: \u201cOurlandofthefree.com makes no guarantee that anything you find here will be based at all in reality.

It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me.\u201d\n\nReaders may notice that the bogus story doesn\u2019t say when the alleged interview was supposed to take place. It also claims that Couric works for CBS, which hasn\u2019t been true since 2011.\n\nCouric is currently planning to work on a \u201cproject basis\u201d with Oath \u2014 a division of Verizon that combined Yahoo and AOL. Most recently, Couric was the global news anchor for Yahoo News until her contract expired at the end of June.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n\u201cKatie Couric Speaks Out On Canceling Clinton Interview: \u2018It Was Over When She Called Him The N Word.\u2019\u201d Americanspoliticnews.info.
