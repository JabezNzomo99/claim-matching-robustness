In one ongoing suit, Kentucky protesters who attempted to disrupt a rally in March 2016 are suing the president in federal court for incitement to riot after he urged \u201cGet \u2019em out of here\u201d from the stage, upon which members of the crowd attacked and forcibly removed the protesters.\n\nAs part of these criticisms, a cartoon emerged in June 2017 which appeared to accuse White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders of misinforming the public about Trump\u2019s record on encouraging or condoning violence.\n\nAlong with presenting eight purported statements by the president, the cartoon quotes Sanders as saying that \u201cThe President in no way, form, or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence\u201d:\n\nThe cartoon has been shared numerous times since June and resurfaced in February 2018, when it was posted by the Impeach Trump Facebook page and tweeted out by singer/actress Bette Midler.\n\nThe cartoon was rarely credited to its creator, the illustrator Jesse Duquette, who publishes The Daily Don, a series of cartoons about the presidency of Donald Trump. Duquette first posted the cartoon to Facebook on 30 June 2017.\n\nWe\u2019ve received many inquiries from readers about the authenticity of the quotations featured in the cartoon, and they are all statements made by Donald Trump. Although each is presented in isolation, they fairly reflect the context in which Trump uttered them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to punch him in the face\u201d\n\nTrump said this in front of a crowd of supporters, after a protester was removed from one of his rallies in Las Vegas on 23 February 2016.\n\n\u201cMaybe he should have been roughed up\u201d\n\nTrump said this on Fox and Friends on 22 November 2015, in reference to Black Lives Matter protester Mercutio Southall Jr., who was ejected from a Trump rally in Birmingham, Alabama a day earlier. Video footage appears to show Trump supporters jostling, kicking and punching Southall, prompting questions from the Fox and Friends about the \u2018roughing up\u2019 of the protester.\n\nIn response (at the 27-second mark), Trump defended the treatment of Southall, calling him \u201cobnoxious\u201d and his protest \u201cabsolutely disgusting.\u201d\n\n\u201cPart of the problem is no one wants to hurt each other anymore\u201d\n\nTrump said something very close to this at a tense rally in St. Louis, Missouri in March 2016. Protesters repeatedly disrupted the then-candidate\u2019s stump speech, prompting Trump to call for their removal on several occasions, in no uncertain terms, urging \u201cGet \u2019em out of here.\u201d\n\nAppearing frustrated at the speed of police and security agents in ejecting a group of demonstrators, Trump bemoaned the care taken by law enforcement to not inflict physical harm on protesters while removing them from the venue.\n\nHear those comments at the 8:05 mark of this video:\n\nTrump said this on 11 August 2015, when asked at a press conference in Birch Run, Michigan whether he would ever yield the stage to a protester at one of his events.\n\nTwo days earlier, Black Lives Matter demonstrators came on stage at a Bernie Sanders rally in Seattle, taking over the podium and interrupting the candidate\u2019s stump speech. Sanders reluctantly gave the microphone to the protesters.\n\nAt the press conference in Michigan, a reporter asked Trump \u201cWould you give up your microphone to a protester?\u201d The candidate responded:\n\n\u201cThe audience hit back. That\u2019s what we need a little bit more of\u201d\n\nTrump said this at a press conference in Palm Beach, Florida on 11 March 2016. He was referring to the Las Vegas incident weeks earlier, after which he mused that he would like to have punched a protester in the face.\n\nTrump again attacked the protester in question, calling him \u201cvicious\u201d and accusing him of instigating the violence against Trump supporters: \u201cHe was a guy who was swinging [punches] \u2014 very loud, and then started swinging at the audience and you know what, the audience swung back, and I thought it was very, very appropriate. He was swinging, he was hitting people, and the audience hit back. And that\u2019s what we need a little bit more of.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you do (hurt him), I\u2019ll defend you in court, don\u2019t worry about it\u201d\n\nTrump said this during another rally in March 2016, this time at Macomb County Community College in Warren, Michigan. The familiar pattern was on display \u2014 a small group of protesters outstays their welcome and are forcibly removed from the venue, and Trump encourages violence among his followers.\n\nAddressing a particular section of the crowd, Trump says \u201cYeah get him out, try not to hurt him. If you do I\u2019ll defend you in court, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n\nAt a rally in Kansas City, Missouri on 12 March 2016, Trump riffed on an incident earlier in the day in Dayton, Ohio, when a protester attempted to storm the stage he was on, before being dragged away by Secret Service agents.\n\nReflecting on the dramatic earlier incident, the candidate said, \u201cHe got over this railing \u2026 tries to make a rush at me \u2014 I was ready, I don\u2019t know if I would\u2019ve done well but I would\u2019ve been out there fighting, folks. I don\u2019t know if I would\u2019ve done well, but I would\u2019ve been \u2018boom boom boom, I\u2019ll beat the [crap out of you].\u201d\n\nOn the words \u201cboom boom boom,\u201d Trump made a punching motion. He mouthed the words \u201ccrap out of you.\u201d\n\nWhile the other incidents referred to in the cartoon are examples of Trump encouraging violence against protesters, it\u2019s worth pointing out that he was talking here about defending himself in a scenario where someone had rushed toward the stage in an aggressive manner.\n\nTrump said this at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa in February 2016, although the quotation is truncated. A week earlier, in Iowa City, a protester threw a tomato at the candidate as he was delivering his stump speech.\n\nWhen Trump came to Cedar Rapids, he referenced the tomato incident while riffing during a rally of his supporters and said, \u201cIf you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously, ok. Just knock the hell \u2014 I promise you I will pay for the legal fees, I promise.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president in no way, form, or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence.\u201d\n\nSarah Huckabee-Sanders said this at the White House Daily Press Briefing on 29 June 2017. That morning, Trump had launched social media attacks against Mika Brzezinski, co-host of MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, in a series of controversial and personal tweets which some observers criticized as being \u201cbeneath the dignity\u201d of the office of president.\n\nIn that context, CBS News Chief White House Correspondent Major Garrett put to Huckabee-Sanders a criticism of the president, namely that his vituperative tweeting \u201ccan create an atmosphere of violence.\u201d Huckabee-Sanders responded, \u201cThe president in no way, form, or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence. If anything, quite the contrary, and he was simply pushing back and defending himself.", "lang": "en"}
