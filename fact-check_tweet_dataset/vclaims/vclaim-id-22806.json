The netizens are trolling the leader with a logic that there was no BJP candidate in the constituency where Pawar voted. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claims in the post.\n\nClaim: Sharad Pawar said that his vote went to BJP when he voted for his party. But Pawar voted in a constituency where there was no candidate from the BJP. Fact: Sharad Pawar said that his vote went to BJP when he voted for his party on the EVMs at presentations in Hyderabad and Gujarat. He was not talking about his vote in the actual elections. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nNot only users on Facebook, but also the official handle of BJP Karnataka has tweeted the same thing about Pawar. In the tweet, they also accused Pawar of telling lies.\n\nThe tweet also has a link to a New18 article with the title: \u201c\u2018Saw My Vote for NCP Get Cast to BJP\u2019: Sharad Pawar Raises Concern Over Use of EVMs\u201d. So, the reasoning in the tweet was made based on the title of the article. But in the full article of News18, it can be found that Pawar said that in the conferences at Hyderabad and Gujarat when he voted on his party\u2019s symbol, the vote went to BJP. So, he was referring to EVMs at conferences, not the EVM at the General Elections-2019. Pawar\u2019s statements can be also found in a tweet on his official Twitter handle\n\nTo sum it up, Sharad Pawar said his vote went to BJP on an EVM at a presentation, not in the General Elections-2019.\n\nDid you watch our Facebook live on Fake News (Misinformation)", "lang": "en"}
