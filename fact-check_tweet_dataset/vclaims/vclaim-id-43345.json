No, that's not true: a fake-news, satirical website put out the hoax.\n\nThe claim originated in an article (archived here) where it was published by World News Daily Report on March 27, 2020, under the title \"Covid -19: Chinese Health Authorities Confirm Patient Zero 'Had Sex With Bats'\" The story opened:\n\nYin Dao Tang, 24, from the province of Hubei, is the first case of the novel coronavirus that emerged on November 17, according to Chinese government data. Tang is believed to have contracted the disease after indulging in sexual acts with several animals, including bats. \"We believe that patient zero has contracted COVID-19 through oral, genital or anal sexual penetration with various animals, especially bats,\" Chinese officials said yesterday.\n\nCould COVID-19 have started via animal-to-human (zoonotic) transmission? It has happened, though usually in markets where live animals are sold for cooking.

Very often, their stories feature an image showing a random mugshot found in a photo gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime-scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalists to rank the reliability of websites, describes worldnewsdailyreport.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard, the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
