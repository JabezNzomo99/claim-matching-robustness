The claim goes onto say that the media isn\u2019t showing him because he is a Muslim. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Photo of Mohammad Zubair, who invented a drone which can detect landmines. Media isn\u2019t showing him because he is a Muslim Fact: The boy in the photo has invented a drone which detects landmines but the boy\u2019s name is not \u2018Mohammad Zubair\u2019. He is Harshwardhan Zala. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image was run through the Google Reverse Image Search, a similar photo was found in an article published by the \u2018Huffington Post\u2019 in 2017. In the article, it can be read that he signed an \u2018agreement worth Rs 5 crore with the Gujarat government for a laser drone which can help detect hidden landmines in war fields.\u201d But, in the article, it is mentioned that his name is Harshwardhan Zala (not \u2018Mohammad Zubair\u2019). On searching with the name \u2018Harshwardhan Zala\u2019, various newspaper articles confirming his name as \u2018Harshwardhan Zala\u2019 can be found in the search results.\n\nAlso, recently, Friday Magazine has published his photo on its cover calling him the \u2018Drone Boy\u2019. \n\n\n\nTo sum it up, the \u2018Drone\u2019 boy in the photo is Harshwardhan Zala, not \u2018Mohammad Zubair\u2019.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
