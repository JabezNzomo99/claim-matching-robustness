The video, originally posted in 2019, is still circulating on Facebook.\n\nThe caption of the Facebook post reads, \u201cSend this video to the whole of India and reach the corner of the world by any means. Save the children Plz. I did it. And you can not imagine how big help you are doing by sharing.\u201d\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The three-year-old incident from Haryana\u2019s Panchkula was not a kidnap-for-ransom case. The kids were abducted by their father who wanted to \u201csave\u201d them from his \u201cabusive\u201d estranged wife.\n\nThe video, posted last year, has been shared more than 62,000 times. Many Facebook users are still sharing it, believing the incident to be a kidnap-for-ransom case.\n\nThe archived versions of these posts can be seen here and here.\n\nUsing InVID and reverse-image search, we found that the incident was reported by several media outlets in 2019.\n\nAs per these news reports, the incident took place on May 16, 2019, in Panchkula, Haryana. One Gurpreet Singh had kidnapped his two children with the help of three associates from his father-in-law Subhash Singh while they were returning from school.\n\nPolice booked an FIR against Gurpreet on the basis of a complaint by his father-in-law. But he was not arrested.\n\nLater, Gurpreet called a press conference in Panchkula, where his kids were also present, and confessed to kidnapping his children to \u201csave\u201d them from his \u201cabusive\u201d wife with whom he was fighting a divorce case in court.\n\nGurpreet alleged that even before the divorce was granted by the court, his wife had remarried without disclosing her marital status and the fact that she had children. He claimed his wife used to torture the kids, and as a father, he wanted to save them.\n\nAs per reports, Manish, the second husband, was also present at the press conference, where he confessed that he was duped and blackmailed by the woman. Manish had also filed a police complaint against her.\n\nSince the matter is in court, Panchkula police refused to comment on the incident and the woman\u2019s family had also chosen not to speak to the media.\n\nFact check website \u201cVishvas News\u201d had reported about the incident last year.\n\nTherefore, it is confirmed that the viral video of child-lifting is an outcome of a family dispute and not a kidnap-for-ransom as wrongly claimed on social media.", "lang": "en"}
