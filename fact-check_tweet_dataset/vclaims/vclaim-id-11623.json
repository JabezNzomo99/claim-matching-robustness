No, that's not true: while the shooting did happen, police say they have not identified the shooter yet and like with every breaking mass shooting situation internet trolls are saying the comedian did it.\n\nTAn example can be found in this tweet published on November 8, 2018 from a Twitter user named \"setrack\" (archived here) which read:\n\nOf course ABC7 reported no such thing.\n\nFor actual information about the shooting, check out live coverage of CNN here:\n\nBlaming right-wing comedian Sam Hyde of being the suspect after a mass shooting is a strange in-joke that has been going on for years.\n\nSam Hyde is not the perpetrator of a mass shooting. But whenever a shooter strikes and the news reports casualties, trolls race to name Hyde as the culprit. In the worst cases, authorities have been tricked into giving Hyde's name to the press.\n\nHere is more information about Sam Hyde and the infamous \"Sam Hyde Is The Shooter\" meme originally propagated by 4chan trolls:", "lang": "en"}
