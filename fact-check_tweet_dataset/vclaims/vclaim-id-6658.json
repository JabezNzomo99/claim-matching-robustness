For example, one study reported that the educational gain from attending a grammar school is around twice as high for pupils eligible for free schools meals, compared to the overall impact across all pupils.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cone study\u201d referred to was first published by academics at the University of Bristol in 2004, and updated in 2006. It shows that poor children at grammars gain \u201caround seven to eight grade points\u201d between the ages of 11 and 16, whereas their peers improve by three to five points.\n\nThe authors confirmed to us that Ms Greening\u2019s statement is defensible on the basis of their work, which the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology described recently as \u201crobust\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s consistent with the fact that the gap in GCSE results between poor children and their peers is far smaller at grammar schools than non-selective schools. But some have said this could be mostly down to the higher attainment of the type of children who go to grammar schools.\n\nThe authors of the 2004 study also stressed to us that the benefits for children at grammars come with a negative effect on educational equality more generally. Their paper also found that children who don\u2019t make it into grammar school do worse\u2014and, crucially, very few poor children are among those who do make the grade at age 11. That\u2019s in line with what we\u2019ve found before from looking at other research.\n\nThe government often stresses that these findings apply to the grammar school system as it exists now. Any expansion of selective education would, it says, be different.", "lang": "en"}
