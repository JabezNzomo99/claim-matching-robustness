Soleimani, he said, was \u201cactively plotting in the region to take actions \u2014 a big action, as he described it \u2014 that would have put dozens, if not hundreds, of American lives at risk.\"\n\nSoleimani was on a U.N. travel sanctions list and had been sanctioned by the U.S. since 2005 as a supporter of terrorism.\n\nRussia\u2019s Foreign Ministry condemned the U.S. strike as an \u201cadventurous\u201d move that \u201cwill lead to increased tension throughout the region.\u201d Expressing \u201csincere condolences to the Iranian people,\u201d the ministry said Soleimani \u201cloyally served the cause of protecting Iran's national interests.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Soleimani met President Vladimir Putin and Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu in Moscow to discuss a Syrian military offensive against anti-government insurgents.\n\nThe Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti quoted Elena Panina, a member of the foreign affairs committee of the State Duma (the lower house of Russia\u2019s parliament), as suggesting that the President Donald Trump may have been ignorant of Soleimani\u2019s significance in Iran when ordering the strike to kill him. She suggested that Trump was tricked.\n\n\"In this situation, we cannot exclude that the American military and intelligence agencies took advantage of the story of the disturbances near the U.S. Embassy in Iraq in their corporate interests and simply framed Donald Trump, who did not fully understand the significance of the figure of Qassem Soleimani, who has the status of a national hero in Iran.\"\n\nPanina claimed Soleimani\u2019s killing was in revenge for a series of \u201chumiliating\u201d blows the U.S. suffered at the hands of the Iranian military. In particular, she cited what she called the \u201csuccessful simulation of the destruction\" of the USS Essex, a U.S. Navy amphibious assault ship, in the Persian Gulf while the head of the U.S. Central Command, U.S. Gen. Joseph Votel, was on board.\n\nThat incident took place in October 2018, when two Iranian small patrol boats approached the U.S. ship during an exercise.\n\nContrary to Panina\u2019s claim, there was nothing humiliating for the U.S. Navy in that encounter. In fact, Gen. Votel was quoted as responding to the situation with humor, and the U.S. Navy command said the Iranian boats acted safely and professionally.\n\nIn addition, what Panina described as \u201cdisturbances near the U.S. Embassy in Iraq\u201d were in reality a two-day standoff that began with Iranian-backed militiamen and their supporters attacking the embassy compound, wrecking a reception area, setting several fires and writing graffiti as they protested U.S. airstrikes on an Iran-backed militia group.\n\nThe embassy attack prompted the State Department to evacuate diplomatic personnel, the Pentagon to deploy additional troops to Iraq and Trump to lash out at Iran, saying: \u201cThey (Iran) will pay a big price. This is not a warning. It is a threat.\u201d\n\nPanina\u2019s claim that, at the time he ordered the strike, Trump was possibly ignorant of Soleimani\u2019s significance, is false.\n\nAccording to U.S. media reports, Trump's decision to allow the U.S. military to kill Soleimani was well-informed and based on weeks of consultations.\n\nAdditionally, the issue of Soleimani had already caused major criticism of Trump\u2019s candidacy during his run for the White House.\n\nIn September 2015, then-candidate Trump was unable to respond to a question from radio host Hugh Hewitt about Soleimani.\n\nAt the time, Trump\u2019s ignorance of Soleimani made the then-candidate a target of criticism both by his political rivals and the press.\n\nSoleimani had a decades-long record as a major U.S. security threat, and there were repeated calls for his elimination.\n\nPompeo told CNN that before taking the move to kill Soleimani, Trump had \u201cshown enormous restraint,\u201d while intelligence had been collected on \u201cSoleimani\u2019s travels in the region and the work that he was doing to put Americans further at risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe risk of doing nothing was enormous,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nPresident Trump said on Friday that he authorized a precision strike against Soleimani because he was plotting \u201cimminent and sinister attacks\u201d on Americans.", "lang": "en"}
