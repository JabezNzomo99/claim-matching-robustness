With five gold medals in less than three weeks on European circuits, the Dhing Express has left the Tricolour fluttering high, proving that she is the best among the best.\n\nWith Das becoming a household name amid celebrations in every nook and corner of India, a video has surfaced on social media apparently showing members of Das\u2019s family reacting after she won a gold medal.\n\nAmong others, Facebook page Chetna Manch Dhaka\u2019 posted a video last week that shows a few men, women and children sitting in a room watching TV. A few moments later, a woman breaks down and rushes out of the room.\n\nThe viral post claims that this is the reaction of Das\u2019s family members after she won a gold medal. The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be untrue.\n\nUsing keywords, we started searching for the video on Google and YouTube and found that the same video was uploaded on YouTube by one Saidur Rehman on September 3, 2018, with the caption Hima Das family\u2019.\n\nThis proves that the video is old and not after she won the gold medals last month. But then, a post in the comment section caught our eye. The post said, This is not the family of Hima Das but heptathlete Swapna Barman.\n\nWe then searched Google with the keyword Swapna Barman family\u2019 and came across this video. The video was uploaded by Hindustan Times on August 30, 2018, when Barman became the first Indian heptathlete to win a gold medal in the Asian Games. We also came across quite a few media reports regarding this.\n\nThe same video was uploaded on the India Today website as well which can be seen here.", "lang": "en"}
