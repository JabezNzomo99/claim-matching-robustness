Hon\u2019ble PM has asked me to wait. (5/5)\n\nIn a thread of five tweets, Prabhu said that he had dedicated his tenure to overcoming decades of neglect through systemic reforms leading to unprecedented investments in the railways.\n\nThe opposition has raised its pitch demanding that the minister resign after the Kaifiyat Express derailed on the intervening night of August 22 and 23 in Auraiya district of Uttar Pradesh following closely on the heels of the Kalinga-Utkal Express that derailed in Muzaffarnagar on August 19.\n\nBut there were many on Twitter who stood firmly in support of Prabhu and asked the minister to stay on.\n\nHowever, the same tweet including the short forms used in the sentence was copy pasted and tweeted several times. We found 19 posts that were identical. It is not clear whether these handles acted on their own or were instructed to do so.\n\nWhile this may seem spontaneous or a mere copycat tweet from enthusiastic supporters, organised social media campaigns either in support of a particular party or to attack the opposition are not new.\n\nAlso Read: How BJP And Congress Used A Picture Of A Potholed Road To Target Each Other\n\nAlso Read: Fake Troll Accounts Pop Up To Attack Suchitra Krishnamoorthi\u2019s Tweet On Azaan", "lang": "en"}
