No, that's not true: the story was made up by a Christian-themed satire website. It is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by The Babylon Bee on October 11, 2018 titled \"Democratic Party Now Selling Official Riot Supplies\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nU.S.--The official web store of the Democratic Party announced a slew of new products Thursday geared toward helping left-leaning voters incite riots and mob people they disagree with in public places. The Democratic National Committee proudly announced the varied offerings, including pitchforks, medieval torches, throwing rocks, and more.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nA quick look at the actual webshop shows the story is not true. Here are the products that are currently \"New\":\n\nWe checked the rest of the shop too, there is no riot gear there.\n\nWhich makes total sense since \"The Babylon Bee\" comes with following dislaimer on every page:\n\nSome of their greatest past hits include:\n\u2022 Joel Osteen Sails Luxury Yacht Through Flooded Houston To Pass Out Copies Of 'Your Best Life Now'\n\u2022 Another Actress Accuses Kirk Cameron Of Treating Her With Respect\n\u2022 ISIS Lays Down Arms After Katy Perry's Impassioned Plea To 'Like, Just Co-Exist'\n\nWith a track record like that it is clear that you shouldn't take anything posted on the site seriously and you definitely shouldn't confuse it with real news.\n\nWe wrote about babylonbee.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Senate NOT On Lockdown After Receiving Credible Threat From Known Killers\n\u2022 Fake News: Bill Clinton Did NOT Say Allegations Of Sexual Misconduct Should Disqualify A Man From Public Office\n\u2022 Fake News: Hurricane Florence NOT Now Expected To Ricochet Off Nation's Hedge Of Protection\n\u2022 Fake News: Michelle Wolf Did NOT Ink New Deals With Hulu, Amazon, Did NOT Get Cancelled Immediately\n\u2022 Fake News: Pope Did NOT Say He Will Address Sex Abuse Scandal Once He's Finished Talking About Climate Change", "lang": "en"}
