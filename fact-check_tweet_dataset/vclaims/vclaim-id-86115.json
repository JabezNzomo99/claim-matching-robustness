(In court, Cohen said he took action \u201cat the request of the candidate\u201d and knew it was illegal.) In August 2016, McDougal was paid $150,000 by AMI for the rights to her story \u2014 which the National Enquirer never published.\n\nThe lie evolves: Cohen made the payments on his own\n\nTrump\u2019s spokesmen keep saying he \u2018was not aware of any of it\u2019\n\nThe lie shifts again: Trump \u2018did know about the general arrangement\u2019\n\nWhat we know now: This was a lie. Cohen did not get repaid through a monthly retainer. He sought reimbursement for the payment, and the Trump Organization agreed to pay $420,000, at a monthly rate of $35,000, according to court filings. The company then falsely listed the payments in its books as a retainer for legal work. \u201cIn truth and in fact, there was no such retainer agreement, and the monthly invoices Cohen submitted were not in connection for any legal services he had provided in 2017,\u201d prosecutors wrote.", "lang": "en"}
