{"title": "False: Markaz Attendee Thrashed By Cops For Misbehaving With Hospital Staff", "subtitle": "A viral post claims that police thrashed a markaz attendee for misbehaving with hospital staff in Ghaziabad. BOOM found that the image was old, and the caption unrelated", "author": "www.boomlive.in", "date": "2020-04-12T15:23:16+05:30", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-55799", "url": "https://www.boomlive.in/fake-news/false-markaz-attendee-thrashed-by-cops-for-misbehaving-with-hospital-staff-7647", "vclaim": "An old image showing a youth with a bruised back has gone viral on social media falsely claiming it as police action on a Muslim youth for misbehaving with hospital staff. BOOM traced the picture to July 2019 and found the claims to be unrelated.\n\nA Hindi caption with the viral post reads 'Cops made permanent tattoos on a markaz patient who was walking naked in front of a nurse and abusing the hospital staff. Mohammed Mustafa, Mohammed Gulrez, Shoe and Majid were also booked under NSA for nudity'. The post also uses Islamophobic hashtags.\n\nBOOM also found out that National Security Act had been slapped against the four persons mentioned in the post. However, the action had not been initiated for nudity - as mentioned in the post - but for provoking the residents of Tat Patti Bakhal, Indore, Madhya Pradesh to attack a team of doctors who were visiting the area to screen a Coronavirus patient on April 1.

Check the archived version of Live Hindustan's post here.\n\nThe caption with the Hindi portal's photo reads 'People are quarantined because of the lockdown. However, some people in Devghar are not ready to follow rules. Due to this, police thrashed a youth leaving his back bruised. Police force has been appealing people to stay at home during lockdown but some of them are not ready to oblige'. The caption has linked the photo with lockdown in Devghar, Bihar.\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search on the photo and found it on some Facebook posts shared in 2019.\n\nOn July 17 last year, Facebook page Govt. Commerce College, Chittagong had shared the same photo without any caption.\n\nThe same photo was shared from another Facebook page with a sarcastic caption in Bangla. This post contains another picture showing the face of the injured youth.\n\nBOOM could not independently verify where the picture is originally from but we could track it back to last year, which means the claims linking it to the Tablighi Jamat markaz and lockdown are false.", "lang": "en"}
