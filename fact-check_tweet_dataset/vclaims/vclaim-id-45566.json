However, India TV, on Monday, issued a correction mentioning that it was a \u201chuman error\u201d on the channel\u2019s part. Modi did not make any such claim about treatment of coronavirus patients, rather he quoted the one crore figure in context to the beneficiaries of the Ayushman Bharat scheme. You can view the archived version here. Several Twitter users took a dig at the prime minister by comparing the figure mentioned in the viral image and the total numbers of COVID-19 cases in India.

Two clues that helped us establish this were the time stamp in the bulletin, ie, Sunday, 11:24 am and that India TV uploaded bulletin on the same day in which the channel used the same image of Modi as seen in the viral graphic. We could then find an apology which was issued by the news channel on Monday. The correction stated that due to a \u201chuman error\u201d, it was erroneously reported that as many as one crore Indians have been treated with coronavirus. \u201cWe want to clarify that India has not reported so many coronavirus cases. The error is regretted.\u201d the tweet added. PM\u2019s Letter to People, Mann Ki Baat: From Abstract to Political\n\nFurther, in Sunday\u2019s \u2018Mann Ki Baat\u2019 episode, while elaborating on the Ayushman Bharat scheme, Modi, from 18:03 minutes onwards, can be heard saying that over a crore people have benefitted from the scheme in a span of one and a half years. \u201cA few days ago, the number of beneficiaries of 'Ayushman Bharat' scheme crossed over one crore. More than one crore patients implies that more than one crore families of our country have been served,\u201d reads the transcript of the address on Modi\u2019s official website. As per the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, India has 97,581 active cases, 95,526 people have been cured or discharged and 5,598 have died due to coronavirus. Evidently, a screenshot of India TV\u2019s bulletin is being shared to claim that the prime minister said that one crore patients have been treated for free.
