It was at this point that contact with Vikram lander was lost with the ground station.\n\nThese incidents happened in a braking sequence called 'fine braking', which followed a period of powered descent called 'rough braking'. The phase was the last fifteen minutes of the landing sequence before Vikram would touch the lunar surface. \n\n\n\nVikram's landing sequence was scheduled to start 1:40 am on September 7. It consisted of the rover 'Pragyan', which was supposed to go onto the lunar surface around 3 hours later.\n\nBoth ISRO and its chairman Dr. K. Sivan have made these announcements, that can be seen below.\n\nNASA data shows Israel\u2019s Baresheet mission too unsuccessfully attempted to land the first mission by a private company in April 2019. From 1958 to 2019, 109 moon missions were launched out of which 61 were successful and 48 were not. This indicates about 60% success rate for lunar missions launched by countries around the world.\n\nWhat is next?\n\nBoth Dr. Sivan's announcement and ISRO's statement has said that certain data is being analysed.\n\nWhile ISRO has not yet put out more details on this, former ISRO director D Sasikumar has told ANI:\n\nWe have to find out from communications data whether it is a soft landing or it is a crash landing. In my opinion, it is not a crash landing because the communication channel is on between the lander and the orbiter. It should be intact. So, let us hope after the analysis is done, we may be able to find the final figure.\n\nThis communication data will help ISRO unveil the events that occurred in the last fifteen minutes of landing.\n\nWhile information is awaited on the course of action that ISRO will take on Chandrayaan 2, the mission to the moon Chandrayaan 3 is already in the works, expected to be around 2024.\n\nISRO's 'Aditya' mission is also scheduled to study the sun with the satellite to be launched in 2019 - 2020, reportedly in collaboration with Japan. A 'Gaganyaan' mission is scheduled to be India's first manned space mission, launching in 2021.\n\nThe Chandrayaan-2 mission had three components:\n\nWhile communication has been lost with the lander that consisted of the rover, the orbiter has successfully been put in the lunar orbit. Vikram and the orbiter split paths on September 3.\n\nISRO, in a press release, has said that 90 - 95% of the mission objectives have been accomplished due to the safety of the orbiter, which will be in a 100 kilometer orbit of the moon. Also, due to the precision of the mission, the life of the mission will now be 7 years instead of the planned one year.\n\nInternational scientific correspondents have also cautioned against making premature conclusions without hearing further from ISRO. \n\n\n\nWhat has been the response from around the world?\n\nThe Chandrayaan 2 mission and ISRO have received praised for the mission despite the setback from leaders from around the world and from the scientific community.\n\nNASA scientists and scientific journalists have tweeted on the mission.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi not only consoled an emotional Dr. Sivan, he also addressed ISRO scientists, encouraging them to move beyond the setback to ensure success in future.\n\nThe mission has also received commendations from global leaders.", "lang": "en"}
