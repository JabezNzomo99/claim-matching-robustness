Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan, a Republican, said earlier this year that his conference wants to \"get rid of\" the program.\n\nLawmakers were especially critical of Start-Up NY after the state spent $53 million in advertising to promote it between 2013 and 2015. The program created 408 net new jobs by the end of 2015 after launching in January 2014.\n\nIs Kolb right that this year\u2019s budget also includes money to advertise Start-Up NY?\n\nThe part of the budget Kolb referred to funds more than advertising for Start-Up NY.\n\nThe bill sets aside $44.5 million to support the state\u2019s economic development initiatives, including Start-Up NY, primarily through marketing and promotion. It also pays for the state's effort to promote New York state as a tourism destination and is also available to bolster some of the state\u2019s other economic development programs. The Global NY program, for example, connects businesses in New York state to international companies.\n\nEmpire State Development, the state\u2019s economic development agency, has not spent money to advertise Start-Up NY for three years and has no plans to do so, said Jason Conwall, an agency spokesman.\n\nThe funding line is a holdover from the 2014 budget, the first to earmark advertising money for the program. The same line has been included, almost verbatim, in each budget since.\n\nThat\u2019s not uncommon in the state budget. The document spans thousands of pages and includes 10 bills that allocate more than $160 billion. It\u2019s routine for staff who write the bills to copy and paste language from the year before.\n\nDuring budget votes, bills are delivered in the middle of the night with emergency \"messages of necessity\" from the governor. Members of the Assembly and Senate have to vote on the bills that are in front of them, said Michael Fraser, who\u2019s Kolb\u2019s director of communications.\n\nKolb\u2019s claim about Start-Up NY came immediately after the final budget passed, near 4 a.m., Fraser said.\n\n\"We don\u2019t have the luxury of getting promises from agencies about what they may or may not do,\" Fraser said. \"Frankly, what\u2019s actually in the law far outweighs what\u2019s said after the fact.\n\n\"What we do know is that the bill clearly mentions Start-Up NY by name,\" he said. \"It presents a very specific percentage of funds that would be used outside New York.\"\n\nThat is specifically written into the bill, Fraser said.\n\nHe made a comparison to school district funding. Most district are not listed by name.\n\n\"School aid is presented as a lump-sum of money that we know will flow to every school district in the state, but that\u2019s not explicitly spelled out,\" he said.\n\nKolb said the state budget directs millions of dollars to advertise the Start-Up NY program.\n\nIt\u2019s true that a line in the budget allows the state to use money to advertise Start-Up NY. But state officials use the same pot of money to promote tourism and other programs in the state. While the bill may include language about where advertising money can be spent, if the agency chooses to advertise the program, nothing in the budget bill requires the Cuomo administration to spend money on Start-Up NY advertising. The agency that would create and run ads for Start-Up NY says it has no plans to use the money for that purpose.\n\nKolb\u2019s statement that the budget directs millions of dollars to be spent advertising the program is not accurate. We rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
