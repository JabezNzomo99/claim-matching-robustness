They blocked the Iowa caucus. We are winning so hard the Democrats are shutting down the damn entire primary process. #PresidentSanders #IowaCaucas\"\n\nProblems surfaced in Iowa both with a widely anticipated pre-caucus poll and reporting the results of the Democratic caucuses.\n\nBut no evidence has surfaced to suggest the problems were the result of Democrats \"blocking\" efforts to poll or caucus \u2014 and certainly not within the first few chaos-filled hours after the caucusing ended.\n\nResults of the final CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll were scheduled to be released Feb. 2, two days before the caucuses.\n\nThe New York Times reported that the decision not to release the results was made after the campaign for Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg said that an Iowa supporter received a poll phone call from an operator working for the Register\u2019s polling operation, but that the name of the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., was not listed on the menu of options. One operator had apparently enlarged the font size on their computer screen, perhaps cutting off Buttigieg\u2019s name from the list of options, according to two people interviewed by the Times.\n\nOther news media, including Politico, also reported that Buttigieg\u2019s campaign had raised the issue and that the font change apparently was the problem.\n\nThe Register\u2019s executive editor, Carol Hunter, explained the decision in a Feb. 1 article, saying \"it appears (Buttigieg\u2019s) name was omitted in at least one interview in which the respondent was asked to name their preferred candidate,\" and that the omission \"could have compromised the results of the poll.\"\n\nThe second part of the statement undoubtedly refers to the unprecedented delay in the reporting of the results of Democratic caucuses.\n\nBy midday the following day (Feb. 4), the Iowa Democratic Party was saying it expected to release some results by 5 p.m. that day.\n\nAt that point, news organizations were reporting that the delays were caused by technical problems \u2014 both with an app and with a telephone system that had been set up as a backup for the electronic reporting of caucus tallies. People who called experienced long delays or couldn\u2019t get through at all.\n\nNo evidence had surfaced that the delay was due to Democrats \"blocking\" the poll or caucus.\n\nWe messaged Organizers for Bernie 2020, but didn\u2019t get a reply.\n\nA Sanders campaign spokeswoman told us the group has no relationship with the campaign. She had no comment on the claim we\u2019re checking.\n\nA social media post said Democrats \"blocked the Iowa poll\" and \"blocked the Iowa caucus.\"\n\nResults of the final Des Moines Register poll before the caucuses were not released because of a possible error by one operator who did the telephone polling.\n\nTechnical problems with an app and a phone system were blamed for the unprecedented delay in reporting the Democratic caucus results.", "lang": "en"}
