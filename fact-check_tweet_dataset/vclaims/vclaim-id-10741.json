It fell by about 35% between 2009/10 and 2015/16 according to membership body the Association of Colleges. That doesn\u2019t account for inflation\u2014the fall is about 41% accounting for it.\n\nJeremy Corbyn and the Prime Minister also clashed over funding for 16 to 19 year olds in this exchange, which happened at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions. We\u2019re looking into this separately and will be publishing a factcheck on it shortly.\n\nFunding for adult skills fell by about 40%\n\nThe way in which adult skills have been funded has changed over the past five or so years.\n\nPreviously funding was split into classroom-based provision\u2014known as the \u2018adult learner responsive\u2019 budget\u2014and employer-based provision\u2014known as the \u2018employer responsive\u2019 budget. These were brought together into a single Adult Skills Budget from 2011/12.\n\nCombining the classroom-based funding with the employer-based funding, and including apprenticeships for people aged 19 and over, spending was about \u00a33.1 billion in 2009/10. That fell to around \u00a32 billion in the Adult Skills Budget provision for 2015/16, or around \u00a31.8 billion in 2009/10 prices.\n\nThe 41% fall includes a 14% decline in 2015/16. Funding for adult skills outside of apprenticeships was hit particularly hard in that year.\n\nSome programmes were cut from the budget over this period. For example, the government announced in 2010 that it was abolishing the Train to Gain programme in order to \u201csignificantly lower the overall cost of the further education system\u201d.\n\nThe programme supported employers to improve the skills of their employees. Some of the budget for this programme was diverted to adult apprenticeships in 2010/11.\n\nOverall funding on adult skills is expected to increase over this Parliament\n\nThe Adult Skills Budget has now become the \u2018Adult Education Budget\u2019, which incorporates the Adult Skills Budget along with other post-18 skills budgets, but doesn\u2019t pay for apprenticeships.\n\nThat Adult Education Budget is being protected in cash terms over the current Parliament. That won\u2019t protect it from inflation.\n\nOther funding will increase. The adult apprenticeships budget is expected to see an above inflation increase, rising from around \u00a3770 million in 2015/16 to \u00a31.5 billion in 2019/20.\n\nThe government is also extending the loans system for students in further education.\n\nThe government says that in combination, its plans mean an above-inflation increase in funding for adult skills over this Parliament.", "lang": "en"}
