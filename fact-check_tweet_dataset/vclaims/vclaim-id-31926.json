The hoarding of wealth is the cause of poverty. The rich aren\u2019t just indifferent to poverty; they create it and maintain it.\u201d\n\nThere is no indication that Foster ever said this quote.\n\nThis meme suggests that Foster does not live by her own political philosophy, first attributing the quote to her, then pointing out that she herself is well off. Beneath the quote, the image claims that she has a net worth of $100 million, though The Daily Caller could not independently verify whether this figure is accurate or not.\n\nNonetheless, the Caller found no proof that Foster ever said this \u2013 to reporters, on camera or anywhere else.\n\nThe meme does not provide a source or date for the remark, but it has been circulating on social media for years, at times with no attribution to Foster.\n\nFoster does occasionally wade into politics \u2013 she has protested against President Donald Trump and directed an ad for the 2018 midterm elections, backed by Independence USA, a PAC funded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cI have a thousand opinions, and I certainly give money and do a lot of things behind the scenes,\u201d Foster said in a 2018 interview with IndieWire, \u201cbut it\u2019s not my personality to believe that celebrities have the expertise to try to influence other people\u2019s ideas or their feelings, politically.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
