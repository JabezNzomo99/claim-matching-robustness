No, that's not true: According to the grocery company, face coverings are required to enter its stores.\n\nThe claim appeared as a meme in a post (archived here) shared on Facebook on July 27, 2020. The post started with the introduction \"ALDI showing great common sense and a love for humanity. You have my vote! I've received a quick response from the appropriate department.\" This was followed by a purported statement from the grocery chain that read:\n\nWe wish to advise that ALDI has taken the stance that it is not up to our staff to enforce the law as this is the job of the police. Therefore, ALDI does not have the wearing of face masks as a condition of entry to the store. This means that if peple enter our stores without wearing a face mask, this is at their own risk and they won't be stopped or asked to leave, etc.\n\nThis is what the post looked like at the time of writing:\n\nAn official statement from Aldi contradicts the post's claim.\n\nOn July 17, 2020, the company issued a statement outlining its new face covering policy. This is what it said:\n\nThe grocery chain encouraged those shoppers either unable or unwilling to wear a mask to visit its website to place an order for grocery delivery or curbside pickup.\n\nAldi joins a growing list of companies requiring shoppers to wear masks in stores. Lead Stories has covered some myths surrounding those companies and their policies.\n\u2022 Fact Check: Meijer DOES Now Require Masks Of All People Shopping In Company Stores\n\u2022 Fact Check: Walmart Can And Does Require All Shoppers To Wear Face Masks; 'Reference Number' Will Not Exempt You", "lang": "en"}
