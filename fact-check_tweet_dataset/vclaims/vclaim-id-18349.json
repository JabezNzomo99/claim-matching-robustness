The quote actually comes from a tweet on a parody Twitter account.\n\n\u201cDear America: You are waking up, as Germany once did, to the awareness that 1/3 of your people would kill another 1/3, while 1/3 watches,\u201d reads the alleged quote.\n\nThe Facebook post attributes the statement to Herzog, the award-winning German director behind documentary films such as \u201cGrizzly Man\u201d and \u201cEncounters at the End of the World.\u201d\n\nLucki Stipetic, executive chairman of the Werner Herzog Foundation, told The Daily Caller in an email, \u201cWerner Herzog never made this statement.\u201d\n\nA quick Google search reveals the quote actually comes from an August 2017 tweet made by a parody Twitter account called @WernerTwertzog. The account describes itself in its bio as \u201cWerner Herzog\u2019s unpaid internet stooge.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, The Caller found no verified Twitter for the filmmaker \u2013 and Herzog has told media outlets that he does not have a Twitter account in the past.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not on social media, but you will find me in the social media,\u201d Herzog told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s Facebook, there\u2019s Twitters, but it\u2019s all not me. It\u2019s fake Herzogs.\u201d\n\nHerzog has spoken about President Donald Trump in the past. According to IndieWire, Herzog said during a talk at the Pratt Institute in 2017, \u201cAmerica is still a democracy and no matter whether you like or dislike the current government or president, America has an amazing ability to rejuvenate itself and to learn and move on. It\u2019s a young country and I don\u2019t see what you call fascism. I think it\u2019s too far fetched.\u201d\n\nIn another interview, however, Herzog asked not to discuss politics.", "lang": "en"}
