Comey, in written congressional testimony on June 8, says he was tasked to pull Trump aside and brief him on the contents of an unverified dossier that was \u201cpersonally sensitive\u201d to the president-elect. \u201cBased on President-elect Trump\u2019s reaction to the briefing and without him directly asking the question,\u201d Comey tells Trump he is not the subject of an open counter-intelligence investigation. After the meeting, Comey immediately wrote a memo about the conversation as sson as he returned to his car. \u201cI was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting, and so I thought it really important to document,\u201d he told lawmakers.\n\nComey\u2019s version (from Benjamin Wittes, \u201cWhat James Comey Told Me About Donald Trump,\u201d May 18): \u201cHe tried hard to blend into the background and avoid any one-on-one interaction. He was wearing a blue blazer and noticed that the drapes were blue. So he stood in the back, right in front of the drapes, hoping Trump wouldn\u2019t notice him camouflaged against the wall. \u2026 Comey took the long walk across the room determined, he told me, that there was not going to be a hug. Bad enough that he was there; bad enough that there would be a handshake; he emphatically did not want any show of warmth. Again, look at the video, and you\u2019ll see Comey preemptively reaching out to shake hands. Trump grabs his hand and attempts an embrace. The embrace, however, is entirely one sided. Comey was disgusted. He regarded the episode as a physical attempt to show closeness and warmth in a fashion calculated to compromise him before Democrats who already mistrusted him.\u201d\n\nComey\u2019s version (from written congressional testimony, June 8): \u201cThe President began by asking me whether I wanted to stay on as FBI Director, which I found strange \u2026.My instincts told me that the one-on-one setting, and the pretense that this was our first discussion about my position, meant the dinner was, at least in part, an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship. That concerned me greatly, given the FBI\u2019s traditionally independent status in the executive branch\u2026.I added that I was not on anybody\u2019s side politically and could not be counted on in the traditional political sense, a stance I said was in his best interest as the President. A few moments later, the President said, \u2018I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.\u2019 I didn\u2019t move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence\u2026..Near the end of our dinner, the President returned to the subject of my job\u2026.He then said, \u2018I need loyalty.\u2019 I replied, \u2018You will always get honesty from me.\u2019 He paused and then said, \u2018That\u2019s what I want, honest loyalty.\u2019 I paused, and then said, \u2018You will get that from me.\u2019\u201d\n\nComey\u2019s version (from written congressional testimony, June 8): \u201cOn February 14, I went to the Oval Office for a scheduled counterterrorism briefing of the President,\u201d Comey said in his congressional testimony. \u201cThe President signaled the end of the briefing by thanking the group and telling them all that he wanted to speak to me alone\u2026.When the door by the grandfather clock closed, and we were alone, the President began by saying, \u2018I want to talk about Mike Flynn.\u2019 \u2026 The President began by saying Flynn hadn\u2019t done anything wrong in speaking with the Russians, but he had to let him go because he had misled the Vice President. He added that he had other concerns about Flynn, which he did not then specify\u2026 \u2018He is a good guy and has been through a lot.\u2019 He repeated that Flynn hadn\u2019t done anything wrong on his calls with the Russians, but had misled the Vice President. He then said, \u2018I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.\u2019 I replied only that \u2018he is a good guy.\u2019 \u2026I did not say I would \u2018let this go.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the morning of March 30, the President called me at the FBI. He described the Russia investigation as \u2018a cloud\u2019 that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country. He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia. He asked what we could do to \u2018lift the cloud.\u2019\u2026 I explained that we had briefed the leadership of Congress on exactly which individuals we were investigating and that we had told those Congressional leaders that we were not personally investigating President Trump. I reminded him I had previously told him that. He repeatedly told me, \u2018We need to get that fact out.\u2019\u2026 The President went on to say that if there were some \u2018satellite\u2019 associates of his who did something wrong, it would be good to find that out, but that he hadn\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the morning of April 11, the President called me and asked what I had done about his request that I \u2018get out\u2019 that he is not personally under investigation. I replied that I had passed his request to the Acting Deputy Attorney General, but I had not heard back. He replied that \u2018the cloud\u2019 was getting in the way of his ability to do his job\u2026. I said the White House Counsel should contact the leadership of DOJ to make the request, which was the traditional channel. He said he would do that and added, \u2018Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing you know.\u2019 I did not reply or ask him what he meant by \u2018that thing.\u2019 I said only that the way to handle it was to have the White House Counsel call the Acting Deputy Attorney General. He said that was what he would do and the call ended.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
