The caption says, \u201cBreaking News: Apparently, France has discovered the vaccine for Corona virus. Many jubilate to hear the wonderful news!\u201d ( here ) This claim is false.\n\nThe video does not show hospital workers in France, as the video\u2019s caption says. It was filmed in Spain. The video in the false claim includes a TikTok logo but it remains unclear who originally filmed the footage.\n\nThe video actually shows the Clinical and Provincial Hospital of Barcelona. At the start of the video, the words \u201cHospital Clinic\u201d are visible on the glass doors. Located at 170 Carrer de Villarroel, the clinic can be viewed on Google Street View ( here!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sc5IeUB5wWhrpssZwxrxywQ!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo3.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3Dc5IeUB5wWhrpssZwxrxywQ%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D262.29077%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192 ), with the same street surroundings visible in the clinic\u2019s proximity on Google as in the video.\n\nFootage of the same clinic and a similar scene from a different angle can be found on NBC News who say, \u201cCitizens of Barcelona expressed their gratitude and appreciation for the efforts being made by doctors and nurses treating COVID-19 at Hospital Clinic, the city\u2019s main hospital. The daily tribute to health workers during the ongoing health crisis in Spain takes place at 8 p.m. throughout the country.\u201d ( here ) Based on the number of workers outside the clinic in the NBC video, it is probable that it was filmed during this nightly ritual.\n\nThe claim that France has discovered the vaccine for coronavirus is also false. As stated here on the World Health Organization (WHO) website, \u201cTo date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019...Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19.\u201d\n\nThe French biomedical research agency INSERM announced on March 22, 2020 that it would coordinate a clinical trial including at least 800 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in France ( here ). Planning to include 3,200 European patients from Belgium, France, Germany Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, INSERM says the trial will \u201ccomplement the data that will be collected as part of another international clinical trial that will soon begin under the auspices of the World Health Organization, called Solidarity.\u201d\n\nFalse: This video shows hospital workers in Spain, not France. There is currently no vaccine for COVID-19.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our fact checking work here .", "lang": "en"}
