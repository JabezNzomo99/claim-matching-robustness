Mimi Walters connected her challenger Katie Porter to Democrats who have voiced support for abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE.\n\nBut how true is Walters\u2019 attack?\n\nThe mailer from Walters to residents of California\u2019s 45th Congressional District claims the \"press has reported that Katie Porter is part of a radical group of Democrats running for Congress\" and says she has an \"extreme agenda\" that supports abolishing ICE.\n\nIt goes on to criticize Porter for supporting sanctuary city laws and that she wants free college and Medicare for illegal immigrants.\n\nFor the purposes of this fact-check, we focused on the claim that Porter\u2019s agenda includes abolishing ICE.\n\nWhat media reports is the mailer referring to?\n\nThe Walters campaign told us that the ICE charge comes from a McClatchy DC bureau article from Sept. 14. But the news story doesn\u2019t back up the mailer\u2019s claim.\n\nMcClatchy reported that Porter is part of a \"battery\" of \"even more liberal\" candidates pushing for single-payer health care and abolishing ICE.\n\nThe original version of the article had a sentence that said Porter and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York have both \"pushed the ideological envelope for the party\u2019s progressive wing, even popularizing once-radical positions like single-payer health care or abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.\" This line was featured on the mailer.\n\nHowever, that reference was updated and clarified in the story three days later. (We spoke with McClatchy reporter Alex Roarty, who confirmed the change.)\n\nThe section now reads that the candidates have \"pushed the ideological envelope for the party\u2019s progressive wing. Porter has embraced the once-radical position of single-payer health care while Ocasio-Cortez supports abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.\"\n\nPerhaps a minor alteration in the story, but it\u2019s a big hit on the accuracy of the mailer\u2019s claim that Porter wants to abolish ICE.\n\nWhat Katie Porter has said about ICE\n\nDemocrats have argued in the past that ICE, which formed in the aftermath of 9/11, needs to be abolished to prevent mistreatment of undocumented immigrants. But the notion gained new life over the summer amid stories of migrant children being separated from their families at the U.S. border.\n\nPorter\u2019s campaign said she does not want to abolish ICE. We did not find evidence that she has called for ending the agency like some other candidates.\n\nThe campaign pointed us to a Mercury News article from August.\n\nThe story discusses how none of the Democrats running in the 10 most competitive House races in California support dissolving the agency, citing a survey of the candidates.\n\nIt then lists each candidate\u2019s comments on ICE, and quotes Porter saying that the immigration agency \"should be focused on its core public safety mission, not targeting families. The real issue here is the failure of Donald Trump\u2019s leadership.\"\n\nOn her campaign website, Porter says that she believes the U.S. needs immigration reform \"that will provide a fair pathway to citizenship for those who are undocumented.\"\n\nWalters claimed that Porter has an extreme liberal agenda that supports abolishing ICE.\n\nThe mailer relies on a news article that said she supports such actions, but that piece has since been updated, stopping short of saying the Democrat wants to do away with the agency and mentioning her position for single-payer health care instead.\n\nWe also found comments from Porter expressing frustration with the agency, and that she supports changes to it, but not dissolving it completely.\n\nThe claim is inaccurate, so we rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
