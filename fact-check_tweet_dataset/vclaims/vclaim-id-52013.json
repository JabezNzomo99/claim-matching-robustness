Those who wish, can watch it here. Viewer discretion is advised.]\n\nAlt News has received several fact-check requests on its official mobile application.\n\nAlt News broke down the video into multiple keyframes using InVid and performed a reverse image search on Google. This led us to a tweet where the same clip was shared by a Pakistani user on April 1. Another user replied to this tweet and wrote that the two men responsible for the brutal act have been arrested.\n\nThe same video was also uploaded on YouTube on March 24. As per the description, one Noman Shahid was attacked in Pakistan\u2019s Gojra district. The description also carried the words \u201d Chak 179 GB.\u201d\n\nA subsequent keyword search led us to reports by Pakistani media outlets. The incident was reported by The Nationon March 25: \u201cTwo men allegedly chopped both legs and both arms of a boy of Chak 179 GB, Gojra on Tuesday.\u201d Gojra is located in Pakistan\u2019s Toba Tek Singh in Punjab.\n\nAccording to a report in The Express Tribune from March 31, the man was attacked by his in-laws with an axe because they disapproved of his marriage to a woman in their family. The survivor, who was critically injured, was identified as Noman Shahid. The woman he married was Sana Bibi.\n\n\u201cThe case was lodged by the victim\u2019s father Shahid Riaz. Police arrested Rizwan and Shahid and started a search for their accomplices. A police official said the third suspect, Arsalan, is hiding in southern Punjab,\u201d the report further states.\n\nThe incident was also covered by Indian media. According to PTI, the man was 23 years of age and was left without a limb in the attack. Police officer Waqar Shoaib Qureshi said that Noman was admitted at Faisalabad Allied Hospital\u2019s intensive care unit.\n\nTherefore, a video of honour-based violence in Pakistan\u2019s Punjab was falsely linked to an incident in Rajasthan\u2019s Jaisalmer where a man was allegedly hacked to death by a group of Muslim men.", "lang": "en"}
