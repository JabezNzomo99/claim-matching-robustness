On 14 August, the remarks formed part of a Dallas Morning News column by former Texas State Senator Jerry Patterson, who wrote:\n\nDuring his famous debates with Sen. Stephen Douglas, Lincoln explained to the crowd: \u201cI am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races \u2026 I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of Negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races from living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be a position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.\u201d Lincoln was no different than most white males, North and South, at the time. He was a white supremacist.\n\nThe quote as presented by Patterson, and in several Facebook and Twitter posts, is authentic. Lincoln did make those remarks on 18 September 1858. They came at the beginning of his opening speech at the fourth of seven famous debates with Stephen Douglas, during Lincoln\u2019s unsuccessful campaign for the U.S. Senate in Illinois. Lincoln had been under attack from Democrats who accused him of supporting racial equality, and his comments were a defense against those allegations.\n\nThere is no official transcript of those debates, and the accounts published at the time in two Illinois newspapers \u2014 the Republican Chicago Press and Tribune and the Democratic Chicago Times \u2014 often diverged along partisan lines, according to Rodney Davis and Douglas Wilson\u2019s annotated \u201cLincoln-Douglas Debates\u201d (page vii.)\n\nNonetheless, here are the most relevant remarks, as reported in the pro-Lincoln Chicago Press and Tribune on 21 September 1858. You can read that day\u2019s report in full here.\n\nDespite the frequent spinning of the speeches by both newspapers, there appears to be consensus on Lincoln\u2019s Charleston remarks regarding racial equality. The Chicago Times report, reprinted in Harold Holzer\u2019s 1993 Lincoln-Douglas Debates, does not significantly vary from that published by the Press and Tribune:\n\nI will say then, that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters of the negroes, or jurors, or qualifying them to hold office, of having them to marry with white people. I will say in addition, that there is a physical difference between the white and black races, which I suppose, will forever forbid the two races living together upon terms of social and political equality, and inasmuch, as they cannot so live, that while they do remain together, there must be the position of superior and inferior, that I as much as any other man am in favor of the superior position being assigned to the white man.\n\nOf course, this excerpt from one speech does not represent the totality of Lincoln\u2019s views on race and racial equality, but the remarks were far from a complete outlier, and Lincoln\u2019s views were more complex and uncomfortable than the prevalent modern impression of him as the racially-enlightened Great Emancipator.\n\nWe spoke to Columbia University historian Eric Foner, author of several books on Lincoln, including The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that: one, before the Civil War, Lincoln hated slavery. He always did,\u201d Foner told us:\n\nDuring the Civil War, Foner says, Lincoln\u2019s views evolved radically as he was exposed to black people such as Frederick Douglass, who were far more talented than he had assumed, and as the efforts of freed slaves in the Union army earned them, in Lincoln\u2019s view, the right to citizenship.\n\nJust before his death, Lincoln gave a speech in which he mentioned the possibility of giving black Union soldiers and wealthy black elites the right to vote, in direct contradiction to his 1858 remarks. And yet, Foner told us, for a long time Lincoln\u2019s plan for black people in the United States largely consisted of arranging for them to the leave the country and set up colonies elsewhere.\n\nFoner also warned against overemphasizing the importance of ethnicity to Lincoln by isolating specific racist remarks he made:\n\n\u201cWhereas abolition was a central aspect of Lincoln\u2019s moral compass\u201d, the Harvard historian Henry Louis Gates wrote in 2009, \u201cracial equality was not\u201d:", "lang": "en"}
