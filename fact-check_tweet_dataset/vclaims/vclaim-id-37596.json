The post is misleading: the video is at least eight months old and can be traced back to social media reports about an incident that has no reported links to the election.\n\nThe Facebook post, which has been viewed more than 1.3 million times since it was posted on January 9, 2019, contains a video of a man slapping another man in the face alongside a screenshot of an Indonesian news report.\n\nThe media report is dated November 12, 2018, and features the logo of Jakarta-based news outlet Poskotanews.com. It is headlined: \u201cOfficials have started to record data of mentally-ill patients for election voters\u2019 list\u201d.\n\nPoskotanews.com did publish an article with an identical headline on November 12.\n\nThe article\u2019s first paragraph says: \u201cOfficials from Bekasi\u2019s electoral commission, election monitoring agency and municipal administration visited the Jamrud Biru mental health rehabilitation center November 12 to record patients\u2019 electronic data for the 2019 election voters list.\u201d\n\nThe article does not contain any video clip and there is no evidence to suggest the footage in the misleading Facebook post is linked to the Poskotannews article.\n\nThere is also no evidence suggesting the video shows what is reported in the Poskotanews.com article.\n\nThe video clip has circulated online since at least April 2018.\n\nThe earliest version AFP found of the video was here, on the Dampit TV Facebook page on April 28, 2018.\n\nThe Facebook post is captioned: \u201cBe careful when you sit in a mental hospital. Make sure you\u2019re not slapped in the face.\u201d\n\nIt was then published in this April 29, 2018 article by Indonesia\u2019s Liputan6.com.\n\nThe Liputan6.com article was titled \u201cVIDEO: This man was slapped in the face by a mental hospital patient\u201d.\n\nNeither story mentions any links between the video and election-related activities.", "lang": "en"}
