The Trump International Hotel Las Vegas does not appear to be one of them, according to one news investigation.\n\nLike most other U.S. governors in spring 2020, Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak on March 20 ordered all nonessential businesses to close \u2014 including Las Vegas\u2019 many casinos and hotels \u2014 and urged residents to stay home to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease.\n\nMeanwhile, a growing number of Nevada nurses, doctors, firefighters, and other first responders who have been treating COVID-19 patients sought alternative housing arrangements to prevent the spread of the virus to their own family members or housemates.\n\nIn early April 2020, Facebook users began sharing posts with the claim: \u201cAll Las Vegas hotels have donated food and rooms for emergency personnel except for one: Trump International Hotel Las Vegas.\u201d Additionally, one Twitter user posted the statement with a photograph of the Trump hotel.\n\nWe received numerous inquiries at Snopes asking about the veracity of the claim.\n\nFirstly, the Trump Organization \u2014 which owns the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas, as well as six hotels in other cities and a dozen U.S. country clubs \u2014 does not appear to be offering rooms nor donating food to Las Vegas first responders. According to a ProPublica investigation, which analyzed all of the organization\u2019s properties, no evidence suggests the group is offering to help people who are the frontlines of the global pandemic.\n\n\u201cIt is possible that the Trumps have engaged in unseen acts of charity connected to the pandemic,\u201d the ProPublica story reads. \u201cThe Trumps, however, have not been known to hide deeds for which they might receive favorable public attention.\u201d\n\nAccording to the investigation, the Trumps\u2019 64-story, 1,282-room hotel in Las Vegas closed its doors in mid-March, complying with the governor\u2019s order. A person who answered the hotel\u2019s main phone number on April 13 confirmed with Snopes that the hotel remains closed. The person said no one was available to take media inquiries nor comment on whether the hotel was donating rooms or food.\n\nAcross the city, the abrupt shuttering of hotels and casinos in late March \u201cprovided huge quantities of unused food to the area\u2019s Three Square Food Bank,\u201d which helps low-income people get meals across Southern Nevada.\n\nThe nonprofit\u2019s chief operating officer, Larry Scott, told ProPublica that it has received big donations from \u201cmost all\u201d of the area hotels and casinos \u2014 including MGM, Wynn, Boyd Gaming, Station Casinos and Caesars, among others \u2014 but it has never received donations from the Trump Hotel. \u201cNo, they have not been a donor,\u201d Scott told ProPublica.\n\nBut here\u2019s where the viral claim about Las Vegas hotel donations lacks truthfulness: Not all of the city\u2019s hotels have opened up rooms for first responders to quarantine themselves away from family or roommates, nor have they all donated food. An Extended Stay America, for example, is in that group.\n\nAccording to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, at least 148 hospitality businesses offer short-stay rooms downtown or near the strip in Las Vegas. Combined, hotels and motels citywide maintain 149,158 rooms.\n\nOf the total amount of hospitality properties in Las Vegas, 36 are opening rooms up to medical staff and first responders in light of COVID-19, a representative of the American Hotel & Lodging Association\u2019s Hospitality for Hope program told the Las Vegas Review-Journal for one story. Others could be making donations on their own, too.\n\nFor example, Diamond Resorts, which runs Polo Towers, Cancun Resort, and Desert Paradise Resort in Las Vegas, said it is offering free rooms for healthcare workers and first responders, donating food and supplies to local food pantries, and offering up parking lots for COVID-19 testing. \u201cWe are proud to support them the best way we know how \u2014 by saying thank you and providing them with a home away from home,\u201d Diamond Resorts CEO Mike Flaskey and staff wrote in a statement. Marriott has also committed $10 million in hotel stays for nurses and doctors nationwide, including in Las Vegas.\n\nNeither the Las Vegas Hospitality Association nor the Nevada Hotel and Lodging Association responded to Snopes\u2019 requests for comment.\n\nIn public briefings, U.S. President Donald Trump has applauded private companies across various sectors \u2014 including Ford, 3M, and General Electric \u2014 for their promises to ramp up the production of equipment to fight the virus. \u201cIt\u2019s been really amazing to see these big, strong, powerful \u2014 in some cases, very small companies, family-owned companies, step up and make a lot of great product for what we\u2019re going through and what we will continue to be going through for a while,\u201d he said in a late-March briefing.\n\nAnd on April 5, the White House praised the private hospitality industry, specifically, by tweeting a \u201cthank you\u201d to hotels nationwide that are providing rooms for healthcare workers and first responders.", "lang": "en"}
