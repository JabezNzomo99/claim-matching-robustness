No, that's completely not true. It was made up by a liberal satire website that tries to trick conservatives and Trump supporters into sharing over the top fake news so the fans of the site can then mock them. The quote is completely made up, as are the stories about Obama's daughters. None of it is real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by the website trumpbetrayed.us on August 27, 2018 titled \"Rosa Parks' Granddaughter: Obama Kids 'Set Blacks Back 100 Years' With Bad Behavior\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nOn Sunday, both of Barack Obama's kids got into some trouble. Malia Obama wrote a racist op-ed for the Harvard Sentinel in which she called John McCain a \"cracker,\" a vile insult toward white people that is every bit as bad as the \"n-word,\" and Sasha Obama was charged with 15 felonies after a drug incident in a Saks Fifth Avenue in Jacksonville, Florida. After all that, legendary civil rights leader Rosa Parks' granddaughter felt she had no choice but to speak out. \"The Obamas are disgracing our country,\" Muriel Parks-Gouldman told Fox News in an interview late Sunday night. \"The girls are out of control and their father drove our nation into the ground.\" Parks-Gouldman told Fox host Bret Baier that \"this latest drug incident and the racist attack on John McCain prove that Barack Obama is not just a bad President but a bad father.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail and might have suspected something was up:\n\nAs we noted about a year ago when we first debunked a hoax about \"Rosa Parks' granddaughter\", Rosa Parks never had any children so she definitely didn't have grandkids either:\n\nIt would be impossible for this fictional character to have really made these coments about Sasha and Malia Obama.\n\nThe site comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including potatriotpost.us, dailyworldupdate.us and nofakenewsonline.us. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nWe wrote about trumpbetrayed.us before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Sheriff Joe Arpaio Will NOT Take Over McCain's Seat In The Senate", "lang": "en"}
