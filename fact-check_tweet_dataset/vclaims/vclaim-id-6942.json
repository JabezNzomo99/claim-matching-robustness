As we\u2019ve reported, in the 1980s, the FBI established a definition for \u201cmass murder\u201d as \u201cfour or more victims slain, in one event, in one location.\u201d Shooters are not included in the victim count if they committed suicide or were killed in a justifiable homicide, according to a Congressional Research Service report. But \u201cmass murder\u201d is not the same as \u201cmass shooting.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s where the two start to differ. Lott tightens his definition, excluding shootings that resulted from gang or drug violence or during the commission of a crime. Everytown includes these incidents. Lott justifies this by citing a 2014 FBI study on active-shooter incidents. (Caveat: An active shooter may be but is not necessarily the same as a mass shooter. The FBI did not require fatalities when it evaluated \u201cactive shooter\u201d situations, and the report underlines this difference, noting, \u201cThis is not a study of mass killings or mass shootings, but rather a study of a specific type of shooting situation law enforcement and the public may face.\u201d)\n\nAnother major difference between Lott and Everytown is in where they argue a mass shooting can occur. Lott is very clear that he looks only at \u201cmass public shootings.\u201d Referring to the same FBI study, he writes, \u201cThe FBI also defines \u2018public\u2019 places as \u2018includ[ing] commercial areas (divided into malls, businesses open to pedestrian traffic, and businesses closed to pedestrian traffic), educational environments (divided into schools [pre-kindergarten through 12th grade] and IHEs), open spaces, government properties (divided into military and other government properties), houses of worship, and health care facilities.\u2019 \u201d\n\nLott did not mention that the list, defined as locations \u201cwhere the public was most at risk during an [active-shooter] incident,\u201d also included \u201cresidences,\u201d which accounted for 4.4 percent of such incidents. He explained these exclusions in a Fox News op-ed, arguing that \u201cmass public shootings are uniquely motivated,\u201d unlike a shooting that is the result of a gang fight or a drug sale. He added that \u201cshootings in private residences are distinctly different, since they often involve killers who know the homeowners and whether they own guns.\u201d\n\nLouis Klarevas, a University of Massachusetts professor and the author of \u201cRampage Nation: Securing America from Mass Shootings,\u201d dismissed Lott\u2019s reasoning, noting that plenty of mass shootings occurred in residential settings and querying why those victims should be overlooked. Everytown\u2019s director of research and implementation, Sarah Tofte, went further. \u201cThe claim that so-called \u2018gun-free zones\u2019 attract mass shooters doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny,\u201d she told us via email. \u201cIt\u2019s just not what the numbers show. We look closely at the data on mass shootings, and it shows that relatively few take place in areas where civilians are prohibited from carrying firearms. In fact, the vast majority of mass shootings take place in private homes and are often tied to domestic violence.\u201d The organization\u2019s data found that incidents that took place in private homes accounted for 63 percent of the total number of mass shootings they examined between 2009 and 2016.\n\nHere, Lott has a much wider definition. In an email, he wrote that gun-free zones are \u201cplaces where only police or military policy are classified, places where it is illegal to carry a permitted concealed handgun, places that are posted as not allowing a permitted concealed handgun, places where \u2018general citizens\u2019 are not allowed to obtain permits or where permits are either not issued to any general citizens or to only a very tiny selective segment.\u201d\n\nIn layman\u2019s terms, Lott\u2019s definition is so wide that the White House, where there are snipers on the roof, would be considered a gun-free zone. His data set classifies the shootings that took place at Fort Hood and the Washington Navy Yard as having occurred in gun-free zones. Klarevas disputed Lott\u2019s characterization \u2014 wondering how \u201ca place can be a gun free zone if guns are present?\u201d\n\nNo matter how we spin these numbers, one thing is clear \u2013 they can be spun. And they have been. Without a commonly accepted and uniform definition of \u201cmass shooting\u201d or agreement on what constitutes a \u201cgun-free zone,\u201d it\u2019s difficult to settle this debate. Advocates on both sides can point to holes and debatable logic in the reasoning of the study from the other sides.\n\nBut Lott\u2019s study is really not our focal point today. It\u2019s the president. As always, the burden for proving the accuracy of a claim is on the speaker. When the gap between dueling studies is so large, largely because the count depends on definitions, politicians need to be especially careful about citing one. Trump lunged for a dramatic statistic without including necessary context. He earns Two Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
