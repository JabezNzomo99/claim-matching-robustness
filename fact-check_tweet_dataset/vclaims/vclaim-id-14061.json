Kanhaiya Kumar has appealed to people to vote for alliance candidate Tanvir Hasan as his (Kanhaiya's) health condition deteriorates. Says, he has done this to stop the rise of communal forces. CPI is yet to come out on the issue.\"\n\nYou can view the viral post here and access its archived version here.\n\nBOOM tried reaching out to Kanhaiya. We were able to get in touch with one of his aide's who told us that the CPI leader was absolutely fine and was visiting booths on Monday.\n\n\"The news is absolutely fake and Kanhaiya is visiting the booths right now,\" he said.\n\nBOOM also ran a reverse image search on the viral image and found that the same picture was posted on a Kanhaiya Kumar fan page on Facebook on February 4, 2019.\n\nWhile the page is not verified, it does share minute-by-minute updates of Kanhaiya's campaign in Begusarai.\n\nThe caption with the picture reads, \"Unwell from several days. Will get well soon and fight for your rights. Jai Bhim! Lal Salam!!\n\nBOOM also checked the CPI leader's official Facebook page that has a picture of him after casting his vote. The picture posted at around 9.18 am shows him in good health.", "lang": "en"}
