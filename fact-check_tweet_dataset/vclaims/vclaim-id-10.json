Examples can be seen here and here.\n\nA reverse Google image search showed that this is actually a small sculpture of a platypus. The search brings up the Artstation page (see www.artstation.com/) of Serbian artist Vladimir Mati\u0107-Kuriljov who made this object out of Super Sculpey and painted it with acrylic paints, as referenced here .\n\nIn the description, Mati\u0107-Kuriljov adds, \u201cProbably the cutest thing I ever made.\u201d\n\nMati\u0107-Kuriljov\u2019s about page describes his work: \u201cGraduated from the Faculty of Applied Arts in Belgrade in 2010. specializing in illustration and animation. Since 2013. I\u2019ve been working at Mad Head Games. I also do illustration, portraits, caricature, comics, animation, scale modeling, FX makeup, cosplay, miniature sculpting and art dolls.\u201d\n\nReal baby platypuses or \"puggles\" look somewhat different to this sculpture, as shown here and here.\n\nA website called People of Lancaster even used the photograph to illustrate an article (see here) about a duck-billed platypus allegedly being born at a zoo. The article is tagged as \u201csatire\u201d at the end of the piece \u2013 but this is not clear to a new visitor to the site. They have also shared the article and picture on their Facebook page here , promoting over 4,000 shares. Some users evidently understood the article to be true, posting comments such as: \u201cyour kids would love to see this\u201d. Such was the reaction, ZooAmerica (the real Pennsylvania zoo named in the \u2018satirical\u2019 article) stated in a comment underneath:\n\n\u201cHello from ZooAmerica! We want our guests to know this is not a legitimate story. That said, we are excited to have recently welcomed some new additions to ZooAmerica, including a Canada lynx named Wren and a river otter named Iris. We also opened a new parrot habitat for our six thick-billed parrots last month.\u201d\n\nFalse: This is not a photograph of a baby platypus, and one was not recently born at ZooAmerica.", "lang": "en"}
