This is false. The 2019 budget plans for the transition of the Canadian Airport Security Authority (CATSA) from a government agency to an independent, not-for-profit entity, but security procedures will not be affected by the change, Transports Canada and the Canadian Airports Council told AFP.\n\n\u201cCompliments of the UNagenda & the Liberals, Canada will now be eliminating all Security Screening at airports so terrorists & traffickers will have no resistance entering our beautiful nation,\u201d claims a tweet published on March 21, 2019. Screenshots of the tweet were subsequently shared hundreds of times on Facebook.\n\nThe tweet quotes another tweet which links to reporting on the 2019 fiscal budget delivered on March 19 by Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau. The reporting correctly states that the new budget calls for the eventual elimination of CATSA, a publicly owned corporation in charge of airport security screenings in Canada which is accountable to the Canadian parliament via Transports Canada.\n\nIn an annex on page 300 of the recently released budget, the section shown below states, \u201cThe Government also proposes to provide funding for the Canadian Transportation Agency and Transport Canada in support of transitioning CATSA to an independent, not-for-profit entity.\u201d\n\nHowever, CATSA\u2019s replacement by a new entity will not affect the way security checks are conducted in Canada, nor will Canada stop screening air travelers or airport workers, according to Simon Rivet, senior advisor for Transports Canada.\n\n\u201cThere is no plan to eliminate security checks for passengers or for merchandise transported by plane,\u201d he told AFP by email in French. \u201cTransports Canada will continue to play an exclusive role in terms of regulation and surveillance relative to security checks in Canadian airports.\u201d\n\nRivet added that safety and security remain priorities for the Canadian government, and that under the new system, \u201cprocedures, criteria and training requirements\u201d for airport security workers will remain the same.\n\nFurther, Canada is a signatory of the 1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation . As such, Canada is bound to the Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs), general guidelines adopted under the Chicago Convention by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a United Nations agency in charge of codifying international air navigation practices.\n\nAnnex 17 of the ICAO\u2019s SARPs, pictured below, stipulates that countries must have measures to prevent weapons, explosives or other dangerous devices from getting on board of aircraft.\n\nNot enforcing these regulations by foregoing airport security checks would put Canada at odds with international norms and could affect which countries would accept outbound Canadian flights.\n\n\u201cCanada is still a member of ICAO and is still governed by the requirements to screen every passenger that passes through Canadian airports,\u201d Chris Phelan, vice president for aviation security and industry affairs of the Canadian Airport Council, a division of Airports Council International-North America, told AFP.", "lang": "en"}
