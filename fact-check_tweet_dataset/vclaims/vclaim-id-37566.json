We love you Mayor President Duterte, Happy New Year to everyone. God bless to our President, God bless Philippines\u201d.\n\nThe article says the photos show Duterte at his home celebrating his first Christmas as president. Duterte was sworn in as the nation\u2019s leader on June 30, 2016.\n\n\n\nThe post, when translated to English, says: \u201cHe is still simple up until now. He wears sandals, he even washes the dishes. This is what the elitists, the oligarchs and the paid media whose urine is yellow will never understand\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
