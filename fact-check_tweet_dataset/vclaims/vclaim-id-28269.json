The claim is misleading; there is no new law in Thailand that automatically jails anyone arrested for suspected drunk driving for one month; the Royal Thai Police said the posts were \u201cfake\u201d.\n\nThe claim was shared on the messaging app Line on December 11, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the message:\n\nThe Thai-language message translates to English as: \u201cToday is the first day of law enforcement for the punishment of drunk drivers. Fine 10,000 THB and one month in jail upon arrest, also no community service. This means if you are caught, you will be in jail right away. Please share it with other groups.\u201d\n\nMultiple Thai-language posts with a similar claim were also shared on Facebook here, on Twitter here and on Instagram here.\n\nThe misleading claim also appeared in this June 28, 2019 article, published by Real Time Car magazine, a Thai-language motoring site.\n\nThe article\u2019s Thai language headline translates to English as: \u201cDrink and drive, no court trial, jail immediately for 1 month and fine 10,000 THB\u201d.\n\nA similar misleading claim was also published in Facebook posts here and here, alongside graphics which contained a mixture of accurate and inaccurate information about Thailand\u2019s drunk driving laws.\n\nThe claims are all misleading.\n\nAccording to Thailand\u2019s Traffic Act B.E. 2522, Article 160, which can be seen here on the official website of the Office of the Council of State, motorists caught driving under the influence of alcohol face a jail term of up to one year, a fine of 5,000 to 20,000 THB, or both.\n\nThere were no new or amended laws on drunk driving passed this year -- Thailand's traffic laws were amended on May 19, 2019, and can be seen here but the provisions covering punishment for drunk driving were not changed.\n\nSpecial Branch Police Division 3 commander Pol Maj-General Ekarak Limsangkas told AFP by phone on December 11, 2019 that people who violated the traffic laws on drunk driving would be sent to court.\n\n\u201cUnder current laws motorists driving under the influence will undergo a court trial,\u201d he said.\n\n\"The maximum penalty for drunk driving is a one-year prison term and a fine ranging between 5,000-20,000 THB. Community service will also depend on the severity of the case and the offender\u2019s past charges.\u201d\n\nThe Police Magazine Thailand, an official Facebook account for the Royal Police Thailand\u2019s magazine, stated in this post on June 19, 2019, that the claims about the new traffic law in Thailand were not accurate.\n\nThe post\u2019s Thai language caption translates to English as: \u201c#FakeNews, the information here is not entirely correct.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
