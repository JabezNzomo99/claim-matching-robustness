He gets up and says that. And then he tells me that, oh, my language was a little bit rough.\"\n\nDid Bush really say such a thing, and did the press ignore it? Trump\u2019s recounting of the facts is pretty selective.\n\nTrump\u2019s spokeswoman referred us to a a Feb. 6 article by Matt Viser in the a few days before the New Hampshire primary. The main point of the article was that Bush had to do well in New Hampshire -- or later this month in South Carolina -- or he would face pressure to end his campaign.\n\n\"Sitting on his campaign bus \u2014 laptop, turkey jerky, and coffee all nearby \u2014 Jeb Bush was befuddled over his campaign\u2019s failure to capture more attention from the news media.\n\n\"I could drop my pants,\" he said in an interview. \"Moon the whole crowd. Everybody would be aghast, except the press guys would never notice.\"\n\nSo it was actually Bush who suggested -- in jest here -- to the Boston Globe reporter that he could even pull down his pants and moon people and he still would get no media attention.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say that Bush was exaggerating here to make a point about the lack of media coverage he was getting. And Bush made that point to a reporter from a major publication. And that reporter led with it in an article three days before the primary.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments made it sound like Bush was threatening to moon people, and that\u2019s not the case.\n\nBush\u2019s quote at the time was repeated on various blogs on the Internet, and The Drudge Report posted it on\n\nTrump said that Bush \"said he would take his pants off and moon everybody ... Nobody reports that.\"\n\nBush did talk about mooning people. The Boston Globe reported on Feb. 6 that Bush said, \"I could drop my pants. Moon the whole crowd. Everybody would be aghast, except the press guys would never notice.\"\n\nBush\u2019s comment to the reporter was intended to show how he felt he was getting no campaign coverage. But Trump\u2019s statement is misleading, because Bush wasn\u2019t threatening to moon people, and his comment was indeed reported.\n\nThe statement has an element of truth but ignores critical context. So we rate it Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
