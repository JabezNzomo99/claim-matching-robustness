Over the summer of 2016, he attracted attention for remarks he made in Moscow that were critical of U.S. policy from his trip. On Aug. 5, the Trump campaign said Page was an \u201cinformal foreign policy adviser\u201d who \u201cdoes not speak for Mr. Trump or the campaign.\u201d By Sept. 23, a campaign spokesperson denied he was ever part of the campaign. Three days later, Page announced he was taking a leave of absence from the campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to come back to the question I asked before with regards to your false statement that you submitted to Congress. On here it was very clear that it asked for contracts with foreign entities over the last two years. Have you had any foreign contract with foreign entities whether it\u2019s Novartis or the Korean airline or Kazakhstan BTA Bank? Your testimony earlier said that you had contracts with them. \u2026 Why didn\u2019t you put them on the form? It says it\u2019s a criminal offense to not put them on this form for the last two years. Why did you not do that?\u201d", "lang": "en"}
