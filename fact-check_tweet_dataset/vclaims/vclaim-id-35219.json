Talk to your local florist. Find out what flowers can you order that will help Australian farms rebuild and replenish\u201d.\n\n\u201cI promise your partner will still be a happy little vegemite because you took the time to organise flowers. And you\u2019ll sleep a little better knowing that you\u2019ve helped Australia.\u201d\n\nThe post has been shared more than 39,000 times and seen by more than 200,000 people.
