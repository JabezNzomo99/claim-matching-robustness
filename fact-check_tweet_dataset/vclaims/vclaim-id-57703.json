For having misleading fowards in the group. A case is being registered against every admin. U will get bail at police station but have to fight in criminal court with a jail term from 1 to 5 years...\"\n\nThe second half of the viral message claims the Ministry of Home Affairs announced sharing any posts related to Coronavirus on social media is a punishable offense. \n\n\n\nThis claim has already been debunked by BOOM. (See the link below)\n\n\n\nAlso Read: No, Home Ministry Has Not Made Sharing Coronavirus Messages A Punishable Offence\n\nBOOM received the forward on its WhatsApp helpline number (7700906111) from multiple readers asking us if the message was true.\n\n\n\nOn searching with the same misleading caption, we found that the post was being shared with the false claims made in the post.\n\nBOOM contacted Mumbai Police spokesperson, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Pranay Ashok who rubbished the claim that Mumbai police's cyber cell was registering cases against 52 WhatsApp group admins. \"This is untrue,\" DCP Ashok told BOOM.\n\nWe also contacted Dadar Police who also confirmed that 52 group admins were not called to the police station for questioning and the message doing the rounds was unfounded.\n\nThe second half of the viral message combines another hoax message, that claims posting anything related to Coronavirus on social media has been declared a punishable offence by the government. BOOM debunked that hoax forward on March 30, 2020. The forward falsely attributes the order to a nonexistent official named Ravi Nayak at the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)\n\nBOOM also found out that MHA's website also does not have any official by the name Ravi Nayak, nor does it include the designation of principal secretary, as claimed in the message. (See screenshots below)\n\n\n\nBOOM has previously fact-checked fake forwards circulating on social media relating to the Coronavirus outbreak.\n\nAlso Read: False: Army Called In To Control Seven Areas In Mumbai", "lang": "en"}
