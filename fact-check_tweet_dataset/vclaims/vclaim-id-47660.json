The timeline prompted some to ask whether Trump had really blamed Obama for leaving him faulty tests for a disease that did not yet exist.\n\nAfter COVID-19 was first detected in the U.S., something of a scandal broke out surrounding the failure to provide and coordinate widespread testing for the virus. This failure was the result of, as The New York Times reported, \u201ctechnical flaws, regulatory hurdles, business-as-usual bureaucracies and lack of leadership at multiple levels.\u201d Notably, diagnostic tests first sent out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were flawed.\n\nFast forward to the end of April. During a White House meeting between Trump and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, CNN Reporter Jim Acosta asked Trump, \u201cIs it fair for the voters to take into consideration your handling of the pandemic when they assess whether to reelect you in the fall?\u201d\n\nTrump responded to this question with a mixture of praise for the response of his own administration and blame for the previous administration for failures, something he has done before.\n\nAccording to a White House transcript of the exchange, here is what Trump stated in regards to faulty tests:\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And you have to understand: When we took over, the cupboards were bare. And the thing that \u2014 frankly, it\u2019s not as tough as the ventilator situation. We\u2019re the king of ventilators. But what we have done is \u2014 on testing, we\u2019re doing numbers the likes of which nobody has ever seen before. And I told you, the President of South Korea, President Moon, called me to congratulate me on testing. And we did more tests than any other country anywhere in the world. And I think they told me yesterday a number \u2014 if you add up the rest of the world, we\u2019ve done more testing. And it\u2019s a higher quality test. So I think we\u2019ve done a \u2014 I think the whole team, federal government \u2014 we built hospitals for you and others. THE PRESIDENT: We built medical centers. And I\u2019m talking about thousands and thousands of beds. Many, many medical centers. We had \u2014 as you know, we had the governor of Florida and the governor of Louisiana over the last two days. They could not have been \u2014 and one was a Democrat, and this gentleman happens to be a proud Democrat. They could not have been more supportive of the effort of the federal government. Jim ACOSTA: But aren\u2019t you seeing massive lines for food? THE PRESIDENT: Let me just tell you, we have \u2014 we started off with empty cupboards. The last administration left us nothing. We started off with bad, broken tests and obsolete tests. What we\u2019ve come up with, between the Abbott Laboratories, where you have the five-minute test. Did they test you today? GOVERNOR MURPHY: They did test me. THE PRESIDENT: Good. Now I feel better. (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT: You did the five-minute \u2014 the Abbott test.\n\nBecause Trump stated that the previous administration had \u201cleft us with nothing,\u201d then immediately stated his own administration \u201cstarted off with bad, broken tests and obsolete tests\u201d during a discussion of the Trump administration\u2019s handling of COVID-19, we rate the claim that Trump implied the Obama administration was to blame for leaving behind faulty COVID-19 tests as \u201cTrue.\u201d\n\nAs of this writing, the CDC tallies more than 1,031,659 COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and 60,057 deaths from the disease.", "lang": "en"}
