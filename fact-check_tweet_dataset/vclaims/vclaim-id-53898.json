Florida Department of Military Affairs and Georgia National Guard spokespeople said National Guard troops have not blocked access between the states.\n\nThe viral post claims, without offering a source or evidence, that the National Guard is blocking access from Florida to Georgia. It has been shared more than 5,800 times on Facebook at press time.\n\nIf the National Guard in either state had started restricting travel between Georgia and Florida, it would have been picked up by the media, yet no news outlets have reported it. Nor have the National Guard Bureau, Georgia National Guard or Florida National Guard issued press releases announcing the measure.\n\n\u201cI can confirm that the Florida National Guard has not set up border checkpoints or anything of the like,\u201d said William M.G. Manley, deputy communications director for the Florida Department of Military Affairs, in an email to the Daily Caller.\n\nGeorgia National Guard spokesman Lt. Colonel Patrick Watson also confirmed in a phone interview with the Caller that the post\u2019s claim is \u201cabsolutely not true.\u201d (RELATED: Did Nostradamus Predict The Coronavirus Outbreak?)\n\nMore than 1,100 Florida National Guard members have been activated to support the state\u2019s response to the new coronavirus, according to Manley. They are working with state health and emergency management staff at community-based COVID-19 testing sites and supporting airport screening operations, among other duties.\n\nOn March 14, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp called up to 2,000 members of the state\u2019s National Guard to \u201cassist with COVID-19 mitigation and critical services, including the transfer of Georgians currently at Dobbins Air Reserve Base to their homes,\u201d according to CBS 46.\n\nUPDATE: This article has been updated to reflect the correct spelling of Gov. Brian Kemp and Lt. Colonel Patrick Watson\u2019s names.", "lang": "en"}
