However, they do not necessarily mean that he or the government expects the current levels of infection to continue, or that they think this would be a good thing.\n\nHow many would die at the current rate?\n\nAnother member of Independent SAGE, Professor Christina Pagel, did the calculations which led to the 27,000 figure. She told Full Fact: \u201cThere were 171 deaths recorded on 23rd June and 123 per day on average over the previous week. The following week (24th June \u2013 1 July) it was 115 on average per day.\n\n\u201c27,000 comes from rounding down to 100 for 9 months per day as a simple calculation of what a continuation of the \u2018current situation\u2019 might mean.\u201d (These figures describe deaths involving Covid-19, not all excess deaths, as Sir David said, which is a different measure.)\n\nPeople who die from Covid-19 usually catch the disease some weeks before their death, so Professor Pagel also did another calculation to estimate the number of deaths that would result from the number of new infections that were happening on 23 June.\n\nTo do this, Professor Pagel found that the average number of confirmed cases fell by 40% between the beginning of June and the week before Prof Whitty\u2019s comments. She then applied this rate of reduction to the average number of deaths in the week before 23 June, on the assumption that if the number of new infections happening at the time was 40% lower then this would result in 40% fewer deaths.\n\nThis produced a death rate of 75 deaths per day, which over nine months produced a figure that Professor Pagel rounded down for a total of 20,000, which appeared in Independent SAGE\u2019s tweets, and on its website.\n\nWe understand that Professor Pagel\u2019s calculations were only intended as a rough estimate, but they give a final figure that seems to be too high.\n\nThis is partly because Professor Pagel\u2019s data shows Covid-19 deaths on the days they were reported, not the days that they happened. This gives a distorted picture of the epidemic\u2019s progress, because the reporting of a death is often delayed.\n\nCombined data now available from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), National Records of Scotland (NRS) and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) shows that in the week ending 1 July, an average of 70 people died per day, which is below the level on which Professor Pagel\u2019s estimates are based. (It is possible that this figure may be revised up, as deaths continue to be processed.)\n\nProfessor Pagel\u2019s totals also do not tally with the Independent SAGE\u2019s own estimates for new infections.\n\nIn his Sky News interview, Sir David said that if the number of new infections remained constant \u201cwe would still have about 2,000 to 3,000 new infections in England per day\u201d. He added that 27,000 \u201cis the number of deaths that would follow from that\u201d.\n\nProfessor Pagel gave an estimated range of between 2,300 and 4,300 new infections per day in the UK in a series of slides she prepared for Independent SAGE in late June.\n\nIt is generally estimated that 0.5%-1% of people infected with Covid-19 ultimately die from the disease. Applying this to Professor Pagel\u2019s numbers (which represent the whole UK), we would expect a maximum of about 11,610 deaths in nine months and a minimum of 3,105.\n\nIndependent SAGE\u2019s calculation of 27,000 deaths implies a death rate for Covid-19 of between 4.3% and 2.3%, which is far above the normal range of estimates.\n\nProfessor Pagel agrees that, \u201cif the current estimates by the ONS and Cambridge [Biostatistics Unit of] between 3,000 and 3,500 cases per day in the UK was to stay consistent in the next nine months the number of deaths would be lower.\u201d\n\nAny preventable death is a terrible event, and of course it remains possible that the levels of infection will rise again before next spring. But a realistic estimate of how many Covid-19 deaths the UK could expect at the current rate is a much lower than Sir David and Independent SAGE have claimed.\n\nWith thanks to Anthony Masters, Statistical Ambassador at the Royal Statistical Society, for his assistance.", "lang": "en"}
