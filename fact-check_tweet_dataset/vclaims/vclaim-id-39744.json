Clint Eastwood is alive.\n\nAs was reported by Snopes this specific instance of the claim started circulating in August of this year, despite the fact that Eastwood was alive and promoting a home development project in California. The video contained within the article was posted to YouTube on 28 September.\n\nThe video claims to be from CNN though there is no record of the story ever running on the CNN website.\n\nClint Eastwood has a film coming out this winter and reports of this do not mention his passing.\n\nThis isn't the first Clint Eastwood death hoax to appear on the internet. A previous version appeared in 2017.", "lang": "en"}
