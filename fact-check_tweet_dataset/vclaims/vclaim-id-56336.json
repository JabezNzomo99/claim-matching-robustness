Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that businesses should be kept closed until after the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn June 2020, social media users began circulating an image of a tweet supposedly posted by U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, in which she advocated that state governors keep businesses closed until after the 2020 presidential election so as to lessen the chances of President Donald Trump\u2019s being reelected. The tweet supposedly read as follows:\n\nIt\u2019s vital that Governors maintain restrictions on businesses until after the November Elections because economic recovery will help Trump be re-elected. A few business closures or job losses is a small price to pay to be free from his presidency. #KeepUsClosed\n\nAn image of that alleged tweet asserted that the tweet had been deleted after being shared over 20,000 times:\n\nThis tweet image was a fabrication, however, and not something posted by Ocasio-Cortez. It does not appear in her Twitter timeline, nor was it recorded by databases that capture and preserve deleted tweets.\n\nMoreover, although the tweet was supposedly \u201cshared over 20,000 times,\u201d we could find no instances whatsoever of the original tweet\u2019s having been shared or commented upon at all. It exists only as a screenshot of a faux tweet posted to a private Facebook group.", "lang": "en"}
