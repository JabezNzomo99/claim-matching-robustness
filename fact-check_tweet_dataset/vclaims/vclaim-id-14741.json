Hundreds of houses are being demolished for the purpose, for which the government is reportedly providing compensation.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of at least 40 ancient temples rediscovered in the clearance, a video floating across social media channels is being shared with the claim that it depicts the demolition of 80 Muslim houses for the construction of the corridor. \u201c45 old temples were discovered inside these houses,\u201d asserts the narrative.\n\nSeveral Tamil speakers have shared the video.\n\nThe claim was also circulating earlier in January. But in Hindi.\n\nThe claim which is also viral on WhatsApp says, \u201cModi ji have started buying 80 Muslim households. When these houses were demolished, 45 ancient temples were found. The fact is when Aurangzeb converted the original Kashi Vishwanath temple into the Gyanvapi mosque, he allocated plots of lands to his soldiers who occupied temples and built their homes on these temples.\u201d\n\nThe identical claim has been floating on social media since 2019.\n\nThe Kashi Vishwanath Corridor Project is under the supervision of the Kashi Vishwanath Special Area Development Board. The corresponding website of the Board contains a list of the properties purchased for the purpose of demolition. All the people named are Hindus.\n\nThe list includes 165 names. However, Vishal Singh, CEO, Kashi Vishwanath Special Area Development Board, told Alt News that till now 250 houses have been demolished for the project. When asked if any of the razed homes belonged to members of the Muslim community, Singh said, \u201cNot even a single house demolished was occupied by Muslims as the area is predominately Hindu.\u201d\n\nThe Board\u2019s website contains another list \u2013 an index of all the shopkeepers who have been compensated.\n\n\u201cAs part of the project\u201d, Singh informed, \u201ctwo separate compensations have been provided. First, to the owners of the houses/shops purchased for demolition, and second, to the shopkeepers who did not own the shops but have been working at the shops for years. The second form of compensation isn\u2019t a payment for demolition but for loss of livelihood.\u201d\n\nOut of the 89 shopkeepers who found a mention in the list, one of them was a Muslim woman named Yasmeen Bano. \u201cSeveral Muslim shopkeepers who had been working at the shops for a long period of time have been compensated,\u201d said Singh. They were, however, not owners of the shops but tenants.\n\nThe Kashi Vishwanath Corridor Project announced in March 2018 isn\u2019t merely an initiative aimed at providing pilgrims clean and uncongested roads from the temple to the ghats. It is a full-fledged transformation project that intends to remodel the ancient city. Starting with clearing the houses and shops on the pathway of the 50-feet-wide corridor, the ambitious project envisions an upgrade of the ghats of Ganga, waiting rooms for pilgrims, museums and auditoriums, lodging for priests and pilgrims, and a food street, among other development initiatives.\n\nA ground report by the BBC\u2018s Samiratmaj Mishra said that numerous residents are unhappy with the project. Sceptical about parting with their homes despite the compensation, several locals have been protesting since the past three months. Many of their houses adorn posters which say \u2013 \u2018Our homes are not for sale\u2019, \u2018We will not let our heritage get ruined.\u2019\n\nMishra informed Alt News that the video doing rounds on social media depicts the site of demolition. However, he too stated that the houses razed did not belong to members of the Muslim community.\n\nWe spoke to a local resident, Anurag Tiwari, for further corroboration. \u201cThe demolition sites did not have Muslim settlements but the houses and shops of Hindus residents. Most of these houses were built around temples, some big and some small. The government has compensated for the acquired properties and claims suggesting that Muslim homes were demolished seem communally motivated.\u201d said Tiwari.\n\nThe claim circulated on social media stands unsupported by facts. The localities being cleared for constructing the corridor are Hindu-dominated and none of the houses demolished to date belonged to members of the Muslim community. As corroborated by three independent sources, the temples rediscovered in the clearance were excavated from Hindu homes and not Muslim households.", "lang": "en"}
