Yes, that's true, but a viral image of paint on the rear side of the Vaughan memorial is from a 2018 incident blamed on a football fan after his team won the SuperBowl. A second photo showing \"FTP\" painted on the music icon's chest was apparently the result of a May 2020 attack.\n\nThe claim appeared in a post (archived here) where it was published by a Facebook user on June 23, 2020. It opened:\n\nOk so I'm completely confused now. \n\n Am I a Racist because I like Blues Music ? \n\n I'd really appreciate it if someone from BLM could explain the New Rules to me. Why would protestors deface a statue of Stevie Ray Vaughn? He is a Musician that plays the Blues and his music was influenced by Black Musicians.\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nThis Facebook post insinuates that the statue was recently defaced as Black Lives Matter protests swept the U.S. The graffiti on the front of the statue reads \"FTP,\" an abbreviation for the phrase \"F*** the police.\" That tagging apparently was done on May 30, 2020, but there is no proven connection to protesters. The second image showing graffiti on Vaughan's back is from February of 2018, however.\n\nThe January 2018 attack was allegedly carried out by a rabid Philadelphia Eagles fan after the teams SuperBowl victory.\n\nAlthough Stevie Ray Vaughan died in a helicopter crash at 35, he is still one of the most celebrated blues musicians today. During his career, he was the guitarist for the blues rock band, Double Trouble.\n\nSome of the posts about Vaughan also included the claim that the Jimi Hendrix statue in Seattle was vandalized in 2020. It was not. See Lead Stories' debunk titled Fact Check: Jimi Hendrix Statue In Seattle Was NOT Vandalized In 2020", "lang": "en"}
