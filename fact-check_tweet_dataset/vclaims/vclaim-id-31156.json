(This image was shot when Nehru visited the US in 1954. There was neither any PR agency working for him, any branding in place nor was there any social media campaigning. But Modi and his blind followers will tell you that no on former Prime Minister has ever stepped out of the country before 2014.)\u201d\n\nSeveral social media users \u2018fact-checked\u2019 this photograph and claimed that it was shot when former PM Nehru had visited USSR in 1956. The tweet below was posted by @IndiaHistorypic and was liked more than 10,000 times at the time of writing this article.\n\nSocial media influencer Prashant Patel Umrao also claimed that the image was shot in Moscow in 1956.\n\nOpIndiapublished an article on Tharoor\u2019s tweet and also claimed that the photo was taken in Moscow in 1956.\n\nA simple reverse-image search on Yandex throws up multiple Russian websites which say that this photograph was shot when Nehru had visited Magnitogorsk in 1955. \u201cIn August 1955, Jawaharlal Nehru came to Magnitogorsk with his daughter Indira Gandhi. The car \u2013 an open \u201cVictory\u201d \u2013 was \u201ccut off\u201d by the people from the motorcade,\u201d reads an article in MagMettal.\n\nMagMettal had uploaded another photo of the event.\n\nA keyword search of \u2018Jawaharlal Magnitogorsk\u2019 in Russian (\u0414\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0445\u0430\u0440\u043b\u0430\u043b \u041c\u0430\u0433\u043d\u0438\u0442\u043a\u0443),threw up Russian news reports that carried more images from the day. A reverse-search image led us to a similar photo (as the second image uploaded by MagMettal) shared byfotosoyuz74, the Chelyabinsk regional branch of the all-Russian public organization \u201cUnion of Photographers of Russia\u201d. This was earlier fact-checked by Boomlive.\n\nRussian newspaper Magnitogorsk Workerhad uploaded a newspaper archive of Nehru\u2019s visit to the city. According to the media outlet, Nehru had visited Magnitogorsk on June 17, 1955 and not in August as claimed by MagMettal. The former Indian Prime Minister\u2019s visit was reported by the newspaper on June 18, 1955.\n\nA report in The Hindu confirms that the former Indian Prime Minister had visited USSR in June 1955. His trip lasted for a little over two weeks \u2013 from June 7 to 23. \u201cHe came there after Stalin died in 1953 and, on the back of the Sino-Indian agreement on Tibet of 1954,\u201d the media outlet quoted Srinath Raghavan, author and military scholar.\n\nIt is noteworthy that among other states and cities covered during his trip, Nehru had also visited Moscow but the viral image pertains to when the former PM was in Magnitogorsk in June 1955. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor tweeted a half-hearted clarification after several people pointed that the image was shot in USSR and not the US.", "lang": "en"}
