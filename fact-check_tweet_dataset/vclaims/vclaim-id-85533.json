The CBO\u2019s refusal to credit much budget savings to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 1993 health-care plan is one of the factors that killed her effort during the Bill Clinton administration. But the rhetoric attacking it this time around certainly seems sharper. All eight previous CBO directors issued a joint letter last week to congressional leadership \u201cto express our strong objection to recent attacks on the integrity and professionalism of the agency and on the agency\u2019s role in the legislative process.\u201d\n\nThe key focus of the CBO\u2019s estimates in 2010 (which had to be revised in 2012 after the Supreme Court ruled that states could not be forced to expand Medicaid) was to estimate how many people would gain insurance under the law. On that score, CBO basically aced it, doing much better than other forecasters at the time, according to a 2015 analysis of various projections by the Commonwealth Fund.\n\nThe projections for the subcategories are always going to be prone to more error than overall estimates. The margin of error in polls, for instance, increases as you dig deeper into certain voting groups. But what matters most is if the poll predicts the actual margin of victory.\n\nSo, although the video claims that the CBO inaccurately measures health coverage, the CBO just about nailed the most important figure from a budget perspective. That\u2019s relevant because, in the video, the White House is trying to undermine an equivalent figure in the CBO\u2019s estimate of Senate GOP plans \u2014 that 22 million fewer people than under the current law would have health insurance a decade from now.\n\nIn the second section of the video, the White House mentions that 22 million figure and says it\u2019s wrong because the CBO \u201cfalsely assumes\u201d that 18 million people would be on the Obamacare exchanges in 2018. The video says that this is because of \u201cfaulty baseline estimates\u201d since only about 10 million are in the exchanges as of 2017. The video suggests that, thus, the effect of the GOP proposals is overstated.\n\nIt\u2019s correct that the CBO baseline indicates 18 million people would be on the exchanges in 2018 \u2014 but that\u2019s because Republican leaders in Congress told the CBO to use this particular baseline. It\u2019s a baseline from March 2016, not the more recent January 2017 baseline, which scaled back the figure and estimates that 11 million people would participate in the exchanges in 2018. So the White House is trying to fault the CBO for a decision made by its congressional allies.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened: The GOP-led Congress in January was in such a rush to repeal Obamacare that it moved forward before the CBO could complete an updated baseline, as it does regularly during the year. So budget instructions for the year were based on the March 2016 baseline, and the CBO was ordered to do its analysis of health-care proposals based on the old baseline.\n\nSince then, the CBO has released an updated baseline in January and another in June. Even so, the CBO is still being told by GOP congressional leaders to calculate off the old March 2016 dateline. Close readers of the CBO estimates would note that the agency is upfront about this problem, highlighting in its estimates that it is using the March 2016 baseline.\n\nThe problem for Republicans in Congress is that switching to a more recent baseline might actually not change the bottom-line effect on the number of uninsured \u2014 while it could reduce the projected budget savings that lawmakers are counting on to use a parliamentary procedure that thwarts a Senate filibuster requiring 60 votes. (Fewer people in the exchanges could mean the savings from repealing much of the law are lower.) The whole reason for using this procedure, known as reconciliation, is to avoid having to negotiate with Democrats on the legislation. So switching to a more accurate baseline might make passage in the Senate even more difficult.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s rather hypocritical for the White House to blame the CBO for using a baseline mandated by Republicans as part of an effort to cut Democrats out of the process. If given a choice, the CBO presumably would prefer to offer calculations based on the most recent baseline, as then estimates of the potential effect on the budget would be more accurate.\n\nThe CBO got the overall impact of the ACA on the number of uninsured largely correct, giving credibility to its estimates on the effects of the GOP proposals. Moreover, even the CBO concedes that the baseline it is using is not ideal, but it has to use this baseline because of orders by Republicans in Congress. So if the White House has a complaint, it should contact its allies in Congress, not blame the CBO.", "lang": "en"}
