Can you see the rings going around the 5G tower? That is the radiation that it will give off.\u201d\n\nHe then points to a purple circular symbol and says \u201clo and behold, above it, is the sign for coronavirus. Can you see it? Right in front of everybody\u2019s face.\u201d To emphasise the point, the post\u2019s message reads, \u201cSecrets hidden in plain sight\u201d.\n\nThe post by a New Zealand Facebook user has been viewed more than 20,000 times and attracted more than 130 shares.\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to produce a wellspring of conspiracy theories about its origins, effects and supposed relation to other global issues including 5G telecommunications.\n\nThe Facebook post focuses on Britain\u2019s new banknotes and the purported \u201csecrets\u201d of the redesigned \u00a320 note which entered circulation in February 2020. The note features an image of celebrated British painter J.M.W. Turner and includes a number of references connected to Turner and his art.\n\nThe video\u2019s claim of a \u201c5G tower\u201d and its \u201cradiation\u201d are in fact a \u201clarge see-through window with a blue and gold foil on the front depicting Margate lighthouse and Turner Contemporary (gallery)\u201c, according to the Bank of England.\n\nIn a press release, Turner Contemporary gallery director Victoria Pomery says the painter was a \u201cregular visitor to Margate in his lifetime.\u201d He also produced a number of paintings of the town in southeast England, often including the lighthouse.\n\nThe video\u2019s second claim is the banknote features the \u201csign for coronavirus\u201d, a purple circular symbol featuring the letter \u2018T\u2019. According to the Bank of England, the symbol represents the staircase at London\u2019s Tate Britain art gallery by architectural firm Caruso St John.\n\nWhat the video claims are a \u201c5G tower\u201d and \u201ccoronavirus symbol\u201d are in fact some of the \u00a320 note\u2019s security measures, introduced to protect against counterfeiting, the Bank of England says.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claims in the Facebook post to be false. The purported \u201c5G tower\u201d and its \u201cradiation\u201d on the \u00a320 banknote are in fact the Margate Lighthouse and Turner Contemporary art gallery, depicted in the note\u2019s clear window with a blue and gold foil overlay. The \u201csign for coronavirus\u201d, a purple circular symbol, represents the staircase at London\u2019s Tate Britain gallery, the Bank of England says. Both are security features to protect against counterfeiting.
