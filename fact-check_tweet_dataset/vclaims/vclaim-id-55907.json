The placards read, \u201cIndian Army Down..Down, We Support To China..Zindabad.\u201d The images are being shared in the backdrop of the ongoing border dispute with China where 20 Indian army soldiers were killed. Social media claims attempt to show that the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is offering support to Communist-ruled China.\n\nThe message shared along with the images reads, \u201c\u091a\u0940\u0928 \u0914\u0930 \u0909\u0938\u0915\u0940 \u0915\u092e\u094d\u092f\u0941\u0928\u093f\u0938\u094d\u091f \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u091f\u0940 \u0907\u0928 \u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0915\u094d\u0938\u0935\u093e\u0926\u0940 \u0915\u092e\u094d\u092f\u0941\u0928\u093f\u0938\u094d\u091f \u0928\u0947\u0924\u093e\u0913\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u0939\u0930 \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937 \u0932\u093e\u0916\u094b\u0902 \u0921\u0949\u0932\u0930 \u0926\u0947\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u0907\u0938\u0932\u093f\u090f \u092c\u0947\u0936\u0930\u094d\u092e , \u092c\u0947\u0939\u092f\u093e , \u0917\u0926\u094d\u0926\u093e\u0930 \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0915\u0940 \u091c\u0928\u0924\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u092e\u0928\u0947 \u0916\u0941\u0932\u0947\u0906\u092e \u092f\u0947 \u0938\u092c \u0915\u0930 \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902\u0964 \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0930\u0939\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948 \u0914\u0930 \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u0938\u0947 \u0939\u0940 \u0917\u0926\u094d\u0926\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0938\u0940\u0924\u093e \u0930\u093e\u092e \u092f\u0947\u091a\u0941\u0930\u0940 , \u0935\u0943\u0902\u0926\u093e \u0915\u0930\u093e\u0924,, \u0926\u094b\u0928\u094b\u0902 \u0935\u093e\u092e\u092a\u0902\u0925\u0940 \u0928\u0947\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0915\u094d\u0938\u0935\u093e\u0926\u0940 \u0915\u092e\u094d\u092f\u0941\u0928\u093f\u0938\u094d\u091f \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u091f\u0940 \u0915\u0947\u0964 \u091c\u093f\u0938\u0928\u0947 1962 \u0915\u0947 \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u2013 \u091a\u0940\u0928 \u092f\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092d\u0940 \u091a\u0940\u0928 \u0915\u093e \u0938\u092e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0928 \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0925\u093e\u0964\u201d\n\nSeveral Twitter users have also shared the images.\n\nAlt News has also received fact-check requests on its official mobile application.\n\nA reverse-image search led us to a June 16, 2020, tweet by CPI(M) where the same images were posted. The photos were shot during a protest against the policies of the PM Modi government.\n\nSitaram Yechury\u2019s placard reads, \u201cIMMEDIATELY PAY RS.7500 PER MONTH FOR THREE MONTHS TO ALL OUTSIDE INCOME TAX BRACKET.\u201d While Brinda Karat is holding a placard that reads, \u201cPROVIDE FREE 10 KG FOODGRAINS PER MONTHS FOR SIX MONTHS TO ALL NEEDY INDIVIDUALS.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Hindu, \u201cThe CPI(M) held nationwide protests demanding direct cash transfer to all families that do not come under the income tax net. It charges that the Narendra Modi government had failed to protect the livelihoods of millions of people during the [coronavirus] pandemic.\u201d\n\nIn an all-party meet, CPI(M) had expressed condolences at the death of Indian army soldiers in Galwan valley.\n\nTherefore, images of CPI(M) leaders Sitaram Yechury and Brinda Karat holding placards in protest against the policies of the Modi government were photoshopped to falsely project them holding placards with anti-army slogans.", "lang": "en"}
