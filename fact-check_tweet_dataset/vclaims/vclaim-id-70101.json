Its caption said, \u201cSattelite image view of The Philippines lit up at night showing a massive growth all over the country in just a span of 4 years.\u201d\n\nThe post was spotted by a member of the Rappler team. Many of the comments in the post credited President Rodrigo Duterte for the supposed development. As of writing, it had 372 shares, 301 reactions, and 46 comments.\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s (NASA) Black Marble project, where the 2016 image in Philippine Skyline\u2019s post was taken from, has not yet produced composite satellite images for the year 2020.\n\nIn a response to Rappler\u2019s email about the authenticity of the 2020 satellite imagery, NASA scientific programmer and analyst Ranjay Shrestha said, \u201cThe attached image appears to be post-processed using some image enhancing techniques (including image scaling) so we can\u2019t vouch for the validity and accuracy of the image.\u201d\n\nShrestha explained that the composite Black Marble data was produced for 2012 and 2016 only. The Black Marble team also recently released adjusted nighttime lights on August 26, but these were only until 2015. Shrestha said they will continue processing data until it reaches the year 2020.\n\nHe also said that there is a way to view real-time visualization of night lights, but that the output is unlike the one released by Black Marble.\n\n\u201cNASA worldview archives Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) global nighttime light images that could be potentially used for real-time nightlight visualization. Please note that these are raw top of atmosphere images with various contaminations (cloud, aerosols, moonlight, etc) and not ideal for quantitative analysis,\u201d Shrestha said. This can be viewed in NASA\u2019s interactive interface.\n\nRappler also reached out to Philippines Skyline to ask for the source or the tool used in creating the satellite image but we received no response. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
