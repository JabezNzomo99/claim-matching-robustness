Martin O\u2019Malley was in Austin on a campaign stop, he said immigration reform would pay off for all Americans through their paychecks.\n\nIn a Nov. 12, 2015 on \"Overheard with Evan Smith,\" O\u2019Malley discussed President Barack Obama\u2019s executive order on immigration, and whether he would take similar action. O\u2019Malley told Smith he believes the country needs immigration reform because it\u2019s \"something important for the economy of the United States.\"\n\n\"If we pass immigration reform, it will make wages go up on average $250 for the average household,\" he elaborated. \"Why? Because you\u2019re getting 11 million people in many times off-the-books jobs onto the open economy of the United States of America.\"\n\nThe number of undocumented immigrants in the United States has around 11 million since 2009, according to a July 2015 report from the Pew Research Center, evaluating data through 2014. Undocumented immigrants 5.1 percent of the U.S. labor force, Pew reported in July 2015.\n\nWe don\u2019t and can\u2019t check predictions. Still, we wondered whether it was true, based on research, that immigration reform could mean $250 more for the average American household, as O\u2019Malley said.\n\nO\u2019Malley\u2019s campaign press secretary, Haley Morris, said the governor got the $250 figure from a July 2013 White House , published in support of a 2013 Senate immigration reform bill. That report, \"The Economic Benefits of Fixing Our Broken Immigration System,\" states that \"in the long run, the Senate bill raises wages for all groups of workers by boosting productivity.\" The White House\u2019s conclusion relies on the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u2019s of the economic impact of that bill, the .\n\nThe $250 figure O\u2019Malley cites is certainly long term. It refers to a rise in wages between 2013 and 2033 \u2013 and doesn\u2019t otherwise estimate year-by-year changes.\n\nAs the White House report breaks it down: \"CBO estimates that real wages will be 0.5 percent higher in 2033 than projected under current law. In today\u2019s terms, that would be equivalent to an additional $250 of income for the median American household.\"\n\nWages would increase partly because immigration reform would lead to a higher rate of return on capital throughout the next two decades.\n\nA web search led us to George Borjas, a labor economist specializing in immigration issues at Harvard\u2019s John F. Kennedy School of Government. He questioned the assumptions behind the CBO\u2019s calculation.\n\nTo reach its conclusion about immigration reform\u2019s effect on wages, the CBO report uses a \"positivity effect,\" a name for the effect of a correlation between state GDP and immigration. However, Borjas , the relationship between higher state GDP and immigration could be correlation, not causation, which would put the $250 figure into question. Borjas, who reviewed the report at our request, said: \"Maybe immigrants are smart enough to realize they should settle in states with high productivity.\"\n\nOther research released when the bill in question was in the Senate in 2013 supported the CBO\u2019s analysis. An August 2013 from the Brookings Institution compared the bill\u2019s potential effects to immigration\u2019s historical impact on the economy, finding that \"on average, previous waves of immigrants tended to boost American wages.\"\n\nOn the other hand, neither analysis said American households would see an immediate or steady spike in income.\n\nEven if the long-term $250 figure holds true, the CBO concluded that comprehensive immigration reform actually would lead to lower average wages in the short-term before boosting overall productivity. In the first decade, according to its analysis, average wages would decrease by 0.1 percent. By the CBO's estimates, average wages would be slightly lower than under current law through 2024 before they rise above current wages the following decade.\n\nComprehensive immigration reform also would lead to a temporary imbalance in the labor market, causing slightly higher unemployment through 2020, when the labor market would adjust.\n\nWages would be lower at first, the CBO says, because growth of the workforce would outpace capital available. In addition, new workers would be less skilled and have lower wages, affecting average wages for the entire workforce.\n\nBrookings pointed out that wage decreases would be larger for workers with some high school or only a high school diploma, who would be more likely to compete with new workers, compared to college graduates.\n\nImmigration reform\u2019s effects on the economy extend beyond immediate and long-term effects on average wages. As Gregory Wright, an assistant professor of economics at University of California-Merced who studies international trade and migration, points out, \"Immigrants are very entrepreneurial relative to the native population, and high-skill immigrants tend to generate a disproportionate number of patents and are more innovative by other measures.\" In another section of its report, the CBO specifies that immigrants receive patents at twice the rate of the native-born U.S. population.\n\nAdditionally, Wright , immigration reform would create work through \"demand-side channels.\" \"Moving undocumented workers into the open would allow them to raise their own standard of living and they would subsequently demand more housing, education and generally more of all goods and services, which generates work for others,\" Wright said.\n\nIncreasing the sheer number of people in the workforce raises output and consumption, or GDP, Wright says. The CBO estimated that immigration reform would raise real GDP by 3.3 percent in 2023 and by 5.4 percent in 2033.\n\nImmigrants entering the official workforce will then pay taxes, supporting the aging U.S. population, Wright added.\n\nO\u2019Malley\u2019s claim that immigration reform would \"make wages go up on average $250 for the average household\" would not be accurate anytime soon. The $250 in question is a calculation based on mathematical assumptions -- assumptions that some question -- that refers to a long-term result over two decades. In the near term, the same analysis projects wages would dip slightly.\n\nO\u2019Malley\u2019s statement contains an element of truth, but the wage-raising conclusion is misleading. We rate it Mostly False.\n\nMOSTLY FALSE \u2013 The statement contains some element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\n\nClick here for on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
