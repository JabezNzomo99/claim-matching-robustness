Rajan in a Linkedin post dismissed the quotes saying, \"I have not participated in any such webinar.\"\n\nWe searched with the keywords from the viral message and found that the webinar and the key points were also being attributed to Darshan Mehta, CEO of Reliance Brands Limited. \n\n\n\nBOOM contacted Darshan Mehta, who confirmed that he had addressed a webinar in the first week of April 2020 organised by Jain International Trade Organization (JITO). \"I had addressed a webinar by JITO two Sundays back, but there was no recording or transcription of the webinar. Someone seems to have written down some points and made it viral.\"\n\nMehta confirmed to BOOM the first part of the viral post. However, he did not confirm all the points made in the long viral message. BOOM could not independently verify if all the points were made by Mehta during his webinar\n\nAdditionally, we did not find any update on the IMF website regarding a webinar chaired by Rajan. BOOM had also reached out to Rajan and IMF via email for a response before the former governor issued a clarification.\n\nThe post is viral in the backdrop of the lockdown imposed to tackle the Coronavirus outbreak and the potential impact of it on the economy.
