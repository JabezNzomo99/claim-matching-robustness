In his 1859 book \u201cOn the Origin of Species,\u201d he presented and explained the process of natural selection, whereby organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and reproduce.\n\nHowever, nowhere in that book, or in any of Darwin\u2019s writings, is the expression to be found. A search of Darwin Online, a database of his collected works, returned no matches. The University of Cambridge\u2019s Darwin Correspondence Project lists a version of this quote on its list of \u201cSix things Darwin never said.\u201d (RELATED: Did Charles Darwin Say, \u2018It Is Not The Strongest Or The Most Intelligent Who Will Survive\u2019?)\n\n\u201cI am very familiar with this purported quotation. It is of course not by Darwin,\u201d National University of Singapore science historian Dr. John van Wyhe told The Daily Caller in an email. \u201cIt is probably a mid-20th century attempt to summarize Darwin\u2019s theory that has been misattributed to Darwin.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the earliest appearance of the statement was found in a 1962 history textbook called \u201cCivilization Past and Present,\u201d according to the website Quote Investigator, though it may have appeared in earlier editions. The expression is part of a summary of Darwin\u2019s evolutionary theory by the textbook authors, but is not a direct quote from him or his writings.", "lang": "en"}
