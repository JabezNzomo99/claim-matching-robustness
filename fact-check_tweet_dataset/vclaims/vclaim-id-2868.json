Last July, the area was declared a deconfliction zone, under an agreement between the U.S. and Russia.\n\nThe Rukban refugee camp to which the Russian Defense Ministry refers, also known as the Berm, is located about six miles from Al-Tanf.\n\nPolygraph.info obtained from a trusted source a detailed \u201cInter-agency Operational Plan for delivery of a humanitarian aid to Rukban camp,\u201d which was developed earlier this month by the United Nations, Red Cross, World Health Organization and other actors.\n\nAccording to the document, the Rukban crisis did not start after the U.S.-led coalition established a military base, but has been ongoing since the spontaneous formation of the camp in 2014, after Jordan enforced \u201cstricter admission management into its territory.\u201d\n\nThe Jordanian authorities closed their border in June 2016 after an Islamic State suicide attack that killed and injured several Jordanian border guards.\n\nLarge numbers of refugees who were hoping to cross into Jordan instead ended up in the Rukban camp. The document states that, as of October 2017, \u201cbetween 30,000 and 55,000 people --70 to 80 per cent of whom are estimated to be women and children - are living in the camp under very difficult conditions and without access to basic services.\u201d\n\nAccording to the document, the delivery of humanitarian aid to a distribution warehouse near the Rukban camp \u201crequires a safe passage guarantee by the governments of Syria, the Russian Federation, the United States and Jordan.\u201d\n\n\u00adThis contradicts Russia\u2019s claims that the U.S. is solely responsible for the crisis, and shows that the cooperation of all parties is necessary for the aid plan to work.\n\n\u201cRussian and pro-regime media are spreading disinformation in order make their siege of the camp look like a U.S. effort to block aid deliveries to the camp,\u201d says Matti Suomenaro, a Syria researcher fo the Institute for the Study of War in Washington, DC, who says the main U.S. partner in the areas is Maghawir al Thowra (MaT), which is \u201cactively trying to protect aid deliveries\u201d to Rukban and has fighters stationed inside the camp to face off the Islamic State.\n\nThe press desk of the Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF)-Operation Inherent Resolve, which is the joint task force established by the U.S.-led international coalition against the Islamic State, told Polygraph.info via email: \u201cThroughout the conflict in Syria, the Coalition has provided extensive operational support to U.N. agencies operating in Rukban. The Coalition has repeatedly advised the Russians over the past several months that the Coalition is prepared and poised to help facilitate the movement of humanitarian aid to Rukban, but the Syrian regime has consistently, intentionally prevented those efforts.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s accusations regarding Rukban camp are \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201ccompletely false,\u201d the CJTF-Operation Inherent Resolve press desk said, adding that \u201cthe Coalition is comprised of 70 nations and four non-state organizations, with no one country in charge.\u201d\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry\u2019s claims \u201care factually incorrect,\u201d said Martin Reardon, vice president of the Soufan Group, a think tank specializing in terrorism analysis, in an email from Doha.\n\n\u201cThe deconfliction zone around al-Tanf was established by the U.S. last summer, with Russian concurrence, as a limiting measure to reduce the likelihood of direct contact between U.S. and Syrian regime/Iranian forces,\u201d Reardon noted.\n\nThe deconfliction zone \u201chas not been a hindrance to humanitarian relief efforts,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Reardon, \u201cTo suggest that loyalist forces (forces loyal to Syrian president Bashar Assad) are making any attempt at providing humanitarian relief there is unfounded.\u201d\n\nBoth the Central Command press office and Martin Reardon called Russia\u2019s allegations \u201cstate-generated propaganda aimed at undermining the U.S.\u201d\n\n\u201cRussia and its ground partners want to retake this territory so it makes sense that they would try to make these claims to undermine the U.S. presence,\u201d says Suomenaro. \u201cAl Tanf is the only non-regime controlled section of the Syrian-Iraqi-Jordanian border south of the Euphrates River.\u201d\n\nAn analysis of Russian media suggests Reardon\u2019s assessment is correct.\n\nAs shown on this screenshot from the Russian Internet search engine Yandex.ru, a search for \u201cAmerican base in Al Tanf\u201d yielded 31 million results during a seven-month period, which is a strong indication of an organized media campaign. The headlines vary from \u201cThe Americans use civilian refugees as a shield,\u201d to \u201cAmerican base in Al Tanf is a territory of controlled terrorism,\u201d to \u201cU.S. base in Al Tanf is a symbol of the collapse of the American lies about fighting terrorism in Syria.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe recommend that the Russian Defense Ministry focuses less energy on disseminating propaganda, and more effort on convincing the Syrian regime to allow delivery of much-needed supplies to Rukban,\u201d the CJTF-Operation Inherent Resolve Press Desk said.", "lang": "en"}
