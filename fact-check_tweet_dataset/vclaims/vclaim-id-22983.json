Let\u2019s try to analyze the claims made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: The couple seen along with BJP veteran Murali Manohar Joshi is his daughter and his son-in-law Shahnawaz Hussain. Fact: The woman seen with MM Joshi is BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain\u2019s wife Renu Sharma. But, she is not the daughter of Murali Manohar Joshi. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nThe rumour that Murali Manohar Joshi\u2019s daughter is married to Shahnawaz Hussain is doing rounds since 2014. On doing Google Reverse Image search, the picture in the post was found to be the one taken during Eid-2018 celebrations at the residence of BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain. The woman seen in the photo is Shahnawaz Hussain\u2019s wife Renu Hussain, but she is not Joshi\u2019s daughter.\n\nShahnawaz Hussain and Renu Hussain had a love marriage and their story is covered by many media outlets. It is no where mentioned that Renu Hissain is the daughter of MM Joshi. MM Joshi has two daughters named Nivedita Joshi and Priyamvada Joshi as per BJP\u2019s official website.\n\nTo sum it up, Murali Manohar Joshi\u2019s daughter is not married to BJP leader \n\nShahnawaz Hussain.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our Facebook live on Fake News (Misinformation)", "lang": "en"}
