It has been carried out in 2010 - 2011 with the data being updated in 2015 and is scheduled to be carried out again from April 2020 onward. Opponents of this exercise, and even states such as West Bengal and Kerala, fear that the data collected would feed into a potential National Register of Citizens (NRC).\n\nThe poster in Hindi translates to, \"Important notice: Everyone is informed that before \"31 March 2020\" to remove your money from all the banks. From \"01 April 2020\", the document of \"NPR\" will be asked in the bank, those who will not have the document, their account would be blocked. Share this information with many people.

Additionally, we did not find any news reports on the claims being made in the viral notice.\n\nThis is not the first time that misinformation linking banks and NPR has circulated online.\n\nScreenshots of KYC forms listing an NPR document as a requirement were viral earlier this year. BOOM had inquired with three banks about the NPR document and the means to acquire it. None of the banks were able to tell BOOM on how exactly to acquire this document. However, all banks made it clear that it was just one on a list of acceptable documents according to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines.\n\nALSO READ : A Letter From NPR: The Accepted KYC Document That No One Knows About\n\nRBI guidelines allow the NPR document as one of the several documents which include Voter ID, Pan Card, Aadhaar Card that can be shared as part of Know Your Customer (KYC).", "lang": "en"}
