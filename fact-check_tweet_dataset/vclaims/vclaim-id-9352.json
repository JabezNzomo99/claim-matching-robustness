The bust that Obama had returned to the British government is not the same bust that Trump now has in the Oval Office, as Trump hinted at in his remarks to the CIA.\n\nBust A was made by the English sculptor Sir Jacob Epstein. It was given to President Lyndon B. Johnson on Oct. 6, 1965. (Here\u2019s Lady Bird Johnson\u2019s diary entry about the gift, which was facilitated by Churchill\u2019s wartime friends, including W. Averell Harriman.) So that bust has been in the White House for more than five decades.\n\nBust B also was made by Epstein. It was provided in July 2001 by then Prime Minister Tony Blair, via the British ambassador, as a loan to President George W. Bush because Bust A was being repaired. Bush said he would keep it in the Oval Office, and various news reports at the time said the bust would be returned once Bush left office.\n\nAccording to a 2010 interview with White House curator William Allman, the decision to return the bust had been made even before Obama arrived, as the loan was scheduled to last only as long as Bush\u2019s presidency. That narrative was confirmed by British ambassador Sir Peter Westmacott just before stepped down in 2015: \u201cTo be honest, we always expected that to leave the Oval Office just like everything else that a president has tends to be changed,\u201d he told The Guardian newspaper. \u201cEven the carpet is usually changed when the president changes.\u201d\n\nBut in 2016, Obama admitted he had decided to remove the bust of Churchill in the Oval Office to make room for one of Martin Luther King Jr. \u201cThere are only so many tables where you can put busts \u2014 otherwise it starts looking a little cluttered,\u201d he said.\n\nBesides, he noted, he already had a bust of Churchill just outside his office in the private residence. \u201cI see it every day, including on weekends, when I\u2019m going into that office to watch a basketball game,\u201d he said.\n\nSo Trump appears to have temporarily moved Bust A to the Oval Office. In the meantime, he seems to have found a way to keep the King bust there, as well.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister has agreed to loan the Churchill bust [Bust B] at the request of the Trump team,\u201d a British Embassy spokesman said. \u201cWe are working out the details on the return.\u201d It should not be a long trip: Bust B is still in the ambassador\u2019s residence, which is next to the vice president\u2019s residence on Massachusetts Avenue.\n\nNote: Trump has indicated that the British made the request first. \u201cThe prime minister is coming over to our country very shortly, and they wanted to know whether I\u2019d like it back,\u201d he said. \u201cI said, \u2018Absolutely.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe Churchill bust story has been a constant source of poor reporting. Sometimes it is incorrectly reported that Blair made the loan of Bust B in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, when in fact he made it two months earlier. Meanwhile, the Obama White House for years misled reporters about whether the president had a hand in the decision to return the bust. Clearly, Obama misunderstood the symbolism of removing the bust from the Oval Office and was embarrassed to admit it.", "lang": "en"}
