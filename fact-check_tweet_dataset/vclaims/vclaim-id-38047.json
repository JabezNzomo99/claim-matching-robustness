Keeping this in mind, we called the police officials in charge of the area in Jalandhar in order to verify whether something of this sort had actually taken place.\n\nSpeaking to The Quint, ACP (Model Town) Dharam Pal said that while the police had actually been called in after ruckus was bestirred over Pakistani flags allegedly being hoisted in the area, they had found the reality to be very different. He said that some people had started a rumour about the flags being Pakistan\u2019s and had called the police to intervene and take action.\n\n\u201cThe police sent a team to the area and took the flags down,\u201d Pal said, but added that after some investigation and scrutiny, it was found that the flags were simply Islamic flags and not Pakistani ones. Pal said that the people who lodged the complaint had not been aware of the difference and had believed the rumours being spread.\n\nPal explained that the Muslim community, who had hoisted the flags, pointed out that they were not Pakistani but Islamic ones, which they had hoisted ahead of Prophet Mohammed\u2019s birthday on 10 November.", "lang": "en"}
