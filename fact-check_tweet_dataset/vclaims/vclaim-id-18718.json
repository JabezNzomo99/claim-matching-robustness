No, that's not true: the story was put out by a satirical website and after it went viral many on social media believed or wished it was real, possibly because they confused it with the real story about a petition to rename a part of Fifth Avenue after Barack Obama.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Alternative Facts on August 17, 2019 titled \"A New York City Petition to Rename Landfill After Donald Trump Has Over 3 Million Signatures\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK -- A petition making the rounds in the Big Apple has gained public attention, and has forced the hashtag #ObamaAve to begin trending on Twitter. With almost 300,000 signatures already, the petition seeks to rename the New York City street that President Donald Trump luxury skyscraper hotel and condominium building calls its home. Trump Tower's address puts the building on the city's famed 5th Avenue, but the petition asks that one square block of Fifth be redubbed \"Barack Obama Avenue.\" Mr. Obama himself has not weighed in on the proposed change, however the city officials who could make such a thing happen have already thrown cold water on the idea. Despite being Democrats, and not exactly fans of their home state's gift to the presidency, renaming the street has been taken off the table.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe story in the opening paragraphs is completely real, there was an initiative to rename the part of Fifth Avenue where Trump Tower stands to \"Barack Obama Avenue\":\n\nBut the next part (about a different petition to rename a landfill) is completely made up:\n\nAs many could relate, it's hard to completely dampen the spirits of New Yorkers, though, and overnight a new, far more popular petition has been making the rounds. \"We have over three million signatures so far, and we've only been passing this petition around for a few hours, really,\" New York resident Katie Williamson told us today in a Skype interview. \"That means so far three-quarters of New Yorkers want to rename one of our landfills as the Donald Trump Dump. It's hard to get New Yorkers to agree on what color the sky is, much less come together to put three million signatures on a piece of paper agreeing to rename something in the city. But that just shows you how much this city hates one of its most famous residents, doesn't it?\"\n\nAlternative Facts has a banner at the top of the site that proudly proclaims \"Your Own Reality\" and a message in the footer that reads \"(C) ALTERNATIVE FACTS (ALL MATERIAL IS SATIRICAL IN NATURE, BILLY.)\".
