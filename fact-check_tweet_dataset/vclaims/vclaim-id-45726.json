That\u2019s despite an activist group urging tech companies to pull their support for the event, which they characterize as \u201csponsoring\u201d Trump\u2019s contentious platform. It\u2019s also despite public tension between Trump and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who last month criticized \u201cfearful voices calling for building walls and distancing people they label as others.\u201d Though Zuckerberg did not name Trump, Trump\u2019s campaign staff nonetheless responded to the comments, saying that Zuckerberg\u2019s \u201cattitude would change\u201d if he moved closer to the U.S. border.\n\nA salient detail that eluded many viewers, however, was that the information they were perusing was several years out-of-date, taken from a four-year-old Fortune article about the 2016 Republican convention. So much so, in fact, that Fortune prepended an editor\u2019s note to their story to alert readers to that fact:\n\n\u201cEditor\u2019s note: In a bid to reduce misleading online sharing of this story, we must reiterate: It was published in 2016.\u201d\n\nAs of this writing, the details of the 2020 Republican National Convention \u2014 including its location \u2014 remain uncertain:\n\nThe Republican National Committee is zeroing in on Jacksonville, Florida, as the new site for President Donald Trump to accept the party\u2019s nomination, according to two sources briefed on plans of RNC officials. The RNC backed out of Charlotte, North Carolina, last week after Gov. Roy Cooper and Mayor Vi Lyles wouldn\u2019t commit to allowing a full convention amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Washington Post first reported that Republicans \u201ctentatively settled\u201d on Jacksonville, citing three unnamed Republican officials. The Republican National Convention is scheduled for Aug. 24 to 27. Charlotte will still hold some of the business meetings, RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said, but the committee is looking for another city for the \u201ccelebration.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
