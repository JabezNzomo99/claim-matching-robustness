Not only are these claims baseless and false, they also reflect the vitriolic trolling that activists, students and many others are exposed to on a daily basis. COVID-19: Another Fake Quote Attributed to Ratan Tata Goes Viral\n\nFacebook and Twitter are flooded with messages claiming that 27-year-old Zargar, who was arrested by the Delhi Police\u2019s special cell on 10 April for her alleged involvement in the Delhi riots and subsequently booked under the draconian Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), learnt about her pregnancy after she underwent a medical examination in Tihar Jail. Several people also linked this to Shaheen Bagh, insinuating that this is the \u201ctruth\u201d behind the Shaheen Bagh protests. An archived version of the Tweet can be found here.

Old Video of Rishi Kapoor Shared as \u2018Last Clip\u2019 From Hospital\n\nThere were two parts to the claim which we decided to debunk:\n\u2022 Safoora learnt about her pregnancy during medical examination in Tihar Jail. After conducting a Google keywords search using \u201cSafoora Zargar arrested\u201d we came across several news reports which mentioned about her pregnancy at the time she was arrested by the Delhi Police\u2019s special cell. Thus, making it evident that her pregnancy was known at the time she was arrested. We reached out to Safoora\u2019s sister Sameeya Zargar, who confirmed that she is married. \u201cSuch vicious attacks on her by social media trolls are the least of our concern right now. We are focusing our energy on finding ways to bring her out of jail.\u201d Safoora\u2019s fellow activist and Jamia student Azhar told us that the claims of Safoora being unmarried are baseless. He also helped us source images from her wedding day. \u201cWe were anticipating that this would happen. That is why a lot us wanted to record her video with her husband on the day of her arrest but he refused,\u201d Azhar told us. The Quint has verified the pictures of Zargar\u2019s wedding day, but has decided to withhold them. We also came across a Deccan Digest interview dated 25 January where Zargar is talking about her husband, 4:17 minutes into the video. Further, we reached out to her husband but he didn\u2019t wish to comment on the matter, at the moment. Clearly, unverified and false information about Zargar is being spread with an intent to malign and discredit the activist. We have noticed similar trends in the past where students have been subjected to online trolling and hate for protesting against the establishment. During the JNU fee hike protest in 2019, similar questions were raised on students character to malign and discredit them.", "lang": "en"}
