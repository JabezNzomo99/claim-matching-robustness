Roosevelt, Lyndon B. Johnson, Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama exceeds Trump\u2019s efforts. As of Sept. 12, his 600th day, Trump had signed 238 bills, most of which were minor. Trump had signed two more bills and joint resolutions than Obama and 14 more than George W. Bush at comparable points, but was still behind every other president since Eisenhower, according to a calculation by Josh Tauberer of GovTrack. He noted that Trump is just behind Obama in the number of pages, indicating that much of the legislation Trump has signed has been about increasing government spending.\n\n\u201c\u2018Democrats can\u2019t find a Smocking Gun tying the Trump campaign to Russia after James Comey\u2019s testimony. No Smocking Gun...No Collusion.\u2019 @FoxNews That\u2019s because there was NO COLLUSION. So now the Dems go to a simple private transaction, wrongly call it a campaign contribution,... ....which it was not (but even if it was, it is only a CIVIL CASE, like Obama\u2019s - but it was done correctly by a lawyer and there would not even be a fine. Lawyer\u2019s liability if he made a mistake, not me). Cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced. WITCH HUNT!\u201d (Dec. 10)\n\n\u201cCohen\u2019s commission of two campaign finance crimes on the eve of the 2016 election for President of the United States struck a blow to one of the core goals of the federal campaign finance laws: transparency,\u201d they wrote in a brief filed Dec. 7. \u201cWhile many Americans who desired a particular outcome to the election knocked on doors, toiled at phone banks, or found any number of other legal ways to make their voices heard, Cohen sought to influence the election from the shadows. He did so by orchestrating secret and illegal payments to silence two women who otherwise would have made public their alleged extramarital affairs with Individual-1 [Trump]. In the process, Cohen deceived the voting public by hiding alleged facts that he believed would have had a substantial effect on the election.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith respect to both payments, Cohen acted with the intent to influence the 2016 presidential election,\u201d they wrote. \u201cCohen coordinated his actions with one or more members of the campaign, including through meetings and phone calls, about the fact, nature, and timing of the payments. In particular, and as Cohen himself has now admitted, with respect to both payments, he acted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1 [Trump]. As a result of Cohen\u2019s actions, neither woman spoke to the press prior to the election.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
