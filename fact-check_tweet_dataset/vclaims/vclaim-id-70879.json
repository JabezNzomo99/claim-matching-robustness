In their debate, host Jon Stewart rejected that conclusion in the strongest terms.\n\n\"If there is ever any use of federal power that is justified, would it not be to end the most horrific, abhorrent practice in the history of mankind?\" Stewart asked.\n\n\"After it had tried everything else,\" Napolitano replied. \"Like abolishing the Fugitive Slave Act, which Lincoln enforced and his judges enforced and his federal marshals enforced until the Civil War was over and Lincoln was nearly dead.\"\n\nWe are fact-checking several claims from the Civil War debate between Napolitano, a libertarian pundit and former judge, and Stewart. Here we\u2019re looking at Napolitano\u2019s claim that Lincoln enforced something called the Fugitive Slave Act until the Civil War was over.\n\nmade it easier for slave owners to use the federal government to get back the people who had escaped bondage. If a person found refuge in a free state, the act expanded the number of federal officials who could order their rendition back into slavery. The act also simplified the legal steps required by the owner to prove his claim and required the state to bear any costs involved.\n\nThe law was part of a package of changes designed to ease tensions over slavery known as the Compromise of 1850.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that federal officials enforced the Fugitive Slave Act before the war, but Napolitano said it continued during the war and that enforcement took place under Lincoln himself.\n\nThat specific claim is oversimplified. (Napolitano did not respond to our request for comment.)\n\nThe picture is a bit complicated because federal policy changed over time as Congress and Lincoln navigated through the challenges of undermining the Confederacy, keeping peace within Union border states and ending slavery.\n\nBy the time Lincoln took office in March 1861, seven states had seceded but war had not yet broken out. That came a month later. Lincoln\u2019s offered the slave states, a group that included states still within the Union, full enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act. Lincoln said that so long as the law was on the books, he would follow it. In a further effort to stave off war, he said \"there will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people anywhere.\"\n\nIt would be difficult to overstate the importance Lincoln placed on the rule of law. In many of his writings, he expresses a keen tension between his personal values and the laws of Congress and the Constitution.\n\nWhen the war started, two policies emerged, one for the South and one for the North. By August 1861, Congress had passed the , which authorized Union forces to seize any slaves used by Confederate forces. Military commanders in the field, however, had different policies. Even though the Secretary of War at the time ordered officers to provide protection to slaves, some refused them sanctuary.\n\nAt about the same time, escaped slaves from Maryland (a border state) and unionists living in Virginia (a Southern state) were coming into the District of Columbia. Historian that Lincoln advised local authorities to allow Virginia owners to reclaim their slaves. The marshal for the district, Ward Lamon, a close friend and Lincoln appointee, supported the policy, arguing that the Fugitive Slave Act required it.\n\nUniversity of Massachusetts historian Manisha Sinha, who appeared alongside Stewart and Napolitano on The Daily Show, told us that Lincoln balanced a desire to end slavery with his desire to win the war.\n\n\"In the first two years of the war he was willing to respect the rights of slaveholders in the border slave states simply to prevent them from seceding,\" Sinha said.\n\nIn July 1862, Congress passed the , which was a broader statute and allowed Union forces to shelter escaped slaves from owners in any of the Confederate states. That still left slaves in Union states at legal risk if they got away from their owners.\n\nLincoln\u2019s Emancipation Proclamation ended slavery in the Confederate states in January 1863, but it wasn\u2019t until passage of the 13th Amendment in January 1865 that the United States abolished slavery everywhere within its borders. In June 1864, Congress repealed the Fugitive Slave Act.\n\nThe Civil War ended a year later, in spring 1865.\n\nNapolitano said Lincoln, his marshals and his judges enforced the Fugitive Slave Act until the war was over. The record is much more complicated. Lincoln and other federal officials did enforce the law in some instances in the Union states in the early part of the war but not in every state and not consistently. The policy was quite different for the Confederate states. In that same period, Lincoln\u2019s military and Congress moved to protect slaves who escaped from Confederate owners.\n\nLincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation mid-way through the war, freeing all slaves in Confederate states.\n\nNapolitano repeated the word \"enforced\" three times for emphasis. The record is much more mixed and certainly, Napolitano gets his dates wrong. Congress repealed the Fugitive Slave Act in 1864, a year before the war ended.\n\nThe judge\u2019s words have a sliver of accuracy but overall, we rate his claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
