The largest contribution was reported as $713,082, made on July 29. The same week, two other contributions were made \u2014 one valued at $112,560, and another for $150,080. On Aug. 5, three days before the election, the committee made a final contribution valued at $25,710.82.\n\nThe reported contributions coincided with a series of television ads attacking Greitens that aired in the five days before the primary. A group called Jobs and Opportunity is credited for paying for the ad. A YouTube video of the ad was posted on July 29, about a week before the primary.\n\nAccording to Koster's campaign finance expenditures, his campaign normally pays between $500,000 and $700,000 for media advertising. No other single campaign expenditure comes close to that amount. That puts the PAC's contribution in perspective \u2014 it's unlikely a $1 million in-kind contribution would buy anything else.\n\nGreitens is right: the Democratic Governors Association is behind money given to his Democratic opponent. The Washington, D.C. address for Jobs and Opportunity that the Koster campaign reported to the Missouri Ethics Commission is also the address for the Democratic Governors Association. A week before the election, Jobs and Opportunity made a $1 million in-kind contribution to Koster, which coincided with a TV ad attacking Greitens.\n\nPACs that act independently from a candidate do not have to report contributions to that candidate's campaign, said James Thomas, the campaign treasurer for Catherine Hanaway, who was a Republican gubernatorial candidate in the primary. But when the PAC is in contact with the candidate, related contributions need to be reported.\n\nSince Missouri has no limits on campaign contributions, it's okay that the PAC talked to Koster's campaign. It would be a different story if this were a federal election, though, Thomas said. Federal PACs can only contribute $5,000 to a candidate, so Jobs and Opportunity\u2019s $1 million in-kind contribution would be illegal.\n\nAfter the primary, Greitens said no other Democratic groups launched attack ads against any other Republican gubernatorial candidate, according to the Associated Press. We also asked Austin Chambers, Greitens' campaign manager, why Greitens repeatedly cited President Barack Obama's involvement in the ad buy.\n\nChambers said the company the PAC hired to purchase the airtime for the ad is the same Obama has used for his ads. The company, named GMMB, produced ads for Obama during both of his presidential campaigns.", "lang": "en"}
