Sheep produce about 30 litres of methane a day. If (New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda) Ardern was serious about addressing \"climate change\" shouldn't she start by culling the entire sheep population of NZ?\u201d\n\nOne Nation Senator Malcolm Roberts says New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern should consider culling all of her country\u2019s methane-producing sheep before criticising the Australian government on emissions and climate change. [1]\n\nMs Ardern has drawn the ire of conservative figures, including broadcaster Alan Jones, after saying Australia \"has to answer to the Pacific\" on its emissions reductions at the Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu which ran from August 13 to 16. [2] [3]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined Mr Roberts\u2019 claim that New Zealand has 60 million sheep, each producing 30 litres of methane each day.\n\nAccording to New Zealand's official data agency, Stats NZ, the most recent farm census was conducted in 2017 and recorded 27.5 million sheep in the country. [4]\n\nA provisional update in June 2018 recorded a 200,000 drop in the number of sheep, to 27.3 million. [5]\n\nAccording to CSIRO senior technician Andrew Toovey, sheep produce between 25 and 30 litres of methane - a greenhouse gas - each day. PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) Australia also claims sheep produce 30 litres of methane per day. [6][7]\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s Greenhouse Gas inventory for 2017, released in April 2019, showed sheep produced 12.7 per cent of the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Dairy cattle accounted for 22.5 per cent, while electricity generation created 4.4 per cent. [8]\n\nIn 2019 New Zealand introduced a bill to reduce emissions of methane by animals to 10 per cent below 2017 levels by 2030, and between 24 and 47 per cent below 2017 levels by 2050. [9]\n\nIn 2017, New Zealand emitted the equivalent of about 80.9 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. Australia emitted 534.7 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. [10][11]\n\nBased on the above evidence, AAP FactCheck found Mr Roberts\u2019 claim to be ambiguous. New Zealand has less than half the number of sheep Mr Roberts claimed it did, but sheep do produce between 25 and 30 litres of methane each day.", "lang": "en"}
