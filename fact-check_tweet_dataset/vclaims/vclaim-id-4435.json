A reader\n\nThe statistic was from an infographic by the\n\nis part of the network\u2019s\n\n, which pairs young boys with mentors for six years to help them \u201cbecome better men in their societies\u201d.\n\n\u201cDid you know? 57% of South African fathers to children aged 15 years or younger are absent from their lives,\u201d their infographic states. It cites\n\nThe figure was calculated from the share of children whose fathers were dead (11.2%) and those whose biological fathers were alive, but absent from the household (45.7%).\n\nevery year, so much more recent data is available.\n\nTo be considered a resident of a household, a biological father needs to spend \u201cat least four nights on average per week, for four weeks\u201d living there, Stats SA\u2019s deputy director for service delivery statistics, Casment Mahlwele, told Africa Check.\n\na \u201cperson under the age of 18 years\u201d.\n\nsurvey found the biological father of 61.8% of children younger than 18 were absent from the household. This is similar to\n\nof 1.3 million households estimated a higher figure of 64.1%. It was made up of 8.7% of children younger than 18 whose father had died and 55.4% whose biological father was alive but didn\u2019t live with them.\n\nThis indicator doesn\u2019t tell us whether biological fathers are involved in raising their children, though.\n\n\u201cThe fact that a biological father does not live with a child does not mean that the father is not involved in the child\u2019s life, nor does living with a child mean involvement either,\u201d Wessel van den Berg told Africa Check.\n\nVan den Berg manages the Children\u2019s Rights and Positive Parenting unit at\n\n, a South African nongovernmental organisation that works to promote the equitable treatment of men, women and children.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, a child may live with a man who fulfils a caregiving function, and who is not their biological father,\u201d Van den Berg added. \"This man will not be counted as a father in current household surveys.\"\n\nMore than this, fathers who only come home on weekends are not considered household members because of how Stats SA defines residency.\n\n\u201cA person or father coming only on weekends will not be counted as part of the household as we run the risk of counting or enumerating that person again in a different place of house during the week,\u201d Mahlwele told Africa Check.\n\n(HSRC), plans to release South Africa\u2019s first State of the Fathers report on 12 July 2018.

This data excludes children raised by fathers who didn\u2019t live with them and men not related to them, but who play a fatherlike role.", "lang": "en"}
