It\u2019s claimed that the image is from India.\n\nTwitter user @shaista04444 posted the viral image. It has over 300 retweets. (archived link)\n\nThe image is circulated on social media along with Hindi text, \u201cLook at the condition of schools in the country with the world\u2019s tallest statue.\u201d\n\nAlt News performed a reverse image search on Google and found that the image was tweeted byImran Lashari, who works at Ministry of Foreign Affair, Islamabad in Pakistan as per his Twitter bio. He had tweeted the image in 2017 tagging Islamabad-based reporter Rauf Klasra. Lashari wrote, \u201cGovernment girls primary school wara sehraan tehsil karor district Layyah southpunjab whats your remarks about punjab Government. @KlasraRauf\u201d Taking this as a clue, a further search led us to an article from 2015 published in Pakistan-based Siasat. As per the website, this school is in Pakistan\u2019s Punjab. We also found that a Pakistani Twitter user had posted the viral image in 2015. In his tweet, he had tagged Sheikh Rashid Ahmad, federal minister for railways and chief of Awami Muslim League. The viral image was earlier fact-checked by Fact Crescendo in February. Thus the social media claim that the image shows children from India are false. The image is from Pakistan and at least five years old.", "lang": "en"}
