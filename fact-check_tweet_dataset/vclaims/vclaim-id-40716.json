So this is the reason for the fake impeachment inquiry!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no record of Pelosi ever saying the quote. It is actually a Fox News correspondent\u2019s characterization of a memo Pelosi sent to Democrats mid November.\n\nThe House voted Dec. 18 to impeach Trump on two counts \u2013 abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The impeachment vote came months after a whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Facebook post, which features a black-and-white photo of Pelosi, attributes a quote about impeachment to the House speaker. It has been shared more than 8,800 times.\n\n\u201cIt is dangerous to let the voters decide Trump\u2019s fate,\u201d the Facebook post credits Pelosi with saying.

It does not appear in ProPublica\u2019s collection of her public statements released during the 116th Congress. A search of her social media accounts didn\u2019t turn up any instances either.\n\nMike Emanuel, the chief congressional correspondent for Fox News, actually said the words during a live segment. He was referencing a Nov. 18 open letter to Democrats in which Pelosi discussed impeachment.\n\n\u201cHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi circulated a memo to Democrats tonight telling them it would be dangerous to let voters decide President Trump\u2019s fate when it comes to the Ukraine investigation,\u201d said Emanuel.\n\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted the quote shortly after Emanuel\u2019s segment.\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi just stated that \u2018it is dangerous to let the voters decide Trump\u2019s fate.\u2019 @FoxNews In other words, she thinks I\u2019m going to win and doesn\u2019t want to take a chance on letting the voters decide,\u201d reads his tweet. \u201cLike Al Green, she wants to change our voting system. Wow, she\u2019s CRAZY!\u201d\n\nEmanuel was not directly quoting Pelosi but rather offering his interpretation of the contents of Pelosi\u2019s memo. Trump and some Facebook users appear to have mistaken Emanuel\u2019s characterization of the memo as a direct quote.\n\nHere\u2019s what Pelosi actually wrote in her Nov. 18 memo:\n\n\u201cThe weak response to these hearing has been, \u2018Let the election decide.\u2019 That dangerous position only adds to the urgency of our action, because the President is jeopardizing the integrity of the 2020 elections.\u201d\n\nDrew Hammill, a spokesman for Pelosi, told FactCheck.org that Emanuel\u2019s paraphrasing distorted Pelosi\u2019s actual words and meaning.", "lang": "en"}
