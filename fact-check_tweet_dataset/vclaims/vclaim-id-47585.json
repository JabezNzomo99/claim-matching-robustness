You are a Legend Rishiji you will always be in our hearts and mind.\" The tweet has now been deleted.\n\n\n\nOther Twitter users, including News Nation anchor Deepak Chaurasia, posted the same video with similar caption, that hinted at the video being Kapoor's last.\n\nIndia Today also posted the video on its Twitter handle with a caption that read, \"Take a look at the last visuals of legendary actor #RishiKapoor.\" This tweet was also deleted later on.\n\n\n\nWe also found the video being shared on Facebook with the exact same caption.\n\nA quick search on Google with relevant keyword searches led us to the exact same video, uploaded on YouTube by user Dheeraj Kumar Sanu on February 3, 2020.\n\nBOOM search for social media handles of the user, and found an Instagram post by Sanu on February 6, where he is seen taking a selfie with Kapoor at the hospital.\n\nWe also found news reports suggesting that Kapoor was admitted to a hospital in Delhi in early February with an infection. Kapoor had also tweeted about the matter on February 4, clarifying that he was hospitalised with an infection due to pollution and a low count of neutrophils.\n\n\n\nThe video was taken by Dheeraj Kumar Sanu during that particular visit, which predates Kapoor death by nearly three months.", "lang": "en"}
