The Health Foundation also says that disadvantage in these areas is often becoming more acute for young people.\n\nWe haven\u2019t seen an explicit statement that millennials have worse overall health prospects than their parents. Nor does the Health Foundation try to provide a definitive millennial bill of health.\n\nIt states: \u201cThe gains made as a society in improving the health of previous generations may well be eroded by the precariousness and instability of the lives some young people are facing.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve asked the Health Foundation whether the Times\u2019 claim is an accurate reflection of its findings.\n\nThe report looks at the \u201csocial determinants\u201d of health\n\nThese are \u201cconditions that promote good long-term health and wellbeing throughout adult life\u2026 the combined effects of education, employment, housing, relationships with family and community\u201d.\n\nThe Health Foundation identifies key \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d that underpin these: \u201ca place to call home, secure and rewarding work, and supportive relationships with their friends, family and community\u201d. It says there is \u201cstrong evidence that health inequalities are largely determined by inequalities in these areas\u201d.\n\nIt points to evidence in each of these areas, showing how lacking these building blocks can increase stress and anxiety, lower living standards, damage self-esteem, and increase loneliness\u2014all of which negatively affect an individual\u2019s health.\n\nWhat does young peoples\u2019 social health look like?\n\nThe Health Foundation carried out research on social health with 2,000 people in the UK aged 22-26, and also drew on wider research about millennial lifestyles. The research included panels, app-based diaries, social media analysis and online surveys.\n\nThe Health Foundation says \u201cIn some aspects of young people\u2019s health we have made great progress. But these gains may be temporary, as their current experiences erode their mental health and future health prospects\u201d.\n\nThe Health Foundation looked at a wide range of evidence in its report. Some of the evidence it looked at in terms of work and finances included that millennials \u201care at risk of becoming the first generation to earn less than their predecessors\u201d, and young people have a higher debt to income ratio than older age groups. They\u2019re also more likely to be on zero-hours contracts (36% of all zero-hours contracts were held by 16-24 year olds in the last three months of 2017).\n\nIt adds: \u201cRecent research has found that at the age of 25, people on zero-hours contracts were less likely to report feeling healthy than those in more secure work and reported more symptoms of psychological distress.\u201d The Health Foundation also reported that almost half of recent graduates in work are employed in \u2018non-graduate\u2019 roles, and 28% of working young people \u201cfeel trapped in a cycle of jobs they do not want\u201d.\n\nIt notes that \u201cYoung people today are more likely to go to university than ever before\u201d, and that \u201cHigher levels of education have been associated with better future health.\u201d However, they add that it\u2019s also \u201cunknown whether highly educated individuals who have few opportunities and low incomes will continue to experience the same strong health prospects\u201d.\n\nIn terms of friends, mental health and loneliness, the Health Foundation reports that \u201cthe proportion of young people who feel they have someone to rely on has decreased in recent years\u201d. The number of young people reporting mental health issues, like anxiety or depression, has also been rising.", "lang": "en"}
