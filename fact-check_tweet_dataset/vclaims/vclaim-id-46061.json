Experts have suggested that a variety of factors may be responsible, including disparities in income and health insurance and a higher rate of pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe question of racial disparities in coronavirus impact came up during an April 8 news conference with Lovely Warren, the mayor of Rochester, N.Y.\n\nWarren opened the press conference by saying, \"I'm going to answer some questions you have regarding disparities across the country happening in the African American community as it pertains to the coronavirus and the number of deaths and the number of people being diagnosed with it.\"\n\nA reporter asked, \"What are we seeing locally here in Rochester? How badly is Rochester being impacted, especially the minority population?\"\n\nWarren responded, \"We are not seeing, at a high rate, that level of disparity right now,\" Warren said. \"We do believe if we do not change the social distancing, if we do not stay at home, we will see the level of disparity that we see across the country. \u2026 Today we are basically on par, a little bit up, from the population numbers, but we don\u2019t see that disparity as much here in Monroe County as we\u2019re seeing across the country.\"\n\nHowever, the disparities were already evident on the day Warren held the press conference.\n\nOn the same day as the press conference, the Monroe County Department of Health released the racial and ethnic breakdown of coronavirus hospitalizations in the county, both in non-intensive care units and ICUs, as well as deaths from the virus.\n\nThe health department data shows that for African Americans, the percentage of deaths from coronavirus was slightly higher than their share of the population -- African American residents accounted for 18.2% of deaths, compared to 16.2% of the county\u2019s overall population. That was in line with Warren\u2019s comment.\n\nHowever, the hospitalization rates for African Americans in the county were significantly higher. African Americans accounted for 27.9% of the non-ICU hospitalizations in the county and 53.8% of ICU hospitalizations.\n\nMeanwhile, non-ICU hospitalizations were disproportionately high for Hispanics -- 18.6% of such hospitalizations, compared to an overall 9% share of the population.\n\nWarren did acknowledge this fact in passing later in her press conference, saying, \"What we do know is that people in the ICU, people of color, are in the ICU at a higher rate than other folks.\" However, on multiple occasions during the press conference she referred to the disparities as minor.\n\nJustin Roj, the mayor\u2019s director of communications and special events, said Warren stands by her statement.\n\nA footnote: Subsequent data has shown that the racial disparity has grown. Here\u2019s a look at the data through April 17:\n\nThe data shows that through April 17, African American hospitalization rates had grown to 67% of ICU hospitalizations and 39% of non-ICU hospitalization rates. And the share of deaths represented by African Americans rose to 24%, which exceeds African Americans\u2019 16% share of the county\u2019s population.\n\nMeanwhile, Hispanics have accounted for 22% of ICU hospitalizations, which is more than double their 9% of the population.\n\nReferring to racial comparisons on coronavirus statistics in Monroe County, N.Y., Warren said the impact on minorities is \"basically on par, a little bit up, from the population numbers,\" meaning that \"we don\u2019t see that disparity as much here.\"\n\nThat was essentially accurate when looking at the share of deaths from the coronavirus. But at the time of her comment, African Americans accounted for a significantly higher share of ICU and non-ICU hospitalizations in the county, and the same was the case for Hispanics and non-ICU hospitalizations.\n\nThe statement is partially accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Half True.", "lang": "en"}
