But here\u2019s a quick history lesson to understand why this FALSE.\n\nBy simple arithmetic, it will be wrong say an organisation birthed in 1974 will be 50 in 2019!\n\nDubawa also ran a quick online verification of the misleading broadcast and discovered that it is becoming a trend that people share yearly, whether mistakenly or with full knowledge of its falsehood.\n\nA similar broadcast was shared on WhatsApp in 2017 and British Airways stated then that it weas not giving away free tickets as the hoax message suggested.\n\nLuane Lavery, Brand communication manager for British Airways was quoted then to have said: \u201cWe are aware of the chain messages that are being circulated via social media. We can confirm that it is a hoax. British Airways is not involved in any give away.\u201d\n\nAgain, in 2016, a viral post claimed to be a competition held by British Airways, proposed to give out 100 \u2018All Inclusive first Class Trips to any destination worldwide\u2019, including five star hotel \u2018of your choosing\u2019 and \u00a35,000 in cash was also verified and discovered to be false.\n\nLike the other hoaxes, the recent or latest broadcast asked clients to follow the same steps as in the previous similar hoaxes that were checked to be FALSE!\n\nOUR CONCLUSION? We call this FALSE!", "lang": "en"}
