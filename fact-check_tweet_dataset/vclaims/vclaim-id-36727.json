It has been viewed more than 136,000 times.\n\nThe post\u2019s Chinese-language caption translates to English as: \"Breaking: Iran acting foolish again, suddenly launched rocket projectiles at the American base in Iraq! But were basically intercepted by antiaircraft fire, spectacular! Astonishing! Awesome, the United States!\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe video was also shared with a similar claim here on Facebook; and here and here on YouTube.\n\nOn January 8, 2020, Iran did fire missiles at Iraqi military bases housing US forces in retaliation for the US strike that killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani the previous week, AFP reported here.\n\nHowever, the claim made about the video is false.\n\nA reverse image search on Google and keyword search found the same footage from ARMA 3 was published in this longer YouTube video on June 24, 2019.\n\nThe two-minute 53-second video has been embedded below.\n\nThe video\u2019s description translates to English as: \u201cPhalanx Tomahawk The moment of a Cius CIWS Phalanx cruise missile being shot down by a BGM-109 Tomahawk ARMA3 cruise missile\u201d.\n\nAt the end of the video, Japanese text appears on the screen which translates to English as: \u201cThis video is a fiction. The characters, names, events are fictitious and have nothing to do with reality.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading posts (L) and the YouTube video (R):\n\nThe same video was also debunked here by a BBC journalist on January 9, 2020.\n\nThe same video has also circulated in Portuguese and Spanish social media posts with other misleading claims, as debunked by AFP\u2019s Portuguese fact check team here and Spanish fact check team here.\n\nBohemia Interactive, the company that developed ARMA 3, confirmed to AFP\u2019s Portuguese team that the video was from the game.\n\nIn an email, the company stated: \u201cWe are sure that the YouTube video is from ARMA 3, made by one of our players. It should be noted that our ARMA games can be modified (adapted, NDLR) by their users and that people can create their own scenarios with the game editor. As such, what you are seeing in this video is not the ARMA 3 experience pattern, it seems to be a modified version of the game and a custom scenario made by players.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
