Specifically, the event \"will start on November 15 at 3:00 am and will most likely last until November 30, 4:45 pm.\"\n\nThe post also quotes NASA administrator Charles Bolden as saying the so-called \"blackout event\" will raise the Earth\u2019s temperature up to 8 degrees, but should have no lasting effects. \"This event would be similar to what Alaskans experience in the winter,\" Bolden is quoted. For the record, Bolden resigned on Jan. 20, 2017.\n\nThere also was something in there about the alignment of Venus and Jupiter and a hydrogen explosion in space, but that doesn\u2019t matter, because the story is a persistent Internet concoction that isn\u2019t true.\n\nThe NewsForMeToday.com post doesn\u2019t link to any official source, a sure warning sign of an unreliable news report, but does cite a Jan. 12, 2017, post on ReflectionofMind.org.\n\nThat site, in turn, links back to a now-defunct page on GlobalRevolutionNetwork.com, which the Internet Archive told us was originally dated Oct. 24, 2016, and warned of the event happening in November of that year.\n\nThis unfounded rumor goes back to at least 2015, and has been posted time and again. Dates and details may change (one version said a solar storm would darken the Earth for six days in December), but none of them were correct.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t find any evidence of NASA making such an announcement, of course. We contacted NASA about the possibility an inky fortnight of celestial shenanigans, but didn\u2019t immediately hear back.\n\nThe fake story about Earth going dark has been around for some time, but it\u2019s time we bring this hoax to light.\n\nWe rate it Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
