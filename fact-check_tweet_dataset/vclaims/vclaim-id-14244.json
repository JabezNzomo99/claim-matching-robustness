In the first clip, Gandhi says that he wants to tell the poor and the other citizens of the country that the \"line\" will be 12,000. In the clip, he goes on to add that Rs 12,000 per month will be the amount.\n\nIn the next clip, Gandhi says that 20 percent of the poorest families in the country will be given Rs 72,000 every year.\n\nThe post says: \u0905\u092d\u0940 \u0938\u0947 \u0918\u094b\u091f\u093e\u0932\u093e \u0936\u0941\u0930\u0942? ( The scam has already started?), questioning where the rest of the Rs 72,000 will go, considering that Gandhi promises Rs 12,000 per month, which equals Rs 1,44,000 per year.\n\nMajor Surendra Poonia was among those sharing the post. His post on Twitter had 6.8K retweets and 15K likes at the time this story was published. He pointed out the math, asking where the remainder of the Rs 1,44,000 would go.", "lang": "en"}
