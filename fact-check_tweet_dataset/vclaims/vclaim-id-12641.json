Dati WPS, ngayon pati Benham Rise! Kailan pa kayo magigising sa bangungot nito?\u201d (When will we wake up from this nightmare?)\n\nThis supposed declaration by Wang cannot be found on the website of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the website of the Chinese embassy in the Philippines, the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs website, nor in any news report from credible news organizations.\n\nRappler has sent an email to the Chinese embassy to further verify the supposed quote, but it has yet to reply.\n\nRappler asked Silent No More PH and Mariz Cruz about the source of the quote, but they have not responded as of posting time. Commenters in Silent No More\u2019s post also asked them about the source of the supposed quote, but the page has yet to reply.\n\nThe Philippines and China signed 3 agreements during Wang\u2019s recent visit to Davao on October 29. While there is no mention of maritime issues in the agreements, Wang said the two countries can \u201cshelve differences and pursue joint development\u201d in the West Philippine Sea.\n\nBenham Rise, which is not a disputed area, was not reportedly discussed during Wang's trip. The government permitted a 33-day maritime research of Chinese scientists, which started on January 24, covering the \"eastern side of Luzon and Mindanao\" including Benham Rise.\n\nA 13-million-hectare underwater plateau, Benham Rise is located off the coast of Aurora. The United Nations in 2012 considered it part of the Philippines' extended continental shelf. (FAST FACTS: What you should know about Benham Rise)\n\nThis is the third time that Rappler has checked Silent No More\u2019s misleading claims. The first was its post listing down misleading \u201cBuild, Build, Build\u201d figures in July, followed by another post in October saying that a Commission on Audit report supposedly flagged \"unliquidated funds\" of former communications assistant secretary Margaux \u201cMocha\u201d Uson and former foreign secretary Alan Peter Cayetano. \u2013 Miguel Imperial/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
