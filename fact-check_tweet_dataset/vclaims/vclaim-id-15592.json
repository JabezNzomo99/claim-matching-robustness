Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim 1: Congress hoarding Kerala reads: \u201cIf you want to eat cow\u2019s meat then bring Congress into power\u201d Fact: The hoarding does not have anything specific to cow meat but asks about the killings in the name of food habits. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the Malayalam text on the hoarding is translated into English, it reads \u201cKilling in the name of food? In this nation? At this time? We don\u2019t want primitive rule! Vote for Congress! \u201c. It is very different from the translation given in the post. While the focus of the hoarding is on the killings of humans in the name of food habits, the claim emphasizes cow meat. The post claims that Congress supports killing cows whereas the actual translation questions the killing of humans in the name of food habits. So, the translation in the post is very different from the actual content on the hoarding.\n\nTo sum it up, the hoarding in Malayalam does not read \u201cIf you want to eat cow\u2019s meat then bring Congress into power\u201d. It has been mistranslated.", "lang": "en"}
