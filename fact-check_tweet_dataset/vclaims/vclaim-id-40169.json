Did Bernie Sanders say at a Democratic debate that the planet has only eight or nine years before major cities go under water? No, that's not true: What the Democratic presidential hopeful said was that, unless \"weget our act together within the next eight or nine years,\" the rising sea levels would inevitably flood major cities. Instead of saying the cities would be flooded in that time, he was warning that decisive action to slow climate change must be taken in the decade.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Flag & Cross on November 22, 2019, titled \"Bernie At Dem Debate: The Planet Only Has '8 or 9 Years' Before Major Cities Go Underwater\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nWhat the scientists are telling us is if we don't get our act together within the next eight or nine years, we're talking about cities all over the world, major cities going underwater, we're talking about increased drought, we're talking about increased extreme weather disturbances.\n\nSo, he said decisive action must be taken to reverse the trend of climate change in that timeframe; he did not issue an explicit warning that cities were about to go underwater before the next decade was up. Put simply, words were taken out of context by many outlets.\n\nIn fact, some 97 percent of scientists have agreed that climate change is causing irreparable harm to the globe, and that temperature increases and worsening weather conditions will start around 2030 if the world does not act to reverse human-caused climate damage.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes flagandcross.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site can generally be trusted to maintain journalistic standards.
