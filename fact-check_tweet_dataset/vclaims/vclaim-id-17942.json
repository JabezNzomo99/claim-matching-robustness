Scientific consensus says a more realistic rise is 0.33 to 1.33 yards above current levels by 2100.\n\nStein made her claim in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 23 during a press conference in which she discussed her Aug. 21 visit to flooded areas in Louisiana and the natural disaster\u2019s link to climate change.\n\nAccording to a 2016 report by the National Academies of Sciences, global warming is expected to lead to more moisture in the atmosphere. This, in turn, can increase the frequency of extreme rainfall events like the one that recently took place in Louisiana.\n\nPrimarily affecting regions around Baton Rouge and Lafayette, the flood damaged tens of thousands of homes and killed 13 people, reported NPR. The Red Cross also called the flood \u201clikely the worst natural disaster in the United States since 2012\u2019s Superstorm Sandy.\u201d\n\nStein did accurately state, \u201cAny one storm cannot be definitively pegged to climate change, but when you see so many at such extreme levels, there\u2019s no question, according to the scientists, that this is a consequence of warmer air that holds much more water.\u201d But then she moved on to exaggerate the extent of projected sea level rise.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Stein has exaggerated the extent of projected global sea level rise. But it is the first time she has cited Hansen\u2019s work while making her claim.\n\nHansen, a climate scientist at Columbia University, and colleagues did conclude, \u201cContinued high fossil fuel emissions this century are predicted to yield \u2026 sea level rise, reaching several meters over a timescale of 50\u2013150 years\u201d in a study published in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics in March 2016.\n\nHowever, reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which are both collaborations of hundreds of scientists, project a much smaller rise over a longer period than Hansen.\n\nThe 2013 IPCC report predicts an average rise of between 0.26 to 0.98 meters (1 meter = 1.09 yards) in the global sea level by 2100, with the higher end entailing a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario.\n\nThe 2016 Global Change report similarly projects a 1 to 4 feet (3 feet = 1 yard) rise by 2100. However, the report also states, \u201cIn the context of risk-based analysis, some decision makers may wish to use a wider range of scenarios, from 8 inches to 6.6 feet by 2100.\u201d Still, 6.6 feet translates to 2.2 yards, which is not \u201cmany\u201d yards, and it also would not occur in \u201cas soon as 50 years.\u201d\n\nIn his paper, Hansen and colleagues argue that ice covering the North and South poles will melt at rates much faster than predicted by the IPCC and others. Instead of a linear rate, the researchers argue the rate will grow exponentially, doubling every 10, 20 or 40 years. This will lead to \u201cmulti-meter\u201d global mean sea level rise in about 50, 100 or 200 years, respectively, the authors conclude.\n\nBut the group also admits that, while the data they analyzed are \u201cconsistent with\u201d a multi-meter sea level rise in around 50 years, they \u201ccannot exclude slower responses.\u201d This is why the researchers give a timescale of 50 to 150 years to reach several meters of sea level rise.\n\nIn an email to us, Hansen also explained, \u201cIf we stay on business-as-usual high emissions, I would say that several meters [of sea level rise] is unlikely in 50 years, though possible. In 100 years it is likely, and I can\u2019t see how it could be avoided in 200 years.\u201d\n\nBut back in March, Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University and a lead author on a chapter of the IPCC\u2019s third report, told The Guardian: \u201cI\u2019m always hesitant to ignore the findings and warnings of James Hansen; he has proven to be so very prescient when it comes to his early prediction about global warming. That having been said, I\u2019m unconvinced that we could see melting rates over the next few decades anywhere near his exponential predictions, and everything else is contingent upon those melting rates being reasonable.\u201d\n\nIn 1988, Hansen, then a NASA scientist, testified before Congress on the dangers of global warming. His testimony instigated broader awareness of the issue, which has led some to call him the \u201cfather of climate change awareness.\u201d\n\nSteven Goodbred Jr., an environmental scientist at Vanderbilt University and expert on sea level rise in Bangladesh, agrees with Mann that Hansen\u2019s warnings should be heeded, but also said Hansen\u2019s latest findings are over the top. \u201cMeters of sea level rise would require major collapse of Greenland or East Antarctic ice sheets,\u201d Goodbred told us by email. \u201cWhile improbable, the evidence that Hansen et al put forth warns us not to think impossible.\u201d\n\nNot as Simple as Sea Level Rise\n\nGoodbred also told us issues in Bangladesh, which Stein mentioned specifically, can\u2019t be boiled down to sea level rise. The Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers, which flow from China and India to Bangladesh, together \u201cdeliver the largest sediment load on earth\u201d at around 1 billion metric tons per year, he explained. \u201cThat sediment distributed across Bangladesh\u2019s low-lying coastal region could keep pace\u201d with the current rate of sea level rise, \u201cperhaps with relatively limited consequences (though certainly not none).\u201d\n\nAlong these lines, \u201cany reduction in that supply would harm the system\u2019s ability to respond to sea level rise,\u201d added Goodbred. \u201cThreats to sediment delivery (that are more probable than Hansen et al scenarios) include dam construction, water diversion, and increased irrigation/water extraction in upstream areas of India and China.\u201d Many of these modifications to the river systems are already planned or ongoing, he said, and represent as much of a threat to Bangladesh as sea level rise does.\n\nMann told us the situation in Florida and Manhattan, which Stein also pointed to specifically, can\u2019t be reduced to sea level rise either. \u201cEven 5-6 m of sea level rise would not submerge New York City, or most of Florida,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDue to the threat to our coastlines from the combined effect of sea level rise and potentially more potent hurricanes, we might indeed be looking at managed retreat from coastal regions like Miami and New York City on a timeframe of 50 years,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it wouldn\u2019t be because of inundation of these regions. It would be because the cost to insure property would become prohibitive given the greatly increased coastal risk.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Miami and Manhattan probably won\u2019t be completely underwater in 50 years, but it may become too expensive for many to live there due to increased property insurance costs.\n\nStein was on the mark when she said warmer air, which can hold more water, has the potential to bring about more extreme weather events, such as the one in Louisiana.\n\nBut her claim that global warming would cause sea levels to rise on average \u201cnot one yard but many yards\u201d in as soon as 50 years is \u201can example of a greatly exaggerated version of reality that has a kernel of truth to it,\u201d Mann told us.\n\nCurrent scientific consensus puts the likely global mean sea level rise at a maximum 1.33 yards above current levels by 2100. And for Manhattan, Florida and Bangladesh in particular, issues go above and beyond sea level rise.", "lang": "en"}
