We reached out to Peter Sokolowski, editor at large at Merriam-Webster, who said the assertion \u201cis entirely untrue.\u201d\n\nThe assertion likely originated from Mitchum\u2019s recommendation that the editors at Merriam-Webster include language about systemic racism. The dictionary entry for racism currently has three definitions, the first two of which already call attention to individual belief and systemic biases:\n\nFrontPage Magazine, a far-right publication, argued that the new definition\u2019s emphasis on systemic racism would ignore the racism of Black people like activist Louis Farrakhan (the Southern Poverty Law Center has described Farrakhan\u2019s rhetoric as racist). The magazine said:\n\nBut their reporting failed to mention that Merriam-Webster was not planning to eliminate or replace the first definition, which focuses on individual racism. Sokolowski told Snopes that both definitions of racism \u2014 individual beliefs and the structural or institutional consequences of those individual beliefs \u2014 are already in the dictionary. They planned to simply clarify and contemporize the wording in the second definition.\n\nThe following example illustrates the distinctions between the notion of individual versus systemic racism in the dictionary entry. Civil rights activists Stokely Carmichael and Charles V. Hamilton explained the difference in their 1967 book \u201cBlack Power: The Politics of Liberation\u201d:\n\nWhen a black family moves into a home in a white neighborhood and is stoned, burned or routed out, they are victims of an overt act of individual racism which most people will condemn. But it is institutional racism that keeps black people locked in dilapidated slum tenements, subject to the daily prey of exploitative slumlords, merchants, loan sharks and discriminatory real estate agents. The society either pretends it does not know of this latter situation, or is in fact incapable of doing anything meaningful about it.\n\nMitchum found this distinction lacking in conversations with white people who cited the first definition of the Merriam-Webster entry to deny their individual role in perpetuating racism but ignored the second. She emailed editors at Merriam-Webster in late May, arguing that the dictionary definition should be updated to reflect micro-aggressions and systemic racism.\n\nThe editors agreed that the entry, which had not been changed in decades, needed a revision. They planned to expand the second definition of the entry, and sharpen its language to include explicit and implicit biases that contribute to racial discrimination. The role of systemic or institutional bias would be made clearer using examples like apartheid in South Africa.\n\nFinally, he argued that a dictionary could not capture everything about a word:\n\nUltimately, Merriam-Webster was not planning to remove the definition of individual racism or add too much new information. Editors were simply expanding the second definition of their entry to make it clearer and in line with modern usage. We thus label the claim that the revision was being made to show only white people are racist as \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
