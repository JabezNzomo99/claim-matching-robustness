Among the 30 speakers that the agenda listed were experts in fields ranging from marketing to advertisement and media to civic activism.\n\nChisinau is the third capital to host the forum, after Yerevan in 2018 and Tbilisi in 2019.\n\nIn his Sputnik Moldova report, Isayev focused on the claim that events at the forum were held in strict secrecy and that the speakers, instead of their announced topics, \u201cshared their experience in forcing regime change in their countries and fighting \u2018Russian influence\u2019.\u201d\n\nIndeed, officially, the organizers did not disclose the venue of the forum publicly, inviting participants personally, through correspondence in social networks. And there are no geotags on those few photos available on Facebook and Instagram with the hashtag #CampCamp2019.\n\nAs for the content, there was nothing about regime change or instructions for coups. The official schedule included such topics as the use of data from opinion polls, negotiations with authorities, crowdfunding, PR events for civic activism, as well as numerous workshops for the production of media products.\n\nVideo shared on social media by a forum participant shows Christina Vazovski, a native of St. Petersburg who is now the director of an art gallery in London, explaining how to create a podcast.\n\nOne forum participant told Polygraph.info that she attended all four days of the event, during which participants were taught how to do presentations, podcasts and video blogs.The participant, a Russian journalist, asked not to be identified. Polygraph.info sought comments from forum organizers, including Arthur Gureu and Maria Sereda. Gureu said he would not comment on something published by Sputnik, and Sereda had not responded to the request by the time of this publication.\n\nIn his Sputnik Moldova piece, Alexander Isayev underlined the fact that the organizer of the forum, the Prague Civil Society Center (PCSC) has received financial aid from the U.S. State Department under the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) \u2013 a law adopted in August 2017 that imposed new sanctions against Iran, Russia and North Korea.\n\nThe \u201cAbout\u201d section on the Prague Civil Society Center\u2019s website states that it is working with civil society in 12 countries, and it lists donors that include the Oak Foundation, the Council of Europe, the governments of Sweden, the Czech Republic, the U.S., UK, and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Prague Civil Society Center\u2019s CEO is \u0160imon P\u00e1nek, who also leads People in Need, a Prague-based NGO, and was one of the activists of the 1989 Velvet Revolution Czechoslovakia that led to the fall of the Communist regime in that country.\n\nWas there any anti-Russian propaganda?\n\nIn wrapping up his report for Sputnik Moldova, Isayev concluded that \u201cseemingly apolitical lectures on fundraising and design\u201d appeared to be \u201cdecorative wrapping\u201d in a program that was in fact \u201cpacked to the gills with lectures on the fight against \u2018Russian propaganda\u2019 and \u2018Russian influence\u2019, and on the organization of, and media support for, mass protests.\u201d The main \u201cpropagandists\u201d at the event Isayev said, were the Radio Free Europe Ukrainian service reporter Vlad Krilevsky, the journalist and poet Lina Goralik, and the aforementioned London art gallery director Christina Vazovski.\n\nVazovski delivered a lecture titled \u201cThe Millennials Invented TV and Radio.\u201d Goralik spoke about the \u201cBenefits and Dangers of Femvertising \u2013 Advertisement in Support of Women.\u201d\n\nIn an e-mail response to questions asked of RFE/RL, Krilevsky told Polyraph.info he was on stage three times during the forum. During a presentation on social media videos, Krilevsky said that he \u201cmentioned\u201d protests in Georgia because the previous speaker had talked about it.\n\n\u201cApart from that I didn\u2019t say a word about protests, Russia, fighting Russian authorities, etc,\u201d Krilevsky wrote. In a \u201cmasterclass\u201d on filming and editing, Vazovski added: \u201cI didn\u2019t say a word about \u2018social videos as powerful tools for fighting authorities\u201d or anything similar.\u201d\n\nKrilevsky says the \u201csocial activism\u201d at #CampCamp2019 involved \u201chuman rights, gender equality, communication\u201d and not propaganda.\n\n[Update: We updated this fact check with information confirming civil activists were among the participants. The update includes comments from the RFE/RL reporter Vlad Krilevsky who Sputnik Moldova called one of the main \u201cpropagandists.\u201d Krilevsky denied he discussed issues involving Russian disinformation and propaganda].\n\nThis article is written by a Moldovan journalist Elena DERJANSCHI who is on a fellowship at the Polygraph.info, Voice of America\u2019s fact-checking unit.", "lang": "en"}
