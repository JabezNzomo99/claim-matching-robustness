The French fact checker further said that the bat soup in the woman\u2019s video looked like it was from Palau, where it is a delicacy.\n\nThough some of the photos showing wild animals sold as street food were really from China, the photo of rats was taken at the market of Canh Nau village, west of Hanoi; the chopped snakes photo was taken in Cambodia, and the image of axolotls came from Japan.\n\nMoreover, as of Friday, March 13, there are still not enough studies available that confirm the source of the 2019 novel coronavirus. There are available studies that suggest bats, snakes, and/or pangolins are potential hosts of the virus, but further research is needed to confirm this. The manner that the virus is transmitted to humans is also still unknown.\n\n\u201cCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats, while MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed,\u201d WHO said in their FAQs.", "lang": "en"}
