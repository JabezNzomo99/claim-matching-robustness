According to the captions shared with the photos, the ivory was dyed pink to make it worthless and protect the animals from poachers. This is false; the images were doctored and though a test was conducted where ivory was dyed for similar reasons, it was colorless to the human eye.\n\nDying elephants and rhinos\u2019 tusks and horns pink does not prevent poaching. The idea that it does is very popular on the internet, as several petitions and social media publications in multiple languages show. This Facebook post alone has more than 5,300 shares and explains that pink dye \u201cmakes the Ivory unsellable and it can\u2019t be consumed. (the animals are not harmed and it is saving their lives)\u201d\n\nThis theory has been called the \u201cpink tusk theory\u201d in the United States. Unfortunately it is only a theory and does not work in practice.\n\nSeveral elements makes the dying of tusks and horns an unrealistic solution. This article on the website of the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) explains the logistical difficulties of attempting to dye the tusks of a population of 400,000 elephants.\n\nIn addition to requiring monumental financial resources, it would require the capture and sedation of the animals, which could put their health at risk.\n\n\u201cThe perturbations and stress could cause harm on individuals as well as families, the number of animals that could succumb to the procedure has a good chance to be high\u201d wrote Rikkert Reijnen, director of the program against wildlife crime at IFAW.\n\nMoreover tusks grow constantly, which would require a regular repetition of the operation. \u201cEven if it was doable, nothing guaranties that the pink ivory would not become the next trendy product\u201d adds Rikkert Reijnen.\n\nSt\u00e9phane Ringuet, in charge of the fight against trade of endangered species at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), agrees. \u201cIt seems illusory to me to imagine that dying elephants\u2019 tusks could have an impact on the behavior of poachers. Personally I don\u2019t believe it for a second\u201d he explained to AFP. He confirmed all the elements brought up by IFAW and added that \u201cpink is very easily seen in nature, which would attract the attention of anyone, poachers included\u201d.\n\nFor Ringuet, \u201cThis should not distract us from other actions that are more important in the fight against poaching, illegal trade or reducing the demand (for ivory).\u201d\n\nTo fight against poaching, the WWF focuses primarily on education in order to reduce the demand for these products.\n\nThe inspiration for the pink dye story is an initiative by the Rhino Rescue Project, an animal protection association that developed a substance which made rhinos\u2019 horns toxic for human consumption. It was created in the hope of dissuading poachers.\n\nTested in a South African protected park, a side effect of this substance gave horns a neon pink tint when they passed through airport X-ray machines, as shown in this AFP video.\n\nHowever this pink shade could be seen by the naked eye, as this photo of a rhino after treatment from the Rhino Rescue Project shows.\n\nThis was all that was needed for the rumor to spread. Although elephants were never part of the initiative, Earth\u2019s largest land mammal became part of the story.\n\nThe WWF estimates that at least 20,000 elephants are killed each year for their ivory.\n\nIn the original picture, the elephant\u2019s tusks are not pink, as can be seen in this video from 2011 :\n\nSimilarly, the rhino\u2019s photo has been digitally altered. The original photo is available in various online image banks. It was taken by photographer Heinrich Van Den Berg.", "lang": "en"}
