Development Program, said women \u201cprovide 66 percent of the work, produce 50 percent of the food, but earn only 10 percent of the income and own 1 percent of the property.\u201d But this factoid, frequently circulated around International Women\u2019s Day, is based on fishy research from more than four decades ago. The numbers were never correct in the first place and thus earned Four Pinocchios. Oxfam and the UNDP conceded that the information was false, but The Fact Checker called on them to prominently correct all documents and Web sites that had previously run this material so this zombie fact can finally be terminated.\n\nEurope: Is the share of women in political decision-making roles less than 20 percent?\n\nFederica Mogherini is the closest the European Union has to a foreign minister. In a video message to a gathering in Santiago de Chile, she decried the slow progress made in increasing female representation in politics. The picture is slightly less bleak than the one indicated by Mogherini. Women represented 22.1 percent of all parliamentarians as of Jan. 1, 2015, according to data by the Inter-Parliamentary Union. She is more precise on the share of ministers (17 percent worldwide) but a little fuzzier in terms of women in political decision-making roles in the E.U. In fact, women are 37 percent of all members of the European Parliament, but only 32 percent of the commissioners, 28 percent of members of national parliaments and the same share of government ministers across the E.U. 28. Her statement is imprecise but not incorrect: \u201cAlmost.\u201d\n\nU.S.: How is ISIS recruiting women?\n\nCNN showed its audience a graphic that said, \u201cISIS LURES WOMEN WITH KITTENS, NUTELLA.\u201d ISIS supporters create and promote propaganda messages that are more slickly produced and reach wider audiences than efforts from other terrorist groups. But to say they use kittens and Nutella to target women is incomplete and misleading. ISIS uses many tactics to persuade people to give up their lives for their fight, experts said. The real motivations for someone joining the fight run much deeper and are connected to the pursuit of identity and purpose. To boil down ISIS\u2019 recruitment strategy of women to Nutella and kittens is a vast oversimplification that borders on the absurd. There is a shred of truth to this claim but not much beyond that. We rate it Mostly False.\n\nTurkey: How much did women\u2019s participation in the workforce increase?\n\nMinister of Interior Efkan Ala claimed that the rate of women\u2019s participation in labor force have increased to 45 percent, whereas it was below 10 percent 10 years ago. In order to fact-check this statement we refer to the data provided by Turkish Statistical Institute. According to the most recent data provided by the institute in September 2014, the rate of female participation in labor force is around 31.1 percent. In 2004 this rate was 23.3 percent. In other words, the actual increase in female participation in labor force in the last 10 years is 7.8 percent. Hence we conclude that Ala\u2019s claim is false.\n\nThe new health minister, Daniel Goll\u00e1n, referred to the need to reduce the maternal mortality rate, and he pointed out that illegal abortions are part of the problem. Abortions conducted in insecure conditions are in fact the first cause of maternal death; they represented around 20 percent of the 245 deaths related to pregnancy in 2013. Argentina committed to the U.N. Millennium Development Goals, which include cutting by 75 percent the maternal mortality rate by 2015, compared to 1990, but the country is still far from reaching it. In Argentina, abortion is only legal in the case of rape or if the mother\u2019s life is in danger. The statement is true.\n\nPresident Michelle Bachelet, using a WHO study from 2013, claimed that \u201cone third of women in the world suffer some kind of physical or sexual violence.\u201d But this is not true enough. The research is founded on databases from two territories of 79 countries instead of national samples. Also, the information considers violence against women of 15 to 49 years of age and use questionnaires which are not always comparable. Although the WHO report talks about the fact that one out of three women have suffered violence, it focuses on prevalence of violence in a lifetime, so it is important to note that it is not the same to say that one third of women \u201chave experienced\u201d once-in-a-lifetime violence, than to \u201cexperience\u201d violence now or in the recent past, like experts explain. The statement is \u201cHalf True.\u201d\n\nItaly: Is the homicide rate falling for men but not women?\n\nLaura Boldrini is the president of the Italian Chamber of Deputies and frequently comments on gender-related issues. In Italy, the homicide rate for men is nearly twice as high as that for women: 1.1 per 100 000 men vs. 0.58 per 100,000 women. That said, the homicide rates for men has fallen significantly since the 1990s (it was at or above 4 per 100,000 people 20 years ago), while it has remained essentially unchanged for women. The statement is true.\n\nUruguay: Are there a record number of women in government?\n\nDuring the Frente Amplio governments, the two pasts and the one recently elected, the political spaces for women has been much more open than in any other time in Uruguay. When V\u00e1zquez assumed for the first time (in 2005), three women were designated as part of the Cabinet. Last March 1, with the assumption of the second presidency of V\u00e1zquez, and the third of his party, five women were named as ministers. So the claim is true.\n\n Read the full fact-check (in Spanish) here.\n\nBrazil: \u2018Safe homes\u2019 for women in every state?\n\nBrazilian President Dilma Rousseff made this claim at the seminar \u201cWomen in Power and Decision Making: Building a Different World,\u201d hosted in Chile, on March 1. The \u201cHouse of the Brazilian Women,\u201d which provides support, assistance and protection to women that are victims of violence, has already established agreements with 26 state capitals. The only Brazilian capital that is not part of the initiative is the city of Recife, in Pernambuco. However the only \u201cHouse of Brazilian Women\u201d opened until this moment is located in Mato Grosso do Sul. Our verdict is: \u201ctoo early to tell.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
