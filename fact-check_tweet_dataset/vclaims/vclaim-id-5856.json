But this comparison is misleading and fails to consider why responses to TB have differed around the world.\n\nThe post reads: \u201c10 Million People contracted Tuberculosis last year. 1.5 Million People DIED. Did you even know? Were you scared for your life? Did we wear masks, close the economy, cancel schools, and ruin small businesses? No. Why? Because the media didn\u2019t tell you to be AFRAID!\u201d (here).\n\nThe post presents accurate statistics about the prevalence of TB, which stands as the leading infectious cause of death worldwide (here).\n\nHowever, it does not consider the differences between the transmission and geographical distribution of COVID-19 and TB, and how these differences influence what measures are used to tackle the diseases.\n\nIn terms of transmission, tuberculosis is caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis. It most often affects the lungs, and like COVID-19 can spread from person to person through the air (here).\n\nThere are two TB related conditions \u2013 latent TB infection and TB disease (here). When exposed to TB, a person can either develop TB disease with symptoms such as a cough, fever or weight loss, or become infected but not have any symptoms (latent TB infections). Those with latent TB infections can go on to develop TB disease at a later point.\n\nDr Tom Wingfield, Senior Clinical Lecturer and Honorary Consultant Physician at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, points to this \u2018dormant\u2019 form of tuberculosis as a feature that makes it distinct from COVID-19.\n\n\u201cTB infection / disease normally occurs over a long time period and perhaps longer person-to-person exposure, whereas COVID-19 can transmit from short periods of exposure and develops symptoms usually within about five days,\u201d he explained to Reuters via email.\n\n\u201cIndeed, COVID-19 doesn\u2019t have a \u2018latent infection\u2019 phase like TB\u201d, he added, with the caveat that TB can sometimes be transmitted from minimal exposure, \u201cso this is not a water-tight rule\u201d.\n\nOn top of this, the post on social media does not consider that differences in the geographical distribution of the two diseases influences where preventative measures are enforced.\n\nFor instance, it would be unlikely that a widescale lockdown for tuberculosis would be implemented in the United States. In 2019, the country provisionally recorded 8,920 cases of TB, out of 10 million globally (here).\n\nThat compares with more 5 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. so far, with more than 168,000 deaths (here).\n\nFurthermore, unlike COVID-19, which threatened to overwhelm healthcare systems if widespread lockdowns were not implemented, there does not seem to be evidence that this would have happened because of TB.\n\nGlobally, there are areas of the world where TB remains a threat. In 2018, eight countries including India, China and Indonesia accounted for two thirds of new TB cases (here).\n\nIn areas where tuberculosis is prevalent, Wingfield said that measures like mask-wearing and social distancing can be used to help reduce the spread of the disease.\n\nThere is also a vaccination that reduces the likelihood of children contracting severe TB symptoms, although it doesn't protect adults (tinyurl.com/y6drzzka).\n\nIn some cases, workplaces or schools can be temporarily shut down while dealing with an outbreak, but Wingfield explained that \u201cthis is more likely to happen in high-income settings that have the resources to do this as opposed to low-income settings where TB is more prevalent.\u201d\n\nOne issue with lockdown measures that are implemented nationally, Wingfield notes, is the concern that they will cause people to lose income and have reduced funds to buy nutritional food.\n\nUndernutrition increases the risk of TB, and according to the World Health Organization (WHO) causes around one quarter of all new TB cases globally (here).\n\nUltimately though, the post points to a lack of global awareness about TB which Wingfield alleged is due to the majority of TB cases being among poorer people living in low- and middle-income countries.\n\n\u201cOften, such communities have limited agency or advocacy to raise the disease up the national and international policy agenda,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf, like COVID-19, TB affected people in such numbers in high-income settings then it is highly likely people would be more aware and, to be frank, more would be done to address it\u201d.\n\nMisleading. Although the post presents accurate statistics about the prevalence of TB, it does not examine the key differences in transmission and geographical distribution between TB and COVID-19.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
