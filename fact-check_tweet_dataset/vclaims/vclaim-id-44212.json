One user posted the claim through a photo, which contained the text: \"Panibagong problema ngayong COVID-19. Pag nakagat, patay! Mga insekto sumalakay (A new problem during COVID-19. Once bitten, you're dead! Insects attacked).\"\n\nIt appeared to be a screenshot of a YouTube video, with the title, \"Flying insects killing people in China, India, and Iran (deadly insects).\" The thumbnail contained 3 photos, with two of these depicting people lying on the ground, and one showing a man carrying a child.\n\nThe facts: The photos attached in this claim were taken from footage of a gas leak in India. They are not connected to reported incidents of insect swarms.\n\nLocust swarms destroyed nearly 50,000 hectares of crops in India as of May 27. But according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, locusts do not attack people or animals.\n\nMeanwhile, hornets have killed dozens of people in China, but this was in October 2013 and not in the time of the coronavirus as the claim says. However, these hornets were spotted in the United States in May.\n\nThe photos used in the claim did not depict the impact of an insect infestation, but rather, it showed the aftermath of a gas leak in India. The first photo was taken from footage of the gas leak that occurred in Visakhapatnam, India, on May 7.\n\nThe video had the caption: \"At least eight people, including a minor, were reported dead due to a major gas leak at an LG Polymer industry in the RR Venkatapuram village in Andhra Pradesh's Visakhapatnam, in the early hours of Thursday, May 7.\"\n\nThe second photo was taken from a video of the same incident, uploaded by BBC World Service on May 7, with the title: \"India chemical plant disaster.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the third photo was from the same gas leak, uploaded by India Today on the same date. The video was entitled: \"Vizag Gas Leak Tragedy: Toxic Gas Leak at Visakhapatnam Chemical Plant Leaves Hundreds Hospitalised.\"\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
