Gulf News, a daily from Abu Dabhi, has published Rahul Gandhi\u2019s image as \u2018Pappu\u2019. -translated)\u201d\n\nAn image of a caricature supposedly published by Gulf News with the aforementioned text is doing the rounds on social media. In the newspaper clip of January 9, a caricature of the Congress president is visible with the text, \u201cHOW \u2018PAPPU\u2019 LABEL\u201d. Former state executive member of BJP communication cell Amit Patel tweeted an image of the newspaper clip suggesting that Gulf News has published a photo of Rahul Gandhi calling him a \u2018Pappu\u2018. Patel is followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Twitter. Another handle, @ManishKBJP who is also followed by PM Modi has tweeted the image with an identical narrative.\n\nPostcard News founder Mahesh Vikram Hedge and Gaurav Pradhan , who are also followed by PM Modi, tweeted the image with misleading claims.\n\nSeveral individuals on Facebook and Twitter have shared this image with an identical narrative.\n\nWe accessed the PDF version of the Gulf News newspaper,a Dubai based English daily, published on January 9. The narrative that Gulf News was mocking Rahul Gandhi with a caricature and calling him \u2018Pappu\u2019 is false. The caption affixed with the caricature reads, \u201cHOW PAPPU LABEL HAS CHANGED RAHUL\u201d.\n\nThe caricature signed by Rahul Gandhi was published along with an exclusive interview given to the newspaper.\n\nIn an interview with UAE editor Bobby Naqvi, Rahul Gandhi spoke on issues ranging from job creation, economy and nationalism. Naqvi had asked a question to Gandhi on the latter being labelled \u2018Pappu\u2019 by his detractors.\n\nNaqvi: Does the \u2018Pappu\u2019 label bother you?\n\nGandhi: \u201cThe best gift that I have received was 2014. I have learnt from it like I couldn\u2019t have learnt from anything else. The more difficult my opponents make my life, the harder it is for me , the better it is for me. I don\u2019t get disturbed by this [Pappu]. I appreciate attacks from opponents and I learn from them.\u201d\n\nAlt News contacted Bobby Naqvi regarding the misleading claims viral on social media. Rubbishing the claims, Naqvi said, \u201cThese tweets, as we know, are intended to spread falsehood and spin issues. It is incorrect to say that Gulf News used this label to describe the Congress President.\u201d Moreover, Naqvi further explained the reason for his question on the label saying, \u201cThe question was asked because this label has been used in the last five years to build a particular image of Rahul Gandhi by his detractors and as a journalist I asked him to get his thoughts.\u201d\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Gulf News called Rahul Gandhi \u2018Pappu\u2019 is false and incorrect. The interviewer was merely seeking Rahul Gandhi\u2019s viewpoint on being branded a \u2018pappu\u2019 by detractors.", "lang": "en"}
