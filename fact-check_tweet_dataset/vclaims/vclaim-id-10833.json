They give quite different estimates of the EU\u2019s share of the world economy: 16% or 22%, as of October 2017.\n\nBoth measures show that the EU\u2019s share of the world economy is declining and expected to continue doing so. One unofficial forecast estimates the EU\u2019s share (excluding the United Kingdom) could be 12% by 2030.\n\nThere are two main measures of GDP\n\nOne way is to look at the value of a country\u2019s economic output (GDP), and see what it\u2019s worth in US dollars (USD).\n\nUsing market exchange rates has the advantage of being quite simple (it\u2019s like the exchange rates you use when going on holiday), but they\u2019re not consistent over time. A country\u2019s share of world GDP can move up or down quite suddenly if exchange rates change.\n\nFor instance, just because the UK sterling exchange rate fell suddenly on 24 June 2016 doesn\u2019t mean that the UK\u2019s economic output suddenly got smaller, even though it was worth less in US dollars.\n\nSo an alternative is to calculate GDP in terms of \u2018Purchasing Power Parity\u2019 (PPP).\n\nThis adjusts the figures to reflect different price levels around the world, and to account for how currency values have changed over time.\n\nThat solves the problems with the market exchange rates approach, but creates new ones too. One issue is that it involves many more assumptions and has the potential for errors.\n\nThe EU\u2019s estimated share of world GDP is currently 16% or 22%\n\nLooked at in terms of PPP, the EU\u2019s share of world GDP in 2017 is around 16%, according to figures from the IMF. This measure includes the United Kingdom in the EU. Without the UK, the EU\u2019s share would be roughly 14%.\n\nThis measure also shows that the EU\u2019s share of the world economy has been steadily declining over time. It was 30% in 1980 and is expected to be 15% by 2022.\n\nThese historic figures include all states who are members of the EU today. So for example, although Spain and Portugal only became members later in the 1980s, the EU share of world GDP figure for 1980 includes their economies, as they are members today.\n\nThe IMF also has figures based on USD. This measure puts the EU\u2019s share of world GDP at 22%.\n\nIt shows a similar trend of the EU\u2019s share declining over time \u2013 from 34% in 1980 to an expected 20% by 2022. This is not because the EU\u2019s GDP is getting smaller (it has risen consistently over time). However, the rest of the world has grown faster.\n\nIt\u2019s also likely that estimates for earlier years over-estimate the EU\u2019s share of world GDP as only 146 countries were accounted for in 1980, compared to 190 for GDP estimates and 192 for PPP estimates in 2017.\n\nEstimates to 2030 and beyond were published by accounting firm PwC earlier this year, based on its own analysis.\n\nIts estimates suggest that by 2030, the EU\u2019s share of the global economy could be around 12%, based on PPP figures. This estimate assumes that the UK will not be a part of the EU then.", "lang": "en"}
