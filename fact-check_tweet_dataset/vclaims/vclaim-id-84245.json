The claim is false; the image has been created from two Reuters photographs published in a 2008 news report about scientists in Argentina studying the impact of cow burps on global warming.\n\nThe image was shared in this Facebook post on May 17, 2019.\n\nIt has been shared around 280 times after being posted by a page with more than 16,000 followers.\n\nThe image combines two photographs showing a cow with what appears to be a large red tank on its back with text saying: \"I wish this was a joke but fringe leftists are now advocating for cow fart bags to capture farts as a way to help prevent 'global warming'.
