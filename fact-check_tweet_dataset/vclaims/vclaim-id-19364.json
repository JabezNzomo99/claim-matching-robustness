No, that's not true: quasi-identical stories to that effect have been put out by a website that is known for publishing the same death hoaxes and false stories over and over again but with different people as their subject and set in different locations.\n\nThe Boris Johnson story originated from an article published by CBTV on August 4, 2019 titled \"BREAKING NEWS: Boris Johnson loses two daughters to Texas Walmart shooting - El Paso News\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe Sri Lanka version of the hoax (archived here) was published shortly later:\n\nTwo daughters of President of Sri Lanka Maithripala Sirisena are among victims of Saturday's shooting at El Paso, Texas, which left at least 20 people dead, El Paso Police Department has said. Other media outlets report that Dharani Sirisena and Chathurika Sirisena sustained life-threatening injuries and passed on while on admission at the hospital.\n\nNo reputable news sources made any mention of this \"news\" because it was made up but we expect more versions of the story to pop up in the future given that cbtvn.com has run several other hoaxes before that were repeated over time with different protagonists and locations. Here is a list of three recent (death) hoaxes that were being run by the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Celebrity Couple Did NOT Drown in Canada While Fishing\n\u2022 Fake News: Club NOT Shut Down For Killing Patrons And Selling Them As Meat -- Same Story Set In Multiple Cities\n\u2022 Fake News: Man Knocked Down by Vehicle in Toronto NOT Identified As Rugby Union coach Ben Ryan (or Lawrence Sichalwe or Sanath Jayasuriya or Kenneth Duremdes)\n\nThe site ususally spreads its hoaxes by spamming them into local Facebook groups using a variety of (likely hacked or sold) Facebook accounts.
