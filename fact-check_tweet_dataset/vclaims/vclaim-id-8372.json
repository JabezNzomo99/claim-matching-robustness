Also wrong.\n\nIn his weekly Cabinet report aired Jan. 5 at state radio DZRB, Andanar said:\n\nAndanar said Duterte already fulfilled four of five campaign promises: addressing criminality and drugs, fighting corruption, lowering the poverty rate and fixing the country\u2019s peace and order situation.\n\n\n\nCandidate Duterte made more than five campaign promises.\n\nOn Jan. 8, 2016, Duterte and running mate Alan Peter Cayetano \"unveiled their platform of government\" before some 5,000 people in Cebu City, according to a Senate press release.\n\nDuterte also made several other promises in his various campaign speeches and during the three pre-election presidential debates.\n\nThese include creating a bank specifically for overseas Filipino workers, distributing coco levy funds to farmers, promoting family planning to prevent overpopulation, easing Metro Manila\u2019s traffic congestion, providing free irrigation to farmers, and building new railways.\n\nThese campaign promises have been widely reported in the media: Inquirer.net compiled at least 30, Rappler identified 13 and CNN Philippines listed 10 promises.\n\nVERA Files\u2019 SONA Promise Tracker followed how Duterte fared in his promises.\n\nAndanar claiming the president already delivered on four promises is also inaccurate.\n\nDuterte on several instances said that his war on drugs and criminality will continue until the last day of his term, breaking his campaign promise of finishing it in three to six months. (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: In his own words: Duterte's drug war, so far)\n\nThe president recently sacked members of his Cabinet due to \u201cunnecessary junkets.\u201d Yet members of the anti-corruption commission he created in haste last October 2017 were only appointed on Jan. 12.

The president said an extension would help law enforcement agencies \u201cquell completely and put an end to the on-going rebellion in Mindanao and prevent the same from escalating to other parts of the country.\u201d\n\nIn November, he terminated peace talks with the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People\u2019s Army-National Democratic Front- and in December declared the group a terrorist organization.\n\nSenate of the Philippines, Duterte-Cayetano launch platform and nationwide listening tour, January 8, 2016\n\nCNN Philippines, Did Duterte keep or break his promises?,.
