California-based Tesla Motors has been waging a long battle, state by state, in an effort to get the laws changed. (Here\u2019s a map that shows what states allow and prohibit direct sales.)\n\nThe Fact Checker obviously takes no position on the issue but we are interested in the facts. How accurate is it that cars in Brazil are sold directly to consumers?\n\nThe paper was issued in 2009 as part of a Justice Department series known as the Economic Analysis Group Consumer Advocacy Papers, which are infrequently published. They are intended to stimulate discussion but do not really have a Justice Department imprimatur. \u201cThe analysis and conclusions expressed in the papers are solely those of the authors and do not represent the views of the Department of Justice,\u201d the Justice Department Web site notes.\n\nBodisch, an economist who stopped working at Justice in 2011 and is now a consultant, notes on his Linked-In page that the paper \u201cis a primary reference in the debate in state legislatures on Tesla Motors\u2019 attempt to sell electric cars directly to consumers.\u201d\n\nThe centerpiece of the report is the example of General Motors selling the Chevrolet Celta directly to consumers, who purportedly order the car on Web and then have it delivered to them.\n\n\u201cGM built five distribution centers throughout Brazil to reduce transportation time from its assembly plant and buyers can track location of their car online on its way to delivery at a dealer of their choice,\u201d Bodisch wrote glowingly. \u201cThe Celta was designed by GM in collaboration with suppliers who deliver just-in-time pre-assembled modules to the factory. GM estimates that collaboration in design and manufacturing enabled it to use 60 percent fewer suppliers and 50 percent fewer parts than in a traditional assembly operation.\u201d\n\nBy 2006, \u201c700,000 Celtas had been produced and the car continues to be one of Brazil\u2019s best sellers,\u201d Bodisch wrote in the report, which as we noted was published in 2009. A full paragraph of the Bodisch report was reprinted in the Cato Institute report, which was published in 2014.\n\n\u201cI guess I was not aware of that at the time,\u201d Bodisch said in an interview. He said he based his information on the news reports when the Celta was first launched on the Internet in 2000, but had not researched further.\n\nThe reports were certainly enthusiastic at the start. CNET in a 2000 report said that 56 percent of the sales were made directly through the Internet and the company was considering introducing the concept to other countries. A 2001 GM news release said that 80 percent of the cars were sold over the Internet. And the \u201cMilestones 2000-2008\u201d Web page (cited in Bodisch\u2019s report) of GM\u2019s Brazil subsidiary, GM do Brasil, shows 700,000 Celtas were produced by May 2006.\n\n\u201cWe ran the Celta online sales program in Brazil from 2000 to 2006,\u201d GM spokesman Patrick E. Morrissey said. \u201cUnder this program, Chevrolet in Brazil sold approximately 100,000 units per year.\u201d But he said that \u201cthe online sales model no longer made sense for customers,\u201d for a variety of reasons, including \u201cfederal and state tax changes in the country\u201d and \u201cthe infrastructure costs to maintain distribution centers.\u201d\n\nThis is yet another good example of why people need to check their facts. It\u2019s a bit astonishing that a paper published by the Justice Department cited as a success story a product launch that had already failed three years earlier\u2014and that six years after the paper was written, the same tired story of the supposedly successful Celta Web program continues to be touted. There may be many reasons why direct cars sales are preferable, but GM\u2019s experience in Brazil is not one of them.", "lang": "en"}
