The claim is misleading; the photos have circulated in reports about a collision in India since 2019.\n\nThe photos were published on Facebook here on June 17, 2020. The post has been shared more than 1,200 times.\n\nThe Sinhala-language text alongside the photos translates to English as: \u201cCrashed into the train/ Imagine the kind of pain it must be going through/ Let\u2019s wish for a speedy recovery\u201d.\n\nThe post circulated as Sri Lanka continues to debate the issue of elephants being killed or injured by trains.\n\nSeveral comments on the post showed that other Facebook users believed the incident occurred in Sri Lanka. One user, for example, wrote: \u201cGood for nothing governments. Still no solution to these issues here\u201d.\n\nAnother commenter wrote: \u201cInjuries to elephants, this is a grave issue here. A prompt solution is needed because animals too need to live in this world, not just humans\u2026.If the train is damaged this bad because of a collision into an elephant, the safety of the passengers is 0, Indian fiber trash...\u201d\n\nThe two photos were also shared alongside a similar claim in 2019 on Facebook here and here.\n\nThe claim, however, is misleading.\n\nReverse Google image searches of the photos found that they have in fact circulated in reports about an incident in India since 2019.\n\nThe photos were published here on an online forum that hosts discussion about railways in India. According to the blog, the collision between the train and elephant in the photos occurred on a railway between the notheastern cities of Siliguri and Dhubri.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the images in the forum (L) and the images in the misleading post (R):\n\nThe collision between the elephant and the train was also reported on in this article by India Today, an Indian news magazine.\n\nThe report, published on September 27, 2019, is titled: \u201cTrain hits and critically injures elephant in North Bengal. Devastating video goes viral\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe engine of the train hit an elephant that was trying to cross the tracks in the jungle. The hit left the animal severely injured, and a video of the accident has made it to social media,\u201d the article reads.\n\nThe specific train route, India Today\u2019s report added, runs through \u201cseveral elephant corridors\u201d and is \u201cnotorious for elephant deaths\u201d.\n\nA notice about the collision was also posted on the official Facebook page of the NorthEast Frontier Railway on September 28, 2019.", "lang": "en"}
