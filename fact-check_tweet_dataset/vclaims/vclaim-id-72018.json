Tom Cotton of Arkansas is challenging incumbent Democrat Sen. Mark Pryor, in a tight race that could decide which party controls the Senate. Like many other Republicans facing against incumbent Democrats, Cotton often attacks Pryor for voting in line with Obama\u2019s policies more often than not.\n\nIn the candidates\u2019 first , Cotton said, \"Sen. Pryor has said that President Obama doesn\u2019t have a lot to offer rural America and states like Arkansas. I agree. I just don\u2019t understand why he votes with him 93 percent of the time.\"\n\nCotton has made this claim and ones like it a lot throughout the campaign, while Pryor has touted a supposedly independent record. National Journal\u2019s landed Pryor right in the middle of the Senate, at 53rd most-liberal and 47th most-conservative.\n\nWe decided to check out how often Pryor votes in line with Obama.\n\nWe reached out to Cotton\u2019s campaign, and they didn\u2019t get back to us. But these statistics typically come from CQ Roll Call, which tracks congressional data. Since 1953, when Dwight D. Eisenhower became president, CQ has calculated presidential support in congressional votes.\n\nIn its , CQ editors select \"presidential support votes,\" based on clear statements the president or his spokespersons make on particular votes. Members\u2019 presidential support scores reflect how often they vote in agreement with the president\u2019s position.\n\nHere\u2019s Pryor\u2019s presidential support rate since 2009, when Obama took office.\n\nPryor's votes have lined up with Obama's stated position on that vote between 90 and 95 percent of the time for the past five years. Cotton\u2019s figure -- 93 percent -- is right smack in the middle. (The average is 92.6 percent.) So it\u2019s pretty accurate.\n\nIn 2013, Pryor supported the president the least among Senate Democrats, according to CQ. That year, Senate Democrats overall voted with Obama 96 percent of the time in 2013, which was the \"highest level of support given to the commander in chief from either party in at least six decades,\" according to CQ.\n\nIt\u2019s reasonable to assume that this measurement would also indicate how a member of Congress votes with their party -- given the partisan environment. But this is not strictly the case. Here\u2019s Pryor\u2019s voting record in terms of how often he voted with the Democratic Party since 2009.\n\nAlthough he has voted with Obama at least 90 percent of the time, Pryor has voted with the Democratic Party less often, particularly in the past year.\n\nFor contrast, Cotton -- who has only been in office as a representative for one year -- voted with Obama just 12 percent of the time in 2013. He voted with the Republican Party 97 percent of the time.\n\nThe CQ number is straight roll call votes, so it doesn\u2019t count other ways a member of Congress might have acted against the president\u2019s agenda, such as sponsoring legislation that never makes it to a vote.\n\nPryor\u2019s campaign pointed to his that would have preserved future Social Security benefits -- Obama called for changes in his budget request. Obama\u2019s proposal was seen as an hoping for austerity measures.\n\nThe campaign also noted that because CQ doesn\u2019t weigh the votes, it might not reflect that Pryor voted against Obama on key legislation. They noted the of a gun control bill involving universal background checks, which Obama supported. Pryor was one of five Democrats to oppose the bill.\n\nCotton said Pryor \"votes with Obama 93 percent of the time.\"\n\nSince Obama became president, Pryor has voted in line with the president\u2019s positions between 90 and 95 percent of the time, with 92.6 percent -- basically 93 percent -- as the average, according to the best rating system at our disposal. Pryor doesn\u2019t vote with the Democratic Party quite as often, though, and in 2013 his presidential support votes were lower than every other Senate Democrat.\n\nCotton\u2019s number is on target based on the data, but Pryor has also opposed Obama on a few key issues. We rate his claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
