The claim is misleading; the FDA, the federal agency in the US in charge of food safety, made no such announcement. In 2011, the agency did suspend certain products after \u201cvery low\u201d levels of inorganic arsenic was found in chickens, but the FDA said the meat did not pose a threat to human health.\n\nThe claim was published on Facebook here on May 13, 2020. It has been shared more than 250 times.\n\nThe post\u2019s text graphic reads: \u201cFDA finally admits 70% of chicken in the market contains cancer-causing arsenic.\n\n\u201cAfter years of sweeping the issue under the rug and hoping no one would notice, the FDA has now finally admitted that chicken meat sold in the USA contains arsenic, a cancer-causing toxic chemical that's fatal in high doses. But the real story is where this arsenic comes from: it's added to the chicken feed on purpose!\n\n\u201cEven worse, the FDA says its own research shows that the arsenic added to the chicken feed ends up in the chicken meat where it is consumed by humans. So for the last sixty years, American consumers who eat conventional chicken have been swallowing arsenic, a known cancer-causing chemical.\u201d\n\nThe post was also published on Facebook here, as well as, in Spanish here, here and here, and in French here.\n\nIn June 2011, the FDA did announce that an animal drug produced by Alpharma, a subsidiary of the American Pfizer, would be suspended because regulators found inorganic arsenic in chickens that consumed the drug.\n\nThe FDA added, however, that the arsenic levels were \u201cvery low\u201d and stressed that continuing to eat chicken while the drug is phased out of use did \u201cnot post a health risk.\u201d\n\nThe drug -- 3-Nitro, which was also known as Roxarsone -- was originally approved for use by poultry farmers in 1944.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), inorganic arsenic is highly toxic and can cause cancer and skin damage when consumed over long periods of time.\n\n\u201cPeople are exposed to elevated levels of inorganic arsenic through drinking contaminated water, using contaminated water in food preparation and irrigation of food crops, industrial processes, eating contaminated food and smoking tobacco,\u201d the agency notes.\n\nInorganic arsenic differs from naturally occuring arsenic, which is widely found in the Earth's crust, according to the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.\n\nIn a statement to AFP on July 30, 2019, an FDA spokesperson also said that \u201cthere are no longer any FDA-approved arsenic-containing products for chickens.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson added that in 2015 the agency did several follow up studies that affirmed the results of the 2011 study. The FDA published its full findings on arsenic in animal drugs and feed on its website here.", "lang": "en"}
