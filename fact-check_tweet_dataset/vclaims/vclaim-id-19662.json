The campaign says that \u201call of our merchandise is 100% made in the USA.\u201d\n\nThere are several posts on Facebook purportedly showing Chinese factory workers in China manufacturing banners for Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign. I don\u2019t want to repost unless this is true.\n\nEver since President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign rooted itself in a theme of \u201cAmerica First,\u201d critics have called attention to the businessman\u2019s own eponymous products that were being made outside the U.S. \u2014 such as Trump shirts made in Bangladesh and sports coats made in India.\n\nBut are his 2020 reelection campaign banners, or flags, being made in China? That\u2019s the question a dozen readers have asked us in recent weeks, in the midst of news coverage on the topic and subsequent criticism by Sen. Bernie Sanders, who cited one such report.\n\nSanders wrote in a Facebook post: \u201cGiven the choice between hiring American workers at a living wage or hiring much less expensive workers from China that he can exploit, Trump opts for the low-cost overseas labor day in and day out.\u201d\n\nWhile pictures, videos and interviews with factory managers show that factories in China are producing banners supporting Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, who exactly ordered those products isn\u2019t clear. The campaign rebutted the implication that it was ordering banners overseas, telling us that \u201call of our merchandise is 100% made in the USA.\u201d\n\nIn early July, however, the owner of a flag-making factory in China\u2019s Zhejiang province told the NPR podcast \u201cThe Indicator\u201d that he was filling an order for Trump reelection flags.\n\n\u201cWe also make flags for Trump for 2020. It seems like he has another campaign going on in 2020. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d Li Jiang said in the interview through an interpreter, according to the show\u2019s July 3 transcript. The host of the podcast later said Li was making \u201cthousands of blue and white Trump 2020 flags.\u201d\n\nThe podcast noted that Li\u2019s factory in 2016 made flags in support of both Trump and rival Hillary Clinton. Li also said the product labels indicate the flags are made in China.\n\nA July 25 Reuters article showed photographic and video evidence of banners being made at another Chinese factory, the Jiahao Flag Co. in the country\u2019s Anhui province. The video shows women inside the factory working on blue, white and red Trump 2020 flags that say, \u201cKeep America Great!\u201d\n\nA manager, Yao Yuanyuan, told Reuters that the factory has produced 90,000 flags since March \u2014 and she speculated that the purchaser was \u201ctaking advantage of the fact that the tariffs haven\u2019t gone up yet, with lower prices now.\u201d Amid a trade feud, the Trump administration has imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of products from China, and it has threatened additional tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.\n\nBut, Reuters reported, Yao \u201csays the buyers are located in both China and abroad and she doesn\u2019t know if they are affiliated with Trump\u2019s official campaign or the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nIn a statement responding to our questions, Michael Glassner \u2014 the chief operating officer for the campaign \u2014 said: \u201cWe have made it clear all along that all of our merchandise is 100% made in the USA. Any vendor who claims to have a relationship with us otherwise is lying or violating our protected trademark rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis applies to all of the recent fake news about Made in China products for the 2020 campaign,\u201d the statement said.\n\nWe asked the campaign if it was aware of other parties that may have ordered the flags being made in China, but we did not get a response.\n\nThe Trump reelection campaign\u2019s spending records filed with the Federal Election Commission, as of June 30, show the campaign paid $1,524 for \u201cflags\u201d in June to Wisconsin-based Medalcraft Mint, though it\u2019s unlikely that purchase was actually for flags. Medalcraft\u2019s website doesn\u2019t advertise such products, and a representative told FactCheck.org by phone that the company doesn\u2019t make flags. The company made the official inaugural medal for Trump \u2014 which it had done for the prior two presidents as well, according to its website.\n\nA search of the campaign\u2019s reports for \u201ccollateral\u201d shows many other payments for products such as T-shirts, mugs and hats \u2014 but none to the Chinese factories in question. Many purchases are from Ace Specialties in Louisiana and Cali-Fame in California.\n\nDonald J. Trump for President, Inc. \u2013 Committee overview. U.S. Federal Election Commission.
