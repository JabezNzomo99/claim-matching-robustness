EO 201 granted a salary increase in four tranches from 2016 to 2019 for officials and employees of the national government, including the president.\n\nWhile Duterte also increased the salaries in government, including that of the president, for 2020 to 2023 by enacting RA 11466 in January 2020, he is prohibited by law from benefiting from it. The 1987 Constitution exempts the incumbent president, vice president, and members of Congress from salary increases granted during their tenure.\n\nUnder RA 11466, the president after Duterte will receive a salary of P395,858 to P431,718 a month, plus allowances and other perks that come with the position.\n\nDuterte\u2019s complaint regarding his salary came in the course of his discussion about the alleged anomalies at the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth) and how the government has been responding to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\nAt one point, he asked Filipinos to \u201cwalk the extra mile to help our country.\u201d\n\nThe president said government funds are already depleted and he could no longer provide for subsidies so the economy has to be opened up even partially and people have to go back to work.\n\u2022 VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Duterte\u2019s claim about his salary still inaccurate\n\u2022 VERA FILES FACT CHECK: How much does President Duterte earn monthly?\n\nRTVMalacanang Meeting on COVID-19 Concerns and Talk to the People on COVID-19 8/10/2020, Aug. 10, 2020\n\nDepartment of Budget and Management, DISTRIBUTION OF PERMANENT POSITIONS IN THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT PLANTILLA BY SALARY GRADE FOR FY 2020\n\nDepartment of Budget and Management, National Budget Circular No. 562, Series of 2016, Feb. 24, 2016\n\nDepartment of Budget and Management, National Budget Circular No. 568, Jan.5, 2017\n\nDepartment of Budget and Management, National Budger Circular No. 572, Jan. 3, 2018\n\nDepartment of Budget and Management, National Budget Circular No. 575 Jan. 15, 2019\n\u2022 RTVMalacanang, Visit to the New Hope Village Housing Project (Speech) 1/25/2017, Jan. 25. 2017\n\u2022 Presidential Communications Operations Office, President Rody Duterte departs the Davao International Airport for a State Visit to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Feb. 22, 2017\n\u2022 RTVMalacanang, Establishment of TienDA Para Sa Mga Bayani and Talk to the Troops (Speech) 2/22/2018, April 2017", "lang": "en"}
