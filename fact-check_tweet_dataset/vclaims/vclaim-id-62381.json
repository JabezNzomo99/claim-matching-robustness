Two months earlier, the president had mused about the beneficial effects of injecting disinfectants into the body to combat COVID-19. After many health officials expressed their dismay, Trump repeatedly claimed that he was just being sarcastic.\n\nThat same month, after he misspelled \u201cNobel Prize\u201d in a tweet \u2013 writing it out as \u201cNoble Prize\u201d \u2013 he deleted the tweet before falling back on on a familiar excuse: sarcasm.\n\nWhat is it about sarcasm that makes it such a convenient excuse for people who are trying to distance themselves from what they\u2019ve said?\n\nAs I describe in my recent book on irony and sarcasm, most cognitive scientists and other language researchers think of sarcasm as a form of verbal irony. Both ways of speaking involve saying the opposite of what you mean. But the goals of irony and sarcasm are actually different.\n\nFor example, if someone slowly intones \u201cWhat beautiful weather!\u201d on a cold and rainy day, it\u2019s clear they\u2019re speaking ironically about a disappointing state of affairs. In general, irony is used to provide commentary on unexpected and negative outcomes.\n\nSarcasm, on the other hand, is most frequently used to disparage the actions of other people. If someone tells you that you\u2019re a real genius after you forgot to meet them for an important appointment, they clearly don\u2019t mean that you\u2019re mentally gifted. Simply put, irony is commentary, but sarcasm is criticism.\n\nThat seems straightforward enough. But in actual practice, the line between irony and sarcasm is blurry and confusing. Many people assert they are being sarcastic when they are in fact being ironic, as in the previous example of the weather.\n\nThe enlargement of the domain of sarcasm \u2013 at irony\u2019s expense \u2013 is a linguistic shift that has been going on for some time. In fact, linguist Geoffrey Nunberg called attention to this phenomenon 20 years ago. So it\u2019s hard to fault the president for conflating the two.\n\nAnother element that makes sarcasm tricky to grasp has to do with saying the opposite of what is meant. The recipient of such a statement isn\u2019t supposed to take it literally.\n\nFor this reason, when we use verbal irony or sarcasm, we might employ cues to signal our nonliteral intent. We may, for example, speak in a tone of voice that\u2019s slower, lower and louder than how we speak normally. Our pitch may swoop up or down. Ironic statements are also frequently accompanied by facial displays, such as a smirk or the rolling of the eyes.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why, when being sarcastic over text or email, we\u2019ll use emojis to relay nonliteral intent. Of course, even then, there\u2019s no guarantee that the recipient will interpret the message correctly.\n\nPresident Trump does, at times, clearly make use of sarcasm. For example, at a December 2019 rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania, he said, referring to the House\u2019s imminent decision to initiate impeachment proceedings, that the Democrats \u201calso understand poll numbers, but I\u2019m sure that had nothing to do with it.\u201d He signals sarcasm by using absolute words like \u201csure\u201d and \u201cnothing\u201d and by gesturing broadly with both hands. He also pauses to give his audience a moment to interpret his remark as the opposite of what he has said \u2013 that, in fact, \u201cmy high poll numbers have everything to do with impeachment.\u201d The remark is sarcastic because there\u2019s a clear target: the Democrats in Congress.\n\nBut at both the Tulsa rally and his April press conference, the president\u2019s controversial remarks didn\u2019t have such accompanying verbal and nonverbal cues. He wasn\u2019t being critical of anyone; he was simply asserting that testing leads to more infections, or asking what appeared to be sincere questions about the use of disinfectants to combat the virus. Chances are he literally meant what he said.\n\nAs the president has repeatedly demonstrated, a claim of intended sarcasm can be used to walk back a remark that has been criticized or otherwise fallen flat. Thanks to our slippery understanding of the term, along with the way sarcasm can be easily missed, it can function like a \u201cGet Out of Jail Free\u201d card: The speaker can take a conversational mulligan and try to make things right.\n\nWe\u2019ve all said things that we later regretted and appealed to \u201cjust kidding\u201d or \u201cI was being sarcastic.\u201d However, if we habitually reach for such excuses to absolve ourselves of linguistic sins, it becomes, like the little boy who cried wolf, less and less effective.\n\nRoger J.
