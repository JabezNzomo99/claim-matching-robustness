As such, he is often quoted in the context of business and entrepreneurship.\n\nHowever, the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post appears to be apocryphal. The DCNF keyword-searched the Henry Ford Museum\u2019s digital archive for the statement, but found nothing matching it. It doesn\u2019t appear in his autobiography \u201cMy Life and Work,\u201d either.\n\nFurthermore, the Henry Ford Museum does not include the saying on its list of more than 200 verified quotations from the automobile manufacturer.\n\nA variation of the expression was first connected to Ford in a 1999 cruise industry publication, though elements of the saying appeared earlier in other contexts, according to the website Quote Investigator. In this instance, the author did not credit Ford directly with the statement.\n\n\u201cThere is a problem trying to figure out what people want by canvassing them,\u201d wrote cruise ship designer John McNeece, reported Quote Investigator. \u201cI mean, if Henry Ford canvassed people on whether or not he should build a motor car, they\u2019d probably tell him what they really wanted was a faster horse.\u201d\n\nThe earliest attribution to Ford occurred in a 2001 letter sent to British publication Marketing Week, decades after Ford\u2019s death in 1947.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
