The original picture shows Thunberg posing with former Vice President Al Gore.\n\nThe Facebook post, which has been shared more than 160 times, used the image to suggest a connection between Thunberg, a 16-year-old Swedish climate activist, and Soros, a billionaire philanthropist and Democratic donor.\n\n\u201cThe Manufacturing of Greta Thunberg,\u201d reads the caption. \u201cA Decade of Social Manipulation for the Corporate Capture of Nature. A picture is worth a thousand words.\u201d (RELATED: Does This Picture Show Meghan Markle With George Soros\u2019 Son?)\n\nHowever, a reverse image search revealed the picture has actually been doctored. Soros\u2019s face has been superimposed over Gore\u2019s. Thunberg shared the original picture, which captures her December 2018 meeting with the former vice president, on her Twitter and Instagram accounts.\n\n\u201cThank you @algore for being a true pioneer. Very few people have done more. It was an honour to meet you,\u201d tweeted Thunberg.\n\nThe manipulated image appears to have originated from an article published satirical website called Secret News. Posted Aug. 28, the article claims Thunberg is the granddaughter of Soros and that her activism is funded by him. It is in this article that the photoshopped image appeared.\n\nThunberg made headlines earlier in September following an impassioned speech she gave at the United Nations Climate Change Summit in New York City. She chastised world leaders for not doing enough to address climate change and emphasized the urgency of the issue.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
