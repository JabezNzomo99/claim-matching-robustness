She was allegedly given a one-year loan and had to return the necklace in November 2016, which is why the Supreme Court ordered her to return it.\n\nAnother two blog posts from www.asensopinoy.info and www.onelinebalita.xyz accuse Aquino of using a necklace from Marcos during the Crazy Rich Asians premiere in Hollywood on August 12. Both of their headlines read: \u201cKwintas na suot ni Kris Aquino sa Crazy Rich Asian premiere si Imelda Marcos ang may ari!\u201d (The necklace that Kris Aquino wore to the Crazy Rich Asians premiere belongs to Imelda Marcos!)\n\nFacts: Aquino has previously denied that the necklace she wore to the APEC Summit was from Marcos. She also specified on her official Instagram account that the necklace she wore to the Crazy Rich Asians premiere was a custom-made piece by Cebu-based jewelry designers Diagold.\n\nIn October 2016, Aquino addressed rumors that the necklace she wore to the APEC Summit dinner was owned by Marcos. She said on Instagram that it was from the Italian brand Bottega Veneta and that she had the receipts to prove it. In the same post, she said that it was not made of diamonds, but of cubic zirconia and silver.\n\nIn a December 30, 2015 report on the Philippine Star, Presidential Commission on Good Government Commissioner Andrew de Castro said it was impossible for Aquino to have taken Marcos\u2019 necklace from their Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas vault. He also said, \u201cIt looks completely different.\u201d\n\nAs for the necklace she wore to the Crazy Rich Asians Hollywood premiere, Diagold has also said that the necklace was by them.\n\nThe blog www.onelinebalita.xyz has published hoax content in the past that Rappler has debunked.
