No, that's not true: the story was made up by a Canadian entertainment website that makes up tales about weird crimes and bizarre sex acts but always just for entertainment purposes. The story is not real.\n\nIt originated from an article published by World News Daily Report on November 19, 2018 titled \"Drug dealer busted after calling 911 to report 150-lbs of cocaine stolen\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nA man was arrested by the LAPD this morning after calling the police to report that rival drug dealers had stolen almost all of his drugs, leaving him \"only a few pounds\". 29-year old Jos\u00e9 Ramirez called the police around 10:15 AM to report that an armed robbery had just taken place at the \"drug safehouse\" he was watching.

The disclaimer on their website is pretty clear about that even though you have to scroll all the way down the page to find it:\n\nWorld News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website - even those based on real people - are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.\n\nIt is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run the satirical Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a satirical site spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al. Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nWe wrote about worldnewsdailyreport.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Hells Angels Did NOT Sue Canadian Government For $2 Billion Revenue Loss Over Legalization of Marijuana\n\u2022 Fake News: Alleged Son of Adolf Hitler NOT Planning to Write Sequel to Mein Kampf\n\u2022 Fake News: Woman Did NOT Sue Ex-roommate For $1.2m For Training Her Parrot to Sexually Harass Her\n\u2022 Fake News: Elderly Man NOT Accused of Bribing Police Officer for Giving a Biscuit to a Police Dog\n\u2022 Fake News: Woman NOT accused of stealing a pumpkin by hiding it in her vagina", "lang": "en"}
