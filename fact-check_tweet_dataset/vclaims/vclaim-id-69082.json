Tax reform and a pro-growth agenda have unleashed America's economic engine. #WVGOP #WVComeBack\"\n\nWe turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official federal data source for employment figures. The bureau collects both statistics -- job openings and unemployed workers.\n\nWe produced a chart to show how those trend lines interact:\n\nThe chart makes it clear: For the first time since both statistics were recorded at the same time, the number of job openings, shown in blue, has exceeded the number of unemployed workers, in red, in recent months.\n\nThis was the case in March, April, May and June. So the tweet understated the number of times, but was otherwise accurate.\n\nThe West Virginia Republican Party tweeted, \"For only the second time since 2000, there are more job openings than Americans who are unemployed.\"\n\nIn March, April, May and June, the number of job openings was higher than the number of unemployed Americans -- the first time since that has happened since both statistics were calculated.\n\nThat\u2019s four times rather than two, so the tweet actually undersold the accomplishment.
