So, as we did during the campaign, we\u2019ll highlight these repeats in our \u201cGroundhog Friday\u201d feature.\n\nFollow the links to our original stories on these claims for more information.\n\nOn jobs at Carrier, Dec. 6 in North Carolina: \u201cWe were very proud of saving 1,100 jobs in Indiana with the help of Mike Pence \u2026\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an exaggerated figure, as we noted when Trump and Vice President-elect Pence stopped at a Carrier plant in Indianapolis on Dec. 1 to announce a deal with the company to save jobs that were scheduled to be moved to Mexico.\n\nThe company told us that the agreement \u2014 which reportedly includes $7 million in tax breaks over 10 years \u2014 prevents 800 factory jobs from going to Mexico. Another 300 jobs in \u201cheadquarters and engineering\u201d at the plant were never going to be shifted to Mexico, but instead were slated to move to another facility in Indiana, the company representative said.\n\nWhen a union official correctly pointed out Trump\u2019s inflated figure, the president-elect fired off two tweets criticizing the union official, saying the man had \u201cdone a terrible job representing workers\u201d and that if the local union \u201cwas any good, they would have kept those jobs in Indiana.\u201d\n\nWhile the deal negotiated by Trump keeps 800 of the factory jobs in Indianapolis, another 600 factory jobs will still move to Mexico. And Carrier\u2019s parent company, United Technologies Electronic Controls, will still close its manufacturing plant in Huntington, Indiana, shifting another 700 factory jobs to Mexico \u2014 for a net loss of 1,300 jobs.\n\nOn the trade deficit, Dec. 6 in North Carolina: \u201cOn trade, our trade deficit now nearly $800 billion a year. We have a deficit \u2014 think of it \u2014 of almost $800 billion a year.\u201d\n\nWe heard this one a lot on the campaign trail, and it ended up in our \u201cGroundhog Friday\u201d reports a few times. It\u2019s still an incomplete picture of trade.\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit was $531.5 billion in 2015. Trump\u2019s \u201cnearly $800 billion\u201d number involves a generous rounding-up and pertains to the trade deficit for goods only, which was $758.9 billion in 2015. But the U.S. has a trade surplus in services, such as travel, education and intellectual property, resulting in a trade deficit of $531.5 billion for goods and services.\n\nOn support from African American and Hispanic voters, Dec. 6 in North Carolina: \u201cWe did so well, so much better with African American communities, with Hispanic communities than anybody ever anticipated. \u2026 So much better, better than has taken place in years back, in years back. So I want to thank the African American communities. I want to thank the Hispanic communities.\u201d\n\nIt depends on what Trump meant by \u201cin years back.\u201d\n\nAs we wrote when Trump claimed his percentage of the black vote was \u201chigher than all of the Republican candidates for years,\u201d that\u2019s true when compared with Republicans who ran against Barack Obama, the first black president. But Trump did about the same or worse, as a percentage, than every other previous Republican since 1968.\n\nAccording to exit polls, Trump garnered 8 percent of the black vote, while Clinton got 88 percent. That\u2019s better than what Republican nominees Mitt Romney (6 percent in 2012) and John McCain (4 percent in 2008) got when they squared off against Obama. But it\u2019s a little less than George W. Bush got in 2004 (11 percent), and about the same as Bush got in 2000 (8 percent). But prior to that, you\u2019d have to go back nine presidential elections, to Barry Goldwater (6 percent) in 1964, to find a Republican presidential candidate who won a smaller percentage of support from black voters than Trump.\n\nAs for the Hispanic vote, exit polls show Trump got 29 percent \u2013 which was better than only four of the last 11 Republican nominees dating to 1972. Trump did better than Mitt Romney (27 percent in 2012), Bob Dole (21 percent in 1996), George H.W. Bush (25 percent in 1992) and Gerald Ford (24 percent in 1976). But the president-elect did worse among Hispanics compared with John McCain (31 percent in 2008), George W. Bush (35 percent in 2000 and 44 percent in 2004), George H.W. Bush (30 percent in 1988), Ronald Reagan (37 percent in both 1980 and 1984), and Richard Nixon (34 percent in 1972).\n\nOn unemployment, Dec. 8 in Iowa: \u201cGot to get the jobs. Got 96 million people out there. We got to get them going, and they want to work. They gave up looking for jobs.\u201d\n\nThroughout the presidential campaign, Trump argued that the \u201creal\u201d unemployment rate was higher than the official one, because he said it did not include those so frustrated by the labor market that they simply gave up looking for work. But as we wrote last February, Trump\u2019s wildly inflated unemployment rates revealed a misunderstanding of the way unemployment statistics are tallied.\n\nAccording to the latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are 95 million people \u201cnot in the labor force.\u201d But Trump is wrong to say \u201cthey want to work.\u201d In fact, according to BLS, only 5.5 million of them \u201ccurrently want a job.\u201d Those not looking for a job include millions of retirees, teenagers and stay-at-home parents. For example, there are 18.2 million people age 75 and older who were not in the work force in November, BLS says.\n\nOn his tax plan, Dec. 6 in North Carolina: \u201cAnd massive tax cuts, by the way, for middle-class workers, massive.\u201d\n\nAnd Dec. 8 in Iowa: \u201cFirst on taxes, we\u2019re going to undertake one of the great tax reforms and simplifications in American history. It\u2019s going to be simpler. Too much work, too complicated. And the center of the plan is massive tax relief for the American middle class has been forgotten \u2026 forgotten.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t know what Trump may do as president, but the tax plan he proposed during the campaign does include an average tax cut for middle-income earners. Whether that\u2019s the \u201ccenter of the plan\u201d or \u201cmassive,\u201d however, is debatable. The average percentage change is larger for upper-income earners. The middle quintile would see a 1.8 percent average increase in after-tax income in 2017, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center. The fourth quintile would see a larger average increase \u2014 2.2 percent \u2014 and the top quintile would get an even larger average increase in after-tax income \u2014 6.6 percent. The top 0.1 percent would get an average increase of 14.2 percent.\n\n\u201cHis proposal would cut taxes at all income levels, although the largest benefits, in dollar and percentage terms, would go to the highest-income households,\u201d the TPC wrote in its Oct. 18 analysis.\n\nThe pro-business Tax Foundation found the same type of outcomes, with those in middle-income groups seeing a less than 2 percent average increase in after-tax income, and those in the top 10 percent of income earners getting a 5.4 percent to 8.3 percent average increase on a static basis.\n\nWhether these changes are \u201cmassive\u201d for the \u201cmiddle-class\u201d is a matter of opinion. It\u2019s a vague statement, unlike the specific \u2014 and misleading \u2014 figures Trump touted near the end of the campaign. It\u2019s worth noting that these are average estimates \u2014 some would see a larger increase in after-tax income and some would see less. In fact, some families, particularly some of those headed by single parents, would see an increase in their tax bills under the plan Trump has proposed. \u201cAbout 20 percent of households and more than half of single parents would pay more in taxes,\u201d Lily Batchelder, a visiting fellow at the Tax Policy Center and a professor at the New York University School of Law, calculated in an Oct. 28 paper.\n\nOn crime, Dec. 6 in North Carolina: \u201cOn crime, the murder rate has experienced its largest increase in 45 years. We are going to support the incredible men and women of law enforcement, and we are going to bring this terrible crime wave to an end. Highest in 45 years, the murder rate.\u201d\n\nTrump was accurate in saying that the murder rate \u201chas experienced its largest increase in 45 years,\u201d but then went on to repeat the false claim that the murder rate was the \u201chighest in 45 years,\u201d a bogus statement he made repeatedly in the final weeks of the presidential campaign. (He got the statistic right in his speech in Iowa this week.) And Trump gave a misleading impression of the big picture on crime in claiming that he would bring \u201cthis terrible crime wave to an end.\u201d\n\nThe rate for 2015 for murder and nonnegligent manslaughter was 4.9 per 100,000 inhabitants, according to FBI data. That\u2019s lower than the rate in 1970, 45 years earlier, which was 7.9 per 100,000 inhabitants. Last year\u2019s figure is also less than half the peak murder rate of 10.2 per 100,000 inhabitants in 1980. However, 2015\u2019s rate is the highest since 2009, when it was 5 per 100,000 people. That makes it the highest in six years, not 45 years.\n\nBut, the 2015 murder rate was 10 percent higher than it was in 2014. That\u2019s the highest one-year increase \u201cin nearly half a century,\u201d according to the New York Times.\n\nDoes that one-year jump mean the U.S. is in the midst of a \u201cterrible crime wave\u201d? The Times quoted Richard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s too early to call this an end to the crime drop, but we are facing a one-year rise in murders that is quite substantial \u2014 the largest in about half a century.\u201d\n\nAs the chart here shows, the murder rate has dropped substantially since its peak in 1980 and similarly high levels in the early 1990s.", "lang": "en"}
