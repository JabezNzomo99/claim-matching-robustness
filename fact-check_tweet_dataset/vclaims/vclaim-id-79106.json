Scott Walker\u2019s future, Ross criticized the governor\u2019s performance on a number of fronts. Under Walker, he said, Wisconsin is \"last in the Midwest in job creation\" and \"we've moved from 16th to third in percentage of people with student loan debt.\"\n\nDemocratic challenger Mary Burke used versions of the claim in her unsuccessful campaign against Walker in 2014. In March 2015, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, said the state \"is dead last in the Midwest for job creation.\" We rated that Mostly True -- the state was tied for 9th place at the time.\n\nBut what about Ross\u2019 student-debt claim?\n\nHave Wisconsin college students leaped up the chart in how much they owe? And is it because of Walker, as Ross implied?\n\nWhen we asked Ross for backup, he wrote in an email: \"I misread a number from my written show prep notes. It's 10th not 16th.\" He made a light-hearted suggestion at what rating he deserves, too: \"Mostly Old.\"\n\nAlas, that\u2019s not a category on the Truth-O-Meter.\n\nRoss said the data he cited came from the Institute for College Access & Success, an independent non-profit group.\n\nThe group\u2019s 2015 report said that state students owed an average of $28,810, a level that was No. 3 in the nation based on the percent of students. Some 70 percent of state students have college debt, the report said.\n\nThe group\u2019s report from 2012, reflecting data from 2011, the first year of Walker\u2019s term, said state student debt averaged $26,238 and the state had a ranking of 10th in the nation. In 2011, 67 percent of state students had loans.\n\nSo, while Ross got the numbers wrong, debt has increased for state students in the years Walker has been governor.\n\nThe part of Ross\u2019s claim that suggests student debt increased due to action by Walker is more problematic.\n\nIn August 2015, Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush claimed student loan debt had doubled under President Barack Obama. That was rated Half True. Experts said the level of debt was rising before Obama took office in 2009, due to the recession and other factors beyond the president\u2019s control.\n\nThe economic downturn pushed states to cut higher education funding, and schools increased tuition to cover costs, Donald Heller, dean of the College of Education at Michigan State University, told PolitiFact.\n\nSince 1980, private college tuition has increased about 200 percent, while public school tuition has increased about 300 percent, with the by far the biggest jump happening since 2008, according to College Board data compiled by Heller.\n\nThe Federal Reserve put student debt nationally at about $1.3 trillion as of September 2015. That compares with $844 billion in 2010 and $640 billion in 2008, shortly after the economy crashed.\n\nRoss said that in the time Walker has led Wisconsin, student debt increased to third in the country. He acknowledged he got the number wrong, making the jump seem bigger than it was, but was correct that more state students have college loans.\n\nHe\u2019s less accurate about the implication that the increase in debt is due to Walker. To be sure there have been cuts to education and the UW System under Walker, but Ross offered no evidence that those cuts drove state students debt higher. And student debt nationally has increased sharply in the years he has been in office.\n\nWe rate the claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
