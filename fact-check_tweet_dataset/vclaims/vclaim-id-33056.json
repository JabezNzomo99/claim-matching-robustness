(Ranking members earn higher salaries: House Speaker receives $223,500, Senate president pro tempore receives $193,400 and majority and minority leaders in both chambers receive $193,400.)\n\nPrior to 1989, Congress had to enact legislation to increase these salaries. That ended after Congress passed a law authorizing the automatic yearly adjustments they have received since then.

Congressional salaries go up if there is a measurable increase in the Employment Cost Index year over year, unless the adjustment is statutorily denied. Congress hasn\u2019t seen a salary increase since 2009, when they first instituted the pay freeze.\n\nSince 1989, the salaries of non-ranking members have increased roughly 94 percent from $89,500 to the current $174,000. When adjusted for inflation, however, they\u2019ve actually gone down in that 30-year period.\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say members of Congress haven\u2019t pushed for raising their own salaries in the past 10 years. Some legislators, including House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, advocated for lifting the pay freeze in June.\n\nUnder the law authorizing the automatic adjustments, non-ranking members would see a 2.6 percent \u2014 or $4,500 \u2014 salary increase if the pay freeze was lifted, though the effort to do so has since stalled.", "lang": "en"}
