Snopes readers asked us to look into one such gathering on the Fourth of July, when a group of heavily armed Black militia members allegedly marched on a Confederate monument in Georgia\u2019s Stone Mountain Park:\n\nNews reports and statements from park officials confirm that this rally did indeed take place, though social media posts such as the above misrepresented significant details of the event.\n\nAround 1,000 predominantly Black militia members, wearing paramilitary-style clothing and wielding rifles, gathered at the Stone Mountain sculpture of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and military leaders Robert E. Lee and Thomas \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson. White nationalist rallies have taken place there in the past, and the monument has historical ties to the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nThe group behind the march, known as the Not Fucking Around Coalition (they have no known affiliation with the Black Panther Party, contrary to what is stated in the tweet above), identifies as an all-Black militia, and said they were also not connected to the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nSpeakers at the rally challenged white supremacists to face them, and called for the monument\u2019s removal. While the majority of attendees were Black, Reuters reported that individuals of other ethnicities were also spotted in the crowd.\n\nThe group also had a police escort, and the march was peaceful. John Bankhead, a spokesperson for the Stone Mountain Memorial Association, the organization that operates the park, said:\n\nIt\u2019s a public park, state park. We have these protests on both sides of the issue from time to time. We respect people\u2019s First Amendment right to exercise those rights. We understand the sensitivity of the issues here at the park and the dark past so we respect that and allow them to come in. As long as it\u2019s peaceful, which it has been, then that\u2019s fine.\n\nSnopes reached out to the park\u2019s association for more information, and will update this article if we hear back.\n\nGiven the ample media coverage, footage of the Black militia, and statements from park officials confirming that such a march did take place, we rate this claim as \u201cTrue.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
