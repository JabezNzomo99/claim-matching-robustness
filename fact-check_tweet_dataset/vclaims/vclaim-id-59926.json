PM Modi is set to visit Ayodhya on \u20185 August 2020\u2019 to lay the foundation stone for \u2018Ram Temple\u2019. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nWhen we subjected the image to reverse image search technique, the same image was found in an article of a blog \u2018Sapost.blogspot.com\u2019. The blog article was published on \u201826 September 2017\u2019 and it had the title \u2018\u200bIndia Post issued a set of 11 commemorative postage stamps on \u201cRAMAYANA\u201d on 22.09.2017\u2019.\n\nWith the above information, when we looked on \u2018India Postage Stamps\u2019 website, a link was found which says that India Post has issued a set of 11 Commemorative postage stamps on \u2018Ramayana\u2019 on \u201822 September 2017\u2019. The viral image can be seen in that link of \u2018India Postage Stamps\u2019 website.\n\nThe Postage stamps on \u2018Ramayana\u2019 were released by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Varanasi in September 2017.\n\nSeveral news articles were found that reported that on 5 August 2020, after the \u2018Bhoomi Puja\u2019 event at Ayodhya, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to launch postal stamps on a symbolic model of the Ram temple and the Ramayana. Those reports can be seen here and here. However, the stamps in the image shared on social media are not new.\n\nTo sum it up, image of Commemorative postage stamps on \u2018Ramayana\u2019 released in 2017 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is shared those released recently.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
