The CDC has said an antibody test might give a positive result if antibodies from another coronavirus are present.\n\nThe image, which shows a screen grab of a July 1 article published by the website Gateway Pundit, alleges that the CDC has said common cold can cause a positive COVID-19 test result. The text accompanying the Instagram post appears to lift from the original version of that article and quotes language from the CDC\u2019s website.\n\nOther posts use a screen grab of the CDC website to make the same claim, with one commenting, \u201cThe COMMON COLD can produce a positive COVID test!! do the increase of numbers really mean ANYTHING at this point??\u201d\n\nBut the posts appear to incorrectly equate information about COVID-19 antibody tests with viral tests. (RELATED: Viral Post Claims Flu Vaccines Can Make People Test Positive For COVID-19)\n\nThere are two kinds of COVID-19 testing: viral and antibody. An antibody test can show if a person has previously had COVID-19, whereas a viral test shows if a person has a current infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, according to the CDC.\n\nThe CDC website states that \u201cthere is a chance\u201d a COVID-19 antibody test may produce a positive result if \u201cyou have antibodies from an infection with a virus from the same family of viruses.\u201d Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).\n\nBecause it can take one to three weeks for the body to produce antibodies, an antibody test may not show if a person currently has COVID-19, according to the CDC. A person must get a viral test to determine if he or she currently has a COVID-19 infection.\n\n\u201cExcept in instances in which viral testing is delayed, antibody tests should not be used to diagnose a current COVID-19 infection,\u201d the CDC states on its website.\n\nGateway Pundit later updated its article to reflect that the information from the CDC\u2019s page on antibody testing relates to \u201cthe \u2018past infection\u2019 test, not the current COVID-19 test to see if you have the virus right now.\u201d It also now notes that current case counts do not include antibody tests.\n\nAs of press time, the U.S. has reported over 3 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and over 132,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.", "lang": "en"}
