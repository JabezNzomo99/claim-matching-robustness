This claim requires context.\n\nExamples of the claim can be seen here and here . One post states it is now illegal to film police and doing so could lead to a $750 fine, while another states that a Tucson City Council ordinance makes it illegal to film the police.\n\nAlthough the ordinance passed in April, this claim is gaining traction on social media following the recent wave of protests in the U.S. against police brutality ( here ).\n\nOn April 21, 2020, the Tucson City Council unanimously passed Ordinance 11746, effective immediately ( here ).\n\nThe ordinance states that the public has the right to free speech and to continue recording the activities of law enforcement in public areas. However, it prohibits an individual or group of people from interfering with an officer engaged in \u201clawful police activity\u201d such as an investigation or a crime scene ( here ).\n\nUnder the provisions of this ordinance, police officers can set up crime scene boundaries, which in effect function as \u201cdo not cross lines\u201d for individuals or groups who might want to record the activities of law enforcement officers. It states that the distance involved is not the same for every situation and that \u201cin most circumstances where no one is hindering or obstructing a police activity, no \u2018do not cross line\u2019 or boundary is ever set.\u201d\n\nViolating the ordinance can result in a Class 2 misdemeanor charge punishable with a $750 dollar fine or four months in jail ( here ).\n\nAccording to local media reports, the Tucson City Council approved and adopted the ordinance in an attempt to curb people from interfering with the activities of the Tucson Police Department (TPD) and endangering the lives of officers, the public and themselves ( here ; here ).\n\nTucson Mayor Regina Romero and council members have argued that the ordinance was a result of incidents of an auditor \u201charassing\u201d police officers on duty, seen here , according to KOLD News 13.\n\nSome critics of the ordinance see it as a means of discouraging the public from recording police misconduct, despite the inclusion of First Amendment protections in its provisions ( here ).\n\nThe ordinance also leaves it to officers\u2019 discretion in how they set up crime scene areas or define \u201cdo not cross\u201d lines. Tucson City Council argues that the specificity of the ordinance\u2019s language, and additional training will prevent abuses ( here ).\n\nMichael Avery, emeritus professor of law at Suffolk University and president of the board of the National Police Accountability Project, told Reuters that he thinks the ordinance poses the risk of being applied and interpreted unconstitutionally by police officers.\n\nAvery said that given the history of police fighting in court against the right for the public to record officers in public, there is a danger of officers abusing the ordinance to shield their activities from public scrutiny. According to Avery, these risks make the ordinance \u201ca bad idea.\u201d He added that the ordinance \u201cwill lead to repeated litigation about how it is applied and, in the meantime, the rights of the public to record police activity will compromised.\u201d\n\nTucson Council Member Steve Kozachik told Reuters via email that the claims on social media are \u201cwholly inaccurate\u201d. He referred to how the ordinance \u201cexplicitly allows for videotaping police activity\u201d and said, \u201cnothing in this ordinance remotely prevents that from being done.\u201d He also added that police officers wear body cameras and said the City Council had not received any complaints involving the concern that police would set up a crime scene in a way that prevents the ability to film.\n\nThe attention the ordinance has received on social media, including by celebrities including Ice Cube ( here ) and Armie Hammer ( here ), has prompted the Tucson City Council to consider community input and place the ordinance back under further review, as per a statement posted on Twitter by Tucson\u2019s mayor ( here ).\n\nMayor Regina Romero and the Tucson Police Department did not respond to Reuters request for comment by the time of this fact check\u2019s publication.\n\nPartly false. In April 2020, the city of Tucson, Arizona approved an ordinance that prohibited recording police officers in some circumstances. After public scrutiny, the ordinance was submitted for review.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
