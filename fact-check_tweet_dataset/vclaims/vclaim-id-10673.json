But it was done right away for Whitney Houston way to go Obama _____________________________________________________________________________ You know President Obama's a real douchebag will lower the flag for a crack whore Whitney Houston but not former First Lady Nancy Reagan what a grade a asshole he must be _____________________________________________________________________________ There's a rumor that Pres. Obama ordered the flag lowered for Whitney Huston but not Nancy Reagan, is this true?\n\nShortly after former first lady Nancy Reagan passed away in early March 2016, social media users began claiming that President Barack Obama had ordered U.S. flags to be lowered to mark the death of singer Whitney Houston in 2012, but he did not extend that honor to Nancy Reagan.\n\nThat rumor was easily disproved. First was the claim that President Obama ordered flags to be flown at half-staff following the death of Whitney Houston is false. That symbolic gesture was undertaken only in the state of New Jersey (where Houston was born) and was the result of a statewide directive issued by New Jersey governor Chris Christie. There was no corresponding national proclamation from President Obama:\n\nHouston, a New Jersey native, was also buried in that state, and New Jersey governor Chris Christie made a somewhat controversial decision in directing all New Jersey state flags to be flown at half-staff in her honor \u2014 critics contended that such a gesture should be reserved for members of the military, first responders, and state officials, and also that \u201cit was wrong to honor a drug addict.\u201d Governor Christie defended his decision, saying: \u201cI am disturbed by people who believe that because of her history of substance abuse that somehow she\u2019s forfeited the good things that she did in her life.\u201d (The previous year, Governor Christie had also directed flags to be flown at half-staff to mark the passing of Clarence Clemons, the saxophonist for Bruce Springsteen\u2019sE Street Band, with little public outcry.)\n\nThe day after Nancy Reagan\u2019s death was reported, President Obama called for all flags at the White House and federal buildings to be flown at half-staff until sunset on the day of her burial:\n\nPresident Obama [has] ordered flags to fly at half-staff to honor former first lady Nancy Reagan, who died at 94. The president issued a proclamation calling for flags to be lowered at the White House, military posts and all public grounds \u201cas a mark of respect for the memory of Nancy Reagan.\u201d Flags will fly at half-staff until sunset on the day she is buried alongside her husband at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif.\n\nAdditionally, Barack and Michelle Obama issued a joint statement in which they lauded the former first lady\u2019s \u201cproud example, and her warm and generous advice.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
