Gov. Don Beyer has his eyes set on the 8th District congressional seat in Northern Virginia, calling for stronger guns laws, protecting the environment and expanded family leave when a baby arrives.\n\n\"The United States is the only industrialized country that does not guarantee paid time off to care for a new child...\" Beyer, a Democrat, on his campaign website.\n\nWe wondered if he\u2019s right.\n\nThe Family and Medical Leave Act some workers to 12 weeks of unpaid leave time when they have babies. The law has many exceptions; it does not apply, for example, to businesses with fewer than 50 employees or to workers who have been at a company for less than a year.\n\nThree states -- California, New Jersey and Rhode Island -- provide paid family leave through payroll taxes. And some companies go beyond federal requirements and provide paid leave. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates 12 percent of private industry workers have access to paid leave.\n\nBut the bottom line, as Beyer says, is that the U.S. does not require parents be compensated when they take time off to care for newborns.\n\nHow does that compare to the rest of the world? Beyer\u2019s office pointed us to a released this year by the International Labour Organization, a United Nations agency. It examined maternity and paternity leave in 185 countries and territories and found that 99 percent of them require compensated maternity leave -- paid by the countries through a social insurance program, by employers, or a combination of these sources.\n\nMothers in only two countries, the United States and Papau New Guinea, aren\u2019t guaranteed paid maternity leave, according to the report.\n\nBeyer\u2019s office also sent us a to a PolitiFact National story that President Barack Obama\u2019s claim in June that the U.S. is the only developed country that doesn\u2019t provide paid maternity leave.\n\nOur colleagues rated Obama\u2019s claim Mostly True, saying that U.S. leave policies for mothers is among the most meager in the world. But they noted that paid maternity leave isn\u2019t a universal right around the world because many countries don\u2019t offer the benefits to all working mothers of newborns.\n\nFor example, temporary workers don\u2019t receive cash benefits in Canada, home workers don\u2019t get maternity leave in Norway and Switzerland, and some civil servants don\u2019t get leave in Japan.\n\nCanada also excludes migrant workers and moms that own more than 40 percent of their business and it requires women to have at least 600 hours of insurable employment to be eligible.\n\nThere\u2019s a wrinkle that makes Beyer\u2019s statement a slightly different from Obama\u2019s comment on maternity leave. Beyer uses the phrase \"family leave,\" which can be interpreted as including paid time off for fathers.\n\nIn the U.S. dads, just like moms, have a right to time off, but it\u2019s not paid. The ILO worldwide data on fathers is not as extensive as on mothers, but suggests most developed nations offer paternity leave benefits.\n\nAmy Raub, a principal research assistant at the World Policy Analysis Center at UCLA told us a handful of other developed countries, in addition to the U.S., don\u2019t provide paid time off for fathers.\n\nBeyer says the U.S. is the only industrialized country that doesn\u2019t guarantee parents paid time off to care for their newborns.\n\nTo a very large extent, he\u2019s right. The U.S. is the only developed country that doesn\u2019t mandate paid leave for working mothers, according to United Nations\u2019 statistics.\n\nBut there are two footnotes to Beyer\u2019s statement: 1) Many nations that mandate paid maternity leave don\u2019t offer the benefit to all moms and; 2) There are a handful of developed nations in addition to the U.S. that don\u2019t offer paid paternity leave.\n\nSo we rate Beyer\u2019s statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
