(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nPrecise numbers for the period cited in the post are not available in any of the three categories, but the best numbers suggest these figures are inaccurate. Generally in the United States, however, elective abortions are performed at a much higher rate than deaths by COVID-19 or the flu, which are viruses that surely no one chooses to catch.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about the numbers during the roughly eight-week period from Jan. 22, 2020 through March 17, 2020, the date of the post:\n\nCOVID-19 deaths: The first U.S. death from the novel coronavirus was reported on Feb. 29, 2020. By March 17, 2020, the number of COVID-19 related deaths was reported to be 110, more than four times what this Facebook post suggests.\n\nFlu deaths: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated there would be 23,000 flu deaths during the 2019-2020 flu season, which began Sept. 29, 2019, according to the latest weekly update from the released March 14, 2020. That\u2019s an average of 958 deaths per week, or 7,664 over the eight-week period this post describes, not, 4,700.\n\nAbortions: Abortions are reported on an annual basis. The latest figures, from the nonprofit Alan Guttmacher Institute, are for 2017, when there were an estimated 862,320 abortions. That\u2019s an average of 16,583 per week, or 132,664 over eight weeks\n\nIt\u2019s worth pointing out that an abortion is an elective medical procedure, something that cannot be said for someone who is afflicted by contagion and dies.\n\nPrecise numbers for Jan. 22, 2020, through March 17, 2020, are not available in any of the three categories. It\u2019s generally true that the number of abortions in the United States far outpaces the number of deaths to COVID-19 or the flu. But the numbers included in this post are not in line with the best data.\n\nAbortion is an elective procedure, not a disease.\n\nFor a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
