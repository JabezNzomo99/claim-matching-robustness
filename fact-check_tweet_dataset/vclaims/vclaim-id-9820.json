He always wanted to work for CNN and be an actor. #GunReformNow #NeverAgain\"\n\nBut the image accompanying the tweet is taken from the 2017 Stoneman High School yearbook.\n\nJoey Wong, a student at the Parkland, Fla., high school, posted a video of his yearbook on Twitter showing the cover and the page from the viral image.\n\n\"Okay, so, what we have here is a Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School yearbook from the school year 2017, Florida, and bookmarked is David Hogg\u2019s yearbook photo from the same book,\" Wong says in the video. \"David Hogg, 11th grade. This is last year. He\u2019s right here. That\u2019s him.\"\n\nAnother student, Sarah Chadwick, echoed Wong\u2019s confirmation in another tweet.\n\n\"She claims it\u2019s not a Douglas yearbook (which I promise it is, I know multiple people in that picture) yet there\u2019s someone in the pic wearing a douglas t-shirt????\" Chadwick tweeted.\n\nHogg did not graduate from a California high school in 2015; in fact, he was on the cross country team at Stoneman that year. The Sun-Sentinel published a photo of one of his races.\n\nHogg did, however, live in California prior to Florida. His father, Kevin Hogg, was an FBI agent assigned to the Los Angeles International Airport before his retirement to Florida in 2014.\n\nAccording to a tweet by Daniel Williams, a fellow student, Hogg moved to Florida their freshman year and has not transferred since.\n\n\"He moved from California our freshman year and hasn't transferred since. I've worked with him in many tv production project and sorry @davidhogg111 but he isn't that great of an actor,\" Williams tweeted.\n\nWe rate this statement Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
