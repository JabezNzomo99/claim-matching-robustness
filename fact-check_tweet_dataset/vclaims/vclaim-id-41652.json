But Kentucky isn\u2019t dispatching its teachers to help \"maintain a healthy learning environment\" by conducting bedroom inspections of elementary and middle school aged kids.\n\n\"Governor Andy Beshear has authorized Kentucky teachers to make in-home visits. With parental approval, teachers will inspect the bedroom of each student currently enrolled in K-8,\" reads an image of what looks like a flyer from the state\u2019s education department. \"Teachers will observe social distancing during these in-home visits. Please have our child throughly (sic) clean their room in preparation for the visit. Teachers WILL contact you to schedule your appointment. Your student WILL BE evaluated for an official grade.\"\n\nParents, they WILL NOT. This post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe Louisville Courier-Journal writes that \"a prankster thought it would be funny to worry Kentucky parents.\" But, the newspaper reported, the bedroom bulletin is a hoax.\n\nOn Facebook and Twitter the Kentucky Department of Education wrote: \"Families: We are aware of a fake social media post going around with our logo (as well as a KDE logo that hasn\u2019t been used in many years) & logos of other state agencies. Please be assured that any official document from us will be posted from this official account.\"\n\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
