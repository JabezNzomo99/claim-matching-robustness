The viral video is edited in such a way that it gives an impression that Rahul is taking incorrect names of MP and Chhattisgarh chief ministers.\n\nShivraj's tweet grabbed more than 4,000 retweets and 12,000 likes. The video has been shared by netizens across social media.\n\nThe websites of Times Now, Republic and India Today and YouTube channel News Tak also got misled by the viral video. However, News Tak later deleted the video.\n\nWe found that the viral video is clipped from the original video of Rahul\u2019s rally held in MP\u2019s Neemuch on May 14.\n\nIn the original video, Rahul starts his speech by saying, \"Kamal Nath ji Madhya Pradesh ke Chief Minister, Bhupesh Baghel ji Chhattisgarh ke Chief Minister, Hukum Singh Karada ji, P C Sharma ji\". The original video can be seen here.\n\nThe part where Rahul says Kamal Nath ji\u2019 has deliberately been edited to give it a wrong twist.\n\nIt is clear from the original video that Rahul correctly took the names of MP and Chhattisgarh chief ministers.\n\nA possible reason for confusion could be that the live feed of Rahul Gandhi's speech shared by Congress on its official Twitter handle started a few seconds later and made it seem like Congress chief said, \"Madhya Pradesh chief minister Bhupesh Baghelji, Chhattisgarh chief minister Hukum Singh Karadaji...\"\n\nHowever, the speech broadcast live on Congress party's YouTube page has his full speech, where has included the name of Kamal Nath.", "lang": "en"}
