Biden\u2019s tax plan calls for several changes aimed at raising up to $4 trillion in tax revenues over a decade, according to a March analysis from the Tax Policy Center, an independent group that models the effects of tax legislation.\n\nBut Biden has not proposed bumping the federal income tax rate up to 25% for households earning $75,000 (or $78,000). The Associated Press and Reuters have already debunked the false Facebook claim, and Factcheck.org quashed a similar attack from President Donald Trump in May.\n\nBiden\u2019s tax plan has been examined by tax analysts from multiple independent groups, including the Tax Policy Center, the Tax Foundation, the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Penn Wharton Budget Model and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nAmong Biden\u2019s proposed changes, he would:\n\u2022 Increase the top corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.\n\u2022 \u201cWe\u2019re the only major gas-producing state in the US that doesn\u2019t have a severance tax.\u201d\n\u2022 Tax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income for very high earners.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing in Biden\u2019s plan, according to the analyses we reviewed, that would raise the federal income tax rate for a family making $75,000 or $78,000.\n\nGroups that have examined Biden\u2019s tax plan, including the Tax Policy Center and the Committee for a Responsible Budget, have estimated that after-tax income for some lower earners could slightly decrease. But that\u2019s not because of a higher tax rate.\n\nGordon Mermin, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center and co-author of the group\u2019s March report, said the small increases dealt to the lower income groups would be almost all due to \"indirect effects of the increase in the corporate tax rate,\" such as lowered wages for workers.\n\nThey would not be the result of direct changes to the federal income tax rate. \"No direct taxes are imposed on any household making less than $400,000 per year,\" the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote in its analysis of Biden's plan.\n\nOn average, the Tax Policy Center\u2019s March report predicted that the bottom 80% of earners could wind up paying between $30 and $590 extra on Biden\u2019s watch. It estimated that over 90% of the tax increases would be borne by the top 20% of earners.\n\nA Facebook post said, \"Biden\u2019s tax rate on a family making 75,000 dollars would go from 12% to 25%.\"\n\nBiden hasn\u2019t proposed raising the federal income tax rate from 12% to 25% for married couples filing jointly and earning $75,000.", "lang": "en"}
