The posts are false as they used an old video available online that can be traced back to 2013 in Bangladesh.\n\nThe misleading posts, including this one published on December 21, 2018, purports to show, people from a Hindu community in a village in Rajasthan in western India.\n\nThe posts claim the violence occurred after the Indian National Congress party won state elections held that month.\n\nThe Hindi-language caption to the post translates to: \u201cAfter the formation of Congress government in Rajasthan, Muslims torched the houses of Marvadi Hindus and killed two of them in Darti village in Jaisalmer on the India-Pakistan border.\u201d\n\nA similar post has also been shared here.\n\nThe Indian National Congress, the main opposition party, did win the state elections. Here is a local news report on the result.\n\nHowever, a reverse image search found the video in the misleading post was posted repeatedly online in 2013 about an incident in Bangladesh.\n\nThere are several videos of the 2013 incident available on Youtube for example, here and here.\n\nThe earliest version AFP was able track down is one below posted to Youtube on March 2, 2013. It saId the incident took place on February 28, 2018 in Noakhali in Bangladesh.\n\nThe people in the video are speaking the Bengali language spoken by the Bangladeshis. Starting at 0:05 seconds in the video above, a woman says: \"Our eyes were blindfolded and we were forced out of our homes. Fire destroyed our homes, we lost everything.\"\n\nThis is the same quote as in the false Facebook post. The lady can be seen saying the same thing at the very start of that post.\n\nAt 4 minute 36 seconds of the video from Bangladesh embedded above, a namplate can be seen in Bengali that translates to: \u2018Office of the Police Superintendent Noakhali.\n\nA policeman then states the following: \u201cUntil now 10 of the suspects have been arrested in connection with the incident. Accompanied by the district magistrate, I visited the place yesterday. Policemen have been posted in the area to bring back confidence of the people.\"\n\nNoakhali is district in South-eastern Bangladesh, located in Chittagong division.\n\nThat video matches with violence against Hindus that happened in Noakhali on February 28, 2013 and was reported in international media.\n\nHere is an AFP on that violence. The violence story was also published in other local media reports such as here, here and here.", "lang": "en"}
