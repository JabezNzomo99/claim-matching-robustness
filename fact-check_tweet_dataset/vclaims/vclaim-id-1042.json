This is incorrect.\n\nThe statue of the former British prime minister, which stands in Parliament Square, was pictured on June 7 with the words \u201cWas a Racist\u201d written across the base. ( here )\n\nHowever, the photos used in the posts were not taken during the 2020 protests, but in demonstrations in 2000 and 2010.\n\nThe first photo, which has been shared with text suggesting it was taken during the June protests, shows heavy graffiti on the plinth of the statue ( here and here ).\n\nAccording to stock photo agency Alamy, on whose website the image is available to buy, it shows the Churchill statue in Parliament Square during anti-capitalist May Day demonstrations in 2000 ( here ). The photo is credited to Janine Wiedel, and appears on her website with the same information ( here ).\n\nThe second photo shows people sitting on the plinth of the statue, and what appears to be someone urinating against it. Like the first, it has been shared with text claiming it was taken during the BLM protests ( here and here ).\n\nIt was actually taken during a demonstration against student tuition fees in December 2010, and was published in a Daily Mail article about the protest ( here ). The photograph is credited to Joanne Davidson, who captions the photo on her website as: \u201c2010 student demonstrations in Parliament Square \u2013 a protester urinates on the statue of Winston Churchill\u201d ( here ).\n\nAlthough it is true that the Churchill statue in Parliament Square was daubed with graffiti during Black Lives Matter protests in June, the pictures used in the social media posts are from 2000 and 2010.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
