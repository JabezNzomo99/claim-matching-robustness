Linking childhood illnesses such as measles, chicken pox, and mumps to cancer prevention has some history, but has not been proven in a clinical setting, and is therefore unfounded.\n\n\"The human papillomavirus (HPV) is a perfect example of the inaccuracy of this notion. This virus is now known to be the cause of many cancers, including cervical cancer, throat cancers, and sinus cancers. Having the illness (and HPV infection) will predispose you to have one of these cancers. Receiving the HPV vaccine will help prevent these cancers from forming.\"\n\nIn 2014, The Mayo Clinic published a report about a patient with multiple myeloma who went into remission after receiving an experimental therapy using a measles-derived virus. However, this is not the same as a \"naturally occuring\" measles infection.They were using a modified virus that is weakened, similarly, in fact, to a measles vaccine.", "lang": "en"}
