But the Muslim scholar\u2019s words are still present \u2014 including in a video from 30 years ago that was widely spread on social media in recent days, in which she calls for spreading the Islamic faith across America.\n\nBut the video, posted by the verified account of musician Ted Nugent, has gone viral with an erroneous caption wrongly identifying the speaker as \u201cthe new congresswoman from Michigan.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen very closely to the new congresswoman from Michigan what the enemies of America believe especially on Memorial Day so we don\u2019t let them continue to destroy the wonderful American system of individual freedom that so many died for. Dear God in heaven!\u201d his caption reads.\n\nMichigan does have a \u201cnew congresswoman\u201d who is Muslim: Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who became one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress last year. But, as we said, the video doesn\u2019t show Tlaib or any other member of Congress.\n\nThe video of Alkhateeb \u2014 a writer, scholar and founder of the North American Council for Muslim Women \u2014 is from the August 1989 Muslim Americans Political Awareness Conference. The full video of the conference is available on C-SPAN. Tlaib, who was born in 1976, was 13 at the time of Alkhateeb\u2019s speech.\n\nIn the video, Alkhateeb advocates for her peers to \u201clook at all of the other people who are sharing this country with us as potential Muslims\u201d and refers to a \u201clong-range process of making America Muslim, all of America Muslim.\u201d\n\nThe video with the false caption has garnered nearly 100,000 shares and 2.8 million views. Some users wrote comments noting that it was from 1989, but many posted words betraying an apparent belief in the falsehood.\n\n\u201cWhoever is voting for this trash needs to remember what the cowards did on 9/11,\u201d one reads. Another: \u201cAmazing that people like this are not just allowed, but apparently voted into positions of power.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst mistake was letting Obama bring them here!\u201d one man wrote, referring to President Barack Obama. (Alkhateeb was born in Philadelphia and was an American citizen.)\n\nNugent, an ardent supporter of President Donald Trump, has shared misinformation before, including a recent meme about climate change that showcased a fabricated cover of Time magazine.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
