When people vote for a party, they don\u2019t necessarily vote for every single policy that party puts forward; and turnout was relatively low compared to other types of public vote, meaning we don\u2019t know what a sizeable chunk of the electorate actually thinks.\n\nRoughly a third of votes were cast for no deal parties\n\nTwo parties standing in the 2019 EU parliamentary elections in Great Britain seem to support a no deal Brexit as their preferred outcome: the Brexit Party and UKIP.\n\nThe Brexit Party\u2019s pledge card stated: \u201cWe will push for a Brexit on World Trade Organisation terms\u201d, which is the same thing as leaving the EU without a deal.\n\nUKIP\u2019s manifesto committed to \u201cleave the EU under the policy of unilateral and unconditional withdrawal.\u201d\n\nThese two parties won 35% of the vote in Great Britain between them (the Brexit Party got 31.6% and UKIP got 3.3%).\n\n13% of eligible UK voters cast a vote for a party that supports no deal\n\nThe Change UK MP Anna Soubry argues that the votes for no deal actually amount to only 12% of people eligible to vote overall. That\u2019s based on the fact that 37% of eligible voters in the UK voted in the EU elections\u2014so if you include all people who could have voted, only 13% voted for a no deal party (by our calculations).\n\nThat calculation has one flaw though. No deal-supporting parties got 35% of the votes in Great Britain, but the 37% turnout figure is for the UK as a whole\u2014so including Northern Ireland.\n\nVoters in Northern Ireland rank candidates by preference, unlike the system used in the rest of the UK, so it\u2019s harder to say that people chose a single party.\n\nIf you just count Northern Irish voters\u2019 first preferences, for example, you can adjust the calculation about vote shares to be about the whole of the UK. That changes the numbers very slightly: 34% of all UK voters who voted in the EU parliamentary elections voted for a party that seems to favour no deal, meaning about 13% of the total UK electorate voted for a no deal party.\n\nWe probably shouldn\u2019t read too much into the results\n\nThese numbers have been used to make all kinds of points about public attitudes in recent days. There are a couple reasons why we should be careful about reading too much into the data.\n\nFirstly, turnout was relatively low compared to other types of public vote. General elections normally get a turnout of at least 60%, and the EU referendum had a turnout of 72%, whereas turnout in the UK last week was 37%. This means the voters may not be representative of the electorate as a whole. Citizens of other EU countries were also able to vote in this election but would not be able to in a general election.\n\nSecondly, people who voted for the parties that support a no deal Brexit didn\u2019t necessarily vote for them because they supported no deal, at least as their preferred option. For example, a poll by Lord Ashcroft taken just after the election found 67% of those reporting they had voted for the Brexit party said they thought the best Brexit outcome would be leaving the EU with no deal. 23% thought the best outcome would be some form of deal, but not the one negotiated by the government.", "lang": "en"}
