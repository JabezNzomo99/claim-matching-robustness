During the 2008 presidential campaign, PolitiFact rated one campaign ad as because it implied she\u2019d single-handedly \"stood up for universal health care when almost no one else would.\" In another instance, we rated her comment because she qualified her claim, saying she \"helped\" create the children\u2019s health coverage program -- along with others.\n\nIt's correct that the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program -- known as CHIP -- provides health care coverage to more than 8 million children, . Created in 1997, when it was known as the State Children's Health Insurance Program, it promotes health coverage for low-income children by providing federal funding to states.\n\nThe current ad gives Clinton credit for \"winning\" legislation that congressional lawmakers passed when she was first lady.\n\nHer campaign website has a more nuanced statement: \"As first lady, she refused to give up when Congress defeated health care reform. Instead, she worked with Republicans and Democrats to help create the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, which now provides health coverage to more than 8 million children. Senator Ted Kennedy said that if not for Hillary, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program wouldn\u2019t be in existence today.\"\n\nThe late-Sen. Kennedy received much of the credit for CHIP because the Massachusetts Democrat shepherded the legislation through a Republican-controlled Congress. Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch was the lead Republican co-sponsor.\n\nYet, in 2007, Kennedy told the Associated Press that Hillary Clinton played a critical role .\n\n\"The children's health program wouldn't be in existence today if we didn't have Hillary pushing for it from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue,\" Kennedy said.\n\nNick Littlefield, a senior health adviser to Kennedy at the time, agreed.\n\n\"She wasn't a legislator, she didn't write the law, and she wasn't the president, so she didn't make the decisions,\" Littlefield told the Associated Press. \"But we relied on her, worked with her and she was pivotal in encouraging the White House to do it.\"\n\nBut the new Clinton ad has no qualifiers, stating \"she's the one who's proven she can get it done\u2026 winning health care for 8 million children.\"\n\nA Clinton campaign ad says one of her accomplishments was \"winning health care for 8 million children.\"\n\nThat statement is largely accurate. Clinton was key to creating the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, which provides coverage for 8 million children. But the ad leaves out the contributions of others.\n\nBecause of that caveat, we rate her statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
