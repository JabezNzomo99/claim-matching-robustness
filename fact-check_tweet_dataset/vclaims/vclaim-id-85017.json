This ludicrous statement was apparently made by actress Swara Bhasker, according to ShankhNaad. The communal rabble-rousing page put out this quote attributed to her.\n\nThe quote has circulated widely among right-wing twitter handles and Facebook pages. Recently, Bhasker had written an open letter to Sanjay Leela Bhansali, director of the movie Padmaavat and expressed her disagreement and disapproval of the portrayal of the queen and her decision to commit \u2018jauhar\u2019 after Chittor had been besieged by Alauddin Khilji. Bhasker\u2019s view gained much traction on social media. She was attacked for her view by certain sections, some of whom stooped rather low.\n\nMahesh Vikram Hegde is followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on twitter, and is the founder and admin of the fake news website Postcard.news which only recently had shared a fake quote attributed to actor Farhan Akhtar over the communal violence in Kasganj, U.P.\n\nBhasker spoke to Alt News. Expressing outrage, she said \u201cThis meme by ShankhNaad is an utter and blatant lie. I have literally not used these words strung next to each other in any utterance nor anything I\u2019ve ever said or written in public or in private. I think this perverse, wilful twisting of my article and the argument in the article has been done to serve the hateful and poisonous motives of Shanknaad and it reeks of vicious intent.\n\nIt\u2019s scary and shameful that a politely worded review of a film should be twisted for such sinister purposes. I think this amounts to criminal defamation\u201d.\n\nForced on the backfoot and threatened with lawsuit, ShankhNaad deleted the tweet containing the quote and issued a \u2018clarification\u2019 and an \u2018apology\u2019, hiding behind \u2018technicalities\u2019.\n\nFor those who are aware of the kind of inflammatory content that ShankhNaad shares, such mischief is not surprising and sadly, not unexpected. This is because no action has been taken against the page and its owner despite being repeatedly exposed over its blatantly communal agenda, posting malicious content with regularity and impunity.", "lang": "en"}
