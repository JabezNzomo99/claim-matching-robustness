Would the FBI director actually tell someone they were not a target of such investigation before all of the facts had been gathered?\n\nTrump is not necessarily a reliable source for private conversations. He claimed that Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) had told him privately that \u201cyou will go down as one of the great presidents in the history of our country.\u201d But Cummings insisted that he had been misquoted. He said that what he actually told Trump was \u201che could be a great president if \u2026 if \u2026 he takes steps to truly represent all Americans rather than continuing on the divisive and harmful path he is currently on.\u201d\n\nIndeed, The Washington Post reported: \u201cPeople familiar with the matter said that [Trumps\u2019s Comey] statement is not accurate, although they would not say how it was inaccurate.\u201d The Wall Street Journal quoted an unnamed associate of Comey as saying \u201cthat is literally farcical.\u201d\n\nBut Trump told NBC News on May 11 that Comey told him three times he wasn\u2019t under investigation, once in a phone call initiated by the president. He said the conversations took place once over dinner, and twice in phone calls. \u201cI said, \u2018If it\u2019s possible would you let me know am I under investigation?\u2019 He said \u2018You are not under investigation\u2019.\u2019\u2019\n\nComey has not commented, but The Fact Checker contacted former attorneys general and FBI directors about whether this was an appropriate conversation. We have two comments so far and will update as we receive more answers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it in fact happened. It\u2019s hard for me to think of a situation where it might be appropriate,\u201d Gonzales said. He said that, if asked by the president about such a probe, the best response would be: \u201cI can\u2019t answer that question and it would be wise for us to not have this discussion.\u201d He said that because the investigation had not been completed, \u201chow would he [Comey] know where he would end up with the investigation?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President is the chief law enforcement officer and it is perfectly appropriate for the Attorney General to discuss cases with the President that don\u2019t touch on the President himself,\u201d Barr said. \u201cFor example, I discussed the Pan Am 103 case with the President.\u201d But he added: \u201cI don\u2019t know the scope or current thrust of the Russian investigation. Comey would know.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
