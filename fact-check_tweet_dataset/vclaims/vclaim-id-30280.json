A relatively small percentage of Iranians participate in these chants, which is mainly of symbolic use for the government. \u201cOver the decades, I\u2019ve heard \u2018Death to America!\u2019 shouted routinely at Friday prayers, and at commemorations of the U.S. Embassy takeover and other demonstrations,\u201d our former colleague Robin Wright wrote in the New Yorker in 2015. \u201cThe regime refuses to shelve the slogan. These days, however, students are often bused in on anniversaries as crowd-filler; the perk is a day off from school. They chant when prompted. The enthusiasm is a bit like the anti-American graffiti on public walls \u2014 it hasn\u2019t been painted over, but it\u2019s fading.\u201d\n\nWhen the nuclear deal was negotiated, many experts warned that lifting sanctions on Iran would free up more money for militant groups funded by Iran. Obama administration officials said they expected Iran\u2019s activities in the region would increase and they were prepared to take action through sanctions and other methods. \u201cAs we expected, Iran has not moderated this conduct since the implementation of the JCPOA,\u201d a senior Treasury official said in 2016. \u201cAnd, as we promised, we have continued to target this behavior, with interdictions, with diplomatic pressure, and with sanctions.\u201d\n\nMoreover, one specific criticism of the deal was that it did not cover Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program. Iran insisted the deal was limited to the nuclear program, not its missile program. Limits on Iran\u2019s ballistic missiles thus have been handled under U.N. Security Council resolutions, including the one that implemented the deal. The Post recently reported that Iran has made unexpected gains in the accuracy of its missiles, as a result of changes ordered more than a decade ago by the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. But whether those improvements can also be tied to the Iran deal is unclear.", "lang": "en"}
