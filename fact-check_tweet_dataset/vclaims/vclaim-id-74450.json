A screenshot of a tweet ascribed to her was tweeted by a user Shash(@pokershash) which has now been deleted. The screenshot read, \u201cThis is what hate looks like. The wise and always open to dialogue a Muslim Lawyer attacked by so called Maulana of Muslims. She is 60 years old. This is HEARTBREAKING. Along with ALL the halala this too is on u @INCIndia\u201d. The tweet accumulated 57 retweets and 169 likes before it was deleted.\n\nBhasker rubbished the statement credited to her tweeting, \u201cMy original tweet. (On left about Swami Agnivesh being attacked) and the Fake News Factory adapting it.. to the Slapgate issue.. guys u are SO creative!\u201c.\n\nShash(@pokershash) tried to save face by deleting the tweet without an apology. Later, the account tweeted the same screenshot mocking Bhasker, \u201cEveryone knows that it\u2019s fake coz you just can\u2019t condemn violence on a woman by a muslim. It\u2019s funny that your idea of women empowerment is limited only to pathbreaking.\u201d\n\nA photoshopped tweet of Swara Bhasker had been circulated in the past as well. Posted below is the tweet which carried the morphed screenshot of Bhasker\u2019s tweet,\n\nWhereas the original tweet of Bhasker was nowhere close to what was portrayed.\n\nEarlier, A fake quote regarding the movie Padmaavat was ascribed to Swara Bhasker in January 2018 by serial fake news purveyor ShakhNaad after she had written an open letter to director Sanjay Leela Bhansali about the movie. ShankhNaad is known for its chronic tendency of sharing misinformation. In a statement given to Alt News, she had refuted the claim, calling it \u201cperverse and wilful twisting of my article\u201d.\n\nAscribing false statements to politically vocal public figures is not a new phenomenon. Alt News has observed that public figures who refuse to toe the popular line are specifically targeted by the right-wing ecosystem on social media.", "lang": "en"}
