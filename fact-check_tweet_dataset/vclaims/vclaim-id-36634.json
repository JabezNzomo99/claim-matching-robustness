Nor does it appear on any of the outlet\u2019s other platforms.\n\nThe viral post attributes to an unnamed MSNBC journalist a statement expressing hope that the COVID-19 outbreak will hurt President Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection chances. At press time, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus has killed more than 7,800 people, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\n\u201cMSNBC Actually Said on the air \u2018I hope enough people die from CoronaVirus that it harms Trump\u2019s re-election,'\u201d reads the post. \u201cNo shame.\u201d (RELATED: Viral Image Claims A Lysol Product Label Proves The Coronavirus Isn\u2019t A \u2018New Virus\u2019)\n\nThere is, however, no evidence that an MSNBC reporter ever made the statement on-air or elsewhere on the media outlet\u2019s platforms. A search of video clip editing service Grabien turned up no matches for the quote. It does not appear on MSNBC\u2019s website or social media accounts.\n\nControversial statements by journalists often make headlines when they happen on live news broadcasts. If an MSNBC television personality had made the remark, it would have been picked up by the media, yet no news outlets have reported on it.\n\nAccording to Snopes, the claim may have originated with a heavily edited video of MSNBC anchor Nicole Wallace and a Princeton University professor in which they made comparisons to Hurricane Katrina. The edited clip, Snopes reported, made it seem like the reporters were making light of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nVariations of the fake quote have continued to crop up on social media, despite no record of an MSNBC journalist ever making the statement.", "lang": "en"}
