The cap would be allowed to grow each year with the inflation rate, which would take into account any growth in cost or population. He also would require a co-pay for recipients with incomes above the poverty level.\n\nChristie\u2019s PAC, Leadership Matters for America, pointed to gross domestic product figures from the World Bank and Medicaid spending figures from the Office of Management and Budget data. Those figures show GDP grew by 231 percent from 1987 to 2012, and Medicaid spending grew by 814 percent from $27.4 billion in 1987 to $250.5 billion in 2012. (Christie\u2019s Medicaid spending was not adjusted for inflation, which would decrease that percent growth to about 500 percent.)\n\nThe most reliable way to compare the growth in Medicaid spending over a 25-year period is to compare it as a percentage of the GDP, as that method adjusts for inflation and population growth. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services manages historical data, which show that in federal expenditures for Medicaid were nearly 0.6 percent of the GDP in 1987. In 2012, they represented 1.5 percent of the GDP. (Medicaid expenditures are projected to continue to grow as a percentage of the economy in coming years.)\n\nHealth-care costs generally increase faster than the economy. Medicaid has increased at a significantly faster pace than the U.S. economy, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The general increase in health-care costs has slowed down in the past decade or so \u2014 and at a slower rate than previously projected \u2014 but it is still running above general inflation and economic growth, experts said.\n\nWhile the elderly and disabled population makes up a relatively small portion of total enrollees, they comprise about two-third of Medicaid spending. That means a significant amount of the growth in Medicaid spending has been the aging Baby Boomer population, and the increased long-term expenses due to the aging population or enrollees with disabilities. The most expensive part of the program \u2014 and the main expenditure for this population \u2014 goes toward nursing homes, home care and home health aides. (Part of this cost is shared by Medicare, which is the dual eligibility that Christie wants to change.)\n\nMedicaid is affected by cycles in the economy. During the recession that began in 2007, millions of people lost jobs and income \u2014 and gained Medicaid eligibility. Recession-related spike in enrollees was the key driver of Medicaid spending between 2007 and 2013, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Enrollment growth has slowed since 2010, after economic recovery began. But many low-income enrollees continue to feel the impact of the low recovery.\n\nThe demand for services like Medicaid grew during the recession, yet states had less revenue to pay for them. That meant the federal government had to increase its matching rate so that states would pay a lesser share of the cost \u2014 which took further toll on federal spending.\n\nOn a per-person basis, Medicaid spending grew at a much slower rate compared to the overall program cost and private insurance. Spending on prescription drugs and long-term institutional care declined, because many of the costs were spread out into managed care contracts and community-based services. Medicaid has cost less than private insurance to cover comparable enrollees for 20 to 30 years, said Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which has disputed claims by critics of entitlement programs.\n\nMany states also have decided to expand Medicaid eligibility \u2014 including Christie\u2019s own state in 2013, when Christie became one of the few Republican governors to align himself President Obama on the Affordable Care Act. Christie had said he was making the best decision for his state, and that accepting federal funds to expand the program would save money for the state\u2019s taxpayers.\n\nWhile it is correct that Medicaid spending has grown disproportionately to the size of the economy, Christie\u2019s numbers give a misleading impression of the magnitude. We attempted to engage his representatives about his calculations, but they did not answer our follow-up questions. While Christie says he was not a math major, that is not an excuse to throw out this misleading comparison. We recommend he use the growth in Medicaid spending as a percentage of the GDP. Reciting raw numbers from the federal budget is quite misleading, when looking at growth over a quarter century.\n\nLet us remember that the astronomical growth in spending on Medicaid nursing home care is an unintended, long-term consequence of lawmakers who sought to keep the program limited and focused on \u201cpoor mamas and babies\u201d in rural and southern states, rather than to large industrial states. One of The Fact Checker\u2019s favorite examples of good intentions gone awry is an article by former Lyndon Johnson aide Joseph A. Califano Jr., which we have embedded below. It\u2019s a good reminder to politicians like Christie to be careful when proposing ideas to overhaul large federal programs like Medicaid \u2014 lest they result in effects that end up being more costly than intended.", "lang": "en"}
