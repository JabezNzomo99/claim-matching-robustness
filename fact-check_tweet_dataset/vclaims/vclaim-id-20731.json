No, that's not true. The man is really on fire but according to news reports he did it to himself with a flammable liquid and it happened in Agadir, Morocco.\n\nAn example of the video being shared with a wrong caption is this post published on June 6, 2018 on a Facebook page \"Catholics Online\" (archived here) which had the video captioned as:\n\nHere's an example of the video on YouTube (archived here):\n\nHowever, a site named Morocco World News claims it happened in Agadir and that it was self-inflicted:\n\nWe analyzed the video and to us it seems clear that the size of the flames is much bigger than one would expect from a smoldering phone in a pocket.\n\nWe also spotted two logo's in the video: something that looks like an \"M\" with a yellow circle and the word \"Diamantine\".\n\nWe looked up \"Diamantine\" in Agadir on Google Maps and we found a branch was in the same building as a supermarked named \"Marjane\":\n\nWhich happens to have a logo that consists of an \"M\" with a yellow circle:\n\nSo it definitely looks like the \"Agadir\" version of the story is the correct one, also because Dubai police have put out notice it didn't happen over there:\n\nDubai Police Have Confirmed This Shocking Video Of A Man On Fire DID NOT Happen In Dubai Mall A reminder to everyone not to spread unverified news If you spotted this video doing the rounds on WhatsApp over the last few days, you weren't the only one who was genuinely shocked. The video shows a man, engulfed by flames, trying to remove his clothes while people frantically rush around him trying to help.", "lang": "en"}
