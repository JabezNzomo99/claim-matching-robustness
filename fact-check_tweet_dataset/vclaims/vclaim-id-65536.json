According to the report, the incident took place in Barmer, Rajasthan.\n\n\u201cWe took cognisance of the video. Upon primary investigation, it was revealed that the matter is related to Chohtan police station and both the victim and the perpetrators were from the same family. The two parties had reached a compromise later on and, therefore, had not lodged a complaint with the police,\u201d ANI quoted Superintendent of Police (SP) Barmer, Anand Sharma as saying.\n\n\u201cWe have sent the SHO to the spot. A case will be registered and action will be taken against the culprits. Primary investigations have revealed that the matter is related to an affair with a woman. But we have received no such complaint yet,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile investigating further, we found a tweet by Barmer Police dated July 31, 2020. In response to a similar claim, the police clarified that the case has nothing to do with the caste and it\u2019s a family affair.\n\n\u201cIn this video, it is falsely stated that a Dalit person was tortured by the dominant caste. Whereas, in reality, the incident took place 5 days ago over a family dispute. Taking cognizance, police filed an FIR and took 6 people into custody, \u201d the tweet read in Hindi.\n\nHence, based on the above information, it can be concluded that the video is being shared with a misleading claim.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
