And not only has [this one] not failed but thrived and has won major national awards that are only given to one philanthropic organization per year that come with six-figure checks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of anyone [in the GOP field] who\u2019s put together a nonprofit that, as you know, nine out of 10 fail. Ours not only has succeeded but has won major national awards that are only given to one organization in the country. You know, that requires a lot of organizational skill and know-how.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are people who say, \u2018But you can\u2019t do this. You don\u2019t have any experience.\u2019 \u2026 But I do have a lot of experience in solving problems, complex surgical problems that have never been done by anybody before. \u2026 Candy and I do have experience starting a national nonprofit scholars fund. Nine out of 10 of those fail. Ours is thriving in all 50 states, and has won several national awards.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly what Carson means by \u201cfail,\u201d or if he is basing this claim on data. Carson\u2019s campaign did not respond to our requests for comment. Carson often makes it seem as though this is a widely accepted statistic (\u201cAs you know, nine out of 10 nonprofits fail\u201d). We consulted several experts in nonprofit management, but they were unaware of data that support this statistic.\n\nThe Urban Institute\u2019s National Center for Charitable Statistics is the main source of nonprofit-sector data in the United States, and analyzes federally tax-exempt nonprofit organizations\u2019 filings to the Internal Revenue Service. Organizations are required to report revenue, expenses and assets on IRS Form 990 or 990-EZ. Smaller nonprofits that have $50,000 or less in gross receipts do not have financial reporting requirements, and file a Form 990-N e-Postcard instead.\n\nNCCS program director Thomas Pollak pointed us to the data he provided FactCheck.org: There were 50,089 nonprofits (public charities, private foundations and other organizations) that obtained tax-exempt status in 2005. Of them, 32,063, or 64 percent, are still listed on the most recent IRS list of registered nonprofits. And 13,780 of them, or 28 percent, reported financial activity in their most recent IRS file. These are the standard measures of whether a nonprofit is active.\n\nAn apples-to-apples comparison would be comparing public charity scholarship funds (such as Carson Scholars). NCCS data on nonprofits classified in the \u201cScholarships and Student Financial Aid\u201d category showed that 491 such nonprofits were created in 1994. Of them, 249 (51 percent) were still on the most recent IRS list of registered nonprofits, and 113 (23 percent) reported financial activity. So, even in the most specific, narrow version of this data, nearly one in four of nonprofits like Carson\u2019s created in the same year are still active.\n\nOne expert told us Carson may be referring to nonprofits that fail to achieve financial sustainability, or fail to reach scale. But such concepts go beyond what it means for any organization, nonprofit or for-profit, to fail, Pollak said. For example, an organization may lose money for 10 years in a row but if it is still active, it hasn\u2019t necessarily \u201cfailed.\u201d\n\nThe Nonprofit Finance Fund\u2019s 2015 State of the Nonprofit Sector survey showed that 52 percent of 5,451 respondents in 50 states and Puerto Rico reported that they did not have resources necessary to meet the demand for services in 2014. Of the respondents, 47 percent had an operating surplus at the end of fiscal 2014 and 24 percent had a deficit. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are not sustainable. \u201cOrganizations can be sustainable, but still not be able to keep up with rising demand for services in their community,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nBut just because an organization is not filing a Form 990 or 990-EZ with the IRS anymore does not necessarily mean it \u201cfailed.\u201d The IRS removes organizations from its list of tax-exempt groups after three consecutive years of not filing. It may be that the organization grew smaller, and is now filing the e-Postcard instead of a full financial reporting form. Plus, this three-year requirement was enacted in 2006, because many groups had remained on the rolls despite having dissolved years ago. Cohen said this provision has not been effective long enough to gather enough data showing a trend of how many nonprofits survive.\n\nWhat about the exclusive, major national awards Carson touts? A spokesman for Carson Scholars said the candidate is referring to the William E. Simon Award for Philanthropic Leadership that Carson received in 2005. Indeed, this is a major national award given to a philanthropist, with $250,000 that can be given to any charity. Carson donated his award to Carson Scholars.\n\nBut his specific statistic that \u201cnine out of 10 nonprofits fail\u201d is not supported by IRS data. There are many ways to slice the nonprofit categories, but even the most narrow comparison of public charity scholarship funds such as Carson Scholars to those that were created in 1994 have a survival rate of 23 percent and 51 percent \u2014 not nearly as abysmal as Carson makes it sound.", "lang": "en"}
