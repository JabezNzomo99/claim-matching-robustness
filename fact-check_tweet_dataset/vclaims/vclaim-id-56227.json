The video shows an incident that took place in Deoria, Uttar Pradesh on March 28, 2018 and does not involve any communal angle. The victim Shamshad Ahmed was thrashed after he asked the main accused Nasir Ansari to return the money he had lent him. BOOM had previously fact-checked the same video in 2018 and 2019.", "lang": "en"}
