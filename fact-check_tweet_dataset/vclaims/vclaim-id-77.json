First however, we will go through your social media history from the last 4 years and search for any posts with #NotMyPresident in it. I wouldn't think of offending you with a check if I'm not your president! #MAGA\" ( here )\n\nWhile most comments indicated that users understood this was a hoax, other remarks suggested otherwise. \u201cWell said Mr President!!!\u201d and \u201cHe\u2019s my president very proud to say! Loving him more everyday\u201d were among comments left by users alongside the post.\n\nThe tweet originates from a satirical Facebook account, \"Real Fake Tweets\". The Facebook account creates fake tweets. The page's cover photograph says, \"Disclaimer: All content on this page is fake and meant to be satirical. Do not believe anything you read here, no matter how bad you want it to be true.\" The page's About Me section says, \"My goal is to make a fake tweet so realistic, it gets investigated by Snopes.\" The page admins confirmed to Reuters that they created the fake tweet circulating in this claim ( here ).\n\nScreenshots of the tweet have been shared and reposted on social media without linking back to the \u201cReal Fake Tweets\u201d page.\n\nThis tweet makes reference to President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u2019s proposal to mail out checks to every American of up to $1,000 as support during the coronavirus crisis. The idea came from Senator Mitt Romney, who proposed that every American should get $1,000 to help them until government aid arrives, which gained bipartisan support. ( here )\n\nThis policy is similar to a measure adopted during the Great Recession of 2008. The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 provided payments averaging $600 per person, injecting more than $100 billion into the economy within a matter of months. The payment was deposited by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service into the bank accounts of those who filed their taxes online and came as paper checks to others.\n\nThe proposal would give $1,000 to every American, as the coronavirus outbreak has prevented many from working and being able to pay their bills. It is not contingent on political support for the President.\n\nThis tweet by President Donald Trump does not exist, it was created by a Facebook page for satirical purposes.\n\nFalse: President Trump did not tweet that those who had used the hashtag #NotMyPresident on social media would not receive a payment designed to help Americans struggling during the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
