BBC spoke to one of its correspondents from Islamabad who informed that the video pertains to an incident that took place in Faisalabad in Pakistan\u2019s Punjab province in 2013.\n\nPakistani media Dunya News, Geo TVand The Express Tribunehad reported the event where citizens were thrashed by personnel of Pakistan\u2019s \u2018Elite Forces\u2019.\n\nAccording to Dunya News, \u201c\u2026during a protest against electricity load-shedding in Faisalabad, police entered the houses of protesters and manhandled their women.\u201d\n\nBBC Islamabad correspondent Umar Daraz informed that Faisalabad is prone to electricity shortages but in 2013 the situation turned dire. People took to the streets in protests after complaining of power outages for 14-16 hours a day.\n\n\u201cThey had resorted to throwing stones and had also burned down a FESCO office, after which police officers abused and assaulted the protesters,\u201d per a June 2013 Express Tribunereport. Three police personnel Babar Masih, Tauseef Ahmed, Abid Hussain were suspended after police excess on Muslim families.\n\nAlt News had debunked the video in January 2019 when it was shared with a different false claim. The video has been doing rounds with distorted facts in other countries as well. A Persian website \u2018Shia News Association\u2019 in 2014 claimed that it depicted Pakistani police excess on Afghan refugees. In 2015, the video was circulated with the claim that it portrayed Pakistani police brutality on Christians. From a YouTube handle \u2018Peace Worldwide\u2019, it attracted over 95,000 views. A Twitter user from Europe, who is followed by Railway Minister Piyush Goyal\u2019s Office, also shared the identical video with the \u2018Christian\u2019 narrative, but in 2017.\n\nSince the revocation of key provisions of Article 370, social media has been brimming with all kinds of misinformation. From the Pakistani social media ecosystem, there has been a visible attempt to portray brutality on Kashmiris. Alt News has debunked a plethora of such claims.", "lang": "en"}
