This included a claim on the state of Scottish accident and emergency waiting times in the NHS, which has been a point of contention between rival parties at Holyrood in recent years.\n\nA google search shows this claim has been regularly repeated by SNP politicians in the press.\n\nThe Ferret Fact Service looked at the evidence, and found that the SNP\u2019s claim that Scotland has the best accident and emergency waiting times in the UK is accurate, but there is more to the story.\n\nEach country in the UK publishes monthly NHS usage statistics, with a breakdown of how many people use different areas and how long people have waited before being treated.\n\nThe SNP can point to the UK-wide monthly target for accident and emergency patients to be seen within four hours of coming to the hospital.\n\nOn this measure, Scotland\u2019s performance outstrips the other UK nations. The latest comparable figures, which cover January, show Scotland had 128,648 attendances at A&E of which 91.8 per cent were \u201cseen and resulted in a subsequent admission, transfer or discharge within 4 hours.\u201d\n\nIn England, January\u2019s figures show 85.1 per cent of patients were seen within four hours, while in Wales, 79 per cent were seen within the target time. Northern Ireland\u2019s results are published quarterly, with the most recent figures from December 2016 showing just 69.9 per cent (compared to Scotland\u2019s 92.6%) were treated and discharged or admitted within four hours.\n\nThese trends have continued for nearly two years, with June 2015 the last time Scotland\u2019s four-hour percentage was outstripped by another UK nation (England).\n\nThere is some debate over whether the measurement of four-hour care is a good reflection of real waiting times.\n\nSeveral reports have noted the limitations of the measure, and there is some evidence that a drive to avoid missing the target can lead to unnecessary admissions into hospital.\n\nIt is not sensitive to differences in waiting times within the four-hour period. For example, a health board where most patients are seen within an hour could have a similar \u2018four hour measure\u2019 percentage to an area where the majority of people wait nearly four hours.\n\nThe target also does not take into account the time taken to treat someone, as it refers to the entire period a patient spends in A&E rather than just the time spent \u2018waiting\u2019.\n\nTherefore, the four-hour figures do not \u201cprovide a full measure of service quality\u201d or give an exact reflection of waiting times, but instead act as an indicator of broad A&E performance.\n\nA House of Commons Health Committee report concluded that \u201ckey indicators of hospital performance should be based on a broader assessment of patient outcome and experience\u201d.\n\nIt is important to note that the Scottish Government\u2019s own target, which matches the wider UK NHS approach for four-hour waiting times, is 95%. The last time this was successfully achieved was in July 2016, meaning for seven consecutive months waiting times have failed to meet the national standard.\n\nThe SNP is correct to say that under the national standard of four-hour waiting times Scotland is the best performing nation in the United Kingdom. However, this common measure used to grade A&E performance may not give a full account of actual waiting times, and the Scottish Government has been less successful when judged against its own targets.\n\nIn response to an FFS request for evidence, the SNP provided a comparative parliamentary briefing on NHS waiting times across the UK.\n\nPhotos thanks to Skitterphoto and Pete, CC0 Public Domain", "lang": "en"}
