Parton said to the best of her recollection and records, she wrote \u201cJolene\u201d and \u201cI Will Always Love You\u201d in one day (although a tweet posted online stated that she said she did so in one night).\n\nIn the interview, host Bones asked, \u201cTell me about this,\u201d before playing a portion of \u201cI Will Always Love You.\u201d He then inquired, \u201cYou wrote the song. How long ago?\u201d\n\nParton responded, \u201cIn 1972, I think I wrote it. At the same time I wrote \u2018Jolene.\u2019 That was a good writing day.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wrote them in the same day?\u201d Bones asked, to which Parton answered, \u201cYeah, I believe so, it was right in that period of time because I remember all my paperwork, and like they came out pretty close at the same time. So everybody said, what was you taking, that was a good writing day\u201d:\n\nParton explained that she wrote the \u201cI Will Always Love You\u201d when she was on the verge of striking out on her own and leaving the Porter Wagoner Show, a process she described as emotional and difficult. She also said the song didn\u2019t gain international fame until 20 years after she wrote it, when Whitney Houston covered it for the soundtrack to the 1992 movie \u201cThe Bodyguard.\u201d\n\nBones noted that the song has withstood the test of time and has been covered and resurrected by each generation since it was written. The same appears to be true for \u201cJolene,\u201d which pop superstar Miley Cyrus recently covered.\n\nWe are labeling this claim \u201cTrue\u201d because, to the best of Parton\u2019s recollection and records, she wrote both songs on the same \u201cwriting day.\u201d It\u2019s not an outlandish claim, and the length it takes to write a song doesn\u2019t dictate its popularity, as demonstrated by the reported 15 minutes it took Mariah Carey and producer Walter Afanasieff to pen the wildly popular holiday song \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
