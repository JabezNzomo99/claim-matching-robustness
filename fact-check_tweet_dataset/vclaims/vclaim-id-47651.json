The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that as of May 1, 2020, there are 1,062,446 COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and 62,406 deaths.\n\nSocial media users wasted no time posting comments directed at Mitchell, reminding him of his statement.\n\n \n\n Because the tweet in question was published from Mitchell\u2019s Twitter account, we rate this claim \u201cCorrect Attribution.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
