It was an historic moment, though some bloggers have used the occasion to rewrite history instead.\n\n\"The McCarran-Walter Act of 1952 bans Muslims from holding public office in the United States,\" reads a Facebook post from Jan. 6.\n\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

It\u2019s named for Pat McCarran, then a Democratic senator from Nevada, and Francis Walter, then a Democratic representative from Pennsylvania. Both men worried about communists infiltrating the country through the immigration system, and they wanted to limit who could come to the United States.\n\nThe resulting McCarthy era-law codified an existing quota system for immigration. It also introduced a new system that gave preferences to some immigrants based on their skill sets and whether they would be reunited with their families. As the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Office of the Historian notes, the new act revised the 1924 National Origins Quota System by admitting people of different nationalities to the United States at a rate of one-sixth of 1 percent of however many immigrants from a country were living in the United States in 1920.\n\nThat meant that 85 percent of about 154,000 visas available annually went to people from northern and western European lineage. President Harry Truman worried that the law was discriminatory, but Congress had enough votes to override his veto.\n\nStill, the law does not mention religion nor Muslims. And as other fact-checkers found last year, the claim that it bars Muslims from holding office is incorrect.\n\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
