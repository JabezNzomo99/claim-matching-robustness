When this rate was subsequently reduced in 2013-14, individuals delayed income from previous years. Individuals received notice of this change a year in advance. These changes heavily impacted on receipts over the period.\u201d\n\nHMRC also says that changes to the economy have had an impact on the amount of tax received.\n\nWho are the \u201csuper-rich\u201d?\n\nThe report uses HMRC\u2019s definition of a \u201chigh net worth individual\u201d, as anyone with wealth of more than \u00a320 million including all their property, stocks and savings and excluding any debts.\n\nHMRC said there were 6,500 high net worth individuals in the UK at the start of 2015/16. That's 0.02% of taxpayers, according to the NAO.\n\nHMRC has recently revised the definition to include anyone with wealth over \u00a310 million. That adds another 2,000 people to the \u201csuper-rich\u201d category.\n\nThe amount of income tax paid by high net worth individuals fell from \u00a34.4 billion in 2009/10 to \u00a33.5 billion in 2014/15, according to the NAO.\n\nBut the NAO also give a note of caution. It says HMRC put some of the changes in the tax collected down to changes in the economy and to rate of income tax collected.\n\nThe NAO says \u201cHMRC\u2019s analysis of income tax liabilities over this time has found that the tax paid on income over \u00a3150,000 is: higher than it would otherwise have been in 2009-10 as people brought forward income to that year; lower than it would otherwise have been following the introduction of the 50% rate between 2010-11 and 2012-13; and higher again in 2013-14\u2014when the rate was reduced to 45%\u2014as people delayed income from previous years.\u201d\n\nSo we don\u2019t know what the trend of income tax receipts would have been without these unusual shifts in incomes following the rate changes since 2010 and in the economy.\n\nThat means comparing the tax take in 2009/10 to 2014/15 isn\u2019t a fair comparison.\n\nIncome tax receipts have increased for taxpayers overall\n\nA committee of MPs looking into taxes collected from the super-rich noted that, at the same time as income tax receipts from high net worth individuals fell by 20%, income tax from all taxpayers increased by 9% or \u00a323 billion. In their response to the committee HMRC said the changes to the economy and tax rates were behind this.\n\nHMRC set up a specialist unit dedicated to collecting tax from high net worth individuals in 2009.\n\nHMRC told the committee it estimated that the unit raised \u00a3416 million more than was voluntarily declared by high net worth individuals.", "lang": "en"}
