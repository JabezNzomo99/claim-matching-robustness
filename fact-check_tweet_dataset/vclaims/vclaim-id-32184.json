This is misleading; the China National Center for Biotechnology Development confirmed the drug has \u201ca certain curative effect on the novel coronavirus\u201d, but did not say it cured 12,552 patients. The drug has only been used in clinical trials with \u201cover 100 patients\u201d.\n\nThe news article, which has been shared hundreds of times on Facebook, alleges that chloroquine has been \u201cfound effective against coronavirus\u201d and has cured \u201c12,552 patients in China\u201d alone. The article adds that \u201cChina\u2019s National Health Commission, on Tuesday (February 18), says no fewer than 12,552 have recovered in Chinese mainland out of 72,528 confirmed cases of Coronavirus (COVID-19) in that country.\u201d\n\nWe've archived some of the shares here and here.\n\nAs the leading country in the world for malaria cases, Nigeria accounted for 25 percent of global malaria cases in 2018. For this reason, the anti-malaria drug chloroquine phosphate -- although banned in 2005 and again in 2017 -- is a very popular drug in the country.\n\nOn Monday, when the Chinese authorities listed chloroquine as one of the drugs with \u201ca certain curative effect\u201d on COVID-19, the drug began to trend on Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nAfter the outbreak began at the end of last year, Chinese scientists began to evaluate \u201cthe antiviral efficiency\u201d of existing drugs on COVID-19. They tested several drugs, including chloroquine.\n\nThe scientists said in a paper published on February 4, 2020, that the drugs were tested against \u201ca clinical isolate of 2019-nCoV in vitro\u201d (outside the human body).\n\n\u201cOur findings reveal that remdesivir and chloroquine are highly effective in the control of 2019-nCoV infection in vitro,\u201d the scientists wrote. \u201cWe suggest that they should be assessed in human patients suffering from the novel coronavirus disease\u201d, they added.\n\nThe drug was eventually put to clinical trials, according to the Chinese state news agency, Xinhua.\n\nXinhua reported on Monday that \u201cChinese experts, based on the result of clinical trials, have confirmed that Chloroquine Phosphate, an antimalarial drug, has a certain curative effect on the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\u201d.\n\nXinhua added that Sun Yanrong, deputy head of the China National Center for Biotechnology Development under the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), said the experts \u201csuggested the drug be included in the next version of the treatment guidelines\u201d.\n\nYanrong said \u201cover 100 patients enrolled in the clinical trials\u201d have shown no serious adverse reactions to the drug.\n\nThe drug and two others -- Favilavir and Gilead\u2019s experimental drug remdesivir -- are now being tested in clinical trials.\n\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 , which began in December 2019, has killed more than 2,200 people and infected more than 75,500 in China as of February 21, 2020.", "lang": "en"}
