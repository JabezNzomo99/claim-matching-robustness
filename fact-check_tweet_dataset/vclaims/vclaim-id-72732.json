The claim is false, the photograph actually shows an ice sculpture from an art exhibition at the Helsinki Zoo in Finland in 2011.\n\nThe photograph, which has been shared more than 1,000 times since it was posted on Facebook January 15, 2019, has a caption saying: \u201cFrozen spider Web.\u201d\n\n\"That's a big web. Yikes,\" wrote one user in comments under the post.\n\n\"If you think you hate running into spider webs in the summer, consider this,\" another Facebook user wrote.\n\nSimilar posts using the same image have been shared on social media for years, for example here on Facebook in 2015, and here on Twitter in 2016.\n\nA reverse image search led AFP to this image uploaded by Sami Uskela on Flickr on February 20, 2011.\n\nThe full size clearly shows that the purportedly frozen spider web is actually a freestanding ice sculpture, with a spider carved at the bottom.\n\nThe picture was being widely shared on Facebook at the time, prompting Flickr users to ask Uskela if it was their image.\n\n\u201cYes, I have taken the picture. Thanks for noticing,\u201d Uskela wrote in comments under the image.\n\nFurther reverse image searches linked Uskela's photograph to another picture of the same ice sculpture uploaded to the Flickr account of the Helsinki Zoo on April 20, 2011.\n\nThe Helsinki Zoo confirmed that the Flickr account belonged to them and that the photo showed an ice sculpture not a real spider web.\n\n\"The link to our Flickr account was correct and the icy web is from an ice sculpture competition held at the zoo,\" Helsinki Zoo's information officer Taru Vuori told AFP.\n\n\"I know that the photo or some similar ones, have their own life. With cropped pictures some posts in the social media falsly claim it is a real frozen spider web,\" Vuori added.\n\nAccording to the description on Flickr of the image, taken by photographer Maarit Hohteri, the sculpture, which is called \u201cUltimate Dedication\u201d, was created by Timo Koivisto and Michael Kaloki during the Art Meets Ice competition in 2011.\n\nThe Art Meets Ice competition was held at the Helsinki Zoo in February 2011.\n\nHere is a photo of Timo Koivisto and Michael Kaloki standing in front of the sculpture, which was also posted by the Helsinki Zoo on their Flickr account.\n\nMichael Kaloki has previously represented Kenya in snow sculpting at the Quebec Winter Carnival, according to this BBC article from 2003.", "lang": "en"}
