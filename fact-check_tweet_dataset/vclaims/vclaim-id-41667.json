This was featured in multiple news reports.\n\nJoy Arakkal is an NRI Petroleum refiner who owns one of the largest mansions in Kerala. He, however, has no links to the jewellery brand, Joyalukkas.\n\nAccording to the official website of the jewellery house, the owner of Joyalukkas is Joy Alukkas.\n\nThis proves that the information in the above posts is a case of misidentification. Hence, the claim is misleading and false.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
