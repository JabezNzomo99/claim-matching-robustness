The claim is false; the video clip has been edited from a television report about an April 2018 incident; the World Health Organization, Pakistan\u2019s Health Department, and Peshawar\u2019s health minister have all said that no children died in the province as a result of the polio vaccine.\n\nThe video was published in this Facebook post on April 23, 2019, where it has been viewed more than 220,000 times and shared more than 10,000 times.\n\nThe Urdu language caption translates to English as: \u201cThree children have died in Peshawar due to polio (vaccine).\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post carries a video of a \"breaking news\" bulletin for Pakistani news channel Abb Takk TV.\n\nAt 0:04, the female newsreader says in Urdu: \u201cIn Peshawar three children died and five others were in critical condition after allegedly being given expired polio injections.\u201d\n\nThe video includes visuals of two men carrying the bodies of two children and people offering funeral prayers.\n\nThe misleading Facebook post was posted soon after a series of attacks on polio vaccinators in Pakistan. This is an AFP report published on April 27, 2019, about the attacks.\n\nThe same video has also been shared on Facebook here and here with an identical claim.\n\nThe claim is misleading; the video clip has actually been taken from an old television report -- a keyword search found the exact same video published here on April 30, 2018 on the official YouTube channel for Abb Takk TV.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading Facebook posts (L) and the video on the Abb Takk TV YouTube channel (R)\n\nThe video was also included in this report published on April 30, 2018 on the Abb Takk TV website with the headline: \u201cThree Children Allegedly Die of Anti-polio Injection in Peshawar.\u201d\n\nA fact finding inquiry by Pakistan\u2019s Health Department at the time found that the three children had not died due to polio vaccinations, according to an official report published on May 3, 2018.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the health department report, provided to AFP by the provincial health department in Peshawar:\n\nDr Imtiaz Shah, Focal Person for the World Health Organisation in Peshawar, speaking about the 2018 incident, told AFP by phone: \"One child died due to measles and second died due to septicemia, while the third died because he got under her mother when they were sleeping. None of these child because of a reaction to anti-polio vaccine.\"\n\nMultiple media reports at the time, for example this report which published by Pakistani daily newspaper The News on May 8, 2018, and this report published by Pakistani daily newspaper Business Recorder, said that the three children did not die from the polio vaccine.\n\nProvincial health minister Hisham Inamullah said no child in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the province in which Peshawar is situated, had ever died due to receiving the polio vaccine. He made the statement in this video posted on his political party\u2019s official Facebook page on April 22, 2019.\n\nHis statement in Urdu translates to English in part as: \u201cAll the children of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (province) and Pakistan are our own children. If there had been such an incident that any child, God forbid, had become unstable or any such incident had happened, some death has occurred, then I would have been disturbed myself first of all. There is no such thing.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Inamullah also told AFP in a face-to-face interview on April 22, 2019: \u201cNo child has died nor has been affected after taking polio vaccine.\u201d\n\nAFP published another fact check on false polio deaths in Peshawar on May 15, 2019 here .", "lang": "en"}
