Spanish was spoken a total of 14 times, it claims.\n\nThere were 63 mentions of President Donald Trump\u2019s last name, 17 instances of the word \u201cfree\u201d and nearly 80 of the word \u201cAmerica.\u201d Spanish was spoken around eight times.\n\nTwenty candidates participated in the first Democratic presidential debate of the 2020 election cycle, hosted in Miami. To accommodate the crowded presidential field, the debate was split into two nights, with 10 candidates appearing on stage each night.\n\nThe first night\u2019s lineup included Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar, as well as former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and several lesser-known candidates. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, both frontrunners in the race, participated in night two of the debate.\n\nMillions of viewers watched the broadcasts, with many chiming in over social media. As commentary continued into the weekend, one image posted on Facebook claimed that Trump\u2019s name was invoked an inordinate 1,326 times during the debate.\n\nNight one candidates largely avoided talking about Trump, as many outlets noted, but the second night\u2019s debaters took a number of swipes at the president. In fact, Vox joked that \u201cthere were 10 new candidates onstage during night two of the first Democratic presidential debate \u2013 11, if you count President Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nHowever, the image greatly exaggerates the number of times his last name was uttered. According to transcripts from The New York Times, Trump was mentioned by name 63 times in the two nights of debate, including instances where the moderators said his name.\n\nNBC News tallied 87 instances where Democrats referred to the president by name or title, with 35 mentions on the first night and 52 on the second night. CNN recorded a slightly different count.

Booker mentioned the free market economy once, for example.\n\nAs candidates fielded questions on topics ranging from climate change to immigration, they tried to convey their vision for the country. Unsurprisingly, the word \u201cAmerica\u201d got tossed around quite a bit. The image claims it was used twice, but it actually appears in NYT transcripts nearly 80 times.\n\nThe Daily Caller excluded the word \u201cAmericans\u201d from this count, as well as a few instances where candidates referred to Central America.\n\nThe meme was closer in its claim that Spanish was spoken 14 times during the debate. In lieu of transcribing these remarks, many news outlets used placeholder terms like \u201cUNTRANSLATED\u201d or \u201cSPEAKING IN SPANISH\u201d in their transcripts. Counting these instances alone, the Caller found eight instances of Spanish being spoken in transcripts from the Times.\n\nCandidates like O\u2019Rourke, Booker and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro spoke Spanish, with varying degrees of proficiency, though our tally also includes the Spanish spoken by Telemundo host Jose Diaz-Balart.", "lang": "en"}
