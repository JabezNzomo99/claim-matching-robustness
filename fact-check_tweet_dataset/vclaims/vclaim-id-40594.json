Wildlife poaching is not punishable by the death penalty under Kenyan law. The claim comes from erroneous reporting in a Xinhua news agency article.\n\nKenya and other African countries have seen their wildlife populations, particularly those of elephants and rhinos, decimated by illegal wildlife poaching, according to The Guardian. The African Wildlife Foundation predicts that elephants, rhinos and several other species may go extinct \u201cwithin our lifetime\u201d at current poaching rates.\n\nThe Wildlife Conservation and Management Act of 2013 outlines punishments for various poaching convictions in Kenya. Penalties range from a fine of one million shillings and/or five years\u2019 imprisonment up to a fine of 20 million shillings and life imprisonment, depending on the severity of the crime.\n\nThe Facebook post alleges that Kenya has introduced legislation that significantly increases the severity of punishment for poaching wildlife, with the caption reading, \u201cKenya has introduced a law that would institute death penalty for all wildlife poachers regradless (sic) of their nationality.\u201d It has been shared more than 400 times.\n\nA quick internet search turned up a number of articles repeating the death penalty claim. Some publications reported that Kenyan Tourism and Wildlife Minister Najib Balala publicly announced the move, even quoting him as saying that existing penalties have \u201cnot been deterrence enough to curb poaching.\u201d\n\nBalala\u2019s alleged remarks in these articles originated in a 2018 article published by Chinese news agency Xinhua, according to AFP. That article placed his statement at an event organized by the Postal Corporation of Kenya. Patrick Omondi, the former director of research monitoring and strategic initiative at the tourism ministry, told AFP that Balala did not attend the event.\n\n\u201cThat is misinformation,\u201d Omondi told AFP. \u201cI was the one reading the minister\u2019s statement at the meeting and I can tell you nothing I spoke on behalf of the minister was related to the death penalty for poachers.\u201d\n\nOmondi also told AFP that there are no plans to institute capital punishment for poaching either.

President Uhuru Kenyatta commuted all death sentences in Kenya to life imprisonment in 2016, according to The New York Times. His predecessor, former Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki, did the same in 2009.\n\nIn 2017, the Supreme Court of Kenya ruled unconstitutional the mandatory sentencing of capital punishment for crimes such as murder, treason and armed robbery, according to the World Coalition Against the Death Penalty.", "lang": "en"}
