Ambassador Susan Rice earned an instant Two Pinocchios for her statements on the Sunday news shows, arguing that \u201cextremist elements\u201d had joined in what she called a demonstration that began \u201cspontaneously\u201d in response to another demonstration in Cairo \u201csparked by this hateful video.\u201d As we put it: \u201cThe administration obviously wants to play down the possibility of a planned attack because that would raise broader questions about whether U.S. intelligence and embassy security in Libya were adequate. But Rice\u2019s comments strain credulity, especially after Libya\u2019s president declared without a doubt that the attack was planned.\u201d Administration officials sharply disputed these conclusions, especially the awarding of any Pinocchios. But the gap between Rice\u2019s statements and other information publicly available at the time made a Pinocchio rating appropriate. Over time, Rice\u2019s remarks that Sunday, five days after the attack, would come back to haunt the administration.\n\nFrom video to terrorist attack: A definitive timeline of administration statements on the Libya attack\n\nOct. 17, 2012: The Benghazi tragedy led to one of the most memorable moments of the Obama-Romney debates. Here, we untangled their dispute over whether Obama had quickly called it a \u201cterrorist attack.\u201d Obama was correct that, in the day or two after the attacks, he did use phrasing such as \u201cact of terror,\u201d though it was vaguer than he implied in the debate. Moreover, he then dropped the phrase and for at least a week the administration pushed a narrative that characterized the attacks as a spontaneous reaction to the video, rather than terrorism. Romney, meanwhile, was correct that it took at least two weeks for Obama to forthrightly call it a terrorist attack.\n\nMcCain\u2019s claims about Susan Rice\u2019s comments on the Libya attack\n\nHillary Clinton and the Aug. 16 cable on Benghazi security\n\nIssa\u2019s absurd claim that Clinton\u2019s \u2018signature\u2019 means she personally approved it\n\nThe Benghazi hearings: What\u2019s new and what\u2019s not\n\nAn alternative explanation for the Benghazi talking points: Bureaucratic knife fight\n\nMay 10, 2013: This analysis first suggested that the core reason for the evolution of the talking points was a bureaucratic battle between the CIA and the State Department. We informed readers that although the ambassador was killed, the Benghazi \u201cconsulate\u201d was not a consulate at all but essentially a secret CIA operation which included an effort to round up shoulder-launched missiles. U.S. officials had been constrained in discussing that fact, as the administration could not publicly admit that most of the Americans in Benghazi were involved in a secret CIA effort that had not even been formally disclosed to the Libyan government. State Department officials objected to the talking points, initially drafted by the CIA, as an effort by the spy agency to pin the blame for the tragedy on the State Department. (Here\u2019s a good explainer on the e-mails in question.)\n\nObama\u2019s claim he called Benghazi an \u2018act of terrorism\u2019\n\nMay 14, 2013: The president tried to rewrite history by claiming \u201cthe day after it happened, I acknowledged that this was an act of terrorism.\u201d But he had actually said \u201cact of terror\u201d\u2014 in vague terms, usually wrapped in a patriotic fervor: \u201cNo acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for.\u201d In fact, immediately after the Rose Garden statement the day after the attacks, Obama sat down with Steve Kroft of \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and acknowledged that he had purposely avoided the using the word \u201cterrorism.\u201d (CBS did not release this clip until after the election.) There were other occasions when the president ducked questions about whether this was an act of terrorism. The president earned Four Pinocchios for his effort at revising history.\n\nThe White House claim of \u2018doctored e-mails \u2026 to smear the president\u2019\n\nHas anyone been \u2018fired\u2019 because of the Benghazi attacks?\n\nIssa\u2019s \u2018suspicions\u2019 that Hillary Clinton told Panetta to \u2018stand down\u2019 on Benghazi\n\nRand Paul\u2019s claim there was \u2018no plane\u2019 for Special Ops forces in Benghazi\n\nBill Clinton\u2019s strained comparison of diplomatic deaths in different administrations\n\nThe false claim that Clinton relied on Sid Blumenthal \u2018for most of her intelligence\u2019 on Libya\n\nWhat Benghazi family members say Hillary Clinton said about the video\n\n600 \u2018requests\u2019 from Benghazi for better security: What this statistic really means\n\nJan. 26, 2016: We explored a figure that has been widely cited since the House Select Committee on Benghazi held a hearing in October featuring Clinton \u2014 that there were \u201c600 requests\u201d for security upgrades from U.S. officials based in Benghazi, Libya. It turned out that few in the media or the political world have understood what this figure is supposed to mean, and in fact have almost always described it incorrectly. The committee was counting \u201crequests and concerns.\u201d At least some of the requests were actually fulfilled \u2014 and the counting of \u201cconcerns\u201d may be subject to dispute. A filure to note that distinction is worthy of Two Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
