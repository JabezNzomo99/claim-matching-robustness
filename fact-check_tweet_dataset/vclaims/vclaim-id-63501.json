This particular post remarks, \u201cDo as I say not as I do!\u201d\n\nFacebook users have shared the photo with inaccurate context, however.

Rick Snyder and former Lansing Mayor Virg Bernero, according to the Lansing State Journal.\n\nA spokesperson for the brewery confirmed to the Daily Caller via phone that Whitmer visited for a tasting in February 2019. The spokesperson also said that Lansing Brewing Company is not currently serving patrons at the tables inside the brewery.\n\nMichigan\u2019s \u201cStay Home, Stay Safe\u201d order remains in effect, but some restrictions have been relaxed, such as allowing social gatherings of up to 10 people and allowing restaurants and shops to open in some areas.", "lang": "en"}
