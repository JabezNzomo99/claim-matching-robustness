On November 1st, you\u2019re going to have new numbers come out for Obamacare, having to do with increases. President Obama is trying to get it moved to December. Because it is election-defying. It is going to be a massive number, the biggest number ever in our country\u2019s history for health care.\u201d\n\n \u2014 Trump, news conference, July 27, 2016\n\nThis is one of Trump\u2019s go-to lines about premium increases under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. He warns of premium increases of 40, 50, 60 percent \u2014 and alleges that the Obama administration is trying to delay open enrollment, scheduled for Nov. 1, until after the election because the drastic rate hikes will be \u201celection-defying.\u201d Are his claims accurate?\n\nA health-care policy adviser for the Trump campaign pointed out examples of proposed and approved rate increases as high as 70 percent for 2017. Among the highest increases is in Texas, where Blue Cross Blue Shield plans to increase its premiums an average of 57.3 percent to 59.4 percent across individual market plans. The campaign also cited a plan in Iowa with a 43 percent increase, three plans in Pennsylvania with requested increases of 40 percent and a 19 percent increase in Florida.\n\nIndeed, premiums are expected to increase overall in 2017 \u2014 but Trump is cherry-picking from the highest proposed increases in the insurance marketplace. He has made a version of this claim since June 2015, and our friends at FactCheck.org have been debunking it repeatedly since.\n\nState-by-state weighted average increases range from just 1.3 percent in Rhode Island to as high as 71 percent in Oklahoma, according to calculations by Charles Gaba, who keeps careful track of enrollment figures at ACASignups.net. As of Sept. 22, the average increase across individual markets in 21 approved states is 25.5 percent.\n\nBut premiums for the two lowest-cost silver plans \u2014 the most common choices in the marketplaces \u2014 will increase by a weighted average of 9 percent, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s July analysis. These plans have been used as the benchmark to calculate government subsidies.\n\nAbout eight in 10 marketplace enrollees receive government premium subsidies, and they are protected from a premium increase (and may even see a decrease) if they stay with a low-cost plan. The report says \u201canecdotal examples of premium hikes or averages across insurers can provide a skewed picture of the increases marketplace enrollees will actually face.\u201d\n\nBut state insurance departments are approving those rates now, and rates will be public by the time open enrollment begins Nov. 1. This date is set, per federal regulations published in March. The Obama administration has not indicated that it would move the date. And if the administration wanted to change the date, some type of public notice and comment period would have begun months ago.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services confirmed in a statement that open enrollment will begin Nov. 1: \u201cDates for the upcoming Open Enrollment are the same as this past year and have already been finalized through rule-making in CMS\u2019 [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] annual payment notice published this spring. They won\u2019t be moved.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that most workers (about 155 million people) in the United States get their health care through their employer, so the exchanges, with about 11 million enrollees, are just a small part of the health-care market. (We wrote in-depth about this here.)\n\nThis is a classic Trump claim. He cherry-picks the most extreme examples, applies them to the general population, then ascribes nefarious motives that can\u2019t actually come to fruition. He says rates will increase by 40, 50, 60 percent \u2014 but the most common plans in the marketplace will see an average increase of 9 percent. The vast majority of marketplace enrollees receive government premium subsidies and will be protected from premium increases.\n\nTrump also says the Obama administration wants to, and is trying to, move the Nov. 1 open-enrollment date because everyone will see the \u201celection-defying\u201d premium hikes on that date. Yet this open-enrollment date is set in federal statutes, and if the administration wanted to move it, it would have needed to tell the public months ago through a public notice and comment process.\n\nWord of advice for Trump: If you\u2019re running for the presidency, it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to learn how federal regulations work. And since you claim you want to repeal Obamacare, you might want to learn how it works, too.", "lang": "en"}
