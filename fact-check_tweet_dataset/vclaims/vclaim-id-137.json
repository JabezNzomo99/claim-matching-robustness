Public Health England and South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust are referenced in the message. Both organisations have publicly refuted the information in the clip.\n\nIn the voice note the woman refers to working at SECAmb, a widely used abbreviation for South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust (here). She describes the information as having been given to UK ambulance services by Public Health England. She makes claims about estimated numbers of deaths per day in the UK and states that ambulance services are due to be severely curtailed.\n\nPublic Health England (PHE) released a statement through social media on March 8 (here) describing the voice message as \u201cfake news\u201d. PHE requested that people ignore the message and refrain from sharing it further. South East Coast Ambulance Service also referenced the voice message in a March 8 social media post (here ). They described the information in the message as alarmist and advised that it is disregarded.\n\nMultiple comments on social media suggest the voice note was widely shared on WhatsApp as a voice note. It is not clear who recorded the message.\n\nFalse: the information in the audio file has been strongly refuted by Public Health England and the local ambulance trust mentioned in the message.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
