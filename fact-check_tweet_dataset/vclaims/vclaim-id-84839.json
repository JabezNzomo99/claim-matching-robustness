So we decided it\u2019s our turn to get to the bottom of leading theories underlying this claim. Of course, the Trump campaign as usual did not respond to our request for information.\n\nAll of these articles about his boyhood in Indonesia and his life in Hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse, multicultural and putting that in a new light. It also exposes a very strong weakness for him \u2014 his roots to basic American values and culture are at best limited. I cannot imagine America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally American in his thinking and in his values. He told the people of NH yesterday he has a Kansas accent because his mother was from there. His mother lived in many states as far as we can tell \u2014 but this is an example of the nonsense he uses to cover this up.\n\n\u201cWhat it goes back to is \u2026 not the Clinton campaign or her staff, but her supporters, as she was losing in the, sort of, really bitter spring of 2008,\u201d Ben Smith, co-author of a Politico article digging into the birther movement\u2019s roots, said in a 2011 MSNBC interview. \u201cSome of her passionate supporters were kind of grasping at straws for reasons he [Obama] could be ineligible for president.\u201d\n\nChain emails surfaced claiming Obama was ineligible to become president because he was born in Kenya, as his mom was too young to travel by plane back to America to give birth. Others claimed Obama was refusing to release his full birth certificate because it probably contains information that he had dual Kenyan and U.S. citizenship at birth.\n\nKroft: \u201cYou don\u2019t believe that Senator Obama is a Muslim?\u201d Clinton: \u201cOf course not. I mean, that\u2019s\u2026 You know, there is no basis for that. I take him on the basis of what he says. And, you know, there isn\u2019t any reason to doubt that.\u201d Kroft: \u201cYou said you\u2019d take Senator Obama at his word that he\u2019s not a Muslim.\u201d Clinton: \u201cNo. Why would I? There is nothing to base that on, as far as I know.\u201d Clinton: \u201cLook, I have been the target of so many ridiculous rumors that I have a great deal of sympathy for anybody who gets, you know, smeared with the kind of rumors that go on all the time.\u201d\n\n[Update: James Asher, former D.C. bureau chief of McClatchy, tweeted on Sept. 16 that Clinton ally Sidney Blumenthal had met with him to ask for an investigation into birther rumors in 2008. Asher told McClatchy that Blumenthal \u201cstrongly urged\u201d him to \u201cinvestigate the exact place of President Obama\u2019s birth, which he suggested was in Kenya.\u201d McClatchy assigned a reporter to go to Kenya, and the reporter found the allegation was false, Asher said.\n\nWe reached out to Asher, but he did not respond to our requests for further explanation. Blumenthal, declining to elaborate further, said in a statement to The Fact Checker: \u201cThis is false. Period. Donald Trump cannot distract from the fact that he is the one who embraced and promoted the birther lie, and bears the responsibility for it.\u201d]\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence to support Trump\u2019s repeated claim that Clinton \u201cstarted\u201d the birther movement and was one of the first to question Obama\u2019s birth certificate. He could blame the actions of Clinton\u2019s supporters during the 2008 primary or say the rumor has some Democratic roots. But there\u2019s no evidence that she or her campaign questioned his birth certificate or his citizenship. Further, the campaign denounced isolated instances of Clinton\u2019s staffers questioning whether Obama was Muslim.", "lang": "en"}
