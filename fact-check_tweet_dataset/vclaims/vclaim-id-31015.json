I got it. Why don\u2019t we nuke them?\u201d according to one source who was there. \u201cThey start forming off the coast of Africa, as they\u2019re moving across the Atlantic, we drop a bomb inside the eye of the hurricane and it disrupts it. Why can\u2019t we do that?\u201d the source added, paraphrasing the president\u2019s remarks \u2026 Trump also raised the idea in another conversation with a senior administration official. A 2017 NSC memo describes that second conversation, in which Trump asked whether the administration should bomb hurricanes to stop them from hitting the homeland. A source briefed on the NSC memo said it does not contain the word \u201cnuclear\u201d; it just says the president talked about bombing hurricanes.\n\nReacting to the report, Trump declared it to be \u201cfake news,\u201d suggesting the claim that he \u201cwanted to blow up large hurricanes with nuclear weapons prior to reaching shore\u201d was \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\nIn response, Axios reporter Jonathan Swan, who reported the story with Margaret Talev, tweeted that he stood by what he wrote, reiterating Axios\u2019 sourcing:\n\nSnopes cannot independently verify the claims of anonymous sources cited in the Axios story, or claims contained within documents we have not seen. As such, we rank the claim \u201cUnproven.\u201d This rating could change if corroborating information becomes public.", "lang": "en"}
