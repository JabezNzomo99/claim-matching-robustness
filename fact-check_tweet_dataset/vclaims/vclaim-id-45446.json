[Translated from \u0938\u094b\u0936\u0932 \u092e\u0940\u0921\u093f\u092f\u093e \u092a\u0930 ZEE NEWS \u0915\u0947 \u0928\u093e\u092e \u0938\u0947 \u090f\u0915 \u091d\u0942\u0920\u0940 \u0916\u092c\u0930 \u092b\u0948\u0932\u093e\u0908 \u091c\u093e \u0930\u0939\u0940 \u0939\u0948.]\n\nIn addition to this, Alt News compared the breaking news graphic on Zee Media from a June 11 bulletin available on YouTube (right) with the viral image (left). Evidently, the font style and size and the shade of the red background are different.\n\nThus a morphed Zee News graphic is viral on social media claiming that the Home Ministry had indicated that the country will be under complete lockdown from June 15. Had the government made any such announcement, it would have been covered by the media or an official declaration would have been made. The government-affiliated fact-check wing of PIB also tweeted that the news is false.\n\n[Update: The genuine Zee News screengrab in the comparison collage has been altered with the format that was used in the viral graphic.]", "lang": "en"}
