No, that's not true: a summary of an article on the website of a tiny Canadian political party opened with a headline making that claim and it went quite viral but the actual text of the pact says the exact opposite.\n\nThe claim was made in a summary published on December 12, 2018 on the website of the (tiny) Cultural Action Party of Canada titled \"Justin Trudeau Transfers Canadian Border Control To United Nations\" (archived here) which read:\n\nHere is the article it links to:\n\nNow let's compare that to what the pact actually says (you can read it in full here).\n\nFirst of all, the document is not legally binding and it explicitly says it upholds the sovereignty of states:\n\nIt explicitly mentions this also goes for border management policies:\n\nIt also says migration policiy and determining migration status is something that is the right of sovereign states:\n\nNational sovereignty: The Global Compact reaffirms the sovereign right of States to determine\n\ntheir national migration policy and their prerogative to govern migration within their jurisdiction,\n\nin conformity with international law. Within their sovereign jurisdiction, States may distinguish\n\nbetween regular and irregular migration status, including as they determine their legislative and\n\npolicy measures for the implementation of the Global Compact, taking into account different\n\nnational realities, policies, priorities and requirements for entry, residence and work, in\n\naccordance with international law.\n\nThe references to international law are about things like freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, the right to life etc. that are part of general human rights agreed between countries. It just means you can't randomly shoot, forcibly convert, imprison or torture people at the border (or anywhere else, for that matter). But states are still free to decide who they let in (or not). Including Canada.\n\nSo the claim that the United Nations are now running Canadian border control is objectively not true. Canada is still able to decide who gets in or not (even though some people may not agree on the policy decided on by the Canadian government, but that is a different discussion).", "lang": "en"}
