The project would create part-year work in four states for 10,400 workers, the State Department determined. That added up to a total of 3,900 annual construction jobs. About 12,000 other annual jobs would stem from direct spending on the project. So that adds up to 16,000, most of which are not construction jobs. (This statement earned Three Pinocchios.)\n\nThe trade-deficit number is close to correct, but Trump apparently does not understand the meaning of \u201ctrade deficit.\u201d He often suggests this money could be used to pay for his planned wall along the southern border. But that\u2019s nonsensical. A trade deficit only means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country. No money passes from government to government.", "lang": "en"}
