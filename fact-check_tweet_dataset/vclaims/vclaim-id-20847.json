In 1991, Thatcher allegedly told an audience in Houston, Texas that it would be \u201ceconomically feasible for only 15 million people to live in Russia.\u201d\n\nSome Russian journalists initially disputed that Margaret Thatcher gave any speeches in Houston during 1991. In fact, she delivered a speech in Houston that year to representatives of the oil industry, and the New York Times published an article about it. However, the speech was about environmental concerns and regulations and did not mention Russia.\n\nThe \u201cquote\u201d cited by the Russian Foreign Ministry actually comes from a Russian-language book by Andrey Parshev called \"Why Russia is Not America.\"\n\nParshev claimed to have heard an audio recording of the speech, but has never provided any evidence for his claim. He has also several times changed the quote he allegedly \u201cheard.\u201d Most recently, he claimed Thatcher said that only 15 million people in the Soviet Union were employed in the most efficient sector of its economy.\n\nOutside of Parshev\u2019s book, there is no record of this alleged Thatcher quote or any of Parshev\u2019s subsequent versions of it.", "lang": "en"}
