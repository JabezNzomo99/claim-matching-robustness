Due to the lack of all public transport, they couldn't go home either. At a time when social distancing was a mandate, hordes of migrants and daily wagers started a long walk to their home states. Prominent leaders shared the photo claiming it is of migrants workers ignored by the governments. The Official Twitter Account of Indian National Congress' Scheduled Caste Department tweeted the photo.\n\nPhoto of man carrying his mother on his back is of a migrant worker walking back home A reverse image search led to a report by Pressenza an International News Agency, published back in 2017.\n\nTherefore, the photo definitely predates the lockdown. According to the report, the photographer of the viral image is Mobarak Hossain. The photos inserted in the report depict the Rohingya refugees who have made their way to Bangladesh. Stateless, discriminated against, living in poor conditions with limited access to the basic necessities of life, the Rohingya are considered the \"most persecuted minority group in the world\" by the international community. After violence erupted in their villages in the Rakhini State of Myanmar, thousands upon thousands of Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh and nearby countries seeking refuge, shelter and, yes, hope of deliverance from the violence and discrimination. Further, a report on a Bangladesh news website, Ukhiya news, reported on a man Osiur who carried his mother on his back for 4 days.\n\nA video is also included inside the article, Osiur explains how he walked for almost four days through forests, escaped Myanmar, reached Bangladesh, all the while carrying his mother on his back.\n\nTherefore, the video shows a Rohingya refugee and not a migrant worker.
