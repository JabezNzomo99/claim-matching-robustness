That\u2019s a longstanding, unsupported claim that his children have denied.\n\nOn the week of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and days after what would have been his 90th birthday, social media posts have revived an evidence-free claim about the civil rights icon.\n\n\u201cMLK was Republican,\u201d one such post reads, \u201cand would\u2019ve MAGA\u2019d today.\u201d\n\nAlong with a doctored photo of King wearing a hat that reads, \u201cMake American Great Again\u201d \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign slogan \u2014 the post repeats the unsupported claim that King was a member of the GOP. Among those to previously debunk it, PolitiFact thoroughly dissected the claim in 2011.\n\nIn reality, transcripts show King often openly rejected the party binary.\n\nIn a 1956 speech, for example, he said: \u201cActually, the Negro has been betrayed by both the Republican and the Democratic Party.\u201d The same year, in a letter citing his uncertainty about for whom he would vote for president, he wrote that, \u201cIn the past I have always voted the Democratic ticket.\u201d\n\nAnd in 1958, he noted: \u201cI don\u2019t think the Republican party is a party full of the almighty God nor is the Democratic party. They both have weaknesses. And I\u2019m not inextricably bound to either party.\u201d\n\nThe unsupported assertion that King was a Republican has cropped up numerous times, sometimes citing King\u2019s niece, Alveda King, who once declared her uncle was a Republican.\n\nBut Alveda King in a 2013 Newsmax column said that her earlier statement was made \u201cwithout having all the facts\u201d and that \u201cUncle M. L. tended to vote Democrat, but remained independent because he found weaknesses in both parties.\u201d\n\nLikewise, two of King\u2019s children, Martin Luther King III and Bernice King, have both denied that their father was a Republican.\n\nIn a statement provided to the Associated Press in 2008, King III said: \u201cIt is disingenuous to imply that my father was a Republican. He never endorsed any presidential candidate, and there is certainly no evidence that he ever even voted for a Republican. It is even more outrageous to suggest that he would support the Republican Party of today, which has spent so much time and effort trying to suppress African American votes in Florida and many other states.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201c\u2018Desegregation and the Future,\u2019 Address Delivered at the Annual Luncheon of the National Committee for Rural Schools.\u201d The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute, Stanford University.
