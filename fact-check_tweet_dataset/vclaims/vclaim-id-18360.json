In other cases, the posts home in on their birth names and nicknames, as if evidence of deception \u2014 even though most are widely known.\n\nWe\u2019ll go through each claim here.\n\u2022 Former President Barack \u201cObama\u2019s Real Name is Barry Soetoro.\u201d\n\n False. This claim appeared in an April Fools\u2019 hoax that we debunked in 2009, which claimed that Obama enrolled at Occidental College as an international student under the name Barry Soetoro. He didn\u2019t. \u201cBarry\u201d was a family nickname for Obama, and Soetoro was the surname of his Indonesian stepfather.\n\u2022 Minnesota Rep. \u201cIlhan Omar\u2019s Real Name is Ilhan Esmi.\u201d\n\n False. This may be part misconception and part misspelling: Omar was previously married to a man named Ahmed Nur Said Elmi. They are now divorced and she is married to Ahmed Hirsi.\n\u2022 New York Sen. \u201cKirsten Gillibrand\u2019s real name is Tina Rutnick.\u201d\n\n Gillibrand was born K irsten Elizabeth Rutnik, though her nickname was Tina growing up, as she recalled in her 2014 book, \u201cOff the Sidelines: Raise Your Voice, Change the World.\u201d She married Jonathan Gillibrand in 2001.\n\u2022 New York City Mayor \u201cBill DeBlasio\u2019s real name is Warren Wilhelm Jr.\u201d\n\n It\u2019s true that de Blasio was born Warren Wilhelm Jr. \u2014 but he\u2019s changed his name. A spokesman in 2013 told the New York Daily News that the mayor adopted his mother\u2019s surname, de Blasio, \u201cbecause his father was largely absent from his life, a fact he has been open about throughout his time in public service.\u201d He reportedly changed his name in 1983 to Warren de Blasio-Wilhelm before legally changing it again in 2001 to Bill de Blasio.\n\u2022 Former Texas Rep. \u201cBeto Orourke is Robert Orourke.\u201d\n\n O\u2019Rourke\u2019s name is indeed Robert O\u2019Rourke; Beto is a nickname sometimes used for people named \u201cRoberto,\u201d or Robert in Spanish. O\u2019Rourke hasn\u2019t tried to hide that fact: His campaign filings with the Federal Election Commission, for example, use \u201cRobert Beto O\u2019Rourke.\u201d\n\u2022 Vermont Sen. \u201cBernie Sanders is Bernard Gutman.\u201d\n\n False. His name is Bernard Sanders. A 1921 U.S. immigration arrival record from Ellis Island shows that Sanders\u2019 father, Eli (a Poland native who arrived as Eliasz Gitman and was naturalized under the name Elias Sanders), listed his mother (Bernie Sanders\u2019 grandmother) as Jetti Gutman.\n\u2022 California Sen. \u201cKamala Harris is Maya Harrison.\u201d\n\n False. Her full name is Kamala Devi Harris. She has a younger sister named Maya Harris.\n\u2022 South Bend, Indiana, Mayor \u201cPete Buttigeig is Paul Montgomery.\u201d\n\n Buttigieg\u2019s full name is Peter Paul Montgomery Buttigieg.\n\u2022 Massachusetts Sen. \u201cElizabeth Warren is Liz Herring.\u201d\n\n \u201cLiz\u201d is sometimes short for Elizabeth, and her maiden name is Herring. Warren kept the surname of her first husband, Jim Warren, after they divorced in 1980.\n\u2022 New Jersey Sen. \u201cCory Booker was known as Tony Booker.\u201d\n\n Booker\u2019s full name is Cory Anthony Booker.\n\u2022 Former Attorney General \u201cEric Holder is Eric Himpton.\u201d\n\n False. Holder\u2019s full name is Eric Himpton Holder Jr.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
