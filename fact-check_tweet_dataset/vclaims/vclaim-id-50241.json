For instance, chickenpox is an infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus, just like the COVID-19 disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, Fauci was not the source of, or at all connected to, the viral message. Rather, we determined Facebook user Amy Wright, of Asheville, North Carolina, was the post\u2019s original author.\n\nShe confirmed with us via Facebook messenger that she published the original post (which can be read here) on June 14, 2020, and made minor amendments to the message\u2019s grammar and wording since then. Then, over the course of several weeks, she said, private Facebook groups in her hometown began to circulate the post.\n\nAnd after that, the statement spread like wildfire online, and people began falsely asserting that Fauci had said it. It was unclear who, or what account, was the first to make that inaccurate connection. Also unclear was their motivation for doing so. No evidence proves that Fauci made any written or verbal statement resembling the post in question. Wright told us:\n\nElaborating on the process of authoring a viral post which is later mischaracterized, Wright said in Facebook comments:\n\nAs for the veracity of Wright\u2019s message: yes, the varicella-zoster virus remains in patients\u2019 bodies, even after they suffer chickenpox symptoms (namely an itchy skin rash with bumps, blisters and scabs). And, according to Mayo Clinic, the virus can reactivate and resurface years after the initial infection as painful clusters of blisters, called shingles. Older adults and immune-compromised people who have had chickenpox are more likely to suffer from shingles than other populations.\n\nAdditionally, the post accurately explains that years-old studies by scientists and medical professionals have determined that the viruses that cause herpes infections remain dormant in patients\u2019 bodies \u2014 which means they don\u2019t have any outbreaks \u2014 for weeks, months, or years on end. And, similarly, to make the point that the passage of time provides the research community the ability to make conclusive determinations on emerging illnesses and infections, Wright\u2019s post emphasized the years it took for Americans to understand HIV and how certain treatments can help patients manage and reduce the risk of spreading it.\n\nThen, while listing almost two dozen symptoms of COVID-19 \u2014 roughly half of which are verifiable via the Mayo Clinic and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), while other reported symptoms in the post are listed on WebMD \u2014 the post said this of COVID-19:\n\nThis disease has not been around for years. It has basically been 6 months. No one knows yet the long-term health effects, or how it may present itself years down the road for people who have been exposed. We literally *do not know* what we do not know. For those in our society who suggest that people being cautious are cowards, for people who refuse to take even the simplest of precautions to protect themselves and those around them, I want to ask, without hyperbole and in all sincerity:\n\nThe remaining portion of the message criticizes the actions and philosophies of people who think they would be better off by catching coronavirus sooner rather than later, essentially suggesting that COVID-19 patients were immune from falling ill due to the virus again even though scientific evidence was inconclusive on the topic as of this writing.\n\nThe CDC stated on its website that, \u201cWe do not know yet if people who recover from COVID-19 can get infected again. Scientists are working to understand this.\u201d\n\nWright ends her post with the following:\n\nIn sum, given the fact that no one appeared to have shared or written the viral message before Wright\u2019s status update on June 14, and the fact that she said she had written the post \u2014 not Fauci \u2014 we rate this claim \u201cMisattributed.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
