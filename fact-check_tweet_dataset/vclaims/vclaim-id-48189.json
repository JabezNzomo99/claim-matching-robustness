It reads, in part:\n\nThe communist regime has millions of its own citizens slaving in gulags simply for speaking against the government or openly practicing Christianity. Knowing they could not attack us openly they needed to be coy, like a deceptive fox. In my opinion, I believe the regime released a biological weapon upon the world that doesn\u2019t kill everyone, but kills \u201cenough,\u201d especially the elderly and in-firmed. Back in WW 2 Hitler thought the same way. He got rid of what he considered the useless and rejects of society.\n\nHowever, we found no evidence that O\u2019Reilly, who currently publishes commentary on his own website, wrote the essay in question. Readers reported spotting the essay on Facebook and also in forwarded emails. But it was not posted by O\u2019Reilly on his website or his social media accounts. We also found no evidence via other news sources that O\u2019Reilly promoted the debunked conspiracy theory that the COVID-19 pandemic was an act of biological warfare by the Chinese government.\n\nIn point of fact, the essay\u2019s true author appears to be a Facebook user named Tim Besmer Sr., who posted it to his page on April 2 with a copyright notice in his own name and the words \u201cPermission given for public sharing\u201d appended. At that time, the post was labeled \u201cFalse\u201d by Facebook\u2019s independent fact-checking partners.\n\nWe have not been able to ascertain who added O\u2019Reilly\u2019s byline to the essay, but within days of its initial posting a version appeared containing both Besmer\u2019s name and O\u2019Reilly\u2019s, followed by variants attributed to O\u2019Reilly alone.\n\nIn a statement to Snopes, a representative for O\u2019Reilly\u2019s website confirmed that \u201cBill O\u2019Reilly did not write a single word of the essay in question,\u201d adding that the pundit \u201cdoes not traffic in conspiracy theories.\u201d\n\nWe therefore rate this quoted item \u201cMisattributed.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
