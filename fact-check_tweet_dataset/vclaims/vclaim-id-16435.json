He hasn\u2019t been cleared in the investigation of Russian meddling and collusion, either.\n\nBut, a story from RedStateWave.com has been circulating on Facebook with the headline: \u201cBREAKING: ROSENSTEIN JUST CLEARED PRESIDENT TRUMP!\u201d\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller in May 2017 to lead the investigation into Russia\u2019s campaign interference and whether Trump campaign officials were involved in those efforts.\n\nSo far, the special counsel\u2019s office has not presented any evidence of collusion, but four people who worked on Donald Trump\u2019s campaign have been indicted. All but one has pleaded guilty.\n\nA Facebook page called \u201cDonald Trump For President,\u201d which has more than four million followers, presented the misleading headline under the words: \u201cFinally!\u201d and \u201cTook him long enough.\u201d (The Facebook page is run by the same individual who owns RedStateWave.com and RedStateWatcher.com.)\n\nBut the story doesn\u2019t support the sensational headline. It\u2019s actually about the much more recent investigation of Michael Cohen, one of Trump\u2019s personal lawyers whose home, office and hotel room were raided by the FBI on April 9. Most of the story is taken from a Fox News report that said Rosenstein told Trump he wasn\u2019t a target of the Cohen investigation.\n\nSeveral other major news organizations reported on the same meeting, including CBS News, Bloomberg, and Reuters \u2013 all relying on unnamed sources who said Rosenstein told Trump he was not a target of either the Cohen or Russia investigations.\n\nBut telling Trump he is not a \u201ctarget\u201d of the investigation is not the same as being \u201ccleared.\u201d\n\nA \u201ctarget\u201d is someone who prosecutors see as a likely defendant in a case that would come out of an investigation, according to the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Manual. Investigations can also include \u201csubjects,\u201d who fall within the scope of the probe and can also be charged. A person\u2019s status can change at any point during an ongoing investigation.\n\nAlthough the misleading headline prompted hundreds of outraged responses on Facebook, some users of the social media site flagged it as potentially false. We can\u2019t confirm what Rosenstein may have told the president in a private meeting, but even if Rosenstein told him he is not a target of the investigations, that doesn\u2019t support the headline that Trump has been \u201ccleared.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nDepartment of Justice.
