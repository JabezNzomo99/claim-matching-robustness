In the video a man makes a series of claims about the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and what he says is information from a whistleblower in GSK.\n\nThe central claim is that a COVID-19 vaccine already exists and contains chemicals that cause infertility.\n\nThe post has been shared more than 390 times since it was posted on June 17, 2020. The same meme or claims based on the video have appeared on other pages and platforms including here, here and here.\n\nThe Facebook post claims an unidentified \u201cUK GlaxoSmithKline whistleblower\u201d revealed \u201cthe upcoming covid vaccine\u201d will contain antigens that cause infertility. The video, created by an individual introduced as Zed Phoenix (and later named as Ben Fellows) makes a series of claims, including that a GSK insider delivered information that a COVID-19 vaccine had already been made.\n\nIn the video the speaker says he wants to \u201clook at who is running the vaccine trial\u201d and names Dr Andrew Preston from the University of Bath, saying he \u201cspoke on television the other night\u201d. Phoenix says Dr Preston received a \u00a328 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which he claims is \u201cinterfering and trying to manipulate\u201d human vaccine trials.\n\nThere is no record of Dr Preston leading a trial of a COVID-19 vaccine. The trial of a COVID-19 vaccine in the UK has been run by a team at Oxford University.\n\nDr Preston has been in the media talking about vaccine development but as a commentator.\n\nThere is no evidence that Dr Preston received a \u00a328 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The 28 million figure may be drawn from an international whooping cough vaccine research project in which Dr Preston and Bath University are among 22 organisations involved. That project received a 28 million euro grant, \u20ac21 million of which came from the European Commission and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, with \u20ac7 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nThe video describes the claims as coming from \u201can alleged GSK insider\u201d who \u201cbelieves that certain antigens are going to appear in the vaccine\u201d (1m23s).\n\nThe speaker says, \u201cWe\u2019re one foot in this and one foot out but I\u2019m going to go through this and I\u2019m going to present it as though it\u2019s the truth, because I believe it is\u201d. (4m20s)\n\nReading from unidentified documents, the speaker says (4m37s) \u201cthere is going to be an anti-HCG antigen. Now this is, HCG is something for, um, causes sterility in women. It is also combined with HCG and OLH and 37 amino acid carboxy-terminal peptides \u2026 The principle of anti-hCG vaccine is to introduce antibodies which can bind to hCG and render it biologically inactive.\u201d\n\nThe statement that HCG causes sterility is incorrect. HCG is a hormone secreted during pregnancy.\n\nThe remainder of the statement matches almost verbatim part of an unrelated, 31-year-old review of anti-fertility vaccine research from the National Institute of Immunology in New Delhi, India.\n\nOther parts read from the documents also match the 1989 review paper, including: \u201cGnRH resulted in decreased testicular size, drop of testosterone levels, and marked atrophy of the prostate\u201d (5m51s) and \u201ca sperm-specific mitochondrial antigen, produced an antibody response in baboons and reduced fertility in the females\u201d. (6m37s)\n\nThe speaker also says that GSK tested 63 women with a vaccine containing anti-hGC antigens that resulted in 61 becoming infertile (5m29s). Those statistics also appear in the 1989 paper and an older one, by one of the same researchers and are not related to GSK.\n\nUniversity of Queensland Infectious Diseases Physician and Microbiologist Associate Professor Paul Griffin told AAP FactCheck the argument advanced in the video is \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d.\n\nProf Griffin said the 1989 paper referred to in the video \u201cwas obviously very deliberately about a vaccine for contraception or cancer research\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey picked together a few unrelated concepts in an implausible way to try and mount an argument, suggesting that a COVID vaccine was going to leave people infertile. There\u2019s just nothing to substantiate that,\u201d Prof Griffin said.\n\n\u201cVaccine ingredients are freely available, highly transparent and these days, the way we make vaccines is so specific, based on such good technology, that the prospect of a vaccine having collateral effects such as this is just not realistic.\u201d\n\nThe speaker also says in the video that there are separate vaccines for males and females.\n\nProf Griffin dismissed the suggestion, saying there is no difference for males and females for the effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\u201cFor something that we want an immunological response to protect from a pathogen, there\u2019s no sex difference based on that, so there\u2019s no suggestion we\u2019re going to have a male and a female COVID vaccine,\u201d he said.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the Facebook post to be false. The video refers to the claimed source as an \u201calleged whistleblower\u201d. The speaker says he is \u201cone foot in this and one foot out\u201d on the material but is presenting it as though it is true. The supposed information supplied by the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d is an almost verbatim match with an unrelated, 31-year-old paper about anti-fertility vaccine research in India.
