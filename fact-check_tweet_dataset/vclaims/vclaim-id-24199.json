His estate at Monticello calls the saying a \u201cspurious quotation.\u201d\n\nIn an attempt to promote the 2nd Amendment, the Facebook page relies on the authority of Jefferson, a revered founding father, for support. However, the expression does not appear in a database of Jefferson\u2019s quotes and letters, and neither does it appear in the \u201cPapers of Thomas Jefferson.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis quotation has not been found in any of the writings of Thomas Jefferson,\u201d reads the Monticello website, tracing the first known appearance in print back to a 1989 article in The Orlando Sentinel.\n\nAccording to Research Librarian Anna Berkes, the misattributed quote is sometimes prefaced with the sentence, \u201cNo freeman shall ever be debarred the use of arms.\u201d Jefferson did write that in a first draft of the Virginia Constitution. The phrase was not included in the adopted version of that constitution.", "lang": "en"}
