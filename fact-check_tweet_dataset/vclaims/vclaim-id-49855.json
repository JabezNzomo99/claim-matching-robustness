The incident is over four years old and it took place not in Kulgam, but in Dehradun, Uttarakhand. In December 2015, Dehradun police arrested eight people, including six women, for running a sex racket.\n\nThe archived versions of the posts are saved here and here.\n\nMultiple Facebook users have posted the same content, which can be seen here.\n\nWith the help of reverse image search, we found that this viral image has been used repeatedly over the years since 2015 in various online articles and websites.\n\nWe found a news report published on the news website \"The Tribune\" in December 2015.\n\nAccording to the news report, the Clement Town police of Dehradun arrested eight persons, including six women, for their alleged role in running a sex racket. The photo was taken by the Tribune news service.\n\nIt was revealed during investigation that the sex racket was being run on a rented accommodation of a retired Army officer.\n\nEarlier in 2018, there were news reports regarding a sex racket in Kulgam involving local Kashmiri girls and high-profile people.\n\nBut the viral picture showing men and women in covered faces is not from Kulgam but from Dehradun. The picture was taken in 2015.", "lang": "en"}
