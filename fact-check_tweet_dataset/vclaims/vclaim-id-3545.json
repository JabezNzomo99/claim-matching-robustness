The IFS puts this down to two key developments: the introduction of Right to Buy in 1980, which gave tenants the ability to buy their council houses at below market rates, and a general drop in the amount of social housing being built.\n\nThe number of homes for rent from councils or housing associations in the UK has been decreasing from a peak of around seven million in the early 1980s to just under five million in 2014.\n\nIn contrast the number of homes available for private rental has increased from around two million to over five million.\n\nSocial housing usually refers to homes rented at sub-market levels by councils and housing associations. \u201cSocial rent\u201d levels are around 50% of market levels. The government also includes \u201caffordable rent\u201d homes in its definition of social housing, these are up to 80% of market levels.\n\nThere were around 5,000 homes for social rent built or acquired in England in 2016/17 compared to 24,000 for affordable rent.\n\nAffordable rent properties were first introduced in 2011 and since then their number has increased significantly while the number of social rent properties has decreased.\n\nWe\u2019ve written more about how affordable housing is, and house building in England more generally elsewhere.", "lang": "en"}
