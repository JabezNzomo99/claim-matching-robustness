In the April 2016 photo, the woman was not holding a rope or noose; posts then implied Roxas was saddened by the supposed meager number of supporters who attended his campaign rally in Hong Kong.\n\nA GMA News Online report quotes Marites Palma, who said she was the woman in the photo, debunking the claim:\n\nRoxas finished outside the winning 12 Senate slots with 9.8 million votes.\n\nCrabbler appears to be a satire page imitating tsek.ph partner Rappler, using a similar logo. It also has a news blog. Both platforms do not contain disclaimers on the truthfulness of their content.\n\nThe photo had 2,329 interactions on Crabbler and Pinoy Monkey Pride, another Facebook page.\n\nLavina, P. T.
