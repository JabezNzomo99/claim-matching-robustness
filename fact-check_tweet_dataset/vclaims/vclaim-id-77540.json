They live in it because he's the principal of Phillips Exeter Academy, one of the country's most exclusive prep schools in the country.\n\nHassan's camp maintains the ad tries to give the impression that she is a property tax scofflaw when in fact she's not.\n\nFive days after the RGA ad came out, the Hassan campaign came back with its own ad titled \"Action,\" which opens with the same image of the home and explains the school ownership.\n\nUndeterred, the RGA through its Live Free PAC put up a second commercial titled \"Hiding\" with Hassan's home on it, and went back to the well.\n\n\"Maggie Hassan admits she pays zero property taxes on her half-million dollar home,\" it declares.\n\n\"Maggie Hassan pays no property taxes, but she likes high taxes for us.\"\n\nRGA Communications Director Michael Schrimpf said his group's researchers went through property assessment records in Exeter and found out the Hassans paid no property taxes.\n\nPhillips Exeter officials confirmed that Tom Hassan's contract requires that he live on campus in this home and that it be open and available for many school functions.\n\nThe home is valued at $545,900 by the town and is one of the school\u2019s tax-exempt properties. If someone was paying taxes on it, the bill would be about $12,350 a year.\n\nPrivate school property is tax-exempt on buildings used for instruction or administration. The Hassan residence qualifies under administration because the principal lives there. School officials listed the property on its tax-exempt application and the town approved.\n\nPhillips Exeter Director of Communications Julie Quinn said the private school is still the largest property taxpayer in town paying $772,946 a year on parcels that are not tax-exempt such as dining halls and dormitories.\n\nOn top of claiming Hassan pays no property taxes, the RGA ad also declares Hassan likes taxing everybody else.\n\nAs PolitiFact noted in a previous checkon a Lamontagne claim that Hassan was a big spender during her time in office from 2004-2010, total state spending went up by 20 percent during that period. But looking at funds spent from state taxes and fees, spending actually went down, since the Democrats twice reopened the budget to make cuts.\n\nIt\u2019s also true that when the 2010-11 state budget was out of balance, Gov. John Lynch and the Legislature, including Hassan, approved two bills that included revenue-raising taxes and fees that totaled more than $260 million.\n\nWhile it's true the Hassans pay no property taxes, it\u2019s for good reason. She does not own the home she lives in. It\u2019s owned by Phillips Exeter Academy where her husband Tom is principal and he is required to live in the home. The building is one of the school\u2019s tax exempt properties, but Phillips Exeter is still the town\u2019s largest taxpayer.\n\nThe ad by the Republican Governor\u2019s Association gives the impression that she's evading her own taxes while supporting increased taxes \"for the rest of us.\" The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim to be Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
