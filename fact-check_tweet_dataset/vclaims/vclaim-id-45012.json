With 17,386 confirmed cases as of May 30, the national capital now has third largest number of Coronavirus positive patients in the country. According to news reports, on May 29 Delhi reported more than 1000 COVID-19 cases for the second consecutive day. Maharashtra still has the highest number of positive cases in the country.\n\nThe 90-second-long viral clip, recorded on a mobile phone, shows the miserable conditions of a COVID-19 ward. Patients can be seen on gurneys while a woman, speaking to the camera, points out at least four dead bodies lying in the ward. The woman also claims that patients are being made to sleep on the floor while bodies lie on gurneys. Towards the end, the woman speaking in Hindi can be clearly heard telling the person filming the video 'Go out and upload it on Facebook. Tag KEM hospital'.\n\nThe clip has been shared with a Hindi caption which translates to 'Be ashamed, Kejriwal. It's too much now. If you cannot manage, accept it.
