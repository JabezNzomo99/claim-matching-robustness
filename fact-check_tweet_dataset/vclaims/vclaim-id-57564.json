Yes, that's true: the Secure 5G and Beyond Act of 2020 was signed on March 23, 2020, but a video detailing the potential fallout of expanding 5G technology is exaggerated.\n\nThe claim came from a video (archived here) where it was published by The Last American Vagabond on March 26, 2020, under the title \"5G Bill Signed Into Law While Everyone Is Distracted By Coronavirus.\" It opened:\n\nThat is true. The White House announced the bill via press release on March 23. Ryan Cristian, the host of the YouTube show, quotes directly from the press release to introduce the topic.\n\nCristian then says that it's alarming that the president is signing this bill into law while Americans may not be aware of what 5G technology is, how it affects them and how it will be regulated. Cristian says:\n\nCristian then moves to citing an article by Children's Health Defense, asking California Gov. Gavin Newsom to stop expanding 5G infrastructure in in schools, especially during the COVID-19 quarantine. The state went under a stay-at-home order on March 19.\n\nThe Children's Health Defense article links to another article by Military News that it supposedly cites when Newsom announced \"his intention to expand the deployment of wireless infrastructure in schools, during the COVID-19 quarantine.\"\n\nBut the link only brings readers to an unrelated article that was pulled from Los Angeles Times reporter Taryn Luna.\n\nThe Children's Health Defense website also frequently populates anti-vaccine content. The non-profit organization is run by Robert F. Kennedy, who has previously been accused of disseminating false and misleading information about health and vaccines.\n\nYet Cristian cites the Children's Health Defense site in his video:\n\nAnd while some local leaders in California towns have advocated for keeping areas that are heavily populated by children off of developer's lists for wireless towers that can access the 5G networks, there haven't been recent reports of 5G installations in schools.\n\nCristian then aims to show a laundry list of symptoms associated with 5G exposure, citing only one article written by the CEO of Shield Your Body, a company that sells various forms of tech covers and clothing that block out EMF radiation.\n\nBut an international radiation watchdog, along with several researchers and news outlets have concluded that 5G is safe at the level its being used in practice, according to The Guardian:\n\nIt is worth noting that the actual study conducted by ICNIRP found, in summary, that there is no evidence for compromised health at certain levels:\n\nCristian also cites the same Shield Your Body article, which claims the International Agency for Research on Cancer designated 5G radiation as a class 2B carcinogen. That's true, but the claim also lacks a bit of context.\n\nA class 2B carcinogen means a substance is possibly carcinogenic to humans, according to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry:\n\nAnd a lot of things are classified as class 2B carcinogens like aloe vera or pickled vegetables. So being exposed to a 2B carcninogen -- and those far more threatening -- is not uncommon.\n\nHe also cites an article by howtogeek.com, but only selectively reads a part of the article that says \"radiofrequency radiation that can damage DNA and lead to cancer; cause oxidative damage that can cause premature aging; disrupt cell metabolism; and potentially lead to other diseases through the generation of stress proteins.\"\n\nBut the full quote actually attributes this opinion to outsiders:\n\nAnd the same article seems to assert the opposite opinion expressed by the video's excerpt:\n\nSo the consensus seems to be that there's the potential for hazard, but not enough research or evidence can confirm that 5G is cause for alarm as a public health threat.\n\u2022 Fact Check: 5G Technology NOT Believed To Have Caused Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: There Is NO Evidence The Illuminati Controlled The U.S. Government, And Coronavirus' Is NOT Caused By 5G\n\u2022 Fact Check: Video Does NOT Show 5G Installation At Texas School\n\u2022 Fact Check: There Is NO Evidence Of Worldwide COVID-19 Conspiracy Involving U.S. Government, Its Military, 5G Tech And The Illuminati", "lang": "en"}
