Obama has also kept in place virtually all of the Bush-era tax cuts that Democrats had once vowed to overturn, with only rates jumping for the wealthiest Americans.\n\n\u2018More men and women are out of work than ever before in our nation\u2019s history\u2019\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics every month produces a data point labeled \u201cnot in labor force,\u201d which includes persons aged 16 years and older in the civilian noninstitutional population who are neither employed nor unemployed. As of January, the number was 94.062 million, a slight decrease from the high reached in November of 94.38 million. (Technically, then, the Rubio claim is a couple of months out of date.)\n\nBut the other 84 million are simply not in the labor force\u2014and almost always by choice. Most are simply retired, a number that grows by 10,000 people a day as the Baby Boom generation retires. After all, the oldest baby boomers (those born in 1946) became eligible for early Social Security benefits at age 62 in 2008 and reached full retirement age at 66 in 2012.\n\nBut the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago in 2012 concluded that just over half of the post-1999 decline in the participation rate comes from the retirement of the baby boomers. Barclays economists, meanwhile, say that just 15 percent of the drop in the labor force stems from people who want a job and are of prime working age (25-54).\n\nIn any case, it is simply false to assert that people are \u201cout of work\u201d when they are not seeking work in the first place. Retirees, students and stay-at-home parents are simply not part of the active work force. It\u2019s especially strange to make this claim when the official unemployment rate is so low.\n\n\u2018People paying more in taxes than they will for food, housing and clothing combined\u2019\n\nBut this is a misleading comparison. As Republicans frequently\u2014and correctly\u2014note, the vast majority of taxes are paid by the wealthiest Americans; more than 40 percent of Americans pay no income tax. Thus aggregate numbers reflect little of the actual tax burden faced by most Americans\u2013or, as the ad puts it, \u201cpeople.\u201d\n\nThe Commerce data shows that spending on housing, food and clothing consumes about 28.5 percent of personal income. By contrast, the average federal tax rate for American households is about 18 percent, as of 2011, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Only the top one percent faces an average tax burden of more than 28 percent, according to TPC. (Indeed, for all but the top 20 percent, the average tax burden is 15 percent or less.) State and local taxes would add a bit to these numbers, but generally for all but the wealthiest Americans, the combined spending on clothing/food/housing would be higher than the tax burden.\n\nThe first statement\u2013\u201cmore people are out of work than ever before\u201d\u2013 is clearly worthy of four Pinocchios. Rubio should be ashamed to be wandering in Trump\u2019s statistical fantasyland. The second statement is between Two and Three Pinocchios, in that it is based on actual Commerce Department data, but misleadingly presented. Overall, this ad is worthy of Three Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
