New rumors have circulated on the Internet that Cyrus is now revisiting that promise and that Trump fans are ruining her career.\n\n\"Singer Miley Cyrus: \u2018Trump fans are destroying my career, I can\u2019t stand them and I decided to move to\u2026\u2019\" read the headline on Daily Washington Report, a blog providing no information about the nature of its content.\n\nThe story was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media\u2019s efforts to combat online hoaxes.\n\nThe story cites real quotes by Cyrus from an interview she gave to Billboard magazine in 2017 where she openly spoke about becoming more political following the 2016 election. But the story then makes up new information regarding comments about Trump supporters.\n\nIn the article, Cyrus claims to be dissatisfied with her career and blames Trump supporters for her not being a top-selling artist anymore. We found no evidence that Cyrus ever made those comments.\n\nCyrus is also falsely quoted as saying that she believes the amount of hate she has received has to do with Trump supporters and that she will leave the United States if it continues.

In that interview, she talked about expanding her career to work on different project, and being in a good place in her life right now.\n\nCyrus\u2019s latest album, Younger Now, released in September 2017, hit a peak of No. 3 on the Billboard charts.\n\nEven though last year Cyrus threatened to leave the United States if Trump was elected president, she recently backtracked, calling it \"ignorant\" to leave the country because of the president.\n\nA fake news story said that Miley Cyrus is blaming Trump supporters for her discontentment with her career and that she is planning to leave the United States.
