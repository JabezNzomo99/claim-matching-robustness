Rand Paul, R-Ky., has had a light schedule\n\nNBC Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked Paul why he hasn\u2019t hosted a public event since Dec. 16 in Nevada.\n\nPaul said he\u2019s been attending to other responsibilities, such as spending time with his family, performing pro-bono surgeries (he\u2019s an ophthalmologist), and hosting fundraisers \u2014 not to mention his job as a senator. Paul went after the voting records of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.\n\n\"I mean, I have a job as senator,\" Paul said Jan. 3. \"I'm one of the few of the candidates that actually shows up to vote. Both Cruz and Rubio are missing the vast majority of their votes. But I feel an obligation to the taxpayer that pays my salary.\"\n\nCritics have attacked Rubio\u2019s Senate voting record throughout the 2016 cycle, so we decided to dig in a little further and see how it compares to the records of Cruz and Paul.\n\nWe found that Paul far overstated when he said Cruz and Rubio missed \"the vast majority of their votes.\"\n\nPaul used his busy Senate schedule as an excuse for not hosting many campaign events in the latter half of December, but there wasn\u2019t too much going on at Capitol Hill during this time. The Senate has been in recess since Dec. 18 and won\u2019t be back in session until Jan. 11.\n\nPaul didn\u2019t specify a time frame, but his campaign sent over data for his, Cruz\u2019s and Rubio\u2019s Senate careers. We found the same data on the website GovTrack. In the chart below, we\u2019ve counted the career absentee rate for each of the current or former senators running for president.\n\nConcerning their career absentee rates, Rubio has the worst record, missing 13.3 percent of all votes. He\u2019s followed by Cruz at 12.4 percent and Clinton at 9.5 percent. Paul and Sanders have both missed closer to 4 percent.\n\nAll five are far away from the median career absentee rate for all current senators, 1.7 percent. Santorum comes close with 1.9 percent.\n\nHowever, no candidate has missed a \"vast majority\" of his or her votes.\n\nAnother way to interpret Paul\u2019s statement is that he is specifically referring to votes cast during the 2016 election cycle or in recent months. Here are the current senators\u2019 records from October through December of last year, as well as for 2015 as a whole. (We chose October through December because GovTrack breaks down its data into three-month periods.)\n\nBetween the months of October and December, specifically, Rubio did miss a majority of his votes, skipping 39 out of 67 total votes. Notably, Rubio missed the Dec. 18 final vote on a major spending bill, while Cruz and Paul both voted against it.\n\nHowever, Cruz did not miss a majority of his votes in that time period. Neither Cruz nor Rubio missed a majority in 2015 overall.\n\nPaul and Sanders have had a better voting record throughout the 2016 election so far than Cruz and Rubio, but Paul\u2019s statement inflates the gap.\n\nPaul said \"Rubio and Cruz are missing the vast majority of their votes\" in the Senate.\n\nPaul has a point that he has a better Senate voting record than Cruz and Rubio. And over the past three months, Rubio has missed a majority of his votes, skipping out on nearly 60 percent as he campaigns for president.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t hold for Rubio\u2019s 2015 record or his Senate career. And Cruz has not missed a majority of his votes over any of those time periods.\n\nPaul\u2019s criticism goes too far in saying both candidates are \"missing the vast majority of their votes,\" so we rate it Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
