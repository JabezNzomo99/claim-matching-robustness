But there is less to it than meets the eye.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2016-01-28T08:00:24Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-82768", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/01/28/did-the-15-richest-americans-gain-as-much-wealth-as-the-bottom-100-million/", "vclaim": "About a third of the billionaires became recently rich because of the computer and Internet boom, such as Bill Gates (Microsoft), Jeff Bezos (Amazon and also owner of The Washington Post), Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook), Larry Ellison (Oracle) and Larry Page and Sergey Brin (Google). Another group comes from prominent families such as the two Koch brothers and four members of the Walton family (Wal-Mart). From Wall Street, there\u2019s Warren Buffett and Michael Bloomberg. Finally, there\u2019s casino mogul Sheldon Adelson.\n\nSome of this wealth is quite recent. Zuckerberg is 31 and Facebook, started in his Harvard dorm room, was only three years old when Sanders became a senator in 2007. Indeed, for most of these billionaires, much of their wealth is tied to the stock value of their companies. So when the stock market rises, as it did between 2013 and 2015, so does their wealth.\n\nThe Sanders campaign took that $170 billion figure and compared it to a snapshot of the net worth of Americans. According to the Federal Reserve\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finance, the bottom 43 percent of Americans had a total net worth of $134 billion in 2013 (the latest available data). The bottom 43 percent is equal to approximately 138 million Americans. (The Institute of Policy Studies, via the Sanders campaign, provided a breakdown of the wealth percentiles from the survey on the condition we not publish the underlying data. )\n\nHence, the Sanders statistic emerges that the 15 wealthiest Americans gained as much net worth as bottom 100 million Americans combined. It\u2019s possible the disparity is even greater because the superwealthy have the tools to move assets off shore or into trusts that make it more difficult to track their net worth.\n\nBut there\u2019s less to this statistic than meets the eye. The bottom 15 percent of Americans have so much negative net worth that it takes many more Americans \u2014 approximately the bottom 40 percent \u2014until any overall positive net worth is recorded. Indeed, as our colleagues at FactCheck.org noted concerning a different Sanders claim, the lawmaker \u2014 who has a reported net worth of about $330,000 \u2014 by himself has more net worth than the bottom 40 percent.\n\n\u201cThe question as to whether total net worth is a distortion is a policy and political question,\u201d said Chuck Collins, who co-authored the Institute of Policy Studies report with Josh Hoxie, a former Sanders legislative aide. \u201cWe think it\u2019s relevant how many U.S. households have zero or negative net worth \u2014as well as how little net worth is possessed by households in the bottom 50-60 percent. It is a juxtaposition that we think dramatizes the extreme levels of inequality we are living in.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Forbes provides a day-by-day updating of the wealth of the wealthiest Americans. As of Jan. 26, it\u2019s clear that this group has lost ground in the last 10 months. Some people, such as Bezos, have seen big gains even with the recent stock market slump; he\u2019s added almost $17 billion to his net worth. But many others have lost billions, so that overall the net worth of the 15 wealthiest Americans has declined almost $35 billion. Under the logic of this ad, that is as much negative net worth as the bottom 39.5 percent.\n\n\u201cThe market has tanked since we ran this data and wealth has declined substantially since September for almost everyone, including some of our nation\u2019s billionaires,\u201d Collin acknowledged. \u201cSaying the short-term fluctuations in wealth for those at the top is equal to current negative wealth for those at the bottom conflates the point that the overall wealth for those at the top has been on upward trajectory for years and is extremely this trajectory, despite the short-term drop that Forbes reports.\u201d\n\nWe agree the wealth of the 15 richest Americans is certainly staggering. Another way to look at it is they have as much net worth as the bottom half of the American population.\n\nWe will leave it to readers to decide if this means the economy is \u201crigged\u201d\u2014or if innovative entrepreneurs simply have the ability today to earn vast sums of money. While Sanders says he wants to make the wealthy pay their fair share, it is worth noting that five members of this group \u2014 Gates, Buffett, Ellison, Bloomberg and Zuckerberg \u2014 have signed a pledge saying they will give up most of their wealth for philanthropic causes.\n\nThis is certainly an interesting statistic, and the math generally adds up. But we are going to give it a Pinocchio for the reasons noted above. The net worth of the bottom 40 percent is dragged down significantly by the negative net worth of the bottom 15 percent. Moreover, the wealth of the nation\u2019s billionaires is heavily impacted by the gyrations of stock market. Those caveats may be difficult to insert in a 30-second political ad, but it\u2019s important to keep them in mind.", "lang": "en"}
