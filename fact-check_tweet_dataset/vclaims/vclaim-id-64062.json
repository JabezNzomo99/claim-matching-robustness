Pence has stated he \u201ccan\u2019t wait\u201d to debate Harris.\n\nBiden announced the California senator as his pick for vice president on Aug. 11, The Washington Post reported. Since then, Harris has been the subject of several viral rumors, with this particular post claiming Pence said that he \u201cwon\u2019t debate Kamala.\u201d\n\nBut the Facebook post fails to provide a source for the claim, and the Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence Pence ever made this remark. Such a declaration would almost certainly have been covered by the media, yet no news reporting could be found to corroborate the claim. No similar comments appear on the vice president\u2019s verified social media accounts either.\n\nPence has publicly stated that he looks forward to debating Harris. In an Aug. 12 interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, Pence said, \u201cI think she is a skilled debater, but I can\u2019t wait to get to Salt Lake City and be on the stage with her, to compare Joe Biden\u2019s nearly 50 years in public life \u2013 the agenda of the radical left, the agenda that she\u2019s embraced throughout her political career \u2013 with the results of this president and this administration.\u201d\n\nFox News reported that Pence also made a similar remark the previous day at an event in Mesa, Arizona: \u201cSo my message to the Democratic nominee for vice president: Congratulations. I\u2019ll see you in Salt Lake City.\u201d (RELATED: Was Mike Pence Pictured Waving A Confederate Flag?)\n\nThe vice presidential debate is currently scheduled to take place at the University of Utah on Oct. 7 in Salt Lake City, according to CNN.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
