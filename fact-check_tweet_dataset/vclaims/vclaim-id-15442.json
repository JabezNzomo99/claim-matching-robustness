John McCain received a pardon from President Richard Nixon. He did not.\n\nWhen Sen. John McCain died last year, he was widely praised by military officials for his service to the U.S. \u2014 notably for his time in the Navy, during which the lieutenant commander was imprisoned in Vietnam for nearly five-and-a-half years.\n\nSecretary of the Navy Richard V. Spencer, for example, said in a statement that McCain was \u201crenowned as a hero\u201d and that \u201cfrom the Naval Academy to flight school and throughout his time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, McCain displayed unfailing honor and duty to country.\u201d\n\nBut attempts to rewrite history about the late Arizona Republican have continued months after his death. A falsehood that recently reappeared on Facebook suggests McCain had committed \u201ctreason\u201d during his service.\n\n\u201cFACT: If not for a pardon from President Richard Nixon, John McCain would have been court martialed for treason,\u201d text in the image reads, referencing the process through which military members are charged and tried for violations of military law.\n\nThe image, which appears to be a screenshot, closely mirrors a more detailed February 2017 post on a Facebook page called Bikers for America, which has tens of thousands of followers.\n\nThe pardon claim is easily disproved: A full list of pardons by Nixon is available on the Department of Justice website and there is no mention of McCain.\n\nMcCain was instead honored for his service: The Navy, for example, awarded him the Silver Star for his \u201cconspicuous gallantry\u201d while he was imprisoned. He also received the Distinguished Flying Cross, three Bronze Stars, two Purple Hearts and the Prisoner-of-War medal.\n\nThe black-and-white image of Nixon and McCain shaking hands in the bogus post matches an Associated Press photo that was taken at White House reception \u201chonoring former Vietnam prisoners of war\u201d in May 1973, according to the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum. The National Archives and Records Administration also has a color photo of the same encounter.\n\nThe falsehood tracks with other efforts to sully McCain\u2019s military record with erroneous accounts: Within days of his death we (again) debunked an erroneous claim that McCain was responsible for a 1967 accident that left more than 100 sailors dead. He wasn\u2019t.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nFaas, Horst. \u201cAP WAS THERE: John McCain released after 5\u00bd years as a POW.\u201d Associated Press. 27 Aug 2018.\n\n\u201cPardons granted by President Richard Nixon (1969-1974).\u201d Office of the Pardon Attorney, U.S. Department of Justice. 5 Jul 2017.\n\n\u201cU.S. Navy Statements on Passing of Sen.
