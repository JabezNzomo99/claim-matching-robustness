Unlike a poll of small-business owners that used random sampling, this type of targeted poll cannot be used to make claims about all small businesses (\u201cthe average small business\u201d); it reflects only the views of those who choose to participate.\n\nLooking at two other surveys from the NSBA help illustrate why this matters. Thirty-six percent of participants in a 2016 survey report having from one to five employees. In the 2017 survey, that number jumps to 48 percent, and dips to 44 percent in a 2018 survey. Of course membership levels fluctuate and businesses change, but these shifts are quite large, suggesting a significantly different picture of businesses that participate from year to year.\n\nRegardless, let\u2019s take a deeper look. As part of its advocacy mission, the association conducts several surveys each year to find quantitative support for issues relevant to its members. This particular survey was the first of its kind, apparently inspired by hearing from members that the daily cost of doing business was becoming burdensome. In other words, the survey began with an underlying assumption that regulations were costly.\n\nThe NSBA provided the survey to more than 45,000 business owners (or roughly one-eighth of 1 percent of all small businesses in the United States, according to the Small Business Administration) \u2014 and 998 responded, or about 2.2 percent. In this case, the report says 27 percent of respondents had gross revenue between $1 million and $5 million and nearly half employed between one and five people.\n\nFor the purposes of this survey, the association defines regulation as anything the government requires a business to do. That means questions varied dramatically \u2014 from ranking \u201chow burdensome\u201d the federal tax code is to the burden of the clean-water rules or state licensing requirements. It also combines current and proposed regulations into one speculative category. Molly Day, the NSBA\u2019s vice president of public affairs, said the range of regulations included in the survey were decided by the association\u2019s veteran staff members and member-driven oversight committees.\n\nParticipants were asked to self-report a \u201creasonable\u201d estimate of the amount their business spent on regulations in its first year. Day said the organization compiled the data, removed any clear outliers (anything far exceeding $5 million) and then averaged the remaining numbers in order to determine the average amount a small business spends to comply with federal and state regulations. Before publication, the results were reviewed by a committee of veteran small-business owners.\n\nThe report also says that the \u201caverage\u201d small business owner spends $12,000 per year on regulations. It is unclear what accounts for the $71,000 difference with the claim that first-year costs amount to an average of $83,000. Looking at the U.S. Small Business Administration\u2019s calculator for start-up costs, only a few of the budget areas it lists \u2014 permits, legal fees, accounting, insurance and organizational dues \u2014 can generally be considered costs caused by complying to regulations.\n\nWe also asked the NSBA for a breakdown of how long respondent\u2019s businesses had been open. Presumably, the cost to start a business 10 years ago differs from 10 months ago, and the more recently a company was started, the more accurate the owner\u2019s estimate. But on this survey, the NSBA said it did not ask that question.\n\nHowever, for a rough idea, they pointed us to two of the association\u2019s other surveys with similar demographic breakdowns, which showed on average respondents had been in business for more than 12 years. It also showed that nearly half had been in business for more than 20 years. Moreover, the estimates were not weighted or broken down by business type or size of business. After all, it\u2019s unlikely that a small team of Realtors and a fine dining restaurant would have similar start-up costs.\n\nAnother oddity: 43 percent of respondents said the Affordable Care Act was \u201cvery burdensome,\u201d and 23 percent said it was \u201csomewhat burdensome.\u201d That adds up to 76 percent of those responding. But 82 percent of those responding have fewer than 20 employees \u2014 and the ACA applies only if a business has 50 or more employees. That suggests that some of the regulatory burdens are more imaginary than real.(NSBA notes that many small businesses with fewer than 50 employees offer insurance and could have been impacted by the ACA.)\n\nA White House official defended the president\u2019s use of this survey, noting the survey previously had been cited by media outlets including CNBC and Investors Business Daily. \u201cThe President cited a survey from a nonpartisan organization; these results were widely featured by mainstream media outlets highlighting the burdensome regulations that face small businesses across the country,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s economic policies have given hope to small-business owners and those who dream of starting their own businesses.\u201d\n\nAs always, the burden of accuracy is on the speaker. Trump (and his staff) should steer clear of this kind of survey \u2014 regardless of whether they support an argument. He cannot say that the results represent an \u201caverage small business,\u201d as the survey was not a random sample. We were torn between Two and Three Pinocchios, but ultimately the overly simple calculations and Trump\u2019s eagerness to tout numbers that support his concern about regulations pushed us to Three.", "lang": "en"}
