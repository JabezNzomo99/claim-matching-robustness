The incident took place in an area that comes under Gangaghat police station. -translated)\u201d\n\nThe above message is circulating on social media with a photo of an injured man. One Shahnawaz Ansari posted the same on twitter.\n\nSeveral other users have posted the same image on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nOn WhatsApp, a few people have asked Alt News to verify the claim.\n\nAlt News found the contact details of Jitendra Yadav, the proprietor of King\u2019s ice-cream, inscribed on the top of the kiosk seen in the image below. Yadav informed us that the ice-cream seller managing the truck and who was beaten up is not Rakesh but Harishankar Verma, a resident of Shuklaganj, Unnao district in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nIn conversation with Alt News, Yadav said, \u201cIt was an altercation related to a personal matter that was later resolved. Someone gave a communal angle after 3-4 days of the incident. They are saying that he is Rakesh Dalit but his name is Harishankar. It is not what they are saying on social media.\u201d\n\nYadav also got us in contact with Harishankar Verma\u2019s son, Avadhesh. He too rubbished the claim circulating along with his father\u2019s photo. Avadhesh said, \u201cWe had initially shared the photo on WhatsApp to get it published as news but then somebody posted it on Facebook with a false claim. My father was on his way to our home with his ice-cream kiosk. He was standing near a shop having a conversation with someone when a guy named Deepak came up to him and started a fight after intervening in the conversation. I found my father injured after an hour of the incident. He was soon hospitalised. Now, they are circulating it with a fake narrative.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether he has filed an FIR, Avadhesh replied, \u201cBefore we could file an FIR, the man [Deepak] approached us and said that he is ready to pay for the medication cost and regrets the mistake.My father didn\u2019t want to take it further.\u201d\n\nAlt News also contacted Gangaghat police station and SO Shyam Kumar Pal said, \u201cWe have not received any complaint on the issue.\u201d\n\nIn conclusion, a photo of an injured man clicked after a brawl in Unnao district, Uttar Pradesh, was circulated on social media with a communal narrative that an ice-cream seller was beaten up by \u201csaffron terrorists\u201d on refusing to chant \u2018Jai Shri Ram\u2019.", "lang": "en"}
