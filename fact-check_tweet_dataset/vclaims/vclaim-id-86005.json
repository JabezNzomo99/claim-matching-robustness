We often point to the fascinating story of the creation of Medicaid, detailed in a 1993 article by former White House aide Joseph A. Califano Jr., which unexpectedly has led to one-third of the Medicaid budget today going to nursing homes. That\u2019s an excellent example of a good intentions and congressional deal-making gone awry. More than 30,000 people have read this article since we first posted it on Scribd last year.\n\nBut DeMint gets into trouble when he starts tossing around 50-year old figures and compares them to today\u2019s numbers. There is, for instance, something called inflation which makes these numbers not easily comparable. In the 1970s, inflation hit double digits, which is why most budget experts compare budget figures over time by using a metric such as a percentage of the overall economy or payroll costs or something else that allows for apples-to-apples comparisons.\n\nLet\u2019s take the first figure \u2014 that the Medicare Part A budget in 1990 is six to seven times higher than originally estimated. In February 1994, after Texas billionaire Ross Perot used this figure in a debate with then-Vice President Al Gore, Robert J. Myers wrote an article for the newsletter of the Society of Actuaries explaining the problems with this figure.\n\nIn the article, Myers is forthright about the fact that he underestimated the potential costs, but he says that inflation in the 1970s makes a dollar comparison fairly useless. Instead, he says the best approach is to compare costs as a percentage of taxable payroll. Thus, his original estimate was that the cost would be 1.61 percent of taxable payroll in 1990, whereas it turned out to be 2.41 percent. Thus the ratio of actual adjusted outgo, as a percentage of taxable payroll, is 150 percent higher, though he makes some other adjustments to account for changes in the law and ultimately arrives at a figure of 164 percent. (Note: as readers have pointed out, this translates into a difference of 64 percent.)\n\nThat\u2019s not great, he admits, but it\u2019s very different than 644 percent. \u201cA deviation such as this is nothing to be proud about; it is, however, much better than that based on the dollar values alone,\u201d wrote Myers, who was president of the Society of Actuaries in 1971-72. \u201cNonetheless, the only thing for me to do now is to commit bah-kari!\u201d\n\nAs for DeMint\u2019s other figure, he uses the slippery word \u201clikewise\u201d to suggest that his next figure is a similar comparison. But what he is actually doing is plucking a 1965 figure \u2014 $500 million a year \u2014 and suggesting that was also a prediction for 1990. The quote \u2014 that Medicare Part B would require \u201cfederal appropriations of about $500 million a year from general tax revenues\u201d \u2014 is not from a budget document but appears to come from an obscure and relatively minor New York Times article that appeared on March 11, 1965. But it was not a 50-year estimate, like the previous statistic.\n\nCalifano also mentions the $500 million number in his article. He says that this was the price of getting the Medicare bill out of the Senate Finance Committee \u2014 to \u201cagree to pay hospitals on a cost-plus basis, and doctors\u2019 fees that were \u2018reasonable,\u2019 \u2018customary\u2019 and \u2018prevailing\u2019 in their communities, thereby giving physicians the power to raise their own fees.\u201d\n\nFor the Pinocchio test, DeMint\u2019s assertions pose an interesting question. On the one hand, it is broadly correct that original estimates of the costs of Medicare were too low. Certainly, as Califano noted, there were unintended consequences to legislative deals made to get the bill through Congress that ended up burdening the U.S. Treasury.\n\nAt the same time, DeMint\u2019s figures are ridiculously overstated. He preferred to use trumped-up stats rather than refer to the concrete examples cited by Califano. As a general proposition, comparing estimates over nearly a half century is a bit of a fool\u2019s errand, as the world of 1965 is so different from today. It reminds us a bit of Mitt Romney\u2019s efforts to compare today\u2019s Navy to the Navy of 1916 by counting ships \u2014 gunboats versus aircraft carriers.\n\nIn researching this column, we found that DeMint\u2019s numbers are not particularly original and have been recycled over the years by various skeptics of major changes in the health-care system. He could have made his points without relying on such tendentious numbers. It\u2019s time to retire them, and so DeMint earns Three Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
