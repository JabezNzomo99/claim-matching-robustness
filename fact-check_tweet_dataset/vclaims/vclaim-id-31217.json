So, somebody ought to look into that.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump is under fire for having repeatedly raised Joe Biden, a possible opponent in the 2020 presidential race, in a July conversation with Ukraine\u2019s president at a time when the struggling nation expected to receive military aid for its nascent war against Russia on its eastern border. (The aid eventually arrived after demands from Congress.) The same conversation appears to figure in a whistleblower complaint from the intelligence community, but the details are not entirely clear because the administration has blocked the sharing of information about the complaint with Congress despite apparent requirements under the law.\n\nThis is one of those vast and complex stories that consume Washington but frequently confuse ordinary Americans. The Trump White House appears to be counting on that confusion to offer a fog of claims and allegations to make it appear as if Biden had done something wrong.\n\nOn top of that, Trump is arguing that because Biden said he withheld aid from Ukraine in the name of battling corruption, there\u2019s nothing wrong with Trump withholding aid from the same country in the name of fighting corruption (i.e., Biden was involved in supposedly corrupt dealings and should be investigated).\n\nTrump has claimed that Biden in 2015 pressured the Ukrainian government to fire Viktor Shokin, the top Ukrainian prosecutor, because he was investigating a Ukrainian gas producer, Burisma Holdings, that had added Biden\u2019s son Hunter to its board. But it turns out that the investigation had already been shelved when Biden acted and may have even involved a side company, not Burisma. The Ukrainian prosecutor was regarded as a failure, and \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s efforts to oust Shokin were universally praised,\u201d said Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist heavily involved in Eastern European market reforms.\n\nBiden lied about talking to his son\n\nIs that a substantive discussion or not? We will leave it to readers to decide, but it\u2019s a thin reed on which to hang the label of \u201clie.\u201d In any case, Biden never said he spoke to his son, as Trump claimed he did.\n\nBiden was \u2018disgraceful\u2019 when he bragged about holding back the funds\n\n\u201cI remember going over, convincing our team \u2026 that we should be providing for loan guarantees. \u2026 And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from [then Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko] and from [then-Prime Minister Arseniy] Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor [Shokin]. And they didn\u2019t\u2026They were walking out to a press conference. I said, \u2018Nah, \u2026 We\u2019re not going to give you the billion dollars.\u2019 They said, \u2018You have no authority. You\u2019re not the president.\u2019 \u2026 I said, \u2018Call him.\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars.\u2019 \u2026 I looked at them and said, \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money.\u2019 Well, son of a b----. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\u201d\n\nBloomberg reported that \u201cthe U.S. plan to push for Shokin\u2019s dismissal didn\u2019t initially come from Biden, but rather filtered up from officials at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation.\u201d In the same month Biden traveled to Ukraine, Bloomberg also reported, \u201chundreds of Ukrainians demonstrated outside President Petro Poroshenko\u2019s office demanding Shokin\u2019s resignation, and he was dismissed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis decision creates an opportunity to make a fresh start in the prosecutor general\u2019s office. I hope that the new prosecutor general will ensure that [his office] becomes independent from political influence and pressure and enjoys public trust,\u201d Jan Tombinski, the European Union\u2019s envoy to Ukraine, said in a statement when the firing was announced. The statement decried the \u201clack of tangible results of investigations into serious cases.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when exactly this conversation took place but it appears to have been during a visit by Biden to Ukraine in December, 2015, when he spoke to the Parliament and decried the \u201ccancer of corruption\u201d in the country. \"The Office of the General Prosecutor desperately needs reform,\u201d he noted. Shokin was removed from office in mid-March and Biden and Poroshenko announced on April 15 the loan guarantee would go forward; the agreement between the United States and Ukraine was signed on June 3. Biden\u2019s account to the Council on Foreign Relations appears to squeeze months of negotiations into a few hours.", "lang": "en"}
