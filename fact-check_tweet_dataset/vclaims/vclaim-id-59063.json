The quote attributed to the researchers appears only in articles about the alleged death.\n\nOxford University confirmed the information in the article was incorrect and Dr Granato remains alive and well.\n\nThis was also corroborated by BBC journalist Fergus Walsh, who said he had spoken to her on Sunday morning. The article was first published on Saturday.\n\nThe website, News NT, has been found to post false stories before, including a claim that 21 million people had died from coronavirus in China. The author, James Alami, does not appear to have a digital presence outside this website.\n\nThe trial which Dr Granato took part in involves more than 800 people, half of which were injected with the Covid-19 vaccine and half with a control vaccine which is effective against meningitis, but not coronavirus. She took part in the trial on 23 April.\n\nThis news article is not accurate. Oxford University has confirmed that the story was incorrect and Dr Granato remains alive and well.\n\nFerret Fact Service (FFS) is a non-partisan fact checker, working to the International Fact-Checking Network fact-checkers\u2019 code of principles.
