This is denied both in the White House and in the Kremlin.\u201d\n\nThe RIA Novosti report quoted Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov as calling the election interference allegations \u201cabsolutely unfounded.\u201d It also quoted Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as saying there are \u201cno facts confirming election meddling\u201d.\n\nRia Novosti concluded: \u201cSo far, no one has cited any evidence.\u201d\n\nFirst: The Russian claim that U.S. intelligence agencies have accused Russia of having links with Trump is false.\n\nIn January 2017, the U.S. Intelligence Community issued a declassified assessment of \u201cRussian activities and intentions\u201d in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The assessment, drafted and coordinated among three U.S. agencies \u2013 the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the National Security Agency (NSA) -- concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election with the goals of undermining public faith in the democratic process and harming Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201celectability and potential presidency.\u201d\n\nIt also concluded that Putin and his government \u201cdeveloped a clear preference for President-elect Trump.\u201d All three agencies had \u201chigh confidence\u201d in these judgements.\n\nIn addition, the three U.S. agencies concluded that Putin and the Russian government \u201caspired to help President-elect Trump\u2019s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him.\u201d The CIA and the FBI expressed \u201chigh confidence\u201d in this judgement, while the NSA expressed \u201cmoderate confidence.\u201d\n\nIn May 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate \u201cany links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump, and any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\u201d\n\nVarious U.S. congressional committees have also been investigating these and other matters related to Russian interference in the 2016 elections. In March 2018, the House Intelligence Committee issued a report stating that Russia \u201cbegan engaging in a covert influence campaign aimed at the U.S. Presidential election\u2026at the direction of Vladimir Putin.\u201d The report stated there as \u201cno evidence that the Trump campaign colluded\u201d with Russia. No Democrats joined Republicans in the language, Democrats issuing their own report citing \u201cnumerous meetings and contacts between Trump officials\u2026and representatives of the Russian government\u2026\u201d Lawmakers in the Senate and the House have said their investigations will continue.\n\nNext, the Russian claim that the White House has refuted Russia\u2019s election meddling allegations is false, though mixed messages from Trump have led to confusion concerning official policy.\n\nDuring a September 2016 presidential debate with Hillary Clinton, then-candidate Trump said: \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody knows if it was Russia who broke into the DNC [Democratic National Committee].\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, okay?\u201d\n\nIn April 2017, Trump returned to that framing of events, telling John Dickerson on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation television program: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to say who did the hacking. With that being said, I\u2019ll go along with Russia. It could have been China. It could have been a lot of different groups.\u201d\n\nIn February 2018, Trump tweeted he had never denied Russia meddled in the 2016 election, saying rather it could be another country or group, adding: \u201cThe Russian \u2018hoax\u2019 was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did!\u201d\n\nSpeaking jointly with Putin in Helsinki, Finland on July 16, 2018, Trump said that U.S. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and \u201csome others\u201d had come to him and expressed the view that Russia had hacked the Democratic National Committee\u2019s email server.\n\n\u201cI have President Putin; he just said it\u2019s not Russia,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI will say this: I don\u2019t see any reason why it would be, but I really do want to see the server.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Trump said he had meant to say he didn\u2019t see any reason why it \u201cwouldn\u2019t\u201d be Russia.\n\n\u201cI have on numerous occasions noted our intelligence findings that Russia attempted to interfere in our elections,\u201d Trump said.\n\nOn July 17, 2018, the White House issued a statement headlined \u201cPresident Donald J. Trump is Protecting Our Elections and Standing Up to Russia\u2019s Malign Activities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Trump Administration has maintained the closure of 2 Russian compounds and the expulsion of 35 diplomats in response to Russian interference in the 2016 election,\u201d the statement read.\n\nThose measures were initiated by outgoing President Barack Obama in December 2016.\n\nThe following week, Trump further muddied the waters by tweeting:\n\n\u201cSo President Obama knew about Russia before the Election. Why didn\u2019t he do something about it? Why didn\u2019t he tell our campaign? Because it is all a big hoax, that\u2019s why, and he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win!!!\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders subsequently clarified that Trump was talking about \u201cthe collusion component.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce again, the President has faith in the intelligence that suggest and maintain that Russia was involved in the elections,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nThe following day, Trump tweeted he was \u201cvery concerned that Russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming [midterm] election.\u201d Saying no president had been tougher on Russia than him, Trump added that Russia \u201cwill be pushing very hard for the Democrats. They definitely don\u2019t want Trump!\u201d\n\nOn August 2, Trump\u2019s national security team, including DNI Dan Coats, national security advisor John Bolton, FBI Director Christopher Wray, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and National Security Agency Director Paul Nakasone, held a press briefing in which they discussed \u201cpervasive\u201d Russian efforts to interfere in U.S. elections.\n\nOn September 12, Trump signed an executive order to help identify and punish any foreign power behind election meddling efforts.\n\nSo while Trump\u2019s public comments have clearly lead to some confusion over the White House\u2019s position on Russian interference in the 2016 election, the administration has not denied the fact that such meddling took place.\n\nTherefore, Polygraph finds RIA Novosti\u2019s statement to be false.", "lang": "en"}
