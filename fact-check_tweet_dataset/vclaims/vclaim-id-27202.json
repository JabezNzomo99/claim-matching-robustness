But that review was not his \u201cfirst order\u201d; it was not unexpected; and it won\u2019t be done until the end of the year, so it has yet to result in any improvements.\n\nAll U.S. presidents since Bill Clinton have undertaken Nuclear Posture Reviews, or NPRs, at the beginning of their administrations. The Obama administration\u2019s review, which was completed in April 2010, resulted in a $400 billion modernization plan that includes new nuclear submarines, intercontinental ballistic missiles and Air Force bombers.\n\n\u201cThe renovation and modernization of the arsenal that is going on now is all the result of decisions that were made by the Obama administration,\u201d Hans M. Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, told us. \u201cThe Trump administration NPR might decide to adjust or increase capabilities but that is yet unclear.\u201d\n\nTrump appeared to be alluding to U.S. nuclear weapons on Aug. 8, when he was asked about North Korea\u2019s missile tests and nuclear ambitions. \u201cNorth Korea best not make any more threats to the United States,\u201d Trump told reporters (at about the 4:30 mark). \u201cThey will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.\u201d\n\nA day later, Trump boasted that he has taken steps to \u201crenovate and modernize\u201d the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons program, which he said is \u201cnow far stronger\u201d than ever.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at the order that Trump issued \u201cto renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal.\u201d\n\nTrump issued a presidential memorandum on Jan. 27 that, among other things, directed the secretary of defense to initiate a Nuclear Posture Review \u201cto ensure that the United States nuclear deterrent is modern, robust, flexible, resilient, ready, and appropriately tailored to deter 21st-century threats and reassure our allies.\u201d\n\nSuch a review is not unusual. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, every incoming U.S. president has conducted a Nuclear Posture Review at the beginning of their administrations. So Trump is no different in that respect.\n\nThe Defense Department officially began its review on April 17, and it is expected to be completed by the end of the year \u2014 so Trump\u2019s order has not made the U.S. nuclear arsenal \u201cfar stronger and more powerful than ever.\u201d\n\nIt also wasn\u2019t his \u201cfirst order.\u201d Trump\u2019s first executive order was on the Affordable Care Act, and the first presidential memorandum was about regulations. Both were issued on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20. That first presidential memo was issued by his chief of staff. The first presidential memo signed by Trump came three days later on Jan. 23, and it dealt with abortion.\n\nTodd Harrison, a defense budget analyst who heads the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in an interview that he did not see \u201chow there is any factual basis to support\u201d the president\u2019s tweet.\n\n\u201cClearly this was not, literally, his first order \u2026 and nothing has changed in the nuclear arsenal,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cTo be fair, even if he wanted to make changes nothing would have changed by now.\u201d\n\nThere is an ongoing modernization of the U.S. nuclear weapons program, but it was initiated under Obama, not Trump.\n\nRobert Gates, Obama\u2019s defense secretary, released his department\u2019s Nuclear Posture Review on April 6, 2010. The report called for \u201cmuch-needed investments to rebuild America\u2019s aging nuclear infrastructure.\u201d It also concluded that the United States will maintain a triad of nuclear weapon systems on land (intercontinental ballistic missiles), sea (submarine-launched ballistic missiles) and air (nuclear-capable heavy bombers).\n\nAfter the report was issued, the Obama administration began making plans to modernize the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons program. In 2013, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the modernization program would cost about $355 billion over 10 years, from 2014-2023. It has since increased that estimate to $400 billion over 10 years, from 2017 to 2026. Those estimates include maintenance and operation costs, as well as modernization costs. Over 30 years, the cost could reach $1 trillion, according to the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies.\n\nThe Defense Department is now in the early stages of modernizing its fleet of nuclear submarines, Air Force bombers and land-based missiles:\n\u2022 In January 2011, the Navy began a program to replace its Ohio-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines with a new fleet dubbed the Columbia that will cost more than $100 billion, according to a March 2017 report (page 117) by the Government Accountability Office.\n\u2022 In October 2015, the Defense Department announced that Northrop Grumman won the contract to build a new long-range bomber \u2014 the B-21 \u2014 that is capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear weapons. The new fleet will replace the aging B-52 and B-1 bombers under a contract that is expected to exceed $55 billion, according to Defense News.\n\u2022 In July 2016, the Air Force issued a request for proposal for the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent intercontinental ballistic missile weapon system to replace the aging land-based Minuteman III ICBMs.\n\nKristensen told us that the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear review also resulted in plans to extend the life of existing programs, such as the B61-12 nuclear gravity bomb, and modernize \u201ckey early-warning and nuclear command and control facilities and capabilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration set in motion an incredibly ambitious and expensive set of programs to maintain and upgrade the U.S. nuclear arsenal,\u201d Kingston Reif, director for Disarmament and Threat Reduction Policy at the Arms Control Association, told us in an email. \u201cMost of these programs are still in their early stages of development.\u201d\n\nReif added that \u201cthe Trump administration\u2019s first budget request submitted in May for fiscal year 2018 largely continues the existing Obama programs of record.\u201d\n\nAs for whether the U.S. nuclear arsenal is \u201cnow far stronger and more powerful than ever,\u201d as Trump said, Kristensen responded: \u201cThe arsenal has just about the same capability today as it did when Trump took office. Same weapons. Same readiness level. Same strike plans.\u201d\n\nCorrection, Aug. 11: An earlier version of this article misidentified the military branch that operates the long-range bombers. It is the Air Force.", "lang": "en"}
