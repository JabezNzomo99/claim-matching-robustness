We compared it with an official circular released by the CBSE on Wednesday, 8 July and noticed that the signature of CBSE secretary in the viral circular looked morphed or copied. If one looks at it carefully, it can be seen that the background colour of the signature is different as compared to the white background of the viral circular in question. In the official circular, no such colour discrepancy can be seen.\n\nFurther, we also noticed that the viral circular shows certain alphabets/ numbers written in an unofficial manner. For instance, in \u20182019-2020,\u2019 the numbers are placed slightly higher as compared to the alignment of the remaining text. Similar format can be seen in point number two wherein the word \u201cresults\u201d is written in a dubious manner.\n\nWe also reached out to Rama Sharma, CBSE PRO, who confirmed to us that the circular in question is fake. \u201cThis is a fake circular. We haven\u2019t announced the official date of the CBSE results yet,\u201d she told The Quint. The Quint accessed the official CBSE statement on the fake circular which reads: \u201cIt has come to the notice of the Board that there is a fake message being circulated with regard to the declaration of class X and X11 Board Result 2020. It is hereby clarified that the Board has not yet announced the result dates.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
