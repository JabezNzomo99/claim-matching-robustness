This is false; autopsies confirmed Floyd\u2019s death, and personnel files of the officers involved are available online.\n\n\u201cI believe this was all staged. I don't believe George Floyd is dead,\u201d one post says. Similar claims can be found here and here.\n\nAnother Facebook post says: \u201cI think there is at the very least the \u2018possibility\u2019, that this was a filmed public execution of a black man by a white cop, with the purpose of creating racial tensions.\u201d\n\nFloyd, a 46-year-old, died on May 25, 2020 after white Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The incident was caught on camera by bystanders, and has sparked outrage across the country.\n\nBut plates with the word do exist in Minneapolis, and can be seen in a photo posted on the Minneapolis Police Department\u2019s Facebook page here.\n\nVarious Facebook users -- in several posts and a video -- have claimed that Floyd was seen at his own funeral. The man pictured is actually Stephen Jackson, a former NBA player.\n\nThe original photo, found with a reverse image search, was taken during a rally for Floyd and was posted on the NBA\u2019s official website on May 29, identifying Jackson, as well as other basketball players, in the caption.\n\n\u201cOne of our good friends, Stephen Jackson, who's a former NBA player, it just so happens that George was a friend of his, he used to call him twin, cause they look so much alike and, talking to Stephen, he said, \u2018Man, it could have been me,\u2019\u201d actor Jamie Foxx, who attended the rally with Jackson, said in a video posted on his official YouTube account on June, 4.\n\nHouston said farewell to Floyd in a rousing hometown funeral on June 9 with tributes and calls for justice for the 46-year-old African American. Some 500 guests were at the funeral, including Jackson.", "lang": "en"}
