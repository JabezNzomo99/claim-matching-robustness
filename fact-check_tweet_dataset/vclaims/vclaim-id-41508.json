As such, all news articles originating from the site are \u2018presumably fake news\u2019 and should not be believed or reposted!\n\nPresident Akufo-Addo has said he will pay for the construction of the proposed Parliamentary Chamber from his own pocket. This is according to an article by a Newsmunews.com.\n\nThe President is reported to have said, \u201cYes! I will sponsor it all. We will not use the tax payers money.\u201d\n\nThis comes on the back of widespread condemnation from a section of the public, particularly Twitter users, following information that Parliament intends to build a 450-capacity chamber which is likely to cost the Ghanaian taxpayer $200m.\n\nDUBAWA did a quick check of the website\u2019s \u2018About Us\u2019 section and found this disclaimer:\n\nIt is very obvious then that the information is false and must not be relied on by the public.\n\nMembers of the public are urged to be cautious of their source of information.\n\nCaroline Anipah is the Programme Officer of DUBAWA, Ghana.
