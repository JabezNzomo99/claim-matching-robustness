Let\u2019s check the authenticity of that claim.\n\nClaim: Congress leader Kapil Sibal has said that if the Ram Mandir is constructed, he would commit suicide. Fact: Kapil Sibal hasn\u2019t made any such statement. Information from no credible source was found which confirm that such comments were made by him. After the Supreme court\u2019s verdict in Ayodhya Ram Mandir issue, Kapil Sibal said that he welcomes the verdict by the court. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched on Google with keywords \u2018Kapil Sibal said that if Ram Mandir is constructed, he would commit suicide\u2019, no relevant information was obtained in the search results. If Kapil Sibal had really made such a statement, all the major newspapers and channels in India would have reported the statement. But no news agency has reported about Kapil Sibal making that statement. After the Supreme Court verdict in Ayodhya Ram Mandir issue in November 2019, posts claiming that Kapil Sibal has made a similar statement (\u2018I will not let Ram Mandir built till I am alive\u2019) went viral. FACTLY had debunked that claim and written a fact-check which can be read here.\n\nAlso, after the Supreme court\u2019s verdict in the Ayodhya Ram Mandir issue, Kapil Sibal, speaking to the media has said that he welcomes the verdict by the court. Before the verdict was given, Kapil Sibal has said \u2018Ram mandir will be built only when God wishes. It will not be built at the behest of Modi ji. The matter is in court\u2019. Those statements of Kapil Sibal can be seen here and here.\n\nTo sum it up, Congress leader Kapil Sibal hasn\u2019t said that if Ram Mandir is constructed, he would commit suicide.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
