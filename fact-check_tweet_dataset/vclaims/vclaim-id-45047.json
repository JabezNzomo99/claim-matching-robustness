Nineteen unarmed white people,\" Elder said June 2 on Fox News host Sean Hannity\u2019s TV show.\n\nA reader asked us about Elder\u2019s numbers, which he repeated on Twitter, so we decided to put them to the Truth-O-Meter.\n\nWe found that Elder was speaking broadly about police killings but pulling his numbers from the Washington Post\u2019s more narrow tally of fatal shootings by police officers in the line of duty.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s tally doesn\u2019t account for off-duty police or the use by on-duty officers of other force that can be lethal, such as tasers or physical restraint.\n\nThat means the number of unarmed people killed in encounters with law enforcement in 2019 is higher for both races than Elder claimed. How much higher is not clear.\n\nWhat is clear, experts told us, is that despite what Elder\u2019s absolute numbers may suggest, black people in the U.S. have died from fatal encounters with police at a disproportionate rate.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FBI keep tabs on deaths resulting from interactions with police, but both sources provide incomplete data that takes years to record.\n\nMore reliable data comes from the Washington Post and projects such as Mapping Police Violence and Fatal Encounters.\n\nIn emails to PolitiFact, Elder cited a tweet and a Wall Street Journal op-ed that pulled numbers from the Washington Post\u2019s database.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post data through June 3, police in the line of duty fatally shot 10 unarmed black people and 20 unarmed white people in 2019. (The data is updated as new facts emerge, and by June 5 the numbers jumped to 15 unarmed blacks and 25 unarmed whites.)\n\nBut Elder incorrectly claimed that his statistics represented the numbers of all black and white Americans who were killed by police, not the number of \"shootings in which a police officer, in the line of duty, shoots and kills a civilian,\" as the Washington Post describes its data.\n\nThe Washington Post doesn\u2019t account for deaths like Floyd\u2019s, for example. Floyd died in police custody May 25 after an officer in Minneapolis kneeled on his neck.\n\nWhen we asked about this incongruity, Elder told us that the majority of police killings involve firearms, \"so the number is not likely much bigger.\"\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say how much bigger it is.\n\nAs of June 3, Mapping Police Violence had counted 28 unarmed blacks and 51 unarmed whites who died at the hands of police in 2019.\n\nThose numbers are higher than the Washington Post\u2019s in part because Mapping Police Violence tracks police killings more broadly and includes officers who are off duty.\n\nIn 2019, among those who were unarmed when they encountered police, there were five black people and 12 white people who died from tasers, beatings or other uses of force by police, according to Mapping Police Violence\u2019s data. Off-duty officers killed four unarmed blacks and five unarmed whites. Those deaths won\u2019t show up in the Washington Post data.\n\nAnother reason Mapping Police Violence counted more unarmed people killed by police is that it considered victims in possession of toy guns, BB guns, airsoft guns or rocks to be unarmed. The Washington Post\u2019s database doesn\u2019t include those people in its unarmed tallies.\n\nIn 2019, at least eight black people and 16 white people were killed by police while in possession of a toy weapon or something similar, according to Mapping Police Violence.\n\nThere are also numerous 2019 cases, in both data sets, where the victim\u2019s armed status remains unknown or the victim was considered armed with a vehicle.\n\nOverall, the data on whether police-killing victims were armed or unarmed is \"messy,\" said Frank Edwards, an assistant professor at Rutgers University\u2019s School of Criminal Justice who co-authored a study on police killings.\n\nBecause groups that track the data often cite news reports that rely only on the word of police to establish whether a person was armed or unarmed, \"the data likely over-report the armed status of victims and the danger faced by police,\" Edwards said.\n\n\"Police have been known to misrepresent the danger presented by suspects,\" he said.\n\nThe data we have is also limited to deaths, said Lorie Fridell, professor of criminology at the University of South Florida. Ideally, she said, we would be able track police use of force more broadly, including force that could be deadly but doesn\u2019t turn out to be fatal.\n\nElder\u2019s claim also ignores the fact that the same Washington Post data shows black people are disproportionately shot and killed by police, experts said.\n\n\"There may be more unarmed whites than unarmed blacks killed each year, but the rate of shooting unarmed blacks is much larger,\" Fridell said, citing a report from the Washington Post that summarized years of findings from its database.\n\nBlack Americans represent 13% of the U.S. population, the report said, but they accounted for about a quarter of police shooting victims over four and a half years of data collection.\n\n\"They're over-represented in the data,\" said Brian Burghart, the founder of Fatal Encounters.\n\nElder said: \"Last year, there were nine unarmed black people killed (by law enforcement). Nineteen unarmed white people.\"\n\nThose numbers matched the Washington Post\u2019s tally of fatal shootings by police in the line of duty, although the Washington Post\u2019s figures have increased since Elder made his claim.\n\nBut not all police killings happen when officers are on duty, and not all involve a gunshot. The Washington Post\u2019s data doesn\u2019t include deaths like Floyd\u2019s, for example.\n\nElder\u2019s claim also omitted important context: that black people in the U.S. are disproportionately killed by police relative to their share of the population.\n\nOverall, Elder\u2019s statement contained elements of truth, but it left out important context that would give a different impression.\n\nWe rate it Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
