The claim is false; the videos have circulated online in reports about unrelated events, including a domestic violence incident in the US and cases of animal abuse in Honduras and Malaysia.\n\nThe videos were published here on Facebook on May 11, 2020. The post has since been shared more than 8,600 times.\n\nThe post features video collages of multiple videos and photos that show; a group of people beating a person lying on a bed; a crying woman with a bruised face and a kitten being violently trampled on.\n\nThe post\u2019s Burmese-language caption translates to English as: \u201cYou reap what you sow\u201d.\n\nThe same videos were published here on Facebook with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the videos and photos all show separate incidents.\n\nA reverse image search of keyframes extracted from the video found this live video published on the Facebook page of Ecuador-based artist Texon-Msc on May 9, 2020.\n\nTitled: \u201c#noalmaltratoanimal / The cruelty of people has no limits RIP .....

For this reason, the urban muralist \u2018Texon\u2019 carried out a work with the face of the little cat with the legend \u2018No al maltraro animal\u2019.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of keyframes from the video in the misleading post (L) and the video in the El Heraldo de Mexico report (R):\n\nA reverse image search on Google of keyframes extracted from the video showing a bruised woman found a longer version of the footage published here on YouTube on January 19, 2017.\n\nThe video, published by the US television channel KTNV Channel 13 Las Vegas, is titled \u201cStandoff suspect faces sex trafficking, attempted murder charges\u201d. The description reads: \u201cHis ex-girlfriend, Angela, says he beat her so badly she feared she was going to die.\u201d\n\nA keyword search found this report on the KTNV website, which states in part: \u201cBeaten and left for dead.
