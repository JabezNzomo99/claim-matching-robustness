This claim is false.\n\nThe claim (here) comes as several British news outlets reported London tube lines were busy following Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s announcement on Sunday May 10 that some people should return to work (here) .\n\nThe image shared in the Facebook post is a collage of four photographs, each showing commuters seemingly not adhering to social distancing on the London Underground and on train platforms.\n\nThe image was uploaded to Facebook on May 12 with the caption: \u201cLondon trains today god bless the English people\u201d.\n\nThis is false. Although the photos do show commuters in the capital, they were taken months or years before the given date.\n\nThe photo on the top left of the collage shows passengers waiting at London Waterloo Station. It was first published by local newspaper Surrey Live on May 14, 2019 in an article about train delays at London Waterloo.\n\nIn the article, the photo is credited to \u201cTom Smurthwaite / SurreyLive\u201d and has a caption that confirms it shows \u201cpassengers at London Waterloo station on Tuesday (May 14)\u201d (here) .\n\nOn the bottom left of the collage, there is a photograph of crowds walking down a London Underground platform. A reverse image search reveals this is a stock image that is consistently credited to SWNS media agency. It appears in articles, typically about air pollution on the Underground, such as this one from January 2, 2020 (here) .\n\nThe photo on the bottom right shows passengers standing on an underground platform. As noted on the Getty Image website, this was taken by photojournalist Oli Scarff on April 29, 2014, not May 12, 2020. (here)\n\nThe fourth photo, on the top right of the collage, shows passengers waiting on a train platform. The photo has been published in several articles stating it was taken on March 24, 2020 and in London.\n\nThe articles, in which the photo is credited to \u201cabb_igotadream/Triangle News\u201d, highlight the issue of overcrowding on public transport after the UK was put into lockdown on March 23 (here ) (here).\n\nFalse: The photographs were not taken on May 12, 2020, but several months or years previously.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
