In 2011, she was shot while meeting with constituents in Tucson. The shooter killed six people and wounded 13 others.\n\nGiffords PAC describes itself as backing elected officials and candidates \"who step up to fight the gun violence epidemic.\" Two weeks before releasing the Ryan ad, the PAC launched a campaign that included Ryan as one of six lawmakers on a #VoteThemOut list.\n\nTwo Democrats are running for the southern Wisconsin seat held by Ryan, who hasn\u2019t yet announced whether he will run for re-election in November 2018.\n\nTo back its attack on Ryan, Giffords PAC cited a dozen pieces of gun legislation that were pending since Ryan became speaker. Here are five, each of which was referred to a House committee, but was not voted out of that committee for a vote by the full House:\n\nGiffords PAC argues that the bills were blocked by Ryan by virtue of the fact that the main power of the House speaker -- as explained by a Washington Post primer on House leadership -- \"derives from his or her ability to determine what bills come to the floor for debate and a vote.\"\n\nBut the PAC provided no evidence that Ryan actually took steps to block the bills. And bills can be blocked by other lawmakers, such as committee chairs.\n\nNow to whether there are gun measures that Ryan has not blocked.\n\nTo refute the attack, Ryan\u2019s campaign organization cited three measures that passed the House:\n\nThe first two bills make no reference to guns, even if the school measure is aimed at fighting gun violence.\n\nThe other bill, however, did strengthen background checks, even if it it would also permit additional transportation of guns across state lines.\n\nRyan\u2019s campaign also argued that Ryan has not stood in the way of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives from banning bump stocks -- which accelerate a gun\u2019s firing speed -- with regulations using existing law.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear that ATF could do so without new legislation; indeed, the Justice Department has said it does not have the legal authority under current law to do so. And Ryan has indicated that the House would not take up a bill that would explicitly allow a ban.\n\nGiffords PAC says: \"Paul Ryan has blocked all action to strengthen our gun laws.\"\n\nThe anti-gun violence political action committee cited a dozen gun-control measures that didn\u2019t get to a vote in the House. So, it\u2019s clear that Ryan did not move to bring those measures to the floor. But that\u2019s not the same as Ryan himself blocking the measures, given that other lawmakers, such as committee chairs, also have such power.\n\nAlso, a bill that would strengthen background checks did pass the House -- although it also expanded gun rights, by making it legal for licensed concealed carry holders to bring guns across state lines.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
