This is incorrect.", "author": "theferret.scot", "date": "2019-12-03GMT13:30:27+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-28138", "url": "https://theferret.scot/nicola-sturgeon-violent-crime-fact-check/", "vclaim": "Nicola Sturgeon has appeared regularly across the British media as her party outlines its vision for Scotland before the general election.\n\nShe answered questions from listeners to Radio 5 Live on Monday 2 December, who covered topics including Brexit, Scottish independence and the SNP\u2019s domestic record in Scotland.\n\nThe First Minister made a specific claim about her government\u2019s record in reducing crime in recent years.\n\nFerret Fact Service looked at this claim and found it False.\n\nAfter host Nicky Campbell read out a series of statistics about Scotland\u2019s murder rate, prompting the First Minister to mount a defence of the Scottish Government, stating that violent crime was now at a \u201c40-year plus\u201d low.\n\nRecorded crime statistics are published each year by the Scottish Government. This refers to crimes which are reported and recorded by police and does not equate to convictions, nor does it include all crimes committed as not all crime is reported.\n\nThe statistics separate out different types of crime with non-sexual crimes of violence and sexual crimes in two distinct categories.\n\nThe most recent statistics for 2018-19 showed 8,008 non-sexual crimes of violence, which is at its highest level since 2011-12, when 9,484 such crimes were recorded.\n\nRecorded non-sexual violent crime has increased year-on-year since 2014-15. The 6,272 crimes recorded that year was the lowest number since 1974.\n\nSturgeon\u2019s suggestion that Scotland\u2019s violent crime was currently at a 40-year low is out of date.\n\nThe Scottish Government also publishes statistics showing violent crime rates per 10,000 population. These show Scotland currently at 15 violent crimes per 10,000 people, the highest rate since 2012-13\n\nOver the course of the SNP\u2019s time in charge of the Scottish Government, violent crime rates have reduced, but the evidence shows that recorded crime has increased in Scotland over recent years.\n\nIn response to an evidence request from Ferret Fact Service, the Scottish Government provided figures showing a 43 per cent reduction in non-sexual violent crime, and that crime today was at a lower level than in 1974. However this does not equate to the current crime level being at a 40-year low.\n\nSturgeon also stated that \u201ccrime generally\u201d is at a 40-year plus low. Total crime has also increased in Scotland since 2016-17, and the current figure of 246,480 is the highest since 2014-15. Total crime per 10,000 population is at its highest point for three years.\n\nNicola Sturgeon\u2019s comments on Radio 5 Live were incorrect. While non-sexual violent crime reduced to a 40-year low in 2014-15, it has steadily increased since then. The crime rate by 10,000 population has also increased to its highest point since 2012-13.\n\nIn response to an evidence request from Ferret Fact Service, the Scottish Government said that non-sexual violent crime has fallen 43 per cent since 2006-07, and the most recent figures show lower rates than 40 years ago, citing recorded crime figures.\n\nFerret Fact Service (FFS) is a non-partisan fact checker, working to the International Fact-Checking Network fact-checkers\u2019 code of principles.
