The accompanying graph showed an increasing number of terrorists killed since 2012. The first thought that crosses the mind on seeing this graph is why is it showing a comparison only since 2012. Why not a longer period? Why not the full UPA term? Is there an attempt to \u2018window-dress\u2019 the data? Experience with data put out by BJP shows that it probably is, but let us give them the benefit of doubt and check it out.\n\nHere is the infographic tweeted by Malviya:\n\nThe same claim was also made in a Times of India article a few days earlier. \u201cAs counter-terror forces mount offensive against terrorists in Jammu & Kashmir, the gains are starting to show,\u201d claimed the article. An unnamed source also told Times of India, \u201cthe forces have been given a free hand to track and intercept terrorists holed up in the valley, before launching .intelligence-based operations with due mapping of the target and how to neuteralise terrorists with minimum collateral damage.\u201d There is a striking similarity in the argument made here and Malviya\u2019s subsequent tweet and infographic. Times of India shared a detailed infographic, using data only since 2012. Surely the team that put together this infographic had access to the complete \u2018satp\u2019 data. The same story was also carried by Times Now and Zee News claiming Indian Army\u2019s counter terror offensive yielding good results.\n\nThe data shared in the infographic is sourced from \u2018satp\u2019 which is the South Asia Terrorism Portal. We decided to check the original source to verify the claim.\n\nThe data presented in the infographic is accurate but as expected, the years have been carefully selected in favor of BJP. If we take a longer view to include UPA-II as well, the picture changes completely. Terrorist fatalities were much higher in 2009-10 period which has not been shown in the BJP graph.\n\nIf we cover the UPA-I term as well, the number of terrorists killed peaks in 2005 at 1000 and then declines in line with the decline in total deaths (including civilian and security forces) due to terrorist violence during UPA-II. The deaths in terrorism related violence picks up again in 2016.\n\nNumber of terrorists killed is only one part of the story. Let us also look at the number of security forces killed during this period.\n\nIt turns out that the year 2016 had the highest security forces fatalities since UPA-II. 2017 also doesn\u2019t look good as till July 16th, already 40 security forces have been killed which is higher than the full year fatalities in some of the previous years. There is not much evidence of the success claimed in the Times of India article due to \u201cseamless coordination between the Army, central forces, state government and intelligence agencies.\u201d\n\nThe number of civilian casualties in 2017 are also of concern. At 38, the number of civilian deaths till July 16th, 2017 has already crossed the full year figures for previous years since 2010.\n\nConcerns have been raised about BJP\u2019s handling of the Kashmir situation. It had earlier made claims of demonetization breaking the backbone of terrorism and now after recent attack on Amarnath Yatra, it is presenting incomplete data set to show success in countering terrorism. It is understandable if BJP attempts to project itself in a positive light but it is disturbing to find national media also doing the same. A narrative of \u201cfree-hand\u201d to the Army is being built. It is not clear what it means and how it is different from the past. The numbers however do not point to a roaring success that is being claimed in the infographics that have been circulated.", "lang": "en"}
