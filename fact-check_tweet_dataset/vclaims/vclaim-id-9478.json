The state is on track to spend more in this fiscal year \u2014 more than $17.9 billion \u2014 than at any time in state history.\"\n\nWhere does the state money go? Well, schools, both K-12 and higher education, account for one of the heftiest lines in the budget. Another big ticket item is SoonerCare, the state\u2019s Medicaid program.\n\nIt all adds up. We wondered if it\u2019s truly the case that the state is spending more money than ever before. The answer depends on whether you think inflation matters.\n\nMost economists, bankers and corporate CFOs do, and when you factor in that a dollar today is worth less than a dollar in the past, the council\u2019s claim falls short.\n\nThe council got its spending numbers through 2016 from the state\u2019s Office of Management and Enterprise Services. The state hasn\u2019t closed out the books for 2017, but preliminarily, expenditures hit about $17.9 billion. (Technically, we\u2019re now in FY 2018.) Based solely on the raw dollars, that part of the council\u2019s statement is on the mark. Here\u2019s how the official totals look in the years for which we have final numbers:\n\nBut the numbers change when you take inflation into account. We used a very common yardstick -- constant 2009 dollars based on the changes in the national Consumer Price Index.\n\nViewed that way, spending today amounts to about $15.83 billion in 2009 dollars. It was clearly higher at the height of the recession in 2009 ($16.08 billion) and 2010 ($16.35 billion), and a smidge more in 2011. This chart shows the constant (in red) and nominal or current dollars (in blue) side-by-side.\n\nSpokesman David Autry at the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs said the inflation adjustment had the biggest impact on the results, but he discounted its importance.\n\n\"Working Oklahomans (taxpayers) aren\u2019t allowed the luxury of adjusting for inflation when the mortgage or rent comes due,\" Autry said. \"The taxpayers who foot the bill for state government are forced every day to live within their means.\"\n\nAdjusting for inflation does have a place in the council\u2019s toolkit. Autry said that the council adjusts for inflation when it looks at numbers over a longer period of time, because \"because readers may not have that kind of knowledge.\"\n\nHe also noted that the results shift depending on the choice of an inflation measure, and sent us three alternatives. But even using his options, spending in 2010 topped 2016 for the two that looked at what consumers pay. Only by limiting the measure to what producers pay (the producer price index) did 2016 come out the highest.\n\nWe can round out the spending burden picture by looking at spending compared to the state\u2019s population and its economy. When there are fewer people, the burden falls on fewer shoulders. If the economy is smaller, even the same amount of spending would require a bigger economic effort.\n\nThe state gained about 330,000 people between 2006 and 2016. Its economy grew by about $33 billion in real terms in the same period, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\nBased on population, constant dollar spending was higher in seven of the past 11 years. Measured against the size of the state\u2019s economy, it was higher in eight out of the past 11 years.\n\nThe Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs said that spending this year is on track to be the highest ever. While the raw numbers show that, the statement ignores the impact of inflation, a standard practice when comparing dollars over time. Factoring in inflation shows that real spending was higher in 2009 to 2011.\n\nWhen population and economic growth are added in, spending has been higher over most of the past decade.\n\nThe statement contains an element of truth but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
