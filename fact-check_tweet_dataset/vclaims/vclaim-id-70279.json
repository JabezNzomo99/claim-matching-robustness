This article is false and the Russian embassy issued a denial.\n\n\u201cUrgent: Russia demands that France stop using CFA franc.\u201d The title of this article, published on February 10 by the website Africa24.info, is illustrated with a composite photo depicting Emmanuel Macron and Vladimir Putin face to face.\n\n\u201cRussia has given an ultimatum to France to end the monetary system it imposes on its ex-colonies in Africa or to face serious consequences. This announcement came after anti-CFA movements emerged and demonstrations were held in several countries to denounce the CFA franc as an instrument of alienation,\u201d reads the article, which has been shared more than 90,000 times, according to audience monitoring platform Crowdtangle.\n\n\u201cOur sources pointed out that the Russians do not consider this currency a good thing for Africa because it is an obstacle to development. Our sources also reported that the Russian Minister of Economy gave his French counterpart a 6-month ultimatum to put an end to this currency so that the African countries concerned could develop. If not, there will be Russian economic sanctions and a ban on imports of French products,\u201d added Africa24.info.\n\nSince February, the article has reappeared in various guises in dozens of online media based across west Africa. The Mauritanian news site Kassataya, for example, picked up the story on March 13 to report the apparent Russian ultimatum to France as a \u201ccrushing blow.\u201d\n\nThe Africa24.info website -- not to be confused with the international television news network Africa24 -- was also behind a false story claiming France was delivering arms to Boko Haram which we disproved in a previous fact check.\n\nThe Russian ministry for foreign affairs published a statement on its website denying the ultimatum story.\n\n\u201cOur readers will be highly amused at the fact that Africa24.info is based in California, rather a long way from Africa. It would appear the United States is the most appropriate place to receive the most trustworthy information on Russian foreign policy in Europe and in Africa,\u201d the statement read sardonically. \u201cWe must stress the disgusting and absurd nature of the article published by Africa24.info,\u201d it concluded.", "lang": "en"}
