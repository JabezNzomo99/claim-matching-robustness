No, not at all,\u201d said Atlantic Council senior fellow Anders Aslund, who added that there are \u201cmany complaints.\u201d\n\nBelarus, he said, has complained that Russian authorities are blocking its food exports to Russia.\n\n\u201cDecisions in the EAEU commission are made solely by the Russian government,\u201d Aslund said. \u201cRussia has re-imposed a border zone and border controls recently. Belarus complains about not enjoying the Russian domestic prices of oil and gas.\u201d\n\nAndrei Yahorau, a Belarussian scholar and director of the Center for European Transformation, said the Eurasian Economic Union treaty itself is \u201cnot transparent,\u201d which makes it \u201cdifficult to give a more exact assessment.\u201d\n\nRussia, he said, is not upholding its treaty obligations, at least \u201cfrom the Belarusian government point of view.\u201d\n\nSwedish analyst Andres Ostlund told Polygraph.info that \u201cRussia has initiated the EAEU as a tool for control and domination over the \u2018near abroad\u2019\u201d -- meaning the countries neighboring Russia that were once part of the Soviet Union.\n\n\u201cRussia will bend the rules in the EAEU whenever it suits Russia\u2019s interests,\u201d Ostlund said. \u201cNow Russia has its brawl with Belarus and then the EAEU comes to play for Russia to get Belarus back in line.\u201d\n\nThe Eurasian Economic Union treaty, signed between Russia and Belarus in 2014, has expanded to include two Central Asian nations, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, along with Armenia.\n\nRussia hopes to expand the EAEU by offering membership to such countries as India and Brazil. President Vladimir Putin reportedly sees the project as potentially bringing former Soviet states back together, as well as further spreading Russia\u2019s influence and creating a bloc similar to the European Union but led by Moscow.\n\nAlong with economic cooperation, the treaty also promises an open-borders policy, including visa waivers for all the member-states.\n\nHowever, some observers noted from the start of the EAEU that the union, as one of them put it, fell short of \u201cPutin\u2019s lofty vision.\u201d\n\nThe EAEU\u2019s future became particularly uncertain after Russia annexed Crimea and Western nations imposed economic sanctions on Moscow for its actions in Ukraine \u00ad\u2013 the country Vladimir Putin reportedly viewed as the jewel in the economic union\u2019s crown.", "lang": "en"}
