While it\u2019s true that Kaepernick has made an agreement with Disney and ESPN Films to create a documentary series focusing on race, that doesn\u2019t mean he has been \u201chired\u201d by Disney to \u201cteach children\u201d about American history.\n\nOn July 6, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback and Disney announced a first-look deal for a documentary series \u2014 to be produced by ESPN Films \u2014 about Kaepernick\u2019s experience, according to a press release from ESPN.\n\n\u201cColin\u2019s experience gives him a unique perspective on the intersection of sports, culture and race, which will undoubtedly create compelling stories that will educate, enlighten and entertain, and we look forward to working with him on this important collaboration,\u201d Disney executive chairman Bob Iger said in the statement.\n\nPer the press release, the \u201cfirst project in development as part of this deal is an exclusive docuseries chronicling Kaepernick\u2019s journey. Using extensive new interviews and a vast never-before-seen archive that documents his last five years, Kaepernick will tell his story from his perspective.\u201d\n\nOverall, the partnership \u201cwill focus on telling scripted and unscripted stories that explore race, social injustice and the quest for equity, and will provide a new platform to showcase the work of Black and Brown directors and producers.\u201d\n\nKaepernick has been a lightning rod in popular culture since 2016, when he began protesting systematic racism and police violence against Black Americans by kneeling during the national anthem before NFL games.\n\nHis protest was mimicked by other players, but it also became a recurring talking point among media pundits, some of whom accused him of disrespecting national symbols. This narrative has been echoed by the White House.\n\nThe issue Kaepernick raised with his protest has hardly gone away. In the spring of 2020, racial justice protests swept the country after a video went viral of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, a Black man, for almost nine minutes. Floyd died in police custody.\n\nThe public outcry coupled with massive protests prompted a national conversation about racism and compelled many businesses \u2014 including entertainment companies \u2014 to reckon with their own failures when it comes to racial equality.", "lang": "en"}
