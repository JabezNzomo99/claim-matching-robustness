Gandhi\u2019s tweet was retweeted by a Twitter account \u201cPakistan Defence\u201d and the language used by Giriraj Singh in his tweet attempted to imply that the Congress President is supported by Pakistan\u2019s Defence wing. His tweet was liked over 1,500 times and retweeted 810 times at the time of writing this article.\n\nAnurag Dixit also made the identical claim, with his tweet drawing over 1,000 retweets. Dixit is followed by top leaders of the BJP, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nSeveral others who are followed by the office of Railway Minister Piyush Goyal also circulated that the Pakistani Defense wing retweeted Rahul Gandhi\u2019s tweet.\n\nThe retweet was by an online forum that discusses Pakistani defence issues\n\nWithin hours of the aforestated tweets, it waspointed out that the account which retweeted Rahul Gandhi\u2019s tweet wasn\u2019t the official handle of the Defense Ministry of Pakistan. However, none of those who made the claim took down their tweets.\n\nThere are several clues that indicated that the Twitter account \u201cPakistan Defence\u201d (@defencedotpk), which retweeted Rahul Gandhi, has nothing to do with Pakistan\u2019s Defence Wing:\n\u2022 It does not have a blue tick which verifies the authenticity of a Twitter handle.\n\u2022 The bio reads \u2013 \u201cHit our website for free membership\u201d. A country\u2019s defence wing can never offer \u201cfree membership\u201d to civilians.\n\u2022 The bio also includes a website \u2013 \u201cdefence.pk/pdf/\u201d. This website lists @defencedotpk as its official Twitter handle. However, defence.pk is not the official website of Pakistan\u2019s Ministry of Defence and was started as a forum to discuss issues pertaining to the Pakistani army. Any Pakistani government website ends with \u201cgov.pk\u201d and the URL of the official website of the defence ministry is mod.gov.pk.\n\u2022 Ministry of Defence, Pakistan does not have an official Twitter handle.\n\nNumerous unofficial/parody accounts are active on social media and it is common to fall for them. Alt News had earlier reported how parody accounts of several news organisations fooled individuals on the internet. In June this year, a parody account of Warren Buffet escaped the noticed of The Economic Timeswhich published one of its tweets on the daily. Several social media users had also fallen for a parody handle dedicated to Tripura CM Biplab Deb.\n\nHowever, a cabinet minister posting the screenshot of a retweet by the Twitter handle of an online forum to imply that Rahul Gandhi is \u201cfighting for Pakistan in India\u201d cannot be ignored as a mere slight. Despite several social media users pointing out the falseness of the retweet, Giriraj Singh and others are yet to take down their tweets and issue a clarification.", "lang": "en"}
