Really?", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-05-01T18:41:59Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-85919", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/03/13/the-democrats-claim-that-the-gop-underperformed-on-its-way-to-victory/", "vclaim": "It was a theme even picked up by the White House press secretary. \u201cIt\u2019s a race that had a lot of peculiarities to it,\u201d Jay Carney said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a special, as any special does, it\u2019s a race where, again, Republicans held the seat for 58 years, where they routinely won that seat by 30 or more points, and last night they won by less than two points.\u201d\n\nBut how of much a true picture do these results show? For years, Democrats\u2014and analysts\u2013had said that once Young leaves office, it would flip to the other party. That\u2019s because in races when Young was not on the ballot, Democrats consistently were winners.\n\nIn the same district, President Obama, for instance, beat both Mitt Romney in 2012 and John McCain in 2008. Alex Sink, when she unsuccessfully sought the governorship in 2010, won the congressional district even while losing the state. Sink also won the district when she was elected Florida\u2019s chief financial officer in 2006.\n\nThe Cook Political Report\u2019s Partisan Voting Index identifies the district as one of the more competitive districts in the nation\u2014Republican plus 1 percent. (The PVI is based on how the district presidential vote compares to the overall national race.) Florida\u2019s 13th congressional district ranked 230 on a list of 435 districts, with 1 being the most Republican and 435 the most Democratic.\n\nIn response, officials at the DNC and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee pointed to polls showing turnout would tilt between 8 and 13 percentage points toward Republicans, even as they also showed a tight race between Jolly and Sink. \u201cThe hill is steeper in the a special election than a general election,\u201d said Emily Bittner of the DCCC. \u201cWe went from R+13 to losing by two points,\u201d which she said put the Democrats in a good position to win outright in the general election in November.\n\nCharlie Cook, the editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, noted that Sink was an experienced candidate who previously had run for governor, while Jolly is lobbyist who was a political novice. \u201cThe expectation was that it would be close but that she should win,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that Republicans underperformed in a district that Obama carried twice is laughable.\u201d He added that it is \u201cextremely rare\u201d for someone to win special election and then lose the general election just a few months later.\n\nWe know everyone has a job to do, but this is taking political spin to a ridiculous level. Yes, Young was a repeat winner, but he was a beloved incumbent. Democrats could write this off as a special election with no real ramifications nationwide, they could blame the failure to win on harsh attacks by outside groups and they could say it was a tough loss. But they cannot credibly say that the other party \u201cunderperformed\u201d on its way to victory.", "lang": "en"}
