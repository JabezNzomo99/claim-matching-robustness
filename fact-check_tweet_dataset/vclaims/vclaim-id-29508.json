(In case you missed it, we fact-checked a number of false and misleading claims made by the candidates on both the first and second night.)\n\nBut popular social media posts have used erroneous statistics to falsely describe the debate.\n\n\u201cDNC Debate: \u2018Trump\u2019 was said 1,326 times, \u2018Free\u2019 was said 683 times, Spanish was spoken 14 times, and \u2018America\u2019 was said twice,\u201d the posts read.\n\nThe posts don\u2019t specify whether that\u2019s a reference to the first or second night of the nearly four-hour, two-part debate, which was hosted by NBC News, MSNBC and Telemundo. The numbers are far off, either way.\n\nWe searched the NBC News transcripts of both debates and found that, including moderator questions: \u201cTrump\u201d was mentioned 64 times; the word \u201cfree\u201d was uttered 17 times; and \u201cAmerica\u201d was said 85 times (including four references to \u201cCentral America\u201d or \u201cLatin America,\u201d but not including the more than 100 references to \u201cAmerican\u201d or \u201cAmericans\u201d).\n\nAs for the claim that \u201cSpanish was spoken 14 times,\u201d we identified 11 instances of a candidate or moderator speaking Spanish or using a Spanish word within their remarks during the two nights.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
