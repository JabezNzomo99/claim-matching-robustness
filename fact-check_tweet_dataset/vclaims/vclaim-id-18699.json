Any politician throwing around specific estimates like this should at least provide source materials. Pence is the only official we\u2019ve seen using this $900,000-per-household figure. None of the experts we consulted could make sense of it. President Trump has not made the same claim.\n\nThe American Action Forum, which describes itself as a center-right think tank, analyzed the Green New Deal proposal and estimated that it would cost from $50 trillion to $93 trillion. This study often is characterized by Republicans as saying that the Green New Deal would cost $93 trillion, but the authors are more circumspect. They stress that they came up with a range of estimates, not one hard number, and their analysis includes several caveats.\n\nThe sheer scope of these proposals would presumably reduce or eliminate existing federal spending in certain areas, perhaps beyond what we have estimated here. Obviously, this leaves room to improve on the estimated impacts. ... Similarly, the GND promises to ensure that every person has a guaranteed job, a family-sustaining rate of pay, and benefits such as paid leave and paid vacations. If everyone has good pay with good benefits, why is it simultaneously necessary to provide targeted programs for food, housing, and health care? Some of these objectives appear to be redundant. Nevertheless, we incorporate them into our analysis in an effort to reflect the GND\u2019s intent.\n\nNoah Kaufman, a research scholar at Columbia University\u2019s SIPA Center on Global Energy Policy, dismissed the study. \u201cThe Green New Deal, as I understand it, is a set of principles or objectives, not policy proposals,\u201d Kaufman said. \u201cAchieving a goal like decarbonization can be cheap or expensive, depending on the policies chosen to get there. So I don\u2019t put any credence on a study that assigns a set of expensive policies to an objective and then says achieving the objective is expensive. They are assuming the answer to the question.\u201d\n\nWhat happens when removing the assumption that the Green New Deal would replace air travel with high-speed rail? \u201cIt would change the transportation number; there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it would change the spirit of the analysis.\u201d He noted that his study \u201cmissed free college,\u201d and he added, \u201cWhat does it mean to retrofit every building in America? \u2026 That could be incredibly costly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey assume that most new capacity will come from nuclear, which we know from the latest, state-of-the-art Lazard energy cost analysis is the most expensive zero-carbon power source one can build at utility scale,\u201d the Markey aide wrote in an email. \u201cEven without subsidies already on the books, wind power is cost-competitive with existing coal and nuclear plants in operation. Cost of solar and wind are coming down (by 88% and 69% respectively since 2009) and cost of nuclear has gone up (+23%).\u201d\n\nNow let\u2019s drill down on Pence\u2019s claim. Alyssa Farah, his spokeswoman, did not respond to our questions. But the White House has not produced any estimates of the costs associated with the Green New Deal or Medicare-for-all. So the best assumption is that the vice president was relying on independent analyses such as those from the American Action Forum and the Mercatus Center or the Urban Institute.\n\n\u201cAAF acknowledges it is merely \u2018estimating the order of magnitude\u2019 of the cost,\u201d said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. \u201cAnd the range of its estimates is quite high. It is most extreme with the guaranteed-jobs piece, where the range is from $49,000 to $322,000 [per household]. This is not surprising, since it is not possible to model a proposal as vague as guaranteeing a well-paying job to every American.", "lang": "en"}
