We had a trade deficit with the EU of around \u00a380 billion in the same time period.\n\nThe UK had a trade surplus with the USA of around \u00a334 billion in the year to June 2017, so we export more to them than we import. In terms of services, the UK had a surplus of over \u00a323 billion, and in terms of goods we had a surplus of over \u00a310 billion in that time.\n\nThe USA accounted for 18% of UK exports in that period, and 11% of our imports came from the USA.\n\nThe UK ran a trade deficit with the EU of around \u00a380 billion in year to June 2017, so we export less than we import. In 2015, the trade deficit was about \u00a366 billion\u2014which might be what the audience member was referring to.\n\nThis is primarily driven by goods\u2014the UK had a trade deficit of just under \u00a397 billion with the EU during that time. In terms of services, we had a surplus of \u00a317 billion.\n\nEU member states accounted for 43% of UK exports and 54% of imports. You can read more about the UK\u2019s trade with the EU here.\n\nAlthough they are produced by the government, we should not treat the numbers presented here as exact. This is because of something called \u201ctrade asymmetries\u201d.\n\nEach country records its imports and exports separately. Trade asymmetries occur when two partner countries record the same transaction as being of different values. So, say the UK sells the USA 500 bottles of whisky, the UK may record it as worth $50,000, whereas the USA records it as $49,000.\n\nThis can be for a variety of reasons including differences in the way values are converted, the timing of the transaction being recorded and methodological differences. Trade relations are complex\u2014using a range of changing technologies and with supply chains crossing multiple borders\u2014 so it\u2019s hard to measure these relations exactly.\n\nThese can lead to quite dramatic differences. In 2014 the UK recorded that it had a services trade surplus of $44.8 billion with the USA. However, the USA thinks that should be a deficit of $13.3 billion. That\u2019s a difference of $58.1 billion.\n\nAll countries have trade asymmetries, and the UK\u2019s are similar to other countries\u2019, according to an analysis by Eurostat.", "lang": "en"}
