The actor\u2019s representative has debunked it before.\n\nA number of similar pro-President Donald Trump Facebook pages, seemingly in concert, posted a meme this week that spreads a quote falsely attributed to the actor Kurt Russell.\n\nAmong the offenders: \u201cVirginia Supporters For President Donald J Trump,\u201d \u201cConnecticut Supporters For President Donald J Trump,\u201d \u201cPennsylvania Supporters For President Donald J Trump\u201d and \u201cNevada Supporters For President Donald J Trump.\u201d\n\nThose pages published the meme in quick succession, all posting between 1:32 a.m. and 1:59 a.m. on Dec. 4.\n\nCollectively, the meme accrued thousands of shares \u2014 positioning the star actor as a devout and outspoken supporter of the president \u2014 even though Russell never made the alleged statement, previously debunked by PolitiFact and the Associated Press.\n\nA representative for Russell told the Associated Press last month that Russell did not say it.\n\n\u201cPresident Donald J. Trump is relentless. I\u2019ve never seen a man so dedicated & determined,\u201d the quote reads. \u201cI\u2019d like to think I would be as courageous as he is, but I just don\u2019t know. The world is after him & he stands there in the face of pure evil, rock solid & ready to fight for us. God bless this brave man.\u201d\n\nThe meme, complete with a black-and-white headshot of a younger Russell, includes \u201c#VoteRedToSaveAmerica.\u201d\n\nThe quote and photo were shared in a popular Facebook post last month, which sourced it to a pro-Trump Twitter user who uses a photo of Russell as the profile picture.\n\nBogus celebrity quotes and rumors have remained fixtures in the landscape of political falsehoods. And it\u2019s not the first time Russell was targeted.\n\nIn 2016, a doctored photo was made to look as if Russell and partner Goldie Hawn were sporting pro-Trump T-shirts, as Snopes reported at the time. In reality, Hawn publicly declared her support for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nRussell, who identifies as a libertarian, said in a 2015 interview that he prefers not to use his platform to talk about politics.\n\n\u201cI have my political point of view, of course; I\u2019m an American and I\u2019m entitled to it,\u201d he told the Daily Beast. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like espousing it publicly.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nClinch, Matt and Tania Bryer. \u201cGoldie Hawn on Hillary Clinton and not being married to Kurt Russell for 33 years.\u201d CNBC. 28 Sep 2016.\n\nStern, Marlow. \u201cKurt Russell Talks Cowboys, Guns, and Life as Hollywood\u2019s Most \u2018Hardcore\u2019 Libertarian.\u201d The Daily Beast. 22 Dec 2015.", "lang": "en"}
