No, that's not true: The claim is part of a conspiracy theory that \"globalists\" are planning a takeover of America as part of the \"Deep State\" war against President Trump. It purportedly would begin in Virginia with a marshal-law declaration and a massive confiscation of guns. But the job posting used as evidence that the United Nations is recruiting troops for the U.S. mission is actually a posting for a managerial job working with existing peacekeeping missions, which are mostly in Africa, a UN spokesperson told Lead Stories.\n\nThose claiming it is about the United States overlook that President Trump has a veto over all UN missions. Also, the posting is not for \"paramilitary troops,\" but for an administrative position.\n\nThe claim originated from an article published by NationalFile.com on December 31, 2019, titled \"New York UN Office Recruits Paramilitary Troops for 'Disarmament' and 'Reintegration' of US Civilians\" (archived here), which opened:\n\nThe job requires experience \"in disarmament affairs, political analysis or in national military or paramilitary service\" The United Nations is now accepting job applications in New York City, New York for Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration officers to \"contribute to security and stability in post-conflict environments.\" The job listing was posted to the U.N. careers homepage on Dec. 26, and notes that \"female candidates are strongly encouraged to apply for this position\" because \"the United Nations Secretariat is committed to achieving 50/50 gender balance in its staff.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nA United Nations spokesperson confirmed in a statement to Lead Stories that the position is for an officer to work on the existing 14 UN peacekeeping missions, which do not include an invasion of the United States:\n\nThe job posting is for a specialist in Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration of former combatants. While the posting in New York where the UN is headquartered, the work takes place in some of the 14 UN Peacekeeping Missions. The UN does not operate any Peacekeeping or Political missions in the United States. As reference, UN Peacekeeping or Political missions have to be authorized by members of the Security Council. The United States is a permanent member of the Council with a right to veto any resolution.\n\nTo be clear, the United Nations could not initiate a disarmament - or gun confiscation - mission in the the United States without the approval of Trump, who has a veto over all UN resolutions. The governor of Virginia cannot invite UN troops into his state, as some perpetuating the conspiracy rumors claim.\n\nThe job title is listed as \"DISARMAMENT, DEMOBILIZATION AND REINTEGRATION OFFICER, P4\" in the UN's Department of Peacekeeping Operations in New York, which is where the United Nations is headquartered. The job's responsibilities include:\n\nWithin delegated authority, the Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Officer will be responsible for the following duties:\n\u2022 Acts as a Focal Point for Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) components for two to three missions, responsible for planning, support to implementation and evaluation;\n\u2022 Participates in DPO and Integrated Task Force planning meetings for the establishment of a new peacekeeping mission with a potential DDR component;\n\u2022 Provides technical assistance to peace negotiations;\n\u2022 Participates in technical assessment missions;\n\u2022 Advises, develops and reviews (as appropriate) initial DDR functional strategy and concept of operations for further development into a full programme by the DDR component and the National DDR Commission;\n\u2022 Drafts and reviews DDR inputs to SG report, code cables, and talking points;\n\u2022 Develops initial result-based framework and budget for new DDR components in new mission;\n\u2022 Liaises with UNDP and donor community to raise voluntary contributions for DDR programmes;\n\u2022 Presents and/or defends new and subsequent DDR budgetary requirements in the ACABQ and the 5th Committee of the General Assembly;\n\u2022 Develops staffing structure and terms of reference for a DDR component, including terms of integration with other UN agencies, funds and programmes;\n\u2022 Provides technical clearance for applicants to DDR units in new and ongoing missions;\n\u2022 Provides Headquarters support in planning the civilian and military logistics support for DDR;\n\u2022 Continually reviews DDR programme strategy and implementation through relevant documents, reports and code cables;\n\u2022 Conducts field missions to assess implementation of established DDR programmes;\n\u2022 Identifies potential problems and issues to be addressed and suggests remedies to DDR units in the field;\n\u2022 Liaises with Member States, UN actors and other DDR interested partners to represent the mission's DDR component at the Headquarters level;\n\u2022 Establishes and maintains an outreach network with CSOs and IGOs active in the area of DDR.\n\u2022 Supports the doctrine development work in the area of DDR in the department, with the Inter-Agency Working Group (IAWG) on DDR and other relevant national and international actors working on DDR issues;\n\u2022 Contributes to Department-level or Policy Committee-level policy development work on DDR and related issues;\n\u2022 Maintains and further develops the Integrated DDR Standards - a set of inter-agency policies, guidelines and procedures on DDR;\n\u2022 On behalf of the Chief of the DDR Section, co-chairs the IAWG on DDR, contributes to bringing coherence to the interaction of the UN system and its partners on DDR;\n\u2022 Supervises the Associate Expert (Junior Professional Officer) in the development and maintenance of the web-based United Nations DDR Resource Centre;\n\u2022 Liaises with others (UN, regional organisations and Member States) providing DDR.\n\nOther duties as required.\n\nAn indiction that these responsibilities would not include disarming U.S. citizens is the sentence that says experience in Africa is important:\n\nConspiracy theories about a United Nations takeover of the United States are not new, but Lead Stories has found a surge of such claims surrounding the impeachment of Trump and gun control proposals, particularly in Virginia.
