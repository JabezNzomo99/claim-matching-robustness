However, the video is of Italy's Republic Day in 2018 and not from France. Several social media users shared the viral video, with the claim, \"You\u2019ve seen the Rafael landing in India but see the farewell from France with Indian Tricolors.\" (sic) An archived version of the tweet can be found here.

We also received a query regarding the viral video on our WhatsApp helpline.\n\nThe video is from 2018 and shows Italy celebrating its Republic Day and not France's farewell to Rafale, as claimed. A reverse image search of the key-frames of the video led us to a report by EuroNews from 2 June 2018 which is celebrated as Italy's Republic Day. It shows the jets flying past the Monument of Victor Emanuel II, called the 'Vittoriano' or the 'Altara della Patria.' The colours of the smoke trails represent the Italian flag which is of green, white and red colours and not the Indian flag. Further, the flag seen in the viral video is also of Italy and not India. Images showing the jet formation similar to the one in the viral video were also shared by Italy's defence forces' twitter handle in 2019. The tweet stated: The 'Frecce Tricolori' fly over the Altara della Patria as a tribute to the soldiers by President Mattarella, the Minister of Defense and the Air Squadron General Enzo Vecciarelli. The 'Frecce Tricolori' is the aerobatic demonstration team of the Italian Air Force. As clearly seen in the viral video, their formation consists of nine jets, whereas only five Rafale jets departed from France to India. The Quint had earlier debunked the same video which was viral in 2019 with a claim that \u2018India\u2019s Independence Day was celebrated at the Trafalgar square in London\u2019.", "lang": "en"}
