As he takes in the surroundings of the city\u2019s famous Times Square, the viewer gets a glimpse at some of the billboards that populate the area.\n\nHere\u2019s the clip. You can get a decent look at the \u201ccoronavirus\u201d symbol around the 2:07 mark:\n\nFor comparison\u2019s sake, here\u2019s an illustration of the coronavirus from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):\n\nWhile the circled image in the movie still may appear at first glance to resemble the CDC\u2019s illustration of the coronavirus, the circled image actually shows a billboard for Barilla pasta.\n\nThe closing scene of \u201cCaptain America\u201d was filmed on location in Times Square, which means many of the advertisements in the background were actually being displayed in real-world New York around the time the movie was filmed. This 2011 Shutterstock image, for instance, shows many of the same billboards (including the Corona Light beer and \u201ccoronavirus\u201d signs) in Times Square.\n\nWe found a few other images taken in 2011 that give a much better view of this \u201ccoronavirus\u201d billboard. In this photograph from Flickr photographer Jimmy Svensson, and this image from the French advertising website Lareclame, it\u2019s clear that this billboard actually features an advertisement for Barilla pasta.\n\nWhile we can\u2019t show you those images here for copyright reasons, you can view them on Flickr and Lareclame. We can give readers a glimpse of the general billboard design, which shows Barilla pasta in the shape of a firework:\n\nThe movie \u201cCaptain America\u201d did not predict the COVID-19 pandemic, but briefly showed a Barilla pasta ad in the background. Nine years later, social media users took a blurry screenshot of it and attempted to connect it to a global pandemic.\n\nWe reached out to Barilla, and a spokesperson gave us the following statement, edited slightly for clarity:\n\n\u201cThis is definitely not the type of question we normally find ourselves in the position of being asked \u2026 Any potential reference to the current global pandemic we find ourselves in would be purely coincidental. If the Marvel Universe is able to predict the future, I sure hope I don\u2019t come across any evil demigods who are intent on decimating the planet and the universe.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
