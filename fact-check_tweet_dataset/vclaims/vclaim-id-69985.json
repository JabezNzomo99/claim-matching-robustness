According to the report, the picture was taken during the violent protests that took place in the USA, after the death of George Floyd.\n\nA report from Chicago Suntimes also published a picture of the incident.\n\nWe also found the video of the same incident from a different angle.\n\nThe name \u2018State Lake\u2019 can be seen written on a building, in the picture. Taking a cue from that, we ran a search and found that it is the \u2018State & Lake Chicago Tavern\u2019.\n\nHence, from the above fact check it is clear that the picture is from Chicago and is not related to the recent Norway riots.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
