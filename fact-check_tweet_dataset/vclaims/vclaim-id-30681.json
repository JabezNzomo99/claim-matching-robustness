It has been digitally altered to replace the words \u201cApocalypse Meow\u201d with \u201cCorona Virus\u201d in the graphic behind the news anchor character.\n\nYet, while those episodes do depict viral disease outbreaks, it is inaccurate to say \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d predicted the novel respiratory virus that has so far spread from China to 23 other countries. The episodes depict outbreaks of fictional influenza viruses, and neither originated in China.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak likely started in a wet market in Wuhan, the capital city of China\u2019s Hubei province, Business Insider reported. There have been 20,630 confirmed cases around the world as of Feb. 4, with 20,471 of them occurring in China and 159 in other countries, according to the World Health Organization.", "lang": "en"}
