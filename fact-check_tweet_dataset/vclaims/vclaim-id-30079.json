The Animal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) determined it is safe for pets. This claim has been routinely debunked over the years as a hoax.\n\nThe viral Facebook post contains a story about a german shepherd that died of liver failure after licking Swiffer WetJet cleaning solution from its paws. Two cats also died from the same cause, it claims.\n\n\u201cHe called the company to ask what the contents of the cleaning agent are and was astounded to find out that antifreeze is one of the ingredients,\u201d states the post. \u201cActually he was told it\u2019s a compound which is one molecule away from antifreeze.\u201d\n\nThe Swiffer WetJet cleaning solution does not contain any antifreeze or antifreeze-like compounds, per its material safety data sheet. It mostly comprises of water, but also contains small percentages of propylene glycol n-propyl ether or propylene glycol n-butyl ether. These compounds have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use around humans and animals, according to Mercury News.\n\nProcter & Gamble, the company that manufactures Swiffer WetJet systems, states that its cleaning products are safe for pets on its website.

If Swiffer WetJet cleaning solution caused fatal liver failure in pets, it would have been picked up by the media, yet numerous outlets have actually debunked this claim.\n\nSnopes reported the claim has been circulating in various forms since at least 2004, when people shared a chain email telling a similar dubious story about a dog dying after licking the cleaning solution from its paws.", "lang": "en"}
