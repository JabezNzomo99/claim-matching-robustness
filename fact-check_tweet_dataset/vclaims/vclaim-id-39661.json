The claim is false; the photo actually shows a billboard in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nThe image was published in this Sinhala-language Facebook post on April 29, 2018, where it has been shared more than 54,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe billboard\u2019s English text states: \u201cBuddha is not for decoration, respect is common sense. It\u2019s wrong to use Buddha as tattoo and decoration. Disrespect Buddha is wrong by law.\u201d\n\nThe Sinhala-language text at the top and bottom of the image translates to English as: \u201cThis is a billboard installed in an expressway in Australia\u2019s Melbourne. Even the residents in that country now accept that Buddha\u2019s image must be respected. Share for everyone to see\u201d.\n\nThe post\u2019s Sinhala-language caption translates to English as: \u201cThe entire world knows, we don't\u201d.\n\nThe same photo has been shared here and here on Facebook alongside a similar claim.\n\nBut the photo is being shared in a misleading context; it actually shows a billboard in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nA closer examination of the billboard found it displays the text; \u2018KnowingBuddha.org\u2019 and \u2018Plan B\u2019, as highlighted in yellow in the screenshot below by AFP.\n\nKnowingBuddha.org is a Bangkok based non-profit with a mission to protect Buddha\u2019s images and symbols from disrespectful acts.\n\nPattadon Sangduen, Knowing Buddha\u2019s Deputy Director told AFP in an email on September 26, 2019 that the billboard was installed by KBO.\n\n\"This billboard is put by the Knowing Buddha organisation,\" Pattadon wrote in his email to AFP.\n\nHe said it was one of the first billboards installed by KBO along the Rama 9 expressway -- on the way in and out of Bangkok towards Swarnabhumi airport -- in February 2014.\n\nHe also said the billboards had been put up in other parts of Thailand, including Phuket, Chiang Mai and Hadyai, but had not been deployed anywhere else in the world.\n\nTravellers to Thailand have published similar images of the billboard on travel forums since 2018.\n\nA reverse image on Google found this Reddit thread where a similar image had been posted by a user with the question \u201cI drove past this billboard in bangkok. How do Buddhists feel about the omnipresent Buddha statues?\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Reddit post:\n\nAnother reverse image search found this blog entry about the billboards.\n\nThe blog post\u2019s author noted the billboards were on display near Swarnabhumi airport.", "lang": "en"}
