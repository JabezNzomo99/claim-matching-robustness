At that moment, with almost 60 burials per day, the gravediggers of Vila Formosa were convinced the coronavirus was quietly killing far more people than official statistics showed ( here ). More recent images of the graveyard are visible here .\n\nThe second image is a version of the above against a green screen (the unicolor backdrop often used in filming to be able to edit the background for moving subjects). The claim includes the text \u201ctodo es una mentira\u201d meaning \u201ceverything is a lie\u201d in Spanish, implying the graveyard scene was staged in a studio. However, it is this second image, not the first, that is fake.\n\nThe image of the green screen studio featured in the altered photo is visible here .\n\nAs of July 2, 2020, Brazil has the second most cases of COVID-19, behind the United States with 1,447,523 registered cases and 60,610 deaths ( here ).\n\nFalse. This claim is based on a photo that has been altered to include a green screen studio.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
