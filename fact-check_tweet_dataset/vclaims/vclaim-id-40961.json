He was severely injured in the incident. We shouldn\u2019t allow this to pass, this act of innocent Maqsood being mercilessly beaten. The government should take strict action against the police. How is Maqsood supposed to know what is the situation in this country? How will the poor guy know what is corona?\u201d\n\nThe message gives the impression that the person beaten by the police is deaf and mute.

Vasai police suspected that this group of 8-9 men could have been infected with coronavirus as they were informed that they had attended the Tablighi Jamaat event in New Delhi and the police didn\u2019t want to take any chances.\n\nA team of local policemen and civic staff went to Khan\u2019s residence to conduct tests on the guests. During the test, none of them was found symptomatic for the viral infection. While the police was returning with the civic team, Khan and his guests reportedly started bursting firecrackers. The police went back and asked them not to indulge in such activities as it was in defiance of social distancing norms. According to a statement by SP Gaurav Singh to the Mumbai Mirror, Khan and his guests started pushing the policemen and asking them to vacate the place. Later, the group became aggressive. While the police had to resort to lathi-charge in order to disperse the group, residents of the locality captured the incident on camera.
