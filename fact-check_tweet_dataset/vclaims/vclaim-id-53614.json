The claim is false; the video has circulated online since at least 2010 in social media posts about a leopard sighting in south India.\n\nThe four-minute 36-second clip has been viewed more than 5,000 times after being published on Facebook here on May 9, 2020.\n\nThe caption of the now-deleted post reads: \u201cBlack leopard in Sri Lanka\u201d.\n\nThe same footage was shared with a similar claim on Facebook here. It was also published on YouTube here and here alongside a similar claim that the sighting occurred in the Horton Plains, a national park in southern Sri Lanka.\n\nA Google reverse image search with keyframes extracted using InVID-WeVerify, a digital verification tool, found that the footage had circulated in social media posts about a black leopard sighting in south India in 2010.\n\nIt was published on YouTube here on March 31, 2010, with the title \u201cBlack Panther - Ghost of the Hills\u201d.\n\nThe description of the video reads in part: \u201cThis might be the first ever video footage of the Black panthers also known as Black leopards shot in their natural Habitat in India.
