Some news reports refer to the boy as Vimalesh Sah.\n\nA mob from the deceased's village in Damodarpur took to vandalizing and burning local shops following his death. They alleged that the youth was strangled and later thrown on the railway tracks as a cover-up. The mob also alleged that a few houses near the railway tracks were involved in prostitution and alleged that locals living there were involved in the boy's death as he reportedly had given information on a sex racket to the police.\n\nTaking the law into their own hands, the irate mob vandalized and set on fire the houses near the railway tracks. They then dragged a woman living there out on to the street, assaulted, disrobed and paraded her.\n\nThe identity of the woman in the video is not known. Her current condition is not known though news reports at the time said she was taken to a hospital and was under police protection.\n\n15 people who were a part of the mob were arrested after police identified them from video footage, news reports said.\n\nEight police personnel, including the Bihiya police station in-charge, were suspended for dereliction of duty, the Indian Express reported.\n\nBhojpur Superintendent of Police Awkash Kumar was not immediately reachable when contacted by BOOM. We will update the story upon receiving a response.", "lang": "en"}
