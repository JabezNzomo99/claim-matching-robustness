You can imagine these people\u2019s delight to discover, for example, that the current edition of Merriam-Webster defines trumpery as \u201cworthless nonsense,\u201d or a collection of \u201ctrivial but useless articles.\u201d And that\u2019s just for starters:\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary, as historian Simon Schama noted in November 2015, defines trumpery thusly:\n\nNor is this a new usage. The 1780 edition of Thomas Sheridan\u2019s General Dictionary of the English Language yields a very similar definition:\n\nThe list of synonyms for trumpery leaves nothing to the imagination:\n\nTo be absolutely clear, however, apart from their being partial homonyms, the proper name Trump, which is a simplification of Drumpf, a surname of German origin, is not linguistically related to trumpery, the root of which is French, and originally meant \u201cto deceive.\u201d The Merriam-Webster web site explains:\n\nTrumpery derives from the Middle English trompery and ultimately from the Middle French tromper, meaning \u201cto deceive.\u201d (You can see the meaning of this root reflected in the French phrase trompe-l\u2019oeil-literally, \u201cdeceives the eye\u201d-which in English refers to a style of painting with photographically realistic detail.) Trumpery first appeared in English in the mid-15th century with the meanings \u201cdeceit or fraud\u201d (a sense that is now obsolete) and \u201cworthless nonsense.\u201d Less than 100 years later, it was being applied to material objects of little or no value. The verb phrase trump up means \u201cto concoct with the intent to deceive,\u201d but there is most likely no etymological connection between this phrase and trumpery.\n\nNot to put too fine a point on it, but anyone who tries to convince you that there is anything deeper than a rhetorical connection between Trump, trump up, and trumpery is engaging in a boldfaced example of the latter.
