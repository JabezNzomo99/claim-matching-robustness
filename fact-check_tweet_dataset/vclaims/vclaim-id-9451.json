Yet experts said it was always anticipated that the three-year war against the Islamic State that was started by Mr. Obama in 2014 would reach this point, and military officials are quick to praise local troops and fighters for battleground victories.\n\n\u201cJust by looking at the map, the losses this year are off the scale compared to previous years,\u201d said Columb Strack, an analyst at the research firm IHS Markit, which has been tracking the territory that the Islamic State has surrendered. But, he added, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any major differences in the U.S. approach against the Islamic State.\u201d The ferocity of Operation Inherent Resolve, the American campaign against the Islamic State, has accelerated in nearly every way over the past year. In the spring, Mr. Trump loosened the rules of battlefield engagement to give American commanders on the ground more authority in day-to-day decisions in fighting the Islamic State. Those rules were more restrictive under the Obama administration, and experts said easing them might have helped ramp up the assault against the Islamic State \u2014 and, perhaps by extension, the death toll and civilian casualties.\n\nEarly Tuesday, the Syrian Democratic Forces declared it had liberated Raqqa. Col. Ryan S. Dillon, the Pentagon\u2019s top spokesman in Baghdad, estimated that the American-backed militia of Kurds and Arabs now controlled more than 90 percent of the city in northern Syria, and about 350 Islamic State fighters had surrendered. Colonel Dillon cautioned, however, that \u201cclearance operations continue\u201d and Raqqa was not yet free of the Islamic State. Raqqa has been an imminent target since last October, before Mr. Trump\u2019s election. The battle for Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second-largest city, began that same month; the city\u2019s east fell two days before he took office. It was not until this summer, however, that Iraqi leaders announced they had freed Mosul from the Islamic State after its three-year occupation.\n\n Military data show that actions taken under Mr. Trump\u2019s command have not eclipsed all efforts in the American-led coalition before he took office \u2014 or, for that matter, do not represent a drastic change from the earlier mission. Rather, they reflect an incremental increase that shifted as the fighting moved from sparsely-populated areas to urban centers. As of Oct. 16, the latest numbers available, the American-led military coalition that is fighting the Islamic State had carried out an estimated 28,051 airstrikes since 2014, according to the United States Central Command. As of Sept. 30, it had released 92,262 bombs. About two-thirds of the strikes, and 60 percent of the bombs dropped, occurred before Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. The air campaign has steadily escalated over the years \u2014 and not suddenly swelled in 2017, as Mr. Trump has claimed. So far this year, the coalition has conducted 9,300 strikes, as of Oct. 16, and dropped 36,531 bombs. While that is an increase from the airstrikes and bombs dropped at this point in 2016, the numbers from last year are themselves an increase from 2015. The total number of Islamic State militants who have been killed also appears to have peaked this year \u2014 but at only a slightly higher rate than in years past.\n\nA comparison of deaths of Islamic State militants \u2014 from what Mr. Bergen estimated was about 1,500 fighters a month during the Obama years to more than 2,000 a month since Mr. Trump took office \u2014 supports the growing increase. He credited intense military operations in Mosul and Raqqa for the rise. The aggressive military campaign has also taken its toll on civilians. Coalition strikes had killed at least 199 civilians from 2014 to Feb. 2 of this year, according to the United States Central Command. That number had increased to at least 735 as of Sept. 29. The monitoring group Airwars puts the civilian death toll much higher: at least 15,825 as of Sept. 30. Chris Woods, the director of Airwars, says the number of civilian deaths has more than tripled this year. Given local troops\u2019 heightened battlefield roles in Iraq and Syria, American military officials and experts agree that the fight would probably have come to its current stage \u2014 no matter who was in the White House.\n\n That may also explain the vast amount of territory recaptured from the Islamic State \u2014 about 14,000 square miles \u2014 so far this year. The White House has cited the lost territory as proof of significant progress against the extremists under Mr. Trump\u2019s watch. Mr. Strack said those wins were reflective of \u201cconditions on the ground\u201d and largely driven by the Syrian regime\u2019s rapid advancements this year. Syrian and Iraqi forces have \u201cdominated\u201d over the Islamic State in recent months, Colonel Dillon said. However, he estimated that 6,500 Islamic State militants remained in Iraq and Syria, and that fighting would continue in Raqqa and the Euphrates River Valley.", "lang": "en"}
