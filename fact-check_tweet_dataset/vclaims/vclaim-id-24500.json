People who talk about brotherhood and mourn like widows for secularism will not see this -translated)\u201d. At the time of writing this article, the tweet has garnered more than 450 retweets.\n\nAt the beginning of July 2019, the same video was shared with the narrative that the Muslim community was out on roads in Agra to protest against the mob-lynching of Tabrez Ansari in Jharkhand. Videos posted with identical narrative by Facebook pages \u2013 Ai MiM Rayachoty youth and Dhaka New imim Club \u2013 have been shared close to 37,000 times and viewed in excess of 7 lakh times.\n\n\n\nUsing the digital verification Invid, Alt News broke the video into multiple frames and found a fact-check article published by Aaj Tak. According to the article, the video is from Gopalganj, Bihar. The same video posted by a YouTube user on November 4, 2014, was one of the earliest instances that Alt News could trace. From 0:24 mins to 1:17 mins in this longer version of the same video, the 53-second viral clipping can be seen.\n\nSeeing this video, it is evident that the audio heard in the viral clip, now falsely shared as from Agra, was superimposed with the sloganeering against PM Modi, Shiv Sena and Bajrang Dal. In the unadulterated version of the video posted in 2014, only the sounds of drum beating can be heard.\n\nWith a Google search of the slogan\u201c\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0930\u0939\u0928\u093e \u0939\u094b\u0917\u093e \u0905\u0932\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0939 \u0939\u0942 \u0905\u0915\u092c\u0930 \u0915\u0939\u0928\u093e \u0939\u094b\u0917\u093e (If you want to live in India then you will have to say Allah hu Akbar -translation)\u201d, Alt News found a YouTube video posted on December 29, 2017. From the start till 53 seconds in the video posted below, the same audio which was superimposed over the viral clipping can be heard.\n\nAccording to a report by India TV, the said incident took place in Udaipur on December 13, 2017, where similar slogans against Shiv Sena, Bajrang Dal and PM Modi were chanted. The protest took place in the backdrop of the brutal killing of a Muslim labourer, by a man named Shambu Lal Regar. It was held at Chetak Circle in Udaipur, Rajasthan.\n\nIn conclusion, it may be stated,\n\n1. The video is of a Muharram procession which took place in Bihar in 2014\n\n2. The audio is from a protest which took place in Udaipur, Rajasthan in 2017\n\nThis clip was manufactured by superimposing the audio from the Udaipur protest on to the video from Bihar.", "lang": "en"}
