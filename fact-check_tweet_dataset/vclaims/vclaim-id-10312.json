This is a common practice of websites carrying fake news. Another giveaway is the website's name: ABIAS-CBN\n\nThe story came out during Holy Week. That week the actress starred in the March 28 taped episode of Eat Bulaga's Lenten special.\n\nMendoza's official Twitter account shows her tweeting on March 28 that she had sore throat while on vacation. She even joked, \"I swear I'm ready to slit my throat any second.\"\n\nOn April 2, her Facebook and Twitter accounts show her ecstatic over the launching of her \"Humans of Barangay\" project for Eat Bulaga's Juan for All segment.\n\nThe imposter website ran two recycled photos: one of Mendoza and the other showing actors Joey de Leon and Alden Richards in grief. De Leon and Richards' photo first appeared in 2015 on De Leon's Instagram account.\n\nThe biggest traffic generator on social media is Facebook page President Duterte Supporters.\n\nEditor's note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.", "lang": "en"}
