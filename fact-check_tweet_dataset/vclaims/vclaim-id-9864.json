In a CBS News documentary, the 17-year-old said: \u201cOn the day of the shooting, I got my camera and got on my bike and rode as fast as I could three miles from my house to the school to get as much video and to get as many interviews as I could because I knew that this could not be another mass shooting.\u201d\n\nWith a glaring spelling error in its headline, the website julyfourthnews.com declared on March 28: \u201cDavid Hogg Unintentially Reveals He Was Not At School When Parkland Shooting Happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cSHOCK: David Hogg Changes Story, Wasn\u2019t At School When Cruz Opened Fire,\u201d reads bigleaguepolitics.com\u2019s March 26 headline.\n\nBut at no point did Hogg ever say that in the CBS News documentary, \u201c39 Days,\u201d or elsewhere.\n\nInterviews and videos published in the days after the shooting support Hogg\u2019s narrative that he was at the school when the shooter opened fire and that Hogg went home at some point and returned to the scene later that night.\n\nIn fact, Hogg, a student journalist and member of the school\u2019s news show, recorded interviews with his peers inside the school as it remained locked down. The Miami Herald published that footage Feb. 15, which shows Hogg asking his fellow students about their views on gun control.\n\nTime also published a video on Feb. 15 that was recorded by Hogg during the lockdown. In it, Hogg says \u201cit\u2019s 2:52\u201d and that he \u201cheard one gunshot.\u201d (The shooting reportedly occurred from 2:21 p.m. to 2:28 p.m., and the lockdown was lifted at 3:36 p.m.)\n\n\u201cOnce we were all in the room and we started seeing the headlines, we realized this was anything but a drill \u2014 this was life or death,\u201d Hogg said in a MSNBC interview the day after the shooting. \u201cAnd that actually was when I started recording. Because I realized that if I died, and if everyone else around me died, I wanted to have our voices heard.\u201d\n\nHogg told MSNBC and Time magazine that he was in an AP environmental science class when the attack occurred.\n\nTime reported that Hogg and other students tried to exit the building after a fire alarm went off, but a janitor sent them back. \u201cA culinary arts teacher, Ashley Kurth, pulled Hogg and others inside [a classroom], locked the door, and made them hide in a closet,\u201d Time wrote.\n\nKurth confirmed that account weeks later in a March 30 report by the Associated Press.\n\n\u201cI physically grabbed David by the arm and pulled him into my room,\u201d Kurth said. \u201cIt is extremely frustrating the kind of information that is being put out there.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Vox that was published Feb. 20, Hogg said he rode his bike back to the school at 6 p.m. that night with his camera to do more filming. He was interviewed that night by Fox News.\n\nAt least some who shared the fictitious claims later realized as much.\n\nA writer for the conservative blog RedState, who reported that the CBS video \u201cis casting doubt\u201d on Hogg\u2019s whereabouts during the shooting, retracted her March 26 story and issued a tweet-thread apology. The story\u2019s original headline was changed to read: \u201cUPDATE: CBS Video Confusing. Hogg Was On Campus.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nD\u2019Abrosca, Peter. \u201cSHOCK: David Hogg Changes Story, Wasn\u2019t At School When Cruz Opened Fire.\u201d bigleaguepolitics.com. 26 Mar 2018.\n\n\u201cDavid Hogg Unintentially Reveals He Was Not At School When Parkland Shooting Happened.\u201d julyfourthnews.com. 28 Mar 2018.\n\nFleshler, David and Yiran Zhu. \u201cTimeline: How the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting unfolded.\u201d The Sun-Sentinel. 9 Mar 2018.\n\nKirby, Jen. \u201cFlorida shooting survivor explains how his generation can force a change on guns.\u201d Vox.com. 20 Feb 2018.\n\n\u201cNot real news: Sites make false claim shooting survivor David Hogg not in school.\u201d Associated Press. 30 Mar 2018.\n\nPrusher, Ilene. \u201cA Student Started Filming During the Florida School Shooting.
