Open your eyes wide and see sycophants, this is how a lion walks.\"\n\nThe video can be viewed here and its archived version can be accessed here.\n\nThe two-minute-long video, shot on a mobile camera, shows a huge crowd walking behind a vehicle decorated with marigold flowers. Walking closely behind it, are PM Modi and Shah, flanked by security personnel.\n\nThe decorated vehicle, actually, is a hearse carrying the mortal remains of Vajpayee.\n\nWhen BOOM ran a reverse image search, we found several news reports with similar video clips. The video is from the funeral procession of Atal Bihari Vajpayee.\n\nVajpayee breathed his last on August 16, 2018. A funeral procession was held from Old Delhi Gate on August 17.\n\nHowever, since the viral video is shot from what appears to be a balcony, the chants of 'Atal Bihari Amar Rahe (Long live Atal Bihari) cannot be heard clearly.", "lang": "en"}
