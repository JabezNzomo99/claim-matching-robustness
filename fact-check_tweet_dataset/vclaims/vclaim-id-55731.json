Abhishek Bachchan also posted the same on his Instagram account, but soon deleted it.\n\nEven Arshad Warsi tweeted the image with a caption that in the current depressing times, such messages are a source of motivation.\n\nYou can view the archive of the tweet here.\n\nAlso Read: False: Viral Message Claiming 11 New Lockdown Rules In Mumbai\n\nThe former chairman of Tata Sons, took to Twitter to refute the quote and requested users to verify the messages being shared on WhatsApp and other social media platforms.\n\nBOOM also searched the text on Google to find the origin of this statement. The quote was first uploaded on April 9, 2020 on a website called purplerealtors, a Pune based Real Estate Agency. The message was a blog post and was not attributed to any specific person and Tata was not mentioned in the original post.\n\nThe Tata Group of Companies has donated over Rs 1500 cr to assist in fighting the COVID-19 outbreak in the country. These funds are to be used towards manufacturing personal protective equipment, testing kits, respiratory systems and training and management of medical staff.\n\nIndia has so far reported 7447 cases and 239 deaths due to the virus SARS-COV-2.\n\nThis is not the first time BOOM has debunked a statement falsely attributed to Ratan Tata. In the past, a quote about not recruiting students of JNU for Tata Group of Companies was falsely attributed to Tata. Earlier, BOOM debunked fake quotes of him claimed to be taking potshots at Pakistan and the Congress, and before the Lok Sabha elections, BOOM debunked a story where a fake Twitter handle made people believe that he commented against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nAlso Read: 2015 Video From Philadelphia Peddled As Coronavirus Suicide In Italy", "lang": "en"}
