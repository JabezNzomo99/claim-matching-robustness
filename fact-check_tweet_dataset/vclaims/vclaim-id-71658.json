That figure, an incorrect interpretation of a 2017 study, has also been cited in numerous online publications in the past two years. But the study actually states 10 rivers are the source of 88 to 95 percent of the total plastic waste transported by rivers into oceans \u2014 not the global amount of plastic present in the oceans.\n\nThe meme reads: \"FACT - 95% of the ocean's [sic] plastic pollution comes from just ten rivers, all of which are in Asia or Africa,\" adding, \"Once again, Canada is not the problem. Don't let Justin Trudeau fool Canadians.\"\n\nThe image, which has been shared more than 4,000 times since mid-June 2019, was posted by multiple Facebook pages archived here, here and here. The claim has also been taken up in videos, including one published on the Facebook page of the World Economic Forum.\n\nThe claim appears to be based on a 2017 study titled, \"Export of Plastic Debris by Rivers into the Sea\" by Christian Schmidt (et al) from the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) in Germany.\n\nMany media outlets, including The Sun, Sky News and The Times, reported on that research stating that around 90 percent of plastic waste in the world's oceans appeared to come from 10 rivers. Some publications, including The Daily Mail and The Express, have since corrected their stories to clarify that the study concerned river-borne waste and not the entire plastic load polluting the oceans.\n\nBut Schmidt's study did not conclude that 10 rivers transport 88 to 95 percent of the total plastic load found in the oceans.\n\nIt estimated that 88 to 95 percent of the plastic transported by 1,350 large rivers around the world \u2014 referred to by scientists as riverine waste \u2014 comes from only 10 rivers, all of which are in Asia and Africa. The study does not attempt to compare the plastic waste transported by rivers to the total plastic waste in seas and oceans.\n\nSchmidt told AFP that the estimate in the study was not for the total plastic waste in the ocean.\n\n\"It\u2019s just the riverine. It does not include all the other sources that are out there,\" Schmidt said.\n\nWhere did the confusion arise?\n\nThe confusion possibly came from a press release about the study, published on October 17, 2017 on the UFZ's website that stated that UFZ researchers \"have also calculated that the ten river systems with the highest plastic loads (eight of them are in Asia and two in Africa) \u2014 areas in which hundreds of millions of people live, in some cases \u2014 are responsible for around 90 percent of the global input of plastic into the sea\".\n\nSchmidt also recognised that a section of his paper that refers to how \"the 10 top-ranked rivers transport 88\u221295% of the global load into the sea\" could be misinterpreted at first glance. Schmidt said he regretted the misrepresentation of his study in a number of news articles.\n\n\"It's often written that 90 percent of the entire land-based plastic that ends up in the ocean comes from ten rivers. And this is not true,\" he said.\n\nSchmidt told AFP that the UFZ had recently contacted him after being notified of the misleading nature of the original press release. \"We are trying to fix that, because it should not be unclear,\" he said.\n\nWhat does the study conclude?\n\nSchmidt's study estimated the amount of plastic waste in 1,350 rivers around the world, based on previous studies of those rivers. Rivers of all sizes were included, \"from small first order streams to large rivers which all discharge to the sea.\"\n\nSchmidt and his colleagues analyzed how the polluted rivers contributed to the total plastic load transported to oceans worldwide, using two different mathematical models.\n\nThe study estimated that between 0.41 and 4 million metric tons of plastic waste in oceans derives from rivers. In addition, it concluded that the 10 most polluted rivers account for 88 to 95 percent of that amount (the 0.41 to 4 million metric tons).\n\nThe difference of 7 percentage points \u2014 between 88 and 95 percent \u2014 is due to the two different models used in the study. The first takes into account studies measuring only microplastic while the second includes studies on both micro- and macroplastics.\n\nMicroplastics are plastic particles found in the environment that are less than five millimeters long. Macroplastics are pieces longer than five millimeters.\n\nIt's hard to know exactly how much of the plastic in our oceans comes from rivers\n\nLaurent Lebreton, a researcher specialized in marine pollution, explained in a 2017 study \u2014 quoted by Schmidt in his research \u2014 that other significant sources of plastic present present in oceans include litter from beaches and discharge from the shipping and fishing industry.\n\nHowever, Lebreton\u2019s most recent study, in 2019, suggests that \"rivers are major pathways for plastic litter to the ocean\".\n\nCalculating the exact quantity of plastic in the ocean that comes from rivers, however, is difficult, according to Schmidt. \"The ocean accumulates over many, many years, so it's very hard to say how much the rivers entirely contribute to the actual plastic that resides in the ocean,\" he told AFP.", "lang": "en"}
