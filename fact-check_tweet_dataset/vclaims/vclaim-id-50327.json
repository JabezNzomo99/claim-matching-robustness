The claim is false; this video has previously circulated in reports about a doctor at a clinic in Malaysia; the local health department in Malaysia said it had investigated the incident and \u201cresolved\u201d the issue.\n\nThe video was published in this Facebook post on February 18, 2020.\n\nIt has been viewed more than 56,000 times and shared some 1,800 times.\n\nThe 28-second clip shows an irate doctor sitting at a desk, being questioned by someone in a clinic.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s caption states: \u201cSingapore Polyclinic Doctors very stressed, Patients keep on coming in to see doctor. Non Stop\u201d.\n\nIn the clip, as part of the conversation goes, the doctor can be heard shouting: \u201c...after I settle this patient\u201d.\n\nA man behind the camera can be heard saying: \u201cYa, you made a mistake, then you want to settle. How long do you want me to wait?\u201d\n\nThe doctor replies: \u201cYou can wait or not, if you cannot wait, get out\u201d, to which the man says: \u201cNo, I cannot wait.\u201d\n\nA female voice behind the camera can then be heard saying: \u201cOh, so you are a government doctor, is it? Show me your face, show me your face. Are you a government doctor?\u201d to which the doctor replies: \u201cYes\u201d. The woman ends with: \u201cToday, you\u2019ll be very viral.\u201d\n\nThe same video was also published here, here, here and here on Facebook with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false. The video has circulated in media reports about an incident at a clinic in Malaysia.\n\nA combined reverse image and keyword search on Google of a keyframe extracted from the video found this article published on February 18, 2020 by Malaysia-based newspaper the New Straits Times (NST).\n\nThe article\u2019s headline reads: \u201cDoctor loses cool at Rasah clinic, video goes viral\u201d.\n\nThe first two paragraphs of the report states: \u201cA video clip has gone viral in which a government doctor attached with a health clinic in Rasah, Negri Sembilan lost his cool and shouted at a patient.\n\n\u201cIn the 28-second video clip, the doctor, who appeared to be visibly upset and irritable as he shouted at a patient and her companion, believed to be her father, to either wait or leave the consultation room.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the NST article:\n\nA report about the same video was also published here by the Malaysia-based news portal, Malaysiakini, on the same date.\n\nIt reads, in part: \u201cThe Negeri Sembilan Health Department (JKNNS) said the case of a doctor purportedly losing his temper with a patient has been resolved through negotiations (rundingcara) between both sides.\n\n\u201cA recording of the incident, which took place at a government clinic in Seremban, had gone viral on social media.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Malaysiakini article:\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading posts (L), an image from the NST article (centre), and an image from the Malaysiakini article (R):\n\nThe reports say the video was recorded at a health clinic in Seremban, a town located in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia.\n\nThe Negeri Sembilan Health Department (JKNNS) posted a statement on February 18, 2020 on their official Facebook page on the incident.\n\nThe Malay-language post translates to English, in part, as: \u201cThe Negeri Sembilan Health Department (JKNNS) would like to refer to the complaint that went viral on Facebook and Whatsapp on February 17, 2020 by Miss Loshsine Uthi Kumaran Loshyy regarding the unsatisfactory service of a doctor at Seremban Health Clinic.\n\n\u201cJKNNS takes this issue very seriously and early investigations regarding the incident have been conducted immediately. The complainant has also been contacted in order to obtain more information. As of now, the issue has been resolved through negotiations between both parties.\u201d\n\nFormer Malaysian Health Minister Dr. Dzulkefly Ahmad tweeted about the incident here.\n\nHis tweet, translated from Malay to English, reads: \u201cMy response about the video of the doctor-patient: \u201cWhile I would like to remind all MOH staff to be professional in doing their duty, I would also like to remind the patient/dependents to be courteous when receiving treatment and to not make recordings when receiving treatment\u201d \u201d.", "lang": "en"}
