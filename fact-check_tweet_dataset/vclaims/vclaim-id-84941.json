In the interview, Conway pointed to an Aug. 25 meeting held at Trump Tower with African Americans in a Republican National Committee leadership program. There were 13 people who were not with the RNC or the Trump campaign there. Conway painted Trump\u2019s outreach as unique, because \u201cRepublican presidential nominees usually aren\u2019t bold enough to go into communities of color and take the case right to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say to Negroes, \u2018Come to us,\u2019 we\u2019ve got to go after them,\u201d Nixon said in the 1962 interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to change the image of the GOP among Negroes. The Democrats are well organized and well financed \u2014 but we\u2019ve got to get into the Negro areas if we expect to mold a party for all people. We\u2019ve got to convince Negroes they\u2019re better off economically under a GOP president.\u201d\n\nSince 1976, three presidential nominees other than Trump have declined to speak at the NAACP convention in an election year, according to the organization. Reagan did not speak in 1980, but he did in 1981 and apologized, saying the invitation in 1980 had arrived late. Reagan instead spoke to the National Urban League in 1980. Reagan once visited the South Bronx and told residents he would work to rebuild the area \u2014 though he ultimately ended up in a shouting match with residents.\n\nRobert J. Dole did not speak at the July 1996 NAACP convention, citing a scheduling conflict. But he also had said that the president of the NAACP was \u201ctrying to set me up\u201d to be embarrassed. Dole\u2019s aides suggested that attending the meeting would have been like walking into a lion\u2019s den, and his rejection was seen as a snub to black leaders. Two months later, Dole and his vice presidential nominee Jack Kemp attended the NABJ convention, where Dole apologized for declining the NAACP invite.\n\nTalking directly to African American communities and audiences has been a routine part of general-election campaigning for both parties, said Leah Wright Rigueur, an expert on black Republican politics and professor at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government. It hasn\u2019t always been sophisticated or nuanced, and it doesn\u2019t always work, but the candidates have still made their pitch. There\u2019s been no such direct outreach effort by the Trump campaign, Wright Rigueur said.\n\n\u201cOne of the constants, one of the common threads that run throughout all of this is actually getting up and going into black communities, and not just talking about black people,\u201d Wright Rigueur said. \u201cNot just lecturing. Not preaching. But actually listening to African Americans and saying, these are the kinds of issues that you\u2019re facing and I want to put forward solutions to really address these issues.\u201d\n\nConway said in a response to The Fact Checker that Trump has taken steps to reach out to communities of color. Last week, there was a roundtable with black and Latino Republican leaders, where they laid out their concerns to Trump, she said. Trump is scheduled to speak at a black church in Detroit, where he will talk about issues affecting the community, such as unemployment, education and safety in the inner city, she said.\n\nUp against Barack Obama, the first African American president, \u201cJohn McCain got 4 percent of the African American vote, and Mitt Romney improved that to a whopping 6 percent. We are fighting for every single vote,\u201d Conway added. \u201cThat includes going where the voters are and not just checking the box; taking the case directly to them. Detroit is the first step; in the coming weeks you will continue to see Mr. Trump becoming more active in these communities.\u201d\n\nWe noted to her our finding that every previous Republican nominee made a direct case in some way, such as the forums she mentioned, and our conclusion that her claim was inaccurate. Conway responded: \u201cThe claim is correct, unless one conflates official forums with \u2018communities of color.\u2019 They are different. We are saying the same thing, but your conclusion is different.\u201d\n\nAs a longtime Republican pollster, Conway should know more about the history of Republican outreach to black communities than most others at the Trump campaign. On its face, this claim is not correct. Republican presidential nominees have routinely made a direct pitch to communities of color, taking their case right to them \u2014 at the most basic level, they have done so through a speech to the NAACP, National Urban League or religious groups.\n\nConway clarified her claim to say that Republicans \u201chave occasionally shown up at different forums, but they do not continue with this message trying to reach all Americans\u201d in communities of color. Trump is gearing up his black community outreach, and he certainly is doing it in his own way \u2014 like he has done so with the rest of the campaign. It remains to be seen whether Trump deserves credit, or whether he\u2019ll go beyond what Republicans have done in the past. So far, by declining to speak at the NAACP, National Urban League and NABJ, Trump has not met the basic level of what his predecessors have routinely done.", "lang": "en"}
