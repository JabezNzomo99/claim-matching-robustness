He wrote, \u201cIf you want to take part in protests against CAA and NRC (provisions for which are yet to be implemented), you have to wear burqa or hijab. These people want to push the country toward Sharia law.\u201d\n\nPrashant Patel Umarao, an infamous name in the misinformation ecosystem, also circulated the claim on both Twitter and Facebook. He wrote, \u201cProtest is against CAA but the dress code is hijab and burqa. They\u2019ll get freedom from patriarchy and manuvad by wearing burqa and hijab. In simple words, this isn\u2019t an all-India protest but a show of strength. Hindu\u2019s patience is being tested.\u201d\n\nA keyword search on Twitter leads one to the original poster.\n\n1. The sentence \u2018Dress code for women: Hijab or Burqa\u2019 has been added and a morphed poster has been presented on social media. Amir Edresy, who identifies himself as \u2018Founder President, Association of Muslim Professionals\u2019 on Twitter shared the poster on January 15, 2020. It informs about a women\u2019s protest organised by Mumbai Citizens Forum against CAA, NRC and NPR to held at YMCA Ground, Agripada in Mumbai on January 17 at 6 pm.\n\nAlt News contacted Aamir Edresy from Mumbai Citizens Forum, who is a part of the organising committee of the protest. \u201cThis is mischevious. The protest is open to every person irrespective of faith. There is no dress code,\u201d he said.\n\nThe original poster was also tweeted by the handle \u2018CAA / NRC Protest info.\u2019 on January 16.\n\n2. Another giveaway that the poster has been morphed is the use of lower case alphabet. All words are written in capital letters on the original poster.\n\n3. The sentence \u2018Dress code for women: Hijab or Burqa\u2019 is not aligned with the rest of the text on the poster, as indicated by the red margin on the image below.\n\nHANDLES FOLLOWED BY PM MODI AMPLIFY THE FALSE CLAIM\n\nA Twitter handle #IndiaFirst (@savitha_rao) was among those who shared the morphed poster. \u201cSo women of all faiths have to dress in burkha or hijab? In addition to Rs 500 and biryani will there be a clothing Allowance too?\u201d reads the tweet. The handle is followed by prime minister Narendra Modi.\n\nAnother user Saurabh Singh, who is followed the PM in addition to union minister Piyush Goyal and BJP spokesperson Tajinder Bagga, also tweeted the edited poster.\n\nSeveral other users followed by PM Modi have propagated the misinformation.\n\nAn anti-CAA poster was morphed to falsely depict that the rally demands all women adorn a hijab or a burqa.", "lang": "en"}
