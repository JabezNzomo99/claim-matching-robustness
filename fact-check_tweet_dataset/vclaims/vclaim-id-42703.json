Twitter user Vidyasagar Jagadeesan posted the video with the message, \u201cMigrants throwing food given to them on the platform. Worst culture. Govt and agencies provide them food for their journey. But this is how they treat it.\u201d It has been retweeted more than 600 times so far.\n\nSwarajya columnist Vikas Saraswat quote-tweeted the video and opined, \u201cDisgusting behaviour. We often blame politicians, Babus, this and that. The real problem is indisciplined, selfish, mean minded folks with no sense of nationalism and societal obligation. Yes all Indians aren\u2019t like that but these are still large numbers to affect nationally.\u201d\n\nAlt News has also received several requests on its official Android application to fact-check this video.\n\nAnother claim suggests the passengers are migrant workers from Maharastra\n\nThe video is also getting shared on Facebook and Twitter with Marathi text, \u201c\u0905\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0902\u0924 \u0916\u0947\u0926\u093e\u091a\u0940 \u0917\u094b\u0937\u094d\u091f \u0906\u0939\u0947* \u092f\u093e \u092a\u0930\u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0902\u0924\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0902\u0928\u093e \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u092d\u0930\u092d\u0930\u0942\u0928 \u0926\u093f\u0932\u0947 \u0924\u0947\u091a \u0906\u0924\u093e \u0906\u092a\u093e\u092a\u0932\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0917\u093e\u0935\u0940 \u091c\u093e\u0924\u093e\u0928\u093e \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0932\u093e \u0936\u093f\u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0936\u093e\u092a \u0926\u0947\u0924 \u091a\u093e\u0932\u0932\u0947 \u0906\u0939\u0947\u0924 \u0924\u0947 \u0938\u0941\u0916\u0930\u0942\u092a \u0917\u093e\u0935\u0940 \u092a\u094b\u091a\u093e\u0935\u0947 \u092e\u094d\u0939\u0923\u0942\u0928 \u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u091c\u0947\u0935\u0923, \u0917\u093e\u0921\u0940 \u092f\u093e\u0902\u091a\u0940 \u0935\u094d\u092f\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0925\u093e \u0915\u0930\u0942\u0928 \u0926\u093f\u0932\u0940 \u0924\u0930\u0940\u0939\u0940 \u091c\u0947\u0935\u0923 \u0930\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0935\u0930 \u092b\u0947\u0915\u0942\u0928 \u0926\u0947\u0924 \u091a\u093e\u0932\u0932\u0947 \u0906\u0939\u0947\u0924 \u0915\u093f\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u093e \u092e\u093e\u091c \u092a\u0923 \u090f\u0915 \u0917\u094b\u0937\u094d\u091f \u0932\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0924 \u0920\u0947\u0935\u093e \u092a\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0939\u093e \u092f\u093e\u0932 \u0924\u0930 \u092f\u093e\u0926 \u0930\u093e\u0916\u093e\u201d.\n\nthe text suggests that the incident took place in Maharastra where migrants workers threw relief food and cursed the state.\n\nAlt News found that the video shows an incident of stale food being thrown by migrant workers travelling from Ernakulam in Kerala to Danapur in Bihar at West Bengal\u2019s Asansol station. The video was shot on May 4, 2020. According to a report by The Quint, many of the migrant labourers complained that the food was stale and started throwing it on the railway station. In another video of the same incident posted below, one can hear the migrants saying that the food stinks and it\u2019s inedible.\n\nResponding to a user who shared the video, the official handle of Indian Railways Seva tweeted on May 5, \u201cMaam, it was yesterday incident and alternative arrangement was done at Jhajha station . Also corrective measures have taken to avoid such issue.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with The Quint, Eastern Railways PRO Ekalabya Chakraborty said, \u201cThe food arrangement was made by IRCTC. In some coaches, it was reported that the food was not up to the mark. There is no question of denial. There were problems with the food. Because of the paucity of time, we couldn\u2019t rectify it at the Asansol station itself. However, we arranged for food again in the next station. It was a mishap, yes. But we tried to rectify it.\u201d Twitter user Vidyasagar later clarified that the passengers threw the food as it was stale.\n\nThus, the video showed migrants travelling from Kerala to Bihar throwing stale food at a railway station in West Bengal, however, it was falsely claimed that the incident happened in Maharashtra. More importantly, social media claims failed to highlight the reason that compelled these migrants to throw the food. As admitted by the Indian Railways, the food had gone bad.", "lang": "en"}
