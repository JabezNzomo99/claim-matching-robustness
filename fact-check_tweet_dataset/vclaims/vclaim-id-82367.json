The message ends with the statement \u2013 \u201cGaurav Pradhan had warned us.\u201d From a Facebook group Narendra Damodar Modi Supporter, the message received 1,100 shares.\n\nIt is viral on both Facebook and Twitter with the Hindi text \u2013 \u201c\u092a\u092a\u094d\u092a\u0942 \u0915\u0940 \u0938\u093e\u0907\u0915\u094b \u092c\u0939\u0928 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u0902\u0915\u093e \u0928\u0947 \u0926\u0941\u092c\u0908 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092a\u093e\u0915 \u0906\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0940 \u091a\u0940\u092b \u092c\u093e\u091c\u0935\u093e \u0938\u0947 7 \u092b\u093c\u0930\u0935\u0930\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u092e\u0941\u0932\u093e\u0915\u093e\u0924 \u0915\u0940 \u0925\u0940\u0964 \u0917\u094c\u0930\u0935 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0927\u093e\u0928 \u0928\u0947 \u0938\u091a\u0947\u0924 \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0925\u093e\u0964 (Pappu\u2019s psycho sister Priyanka met Pak army chief Bajwa on February 7 in Dubai. Gaurav Pradhan had warned us. )\u201d\n\nThe messages hint at a February 7 tweet put out by Twitter user @DrGPradhan where he alleged that Pakistan\u2019s Rawalpindi was planning some \u201cmisadventure\u201d on the Indian side of the Line of Control. He further suggested that the conspiracy was in close coordination between \u201cbottle\u201d and \u201cNomi\u201d.\n\nPradhan has made earlier references to \u201cNomi\u201d, who he claims is the right-hand man of the chief of Pakistan\u2019s Inter-Services Intelligence. The word \u201cbottle\u201d might be a reference to Priyanka Gandhi as claimed by an article shared by Pradhan himself.\n\nThe authenticity of Pradhan\u2019s claims remain questionable as there is no mention of any Nomi or that he is connected to Priyanka Gandhi in the media.\n\nPriyanka Gandhi was in Delhi on February 7\n\nThe viral messages claiming that Priyanka Gandhi met with Pak army chief in Dubai on February 7 do not stand up to the scrutiny of facts. The Congress leader was appointed as AICC general secretary in-charge of the party\u2019s affairs in Uttar Pradesh East on February 6. Gandhi attended her first official meeting in Delhi on February 7 to discuss Lok Sabha poll strategy. The meeting was reported across mainstream media channels.\n\nAfter the Pulwama attack where at least 40 Indian jawans were martyred, misinformation targeting Congress has witnessed a surge. Alt News had earlier reported how a clipped video of Priyanka Gandhi was viral on social media claiming that the Congress leader was laughing after the attack.", "lang": "en"}
