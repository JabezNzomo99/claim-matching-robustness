It is being claimed that the man in the video is a doctor from Sir Ganga Ram hospital in Delhi.\n\nA Facebook user Nitin Jain uploaded the video with a caption in Hindi which translates to: \u201cA doctor from Ganga Ram hospital has given very good information\u201d. The video has been shared by more than 5,300 people at the time of filing this story.\n\nThe archive version of the video can be seen here.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found the claim with the video to be false. The video was made by a TikTok user.\n\nAuthorities at Ganga Ram hospital have said that the video is being falsely attributed to them. The hospital also disassociated itself from any claim made in the viral video.\n\nAlso, there is no study to prove that drinking lots of water or gargling with warm water can kill Covid-19. Though it is true that warm salt water has long been used as a home remedy to soothe a sore throat, but till now, there is no evidence that it can also ward off the novel coronavirus.\n\nAFWA had debunked this claim earlier too.\n\nThe Press Information Bureau (PIB) had also debunked this rumour that coronavirus can be treated by gargling with warm water mixed with salt and vinegar.\n\nWho is the man in the video?\n\nThe viral video also shows a TikTok account @subhashayada. Through this account, we found that the video was made by a TikTok user Subhash A Yadav. However, the video is not available on his account anymore. We tried to contact Subhash via message and his response will be updated in the story once received.", "lang": "en"}
