It concluded that this was 295.9 times higher than the average compensation of workers at those companies, which was a decline from a peak of 383.4-to-1 in 2000 but far higher than a 20-to-1 ratio in 1965.\n\nEPI has published a fairly detailed description of its methodology. For chief executives, it originally used an annual survey published by the Wall Street Journal, and then later switched to buying the information \u2013at a cost of $10,000 a year, according EPI president Lawrence Mishel\u2014from Compustat, a division of Standard & Poor\u2019s. The database includes data on the compensation of the companies in the S&P 1500 Index dating back to 1992, but Mishel says they focus on the top 350 in order to remain consistent with the WSJ data going back to the 1960s.\n\nFor the workers, the compensation calculation is even more complicated. The researchers looked at Bureau of Labor Statistics data for the hourly wages of production and nonsupervisory workers in the industries covered by the companies in the chief executive database. (Generally, these workers represent about 80 percent of payroll employment.) This turned to be about 20 percent higher than median hourly wage.\n\nTo determine annual compensation, including health benefits and like, EPI used a compensation-to-wage ratio from Labor\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis, and multiplied the data by 2,080 (52 weeks x 40 hours.) The result was a calculation that the annual compensation for typical workers in these firms was $55,800, which is likely an overstatement because not all workers work full-time.\n\nMishel says he was trying to be conservative, but it is worth noting that the Wall Street Journal survey for 2013 says the median pay for chief executives at the 300 largest companies was $11.4 million, not EPI\u2019s $15.2 million. Mishel says he does not know why the WSJ calculation is 25 percent lower.\n\nIndeed, Bloomberg last year did its own calculation of the top 250 companies and came up with a ratio of 204 to 1, which it says is an increase of 20 percent since 2009. (EPI\u2019s figures shows a 50 percent increase since 2009.) Bloomberg breaks down the data by individual companies. J.C. Penney, the company with the worst ratio, showed 1,795 to 1. But the companies at the bottom of the list has ratios of about 173 to 1.\n\nThis brings us to Clinton\u2019s statement. The most powerful part of EPI\u2019s research is the change in the ratio over time, as stock options and other incentives have resulted in big increases in chief executive pay. Clinton simply stated \u201cCEOs make 300 times more than the American worker.\u201d But most chief executives do not work at large companies.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics says there are more than 246,000 chief executives in the United States, with a median annual wage of $173,320. Looking just at chief executives of \u201cmanagement of companies and enterprises\u201d yields an annual median wage of just over $216,000. These figures do not include benefits, but on an hourly basis it\u2019s about five or six times more than the pay of a typical worker before benefits.\n\nData published by the Statistic Brain Web site, using information from Forbes and other organizations, also shows that more than 50 percent of chief executives have an annual salary of less than $250,000 and nearly 80 percent make less than $500,000. Just 2 percent have annual salaries that top $3 million. (These figures do not appear to include stock options.)\n\nNow, of course, the earnings by executives at the biggest firms certainly influence pay trends at smaller companies, as well as pay for university presidents, nonprofit executives and so forth. But the story is much more complicated once you get past the companies with the biggest revenue.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank law passed five years ago required publicly traded companies to begin to disclose the pay ratio between their chief executives and workers but the Securities and Exchange Commission has struggled to write the regulation in part because there are so many complicated variables to consider. If the rule is ever issued, then the data set possibly could be even richer.\n\nClinton appeared to be speaking extemporaneously, though a video of the event indicates she was also looking at notes. But she should have been clearer that she was discussing the pay ratio of top corporate chief executives, not all CEOs.\n\nThe EPI study she relied on is most compelling in showing the trend in compensation over time, since it relies on a similar data set dating back to the 1960s. In a given year, the gap may not be as stark as 300-to-1 if you are looking at other studies or individual companies.", "lang": "en"}
