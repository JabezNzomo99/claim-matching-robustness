According to a transcript of his speech posted on the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s website, Shulgin also put forward what he said was documentary evidence of his claim: he said a search of the \u201cgoogle.patents.com\u201d data base using the keyword \u201cNovichok\u201d found \u201cmore than 140 patents granted in the United States related to the use of, and protection from, the impact of the \u2018Novichok\u2019 chemical warfare agent.\u201d\n\nFirst, the correct address of the actual source is \u201cpatents.google.com,\u201d not \u201cgoogle.patents.com.\u201d\n\nSecondly, a search of \u201cpatents.google.com\u201d using the keyword \u201cNovichok\u201d yields 59 results, not 140.\n\nThirdly, among the 59 results, there are no patents for \u201cproducing\u201d or \u201cusing\u201d Novichok. Rather, the results are for such things as the \u201cdetection\u201d and \u201ccomposition\u201d of Novichok series nerve agents, as well as \u201cdetoxification,\u201d \u201cprevention\u201d and treatment of poisoning caused by Novichok series nerve agents.\n\n\u200bAsked to comment on what Shulgin said, Paul Fucito, press secretary of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office told Polygraph.info: \u201cI could not begin to speculate on the claim.\u201d\n\nFucito added: \u201cAfter a thorough search, we cannot find anything to support claims for any patents issued for the production of a combat substance. The term \u2018Novichok\u2019 has appeared, however, in issued U.S. patents for various treatments (including exposure to chemicals/toxins) and the detection of substances.\u201d\n\nAlthough Russia\u2019s OPCW representative referred to the public domain, there are patents and licenses issued in the U.S. under the Executive Order for Classified National Security Information, and those are not accessible in the patents.google.com database to which Shulgin referred in his speech at The Hague.\n\nThe office of Russia\u2019s permanent representative to the OPCW in The Hague, Netherlands, did not respond to Polygraph.info\u2019s request for a copy of the documentary evidence Alexander Shulgin presented at the April 18 meeting.\n\nThe British government has accused the Russian government of using a nerve agent to poison former Russian military intelligence colonel Sergey Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the British city of Salisbury on March 4.\n\nAfter conducting an independent examination of samples from Britain, the OPCW concurred with the findings of the British government\u2019s Porton Down research facility, finding \u201cthe toxic chemical was of high purity.\u201d The OPCW was silent on the source of the poison.\n\nThe incident led to a diplomatic crisis, with about 20 countries, including the United States, expelling Russian diplomats.\n\nRussia denied any connection to the poisoning and during the two months following the incident produced multiple \u201calternative versions\u201d of the incident in Salisbury.\n\nEU Mythbusters, a European Union source for combating Russian disinformation, counted 37 different versions voiced by Russian officials or state media. Alexander Shulgin\u2019s claim is #38.", "lang": "en"}
