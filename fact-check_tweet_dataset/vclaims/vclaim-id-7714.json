How many migrants arrive in the UK and how many children do they have?\n\nThese figures are incorrect, the accurate figures are ten times lower in each case. Mr Woolfe has since corrected his tweet.\n\nAround 775,000 children were born in the UK in 2016\u2014the latest year for which data is available. Of those children, 210,000 were born to mothers not born in the UK, Isle of Man or the Channel Islands.\n\nThat works out at about seven births every five minutes, not 70, of which two were born to mothers not born here, not 20.\n\nIt\u2019s also incorrect to say that every five minutes 60 people migrate to the UK. Again, the figures are around 10 times too high.\n\nAround 580,000 immigrants came to the UK in the year ending September 2017\u2014according to estimates for the latest year figures are available for. That works out at about five and a half every five minutes, not 60.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the total number arriving. The net figure (i.e. the number arriving minus the number leaving) is around 245,000, or two every five minutes.\n\nThe migration figures used here are collected by interviewing people leaving and arriving in the UK at airports, ferry terminals and other routes in and out of the UK. Broadly speaking, if someone plans to come and live in the UK for more than a year they are counted as an immigrant, if they plan to live outside the UK for more than a year, they are counted as an emigrant.\n\nFrom these interviews the Office for National Statistics estimates the level of immigration and emigration to and from the UK, but the figures have a wide margin of error. The ONS says that they are confident the true level of net migration will fall within 42,000 of the reported headline figure of 244,000 (they\u2019re 95% confident the correct figure lies somewhere between 203,000 and 286,000).", "lang": "en"}
