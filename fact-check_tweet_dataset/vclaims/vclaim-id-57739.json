The claim, however, is false; as long as they are worn properly, the commonly used piece of personal protective equipment does not block the path of oxygen, experts say.\n\n\u201cBreathing over and over exhaled air turns into carbon dioxide, which is why we feel dizzy... It causes discomfort, loss of reflexes and conscious thought. It generates great fatigue,\u201d one post says after making the hypoxia claim.\n\nThe claim also appears on Facebook here and on Twitter here, and has been shared in Spanish more than 23,000 times since at least April 30, 2020.\n\nDr. Shelley Payne, director of the LaMontagne Center for Infectious Disease at the University of Texas at Austin, said that correctly worn masks allow the flow of air, and carbon dioxide does not accumulate.\n\n\u201cA properly fitted mask will not cause hypoxia,\u201d she told AFP in an email.\n\nDr. John Criscione, professor of biomedical engineering at Texas A&M University, told AFP by email: \u201cIf someone is experiencing hypoxia then the mask is either too restrictive or they may have an underlying medical condition that makes them less able to accommodate a modest restriction to breathing.\n\n\u201cThe person may need a positive air pressure respirator, a much more complex device with a filter and compressor to make breathing easier.\u201d\n\nClaudio Mendez, health policies professor at the Austral University of Chile, agreed that as long as the mask material permits airflow, wearing it will not cause hypoxia.\n\nIn the case of masks worn by health professionals, he said: \u201cN95 masks should not be worn for more than seven hours. Surgical masks can be used for a shorter time. Both are far from causing hypoxia.\u201d\n\nRegarding the effects of hypoxia on the human body, he added: \u201cIt can result in fainting, disorientation, coordination problems, and changings in cardiac rhythm. It can severely affect the normal physiology of a human being.\u201d\n\nThe Facebook post also asserts that it is \u201ccounterproductive\u201d for people in public for more than eight hours to wear masks because \u201cthey are intoxicating themselves without knowing it.\u201d\n\nAddressing this claim, Mendez reiterated that health workers shouldn\u2019t use masks for more than seven hours, but for reasons unrelated to hypoxia. \u201cA mask doesn\u2019t last more than seven hours because it has already been exposed to the virus for a long time and loses its effectiveness,\u201d he said.\n\nThe post also recommends lifting the mask every 10 minutes to feel \u201chealthy.\u201d\n\nIn the context of the novel coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization actually recommends the opposite -- not touching the mask at all.\n\n\u201cIf you do, clean your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water,\u201d the WHO website reads.\n\nThe WHO does not mention hypoxia as a potential side effect of wearing a mask.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Prevention and Control also does not cite any such risk, although the website says that masks are not recommended for children under two or for anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious or is otherwise incapacitated.\n\nThe claim also surfaced in Africa including in posts here, here and here. Experts there have also largely dismissed the hypoxia risk.\n\n\u201cYou only rebreathe carbon dioxide if you do not have air exchange but this is not the case while wearing a proper mask. Air goes in and out of masks just fine,\u201d Nairobi-based infectious disease specialist Rodney Adam told AFP.\n\nMeanwhile, some experts have cautioned that children under the age of two-years should not wear masks because they can easily choke as they cannot verbalise difficulties in breathing.\n\nKenyan infectious disease epidemiologist Mark Nanyingi also warned that people suffering from chronic respiratory illnesses may exert unnecessary pressure on their lungs while wearing masks.\n\n\u201cA person with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can easily suffer from hypoxia or hypercapnia while wearing face masks for prolonged hours as their lungs are already under pressure and doing so they place themselves at a higher risk,\u201d he told AFP, adding that mask fabric should allow for air circulation and not be tight-fitting.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked more than 430 examples of false or misleading information about the novel coronavirus.
