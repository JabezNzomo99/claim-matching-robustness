No, that's not true: The link in the posts takes viewers to a gorilla giving the middle finger. The post was a hoax related to the coronavirus, but the joke went viral and fooled some people.\n\nThe claim has appeared in several posts (archived here), one of which was published on Facebook by Britney Whitley on March 16, 2020. It opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this:\n\nSeveral similar posts are making the rounds, but they mention different amounts for the payout: $420, $900, while yet another suggests a range of $700-1,000.\n\nMany of the posts use actual television news logos for the image to give the falsehoods an air of authenticity.

On March 17, 2020, the White House announced an $850 million stimulus package, which would also include support for businesses, according to The Washington Post.\n\nAlso, Republican Sen. Mitt Romney has suggested giving each American adult $1,000, to ensure economic stability, according to CNN. However, this is merely a proposal and has not been taken up by Congress.\n\nUntil lawmakers take up those measures, posts such as these are spreading some humor but not the truth.\n\nOther fact checks by Lead Stories concerning coronavirus misinformation include:\n\u2022 Fact Check: Italy Has NOT Mandated No Treatment Of All Elderly With Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: A Banana A Day Does NOT Keep The Coronavirus Away\n\u2022 Fact Check: 15 Minutes In Sauna Will NOT Kill The Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: A Dog Vaccine Can NOT Be Used To Inoculate People Against Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: The CDC Is NOT Warning People The Morel Mushroom Increases Coronavirus Risk By 200%\n\u2022 Fact Check: Baby Formula NOT Necessarily Being Shipped For Free During Coronavirus Outbreak\n\u2022 Fact Check: Train Was NOT Marked With \"COVID-19\" On Its Side\n\u2022 Fact Check: NOT 10,000 Deaths In Virus Outbreak in Michigan, Washington, Idaho, North Dakota, Missouri, Mississippi\n\u2022 Fact Check: CDC Did NOT Recommend Men Shave Their Beards To Protect Against Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: Florida Man NOT Arrested For Robbery Using Cough As A Weapon\n\u2022 Fact Check: Lysol Products Can Kill Older Strains Of Coronavirus, But Tests Have NOT Scientifically Proven They Kill Novel Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: Hair Weaves And Lace Front Wigs Made In China NOT Likely To Contain Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: Scientists Did NOT Discover That Cocaine Kills Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fact Check: NO Evidence Coronavirus Is Bioweapon Leaked From Wuhan Lab\n\u2022 Fake News: Six Coronavirus Cases NOT Confirmed In Wichita, Kansas (Or Several Other U.S. Cities)\n\u2022 Fake News: 20 Million Chinese Did NOT Convert To Islam, And It Was NOT Proven That Coronavirus Epidemic Did Not Afflict Muslims\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Evidence To Support Claim From Bioweapons Expert Who Says Coronavirus Is Biological Warfare Weapon\n\u2022 Fake News: Popping Bubble Wrap Does NOT Expose People To Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fake News: Data From Windy.com Does NOT Show Massive Release Of Sulfur Dioxide Gas Near Wuhan\n\u2022 Fake News: Latest Research Published By Chinese Scientists Did NOT Say Coronavirus Will Render Most Male Patients Infertile\n\u2022 Fake News: NO Proof That High-Rise Buildings Have Become Human Incinerators To Combat Coronavirus\n\u2022 Fake News: Residential Building NOT In Wuhan, NOT Set Ablaze To Control Coronavirus Spread", "lang": "en"}
