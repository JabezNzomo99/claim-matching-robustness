Mueller III. Central to this narrative is a meeting held in the Oval Office on Jan. 5, 2017. Cleveland links to another Federalist article that alleges a series of leaks were engineered after the meeting \u201cto sideline key law enforcement and intelligence officials and cripple the ability of the incoming Trump administration to run the country.\u201d Coincidentally or not, a number of the articles cited were part of The Washington Post\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning entry in national reporting, an accomplishment that Trump\u2019s supporters have long tried to discredit.\n\nAs for the Jan. 5 meeting, a key document cited is an email that then-national security adviser Susan E. Rice sent herself on Jan. 20, 2017. Rice wrote that Obama told participants that \u201cas we engage with the incoming team, we are mindful to ascertain if there is any reason that we cannot share information fully as it relates to Russia.\u201d Obama was aware of intercepts of conversations between Flynn and the Russian ambassador at the time, Sergey Kislyak, concerning sanctions imposed by Obama for Russian interference in the 2016 election. He asked then-FBI Director James B. Comey to inform him if anything changes that would affect the sharing of classified information, Rice\u2019s email said.\n\nAn attorney for Rice said she wrote the email on the advice of White House counsel to create a permanent record of the conversation. \u201cWe were not informed by Director Comey or the Attorney General that there was an active investigation of anybody in the Trump orbit,\u201d Rice told House investigators in an interview made public May 7. \u201cWe would not have asked that question because, in the Obama White House, we maintained scrupulously the firewall between people in the White House and contacts with Justice about potential or actual criminal matters.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
