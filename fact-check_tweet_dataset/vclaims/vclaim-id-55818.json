As the camera shifted focus from Shrivastav on the top floor of the studio to Tripathi on the ground, viewers were told that eight family members associated with Tablighi Jamaat tested positive for coronavirus in Madhya Pradesh\u2019s Khargone.\n\nThe anchors contacted channel correspondent Satyavijay for further details. He blamed Noor Mohammad for spreading the infection to his family and claimed that Mohammad had visited Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi after returning from a foreign trip. He subsequently came back to Khargone where he did not inform local authorities that he showed symptoms for COVID-19, added Satyavijay further stating that Noor Mohammad died on March 28. He also said that Mohammad\u2019s mother passed away. \u201cJamaat is the root of coronavirus cases in Madhya Pradesh,\u201d declared the channel correspondent adding, \u201cHad Noor Mohammad informed on time, he would have perhaps been kept in isolation.\u201d\n\nShrivatsav concurred with Satyavijay\u2019s opinion and termed members of Tablighi Jamaat \u201cshameless\u201d \u2013 a word that was continually flashed on TV screens along with similar words such as \u2018badtameez (ill-mannered)\u2019, \u2018behudi (stupidity)\u2019 and \u2018besharam jamaati (shameless jamaati)\u2019.\n\nANI tweeted on the case on April 8. The news agency quoted Khargone district magistrate Gopal Chandra Dad as saying, \u201cThe attendee and his mother died due to the disease.\u201d\n\nWhile Noor Mohammad indeed visited Nizamuddin Markaz after a foreign trip (South Africa) and later returned to Khargone, he is not dead. Alt News spoke with Mohammad who informed that he and his wife returned to Khargone on March 21 and his entire family was examined by district health officials in their residence on March 24. \u201cI had an on-and-off fever since the day I began travelling back to MP from Delhi. I had informed the health officials about my trip to South Africa which they were already aware of since the local administration had kept a list of all people with a history of foreign travel.\u201d None of the family members was admitted to the hospital at the time since they did not run a fever. \u201cMy fever wasn\u2019t continuous and it used to act up at night. It is possible that my temperature was recorded normal as the health officials had visited during the day,\u201d said Mohammad adding that he was advised home-quarantine.\n\nIt is worthwhile to note that testing strategies have been evolving in the country as the disease is progressing. According to earlier guidelines by the Ministry of Health, testing was mostly limited to symptomatic people with a travel history or close contacts of positive cases. This explains why health officials were more concerned about Mohammad\u2019s trip to South Africa. His visit to Nizamuddin was of little consequence on March 24 when the area was not identified as a hotspot.\n\nOn March 31, reports came pouring in about a cluster of cases from the Tablighi Jamaat event held last month. \u201cI contacted the doctors again and told them that I\u2019m coming down to the hospital with my wife,\u201d said Mohammad. District Magistrate Gopal Chandra Dad also informed Alt News that Mohammad had visited the district hospital on March 31, after the news about Nizamuddin Markaz broke out. This is when the couple\u2019s samples were collected and they were admitted to the hospital.\n\n\u201cTheir results came out on April 4. Noor Mohammad tested positive while his wife tested negative,\u201d informed Mohammad\u2019s nephew Yasir Pathan.\n\nBelow is a circular by the district administration which was issued after Mohammad and another patient from Khargone, Lalit Patidar, was tested positive on April 4. The circular informs that both their residences are epicentres and areas within 3 km radium are to be regarded as containment areas.\n\nOn April 9, Mohammad\u2019s nephew Pathan filed a complaint with Khargone police on Republic Bharat\u2019s misreport that Mohammad had passed away due to the infection on March 28.\n\n\u201cMohammad was transferred to Indore\u2019s MRTB Hospital on April 4 where he was kept till April 11. He was discharged on April 12 after he tested negative twice,\u201d said Pathan who sent us a video recorded by Mohammad from the hospital after he heard that rumours of his death were floating in the media.\n\nDainik Bhaskarhad reported about Mohammad\u2019s discharge on April 13. A video was recorded at the time of his discharge where Mohammad can be heard saying that he has fully recovered.\n\nSeven recovered coronavirus patients were discharged from MRTB Hospital on April 12. Indore Commissioner posted about the recovery and also shared a photograph of the discharged patients. The man in a yellow kurta is Noor Mohammad.\n\nIt is noteworthy that eight members of Mohammad\u2019s family had tested positive for coronavirus. Below is their test result which was released was April 7. Among them is Kharshid Bee, Mohammad\u2019s 70-year-old mother, who passed away on April 4. Pathan said that she suffered a stroke at home. The same was reported by Dainik Bhaskar on April 5. However, DM Gopal Chandra Das said that the local administration is regarding her demise as a coronavirus death since she was tested positive after she passed away.\n\nThe broadcast that should have been\n\nNoor Mohammad has been staying at the Khargone isolation ward since his discharge from MRTB Hospital, Indore. Mohammad told us that he landed in Delhi from South Africa on the morning of March 19. He claimed that he was asked to fill out two forms at Delhi airport which were essentially a questionnaire inquiring about his health. \u201cThe form had questions like \u2018Do you have a fever?\u2019, \u2018Do you have a cough and cold?\u2019 I was perfectly fine at the time so marked \u2018no\u2019 in all places. I wasn\u2019t examined,\u201d he said. When asked if he was advised home isolation at the airport he replied in the negative.\n\nMohammad and his wife left for Madhya Pradesh on March 20. They boarded a night train from Delhi and this was when he first began feeling sick. \u201cI thought that it was perhaps because of the hectic journey. I took a tablet for fever,\u201d Mohammad told us. The couple reached Indore at noon on March 21 and finally arrived at Khargone after a three-hour bus journey.\n\nNone of these essential details was a part of Republic Bharat\u2019s broadcast.\n\nThe channel accused Mohammad of hiding his travel history to Nizamuddin and declared that he died on March 28. This itself is bizarre. Nizamuddin emerged as a coronavirus hotspot only on March 31.\n\nNoor Mohammad\u2019s story was grossly trivialised by Republic Bharat for mass consumption. We use the word \u2018trivialised\u2019 because the case was not given the needed coverage that could have helped local authorities in contact tracing.\n\nAccording to Dainik Bhaskar, Mohammad and his wife were on a religious tour since January. Their trip was planned before coronavirus was declared a crisis by the central government.\n\nEnd January: Mohammad and his wife went to Mumbai to attend a Jamaat meet.\n\nFebruary: The couple left for a religious tour In South Africa for close to 45 days.\n\nMarch 19: Noor Mohammad and his wife travel from South Africa to Delhi.\n\nMarch 20: The couple spend the day in Delhi where they visit Nizamuddin Markaz and board a train to Indore at night. Mohammed informed us that he had started feeling under the weather during the journey.\n\nMarch 21: They reach Indore at noon and take a three-hour bus to Khargone.\n\nMarch 22: Mohammad was experiencing an on-and-off fever. His nephew Yasir Pathan told us that Mohammad also had a slight cough. Mohammad visited a general physician who gave him medicines for fever.\n\nMarch 24: Health officials visited Mohammad\u2019s residence. The entire family\u2019s temperature was checked and none of them had a fever. Mohammad was asked to self-quarantine.\n\nMarch 31: Upon hearing the news of Nizamuddin recognised as a COVID-19 hotspot, Mohammad and his wife visited the district hospital where their samples were collected and they were admitted.\n\nApril 4: Mohammad tested positive for coronavirus while his wife tested negative. Mohammad was transferred to MRTB Hospital, Indore. The same day his mother died of a stroke.\n\nApril 12: Mohammad was discharged from MRTB Hospital after testing negative twice.\n\nApril 13: He has since been quarantined at the Khargon district hospital.\n\nRepublic Bharat\u2019s broadcast was erroneous (to put it lightly) on multiple counts. The channel first claimed that Noor Mohammad died which is obviously untrue because we spoke with him on the phone. It further said that Mohammad concealed his travel history. This too is false. When Mohammad landed at Delhi international airport, he filled out a self-declaration form. Alt News verified the questions in the form as mentioned by Mohammad with copies of the form uploaded online by others. Mohammad was not screened at the airport because he did not show symptoms for coronavirus. After returning to Khargone, Mohammad and his entire family were examined by medical officers on March 24. The officers visited his residence because they were aware of his foreign trip. No one from the family was admitted, including Mohammad\u2019s parents aged 70 plus, as their temperatures were normal. On March 31, when Nizamuddin was identified as a COVID-19 hotspot, Mohammad and his wife went to the district hospital where their samples were collected and they were admitted. None of the other family members was given a test. On April 4, Mohammad tested positive and his wife tested negative. Mohammad was shifted to Indore. His elderly mother passed away the same day. Samples of eight family members, including the mother, were subsequently collected. On April 7, all of them tested positive.\n\nMohammad followed all the required protocol \u2013 self-declaration at the airport, cooperation with medical workers during the home visit and declaration of his visit to the Markaz after it emerged as a hotspot. Who should be truly blamed then?", "lang": "en"}
