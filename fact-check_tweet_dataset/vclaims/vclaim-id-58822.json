Instead, $2.3 billion in tax credits funded jobs in Mexico, Finland and China, the ad claims.\n\n \n\n We checked all three examples \u2014 and found the ad incorrectly describes them all. \n\n \n\n (We've also checked many other exaggerations about the stimulus.)\n\n \n\n Americans for Prosperity, a group dedicated to \"educating citizens about economic policy\" that works closely with tea party activists and has been funded by the conservative Koch family, released the ad April 26, 2012.\n\n \n\n Here\u2019s the string of claims, starting with an image of the president signing a bill:\n\nWashington promised to create American jobs. We passed their stimulus. But that's not what happened. Fact: Billions of taxpayer dollars spent on green energy went to jobs in foreign countries. The Obama administration admitted the truth, that $2.3 billion of tax credits went overseas, while millions of Americans can't find a job. $1.2 billion to a solar company that's building a plant in Mexico. Half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland. And tens of millions of dollars to build traffic lights in China.\n\nSounds like a scandal and an outrage. Is that what happened?\n\nFor this fact-check, we\u2019re focusing on whether \"tax credits\" that \"went overseas\" included \"$1.2 billion to a solar company that's building a plant in Mexico.\" (In other fact-checks, we found the Finland claim False, and the China claim Mostly False.)\n\n \n\n The ad listed two sources for its Mexico claim, the Energy Department and PV Magazine. We tracked those down, then chatted with the companies involved.\n\n \n\n Two programs, two projects\n\n \n\n We\u2019ll start with what\u2019s true: An American solar company, SunPower, was approved for federal stimulus money. It also opened a solar panel plant in Mexico.\n\n \n\n (Or, rather, it moved its Mexican manufacturing from Chihuahua to a building it\u2019s leasing in Mexicali, said company spokeswoman Natalie Wymer.)\n\n \n\n That\u2019s where the claim\u2019s relationship to the truth ends.\n\u2022 The company didn\u2019t get tax credits, but a $1.2 billion loan guarantee. What\u2019s the difference? The Energy Department expects the loan to be paid back \u2014 with interest.\n\u2022 That loan guarantee wasn\u2019t for the Mexico plant \u2014 a separate project with its own funding \u2014 but to build the California Valley Solar Ranch in San Luis Obispo, Calif. Construction on the California project has already started, with the Energy Department projecting 350 construction jobs and 15 permanent ones. Pacific Gas & Electric Co., the state\u2019s largest utility, will ultimately buy the power.\n\u2022 Most of the solar panels for the California project will come from SunPower\u2019s California manufacturing facility in Milpitas, though given the size of the project, they\u2019ll also come from the company\u2019s plants in Mexico and Asia, Wymer said.\n\u2022 SunPower no longer owns the California Valley Solar Ranch project. The solar project \u2014 and the loan guarantee \u2014 belong to New Jersey company NRG Energy. That\u2019s the company that will get the federal loan money, and be responsible for repaying taxpayers.\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n A TV ad from Americans for Prosperity says billions of tax dollars spent on green energy went to jobs in foreign countries. It claims that stimulus bill tax credits went overseas, such as \"$1.2 billion to a solar company that's building a plant in Mexico.\" The ad even cites sources for its claim.\n\n \n\n But those same sources, plus a few phone calls, quickly bring down the ad\u2019s house of cards. Sure, taxpayer money was originally approved for a California solar company that also happened to open a plant in Mexico. But that loan \u2014 not tax credits, as the ad claims \u2014 will go to a New Jersey company for a solar project in California, employing construction workers in the state, using mostly California-built solar panels, to create solar power that\u2019ll be purchased by a California utility.\n\n \n\n That\u2019s a completely different story. The ad strings together alarming-sounding tidbits about actual stimulus projects to create the impression of something else entirely \u2014 in a way that\u2019s ultimately ridiculous. And that earns our lowest rating, Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
