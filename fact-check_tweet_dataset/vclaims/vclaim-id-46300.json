It is.\n\n\u201cLooney Tunes\u201d have found a new home on HBO Max as a series of shorts that will feature much of the same violent shenanigans despite eschewing guns, with Fudd attempting to get that rabbit using other methods. The animated children\u2019s series that originated as a series of short film features in the 1930\u2019s started streaming on the platform on May 27, 2020.\n\nIn an interview with the Times, Peter Browngardt, who also serves as the executive producer of \u201cLooney Tunes Cartoons,\u201d said: \u201cWe\u2019re not doing guns \u2026 But we can do cartoony violence \u2014 TNT, the Acme stuff. All that was kind of grandfathered in.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cLooney Tunes\u201d series is known for its outlandish characters, including Fudd, Yosemite Sam, and Bugs Bunny. Fudd\u2019s mission as a hunter was always to hunt down Bugs with a rifle, but he usually ended up injuring himself in the process.\n\nOn June 12, 2020, Warner Bros. released a clip titled \u201cDynamite Dance\u201d from the series, showing Fudd chasing Bugs around with a scythe.\n\n\u201cLooney Tunes\u201d Story Editor Johnny Ryan said the the series doesn\u2019t always align with the messages kids today receive.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going through this wave of anti-bullying, everybody needs to be friends, everybody needs to get along \u2026 \u2018Looney Tunes\u2019 is pretty much the antithesis of that \u2026 It\u2019s two characters in conflict, sometimes getting pretty violent.\u201d\n\nWhile there will certainly be no shortage of the cartoons\u2019 trademark violence, there won\u2019t be any guns on the HBO Max show, so we rate this claim as \u201cTrue.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
