A Home Office spokesperson told us: \u201cThese claims are totally false\u201d.\n\nThere have been more general reports of people at Dover who\u2019ve been found to have entered the country illegally during the lockdown, and Dover is usually a hotspot on the south coast for this kind of activity, but nothing that links any of this to the seizure or destruction of PPE shipments.", "lang": "en"}
