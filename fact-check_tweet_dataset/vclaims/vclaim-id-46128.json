The claim is false; the Centre for Food Safety in Hong Kong said there is no evidence to suggest that the virus is transmitted through food produce; the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have also separately said there is \"no evidence\" that COVID-19 has been transmitted through food.\n\nThe claim was published on Facebook here on March 24, 2020. It has been shared more than 60 times.\n\nThe post reads: \u201cFrom HK today: \u2018In our laboratory, we found trace amount of the virus on the skin of fruits and vegetables after 12 hrs. of being touched by another customer who was infected.\n\n We recommend our staff to avoid salads. Do not eat the fruits within 48 hrs..of purchase, or pour some boiling water over the fruit before cutting. Berries, apples, cucumbers and tomatoes are the worst because some people eat the skin. (This would explain why the virus is spreading faster in the West than Asia.) Most Asians do not eat salad, and very few eat the skin of any fruit. WE have to assume anything that comes from outside our home within 48 hrs. is infected. Shoes, clothes, our hair, all food....\u2019\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe novel coronavirus has killed at least 72,000 people and infected more than 1.2 million others worldwide as of April 7, according to this report from the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nAn identical claim was also shared on Facebook here, here and here, and on Twitter here and here.\n\nThe claim is false. On March 31, 2020, Hong Kong\u2019s Centre for Food and Safety said on Facebook here that \u201cno evidence has shown people can be infected with the 2019 coronavirus disease from food\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe truth is: So far there\u2019s no evidence suggesting human beings will be infected by novel coronavirus from food. Food safety risk assessment agencies around the world including those of the European Union, Australia and New Zealand, also believe that human beings are unlikely to be infected with 2019 coronavirus disease from food,\u201d the traditional Chinese post reads in English.\n\nThe CDC also said there is \u201cno evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food\u201d in a newsletter published on March 23, 2020. The US Food and Drug Administration, which enforces food safety standards, reiterated the position, saying here that \u201cthere is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with transmission of COVID-19.\u201d\n\nEFSA also said here that there is \u201cno evidence that food is a likely source or route of transmission of the virus.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
