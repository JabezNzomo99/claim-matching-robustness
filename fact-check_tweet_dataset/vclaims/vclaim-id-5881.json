This claim is misleading, as these identifiers are not found on mail-in ballots for the general election, but for primary elections that require prior party registration.\n\nThe claims feed into a narrative echoed by President Donald Trump that mail-in voting, which is expected to nearly double due to the COVID-19 pandemic, will increase ballot interference and voter fraud during the November 3 election ( here ).\n\nThe posts are also circulating amid a debate over a post office bail out, with Postmaster General Louis DeJoy recently suspending cost-cutting measures that have slowed deliveries in recent weeks ( here ).\n\nExamples of the Facebook posts described above can be seen here , here , and here .\n\nThe posts insinuate that the USPS will determine whether a ballot gets delivered based on whether a barcode on its sleeve contains a \u201cD\u201d or an \u201cR.\u201d The image in the posts comes from what appears to be a now-deleted video uploaded in mid-August by a Florida voter named Tina Brown. A repost of the video can be found here .\n\nShowing that her own barcode contains an \u201cR\u201d while her brother\u2019s contains a \u201cD,\u201d she says, \u201cYour vote is supposed to be protected. Nobody\u2019s supposed to know what you\u2019re voting for. But yet, they put \u2018R\u2019 right here and \u2018D\u2019 right here. So, a postal person could see this, if they\u2019re a Democrat, and say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s an \u2018R.\u2019 Let\u2019s toss it.\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to WPTV-TV, an NBC affiliate in West Palm Beach, Florida, Brown is a registered voter in Palm Beach County ( here ).\n\nThe ballots shown in the posts are for the Florida primary, not the general election on November 3. Florida is a closed primary state, meaning that \u201conly voters who are registered members of political parties may vote for respective party candidates or nominees for an office in a primary election including a presidential preference primary election,\u201d according to the Florida Department of State website ( here ).\n\nIn response to Brown\u2019s viral video, The Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections posted a notice ( www.pbcelections.org/ ) stating the following: \u201cConcerns have been raised by certain voters that having the party on the envelope leads to a possibility of postal employees tampering with or not delivering mail of voters with a particular party. It would be a federal crime for any post office employee to tamper with this process. We have received no such reports of anything like this happening.\u201d\n\nThe notice also explains the meaning of states having a \u201cClosed Primary\u201d and says that voters are mailed ballots according to their party affiliation for the primary election. \u201cFor the General Election in November,\u201d on the other hand, \u201cvoters can vote for candidates of any party, so there is only one ballot style in each precinct.\u201d\n\nAccording to Business Insider, Florida will not begin sending out mail-in ballots until September 24 ( here ). More vote by mail information on deadlines for those registered in Florida is visible here .\n\nThe posts circulating on social insinuate that votes would not be confidential in the general election where there are two candidates from two parties. A person\u2019s choice in a mail ballot is intended to be private (see paragraph two under heading \u2018How does mail balloting work?\u2019 here).\n\nReuters recently fact-checked inaccurate claims on voter fraud, visible here and here .\n\nMissing context. These two ballots, with \u201cR\u201d and \u201cD\u201d for party affiliation on the sleeve, were for the primary election in Florida. They are not the ballot style for the November 3 election.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our work to fact-check social media posts here .", "lang": "en"}
