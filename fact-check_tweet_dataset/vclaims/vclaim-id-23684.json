Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Gomathi from TN won gold for India in Asian games wearing two different torn shoes because she can\u2019t buy one and the government is not helping her. Fact: She won the gold medal in the Asian Athletics Championships, not in the Asian Games. She has herself clarified that she wore the torn shoes in the finals because they were her lucky shoes, not because she can\u2019t buy new ones. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nWhen searched for the news on Google, it is found that Gomathi Marimuthu won the gold medal for India in 800 metres in the Asian Athletics Championship 2019, held at Doha. So, it was not at the Asian Games, as claimed in the post. Also, in an interview published in the SPORTSTAR article, she clarified about the recent controversy on her shoes. She said, \u201cI have heard this so many times (the shoe issue). It is not like that. The pair I wore during the race were lucky ones. I am very sentimental about that pair so I used it for the final.\u201d So, it was not that she could not buy a new pair; she wore the torn shoes out of sentiment.\n\nAlso, in an interview given to \u2018THE HINDU\u2019, her mentor Francis Mary also commented on the issue saying, \u201cSince the pair was two years old, she had stitched and used them. There are sentiments attached to it. We have ordered a new pair. It is yet to reach her.\u201d\n\nTo sum it up, in the Asian Athletics Championships Final, Gomathi wore the torn shoes because they were her lucky shoes.", "lang": "en"}
