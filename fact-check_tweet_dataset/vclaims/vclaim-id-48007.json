The essays urged New York voters to support the ratification of the proposed U.S. Constitution, which had been drafted during the 1787 Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia.\n\nHowever, nowhere in any of the Federalist Papers does the statement attributed to the series of 85 essays appear. A search of the Federalist Papers, provided by Project Gutenberg, did not yield any results for the quote. No variations of the expression appear in the essays either.\n\n\u201cDefinitely not in the Federalist [Papers] and not the purpose of the Constitution,\u201d George Washington University law professor Maeva Marcus wrote in an email to the Daily Caller.\n\nR.B. Bernstein, a New York Law School adjunct law professor and the author of \u201cThe Founding Fathers Reconsidered,\u201d told the Caller in an email that it was \u201ccommon sense\u201d that the purpose of the Constitution was to limit the powers of the federal government.\n\n\u201cAfter all, the whole point of the guys who created [the Federalist Papers] was to write an elaborate and learned brief in favor of the Constitution,\u201d Bernstein wrote. \u201cThey would not be talking about limiting the people or the powers of the people; instead, they were talking about the people both empowering their new government and limiting the powers of that government.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
