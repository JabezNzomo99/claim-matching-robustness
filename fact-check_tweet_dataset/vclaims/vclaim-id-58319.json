And our tests are better.\u201d\n\nIn mid-May, Trump abruptly walked out of a press conference when pressed by a reporter to explain why he viewed the subject of COVID-19 testing as a \u201cglobal competition\u201d and placed so much emphasis on the amount of coronavirus tests that have been conducted in the United States compared to other countries. Needless to say, the reporter did not get a direct answer to the question from the president.\n\nBut a quote meme circulated in May 2020 presented Trump as saying that undertaking more coronavirus testing made the U.S. \u201clook bad\u201d by revealing more infections \u2014 even though revealing infections is one of the primary purposes of the testing. According to the meme, Trump lamented that, \u201cMore testing only reveals more infections and therefore increases the numbers. In a way, by doing all this testing we make ourselves look bad\u201d:\n\nThe meme is essentially correct in its gist, although the first sentence in the statement it attributes to Trump appears to be The New York Times\u2018 elaboration of what he meant rather than a literal reproduction of his words:\n\nTrump has expressed a fixation with coronavirus case numbers on multiple occasions. For example, in March 2020, while a Grand Princess cruise ship remained in limbo off the coast of San Francisco after some of its passengers and crew tested positive for the COVID-19 coronavirus disease, Trump indicated his aversion to allowing it to dock and disembark passengers due to the effect that would have on \u201cthe numbers.\u201d NPR reported:\n\n[Trump] said that he would prefer to have all [the passengers] stay on board, because the arrival of more infected people on U.S. soil would raise the country\u2019s case total. \u201cI\u2019d rather have the people stay,\u201d Trump said, while also noting that he left the final decision in the hands of his administration\u2019s coronavirus task force. \u201cI would rather \u2014 because I like the numbers being where they are \u2014 I don\u2019t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn\u2019t our fault,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAnd during an interview with ABC News in May 2020, Trump again suggested that increased testing was in some way a negative because it increased the number of coronavirus cases reported by the U.S. relative to other countries:\n\nTRUMP: [\u2026] Okay, let\u2019s talk about cases. You know why we\u2019re at a million cases? Because we have more testing than anybody else. If we tested as much as these countries down here, okay, who don\u2019t do very much testing at all. Look at Japan: very little testing. They\u2019re at the bottom of the rung. Look at South Korea, it gets so much publicity. The president of South Korea is a friend of mine. President Moon. He called up, he said, \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing with testing is amazing.\u201d If I tested this number of people instead of this number of people, I\u2019d have far fewer \u2014 if I \u2014 see this line? It goes all the way up over 7 million tests. If I tested down here at 1 million tests, I would have a lot fewer cases too. They know \u2014 the news knows it. They said the other day \u2014 In other words, the better I do with testing, the more I get beat up by saying, \u201cbut you have more cases.\u201d I have more cases because I \u2014\n\nAs Washington Post once observed, \u201cTrump\u2019s obsession with numbers has dominated and shaped the administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus, as advisers and public health experts try to placate a leader who largely views the global pandemic through the political lens of how the statistics reflect on his presidency and hopes for reelection.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
