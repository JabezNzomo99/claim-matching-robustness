It says, just to paraphrase: \u2013 \n\n\u201cAnd people stayed at home,\n\nSomeone meditated, someone prayed,\n\nPeople found themselves,\n\nAnd made new choices,\n\nAnd dreamed of new visions,\n\nAnd created new ways of living,\n\nAnd completely healed the earth,\n\nJust as they were healed\u201d\n\nThe poem has been a viral favourite, as it has resonated with the universal mood in the era of COVID-19, especially among WhatsApp groups since about March 2020, which was also when Namibia Fact Check first encountered it on Namibian social media.\n\nHowever, the poem is not from 1819, or even 1919, but was in fact penned in March 2020.\n\nThe poem was written by Wisconsin, USA, retiree Catherine (Kitty) O\u2019Meara, and the full length poem goes as follows:\n\n\u201cAnd the people stayed home.\n\nAnd read books, and listened, and rested,\n\nand exercised, and made art, and played games,\n\nand learned new ways of being, and were still.\n\nAnd listened more deeply.\n\nSome meditated, some prayed, some danced.\n\nSome met their shadows.\n\nAnd the people began to think differently.\n\nAnd the people healed.\n\nAnd, in the absence of people living in ignorant,\n\ndangerous, mindless, and heartless ways,\n\nthe earth began to heal.\n\nAnd when the danger passed, and the people joined together again,\n\nthey grieved their losses, and made new choices, and dreamed new images,\n\nand created new ways to live and heal the earth fully,\n\nas they had been healed.\u201d\n\nFor some other takes on the poem, see here and here.", "lang": "en"}
