Saban was at the front of a large crowd of players who walked from the Mal Moore athletic facility to Foster Auditorium\u2019s schoolhouse door. Senior running back Najee Harris walked next to Saban wearing a T-shirt reading, \u201cDefend Black Lives; racial solidarity against this corrupt system.\u201d Other players walked behind Saban holding a banner reading, \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d The march was also advertised on social media over the weekend by players with the hashtag #BLM.\n\nAs the Black Lives Matter movement has received support from Biden and various other liberal politicians, and condemnation from U.S. President Donald Trump and conservative politicians, Saban\u2019s involvement in this march was interpreted by some on social media as a tacit endorsement of Biden. When purveyors of misinformation started to recirculate this meme, some were ready to believe that it was real.\n\nBut this image does not feature a genuine quote from Saban, nor does it show a genuine image that was shared by the Biden campaign. This meme was created using a still from an advertisement Saban did for Aflac insurance:\n\nIt should also be noted that while Saban did march against racial injustice, he has not officially endorsed Biden for president. As far as we can tell, Saban has not endorsed anyone for president in 2020, and judging by his previous comments, he likely won\u2019t be endorsing anyone soon.\n\nIn 2016, Saban explained why he didn\u2019t endorse a candidate for president:\n\nIf I say I like one person, that means everybody that voted for the other person doesn\u2019t like me. So, why would I do that? I want what\u2019s best for our country. I\u2019m not sure I can figure that out. I want what\u2019s best for people who want to improve the quality of their life. I hope whoever our leader is will do all that he can do to make our country safe and improve the quality of life for a lot of the people we have in our country and I don\u2019t think I am qualified to determine who that should be.", "lang": "en"}
