His teachings, writings and speeches have influenced other social activists, including American civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and former South African President Nelson Mandela.\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that Gandhi ever actually said or wrote the expression attributed to him in the Facebook post. The Daily Caller News Foundation searched for it in the Gandhi Heritage Portal\u2018s 100 volumes of original documents related to the social activist but found no matches.\n\n\u201cI strongly suspect that this quotation \u2026 is not a direct quote from Gandhi\u2019s own speeches or writings,\u201d said Johannes Bakker, a retired University of Guelph professor and Gandhi expert, in an email to the DCNF.\n\nBakker noted that the \u201csentiment is Gandhian,\u201d pointing to a thematically related expression written by Gandhi in a 1913 work.
