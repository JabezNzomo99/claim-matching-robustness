This claim is scientifically untrue.\n\nExample of the claims can be seen here and here and here .\n\nMost claims refer to a version of a now-deleted, widely shared YouTube video of Dr Andrew Kaufman, a \u201cnatural healing consultant\u201d ( here ) in an interview with Spiro Skouras, an online-personality and \u201cindependent researcher\u201d with a popular YouTube channel.\n\nIn the video, Kaufman talks about how a future COVID-19 vaccine would provide a vessel to \u201cinject genes\u201d into humans, first by a procedure known as \u201celectroporation\u201d, in which an electric current \u201ccreate[s] little holes in our cells that allow the DNA to go into our own cells\u201d and then through the insertion of \u201cforeign proteins that supposedly generate immunity\u201d. Kaufman concludes that the vaccine, like the results of biotechnology in agriculture, will make humans \u201cgenetically modified organisms\u201d.\n\nThere are multiple claims in the nearly one hour-long video, which are beyond the scope of this fact check. However, the main claim in these posts on social media that a COVID-19 vaccine will genetically modify humans (described in the headline of the video and by Kaufman) is false. While most headlines don\u2019t mention DNA-based vaccines, Dr Kaufman talks about them in the video.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), a DNA vaccine \u201cinvolves the direct introduction into appropriate tissues of a plasmid containing the DNA sequence encoding the antigen(s) against which an immune response is sought, and relies on the in situ production of the target antigen.\u201d ( here )\n\nThis means that, in contrast to the more widespread \u201cconventional\u201d vaccines ( here ) which use a whole pathogen or fragment, a DNA vaccine involves the injection of a small part of the virus\u2019s genetic code (DNA or RNA) to stimulate immune response in a patient without an infection ( here ).\n\nThis procedure does not create a genetically modified organism, which the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) defines as \u201can organism in which one or more genes (called transgenes) have been introduced into its genetic material from another organism using recombinant DNA technology.\u201d ( here )\n\nMark Lynas, a visiting fellow at Cornell University\u2019s Alliance for Science group, debunked the idea that a DNA vaccine could genetically modify an organism. Lynas told Reuters that no vaccine can genetically modify human DNA.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just a myth, one often spread intentionally by anti-vaccination activists to deliberately generate confusion and mistrust,\u201d he said. \u201cGenetic modification would involve the deliberate insertion of foreign DNA into the nucleus of a human cell, and vaccines simply don\u2019t do that. Vaccines work by training the immune system to recognize a pathogen when it attempts to infect the body - this is mostly done by the injection of viral antigens or weakened live viruses that stimulate an immune response through the production of antibodies.\u201d\n\nLynas added: \u201cThe DNA [in DNA vaccines] does not integrate into the cell nucleus so this isn\u2019t genetic modification - if the cells divide they will only include your natural DNA. But this approach is incredibly promising for COVID because it can be scaled up very quickly, and is very versatile - it is easy to synthetically produce DNA sequences that match the required bits of viral genetic code.\u201d\n\nDr Paul McCray, Professor of Pediatrics, Microbiology, and Internal Medicine at the University of Iowa further explained to Reuters via email how the COVID-19 vaccines being developed would work:\n\n\u201cFor COVID-19, the main protein used to boost the immune system is the spike (S) protein from the virus. This can be given as a vaccine in many different forms: as inactivated (dead) virus, as expressed protein, in a DNA or RNA vector that will make cells make this protein, etc. So the only modification to the host is to stimulate them to make antibodies and T cells that will prevent infection with the virus or kill any infected cells to prevent or reduce disease severity. This is what happens if you get a virus infection naturally, but the vaccine takes the risk of serious disease out of the equation.\u201d\n\nThere are many trials currently underway for a COVID-19 vaccine worldwide, with some exploring the possibility of a DNA vaccine, which may be where this false claim stems from ( here , here ).\n\nWhile there are trials for a DNA vaccine for COVID-19 underway, the method does not involve changing people\u2019s existing DNA. A future COVID-19 vaccine would not make humans \u201cgenetically modified organisms\u201d, as the video claims.\n\nFalse. A future COVID-19 vaccine will not genetically modify humans. DNA vaccines do not integrate the virus\u2019 DNA into the cell nucleus of its recipient but instead inject part of the virus\u2019 DNA/RNA into tissues to stimulate an immune response in the body.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
