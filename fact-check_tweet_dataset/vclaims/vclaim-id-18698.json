We spoke to the Department for Work and Pensions, which told us that it\u2019s not government policy to do this. The Mirror has corrected their headline today to reflect this fact.\n\nState pension age in the UK is currently a little over 65 for both men and women. By October 2020 it will have risen to 66, from 66 to 67 between the years 2026 and 2028, and then from 67 to 68 between 2044 and 2046.", "lang": "en"}
