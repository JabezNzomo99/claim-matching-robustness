The claim is false; the footage was in fact taken from a sexual harassment awareness campaign video in India that circulated online years before the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe eight-second video was published on YouTube here on June 12, 2020. It has been viewed more than 23,000 times.\n\nScreenshot of the misleading post taken on June 19, 2020\n\nThe post's Tagalog-language caption states: \"Frontliner NURSE raped and repeatedly stabbed by a man DEAD ON ARRIVAL / #frontlinernurse #deadonarrival / A lot of evil people now despite the pandemic this man still raped and stabbed someone\".\n\nAlso Read: Misleading Graphics About Dangers Of Long-term Mask Use Viral\n\nThe video briefly shows footage of a man purportedly assaulting a woman before text appears on the screen that reads in part: \"Condolences to the family\".\n\nIdentical videos were also shared alongside a similar claim on YouTube here and on other websites here and here.\n\nA reverse image search on Yandex using video keyframes extracted with InVID-WeVerify, an online verification tool, found the footage was taken from a scripted sexual harassment awareness campaign video that was published in 2017, years before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe original video was posted to YouTube here on March 17, 2017, by The Backchod, a channel \"dedicated to producing entertaining and engaging videos.\"\n\nThe footage in the misleading posts corresponds to the 40-second mark to the 44-second mark in the original video. The Backchod video's caption reads in part: \"The Backchod brings you a hard hitting video on and against molestation inspired by some real life events.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading posts (L) and the video uploaded by the The Backchod (R):\n\nThe Backchod also said its video is a simulation.\n\n\"This was a scripted video made for the social message on the molestation happening all over the world,\" the organisation told AFP in a Facebook message on June 18, 2020.", "lang": "en"}
