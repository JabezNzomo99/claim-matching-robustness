This is incorrect.\n\nThe image shows a medical document which states COVID-19 can be put on a death certificate \u201con clinical balance of probabilities, without testing\u201d (here).\n\nAbove this, there is a screenshot of a social media status that wrongly claims: \u201cFor signing a death certificate a doctor will get \u00a375.00 but if it\u2019s for covid \u00a3120.00.\u201d The post insinuates that doctors will be tempted to register COVID-19 as the cause of death for monetary gain.\n\nA spokesperson for the British Medical Association (BMA) told Reuters that there is no fee for signing a medical certificate of cause of death (MCCD), regardless of diagnosis. This is the case for all patients whether they are treated through the publicly funded British National Health Service (NHS) or through private hospitals.\n\nWhile the NHS provides free at the point of use healthcare, Britons can opt to pay for private treatment (here , here , here ). The BMA confirmed that individuals who opt to have private treatment cannot be specifically charged for the signing of an MCCD.\n\nThere is, however, a charge for cremation forms, which is the paperwork required for a cremation to take place. Unlike death certificates, cremation forms require NHS doctors to make investigations outside their normal NHS duties (here , here).\n\nThe BMA said that the current fee for a cremation certificate is \u00a382, adding that \u201cthis fee does not vary depending on the cause of death\u201d.\n\nPreviously, cremation could only take place if two certificates, one by the GP and one by another doctor, had been signed. However recent coronavirus legislation means the second form is no longer needed, meaning only \u00a382 needs to be paid. (here)\n\nA COVID-19 diagnosis \u201cdoes not alter the charge for death certificates or cremation paperwork in any scenario,\u201d according to the BMA spokesperson. \u201cIt is possible that whoever has made this statement has conflated some out-of-date rules with a misunderstanding of the different forms required after death and with erroneous figures.\u201d\n\nFalse. UK doctors do not charge a fee for signing death certificates, regardless of diagnosis.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
