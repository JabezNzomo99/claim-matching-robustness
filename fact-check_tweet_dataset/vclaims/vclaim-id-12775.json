His term ended in December 2017.\n\nIn an April 12, 2015 statement on his Facebook page, Villegas called on fellow priests to stop \"homily abuse\" which he described as delivering \"long, winding, repetitious, boring, unorganized, unprepared, (and) mumbled\" sermons.\n\n\n\nThe former CBCP president had also encouraged priests to keep \"divisive election politics away from the lectern\" but did not say priests should not \"attack the current administration,\" as The Daily Sentry claims.\n\nThe misleading report resurfaced on Nov. 7, six days after President Rodrigo Duterte earned criticism for calling saints \"stupid\" and Catholics \"drunkards\" as Filipinos marked the Roman Catholic tradition of All Saints' Day on Nov. 1.\n\nThe report could have reached more than 1.9 million people.", "lang": "en"}
