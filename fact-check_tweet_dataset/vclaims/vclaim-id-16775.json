We\u2019ve not been able to find an exact figure for this, but that would suggest over 85% of acute trusts were in deficit at the end of the year.\n\nOf 240 NHS trusts and foundation trusts, 157 were found to be in deficit in 2015/16.\n\nOver the last few years mental health, ambulance, specialist and community trusts haven\u2019t been in deficit, but the King\u2019s Fund, a health think tank, suggests that this has led to a variation in care and service access.\n\nDavid Williams, the Director General of Finance in the Department of Health, told a committee of MPs that in 2015/16 that being an NHS organisation in deficit became the norm.\n\nThe overall deficit of NHS trusts and foundation trusts at the end of the year was \u00a32.45 billion.\n\nThis year trusts are on track to have a lower deficit than they did last year, according to the House of Commons Library.\n\nAround 72% of acute trusts were in deficit and 60% of all trusts by the end of September 2016. The deficit was at \u00a3648 million.\n\nThe aim for 2016/17 is to bring the overall deficit down to \u00a3250 million. NHS Improvement has estimated that this is more likely to be around \u00a3580 million, although other estimates put the figure higher.", "lang": "en"}
