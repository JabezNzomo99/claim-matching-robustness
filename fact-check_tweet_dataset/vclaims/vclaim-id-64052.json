But the WHO said the document did not originate from them and includes \u201ccherry picked\u201d studies. The agency -- like numerous other health bodies -- recommends mask wearing to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\n\u201cDoes the WHO recommend wearing masks in public settings? Simple answer. No,\u201d claims an August 5, 2020 Facebook post featuring an image with the WHO logo and information about scientific studies said to back the assertion.\n\nThe same image was shared more than 540 times from the Facebook page of Robert Foster, a unsuccessful Republican candidate for governor in the US state of Mississippi, with the claim: \u201cYou are being lied to.\u201d\n\nOther Facebook pages and Twitter accounts shared a Canadian website that featured the image with the headline, \u201cWHO Admits No Evidence for Universal Masking, Recommends it anyway.\u201d\n\nThe claim also circulated on Instagram.\n\nHowever, WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris told AFP in an email: \u201cThis is not a WHO document, but whoever has created it has cherry-picked some materials out of context from some WHO documents.\u201d\n\nThe incomplete picture painted by the highlighted studies was also pointed out by Dr Roger Chou, Professor of Medical Informatics and Clinical Epidemiology, at Oregon Health & Science University.\n\n\u201cIt is a lot of cherry-picked evidence and ignores studies looking at filtration effects and diffusion of droplets, as well as ecological studies indicating that masks have been effective,\" Chou said.\n\nThe image makes four claims related to mask wearing which are misleadingly presented.\n\nClaim 1: There is no direct evidence \u201con the effectiveness of universal masking (from studies on COVID-19 and in healthy people in the community).\u201d\n\nThis claim was shared with a citation for the 2012 study \u201cFacemasks, Hand Hygiene, and Influenza among Young Adults: A Randomized Intervention Trial.\u201d\n\nAlthough that study was conducted during the 2007\u20132008 influenza season, and not the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors found that both students wearing face masks, and students who wore face masks and practiced increased hand hygiene, reduced the rate of influenza-like illness.\n\nThey concluded: \u201cThese non-pharmaceutical measures should be recommended in crowded settings at the start of an influenza pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recently pointed to this study, which found that universal mask wearing helped to mitigate the spread of the novel coronavirus in a Missouri hair salon where two hair stylists came into contact with 139 clients before realizing they were symptomatic. No clients were known to become infected.\n\nErin Silverman, Clinical Research Coordinator at the University of Florida College of Medicine, told AFP by email: \u201cThe overwhelming weight of the evidence supports the use of face masks for prevention of airborne and droplet transmission.\u201d\n\nClaim 2: \u201cHealth care workers using cotton cloth masks were at an increased risk of influenza-like illness compared with those who wore medical masks.\u201d\n\nThis claim was shared with a citation for the 2015 study titled \u201cA cluster randomised trial of cloth masks compared with medical masks in healthcare workers.\u201d\n\nThe study did find that the workers wearing only cloth masks had higher rates of infection -- but its authors still affirmed the necessity of protection. They published a special note in light of the COVID-19 pandemic advocating that health care workers only be exposed to patients when adequate respiratory protection is made available.\n\nClaim 3: Wearing a mask may provide the general public a \u201cfalse sense of security, leading to lower adherence to other critical preventative measures.\u201d\n\nThis claim is offered as direct evidence, without a study.\n\nIn June 2020, WHO advice on the use of masks cautioned that one potential risk of universal mask wearing could be \"false sense of security, leading to potentially less adherence to well recognized preventive measures such as physical distancing and hand hygiene.\"\n\nOregon Health & Science University\u2019s Chou, however, pointed to emerging evidence from Germany that \u201cpeople physically distance slightly more when masking is made mandatory.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, researchers in the UK reviewed six studies and found: \"Wearing masks did not reduce the frequency of hand washing or hand sanitising in any of the six studies.\"\n\nClaim 4: \u201cA recent study of 455 individuals showed that asymptomatic people are not causing infectivity.\u201d\n\nThis claim is shared with a citation for a 2020 study titled: \u201cA study on infectivity of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers.\u201d\n\nThe University of Florida\u2019s Silverman and a team of researchers have raised major concerns about the methodology of the study and argued: \u201cThe authors should have taken steps to ensure that their findings not be misconstrued as \u2018proof\u2019 that SARS-CoV2 is poorly, or non-, infective.\u201d\n\nIn an email to AFP she explained: \u201cThe authors acknowledged that their work was limited by the fact it was a single case study, but then they turned around and posed what seemed like a bit of a sweeping statement.\u201d\n\nThe authors of the study did not respond to a request for comment from AFP.\n\nIn a June 2020 review of evidence, Daniel Oran and Eric Topol of the Scripps Research Translational Institute found: \u201cAsymptomatic persons seem to account for approximately 40 percent to 45 percent of SARS-CoV-2 infections, and they can transmit the virus to others for an extended period, perhaps longer than 14 days.\u201d\n\nThe wearing of face masks has been the subject of changing guidance from the WHO since the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in 2019, with initial recommendations focused on reserving medical masks for health care workers and the sick.\n\nOn June 5, 2020, the WHO changed its advice to recommend governments encourage the general public to wear masks.\n\n\u201cIn light of evolving evidence, WHO advises that governments should encourage the general public to wear masks where there is widespread transmission and physical distancing is difficult,\u201d said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\n\nOn July 14, CDC Director Dr Robert Redfield said in a statement: \u201cCloth face coverings are one of the most powerful weapons we have to slow and stop the spread of the virus \u2013 particularly when used universally within a community setting.\u201d\n\nDr Theresa Tam, Canada\u2019s Chief Public Health Officer, has recommended the use of face coverings since May 20, 2020.\n\nSilverman told AFP: \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that so many preventable deaths occurred before mask use was considered by most to be effective, or at least worthwhile.\u201d\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked numerous false and misleading claims about face masks.
