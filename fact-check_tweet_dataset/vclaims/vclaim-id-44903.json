It sparked massive outrage online after a video posted by the owner of the cow with the injured animal, started doing the rounds. A similar incident which led to the death of a pregnant elephant in Kerala had triggered massive outrage across the country last week.\n\nBOOM found that the image of the injured cow is from Rajasthan, where the animal was grievously injured after he strayed into a garbage disposal, where explosives were hidden.\n\nIn several posts, netizens have called out the media for lack of reporting on the incident and misleadingly used the disturbing images of the cow injured in Rajasthan. The images show the cow with a face that has almost been accidentally blown up by explosives.\n\nThe post, originally captioned in Hindi, reads, \"Himachal Pradesh: 4-month-old pregnant cow's face injured using crackers. But this was not newsworthy, nobody's son expressed raged, no animal lover has expressed empathy, because where the incident has happened the placed is ruled by BJP government.\"\n\nClick here to see the post and here for an archived link. An IBTimes article has used the same unverified image with reference to the recent incident from Himachal Pradesh with the headline \"Maneka Gandhi, other BJP leaders face the heat; #JusticeforNandini trends on Twitter\". (archived link)\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search and found Facebook posts from as early as June, 2015, which used several images of the injured animal with the caption which claimed that the incident happened in Lilamba village under Raipur Tehsil, Pali district of Rajasthan. According to the caption of one such post, \"Cow murderers put explosives in the garbage disposal area intentionally to kill the cow in Raipur Tehsil's Lilamba village. The Gau Mata accidentally started eating from the garbage. It was then that a huge blast occurred and villagers came running. Witnesses told that the jaw of the cow had been blown off.\" We then ran relevant keyword searches and found a news report which was published on June 27, 2015 by Patrika. In the image published the injured cow can be seen standing from a different angle.\n\nAccording to the news report, the incident occurred when the cow had strayed into the garbage disposal area of the village. Villagers alleged that miscreants had hidden explosives in the area. It is unclear if the explosives were planted to harm the cattle. An excerpt from the news report reads, \"According to eyewitnesses, the cow was grazing in the garbage disposal area, in front of the Madhyamik School. It is then when the explosion happened. The jaw of the cow was blown off and garbage was strewn all over as a result.\" The report further stated that a similar incident had inflicted injuries to a cow earlier that month. The cow later died. This agitated the villagers, to file a complaint against the miscreants. The owner of the cow, Sohanlal Meghwal, had also filed a complaint with the police regarding the same.\n\nAlso Read: Delhi Public School Selling Face Masks For Rs 400 Each To Students?
