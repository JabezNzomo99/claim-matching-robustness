It carries the URL 'honda.com-cc.com'\n\nThen, users are asked to select their colour of preference, and how they came to know of the message. Finally, the website does \"grant\" a scooter with a promise of delivery in two days on the condition that the message be forwarded to twenty more people on WhatsApp. \n\n\n\nIf the same website is accessed on a desktop, a user is redirected to another shady website 'go6.co'.\n\nBoth these URLs are much unlike the official website of Honda's website, which is honda2wheelersindia.com.\n\nBOOM contacted a spokesperson of Honda, who declined to provide a comment.\n\nThis is the latest the latest in a line of supposed giveaways being made by top brands. Only recently, BOOM has debunked fake promises of free gifts by chocolate-maker Cadbury and Amazon that were circulating in a similar manner on Whatasapp.\n\nAlso Read: Amazon Great India Sale Hijacked By Fake Links On WhatsApp \n\nAnd Is Cadbury Giving Out Free Chocolate Baskets?", "lang": "en"}
