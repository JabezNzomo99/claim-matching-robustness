It does, in fact, show the Vermont senator, then a student at the University of Chicago, getting arrested.\n\n\u201cBernie identified it himself,\u201d senior campaign advisor Tad Devine told the Tribune at the time. \u201cHe looked at it \u2013 he actually has his student ID from the University of Chicago in his wallet \u2013 and he said, \u2018Yes, that indeed is (me).'\u201d\n\nBut the meme\u2019s reason for his arrest \u2013 throwing eggs at black protestors \u2013 doesn\u2019t hold up.\n\nSanders became very involved in social activism during his time at UChicago. He helped organize a sit-in to protest segregated off-campus housing and served as a student leader of the Congress of Racial Equality, a leading civil rights organization in the 1960s. It doesn\u2019t make sense that he would throw eggs at black protestors, given his opposition to the racial discrimination of that era.\n\nSanders got arrested during a civil rights demonstration in August 1963 \u2013 not 1964, as the image claims \u2013 for resisting arrest. He was found guilty, an old Tribune clipping reveals, and fined $25.\n\nAccording to the clipping, 159 protestors were arrested during demonstrations that summer, held to protest the fact that portable classrooms were being used to accommodate students at overcrowded black schools. Protestors argued that the school district should have been sending some of those students to white schools with open seats.", "lang": "en"}
