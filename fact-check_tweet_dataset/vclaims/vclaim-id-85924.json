But I know where you\u2019re going. Now, if you go back 10 years \u2026 it was higher in the past. I\u2019d argue it\u2019s not a very good measure to determine the size of the budget, but it was definitely higher in the past.\u201d\n\nWhen comparing federal budgets over different periods of time, raw numbers can be misleading. So budget analysts often look at spending as a percentage of the overall U.S. economy, or gross domestic product. While not a perfect measure, that figure at least puts the spending in context and helps account for population growth, inflation and other differences.\n\nSo Sen. Graham is on the right track when he wonders about the percentage of GDP. But what about his claim that \u201cit\u2019s been well over 5 percent in times of peace\u201d?\n\nKevin Bishop, Graham\u2019s spokesman, did not respond to queries, so we are not quite sure about Graham\u2019s definition of \u201cpeace.\u201d But let\u2019s look at what the historical tables of the federal budget show (Table 8.4, pages 155-156). These go back to 1962.\n\nExcept for a brief dip between 1977 and 1980, immediately after the end of the Vietnam War, defense spending was above 5 percent of GDP every year between 1962 and 1992. Starting in 1989, defense spending fell from 5.6 percent of GDP to below 4 percent in 1995 \u2014 and even got as low as 3 percent between 1999 and 2001. Then it spiked again after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001, hitting a high of 4.8 percent of GDP in 2010. But it never topped 5 percent.\n\nSo what happened in 1989? The Berlin Wall fell, and the Soviet Union collapsed, marking the end of the Cold War. Under the direction of then-President George H.W. Bush and then-Defense Secretary Richard B. Cheney, military spending was slashed by 25 percent and the active duty force was reduced by 500,000. At the time, it was known as the \u201cpeace dividend.\u201d\n\nSo unless Graham is counting the Cold War as \u201ca time of peace,\u201d we don\u2019t see any period in peacetime when military spending exceeded 5 percent of GDP. In the Ronald Reagan years, for instance, there was no major ground invasion such as in Iraq or Afghanistan, but Reagan\u2019s military buildup was certainly aimed at deterring the Soviets.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s budget, however, does show a sharp decline in defense spending as a percentage of GDP. By 2017, it would dip below 3 percent \u2014 and reach 2.3 percent of GDP in 2024. (See Table S-6.) Over the last half century, defense spending has never been that small compared to the rest of the U.S. economy.\n\nOne could quibble with the definition of \u201cpeace\u201d \u2014 perhaps Graham really believes the Cold War was a time of peace \u2014 but Graham is setting up a bit of straw man here. After the fall of the Soviet Union a quarter century ago, defense spending has not topped 5 percent, even during the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.", "lang": "en"}
