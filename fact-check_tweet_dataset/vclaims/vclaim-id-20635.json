Additionally, data from the energy statistical agency shows that the United States was a net exporter for several years before 1953.\n\nThe White House also cited a March report from the House Committee on Energy and Commerce that said the United States became a net exporter of liquefied natural gas in 2017 \u2014 the first time since 1957.", "lang": "en"}
