The claim is misleading; the Sri Lankan Archeology Department said on February 12, 2020, that while the site is currently undergoing renovations, there were no plans to repurpose the building as a Muslim school; the image in the misleading posts actually shows a church, not the historical structure in cited in the caption.\n\nOne misleading post was published on Facebook here on February 11, 2020. It has been shared more than 13,000 times and has since been deleted.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe Sinhala language text superimposed on the image translates to English as: \u201cLet us stand against the conversion of the Ehelepola Walawwa into a Muslim school. Let\u2019s protect our heritage.\u201d\n\nEhelepola Walawwa is located in Kandy, a major city in central Sri Lanka. It was the ancestral home of a courtier named Ehelepola Disawe during the Kandyan kingdom. The building was used as a prison during the British colonial era and then as a remand facility following independence. In 2013, the building was transferred under the purview of former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa to be restored as a cultural site.\n\nA similar claim about the site being converted into a school has also been shared on Facebook here, here, here and here.\n\nThe claim is misleading; the Central Province Archeology Department told AFP that the site is undergoing renovations, but there were no plans to convert the building to a Muslim school.\n\n\u201cThe site has been named an archeological monument and it is currently undergoing conservation and rehabilitation,\u201d the department\u2019s site officer for Ehelepola Walawwa said by phone on February 12, 2020. \u201cThe Archeology Department supervises the project closely and is on site weekly and can assure you it has not even been suggested that the building be converted to a school.\u201d\n\nThe officer added that the only proposal made in terms of repurposing the building was a plan to convert it to a vegetarian restaurant, but that the proposal was not approved.\n\nThe Kandy Urban Development Authority Director of Projects, Gamunu Premawardana, also refuted the claim.\n\n\u201cIt is false news. The site is undergoing conservation,\u201d he told AFP by phone on February 12, 2020.\n\nThe photog used in the misleading posts does not show the Ehelepola Walawwa. It shows the St. Paul\u2019s Church in Kandy city.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of a Google Street View image of the St. Paul\u2019s Church (L) and the misleading post (R):\n\nThe conservation of Ehelepola Walawwa is part of a Kandy urban development plan being conducted in partnership with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).\n\nHere is a JICA report on the Kandy development plan published in September 2018. The report provides information on the conservation of Ehelepola Walawwa on page 10-19.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the report:\n\nOn page 10-20, the report adds that the Ehelepola Walawwa is being renovated \u201cwithout a clear idea of its future use, but it is considering to turn the place into a local food restaurant and a craft store.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
