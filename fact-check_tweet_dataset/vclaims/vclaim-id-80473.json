The ad, which contained images of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP President Amit Shah and BJP's Chief Ministerial candidate for Karnataka B.S. Yeddyurappa, had the line 'For a Corruption State.'\n\nWhen contacted, Spandana admitted to knowing that the image was photoshopped and that her tweet was meant to be treated as sarcasm.\n\n\"I received it on WhatsApp and I know it is photoshopped. It was meant to be sarcasm as all three of them are corrupt,\" Divya Spandana told BOOM.\n\nThe text in Kannada roughly translates as 'Change the government. Bring in the BJP') Click here to view an archived version of the tweet.\n\nApart from the sentence being grammatically incorrect, the picture when magnified shows clear signs of being edited. Here the word 'free' after the word 'corruption' has been removed thus changing the meaning of the sentence.\n\nBelow is an actual photo of the newspaper's April 17, 2018 edition from Bangalore.", "lang": "en"}
