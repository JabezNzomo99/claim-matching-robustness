The United States said it would expel 60 Russian diplomats, joining governments across Europe.\n\nTwo Russian ambassadors, on at the United Nations and one in Washington, DC accused the U.S. of acting improperly.\n\nIn Washington, Russian Ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov called the U.S. actions \u201cunlawful,\u201d repeating Kremlin\u2019s denial of Russia\u2019s involvement in the poisoning of the ex-GRU spy and his daughter in Britain on March 4.\n\nAnatoly Antonov as a Russian senior diplomat represents one of the 60 countries that are signatories of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.\n\nSigned in April 1961, the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations is an international treaty that sets the rules of diplomatic relations between independent countries. The original \u201cequally authentic\u201d texts of the Convection were presented and signed by all parties in five languages, including Russian.\n\nThe Article 9 of the Vienna Convention reads:\n\n1.\u201cThe receiving State may at any time and without having to explain its decision, notify the sending State that the head of the mission or any member of the diplomatic staff of the mission is persona non grata. In any such case the sending State shall, as appropriate, either recall the person concerned or terminate his functions with the mission.\u201d\n\nThus, Russian Ambassador\u2019s claim that the United States acted \u201cunlawfully\u201d when expelling Russian mission staff does not stand a basic fact-check and is false.\n\nAt the U.N., Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said, Washington has \u201cabused its power\u201d as the host of the UN headquarters when it moved to expel 12 staffers from Russia\u2019s mission at the UN, Russia Today reported on Monday.\n\nThe United States Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley said in statement the expulsions were in \u201caccordance with the 1947 US-UN Headquarters Agreement.\u201d\n\n\"So, contrary to what the Russian ambassador said, the U.S. has acted in accordance with the international laws and regulations,\" the U.N. statement said.\n\nThe U.N.'s statement laid down the conditions under which the U.S. could expel a diplomat.\n\nIn early March, Former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were found unconscious on a park bench in the English town of Salisbury and rushed to the hospital, where they remain in serious condition.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement, announcing the expulsion Monday:\n\n\"The United States takes this action in conjunction with our NATO allies and partners around the world in response to Russia\u2019s use of a military-grade chemical weapon on the soil of the United Kingdom, the latest in its ongoing pattern of destabilizing activities around the world.\"\n\nAntonov also states \u201cthere is not a single bit of evidence\u201d of Russia\u2019s involvement in the Skripal poisoning. Polygraph.info has previously examined and debunked a similar Russian claim. British experts at the Porton Down research facility identified the nerve agent as the one developed on Russian soil in the former Soviet Union.\n\nAnother Russian claim is that \u201cany country with at least some chemistry\u201d could have synthesized Novichok. Given that a scientist who admitted to involvement in Novichok development published formulas for the nerve agent, Polygraph.info found that is possible but that Britain had submitted its findings to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which is conducting an independent evaluation.", "lang": "en"}
