Here\u2019s what they said:\n\nDr. Naveen Dahiya, Ayurveda doctor: There is no study as such which proves that if you put cow ghee in the nose, re-growth of lost hair starts happening.\n\nDr Piyush Juneja, Ayurveda Doctor: \u2018New hair start coming\u2019 is a bit controversial statement. This is not scientifically proven that new hair starts growing on putting cow ghee in the nose. No doubt, cow ghee improves overall health. There is a therapy called Nasya in which the medicine is induced through nasal roots.\n\nWe contacted Dr Harish Bhakuni of National Institute of Ayurveda in Jaipur. He stated: Cow ghee can be helpful sometimes but there are certain do\u2019s and dont\u2019s. If one is having some medical issues, he should never follow any such treatment. It can worsen his medical condition. One should always get complete treatment by consulting a specialist.\n\nWe tried to find similar information on the government of India website. The CENTRAL COUNCIL FOR RESEARCH IN AYURVEDIC SCIENCES, Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India, says \u2013 \u201cWe can maintain a healthy life by simply pouring 2 \u2013 2 drops of cow\u2019s ghee in every nostril daily. It\u2019s called Pratimarshanasya. It may be taken daily whole life. It should be taken after teeth brushing, before going outside and after coming home in the evening etc. This therapy cleanses, purifies and strengthens the nasal passages. When we administrated ghee through the nostrils, it may prevent inhalation of those unwanted particles which enters through nasal passage with polluted air. Nasya also increases our immune power and prevent other diseases also like hair-fall, premature graying of hair, chronic headache, coryza, eye diseases, etc.\n\nAccording to this website, it can help in preventing hair-fall but nowhere it is mentioned that it can help in regrowth of lost hair also.\n\nThe claim about the regrowth of lost hair by putting cow ghee in nostrils is misleading.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right.
