We should have a revolution in this country!\u201d (Nov. 6) \u201cThe phoney [sic] electoral college made a laughing stock out of our nation. The loser one!\u201d (Nov. 6)\n\nAs we said, where you stand depends on where you sit.\n\nWhen Trump thought President Obama had won the electoral college while losing the popular vote, Trump thought the electoral college was a \u201cdisaster for a democracy.\u201d\n\nNow that he himself won the electoral college with narrow wins in three states, while losing the popular vote, Trump thinks it\u2019s a \u201cgenius\u201d system. He\u2019s right that campaign strategies would have been different if the election were determined by the popular-vote margin, but apparently that was not important to him in 2012.", "lang": "en"}
