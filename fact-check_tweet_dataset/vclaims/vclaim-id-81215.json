However, we found that the video is from September 2019 when students, farmers, workers had come together to protest against abrogation of Article 370 in Punjab\u2019s Mohali. The video is being shared with the claim: \u201cNow Punjab demands 370 restoration.\u201d The video shared by Facebook account \u2018Voice of People\u2019 had garnered over nine lakh views and 38,000 shares at the times of publishing the article.

Further, we came across another video on YouTube with caption: \u201cKashmir : Students and farmer come together in Punjab india against Act 370.\u201d This, too, was uploaded in September last year. We noticed that this video carried the logo of \u2018BBC\u2019 on it. Consequently, a search on the YouTube channel of BBC News Punjabi showed the footage of the protest that took place last year. News18 Airs Video From Indore as Flood Situation in Karachi While the BBC video does not have the exact visuals as the viral video, however, we could match several frames and the people seen in both the videos. For instance, the girl seen towards the end of the viral video is the same as the one seen at 0:45 seconds in the BBC video. At 1:02 minutes in the BBC video, the girl wearing a blue top is the same as the one seen in the viral video. Further, two boys can be seen in the viral video sloganeering against the Punjab government. Same people can be seen in the BBC video at 0:41 seconds chanting the same slogans.\n\nNot only are the people seen in both the videos same, even the slogans heard in the two are same as well. Slogans such as \u201cKashmir sangharsh zindabad...punjab sarkar murdabad..punjab police murdabad\u201d can be heard in both the videos. The BBC video mentions that several workers, students and farmers had then come together to protest against the abrogation of Article 370. They had said that they will hold a protest in Punjab\u2019s Mohali on 15 September, however, the \u201cadministration had refused permission for it\u201d. Speaking to The Quint, Kuldeep Singh Chahal, SSP Mohali, too, said the video in question is an old one. Evidently, an old video of people protesting against Article 370 in Punjab has been revived to claim that it\u2019s a recent one.
