A 2004 study for the Justice Department found that the ban\u2019s impact on gun violence was mixed, at best, because of exemptions written in the law; if the ban were renewed, the \u201ceffects on gun violence are likely to be small at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement.\u201d The report said that assault weapons were \u201crarely used\u201d in gun crimes but suggested that if the law remained in place, it might have a bigger impact.\n\nIn 2013, we gave Clinton Three Pinocchios for incorrectly claiming \u201chalf of all mass killings in the United States have occurred since the assault weapons ban expired in 2005, half of all of them in the history of the country.\u201d But here, his claim is a bit more nuanced \u2014 that there was \u201cbig drop\u201d in mass-shooting deaths during the ban, and then deaths rose after it expired.\n\nThe authors, led by Charles DiMaggio, a professor of surgery at New York University\u2019s Langone Medical Center, studied mass-shooting data from 1981 to 2017 that were common to three open-source sets of data. They concluded that assault rifles accounted for 430, or 85.8 percent, of the 501 mass-shooting fatalities reported in 44 incidents but that there were nine fewer mass shooting-related deaths per 10,000 homicides during the federal ban period. Assuming the calculations were correct, the authors said an assault weapons ban would have prevented 314 of the 448, or 70 percent, of the mass-shooting deaths during the years when the ban was not in effect.\n\nThat\u2019s an interesting finding, but the study has been disputed. In a letter published by the journal, Louis Klarevas, a research professor at Teachers College of Columbia University, said the \u201cauthors misidentified the involvement of assault weapons in roughly half of the incidents.\u201d He wrote that \u201cwhen the erroneous cases are recalibrated, the number of incidents involving assault weapons drops 62 percent from 34 to 13, and the number of fatalities resulting from such shootings drops 46 percent from 430 to 232.\u201d He also said one incident did not qualify for inclusion because it involved three shooting deaths, not four.\n\nIn a response that will be published, the authors said: \u201cWe make no claim to have retroactively determined whether these guns would have been illegal under the original statutory language. We question Dr. Klarevas\u2019s claims to be able to do so.\u201d Klarevas told The Fact Checker that he stood by his conclusion that \u201cthey conflate many semiautomatic firearms with assault weapons.\u201d As he put it, \u201cassault weapons are by nature semiautomatic, but semiautomatic firearms are not necessarily assault weapons.\u201d\n\nKlarevas, who defines a gun massacre to be six or more deaths, says his own research for the book \u201cRampage Nation,\u201d however, backs up Clinton\u2019s statement. Compared with the 10-year period before the ban, the number of gun massacres during the ban period fell by 37 percent, and the number of people dying from mass shootings fell by 43 percent. But after the ban lapsed in 2004, the numbers in the next 10-year period shot up again \u2014 a 183 percent increase in mass shootings and a 239 percent increase in deaths.\n\n\u201cI assessed only high-fatality mass shootings when I examined the impact of the federal assault weapons ban. I did not have comprehensive data on mass shootings that resulted in less than 6 killed, which is why my assessment is limited to high-fatality mass shootings,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cMy data-set of high-fatality mass shootings shows that the federal AWB seems to have had an impact in reducing the frequency and lethality of gun massacres.\u201d\n\nAnother expert who has assembled a database on mass shootings is Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections. Duwe also has concerns about the DiMaggio study, in addition to the points raised by Klarevas. He said they did not statistically control for any other rival causal factors that may have influenced mass-shooting deaths, he questioned the statistical technique they selected, and he said it was \u201codd\u201d to restrict the cases to only those appearing in three data sets. His own data set shows there were 95 more cases (139 vs. 44) from 1981 to 2017 and more than twice as many fatalities (1,014 vs. 501).\n\nDuwe provided The Fact Checker with a spreadsheet of mass shootings from 1976 to 2018. Duwe defines a mass public shooting as an incident in which four or more victims are killed publicly with guns within 24 hours \u2014 in the workplace, schools, restaurants and other public places \u2014 excluding shootings in connection with crimes such as robbery, drugs or gangs. (Note that this would exclude a number of \u201cmass murders\u201d that sometimes get lumped into the data, such as the Beltway sniper who killed 10 people over a three-week period in 2002.)\n\nBut beside just looking at raw numbers, Duwe examines trends on a per capita basis, both the incidence and severity (total number of victims) of mass public shootings. Finally, because there are some big fluctuations in the data from year to year, he includes a \u201cmoving average\u201d to help clarify the direction of trends over time. (His spreadsheet included both a three-year and five-year moving average.) For instance, in 1999, the Columbine High School massacre caused a spike in the annual numbers, for a mass public shooting fatality rate of 19.07 per 100 million. A five-year average smooths that out to 7.49.\n\n\u201cWhen we look at the attached data, especially the charts, there\u2019s not strong support for the notion that the per capita incidence was much lower during the late 1990s and early 2000s,\u201d Duwe said. \u201cThere\u2019s more support, however, for the idea that the per capita severity (the rates at which victims were killed or shot in mass public shootings) was lower during this period of time. But what\u2019s even clearer from the data is that there has been an increase in both the incidence and severity of mass public shootings (on a per capita basis) since the latter part of the 2000s.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thing that has changed from my prior writings is that we have accumulating evidence on the effects of lifting the old federal ban,\u201d Koper said. He, along with colleagues, has documented a recent rise in the use of high capacity semiautomatic weaponry across a number of local and national data sources on crime guns. His recent work \u201csuggests that the spread of these types of weapons may have greater impacts on shootings than suggested by my earlier research,\u201d he said.", "lang": "en"}
