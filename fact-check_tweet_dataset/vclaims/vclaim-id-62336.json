The viral posts also identified the woman as a person belonging to the Dalit community.\n\nTherefore, the photograph has been on the internet since 2019 and the incident seen in the photo is not recent. According to the report, a girl was killed in Tursangpura, Sapotra, Rajasthan. Her bound body was found hanging from a tree. Based on this information, a keyword search was done which led to a report by Hindustan Times, published on June 22, 2019. The report identified the woman as Pooja Meena who was 19 years old at that time. The viral posts had claimed that the victim was eight years old.\n\nAccording to the police, the victim was allegedly strangled first and then hung from the tree at the Bapoti village. Her body was discovered when some people passed through the area and saw the body hanging from the tree. She was identified after the police passed the picture of the woman among locals. \"The locals informed us about a body hanging from a tree after which police reached the spot along with a team of forensic experts and collected evidence. Deceased's father has alleged that some unidentified person abducted her, raped her and then killed her,\" Station house officer (SHO) of Sapotara police station Bhanwarlal Boonkar was quoted as saying. \"As per the doctor's report, she was strangled first. Prima facie it appears that in order to misguide the police, the accused hanged the body from the tree so that it looks like suicide. Moreover, the feet of the deceased were touching the ground, which indicates that she was hanged later,\" he added. Reportedly, Mahendra was in a relationship with the woman. The police had arrested him a few days after the incident. He had killed her in order to hide the affair. Therefore, contrary to viral claims, the incident occurred a year ago. The communal claims surrounding the incident are baseless and factually incorrect.
