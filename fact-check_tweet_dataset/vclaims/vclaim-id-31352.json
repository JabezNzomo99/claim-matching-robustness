A recent Facebook post says he\u2019s \"asking everyone to forward this email.\"\n\n\"In three days, most people in the United States will have this message,\" continues the Sept. 25 post. \"This is an idea that should be passed around, regardless of political party. The TRUMP Rules: Congressional Reform Act of 2017 1. No tenure/no pension. A Congressman/woman collects a salary while in office and receives no pay when they\u2019re out of office. And, no more perks go with them.\"\n\nOther rules described in the post include requiring congressional representatives to participate in Social Security, purchase their own retirement plans, and buy health care through the same system as the citizens they represent. They also prohibit Congress from voting to increase representatives\u2019 pay.\n\nThis post, which has been shared more than 75,000 times, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

That year it was supposedly Warren Buffett asking people to forward the email about a proposed constitutional amendment to a minimum of 20 people on their address list.\n\nIn 2011, it was called the \"Congressional Reform Act of 2011\" and it didn\u2019t mention Trump. (FactCheck.org debunked several of the message\u2019s claims back then and revisited the topic again as it resurfaced with the president\u2019s name attached.)\n\nIn 2012, Warren Buffett was at it again!\n\nIn 2018, the message appeared as a petition for the Congressional Reform Act of 2018 posted on ipetitions.com.\n\nAnd now, in 2019, we\u2019re here to say that if you forward this rebooted chain letter, you\u2019ll have seven years of bad luck.\n\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
