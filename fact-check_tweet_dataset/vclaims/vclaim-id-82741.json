For example, it\u2019s true the military budget has decreased under Obama (partly because he pulled troops out of Afghanistan and Iraq) and that Obama has vowed to veto bills that strip federal funds from Planned Parenthood \u2013 but the two points aren\u2019t comparable. The Israel-Iran comparison doesn\u2019t make much sense; virtually no foreign government is off limits for the National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance \u2014 including Israel and Iran \u2014 and security and military ties between Israel and the United States have grown closer than ever during the Obama administration.\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence has released a semiannual report since 2012 on the rate of recidivism. There are two categories in the report: ex-detainees who are \u201cconfirmed of re-engaging\u201d and those \u201csuspected of re-engaging.\u201d \u201cConfirmed\u201d means there is \u201ca preponderance of information which identifies a specific former GTMO detainee as directly involved in terrorist or insurgent activities.\u201d\n\nYes, this has occurred under Obama\u2019s administration. But it\u2019s important to note that 6 percent of all ex-detainees confirmed or suspected of reengaging were released under Obama. The rest were released under Bush. (Five percent of ex-detainees confirmed as returning to terrorism were released under Obama and 7.6 percent were under Bush.) See the data below, from the latest ex-detainee report:\n\nBut in the statements Obama made on the day of the shooting and following days, Obama did not mention gun confiscation. On the day of the shooting, Obama said: \u201cThere are some steps we could take not to eliminate every one of these mass shootings, but to improve the odds that they don\u2019t happen as frequently: common-sense gun safety laws, stronger background checks.\u201d\n\nThe next day, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to, I think, search ourselves as a society to make sure we can take basic steps that would make it harder \u2013 not impossible, but harder \u2013 for individuals to get access to weapons.\u201d (Related: We\u2019ve explored Obama\u2019s inconsistent wording in his responses to mass shootings.)\n\nThere is evidence that Australia\u2019s regulatory changes in response to the 1996 shooting helped reduce gun suicide and homicide deaths, according to a report by the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. However, gun deaths were falling in the early 1990s before the shooting, so there may have been other factors that led to the reduction in deaths, researchers wrote.\n\n[Update: In a Jan. 10, 2016, interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\" Rubio explained he was referring to how Obama\u2019s \u201cproposal for everything is to infringe on the Second Amendment. There\u2019s a terrorist attack in San Bernardino; before even the facts are known, he immediately jumps and says, we need gun control. \u2026 This is what he resorts to.\" When host George Stephanopoulos pressed Rubio further on the claim he made in the campaign ad that Obama had proposed to \u201ctake away our guns,\" Rubio said: \u201cWell, if he could, he would. Obviously he knows he\u2019s constrained by the Second Amendment so what he tries to do is chip away at it every chance he gets. \u2026 He is trying to keep guns out of the hands of law-abiding citizens by continuing to put new restrictions on our gun rights.\"]\n\nRubio said that Guantanamo detainees released under Obama are now \u201cplotting to attack us.\u201d There have been instances of confirmed or suspected reengagement among detainees released under Obama. As of July 5, 2015, there were six ex-detainees confirmed of reengaging and six detainees suspected of reengaging \u2014 out of 196 total ex-detainees who are confirmed or suspected. That means the vast majority (94 percent) of recidivists were those released prior to Obama taking office.", "lang": "en"}
