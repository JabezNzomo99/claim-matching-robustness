Philnetizen.com reports that out of 68,000 votes, 84% answered yes while 16% said no.\n\nThe informal survey does not reflect national sentiment, as philnetizen.com claims in its story, because the demographics of its respondents were not identified. Also, an individual may actually answer the poll more than once.\n\nThe misleading report came a week after the Social Weather Stations released the results of its Dec. 16 to 19 survey, which found 74% of Filipinos were satisfied with Duterte\u2019s performance in 2018. The SWS spoke to 1,440 people around the country, surveying 360 people each from Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao and Metro Manila.\n\nPhilnetizen.com\u2019s misleading story could have reached over two million people, with traffic to the story largely coming from the pages Greco Belgica, PTV ng Bayan and PhilNetizen.\n\n(Editor's Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.
