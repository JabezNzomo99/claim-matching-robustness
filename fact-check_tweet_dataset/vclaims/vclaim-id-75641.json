Som also alleged\u2013wrongly\u2013that Shah Jahan, the Mughal emperor who built the Taj Mahal, had imprisoned his father.\n\nIn reaction, Asaduddin Owaisi, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen chief, asked later that day: \u201cCan [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi and [Uttar Pradesh chief minister] Yogi [Adityanath] tell domestic and foreign tourists not to visit Taj Mahal?\u201d\n\nThe UP government dropped the Taj Mahal, built by Shah Jahan for his wife Mumtaz in 1653, from its list of tourist attractions, the Hindu reported on October 2, 2017.\n\nUP and India earned 49% and 21%, respectively, of their entry fees from protected monuments from the Taj Mahal alone between 2013-14 and 2015-16, according to a reply given to the Rajya Sabha (upper house of Parliament) by Mahesh Sharma, minister of state (independent charge) in the culture ministry, on August 10, 2016.\n\nAbout 23% of foreign travellers to India visited the Taj Mahal, the most visited protected monument in the country in 2014, according to a reply given to the Rajya Sabha by Sharma on December 2, 2015.\n\nBy entry fee earnings, the Taj Mahal has been the top attraction for three years ending 2015-16, earning Rs 22 crore or 22.5% of all earnings from protected monuments in 2013-14, Rs 21 crore or 23% in 2014-15 and Rs 18 crore or 19% in 2015-16.\n\nPoor infrastructure has reduced the popularity of the Taj Mahal with foreign visitors, with their numbers declining 13% to 648,511 in 2014, from 743,256 in 2012, according to a reply to the Rajya Sabha by Sharma on March 16, 2016.\n\n\u201cThe development of Taj Mahal and Agra is among the priorities of the central and state governments,\u201d UP tourism minister Rita Bahuguna Joshi said on October 2, 2017.\n\n\u201cIt is [Som\u2019s] personal remark. BJP disagrees with his comment,\u201d state BJP spokesperson Chandra Mohan said, The Indian Express reported on October 17, 2017. Another spokesperson, G V L Narasimha Rao, said the Mughal rule in India was \u201cbarbaric and a period of incomparable intolerance\u201d.\n\nBoth the chief minister and deputy chief minister of UP have earlier alleged that the Mughal period was not part of Indian culture.\n\n\u201cMughals were not our ancestors, they were actually plunderers. They looted the country. This is not our history,\u201d deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma told Hindi news channel Aaj Tak in an interview on September 12, 2017.\n\n\u201cForeign dignitaries visiting the country used to be gifted replicas of the Taj Mahal and other minarets, which did not reflect Indian culture,\u201d chief minister Adityanath said, The Telegraph reported on June 16, 2017.\n\nThis article first appeared on www.factchecker.in", "lang": "en"}
