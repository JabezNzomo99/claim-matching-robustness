The video \u2013 in which the woman is seen complying with the request \u2013 has provoked outrage, fueling angry rhetoric against BLM, a movement that campaigns against racism towards the African-American community. The alleged author said it was intended as comedy and confirmed he was not a representative of BLM.\n\nExamples of posts featuring the video being taken seriously are visible here , here here , here, and here .\n\nSome tweets commenting on the video read, \u201cDisturbing and disgusting\u201d and \u201cEither this is a set up or the woman is terrified. This is fascism\u2019s darkest re-enactments and not at all a freedom that we all must fight against. I understand that people are angry but this has gone too far.\u201d Others attacked BLM directly, with comments calling them \u201cembarrassing and Insulting to Black people\u201d ( here) or claiming \u201cThis is an example of why \"black lives matter\" will never be successful\" (here ).\n\nThis isolated clip that has gone viral on social media ( here , here ) is part of an almost two-hour video ( bit.ly/2MsgJuw ) posted by a user named Smooth Sanchez. The man filming approaches other passers by and makes similar orders ( bit.ly/2U8LIQI ) . The viral moment is visible at 43 minutes into the video, which was streamed on June 1, 2020.\n\nIn the video, the man filming is heard saying, \u201csince I work for that company, my CEO has told me to come out today and bring you on your knees\u201d.\n\nThe user who posted the video has since confirmed in an Instagram post that he is not part of BLM ( archive.vn/h3dc3 ).\n\nMoreover, BLM is not a company. \u201cBlack Lives Matter Foundation, Inc is a global organization in the US, UK, and Canada\u201d ( bit.ly/373z22H ), its website states. It does not have a \u201cCEO\u201d. Its co-founders, Opal Tometi, Patrisse Cullors, and Alicia Garza started the movement in 2013, after the death of Trayvon Martin. The co-founders recently told the New Yorker BLM \u201chas always been somewhat decentralized\u201d and operates in a horizontal manner: \u201cWe have always said the power goes on in the local chapter because they know what is going on\u201d. ( here )\n\nThe author of the video, who refers to himself as \u201cSmooth S\u00e1nchez\u201d on his social media profiles, has publicly suggested this video was intended as \u201csatire\u201d and \u201ccomedy\u201d, clearly implied in tweets (visible here: archive.vn/65YRy , archive.vn/xqq6A , and archive.vn/xeqmL ). In one tweet ( archive.vn/emQtj ) he writes that \u201cI\u2019m The Creator of This Vid\u201d and, \u201cComedy ..... I Was Trolling\u201d (\u201ctrolling\u201d is a popular term defined by Cambridge Dictionary as \u201cthe act of leaving an insulting message on the internet in order to annoy someone\u201d ( here ). He confirmed to Reuters that he is not a member of BLM, and he was \"just trolling\".\n\nSanchez has posted similar streams of himself \"pranking\" people on the streets, prior to recent protests. These are visible in his YouTube channel ( here ) and include titles like \u201cPublic Prank Trolling IRL [in real life]\u201d and \u201cNYC IRL April fools Live\u201d.\n\nFalse. The man in this video is not a representative of Black Lives Matter.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
