The cash amount that the government spends on schools in England over the next parliament is expected to rise, but the value of that money is expected to fall because of rising prices and rising pupil numbers.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies does predict an 8% cut in school spending\n\nMr Courtney, representing the teachers out on strike today, invoked the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\n\nThe IFS has said that \u201cschool spending per pupil is likely to fall by around 8% in real terms (based on a school specific measure of inflation) between 2014\u201315 and 2019\u201320\u201d.\n\nThere are three parts to this prediction: the actual cash spent; the real value of that money after inflation; and the number of pupils that money goes on. The IFS is looking at all three in combination: spending, adjusted for inflation, per pupil.\n\nBy contrast, the Conservative manifesto committed to protect spending against rising pupil numbers, but not against rising prices.\n\nThe effect of inflation\u2014which the IFS thinks will affect school budgets slightly more than budgets in general\u2014makes this a cut in real terms.\n\nWe haven\u2019t seen a copy of Ms Morgan\u2019s letter, but saying that the school budget will be protected in real terms is also what the government said last November.\n\nWhat\u2019s missing? \u201cPer pupil\u201d. Saying that the budget overall will be protected even after inflation doesn\u2019t actually contradict the IFS, which adds in the per pupil calculation.\n\nPut it another way: imagine your dad promises you \u00a3100 to go to the pub with your friends when you turn 18. That\u2019s not until 2020.\n\nWhat\u2019s your booze budget? You could argue, \u00a3100. Or you could say that \u00a3100 won\u2019t go as far in 2020 because of inflation, so it\u2019s more like \u00a395 in today\u2019s money. And either way, you could say that you need to divide by the number of people in the round to see how far the money goes.\n\nThe size of the budget\n\nSaying that the headline schools budget is \u201cthe highest it\u2019s ever been\u201d ignores the effect of inflation\u2014budgets generally have to keep increasing just to maintain their real value. So while it\u2019s correct that the core schools budget was \u00a340 billion in 2015/16, up from \u00a336.5 billion in 2011/12, that doesn\u2019t necessarily tells us very much about education funding.\n\nBut the IFS can. It shows that real terms spending per pupil has generally risen since the late 1970s, by around 2% per year in the 1980s and 1990s and 5% per year in the 2000s. There was also a small increase under the last government.\n\nA fall of 8%, if it comes to pass, would be the biggest reduction in spending under any parliament as far back as the data goes\u2014as was the case with funding for 16-19 education in the last parliament.", "lang": "en"}
