But the organization said it did not release it, and the flyer\u2019s message contradicts the group's stated beliefs.\n\n\u201cA friend of mine received this in her mailbox, IN MY TOWN!!!! This concerns me. Do you really think BLM is about justice and peace?! Or are they, ALL the people who are using the platform, just spreading hatred? It\u2019s pretty clear what the agenda is... Shame,\u201d a post shared more than 27,000 times on Facebook says, next to a photo of a flyer that includes the Black Lives Matter logo.\n\n\u201cWHITE-men, women, children * You are the enemy,\u201d the text on the flyer says.\n\nSimilar photos circulated on Facebook here, here, and here, on Instagram here and here and on Twitter here, here and here.\n\nBlack Lives Matter has gained increasingly broad support since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody on May 25, 2020, which sparked weeks of rallies across the United States and worldwide. But the group has also been the target of misinformation, including social media posts that seek to undermine its aims and values.\n\nContacted by AFP, the organization denied any involvement in the release of the flyer.\n\n\u201cBLM Global Network did not release any flyer with the \u2018white enemy manifesto\u2019 nor was it posted or shared on any of our social accounts,\u201d Kailee Scales, managing director of the Black Lives Matter Global Network, said by email.\n\nIt \u201cencourages anyone interested in or apart of our movement to seek messaging from trusted and official sources -- such as our BLM Global Network social feeds (@blklivesmatter), our emails, and our official Black Lives Matter website rather than unknown or untrusted sources claiming BLM Global Network's name,\" she added.\n\nThe flyer\u2019s message also contradicts Black Lives Matters\u2019 description of its beliefs.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge, respect, and celebrate differences and commonalities. We work vigorously for freedom and justice for Black people and, by extension, all people,\u201d its website says.\n\nA search on CrowdTangle, a social media monitoring platform, shows that posts with the photo were first shared in early June 2020, but AFP could not determine the originator of the flyer.", "lang": "en"}
