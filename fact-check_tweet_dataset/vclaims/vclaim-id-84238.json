But the claim is false; the bank document in the photo does not show evidence of any such change to the law, the bank said; Pakistani government and tax authorities have said no such tax law amendment has been made.\n\nThis post containing the photo has been shared more than 4,000 times since it was posted on March 26, 2019 by a Facebook page called \u2018Lawyers of Pakistan\u2019, which has more than half a million followers.\n\nIts Urdu-language caption translates to English as: \u201cThe 0.6% deduction which was imposed on withdrawal of more than 50,000 rupees, will now be imposed on 25,000 rupees. Notification issued.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe same image has been shared with similar claims on Facebook here and here.\n\nThe post is accompanied by an image of a bank memo dated March 19, 2019, with its origin listed as \u201cPrincipal Office, Karachi\u201d. Karachi is the largest city in Pakistan.\n\nThe memo references a \u201cFinance Supplementary (Amendment) Act, 2019\u201d and lists section 213AA in a table as \u201cBanking Transactions (against cash), 0.6 per cent, Exceeding Rs. 25,000 per day.\u201d\n\nThe URL listed at the bottom of the document, \u201cbdcprdauthapp.bank.alhabib.com\u201d, does not lead to a bank website, but \u2018Bank Al Habib Limited\u2019 is the genuine name of a Pakistan-based bank. This is its official website.\n\nThe signatory at the bottom of the document is listed as \u201cAshar Hussain, Chief Financial Officer\u201d.\n\nIn a telephone call on May 22, 2019, Hussain told AFP that the document was issued by him but said the Facebook post's caption was misleading as there was no new withholding tax on cash withdrawals exceeding 25,000 rupees.\n\n\"The circular is correct, genuine issued by the bank under my signatures. But the claim in the Facebook post is incorrect and misleading. The taxable cash withdrawal limit has not been reduced from 50,000 rupees to 25,000,\u201d Hussain told AFP.\n\n\"The 0.6 percent withholding tax imposed on the amounts exceeding 25,000 rupees is for getting instruments like bank drafts and pay orders against cash for the non-filers and this was the case before the amendment in the law and still it is the same,\" Hussain said.\n\n\"Non-filers\" refers to people who do not submit annual tax returns.\n\nThe Pakistani State Minister for Revenue Hammad Azhar said in this tweet on March 27, 2019 that the law had not been changed.\n\nHere is a screenshot of Azhar\u2019s tweet:\n\nIn a statement emailed to AFP on March 27, 2019, the Pakistan government\u2019s Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) also stated that it had not revised rates or limits for tax on cash withdrawal from bank accounts under section 231A.\n\n\u201cThe only change which has been made through Finance 2nd Supplementary Act 2019 is taking out the tax filers from the scope of both these provisions. Now these withholding provisions are applicable only to non-filers,\u201d the statement said.\n\nHere is a screenshot of the statement:\n\nThe amendment to the tax law, passed by parliament in March 2019, can be viewed in an online government document here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the amendment on page 51 of the report:", "lang": "en"}
