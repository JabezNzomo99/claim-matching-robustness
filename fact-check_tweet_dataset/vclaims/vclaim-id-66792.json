Tim Kaine tweeted out a geography quiz on a recent visit to Southwestern Virginia.\n\n\"When I stood at Pinnacle Overlook above the Cumberland Gap today, I was closer to 8 other state capitals than to Richmond,\" Kaine on Aug. 20. \"Can you name them?\"\n\nThe Pinnacle Overlook is part of the Cumberland Gap National Historic Park in the Southwest corner of Virginia. Sitting 2,440 feet high, it offers scenic views of three states: Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee.\n\nJon Baliles, the first district city councilman in Richmond, took up Kaine\u2019s challenge and on Twitter rattled off a list of state capitals that are closer to the overlook than Richmond: Frankfort, Ky.; Nashville, Tenn.; Columbus, Ohio; Atlanta; Columbia, S.C.; Indianapolis; Raleigh, N.C.; and Charleston, W.V.\n\n\"Well done! You got them all,\" Kaine wrote.\n\nWe took the quiz, too, and got a different answer.\n\nThere were actually nine state capitals that were closer to where Kaine was standing than Richmond. The senator and the councilman omitted Montgomery, Ala.\n\nWe checked the driving distance between various state capitals and the Cumberland Gap National Historic Park, measuring by the most direct route recommended by Google Maps:\n\nWe also used an \"as the crow flies\" straight line measurement between the Pinnacle Overlook and various state capitals, using . Although the distances changed, the number of closer state capitals did not.\n\nKaine says Pinnacle Overlook in far Southwestern Virginia is closer to eight state capitals than Richmond. Actually, it\u2019s nine.\n\nSo Kaine gets a \"B+\" on his own quiz. On PolitiFact\u2019s grading scale, that translates to Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
