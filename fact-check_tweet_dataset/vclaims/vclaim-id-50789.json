Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nWhen the video in the post was run through \u2018InVid\u2019 plugin, several keyframes were obtained. When these keyframes are subjected to reverse image search, these were found in a video with the title \u2018Pakistan army treatment with Talibans\u2019 and it was uploaded on YouTube in 2012. In the video, at the beginning, a message \u2018This is how Pakistan interrogates innocent Pashtuns without any court or trial\u2019 was displayed and also at the end, a text \u2018Worst has happened to Pashtuns in the tribal areas(Central Pashtunkhwa) however Pakistan and Pakistan army prevented people from documenting it\u2019 was displayed.\n\nWith that information, when searched with keywords \u2018Pakistan army abuse Pashtuns Taliban\u2019, an article of \u2018BBC News\u2019 with the screenshot of that video was found. The article was published on 01 October, 2009. From the article, it can be concluded that the video is related to Pakistan army abusing Taliban suspects in their country. So, the video is no way connected to the Indian army or Muslims in Kashmir.\n\nTo sum it up, an old video of Pakistan Army abusing Taliban suspects is being falsely shared as Indian Army beating Kashmiri Muslims.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Indian Rivers?", "lang": "en"}
