He tried to get Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee for president, to say whether he had talked to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump wouldn\u2019t answer Baier\u2019s question, but he did say \u201cI know Russia well\u201d because \u201cI had a major event in Russia two or three years ago,\u201d referring to the 2013 Miss Universe pageant.\n\nClinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, made the claim about Trump\u2019s foreign-policy experience during a June 6 campaign event in California (at 19:28 in the video).\n\nShe made a similar claim during a June 2 foreign-policy address where she attacked Trump on some of his foreign-policy positions.\n\nIn an email, the Clinton campaign pointed to a May 6 USA Today article with the headline, \u201cTrump Attributes Russia Knowledge To Hosting Miss Universe Pageant There.\u201d\n\nIt would be accurate for Clinton to say, as USA Today did, that Trump said he has knowledge of Russia because he hosted a pageant there. Trump, who sold the Miss Universe Organization to the WME-IMG talent agency in 2015, held the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow.\n\nHowever, Trump didn\u2019t go so far as to say that that was an example of his foreign-policy experience, and Baier never asked him that question.\n\nHere is that part of the interview:\n\nBaier, May 5: About Russia, you were asked yesterday if you\u2019ve ever spoken to Vladimir Putin. And you said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to say.\u2019 Trump: Yes, I have no comment on that. No comment. I was in Russia \u2014 Baier: But one of the things people like about you is to answer any question. Trump: Yes. But I don\u2019t \u2014 let\u2019s assume I did. Perhaps it was personal. You know I don\u2019t want to \u2014 I don\u2019t want to hurt his confidence. But I know Russia well. I had a major event in Russia two or three years ago. Miss Universe contest which was a big, big incredible event, an incredible success. Baier: OK. So we can say you talked to him. Trump: No. I got to meet a lot of people. And you know what? They want to be friendly with the United States. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if we actually got along with somebody?\n\nAt a Republican debate in November, Trump previously said that he knew Putin \u201cvery well\u201d because they were \u201cstablemates\u201d on CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d But as we wrote, Trump and Putin did not appear on the show together because they were interviewed separately \u2014 Trump in the U.S. and Putin in Russia.\n\nThis time, it\u2019s Clinton who is being misleading. She claims that Trump gave an answer to a question that he was never asked.", "lang": "en"}
