This is partly false.\n\nThe image shows a cartoon of Chinese President Xi Jinping kneeling next to rows of coffins, which are draped with flags from all over the world (here).\n\nBelow this the text reads: \u201c1957-1958 \u2013 H2N2 originated in China. 1968-1969 \u2013 H3N2 originated in China. 1997-2004 \u2013 H5N1 originated in China. 2003 \u2013 SARS originated in China. 2006 \u2013 Bird Flu originated in China. 2009 \u2013 Swine Flu originated in China. 2013 \u2013 Porcine Pestivirus originated in China. 2019 \u2013 Covid-19 originated in China.\u201d\n\nThe post is correct to state that COVID-19, the illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in China. It was first detected in December 2019, in the Chinese city of Wuhan ( here )(coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). As of May 19, 2020, at least 318,000 people have died from the disease globally (here).\n\nThe SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was first detected in humans in the Guangdong province of southern China in November, 2002. The epidemic affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 8,000 cases in 2003 (here).\n\nIn 1968 the H3N2 virus, also known as \u2018Hong Kong Flu\u2019, was detected in the then British colony of Hong Kong. While there was a large outbreak in Hong Kong, the World Health Organisation (WHO) says that the origin of the virus is \u201cuncertain\u201d and that it \u201cmay have spread from the mainland of China.\u201d (here)\n\nThe post on social claims there was an outbreak of \u2018H5N1\u2019 between 1997-2004, and an outbreak of \u2018Bird Flu\u2019 in 2006. Listing these separately is misleading as H5N1 is the scientific name for bird flu (avian influenza). The WHO states that the H5N1 virus was first detected in geese in Guangdong in 1996. The first human infection was reported in 1997 in Hong Kong, with outbreaks continuing through 2006 (here) (here).\n\nThere are differing accounts of where the 1957 \u2018Asian flu\u2019 pandemic, which was caused by the virus H2N2, originated from. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that the virus was first reported in Singapore in February 1957, before spreading to Hong Kong in April and the U.S. in the summer (here).\n\nHowever other sources state that the outbreak began in the Guizhou province of southwestern China (here ) (here)\n\nThe post claims there was an outbreak of \u2018Porcine Pestivirus\u2019 in 2013. While it is unclear what this is referring to, there is a pestivirus called Atypical Porcine Pestivirus (APPV) which was detected in Austrian piglets in 2013 (here) (here).\n\nThe 2009 swine flu outbreak did not originate in China - the virus started in Mexico in April 2009. According to the WHO, between 105,000 and 395,000 people are thought to have died from it (here) (here ).\n\nPartly false: While many of the outbreaks listed in the post did originate in China, swine flu started in Mexico and there are differing accounts of where the \u2018Asian flu\u2019 originated from. It is unclear what outbreak the \u2018Porcine Pestivirus\u2019 is referring to.", "lang": "en"}
