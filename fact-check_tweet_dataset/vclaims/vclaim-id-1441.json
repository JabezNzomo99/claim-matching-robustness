The report states that a Russian-made Buk missile launched from a village held by rebels fighting Ukrainian government forces hit the plane. It says a surface-to-air missile system that downed the airliner was driven in from Russia to rebel-held territory in Ukraine and pulled out of the area that same evening.\n\nAfter the investigation findings were made public the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said they cannot accept the findings as satisfactory as they are contrary to the radar data that Russia \u201cconveyed recently.\u201d But it does not say to whom. It seems to imply that the radar data was sent to the investigation team headed by the Dutch Public Prosecutor.\n\nWhen contacted by Polygraph.info on October 7, 2016, the spokesman for the investigation, Wim de Bruin, said \u201cWe have not received this information so far.\u201d The investigative team was not given radar data from the Russians and did not have information from the Russians on Sept. 28, 2016 when investigators issued their findings.", "lang": "en"}
