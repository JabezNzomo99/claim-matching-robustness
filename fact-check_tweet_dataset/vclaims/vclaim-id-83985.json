According to DBPost, they were facilitating ISI by providing crucial information about Indian Army deployments. These men had been clandestinely operating various mediums to send classified information out to their Pakistan handlers. DBPost also reported that three of the detainees were working as handlers for ISI agents and either were running parallel telecom exchanges. We at AltNews.in dug deeper to find more information about at least two of those who have been detained, namely Dhruv Saxena and Mohit Agarwal.\n\nDhruv Saxena, based on his social media profile, is a BJP/BJYM guy and the co-accused Mohit Agarwal is also friends with Dhruv on social media platform Facebook. While Anshul Tiwari, the BJYM President of Bhopal, refuses to acknowledge that Dhruv Saxena held a position in BJYM Bhopal, the now expired bjymbhopal.org website retrieved from Google Cache clearly shows Dhruv as the district coordinator, IT Cell. In fact, the bjymbhopal.org website was made by Dhruv\u2019s company Vocal Heart Infotech and is displayed at the bottom of the website in Google Cache. Dhruv Saxena\u2019s social media profile shows that he\u2019s the Managing Director of Vocal Heart Infotech. Screenshots of the now expired BJYM Bhopal site showing the membership details of Dhruv Saxena and his Facebook work profile can be seen below.\n\nPic taken from his Facebook account.\n\nDruv Saxena also seen with BJP National General Secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya.\n\nOne more Pic with Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chauhan\n\nSo, the above information proves without a shadow of doubt that Dhruv Saxena is involved with BJP and has access to its topmost leaders.\n\n So, Yes, BJP which keeps raising the national-anti-national debate every single day has a ISI operative in their ranks standing shoulder to shoulder with their senior most leaders.", "lang": "en"}
