Tonight we say \u2018Fuck the City\u2019 and we move into the residential areas\u2026 the white hoods\u2026 and we take what\u2019s ours.\u201d (RELATED: Image Claims Barnes & Noble Will Stop Selling Bibles)\n\nThe tweet and subsequent Facebook posts sharing it come amid protests following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. Floyd died after a police officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes, even after Floyd repeatedly said he couldn\u2019t breathe, according to video of the incident.\n\nBut the tweet didn\u2019t come from an antifa account. A spokesperson for Twitter told NBC News that the handle @ANTIFA_US has been linked to the white nationalist group Identity Evropa. The account has since been suspended for violating Twitter rules.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Attorney General William Barr have blamed antifa activists for some of the looting and rioting that has occurred alongside protests, according to The Associated Press. It remains unclear how many of the protesters participating in demonstrations are members of antifa, Reuters reported.\n\nOn May 31, Trump said on Twitter that the U.S. government will designate the group as a terrorist organization.", "lang": "en"}
