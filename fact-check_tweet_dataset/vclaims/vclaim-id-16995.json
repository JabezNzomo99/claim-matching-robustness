That\u2019s accurate. But McCain, the 2008 GOP nominee, bucked the trend of other recent presidential candidates.\n\nIn more than three decades, no other nominees for either party have released fewer than five years\u2019 worth of returns. Romney\u2019s own father released a dozen years\u2019 worth when he ran for the GOP nomination in 1968.\n\nRomney has been under mounting public pressure to release tax returns \u2014 largely due to the Obama campaign raising questions about Swiss bank accounts and investments in the Cayman Islands, a tax haven. Romney has released his tax returns for 2010 and an estimate for 2011 (the full return of which he says he will release later). He says that\u2019s enough.\n\nAsked whether he would release additional tax returns, Romney said in a series of interviews with Pittsburgh news stations on July 17 that he had no interest in providing additional fodder for Obama campaign opposition researchers to pick over and distort. Romney said he would stick to the \u201cprecedent\u201d set by Sen. McCain, who released two years of tax returns in the 2008 presidential race.\n\nRomney on WTAE, ABC, July 17: I\u2019m releasing two years, just as John McCain released two years. Romney on KDKA, CBS, July 18: Well, we\u2019re releasing two years of tax returns, and there are hundreds of pages of documents in those two years. And John McCain also released two years of tax returns. \u2026 We\u2019ve seen the precedent of John McCain. We\u2019re following that precedent. Romney on WPXI, NBC, July 18: I\u2019m releasing two years of returns. It\u2019s the same as John McCain, and that\u2019s a precedent I\u2019m following.\n\nIt\u2019s true that in the 2008 election, Republican nominee McCain released just two years of tax returns. But you have to go back more than 30 years \u2014 to President Ronald Reagan, who released one year\u2019s return in 1980 \u2014 to get to a major party nominee who released less than five years of tax returns.\n\nOver those three decades, the number of years of released tax returns went from a high of 30 by Republican Bob Dole in 1996 to a low of five by Democrat Michael Dukakis in 1988.\n\nIn 1968, when Romney\u2019s father, George Romney, released 12 years of tax returns \u2014 saying, \u201cone year could be a fluke\u201d \u2014 his Republican primary opponent Richard Nixon didn\u2019t release any tax returns. Nor did Democrat Hubert Humphrey.\n\n\u201cThere is no standard,\u201d said Joseph J. Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project at Tax Analysts, a nonprofit, nonpartisan publisher of tax information. \u201cSome candidates have released a lot more returns and others about the same number. It depends on the particular politics at the time and if they are trying to pressure the people they are running against to release more of their returns. Someone will release a lot of returns when they think they have an advantage over their opponent.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, for example, he said, Barack Obama released seven years of tax returns to pressure then-Democratic primary opponent Hillary Clinton to follow suit.\n\nBut while a search for a standard is hopeless, and Romney is not out-of-bounds compared with what others have released, Thorndike said, \u201cHe is a little out of step with the modern trend. In recent years, we\u2019ve seen a lot of returns.\u201d\n\nThe clamor is always louder for wealthy candidates, Thorndike said. And Romney, he said, \u201cis one of the richest candidates we have had in a long time.\u201d The Romney campaign puts Romney\u2019s worth somewhere between $190 million and $250 million (financial disclosure forms put it in the broad range between $85 million and $264 million).\n\nCandidates with wealthy spouses also have been asked to release tax returns. In defense of his decision not to release more tax returns, Romney has been quick to point out that John Kerry\u2019s wife, Teresa Heinz, did not release her tax returns. Romney told KDKA, \u201cActually, John Kerry never released the returns of his wife. And, of course, she has a great fortune.\u201d\n\nHeinz, the widow of John Heinz, heir to the ketchup fortune, eventually released a summary of her 2003 taxes. But unlike the Romneys, Kerry and his independently wealthy wife filed separate tax returns. So Kerry was not legally responsible for what she paid or didn\u2019t pay. John McCain\u2019s wife, Cindy, did the same as Teresa Heinz, releasing a summary of her 2006 returns during the 2008 campaign. We should note that although the Romneys file jointly, the Romneys also released the 2010 returns for individual trusts, as well as for a family trust and a charitable foundation.\n\nCBS News and CNN both did thorough analyses of the history of tax returns released by presidential candidates and their spouses, and the Tax History Project has a detailed database with links to presidential tax returns.\n\nAgain, Romney isn\u2019t wrong about McCain releasing just two years of returns. And Romney may decide to stick to that \u201cprecedent.\u201d But his comments imply that the two years released by McCain is standard, and that he has been unfairly asked to release more than others have in the past. In fact, with the lone exception of McCain, all candidates over the last 30 years each have released more than two years of tax returns.", "lang": "en"}
