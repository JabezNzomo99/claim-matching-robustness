It is a doctored version of a paparazzi photo taken in 2009.\n\nThe image started cropping up on social media in April, around the same time that former Vice President Joe Biden launched his 2020 presidential campaign. It pokes fun at Biden\u2019s ongoing public image issue over his respect for women\u2019s personal space, which has prompted President Donald Trump to nickname him \u201cSleepyCreepy Joe.\u201d\n\nThough the lewd campaign shirt does actually exist, Aniston never wore it. A quick Google image search revealed that the \u201cBiden 2020\u201d logo and hands were superimposed onto a paparazzi photograph. Per the image caption, the photo was taken in 2009 when she was filming an action comedy film called \u201cThe Bounty Hunter\u201d in New York City.\n\nAniston has supported Democratic political candidates in the past, which makes a picture of her poking fun at Biden more dubious. According to Federal Election Commission documents, Aniston donated $36,100 to Hillary Clinton and $30,700 to the Democratic National Committee in 2016. She has also given money to the Obama Victory Fund.\n\nThe \u201cFriends\u201d actress is not the only celebrity whose attire has been photoshopped to further a political message on social media. Chris Evans, star of the \u201cAvengers\u201d franchise, appeared recently in a doctored image on Facebook wearing a t-shirt critical of Republicans.
