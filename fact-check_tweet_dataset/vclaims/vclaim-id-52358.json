However, the images were taken in previous years. A secondary claim that COVID-19 is a bacteria -- and that this therefore would explain the lack of masks in the pictures -- has been refuted by experts.\n\nThe original Facebook post from June 7, 2020, shows pictures of President Cyril Ramaphosa and other politicians gathered together and embracing.\n\n\u201cOn the 6th June 2020 it was totally permissible for President Ramaphosa and over 50 ANC members not to wear a mask at a birthday party,\u201d the caption reads.\n\n\u201cNO social Distancing and they were hugging each other...But the South African public is instructed to wear a mask?????? It really doesn't make sense.\u201d\n\nThat post, shared more than 200 times, was screenshot and republished here on June 8, 2020. By way of an answer, the person who posted it claims: \u201cBecause they know you can't transmit the 'virus', but the bacteria was injected via the flu vaccine... So no, there is no reason to wear a mask, and they know it\u2026\u201d\n\nGatherings are prohibited under level three of South Africa\u2019s lockdown regulations except for places of worship with 50 people or fewer allowed.\n\nA reverse image search on Google shows some of the pictures were shared in a personal tweet by Ramaphosa on June 6, 2020 in a birthday message to political activist Andrew Mlangeni, who turned 95.\n\nMlangeni, an anti-apartheid activist, is the last living defendant of the 1963-1964 Rivonia trial of former president Nelson Mandela and nine others, who faced the country\u2019s erstwhile death penalty on charges of plotting guerrilla warfare and acts of sabotage against South Africa's apartheid regime.\n\nEarlier in the day, the president's office also tweeted some of the pictures from its Twitter account while announcing that Ramaphosa would be delivering a speech via webinar in celebration of Mlangeni.\n\nThe pictures, however, were not recent and predated the novel coronavirus outbreak.\n\nAs verified by Africa Check, two of the images were used by Ramaphosa a year earlier in a tweet from June 6, 2019, again wishing Mlangeni a happy birthday, this time his 94th.\n\nThe remaining two pictures are even older, from Mlangeni\u2019s 93rd birthday party in 2018, as can be seen by the black tie, grey suit and badge he is wearing in this video of the event.\n\nAn Independent Online article on June 6, 2020, shows Mlangeni at home for his latest birthday, wearing a blue sash in the company of United Democratic Movement leader Bantu Holomisa and Johannesburg's mayor, Geoffrey Makhubo. All were wearing face masks in the picture.\n\nThe image was corroborated in an earlier tweet by Holomisa. \u201cIn Soweto on our way to Greet & Drive ceremony in honour of Tata Andrew Mlangeni\u2019s birthday.\u201d\n\nAccording to News24, Mlangeni had a \u201cdrive-through\u201d birthday this year because of national lockdown regulations.\n\n\u201cThe occasion was marked by a \u2018dignified drive-through\u2019 at his home in Dube, Soweto. Each car was given 30 seconds to wish Mlangeni a happy birthday and drop off a present outside the house. The drive-through celebration was led by a fire engine and the mayor's motorcade,\u201d said the article.\n\nThe event was captured in a thread here by the City of Joburg\u2019s Twitter account.\n\nThe claim that COVID-19 is caused by bacteria has been debunked here, here and here by AFP Fact Check.\n\n\u201cBy Jan 7, 2020, Chinese scientists had isolated a novel coronavirus (CoV) from patients in Wuhan,\u201d states this study published in The Lancet, one of the world\u2019s top peer-reviewed scientific journals.\n\nOn February 11, 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) named the new virus \u201csevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\u201d, or SARS-CoV-2, owing to its genetic relation to the coronavirus responsible for the SARS outbreak of 2003.\n\nAs the disease rapidly spread across the world, scientists working independently isolated the new virus. The World Health Organization and national health agencies -- for instance in the United States, the United Kingdom and the Philippines -- all state that the disease is viral.\n\nStudies on COVID-19 patients in countries such as Australia, Italy, Malaysia, Nepal, Korea and France also confirm the disease is not bacterial.", "lang": "en"}
