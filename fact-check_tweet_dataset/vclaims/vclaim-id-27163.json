The accompanying text in Marathi says \u2013 \u201c\u0915\u093e\u0945\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u092e\u093f\u091f\u0940\u0902\u0917\u092e\u0918\u094d\u092f\u0947 \u092a\u093e\u0915\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928 \u091d\u093f\u0902\u0926\u093e\u092c\u093e\u0926,\u092a\u094b\u0932\u0940\u0938\u093e\u0902\u0928\u0940 \u0928\u0947\u0924\u0947 \u0920\u094b\u0915\u0932\u0947,\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0915\u093e\u0901\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938\u0932\u093e \u092e\u0924?\u0909\u0918\u0921\u093e \u0921\u094b\u0933\u0947,\u092c\u0918\u093e \u0928\u093f\u091f\u2026. \u092c\u094b\u0932\u093e \u091c\u092f \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926 (Pakistan Zindabad slogans in Congress meeting, police thrashed politicians. Will you vote for Congress? Open your eyes and look properly. Say Jai Hind.)\u201d All the three videos have been shared with this caption and numbered 1, 2, 3.\n\nThe first video shows Congress workers chanting slogans at an event. From a Facebook page \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0935\u0940\u0930 \u091b\u0924\u094d\u0930\u092a\u0924\u0940 \u0938\u0902\u092d\u093e\u091c\u0940 \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093e\u091c, it received over 18,000 views.\n\nAlt News has debunked this video in the past when it was tweeted by Madhu Kishwar who claimed that \u2018Pakistan Zindabad\u2019 slogans were raised by Congress workers.\n\nThe video had been doing rounds on social media since before the start of the 2018 assembly elections and had already been debunked by multiple media outlets, including BBC Hindi, AFP,The Times of Indiaand India Today.\n\nIf one watches the video carefully, a banner placed on the stage reads \u2013 \u2018Nagar Congress Committee Rajsamand\u2019, and the crowd of Congress workers actually chants \u2013 \u201cMai lai lalkar hai, hamaki sau ke paar hai. Bhati Saab Zindabad (We have accepted the challenge. This time we will score more than 100. Long live Bhati Saab).\u201d\n\nNarayan Singh Bhati was the Congress candidate from Rajsmand, Rajasthan. Alt News has broken down that part of the video where the crowd chanted his name. When heard multiple times over, \u201cBhati Saab Zindabad\u201d is audible more clearly.\n\n\u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0935\u0940\u0930 \u091b\u0924\u094d\u0930\u092a\u0924\u0940 \u0938\u0902\u092d\u093e\u091c\u0940 \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093e\u091c posted a second video with the same caption. It attracted more than 30,000 views. Here, police can be seen coming down heavily upon Congress workers. The Facebook page attempted to justify the police lathi-charge with claims that Congress workers raised \u2018Pakistan Zindabad\u2019 slogans.\n\nIf one carefully watches the video, the banner on the stage reads \u2013 \u201cZilla Congress committee Bilaspur\u201d.\n\nLast year, on September 19, Chhattisgarh police thrashed Congress party workers in Bilaspur.\n\nThe incident was reported across mainstream media channels and none of them said that pro-Pakistan slogans were raised by Congress workers.\n\n\u201cIn a shocking incident, the Chhattisgarh Police on Tuesday brutally thrashed Congress workers in Bilaspur city, leaving seven of them injured. The visuals of the incident show the cops raining blows on the Congress activists, who had returned from carrying out a protest against Urban Administration Minister Amar Agrawal, with lathis,\u201d according to Timesnow.\n\nThe third and last video is the most viral. This too was posted by \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0935\u0940\u0930 \u091b\u0924\u094d\u0930\u092a\u0924\u0940 \u0938\u0902\u092d\u093e\u091c\u0940 \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093e\u091c, among other Facebook pages and individual users (1, 2, 3). In this video too, police can be seen thrashing people claimed to be Congress workers who raised \u2018Pakistan Zindabad\u2019 slogans.\n\nThis incident also pertains to police lathi-charge on Congress workers last year in Bilaspur, where no media reports claim that party members raised \u2018Pakistan Zindabad\u2019 slogans.\n\n\u201cAt least seven Congress workers were injured on Tuesday when police beat them with sticks in Chhattisgarh\u2019s Bilaspur city after they allegedly threw garbage inside a minister\u2019s house. The opposition party claimed its workers were carrying out a peaceful protest against Urban Administration Minister Amar Agrawal but were brutally beaten up by police,\u201d reported The Times of India.\n\nCongress president Rahul Gandhi had taken to Twitter to condemn the police action.\n\n\n\nIn the past as well, Congress has been targeted using misinformation to suggest that the party has a pro-Pakistan position. This includes false claims suggesting that Pakistani flags were raised at Congress rallies or that party president Rahul Gandhi supported the idea of Rs 5,000 crore loan to the country; the accusations are relentless.", "lang": "en"}
