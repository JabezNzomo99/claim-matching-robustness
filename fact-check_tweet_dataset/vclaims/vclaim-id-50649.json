Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nFact: Raghuram Rajan does not have an official Twitter account. The tweet was taken from a parody Twitter account on his name. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nNot only posts on Facebook, but the same news was published by some reputed news agencies like IANS Live (archived version), Caravan Daily (archived version), Pro Kerala (archived version), Outlook India (archived version), The Quint (archived version) and Odisha TV (archived version). It was initially published by IANS on their website. Later, the other agencies published the same on their portals. (Some agencies auto-published the ANI news article). \n\n\n\nWhen searched for the tweet on Twitter, it was found that the same text was tweeted by a parody handle \u2018Raghuram Rajan\u2019 (@RaghuramRRajan). The description of the account reads, \u201cTweets/RTs are Unofficial parody\u201d.\n\n\n\nWhen other tweets went viral on his name three months back, Raghuram Rajan has posted on his LinkedIn account that he does not have accounts on Facebook and Twitter. He wrote, \u2018Any Tweet that is purportedly from me (I understand some are doing the rounds) is fake.\u2019\n\nTo sum it up, Raghuram Rajan has not tweeted on Piyush Goyal\u2019s faux pas. He does not have a Twitter account. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Indian Rivers?", "lang": "en"}
