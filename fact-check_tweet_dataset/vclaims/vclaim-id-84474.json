The Hindu Aikya Vedi\u2019s blog carries a report and photographs from 2010, when the accused Ganeshananda Theerthapada Swami along with the current Kerala BJP Chief Kummanam Rajsekharan and other swamis went to meet the then Chief Minister to submit a memorandum.\n\nThe memorandum demanded the withdrawal of the Government\u2019s order to takeover the administration of ashrams, matt\u2019s and temples in North Kerala. In 2013, he was also the convenor of a spiritual event organised by the Aranmula Paithruka Grama Karmasamithi, an organisation of which the Kerala BJP Chief is the patron.\n\nAccording to the Police, the Swami has been a frequent visitor to the house for the past many years, ever since he came into contact with the family with promises to cure the girl\u2019s father\u2019s illness through prayers and mantra. As per the 23-year old girl\u2019s statement to the Police, the Godman has been sexually assaulting her ever since she was in Class 10.\n\nOn Friday night at 11.30 p.m., he allegedly barged into her room, after everyone else in the home had slept and demanded sexual favours while threatening her with a knife. Later, she managed to get hold of the knife and cut off his genitals. She soon ran out and called up the police control room to inform them of the happenings. The Godman was brought to the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College Hospital with genitals badly damaged.\n\nThe civil society and even the Kerala Chief Minister came out in support of the girl. In television discussions, the Hindu Aikya Vedi leaders distanced themselves from the Godman. The BJP in Kerala tries to create an impression that it is not connected to organisations like Hindu Aikya Vedi, known for a more extreme form of Hindutva. The link between the two organisations became clear recently with the appointment of the new BJP Chief Kummanam Rajasekharan, who was till that point serving as the State General Secretary of the Hindu Aikya Vedi. Rajasekharan also used to be a full-time RSS Pracharak.\n\nA few Hindutva websites even tried to pass off stories claiming that he had stopped being a swami and had become a \u201ccomrade\u201d.\n\nSoon after the incident came to light, old news reports of the Swami\u2019s public appearances and speeches were shared across social media. In one of his speeches, he says,\u201dSpirituality has to be inculcated in children. This should be done not through books, but through spiritual leaders.\u201d\n\nIn one of the speeches made on December 31, 2016, he is quoted as saying that only those who are able to see the \u2018mother\u2019 in every being will be able to achieve salvation.", "lang": "en"}
