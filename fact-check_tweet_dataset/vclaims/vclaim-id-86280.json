The Immigration and Nationality Act bars immigrants seeking admission for the following reasons, all of which are incorporated in H.R. 6: A conviction for \u201ca crime involving moral turpitude,\u201d which could include rape, forgery, robbery, bribery and counterfeiting. Human trafficking, prostitution or money laundering. A violation of any state, federal or foreign law or regulation relating to controlled substances. Convictions for two or more offenses of any kind, if the aggregate sentence was five years or more. If a consular officer or the U.S. attorney general knows or has reason to believe the immigrant has trafficked drugs or assisted drug-traffickers in some way. If a consular officer or the attorney general knows or has reason to believe the immigrant is coming to engage in espionage, corporate espionage, sabotage, an overthrow of the government or \u201cany other unlawful activity.\u201d If U.S. officials know or have reason to believe the immigrant has terrorist ties.\n\n\u201cIf we had wanted to prevent the Department of Homeland Security from using or referring to gang databases, we would have said so,\u201d Lofgren said on the House floor. \u201cThe bill would clearly state that DHS could not use, rely on, or refer to gang databases. That is not what the bill says. The bill says \u2018it shall not establish disqualifying gang participation.\u2019 It can be evidence, but it can\u2019t be the establishment of that fact.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cNow, why would that be the case? We value our law enforcement community. They keep us safe. They are hard-working. But these databases are populated by people way beyond law enforcement, people in school police, school security. They can result in people being mistakenly tagged as gang members when they are not. I will give an example. There was an audit done of California\u2019s gang database, CalGang. When the auditors went through, they found out there were 42 individuals who were under the age of 1 year old who had allegedly self-reported that they were part of a gang. Obviously, that was incorrect. So we would not want to make that the determining factor.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf gang members have evaded criminal conviction or have only two misdemeanor convictions, the law compels officials to grant them green cards unless two things occur,\u201d the GOP aide said. \u201cFirst, the DHS secretary must personally review a gang member\u2019s file and then deny the gang member legal status. Second, the federal court, relying on the administrative record, must also agree with that denial. Because H.R. 6 grants the secretary the responsibility of making exceptions to the green card mandate \u2018as a matter of non-delegable discretion,\u2019 the secretary alone \u2014 without delegating authority to staff \u2014 must review and rule on any case in which a gang member remains eligible for a green card under this legislation. A gang member with a DUI and misdemeanor firearms conviction, for instance, would remain eligible for a green card under H.R. 6, and only personal action by the DHS secretary \u2014 not members of DHS staff \u2014 could deny that criminal a green card.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
