According to the story\u2019s headline, the women were victims of sexual assault who were \u201capologizing\u201d to migrants from Muslim countries for their \u201cdepraved behavior and clothing\u201d that \u201cforced\u201d the migrants to commit acts of sexual assault. The story appeared on numerous Russian-language media sites, including Novye Izvestia, Panorama, E-News, and Russian social media sites like Odnoklassniki. The text of the headline and article appears to be the same on all the sites, although some shortened the story by omitting several paragraphs. The article was frequently accompanied by a photo of a European girl holding a sign that says \u201cSorry Mustafa.\u201d\n\nThe first problem with the story is that the photo has been doctored: it was actually taken in October 2014, of a girl participating in a Ukrainian awareness-raising action called #ZahriyHeroya (Warm a hero), which was aimed at calling attention to the condition of Ukrainian soldiers at the front during winter. Photos show other Ukrainians holding the same sign as the girl, which actually reads: \u201cCold? Think about those who are sleeping in the trenches.\u201d\n\nAs for the #sorry flashmob, searches of Twitter and Instagram turned up nothing like what was described in the article. Moreover, the article does not substantiate a quote from the event\u2019s supposed organizer, identified as \u201cBritta Borg.\u201d Google searches reveal nothing about the action or \u201cBritta Borg,\u201d although Brita Borg was a Swedish pop singer who died in 2010.\n\nSome versions of the article included a story taken from The Daily Mail, about a Norwegian man who purportedly felt \u201cguilty\u201d over the deportation of a Somali man who had sexually assaulted him in 2011. This story had nothing to do with the alleged \u201cflashmob\u201d cited in the February 3 article\u2019s headline and text. Nor did the Norwegian rape victim apologize to his rapist. Rather, he was reacting to hearing that his attacker was set to be deported after serving four and a half years in prison.\n\n\u201cI felt relief and happiness that he would be gone forever,\u201d The Daily Mail quoted the victim, Karsten Nordal Hauken, as saying. \u201cI felt like the Norwegian State had taken responsibility to carry out the ultimate revenge, like an angry father confronting it's child's attacker. But I also had a strong feeling of guilt and responsibility. I was the reason that he would not be in Norway anymore, but rather sent to a dark uncertain future in Somalia.\u201d\n\nRussian media has often spread stories about Muslim migrants sexually assaulting European women with impunity. Such stories often are either highly distorted or, in some cases, completely fabricated. One example of the latter was the story of Liza, a 13-year-old Russian girl living in Germany, who was allegedly raped by a Muslim migrant. Not only did this story appear on major Russian state news outlets, but it was repeated as true by representatives of Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry. The girl confessed that she had made up the story to explain her absence from home.\n\nEven Russian President Vladimir Putin was duped by his own state media\u2019s claims about migrants in Europe. In November 2016, Putin referenced a case in Austria, where a court allegedly acquitted a Middle Eastern refugee for sexually assaulting a boy in a public pool. Putin said the court had set the refugee free because he supposedly could not understand that the boy was saying no. This mirrored a claim made by Russia\u2019s state-owned Channel One a few days earlier. In fact, the immigrant was not acquitted and was in state custody at the time.", "lang": "en"}
