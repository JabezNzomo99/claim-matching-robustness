But he didn\u2019t express an opinion in one interview on whether the U.S. should invade Iraq. And the other came more than a year after the war had started.\n\u2022 Trump blamed President Obama for saying, \u201chere\u2019s our time, here\u2019s our date\u201d for the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, but that date had been set by an agreement signed by President George W. Bush.\n\u2022 Trump wrongly said that one of the San Bernardino shooters \u201cvery openly\u201d supported jihad online. The FBI said the messages on jihad that it found were private messages \u2014 not public postings.\n\u2022 Trump again claimed with no evidence that a neighbor of the San Bernardino shooters \u201csaw \u2026 bombs on the floor\u201d of their home but didn\u2019t report it because of racial profiling concerns. One neighbor reportedly saw the couple receiving several packages and doing work in their garage.\n\u2022 Trump said \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s plan\u201d would allow 620,000 refugees from around the world to resettle in the U.S. during a first term as president. But Clinton didn\u2019t say that. The number comes from a Republican-led subcommittee that made assumptions about what Clinton would do as president.\n\nStill No Evidence for Iraq War Claim\n\nTrump misrepresented a TV interview he gave in January 2003 to claim that he opposed the Iraq War \u201cfrom the beginning.\u201d In that interview, Trump said polling showed the economy is a \u201cmuch bigger problem\u201d for President Bush than Iraq, but he expressed no opinion on whether the U.S. should invade.\n\nAs we have written before, Trump on numerous occasions has made the claim without providing evidence that he was opposed to the Iraq War before it started. In this speech, he claims to have the evidence \u2014 but he doesn\u2019t have the goods. Instead, he cherry-picks his quotes to twist the facts.\n\nTrump did not tell Cavuto that \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t be doing it yet and that the economy is a much bigger problem.\u201d Trump is conflating two separate statements and presenting them as a single sentence and thought.\n\nA little background: The Jan. 28, 2003, interview with Cavuto on Fox Business was conducted prior to President Bush\u2019s State of the Union address that would be delivered that night. Cavuto starts by asking Trump what advice he would give the president on how much time to devote to Iraq and how much to the economy. Trump said the American public is \u201cmuch more focused now on the economy,\u201d and he criticized the Bush administration for dragging out the decision on whether to invade Iraq.\n\n\u201cEither you attack or you don\u2019t attack,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump softened his criticism when Cavuto asked Trump if what he was saying was that Bush\u2019s indecision \u201ccould ultimately hurt us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps [we] shouldn\u2019t be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know,\u201d Trump responds. \u201cHe\u2019s under a lot of pressure. He\u2019s \u2014 I think he\u2019s doing a very good job.\u201d\n\nTrump switched to defending the administration and presented the alternative argument that the invasion should have the support of the United Nations. He didn\u2019t say the U.S. shouldn\u2019t invade Iraq.\n\nTrump then went on to say, \u201cBut, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned.\u201d\n\nOnce again, Trump didn\u2019t say the U.S. shouldn\u2019t invade Iraq. He said public opinion polls show the economy is a \u201cmuch bigger problem\u201d for Bush.\n\nBelow is a fuller exchange with Cavuto. We marked in bold the passages that Trump highlighted in his speech. They are not part of the same sentence, or even the same thought.\n\nCavuto, Jan. 28, 2003: If you had to sort of breakdown for the president, if you were advising him, how much time do you commit [in the State of the Union] to Iraq versus how much time you commit to the economy, what would you say? Trump: Well, I\u2019m starting to think that people are much more focused now on the economy. They are getting a little bit tired of hearing, we\u2019re going in, we\u2019re not going in, the \u2014 you know, whatever happened to the days of the Douglas MacArthur. He would go and attack. He wouldn\u2019t talk. We have to \u2014 you know, it\u2019s sort like either do it or don\u2019t do it. When I watch Dan Rather explaining how we are going to be attacking, where we\u2019re going to attack, what routes we\u2019re taking, what kind of planes we\u2019re using, how to stop them, how to stop us, it is a little bit disconcerting. I\u2019ve never seen this, where newscasters are telling you how \u2014 telling the enemy how we\u2019re going about it, we have just found out this and that. It is ridiculous. Cavuto: Well, the problem right there. Trump: Either you attack or you don\u2019t attack. Cavuto: The problem there, Donald, is you\u2019re watching Dan Rather. Maybe you should just be watching Fox. Trump: Well, no, I watch Dan Rather, but not necessarily fondly. But I happened to see it the other night. And I must tell you it was rather amazing as they were explaining the different \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it is fact or if it is fiction, but the concept of a newscaster talking about the routes is \u2014 just seems ridiculous. So the point is either you do it or you don\u2019t do it, or you \u2014 but I just \u2014 or if you don\u2019t do it, just don\u2019t talk about it. When you do it, you start talking about it. Cavuto: So you\u2019re saying the leash on this is getting kind of short here, that the president has got to do something presumably sooner rather than later and stringing this along could ultimately hurt us. Trump: Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps [we] shouldn\u2019t be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know. He\u2019s under a lot of pressure. He\u2019s \u2014 I think he\u2019s doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned.\n\nTrump also offered as evidence an interview with Esquire that ran in the August 2004 edition \u2014 17 months after the Iraq War started. As we have written, Trump was an early critic of the war after it started, but we can find no clear evidence that he was opposed to it before it started.\n\nTrump blamed President Obama for setting a date for the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, but that date had been set by an agreement signed by President George W. Bush.\n\nAs we recently explained, some have argued that Obama could have done more to renegotiate the Status of Forces Agreement signed by Bush in 2008. But Trump blames the wrong president for, in his words, saying, \u201chere\u2019s our time, here\u2019s our date.\u201d\n\nBush signed the SOFA on Dec. 14, 2008. It said: \u201cAll the United States Forces shall withdraw from all Iraqi territory no later than December 31, 2011.\u201d Then Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice wrote in a book published in 2011 that Bush didn\u2019t want to set a deadline and wanted an agreement for a residual force \u2014 but Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki objected. Bush reluctantly signed the agreement.\n\nObama had three years to renegotiate, and, indeed, Obama sought to leave a residual force of 5,000 to 10,000 troops. But Maliki wouldn\u2019t agree to shield U.S. troops from criminal prosecution by Iraqi authorities, and the negotiations ended in October 2011 over that issue.\n\nThen Defense Secretary Leon Panetta later wrote in his 2014 book that Obama didn\u2019t press hard enough for a deal. But some experts say Maliki wasn\u2019t going to agree to a residual force. Iraq was more closely aligned with Iran at that point.\n\nMaliki \u201cwanted the Americans out of there \u2014 and the Iranians wanted the same thing,\u201d Princeton University professor Bernard Haykel, who heads the university\u2019s Institute for Transregional Study of the Contemporary Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia, told us. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was a deal to be had \u2014 not one in which the Americans would have had immunity.\u201d\n\nAs for Clinton \u2014 who was secretary of state at the time \u2014 she publicly supported Obama. In 2014, she blamed the Iraqi government for not coming to an agreement to protect American troops. In a recent interview with the Washington Post\u2018s Fact Checker, Joby Warrick, a Post reporter and author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book \u201cBlack Flags: The Rise of ISIS,\u201d said that \u201c[w]ithin the administration, Clinton was one of the loudest forces for keeping a residual force in Iraq.\u201d\n\nAnd as for Trump\u2019s views on leaving Iraq, he strongly supported withdrawing in March 2007, telling CNN. \u201cYou know how they get out? They get out. That\u2019s how they get out. Declare victory and leave, because I\u2019ll tell you, this country is just going to get further bogged down.\u201d\n\nTrump cited two bogus examples to back up his point that \u201cwarning signs were totally ignored\u201d in recent terrorist shootings.\n\u2022 He claimed one of the San Bernardino shooters \u201cvery openly\u201d supported jihad online. It was incorrectly reported that the shooter had posted public messages supporting jihad on social media, but the FBI later clarified that those were private messages.\n\u2022 Trump wrongly claimed that \u201ca neighbor [of the San Bernardino shooters] saw suspicious behavior \u2014 bombs on the floor and other things \u2013 but didn\u2019t warn authorities because they said they didn\u2019t want to be accused of racial profiling.\u201d The neighbor in question only reportedly saw the couple receiving a large number of packages, and observed that they were working a lot in their garage.\n\nStop us if you\u2019ve heard these before, because we have written about these claims several times. But it bears repeating: Neither of these claims has been substantiated.\n\nHere\u2019s what Trump said in his Aug. 15 speech on \u201cUnderstanding The Threat: Radical Islam And The Age Of Terror.\u201d\n\nWe wrote about the first claim back in March when then Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz claimed that the woman involved in the San Bernardino, California, shooting had \u201cpublicly posted on social media calls to jihad.\u201d\n\nThe Dec. 2, 2015, shooting in San Bernardino that left 14 dead was carried out by Syed Rizwan Farook, who was born in the United States, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, who came to the U.S. from Pakistan in July 2014 on a K-1 fiancee visa. Farook and Malik were killed in a police shootout.\n\nSupport material for Trump\u2019s speech provided by his campaign links to two articles, one by CNN and the other in the Los Angeles Times, both on Dec. 14. Both stories cited unnamed law enforcement officials saying that the woman sent messages advocating jihad on social media, but both noted the messages were private and written under a pseudonym.\n\nThe New York Times \u2014 which wrote on Dec. 12 that Malik had \u201ctalked openly on social media about her views on violent jihad\u201d \u2014 later added an editor\u2019s note explaining that that wasn\u2019t correct, and that FBI Director James B. Comey said on Dec. 16, 2015, that the online communication the FBI had found from late 2013 between the two San Bernardino shooters was in \u201cprivate, direct messages, not social media messages.\u201d\n\nComey went on to say: \u201cSo far in this investigation we have found no evidence of the posting on social media by either of them at that period of time and thereafter reflecting their commitment to jihad or to martyrdom.\u201d\n\nThe Times\u2019 public editor, Margaret Sullivan, wrote about the Times\u2019 \u201cfaulty\u201d original report, which relied on anonymous sources. Sullivan quoted Executive Editor Dean Baquet as saying, \u201cThis was a really big mistake.\u201d\n\nSullivan wrote that Comey\u2019s statements, in addition to further reporting by the Times, found \u201cMs. Malik had not posted \u2018openly\u2019 on social media. She had written emails; she had written private messages, not visible to the public; and she had written on a dating site. \u2026 In other words, the story\u2019s clear implication that those who vetted Ms. Malik\u2019s visa had missed the boat \u2013 a clearly visible ocean liner \u2013 was based on a false premise.\u201d\n\nTrump was also off-base with his claim that \u201ca neighbor saw suspicious behavior \u2014 bombs on the floor and other things \u2013 but didn\u2019t warn authorities because they said they didn\u2019t want to be accused of racial profiling.\u201d\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s repeated claims, there is no evidence that any neighbor saw \u201cbombs on the floor\u201d of the San Bernardino shooters\u2019 home but declined to report it because of racial profiling concerns.\n\nAuthorities did find what the Los Angeles Times described as \u201can armory of weapons and explosives \u2026 including a dozen pipe bombs and thousands of rounds of ammunition\u201d in the Redlands home of the couple responsible for the shooting rampage. But there is no evidence so far that any neighbors knew about that cache of explosives.\n\nOn Dec. 3, 2015, Los Angeles\u2019 KTLA 5 aired an interview with a man, Aaron Elswick, who is a friend of one of the neighbors. Elswick said the neighbor told him she noticed, \u201cThey were receiving quite a number of packages and they were also working a lot in their garage.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it sounds like she didn\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d Elswick said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to do any kind of racial profiling.\u201d\n\nOn the day of the shooting on Dec. 2, 2015, CBS Los Angeles also aired an interview with a \u201cman who worked in the neighborhood the past three months\u201d who \u201csaid he noticed unusual activity.\u201d But the extent of the \u201cunusual activity\u201d reported by the man \u2014 who was not identified in the news report \u2014 was that he noticed six well-dressed \u201cMiddle Eastern guys\u201d walk from the home to a nearby lunch spot on several occasions. The man said he and his co-workers wondered, \u201cWhat are those guys doing in this neighborhood?\u201d\n\nNeither of those reported cases includes someone who saw the inside of the home, let alone \u201cbombs on the floor,\u201d as Trump claims.\n\nTrump, citing a Senate subcommittee report, said that \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s plan\u201d would allow 620,000 refugees to resettle in the U.S. during her first term as president. But Clinton didn\u2019t say that\u2019s how many refugees she would allow into the country. The Republican-led subcommittee made assumptions about what Clinton would do as president.\n\nLast year, Clinton proposed that the U.S. accept 65,000 refugees from Syria. That was 55,000 more than the 10,000 President Obama authorized for admission from that country for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30. In all, Obama authorized the admission of 85,000 refugees from all nations in fiscal 2016, and Secretary of State John Kerry has said that the administration would aim to admit at least 100,000 global refugees in fiscal 2017.\n\nTo get to 620,000 refugees, the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and The National Interest assumed that Clinton would do something she has not explicitly said that she would \u2014 allow 155,000 refugees into the U.S. each year during her first term as president.\n\nSo, it\u2019s not \u201cClinton\u2019s plan\u201d to admit 620,000 refugees as president. The subcommittee assumed she wanted to do that, even though Clinton has not specified a figure for all refugees over four years.\n\nTrump went on to say that the Republican subcommittee \u201cestimates her plan would impose a lifetime cost of roughly $400 billion when you include the costs of health care, welfare, housing, schooling, and all other entitlement benefits that are excluded from the State Department\u2019s placement figures.\u201d So, that \u201clifetime\u201d estimate is also based on an assumption about the number of admitted refugees that Clinton has not yet addressed. It relies on other assumptions as well, such as that most of the refugees would be low-skilled workers.", "lang": "en"}
