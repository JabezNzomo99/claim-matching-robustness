Trump announced this week that incoming First Lady Melania Trump and his son Barron would not be moving into the White House when he is sworn-in next January. Today he announced that his daughter Ivanka would be \u201ctaking on some of Melania\u2019s key positions\u201d and one of them would include moving into the White House to \u201cfill Melania\u2019s vacancy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a really natural fit, first of all,\u201d Trump explained to the press pool covering him, \u201cand second of all, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a downgrade in hotness at all. Look at my daughter. Isn\u2019t she friggin\u2019 gorgeous? I think she is. I think she\u2019s so gorgeous that sometimes I just can\u2019t help myself and I, you know, want to Access Hollywood her, if you know what I mean? Of course you do. Everyone knows what I mean because I have this great brain here.\u201d\n\nIt is true that Melania Trump is not immediately expected to move to the White House from New York City. However, the portion about Ivanka Trump taking Melania\u2019s place at any point was fabricated.\n\nAlthough NC Scooper\u2018s humor is typically fairly obvious, the claim about Ivanka Trump was not the first that readers mistook for real news. Previous articles shared as legitimate news included claims that five million uncounted Bernie Sanders ballots were found on Hillary Clinton\u2019s e-mail server (and that Sanders had called for \u201cchemtrail reform\u201c), that Meg White was selected as the new drummer for the band Rush, that Merle Haggard left his entire estate to a LGBT group, that roving gun confiscation vans had been spotted in California, and that the Clintons surreptitiously purchased a mansion in the Maldives.", "lang": "en"}
