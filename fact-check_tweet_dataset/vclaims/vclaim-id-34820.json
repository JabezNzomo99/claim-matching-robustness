Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: The footage shows Sinabung Volcanic Eruption in Indonesia on 9th June 2019. Fact: It is not a real volcanic eruption. It is a simulation generated as part of a research to show the effect of an undersea volcano eruption in New Zealand. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the video in the post is divided into frames using InVID tool and frames are run through Google Reverse Image search, newspaper articles with similar images can be found in the search results. According to an article in \u2018The Sun\u2019, the footage in the video shows a simulation generated for research purposes. It shows the effect on the Auckland city in New Zealand if the nearby undersea super-volcano erupts. So, the video in the post is just a 3D-visualization and it is not related to Indonesia.\n\nTo sum it up, a simulation video is being falsely shown as volcanic eruption in Indonesia.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of DECODE Lite series.", "lang": "en"}
