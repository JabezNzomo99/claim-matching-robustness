However, it falsely claims that hydroxychloroquine is the same as quinine.\n\nHydroxychloroquine is a drug that is used to prevent malaria and treat conditions such as arthritis, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It was first synthesised in 1950 as a less toxic alternative to chloroquine, according to the American College of Clinical Pharmacy.\n\nQuinine is a compound which comes from the bark of the Cinchona tree. It is also an antimalarial which is used to treat cramps.\n\nUniversity of Sydney pharmaceutical expert Dr Nial Wheate told AAP FactCheck the Facebook post\u2019s claim that quinine is hydroxychloroquine \u201cwithout fillers and preservatives\u201d is incorrect.\n\nAlan Armstrong, Professor of Organic Synthesis at Imperial College London previously rejected the claim, saying: \u201cHydroxychloroquine is a completely different chemical substance to quinine.\u201d\n\nProf Armstrong told Reuters: \u201cHistorically, hydroxychloroquine was discovered during efforts to synthesise alternatives to quinine as anti-malarials.\u201d\n\nRegarding the recipe, Dr Wheate told AAP FactCheck that he could not find any scientific evidence of quinine in grapefruit peels.\n\nHe added that a person would \u201cprobably need an entire bag full of peel to be able to get enough quinine from it to actually do anything\u201d.\n\nDr Wheate said quinine and hydroxychloroquine in their natural forms do not dissolve well in water and someone using the recipe would need to drink an \u201cunhealthy\u201d amount of water \u2013 about five litres per day \u2013 for it to have any effect.\n\n\u201cQuinine is massively dangerous chemical for people to be taking \u2013 it has really bad side effects,\u201d he warned.\n\n\u201cIf you get the dose wrong and take too much, you can get in serious trouble.\u201d\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claims in the Facebook post to be false. Hydroxychloroquine is a synthetic drug while quinine is a compound found in cinchona bark. Regarding the recipe, a pharmaceutical expert told AAP FactCheck he could not find scientific evidence of quinine in grapefruit peels and it would not create hydroxychloroquine.
