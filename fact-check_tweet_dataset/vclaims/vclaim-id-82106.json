He had voted for similar contracts in the past, and when the funding came up in August 2015, he cited concerns about videos that purportedly showed Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of fetal tissue.\n\nIn June, 2016, he changed course, and the funding was ultimately restored by a 3-2 vote.\n\nTo get a scope of the numbers of women that were affected, we reached out to Van Ostern\u2019s camp, which cited a 2015 WMUR article that quoted Planned Parenthood of Northern New England Senior Policy Advisor Jennifer Frizzell.\n\n\"According to details provided by Frizzell, Planned Parenthood of Northern New England served 14,191 patients at the end of 2014, but that number dropped by 21 percent, to 11,119, by the end of 2015 as a result of the \u2018lost funding,\u2019\" the article said.\n\nBut numbers from Planned Parenthood show something different.\n\nThe five Planned Parenthood clinics in New Hampshire saw 11,078 patients in 2014; the following year, they saw about 1,000 fewer patients statewide, according to numbers provided by the organization.\n\nIt turns out that the 21 percent drop the WMUR article references included patients that were lost when a West Lebanon Planned Parenthood clinic relocated to neighboring White River Junction, Vt. in 2014.\n\nBefore the relocation, Planned Parenthood clinics in New Hampshire saw about 14,000 patients. That number dropped to about 11,000 after the West Lebanon clinic moved.\n\nThe drop of 1,000 patients between 2014 and 2015 also takes into account a 5-week closure of the Claremont Planned Parenthood clinic after it was vandalized and heavily damaged.\n\nThat clinic served 948 patients in 2014, which fell 20 percent to 755 the following year, the steepest drop out of all the clinics.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Northern New England spokeswoman Victoria Bonney said the lost funding from Sununu\u2019s 2015 Executive Council vote affected access to services including family planning, birth control, well-woman visits, cancer screenings and STI testing and treatment, but patients were never turned away.\n\nBonney said the lost funding did not result in staff layoffs or denying patients care. Rather, it impacted scheduling and meant fewer patients were seen each day.\n\nSome health centers normally staffed with three practitioners a day had to scale back to two, according to Bonney.\n\n\"During the defund, Planned Parenthood of Northern New England never turned patients away and tried to meet demand with fewer resources,\" Bonney said. \"But when patients hear Planned Parenthood has been defunded, they put off health care. With so much media attention on Chris Sununu\u2019s 2015 vote to defund Planned Parenthood, patients may have been uncertain if they could still access necessary services.\"\n\nDemocratic candidate for governor Colin Van Ostern said as a result of Chris Sununu\u2019s vote against a Planned Parenthood contract, \"nearly 3,000 fewer\" women and families statewide accessed health care for birth control, cancer screenings and annual exams\n\nSununu, a Republican, did vote against a $639,000 Planned Parenthood contract in 2015. It led to fewer shifts at clinics, but no patients were ever turned away or denied care, the organization said.\n\nThe numbers cited by Van Ostern weren\u2019t accurate. About 1,000 fewer women accessed Planned Parenthood from one year to the next. His numbers, however, failed to account for one clinic moving out of state, and another one being closed for 5 weeks following an incident of vandalism.\n\nStill, some patients may have stayed away following the publicity surrounding the vote.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
