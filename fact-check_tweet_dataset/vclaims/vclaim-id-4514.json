But all of those items were readily available in the 1940s.\n\nHis t-shirt, for instance, bears the logo of the Montreal Maroons, a temporally appropriate hockey team that played in the NHL from 1924-1938:\n\nGlasses with protective side shields were also available in the 1940s. While this style of eyewear was not yet widespread, it is more plausible that the photograph shows a man of his time with unusual fashion sense rather than a time traveler:\n\nThe final nail in this time traveler\u2019s coffin comes to us courtesy of Kodak. While many viewers assumed that the camera that the man is shown holding is simply too small to have existed in the 1940s, Kodak did in fact make several portable cameras that were available in 1941, such as the following:\n\nThe man in the image may look out of place at first glance, but nothing about his appearance was impossible for the time the photograph was taken.", "lang": "en"}
