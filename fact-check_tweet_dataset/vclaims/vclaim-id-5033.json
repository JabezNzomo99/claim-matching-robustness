Caitlyn Jenner has reached massive publicity in the last few days after his/her appearance on the front cover of Vanity Fair. Caitlyn Jenner has even won the ESPY courage award, somehow.\n\nThere is no truth to the article. Huzlers is one of many fake news sites that aims to drive traffic by penning fictitious articles about trending issues:\n\nThe site has previously published fictitious stories about a man selling his son for an Apple Watch and human urine being found in cans of AriZona Iced Tea. The site is prominently featured on Snopes.com\u2019s \u201cDo Not Share\u201d list.\n\nHuzlers wasn\u2019t the only web site that attempted to capitalize on the transphobia that descended on the web after Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s Vanity Fair cover. In addition to the baseless rumor that Jenner had won the Arthur Ashe Courage Award over \u201crunner up\u201d Noah Galloway, another \u201centertainment\u201d web site penned a fake article claiming that Kris Jenner was planning to transition to male so that she could get back together with Caitlyn Jenner.\n\nIn May 2016, the story re-circulated, given slightly more credibility by Kardashian family biographer Ian Halperin, who quoted \u201canonymous sources\u201d:\n\nIan Halperin, the author of \u201cKardashian Dynasty: The Controversial Rise of America\u2019s Royal Family,\u201d said that, while researching his book, multiple sources told him that the former Olympian had been miserable for months and has considered transitioning back to a man. \u201cOne source confirmed to me Caitlyn has made whispers of \u2018sex change regret,\u2019 hinting she might go back to being Bruce Jenner,\u201d Halperin said. Halperin said that one long-time friend told him that, while Jenner was \u201cthrilled\u201d to champion transgender issues, the reality TV personality could de-transition \u201cin the next couple years.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
