Several social media users have shared similar posts on Facebook. While it\u2019s true that a bridge on the Jamnagar- Junagadh highway collapsed recently, it has no link with Narendra Modi. An official in the Roads and Buildings Department, Government of Gujarat told The Quint that neither did he plan, nor did he inaugurate it. We did a search on YouTube using keywords \u2018Junagadh,\u2019 \u2018Jamnagar,\u2019 \u2018Bridge\u2019 and \u2018Collapse.\u2019\n\nThis led us to news bulletins uploaded by various Gujarati media organisations. The bulletins were centred around a bridge collapse on the Jamnagar-Junagadh highway. No, Modi Masjid in Bengaluru Has Not Been Named After PM Modi An official in the Roads and Buildings Department, Government of Gujarat who did not want to be named, told The Quint that it was constructed 45 years ago and not recently as claimed in West Bengal Congress' tweet. \u201cFirstly, it\u2019s not even a bridge. It\u2019s a 24 metre long culvert that was constructed 45 years ago as per old guidelines. It\u2019s true that it collapsed recently due to some internal reasons, probably distress. However, neither did Narendra Modi plan it nor did he inaugurate it.\u201d Official in the Roads and Buildings Department, Government of Gujarat Further, a local reporter confirmed to The Quint that the bridge on Jamnagar- Junagadh highway did collapse on 19 June but it was not inaugurated by PM Modi. He also said that it was not built three months back but several years ago.", "lang": "en"}
