The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the company\u2019s actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and \u201crunning Mall of America into the ground,\u201d on the basis of Santa \u201calways having been white in the Bible.\u201d \u201cNo, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,\u201d Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. She also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was \u201cthe last straw\u201d in corporate America\u2019s twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, \u201cbecause they realized they couldn\u2019t make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques they\u2019ve been using so far.\u201d She added, \u201cThat\u2019s why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they won\u2019t shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I don\u2019t understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that \u2026 Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again,\u201d Palin added.\n\nLike all items published by Politicops, (and sister sites Religionlo, Politicalo, and Politcops), the article\u2019s first paragraph referenced a real debate over the Mall of America\u2019s black Santa. However, Palin made no such remarks about a boycott, and the tacked on fabrication is standard for this particular family of fake news outlets. Articles from Newslo and its sister sites typically begin with a paragraph of fact-based information before launching into fabricated details.\n\nNewslo\u2018s fake news sites often display under the lesser-known Politicops domain on social media, but all include a button allowing readers to \u201cshow facts\u201d or \u201chide facts\u201d to highlight the truthful material in the article.\n\nHowever, all articles display by default in \u201chide facts\u201d mode, so most readers view articles (or their headlines on social media) without embellishments marked:\n\nPrior Newslo fabrications included claims that Chris Christie thought that a female Viagra would cause an uptick in \u201clesbianism\u201d (and separately that he voted down a gender pay parity bill for Bible-based reasons), an Alabama politician tried to implement saliva-based \u201chunger tests\u201d for food stamp recipients, Ted Cruz affirmed he\u2019d run as a Democrat if something affected Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy, Mike Pence said that if abortion was legal in cases of rape women would try to \u201cget raped\u201d in order to obtain an abortion, the father of Brock Turner lamented the absence of punishment for the victim in his son\u2019s sexual assault case, and that televangelist Pat Robertson claimed David Bowie did not die, but was kidnapped by demons.", "lang": "en"}
