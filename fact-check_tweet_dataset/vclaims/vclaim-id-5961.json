I see them on the cover of People and Us constantly when I am buying my dog biscuits and kitty litter. I often ask the checkers at the grocery stores. They never know who Nick and Jessica are either. Who are they? Will it change my life if I know who they are and why they have broken up? Why are they so important? I don't know who Lindsay Lohan is, either, and I do not care at all about Tom Cruise's wife. Am I going to be called before a Senate committee and asked if I am a subversive? Maybe, but I just have no clue who Nick and Jessica are. Is this what it means to be no longer young. It's not so bad. Next confession: I am a Jew, and every single one of my ancestors was Jewish. And it does not bother me even a little bit when people call those beautiful lit up, bejeweled trees Christmas trees. I don't feel threatened. I don't feel discriminated against. That's what they are: Christmas trees. It doesn't bother me a bit when people say, \"Merry Christmas\" to me. I don't think they are slighting me or getting ready to put me in a ghetto. In fact, I kind of like it. It shows that we are all brothers and sisters celebrating this happy time of year. It doesn't bother me at all that there is a manger scene on display at a key intersection near my beach house in Malibu. If people want a creche, it's just as fine with me as is the Menorah a few hundred yards away. I don't like getting pushed around for being a Jew and I don't think Christians like getting pushed around for being Christians. I think people who believe in God are sick and tired of getting pushed around, period. I have no idea where the concept came from that America is an explicitly atheist country. I can't find it in the Constitution and I don't like it being shoved down my throat. Or maybe I can put it another way: where did the idea come from that we should worship Nick and Jessica and we aren't allowed to worship God as we understand Him? I guess that's a sign that I'm getting old, too. But there are a lot of us who are wondering where Nick and Jessica came from and where the America we knew went to.\n\nBen Stein, a lawyer by training, has also served as a speechwriter for President Nixon, has to date authored dozens of books (both novels and efforts), and continues to write editorials and columns for a number of publications.\n\nHe is perhaps best known to the world at large, however, for his in-front-of-the-camera work as the dreadfully dull economics teacher in the film Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off, his similar role as the monotonic science teacher on the TV series The Wonder Years, and as the keenly competitive host of the former Comedy Central Win Ben Stein\u2019s Money.\n\nMr. Stein has also offered occasional commentaries for the CBS news program, and the item quoted above is based on one such commentary, titled \u201cConfessions for the Holidays\u201d and delivered by on that program on 2005, one week before Christmas. However, we rate this item only \u201cpartly true\u201d because the versions of this piece which now circulate online typically contain transcription errors, present only a truncated version of the original, and include additional text and other modifications that were not part of the piece as it was first aired.\n\nHere is the full version as broadcast, taken from a CBS News transcript of the program:\n\nCHARLES OSGOOD: We all have our own thoughts about the holidays. Here\u2019s Ben Stein with his. BEN STEIN: Here at this happy time of year, a few confessions from my beating heart. I have no freaking clue who Nick and Jessica are. STEIN: I see them on the cover of People and Us constantly when I\u2019m buying my dog biscuits. I still don\u2019t know. I often ask the checkers at the grocery stores who they are. They don\u2019t know who Nick and Jessica are, either. Who are they? Will it change my life if I know who they are and why they\u2019ve broken up? Why are they so darned important? STEIN: I don\u2019t know who Lindsay Lohan is either, and I don\u2019t care at all about Tom Cruise\u2019s baby. STEIN: Am I going to be called before a Senate committee and asked if I\u2019m a subversive? Maybe. But I just have no clue who Nick and Jessica are. Is this what it means to be no longer young? Hm, not so bad. Next confession: I am a Jew and every single one of my ancestors was Jewish, and it does not bother me even a little bit when people call those beautifully lit-up, bejeweled trees Christmas trees. STEIN: I don\u2019t feel threatened. I don\u2019t feel discriminated against. That\u2019s what they trees. It doesn\u2019t bother me a bit when people say \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 to me. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re slighting me or getting ready to put me in a ghetto. In fact, I kind of like it. I shows that we\u2019re all brothers and sisters celebrating this happy time of year. It doesn\u2019t bother me one bit that there\u2019s a manger scene on display at a key intersection at my beach house in Malibu. STEIN: If people want a creche, fine. The menorah a few hundred yards away is fine, too. I do not like getting pushed around for being a Jew, and I don\u2019t think Christians like getting pushed around for being Christians. I think people who believe in God are sick and tired of getting pushed around, period. I have no idea where the concept came from that America is an explicitly atheist country. I can\u2019t find it in the Constitution and I don\u2019t like it being shoved down my throat. Or maybe I can put it another way. Where did the idea come from that we should worship Nick and Jessica and aren\u2019t allowed to worship God as we understand him? I guess that\u2019s a sign that I\u2019m getting old, too. But there are a lot of us who are wondering where Nick and Jessica came from and where the America we used to know went to.\n\nThe following bit about the White House\u2019s supposedly renaming Christmas trees as holiday trees began circulating on the Internet at the head of the Ben Stein Christmas piece in October 2011:\n\nBen Stein\u2019s \u201cConfessions for the Holidays\u201d debuted in December 2005, and the (false) \u201cthe White House is now going to call them holiday trees\u201d didn\u2019t appear until August 2009, so no, the former was not written as a reaction to the latter. (As detailed in our article, Christmas trees continue to be referred to as Christmas trees by the White House, and at no point were they ever called anything else.)\n\nIn mid-2006, someone added the following coda ( written by Ben Stein) to this piece. It combines older items about a television appearance that Anne Graham Lotz (the daughter of evangelist Billy Graham) made just after the terrorist attacks and the false claim that the son of child care expert Spock committed suicide:\n\nIn light of the many jokes we send to one another for a laugh, this is a little different: This is not intended to be a joke; it\u2019s not funny, it\u2019s intended to get you thinking. Billy Graham\u2019s daughter was interviewed on the Early Show and Jane Clayson asked her \u201cHow could God let something like this Happen?\u201d (regarding Katrina) Anne Graham gave an extremely profound and insightful response. She said, \u201cI believe God is deeply saddened by this, just as we are, but for years we\u2019ve been telling God to get out of our schools, to get out of our government and to get out of our lives. And being the gentleman He is, I believe He has calmly backed out. How can we expect God to give us His blessing and His protection if we demand He leave us alone?\u201d In light of recent events .. terrorists attack, school shootings, etc. I think it started when Madeleine Murray O\u2019Hare (she was murdered, her body found recently) complained she didn\u2019t want prayer in body our schools, and we said OK. Then someone said you better not read the Bible in school. the Bible says thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, and love your neighbor as yourself. And we said OK. Then said we shouldn\u2019t spank our children when they misbehave because their little personalities would be warped and we might damage their self-esteem son committed suicide). We said an expert should know what he\u2019s talking about. And we said OK. Now we\u2019re asking ourselves why our children have no conscience, why they don\u2019t know right from wrong, and why it doesn\u2019t bother them to kill strangers, their classmates, and themselves. Probably, if we think about it long and hard enough, we can figure it out. I think it has a great deal to do with \u201cWE REAP WHAT WE SOW.\u201d Funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder why the world\u2019s going to hell. Funny how we believe what the newspapers say, but question what the Bible says. Funny how you can send \u2018jokes\u2019 through and they spread like wildfire but when you start sending messages regarding the Lord, people think twice about sharing. Funny how lewd, crude, vulgar and obscene articles pass freely through cyberspace, but public discussion of God is through suppressed in the school and workplace. Funny how when you forward this message, you will not send it to many on your address list because you\u2019re not sure what they on believe, or what they will think of you for sending it. Funny how we can be more worried about what other people think of us than what God thinks of us. Pass it on if you think it has merit. If not then just discard it\u2026 no one will know you did. But, if you discard this thought process, don\u2019t sit back and complain about what bad shape the world is in\n\nIn 2014 the entire conglomeration mistakenly came to be attributed to journalist Steven Levy.", "lang": "en"}
