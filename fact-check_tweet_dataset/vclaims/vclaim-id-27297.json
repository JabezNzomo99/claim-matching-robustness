The full text of the prank, in Spanish, reads:\n\nA Google translated version of that reads as follows:\n\nFaced with the Catalan political situation, Andorra has unilaterally decided to close its border with Catalonia. This situation will force people who want to enter or leave the country in the coming dates to do so along the French border and take an important detour to arrive or return from Spain. This measure that came into force immediately has caused stupor and controversy in the community of Spaniards who are currently visiting the country of the Pyrenees.\n\nThe article is completely made up, although the current terrorism situation in Catalonia after the Barcelona terror attacks has obviously made people more nervous and inclined to believe fake articles like this one. Even if it were true, \"stupor and controversy\" would be unlikely: Andorra is tiny (really, really tiny, as in you can cross the entire country on foot in a few hours) so needing to take a detour via the French border to get back into Spain would take very little time anyway.\n\nThe main reason why the article is fake is that 12minutos.com is a prank website allowing visitors to create their own news articles. It carries following disclaimer at the bottom:\n\nThe site is part of a larger network of prank sites run by a Belgian company. Sites in the network include:", "lang": "en"}
