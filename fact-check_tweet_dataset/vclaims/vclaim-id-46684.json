Found through a reverse image search, the original image does not feature holes in the ice that form a ghoulish face but rather a single large gap in the center of the ice. Photographer Andrei Kudryavtsev posted it on his website and the Russian social media website VK.com in March 2012.\n\nSnopes found the earliest iteration of the photoshopped version posted on the Russian website Pikabu.ru in March 2015. It appears to have been digitally altered for Friday the 13th, per a Google translation of its caption.\n\nPeople cut artificial holes in the ice of the Irtysh River near Omsk, Russia, each year so that local winter swimming club members can swim in the river\u2019s frigid water, according to Reuters.", "lang": "en"}
