One ad uses Trump\u2019s words to say he is \u201ctoo dangerous for America.\u201d The other uses Trump\u2019s words to say someone with \u201cthis much contempt and disrespect for women has no business becoming president.\u201d But both ads air his quotes without context, when there are plenty alternatives that could have been used without the risk of creating a misleading impression to viewers. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nThe blackout indicates the claims about his \u201clove\u201d for war and his comment on \u201cnukes\u201d could have been made in two different instances. But that\u2019s not entirely clear. We concur with conclusions by PolitiFact and FactCheck.org, that the juxtaposition of these two clips with no context given to the latter could create a misleading impression to viewers that Trump \u201cloves\u201d \u201cnukes.\u201d\n\nHost Chris Wallace: \u201cYou want to have a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula?\u201d Trump: \u201cIn many ways, and I say this, in many ways, the world is changing. Right now, you have Pakistan and you have North Korea and you have China and you have Russia and you have India and you have the United States and many other countries have nukes.\u201d Trump: \u201cIt\u2019s not like, gee whiz, nobody has them. So, North Korea has nukes. Japan has a problem with that. I mean, they have a big problem with that. Maybe they would in fact be better off if they defend themselves from North Korea.\u201d Trump: \u201cMaybe they would be better off \u2014 including with nukes, yes, including with nukes.\u201c\n\nTrump has said in several interviews that Japan might be better off with nuclear weapons. As PolitiFact noted, Trump has declined to walk that statement back, which he was given the opportunity to do so many times. In an interview with the New York Times, Trump said: \u201cIf Japan had that nuclear threat, I\u2019m not sure that would be a bad thing for us.\u201d He has said in multiple other interviews that he would not \u201crule anything out\u201d regarding the use of nuclear weapons, though he considers them a last resort.\n\nPriorities USA Action spokesman Justin Barasky said it is clear they are aired as separate statements: \u201cIt\u2019s obvious to anyone that these are different clips and there\u2019s no suggestion all 5 are one statement. The only suggestion we make is that each clip shows that Trump is too dangerous for America, which we say at the end of the ad.\u201d\n\nIn this ad by Hillary for America, audio clips of Trump\u2019s comments about women play while images of women looking directly at the camera flash on the screen. The ad ends with a video clip of Trump telling Howard Stern that he \u201ccan\u2019t say\u201d he treats women with respect. The accompanying post on Twitter reads: \u201cA man with this much contempt and disrespect for women has no business becoming president.\u201d\n\nIn a 1993 interview on E! entertainment channel, Howard Stern asked about a comment attributed to Trump: \u201cYou have to treat them like s\u2014.\u201d This is a reference to a November 1992 New York magazine feature on Trump, in which the author wrote: \u201cHis contempt for beautiful women who like to be abused is boundless, and he is full of stories of supermodels, women he might call twelves (not their size), clinging to a rock star\u2019s legs and the rock star kicking them away. You have to treat them like s\u2014.\u201d\n\nStern: \u201cSo you never did say that?\u201d Trump: \u201cNo, I never said that, but it was attributed to me.\u201d Stern: \u201cI see. So you treat women with respect?\u201d Stern: \u201cAlright, good, alright. Somewhere in between \u2013\u201d Trump: [Interrupts Stern] \u201cI do, I do. I treat women with great respect.\u201d Stern: \u201c\u2013 treat somewhere in between respect and doodoo.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
