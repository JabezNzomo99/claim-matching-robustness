A spokesperson for Hillary Clinton denied the picture shows the Clintons.\n\nA number of white lawmakers and celebrities have faced criticism for wearing blackface over the years, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and talk show host Jimmy Kimmel.\n\nNow social media users are sharing a photo of a woman wearing blackface next to a man wearing overalls and a straw hat, claiming it shows \u201cyoung Bill, with Hillary in BLACKFACE.\u201d This particular post also features a logo from Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats aren\u2019t going to like this one!\u201d reads the caption. \u201cThe Clinton\u2019s at a costume party many years ago.\u201d\n\nBut, aside from the pair having a passing resemblance to Hillary and Bill Clinton, there is no evidence the Clintons are pictured. The woman wearing blackface in the photo appears to have dark eyes, whereas Hillary Clinton has blue eyes. The man that the post claims is Bill Clinton has visibly different facial features from the former president.\n\nPhotos of Hillary and Bill Clinton also show that the height difference between them appears to be larger than that of the pictured couple, according to Reuters.\n\n\u201cThe claim is 100% false,\u201d said Nick Merrill, a spokesperson for Hillary Clinton, in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation.
