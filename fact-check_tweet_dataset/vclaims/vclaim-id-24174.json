Now, a post is being shared widely on Facebook claiming that 20 lakh EVMs are missing from the possession of the Election Commission of India (ECI). Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: 20 lakh EVMs missing from the possession of ECI. Fact: Sheyphali Sharan, the official spokesperson of ECI, gave a clarification on her official Twitter account regarding this issue. She said that there is no truth in the claim that \u201920 lakh EVMs missing\u2019. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched for the news on Google, it was found that the source for this news is a story titled \u201cMissing EVMs\u201d available online on \u2018Frontline\u2019 magazine website (Print Edition: May 24, 2019). It reported that the information was based on the RTI replies got by Manoranjan Roy, an RTI activist in Mumbai. He also filed a PIL in Bombay High Court based on the information he got on EVMs through RTIs.\n\nAfter the article was published, the same was reported widely by other media houses like The Logical Indian and TV9 Bharatvarsh. As the article went viral, Sheyphali Sharan, the official spokesperson of ECI, gave a clarification on her official Twitter account regarding this issue. She tweeted, \u201cRegarding the story https://frontline.thehindu.com/cover-story/article27056139.ece\u2026 & news reports, it is clarified that there is no truth in contention that \u201c20 lakh EVMs are missing\u201d. The news report is based on inaccurate & specious misinterpretation of partial facts obtained from RTI from multiple Public Authorities.\u201d She also tweeted the letters written to Frontline and TV9Bharatvarsh asking them to \u201cobserve the highest professional and ethical standards in reporting and would not be a party, even unwittingly, to malicious efforts at spreading misinformation.\u201d She confirmed through her tweet that TV9 has deleted the story on this issue and Frontline Editor will publish a due rejoinder. So, the misinformation spreading over missing of EVMs is not true.\n\nTo sum it up, ECI has clarified that there is no truth in the \u2018EVMs missing\u2019 claim.", "lang": "en"}
