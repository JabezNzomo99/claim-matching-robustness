An Iranian Preacher Pushes Unproved COVID-19 Remedy", "subtitle": "Several research trials are studying the effect of salt and salt-based solutions against COVID-19.

On Aug. 6, he appeared on Tehran TV5 with advice on how to prevent a coronavirus infection.\n\nKheirandish removed a mask he was wearing during an interview, took a pill vial out of his pocket and said it contained salt \u2013 something he always carries. He claimed that salt protects against viruses and bacteria, is recommended by Islamic scholars, and that he takes it several times a day.\n\n\u201cEating salt frequently protects from corona infection better than wearing a mask,\u201d Kheirandish said, asserting that it cleanses the nose, mouth, eyes and ears and the entire body.\n\nThe claim is false and misrepresents both the purpose of wearing masks and the medicinal value of salt.\n\nMasks are recommended not to protect the wearer, but to stop the virus from being transmitted from individuals who are infected and who may or may not be showing symptoms.\n\nSalt and salt solutions (saline) have been used for centuries for wounds disinfection, body hydration via intravenous injections, eye and respiratory tract cleansing. But while researchers are studying salt as a COVID-19 treatment, nothing is yet conclusive.\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop Kheirandish\u2019s purported remedy from spreading on social media. Iran has reported 376,894 cases of COVID-19 and 21,672 deaths, numbers that are considered undercounts. As of Tuesday (Sept. 1), the country ranked 12th overall in total reported cases.\n\nTV5 posted Kheirandish\u2019s video on its Instagram page, where it has received over 7,000 likes and has been widely shared.\n\nOn his own Instagram page, where Kheirandish has 268,000 followers, the video has been viewed nearly 175,000 times. Kheirandish also runs a website that is reportedly one of the most popular places in Iran for those interested in Iranian Islamic medicine.\n\nTraditional medicine practitioners like Kheirandish have been called out before for offering questionable, nonscientific advice.\n\nIn a recent study, \u201cScience and Pseudoscience in Traditional Iranian Medicine,\u201d Kiarash Aramesh, a scholar at the Edinboro University of Pennsylvania, examined two contemporary streams: the \u201cquackery traditional Iranian medicine (QTIM) and the academic traditional Iranian medicine (ATIM).\u201d\n\nAramesh describes the QTIM as encompassing \u201ca wide range of practitioners with various backgrounds who work outside the academic arena and mostly address the public.\u201d\n\nThese practitioners, he wrote, \u201chave no solid bases or limited boundaries for their claims. Instead, they rely on making misleading references to the Holy Islamic Scriptures, inducing false hope, claiming miraculous results, appealing to the conspiracy theories, and taking advantage of the public resentment toward some groups of unprofessional healthcare providers.\u201d\n\nHossein Kheirandish, is one of the \u201cmost-famous practitioners of QTIM,\u201d according to Aramesh.\n\nWhile the Iranian health ministry takes disciplinary measures against QTIM practitioners, among its advocates and proponents are high-ranking Iranian government officials, Aramesh wrote.\n\nThe Iranian fact-checking website FactNameh looked into several claims made by Kheirandish and gave his \u201csalt advice\u201d a false verdict based on World Health Organization guidance.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins University school of public health has listed \u201c[d]rinking a lot of water and gargling with warm water and salt or vinegar eliminates the virus,\u201d among the debunked COVID-19 treatments.\n\nAmesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said that while COVID-19 may cause a sore throat, gargling with warm salted water \u201cmay make it feel better, [but] has no direct effect on the virus.\u201d\n\nStill, some researchers are looking into salt.\n\nIn June, scientists at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland launched a new trial to determine whether salt solution can help reduce symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nThe trial is a next step after a pilot study with results published in the Journal of Global Health in March. Titled, \u201cHypertonic saline nasal irrigation and gargling should be considered as a treatment option for COVID-19,\u201d the pilot study involved 66 adult volunteers infected with two different strains of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nIt showed that treatment with salt-water solution, known as saline, \u201creduced the duration of coronavirus infection by average of two-and-a-half days.\u201d The severity of symptoms was also milder in a group that used the salt solution.\n\nA similar study, conducted in Italy, concluded that \u201cSaline Nasal Irrigations can reduce the viral load in the nasal cavities. Oral rinse with antimicrobial agents is efficacious in reducing the viral load in oral fluids.\u201d Its authors recommended that public health authorities add saline to the measures to prevent and control the transmission of COVID-19.\n\nHyo-Jick Choi, a biomedical engineer and professor at the University of Alberta in Canada, has patented a salt-coated mask that purportedly traps the virus and kills it \u201cwithin five minutes.\u201d\n\nNone of these studies involves actually eating salt in its crystal or powder form, as suggested by Hakim Kheirandish.", "lang": "en"}
