Different iterations of the claim have been shared in multiple languages over 79,000 times on Facebook as of April 7,2020, according to Crowdtangle. ( here , here , here ).\n\nSome posts include a genuine news report from an ABC station, along with false video descriptions. One post claims: \u201cUSA just discovered the man who manufactured and sold the Coronavirus bio-weapon to China; Dr Charles Lieber, Head of Chemistry and Biology department at Harvard University, USA. He was just arrested today, according to American department sources. #StaySafe\u201d\n\nWhile the Department of Justice did arrest Dr. Charles Lieber, chair of the Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department at Harvard University, this was not for creating the new coronavirusnor nor for selling it to China. Lieber and two non-Harvard Chinese researchers were charged with lying about their alleged links to the Chinese government. Reuters reported on his arrest here .\n\nThe charges were part of an aggressive effort by U.S. authorities to block what they say are Chinese attempts to steal American scientific and technological advances.\n\nOn January 28,2020, prosecutors charged Lieber with lying about participating in China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan, which aims to attract research specialists working overseas.\n\nA press statement by the Department of Justice(DoJ) on this case is visible here .\n\nAccording to the DOJ, \u201cUnbeknownst to Harvard University beginning in 2011, Lieber became a \u201cStrategic Scientist\u201d at Wuhan University of Technology (WUT) in China and was a contractual participant in China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan from in or about 2012 to 2017.\u201d\n\nIn exchange for various payments (salaries and grants), Lieber provided services for the Thousand Talents Program for WUT. Lieber was accused of lying about his involvement.\n\nMisleading posts online pair actual news footage about Lieber\u2019s arrest with written claims that he was arrested for creating the new coronavirus and selling it to China. The original news reports by WCVB Channel 5 Boston and CBS Boston can be seen here and here .\n\nThe Reuters Fact-Check team previously debunked allegations on the new coronavirus being genetically designed or produced in a lab here .\n\nFalse headline: Harvard\u2019s Dr. Charles Lieber was arrested on January 28,2020,for lying about his alleged links to the Chinese government on a research program, not for creating or selling the new coronavirus.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
