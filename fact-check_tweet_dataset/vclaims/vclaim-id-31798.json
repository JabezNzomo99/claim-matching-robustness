The child pictured momentarily stood inside a faux cage set up at the event.\n\nWhile tensions flared in 2018 over the Trump administration\u2019s policy of family separation, a group known as the Brown Berets de Cemanahuac protested in front of city hall in Dallas, Texas.\n\nA photo from that event \u2013 pictured above \u2013 went viral, with many suggesting it was of a boy in detention, separated from his family. Others, like commenters on the Facebook post, claimed it was actually a photo taken during the Obama administration.\n\nNeither are correct, though. The young boy at the protest went inside a faux cage set up at the June 2018 protest, as reported by Snopes. The image does not show a migrant child detained by the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cThe little boy wandered in by himself and became upset when he saw his mother on the other side of the fence,\u201d according to Buzzfeed, which spoke to one of the attendees. The child was reportedly behind the fence for less than a minute.\n\nOther photographs from the same event show the young boy both inside and outside of the fencing, roaming free. (Politifact was able to nail down the exact photograph of the child, found here.)\n\nShortly after this protest, the Trump administration backed away from its policy of family separation at the border.", "lang": "en"}
