In a 5-4 decision in May, the Supreme Court rejected a California church\u2019s challenge to state rules restricting the number of people who can attend services.\n\nThe first part of Trump\u2019s claim, that \"Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church,\" is not consistent with Biden\u2019s statements.\n\nIn a speech in Darby, Pa., on June 17, Biden spoke broadly about the dangers of large gatherings and criticized Trump for not taking the coronavirus pandemic seriously enough.\n\n\"He\u2019s so eager to get back on his campaign, to his campaign rallies, that he\u2019ll put people at risk as everyone\u2019s pointed out, in violation of the CDC guidelines that still warn against large gatherings,\" Biden said.\n\nBut Biden hasn\u2019t said that churchgoers should be prosecuted.\n\nA Pew Research Center study of executive orders in effect on April 24 found that only 10 states prohibited in-person religious gatherings through extensive social-distancing regulations. Three of those states have Republican governors, and six have Democratic governors (Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is a member of the state\u2019s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party).\n\nIn Florida, religious service gatherings were exempted from Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 statewide stay-at-home order that went into effect in April. The order came after a pastor of a Tampa church was arrested for holding services that defied Hillsborough County public health orders. Prosecutors later dropped the misdemeanor charges against the pastor, citing his cooperation with social-distancing rules.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t find examples of Biden or any other leading Democrats saying they wanted to prosecute churchgoers for disobeying social distancing guidelines.\n\nThe second part of Trump\u2019s statement claims that Biden and other Democrats don\u2019t want to see people prosecuted for burning churches.\n\nDuring demonstrations against racial injustice and police brutality on the night of May 31, a fire was set in the basement nursery of St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church, which is near the White House. Earlier that day, Biden condemned the violence occurring at some Black Lives Matter demonstrations.\n\n\"Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. It\u2019s an utterly American response,\" Biden wrote in a statement on Medium. \"But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not. Violence that guts and shutters businesses that serve the community is not.\"\n\nIn a May appearance on ABC News' \"This Week,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said there is room for peaceful protest in response to the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\n\"I do think that there\u2019s a place for protest at the sign of a knee going into the neck of a person who\u2019s not offering resistance,\" Pelosi said. \"When you have a crowd, you will have those who will disrupt, and that is most unfortunate.\"\n\nDemocratic mayors, including Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, have also condemned destruction that\u2019s taken place at some demonstrations.\n\n\"When you burn down this city, you\u2019re burning down our community,\" Bottoms said in May after people set cars on fire during protests.\n\nTrump said that Biden and other Democrats were in favor of prosecuting churchgoers, but didn\u2019t want to prosecute people for burning churches.\n\nWe didn\u2019t find any leading Democrats who said they wanted to prosecute churchgoers for disobeying social distancing rules.\n\nWe also didn\u2019t find statements from Biden or other leading Democrats that people who set fires at churches shouldn\u2019t be prosecuted.\n\nIn fact, Biden and other leading Democrats spoke out against violence and burnings that took place at some Black Lives Matter demonstrations.", "lang": "en"}
