Please do not pay attention to any rumours,\u201d reads the tweet.\n\nAn Alt News reader recorded a video of the area today, February 26, on the condition of anonymity. Here, no gathering of protesters can be seen.\n\nOne can spot advertisement banners in the viral video and the clip shared by the reader. While the LIC banner is visible in both the clips, the other hoarding does not match. This suggests that the viral video was not shot today.\n\nSeveral photographs on Twitter show that a large group of protesters had gathered outside Inderlok metro station on December 20, 2019.\n\nIt is noteworthy that a women-led protest, inspired by Shaheen Bagh, has been organised right outside the station. However, as clarified by the police, there is no large gathering in the area either blocking the road or the metro today.", "lang": "en"}
