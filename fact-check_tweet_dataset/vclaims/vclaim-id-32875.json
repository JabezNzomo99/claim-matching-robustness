The images have been photoshopped or taken out of context. A satire website originally published the claim.\n\nThe composite image has made the rounds on social media repeatedly over the past few years, with this particular post claiming Bridge gave birth to 17 children, setting the world record for \u201cmost babies in a single pregnancy.\u201d\n\nBut a quick Google search revealed that Suleman, known as \u201cOctomom,\u201d holds the Guinness World Record for most children delivered at a single birth to survive. She set the record after giving birth to octuplets in 2009, according to the Guinness World Records website.\n\nImages included in the post appear to be photoshopped or taken out of context, further adding to the post\u2019s dubiousness.
