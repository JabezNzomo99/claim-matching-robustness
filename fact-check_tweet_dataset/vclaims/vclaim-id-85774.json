It is a broken process. Another data point to give your listeners is that the last four presidents combined from H.W. Bush to Clinton to W. Bush to Obama \u2014 in their entire first term \u2014 so all four of them, their entire first four years, 16 years combined, there were 32 filibusters, 32 on nominees. In 15 months this administration, we\u2019ve had more than 80.\u201d\n\n \u2014 Marc Short, White House legislative affairs director, in an interview on NPR, April 18\n\nDemocrats claim that too many of Trump\u2019s nominees were poorly vetted or had incomplete documentation, leading to delays. Trump has not helped matters by forcing out or firing key Cabinet members, requiring the Senate to set aside sub-Cabinet posts to focus on those more important nominations. He also has done little to reach out to Democrats, which might help smooth the way.\n\nThe rule change meant the majority could push through nominations that might have previously failed to meet a 60-vote threshold. But it did not mean that the lawmakers had to stop demanding a cloture vote on every nominee. Republicans were so infuriated by the rules change that they gummed up the works throughout 2014, requiring cloture votes on dozens of nominees even though many were ultimately confirmed unanimously or by voice vote.\n\nNote that Short, the White House aide, compared what is happening under Trump to the first four years of four previous presidents (32 filibusters vs. 80 in just Trump\u2019s first 15 months.) His numbers are correct, but the framing allows him to ignore what happened to Obama after the rules change. One can also argue that a new president should be permitted to quickly set up his administration.\n\nThe process is slightly speeded up if supporters file cloture on multiple nominees at once. They only have to use up the \u201cintervening day\u201d on the first nominee, but there are still up to 30 hours on each after that. In other words, filing cloture on four nominees would take Monday through Thursday for the first one, then 30 hours for each subsequent nominee, taking you into the following week.\n\nOpponents don\u2019t have to use up all 30 hours and can yield back time, so the week of April 9, the Senate was able to get through cloture motions on six nominees. But insisting on cloture votes slows down the process, especially because it now is virtually impossible to block a nominee since Reid lowered the threshold to a simple majority.\n\nAssuming each nominee is subjected to 30 hours of debate, that\u2019s 33,660 hours, or 1,402 days. But of course the Senate is not in session every day \u2014 only about 150 days a year. So that works out to almost 9.4 years, assuming that all the Senate did was work on nominations subject to a cloture vote. (Not every nomination is subject to a cloture vote, but, at the same time, one would expect the Senate to spend some time trying to pass laws.)\n\n[Update: After this fact check was published, House said that we should have measured based on the rate of confirmations so far. He provided documentation showing that 432 of Trump\u2019s nominees have been confirmed, with 314 by voice vote. In other words, about one in four have been subject to a cloture vote. If the same rate were applied going forward, that would mean 2.3 years would be needed to confirm Trump\u2019s remaining nominees, assuming the Senate did absolutely nothing else but confirm nominees. (In our previous calculation, we also had not counted intervening days.)\n\nTrump\u2019s full quote was: \u201cThey are \u2018slow walking\u2019 all of my nominations \u2014 hundreds of people. At this rate it would take 9 years for all approvals!\u201d The White House says that he was speaking about the rate going forward if all nominees were subject to cloture, and so that\u2019s measure that should be used. House denied that Democrats are slow-walking all of Trump\u2019s nominees.\n\nBoth sides point fingers over which party is responsible for this situation. Given the slow pace of Trump\u2019s efforts to fill his administration, we\u2019re not sure he could come up with an additional 900 names in the next three years. But it\u2019s clear that Democrats have slowed the process on even noncontroversial nominees, just as Republicans did in 2014.", "lang": "en"}
