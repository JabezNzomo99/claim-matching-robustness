No, that's not true, and here is some context: While the facts in The Scientist article appear to be accurate, the opinion piece is about a research study that is unrelated to the current coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, and has already claimed more than 25 lives.\n\nUsers are sharing the article published by The Scientist on November 16, 2015, titled \"Lab-Made Coronavirus Triggers Debate\" (archived here) to drum up conspiracies or sound alarms. The article opened:\n\nThe creation of a chimeric SARS-like virus has scientists discussing the risks of gain-of-function research. Ralph Baric, an infectious-disease researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, last week (November 9) published a study on his team's efforts to engineer a virus with the surface protein of the SHC014 coronavirus, found in horseshoe bats in China, and the backbone of to one that causes human-like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in mice. The hybrid virus could infect human airway cells and caused disease in mice, according to the team's results, which were published in Nature Medicine.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this:\n\nPeople sharing the article on social media are suggesting the current coronavirus was \"lab-made.\" Here are a couple of examples:\n\nThe 2015 article, labeled a \"news & opinion\" piece, discussed the debate in the scientific community about so-called \"gain-of-function\" research. This type of study carries the risk of transmitting \"potential pandemic pathogens (PPPs),\" according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). It has raised biosafety and biosecurity red flags.\n\nThe article in The Scientist even noted that the agency had placed a moratorium on federal funding of these studies. The NIH stated in 2013:\n\nAt issue, according to the article: a November 9, 2015, study published by an infectious-disease researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The research had been published in the journal Nature Medicine and demonstrated these findings:\n\nThis 2015 article from The Scientist about a gain-of-function study that created a SARS-like virus does not mean this current coronavirus outbreak was engineered then - or was even human-made at all.\n\nThe New York Times and The Wall Street Journal report that at least 26 deaths have been attributed to the current outbreak so far. On Chinese social media, people are expressing distrust of the authorities in Wuhan, and there are fears the government mishandled the outbreak.\n\nLead Stories reached out to The Scientist to add an editor's note or addendum to the story because the article is widely being misappropriated online:\n\nBottom line: the research discussed in the 2015 opinion piece from The Scientist does not relate to this current Wuhan coronavirus outbreak.", "lang": "en"}
