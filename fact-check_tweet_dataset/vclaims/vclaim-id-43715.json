No, that's not true: the story was made up by a fake news website that calls itself a \"fauxtire\" website. None of it is real and \"LIGMA\" is not even a real substance.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Huzlers on September 18, 2018 titled \"BREAKING NEWS: Rapper Tekashi 69 Has Died Of Apparent LIGMA Overdose He Was Only 22\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nNEW YORK - 22 Year old Daniel Hernandez famously know as Tekashi 69 was found dead by boyfriend in his New York apartment of an apparent LIGMA overdose. He was known for his unconventional appearance, controversial behavior and brute-force screaming technique in some of his songs. Hernandez rose to fame in late 2017 with the release of his debut single \"Gummo\". His boyfriend Julio Gomez found the rapper unconscious and called paramedics immediately after he couldn't wake him up he was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail so they may have confused it with real news:\n\nOnly a few days ago Post Malone was also declared dead from \"Ligma\" in another death hoax:\n\nAs we noted back then, \"Ligma\" does not exist: it is a made up word that is part of an internet prank:\n\nLigma is a fictional disease associated with a death hoax orchestrated by Instagram user ninja_hater that claimed Fortnite streamer Ninja had passed away after contracting the disease. The intention of this joke was to prompt concerned fans to ask what Ligma is, to which participants in the hoax would respond with \"ligma balls\" (\"lick my balls\"), a joke setup similar to Deez Nuts and Updog.\n\nHuzlers styles itself as a \"fauxtire\" website and carries a disclaimer at the bottom of each page:\n\nAccording to Splinter News the site is run by Pablo Reyes and David Martinez and according to Buzzfeed Reyes is involved with several other fake news websites. They tend to shy away from political stories, opting instead to write for a more \"urban\" audience, with stories about rappers, criminals and celebrities.\n\nWe wrote about huzlers.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Florida Man Did NOT Burn Down Home After Lighting Nike Shoes On Fire In Protest Of Nike's Colin Kaepernick Ad\n\u2022 Fake News: Police Did NOT Discover Over 250 Penises During Raid At Funeral Employees Home\n\u2022 Fake News: Kodak Black NOT Arrested Again Just 1 Day After Being Released From Jail On Marijuana and Illegal Firearm Charges\n\u2022 Fake News: Florida Man NOT Arrested For Hanging On Traffic Light And Sh*tting On Cars Passing Underneath", "lang": "en"}
