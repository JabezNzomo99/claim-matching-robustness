She was not set to testify against the Clinton Foundation.\n\nFacebook flagged this story as part of the company\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nMultiple news outlets reported on the explosion at the Paladino home on July 7, 2018.\n\nAuthorities did not suspect foul play as the cause, the reports said, but a gas leak instead.\n\nThe website didn\u2019t care about that, choosing instead to build a conspiratorial narrative built on Paladino\u2019s contribution to a report that supposedly led to all New Jersey schools being forced to buy EpiPens. She was a retired school nurse.\n\nThe website further embeds itself into false news territory by deeming this the fifth death in its \"Clinton body count series.\"\n\nWe\u2019ve debunked similar claims about the Clintons getting involved in shady business and plotting to kill others before. Like those claims, this one provides plenty of speculation, but no evidence to substantiate its headline.\n\nA woman died in a home explosion, but she was not set to testify against the Clintons.
