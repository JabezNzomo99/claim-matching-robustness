On June 13, President Donald Trump announced via Twitter that Sanders would be leaving the White House at the end of the month, thanking her \u201cfor a job well done!\u201d\n\nThe claim that Sanders described her job search as a struggle is unsupported. No such statement appears in any news reports online.\n\nA similar claim circulated in December 2018, when an anonymous source told Yahoo News that Sanders, despite trying to leave the White House, could not find a new job. \u201cEverybody\u2019s told her no,\u201d claimed the source, described only as a former transition team member. \u201cSarah can\u2019t find work.\u201d\n\nA second anonymous source, a former White House official, told the publication the same thing.\n\nWhen Yahoo News asked Sanders about the rumor that she was looking to leave the White House, she responded by saying that she was \u201ctraveling,\u201d providing no further comment.\n\nAlthough neither anonymous source claimed that Sanders herself said she was \u201cstruggling\u201d to find new work, the Facebook page Occupy Democrats made that very claim the day after the story first appeared.\n\nWithin hours of publication, Yahoo News updated its story, omitting any reference to Sanders \u201cstruggling\u201d to find work. The publication also removed the claim, offered by the same anonymous transition team member, that then-principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah no longer had an office or a phone at the White House.\n\n\u201cThe story should have noted that he retains an office in the Executive Office Building and a government cellphone,\u201d reads an editors note.", "lang": "en"}
