The president claims at some points that a shutdown would set back one of his priorities \u2014 upgrading the military \u2014 and at other points that a shutdown means \u201cshutting down the military\u201d or \u201cdevastating\u201d it.\n\nThe president, with his knack for repetition, has also said or tweeted that \u201cDemocrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers\u201d (Jan. 12), that Democrats will \u201ctake desperately needed money away from our military\u201d (Jan. 14), that \u201cour military gets hurt very badly\u201d (Jan. 14), that they \u201cwant to take money away from our military\u201d (Jan. 15) and that \u201cthe biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding military\u201d (Jan. 16).\n\nAll active-duty military personnel would keep working in the event of a shutdown. There would be no gap in their pay unless the shutdown lasted past Feb. 1, and otherwise they would continue on the job without getting paid until the shutdown ended or until Congress and the president agreed to cover their costs before it ended. (Note: A previous version of this article said the military would be paid up to Feb. 1.)\n\nThe last time the government shut down, in 2013, the military remained on the job and legislation to pay service members during the shutdown was signed by President Barack Obama. The same legislation, called the Pay Our Military Act, was used to bring back nearly 350,000 of the 800,000 civilian personnel who had been furloughed by the Defense Department. Because it was unable to pay death benefits to the families of soldiers killed in action, the Pentagon also contracted with a charity that footed those costs until the government could reimburse it.\n\nContractors whose work was fully funded would stay on the job. Although the Defense Department would be barred from executing new contracts, it could keep doing so \u201cwhere delay in contracting would create an imminent risk to the safety of human life or the protection of property, including endangering national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked before about the importance of maintenance on weapons systems and others, but if it\u2019s not an excepted activity, there\u2019ll be work stoppage on many of those maintenance functions,\u201d Norquist said in December. However, Trump or Pentagon officials could designate weapons maintenance as an \u201cexcepted activity\u201d under the Antideficiency Act and keep those operations running during a shutdown.\n\nTurning to Trump\u2019s other warning \u2014 that a shutdown would endanger his plans to \u201crebuild\u201d the military \u2014 it\u2019s important to keep in mind that a shutdown does not foreclose pathways in Congress for appropriating more money for military upgrades or lifting what\u2019s called a \u201csequester,\u201d or automatic cuts, on defense spending that would be triggered by a shutdown.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that Congress has made a bipartisan commitment to funding our national defense,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cRepublicans and Democrats work together to send a strong national defense bill to the president\u2019s desk, and right now we are actually engaged in good-faith negotiations to make sure that our budget, that our budget cap agreement reflects those commitments.\u201d\n\nWith the threat of a government shutdown looming, Trump repeatedly has warned that the military could be shut down or devastated and that his plans to \u201crebuild\u201d the armed forces would be thrown into question. In support of the president\u2019s claims, the White House points to comments from the Pentagon\u2019s comptroller, who said in December that a shutdown could stop maintenance on weapons systems.\n\nThe Defense Department\u2019s most recent contingency plan for a shutdown says all active-duty military personnel would stay on the job, as well as 22 percent of its civilian employees. Moreover, the president has broad authority to decide who stays on the job during a shutdown \u2014 an authority that extends to maintenance workers for military weapons systems. Trump himself tweeted in 2013 that the government continues to run \u201cessential services\u201d during a shutdown.", "lang": "en"}
