The information about the air strikes was reported by multiple media outlets all morning. While social media users speculated about the specifics of the air strike, a video went viral claiming to be the Indian Air Force strike on terrorist camps in Pakistan. A Twitter user Ajay Kushwaha, who is followed by PM Narendra Modi on Twitter, posted the following video on this timeline.\n\nThe video was also posted by a Pakistani Twitter user khalid_pk claiming it to be visuals of Pakistani Air Force retaliating to the Indian Air Force. This was one of the earliest instance of this video, which was then circulated in both Indian and Pakistani social media ecosystem with varying narratives.\n\nAbhijit Iyer-Mitra, a defence analyst, quote-tweeted khalid_pk\u2019s video and suggested that Pakitani fighters issuing flares is an indication that some air-to-air action took place between Indian and Pakistani fighter jets.\n\nAs the video spread like wild fire across social media, many people starting casting doubts regarding the veracity of the video. A Twitter user XULQIMOON claimed that the video was an old one and was a fly past by Pakistani Air Force on Pakistan\u2019s Independence Day \u2013 August 14th.\n\nMany other Twitteratis responded to khalid_pk\u2019s tweet suggesting that the video was an old one. Taking this cue, Alt News used the keywords \u2018islamabad paf fly past flares\u2019 on YouTube and looked for videos which might match the one currently viral on social media. We found a video posted on September 2016 by a YouTube user Muhammad Zohaib which was same as the video currently circulating.\n\nA side-by-side comparison of the visuals from the two videos, the old one available on YouTube and the one posted by Twitter user khalid_pk, makes it evident that the two videos are identical.\n\nThe aftermath of Pulwama attack saw a massive amount of misinformation disseminated on social media. Social media users should be vigilant as the same pattern is likely to continue.", "lang": "en"}
