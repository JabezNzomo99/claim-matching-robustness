It was taken from graphic video footage showing Floyd\u2019s death, starting around the 5:10-minute mark. His hairline is visible in the original footage.\n\nFloyd\u2019s hair is also visible in security footage the Washington Post used to create a timeline of the moments leading up to Floyd\u2019s death.

Video footage, witnesses, and autopsy reports prove otherwise.\n\nWe rate this post Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
