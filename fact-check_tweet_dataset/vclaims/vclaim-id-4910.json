Harris Didn't 'Lie' About Integration", "subtitle": "", "author": "www.factcheck.org", "date": "2018-07-13T12:43:39+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-4910", "url": "https://www.factcheck.org/2018/07/sen-harris-didnt-lie-about-integration/", "vclaim": "Q: Was Sen. Kamala Harris \u201clying\u201d when she tweeted about integration in the Berkeley public schools? \n\n\n\nA: No. The school district fully integrated in 1968, and Harris began attending public school in first grade, in 1970. \n\n\n\nPoliticians on the left have criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, to fill the seat of retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n\nAmong those pledging to oppose his nomination was Sen. Kamala Harris of California.\n\nShe posted two tweets following Trump\u2019s July 9 nomination of Kavanaugh \u2014 the first one expressed her concern about how he would vote on health care issues, and her second offered a personal story about the impact that the nation\u2019s highest court can have. She wrote:\n\nThe following day, the conservative website Gateway Pundit posted a story accusing the senator of \u201clying\u201d about being only the second class to integrate at Berkeley.\n\nBerkeley started busing students to fully integrate the school district in 1968, and Harris began first grade in public school in 1970.\n\nHowever, Gateway Pundit claimed that the public schools in Berkeley, California, had been integrated for years before Harris entered the classroom. It presented high school yearbooks from 1963 and 1964 as evidence.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that the high school was integrated, the rest of the district wasn\u2019t, according to a report commissioned by the school board that was completed in 1963 and led to the full integration of the district in 1968. The report itself isn\u2019t available online, but at least two academic studies that rely heavily on it are available.\n\nThe high school was integrated before the rest of the district because there was only one high school. All students \u2014 regardless of race \u2014 went there for high school.\n\nThe 14 elementary schools in the Berkeley Unified School District were a different story. They each drew students from the neighborhoods they were in. Those neighborhoods were segregated. So, while the schools didn\u2019t have an official segregation policy, they were, effectively, segregated.\n\nIn the years following the 1963 report, the school district and its community debated the best course toward integration, and in 1968, it started busing students between neighborhoods to achieve integrated schools from elementary through high school.\n\nIt was the first city with a large black population to do so, according to the Los Angeles Times, and was hailed by Dr. Martin Luther King, who said after hearing about the plan, \u201chope returned to my soul.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Harris\u2019 2020 presidential campaign told us that Harris started at Thousand Oaks Elementary School in 1970 \u2014 the third year of full integration for the district \u2014 after attending a private kindergarten.\n\nCharles Burress, the spokesman for the Berkeley Unified School District, wasn\u2019t able to confirm her attendance since schools are closed and staff is gone for the summer. But, he said, \u201cwe have no reason to doubt her word.\u201d\n\nThe Gateway Pundit story also claims that Harris attended school in Berkeley for only two years before moving to Canada, but, according to her office, Harris moved to Montreal in 1976, when she was in middle school.\n\nAlthough the Gateway Pundit story isn\u2019t true, it has been shared by Facebook and Twitter pages that have more than 3 million followers. It also has been picked up and posted by several other websites.\n\nUpdate, July 1, 2019: The Berkeley school district issued a statement on June 28, 2019, that said, in part: \u201cThere has been some confusion in the media and social media around the Berkeley schools and integration due to the fact that our high school was already \u2018integrated\u2019, as evidenced, for example, by high school yearbooks which show children of many race/ethnicities at school together prior to 1968. In Berkeley, we only have one comprehensive high school, so it was integrated by default (de facto). Our elementary schools, however, reflected the racial composition of our neighborhoods, which like many neighborhoods across America reflected the history of segregation stemming from policies which restricted the opportunities of non-white residents.\u201d\n\nThe district also said Thousand Oaks Elementary School in 1963 was 95.1% \u201cCaucasian\u201d and 2.5% \u201cNegro\u201d \u2013 which were the race categories used at the time. In 1969, the school was 53.4% \u201cCaucasian\u201d and 40.2% \u201cNegro.\u201d\n\nUpdate, July 3, 2019: We updated our story to reflect that Harris started at Thousand Oaks Elementary School in 1970 after attending a private school for kindergarten, according to her campaign. Her Senate office previously told us that she began at Thousand Oaks in 1969.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.\n\nTrump, Donald.
