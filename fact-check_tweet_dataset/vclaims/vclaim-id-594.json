The article included embedded tweets dating back as far as 12 November 2015, but its body text left the implicit impression that the depicted marches were a reaction to the Paris attacks, especially in statements such as \u201cHundreds of candles were lit at the French Embassy in Warsaw following the ISIS Paris massacre.\u201d\n\nThe march in question did occur, but it took place on 11 November 2015 (two days prior to the attacks on Paris). No one marching in the demonstrations was riled up about those events.\n\nSocial media claims about the marches in Poland further held that the events were ignored or purposely covered up by Europe\u2019s mainstream media. That was easily proved false, as Britain\u2019s Telegraph (\u201cEU flag burned as tens of thousands join Warsaw nationalist demo\u201d), Russia\u2019s RT (\u201c\u2018Communists will be hanging\u2019: Nationalist march commemorates Poland\u2019s Independence Day\u201d), Financial Times (\u201cPolish nationalists rail against Brussels in show of strength\u201d), Radio Poland (\u201cPoland commemorates Independence Day\u201d), Bloomberg (\u201cThousands March on Independence Day as Police Converge on Warsaw\u201d), Britain\u2019s Express (\u201cEU flag burned as thousands join nationalist march in Poland\u201d), and U.S. News & World Report (\u201cPolish extreme nationalists hold large anti-migrant march on Independence Day\u201d) all covered the rally on or around 11 November 2015 (as did independent social media accounts).", "lang": "en"}
