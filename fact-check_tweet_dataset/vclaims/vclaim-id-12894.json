A higher proportion of women aged 16-64 are in paid work than ever before and the same is true if you count everyone up to state pension age.\n\nThere\u2019s still a nine percentage point gap between the employment rate for men and women aged 16-64.\n\nWe also have very near to the highest ever percentage of women on FTSE 100 boards, according to the professional forum Boards Watch.\n\nThe FTSE 100 includes the hundred most highly-valued companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nAbout 27% of directors on their boards are women: 32% of non-executive directors and 10% of executive directors. The proportion seems to have fallen fractionally in the months leading up to March 2017, although that\u2019s nothing compared to the large year-on-year increases that came previously.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s true that the gender pay gap is the lowest on record by median hourly earnings. That\u2019s correct whether you compare hourly earnings across all workers, or just look at full time workers.\n\nThere\u2019s still a gap. If you knew nothing about two people except that one was a man, one was a woman, and both were working full-time, then you\u2019d expect the woman to earn about \u00a31.34 per hour less than the man.\n\nYour expectations would change if you knew a bit more about them. The gender pay gap varies according to things like age, how much you get paid, the hours you work and the type of job you do.\n\nWe\u2019ve discussed what these kinds of statistics do and don\u2019t tell us in our article on age, motherhood and the gender pay gap.", "lang": "en"}
