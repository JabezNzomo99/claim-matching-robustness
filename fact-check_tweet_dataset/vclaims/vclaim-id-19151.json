So, please share as much as possible.\u201d\n\nThe above message has been shared along with a video clip showing hundreds of women in hijab, marching down a street. The duration of the video clip is 39 seconds.\n\nThe video with the accompanying narrative has gone viral on Twitter and Facebook, with several individuals posting it on their timelines.\n\nAlt News has received requests for verification of this claim on the Alt News app.\n\nThe march by women, shown in the video, is not related to the recent developments in Kashmir after article 370 was revoked by the Union Government in August this year. Alt News broke up the video into several key frames, and reverse searched one of the frames. We found that this video had been posted on YouTube in December 2018 on the channel PMLN Videos. Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) (PMLN) is a political party based in Pakistan, founded by Nawaz Sharif.\n\nWe also found this video posted in tweets from March 2019. In the video, at 0:38 minutes, we found a banner which said \u2018Baramulla Central Cooperative Bank Ltd Branch, Hajin\u2019. This suggests that the video is from Baramulla district in J&K.\n\nOn further scrutiny based on this information, Alt News found that this gathering was a funeral procession which took place in Hajin area of North Kashmir. According to a News18 report of December 9, 2018, \u201cThree militants were gunned down by the forces in Mujgund, on the outskirts of Srinagar, after an 18-hour long gun battle on Sunday. Among the slain militants was 14-year-old Mudasir Rashid Parray of Bandipora district, whose photo holding an AK-47 surfaced a week ago\u2026The other two militants were identified as Saquib Bilal (17), also a resident of Bandipora district, and a Pakistani militant, Ali Bhai. \u201c\n\nAlt News also found a photograph of the funeral procession posted on the stock photo site, Alamy.\n\nIt may be noted that the video is NOT with regard to the recent developments in Kashmir. It has been available on the internet since at least December 2018.\n\nUpdate: The article has been updated to include more information about the video.", "lang": "en"}
