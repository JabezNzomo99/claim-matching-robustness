According to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, the airplane with 191 people on board skid off the runway and fell 35 feet down a slope before breaking into two pieces.\n\nIn a statement, Air India Express confirmed the death of 18 people on board including both the pilots.\n\nThe viral post shows an airplane and the events leading to its dramatic landing on the runway before the screen goes blank. All the details pertaining to the airplane and its landing on the night of August 7 keep appearing on the screen at regular intervals. Once the screen goes blank suggesting that the airplane has crashed, images of the tragic incident start appearing on the screen.\n\nTowards the end of the five minute long video an Air India Express flight can be seen taking off with a message on the screen appealing to people to 'help the channel grow big by subscribing and sharing'.\n\nThe viral video is being shared with different sets of captions.\n\nThe viral post below has been shared with a caption 'Air india express crash landing at Calicut airport.

This is a video simulation with real data of Air India Express flight 1344, a Boeing 737 registration VT-AXH from Dubai to Calicut Airport, on august 7, 2020. The plane overshot runway 10 and ended up at the bottom of a cliff'. \n\n\n\n\n\nPrepar3D is a flight simulation software developed by Lockheed Martin, an aerospace and security technology development firm based in the USA.\n\nHowever, the crash simulation clip seems to have some wrong information. The flight plummeted a gorge 35 feet below the hilltop airport, not 50 feet into a valley below the runway. \n\n\n\nBOOM reached out to MPC Flight Recreations. They responded saying the video was theirs, and that they specialise in recreating real life aviation incidents and accidents. They affirmed that the video is a computeried simulation of AIE flight 1344 with public data available about it so far.", "lang": "en"}
