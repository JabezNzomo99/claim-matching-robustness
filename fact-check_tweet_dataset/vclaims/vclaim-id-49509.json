One Avni Padeny\u2019s June 24 post drew 25,000 shares as of this writing.\n\nA parody account of Republic TV anchor Arnab Goswami (@GoswamiArnabRpt) also tweeted the picture and later took it down.\n\nAlt News has received several fact-checks requests for the photograph on its official mobile application.\n\nThe incident dates back to April 2020. A Twitter user has shared the same image on May 11 while writing, \u201cLodhi Gautam, son of Azad Gautam from Kardhna village of Mirzamurad police station area of \u200b\u200bVaranasi has taken a photo of himself placing his feet on the temple of Dih Baba in Adampur village. Take appropriate action, Azad Gautam is also claiming that he is a member of Bhim army.\u201d\n\nThe Twitter handle of ADG Zone Varanasi replied to the tweet stating that the accused has been imprisoned by Varanasi police.\n\nVaranasi police also replied to the user and wrote that a case was registered against the accused on April 24 and he has been arrested.\n\nAccording to a report published in Amar Ujala on April 24, Azad Kumar Gautam, a resident of Kardhana village in Varanasi, was arrested and sent to jail by Mirzamurad police for hurting religious sentiments. Gautam had also posted objectionable posts on Hindu gods on his Facebook profile.\n\nThe report further said that inspector Sunil Dutt Dubey of Mirzamurad police station told Amar Ujala that Daroga Brijesh Singh arrested Gautam from his house on the basis of a complaint. A mobile phone was also recovered from him.\n\nTherefore, social media claim that \u2018Mohammad Ansari\u2019 was arrested for desecrating a Hindu idol is false. The man arrested was Azad Kumar Gautam.", "lang": "en"}
