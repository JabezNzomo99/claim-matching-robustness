Yet, White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney misleadingly claimed authorities \u201chad arrested 17,000 criminals at the southern border.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump, too, included this figure in a letter he sent to Congress on Jan. 4, saying \u201c17,000 adults at the border with existing criminal records were arrested\u201d last fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30. The White House, and Mulvaney, used the figure to argue for the necessity of a border wall. But the figure includes more than 10,000 people who were stopped while trying to lawfully enter the country at legal ports of entry throughout the U.S., according to statistics from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nMulvaney made his claim on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Jan. 6, saying it was \u201cfrustrating\u201d that the administration and Democrats in Congress \u201ccan\u2019t even agree on the basic facts.\u201d But the administration is spinning these numbers.\n\nMulvaney, CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Jan. 6: One of the most frustrating things, Jake, about the meeting that we had yesterday was that we can\u2019t even agree on the basic facts. The DHS, Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen tried to point out that we had arrested 17,000 criminals at the southern border so far \u2014 well, actually, just last year \u2014 and Nancy Pelosi simply refused to accept that fact. She said, those are your facts, and trying to make the point there are not your facts and my facts. There are just facts. If you can\u2019t even have a basic understanding of the facts, it\u2019s going to be very difficult to come to an agreement.\n\nHere are the facts, according to Customs and Border Protection, through Aug. 31, 2018, one month shy of the full 2018 fiscal year:\n\u2022 Border Patrol, which is \u201cresponsible for securing U.S. borders between ports of entry,\u201d encountered 6,259 \u201ccriminal aliens,\u201d immigrants who were apprehended and had been \u201cconvicted of crime, whether in the United States or abroad.\u201d\n\u2022 Those 6,259 people stopped by Border Patrol had been convicted of 7,820 offenses, 46.5 percent of which were illegal entry/reentry offenses. More than 1,000 had been convicted of driving under the influence; 816 had been convicted on drug possession or trafficking charges. Three had records for homicide or manslaughter. See the rest of CBP\u2019s breakdown here.\n\u2022 Another 10,572 \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d were encountered by CBP\u2019s Office of Field Operations, which handles the 328 ports of entry in the United States, where individuals seek lawful entry into the country.\n\nCBP statistics don\u2019t include a breakdown of the convictions of individuals stopped by the Office of Field Operations at ports of entry, nor is there a breakdown for how many people were encountered along the Southwest border. However, every year thousands are turned away for various reasons at ports of entry across the country, from Buffalo, New York, to Miami to Seattle.\n\nWe do know that the number of those with criminal convictions stopped by Border Patrol in the first 11 months of fiscal 2018 (6,259) is 1.7 percent of the total apprehensions by Border Patrol in that time period (361,993). We also know, from CBP statistics, that nearly all of those total apprehensions occurred along the Southwest border.\n\nAs for the Office of Field Operations figures, those with criminal convictions made up 5.2 percent of those deemed inadmissible to the U.S. (204,288) in that 11-month period, and 56.5 percent of total inadmissibles were encountered at ports of entry along the Southwest border.\n\nSo, the administration\u2019s figure includes mostly people who tried to enter the U.S. lawfully through ports of entry, some of which aren\u2019t even on the Southwest border.\n\nWe asked the White House and CBP if they could provide more information about these figures as they relate to the Southwest border, but we haven\u2019t received a response. We will update this article if we do.", "lang": "en"}
