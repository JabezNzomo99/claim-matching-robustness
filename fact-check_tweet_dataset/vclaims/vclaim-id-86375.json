The video spliced together two different clips \u2014 one from a 2011 KBAK interview with actor Harry Belafonte and the other of Biden at a virtual town hall event with Hillary Clinton in April 2020.\n\nThe video has a photoshopped chyron that reads \u201cOn air: Joe Biden | The importance of this election.\u201d A soundtrack of snoring has been added.\n\nIt has a look of authenticity, but close observers might have been confused when, at one point in the short clip, anchor Leyla Santiago says, \u201cThis is your wake up call, Harry,\u201d referring to Belafonte.\n\nBelafonte, in a response to the New York Times, said the original video flub was due to a technical glitch, and he criticized the fake video.\n\nTwitter marked the content as \u201cmanipulated media,\u201d and the video was disabled on the platform \u201cin response to a report by the copyright holder.\u201d The video, initially shared by Trump supporter Brian Smyth, had 2.4 million views, according to the original tweet.\n\nWe sought comment from the White House, as Scavino is a White House official, but we were directed to the Trump campaign. Communications director Tim Murtaugh said: \u201cThis was a retweet of someone else\u2019s video, and it was quite obviously a parody. It is sad that there is actual concern that people could mistake it for the real thing, though.\u201d\n\nThe video is a clear case of splicing, or editing together disparate videos, which fundamentally alters the story that is being told. However, the edit is not necessarily as obvious as the Trump campaign suggests. Less-skeptical or less-observant viewers could believe the content of the video, given the fake chyron, and think Biden fell asleep during an interview when he did not.\n\nScavino\u2019s tweet is the latest example of the Trump team\u2019s efforts to cast Biden as \u201cSleepy Joe,\u201d mentally absent or unfit to run for president. The Trump campaign is also not opposed to altering images or video of Biden for political gain. As the 2020 presidential election ramps up, we will continue to hold both campaigns accountable for sharing misleading visual content with millions of potential voters.", "lang": "en"}
