An Ontario Superior Court judge denied the request. Justice David Stinson ruled that despite a risk to the right to vote, a full hearing would be required to grant the injunction \u2013 one that wouldn\u2019t happen before the October election.\n\nOn the day of the ruling, Pierre Poilievre, minister for democratic reform and the sponsor of the Fair Elections Act, praised the decision to CTV. Poilievre said, \u201ceverybody has some sort of ID to show who they are. And it\u2019s reasonable to expect they do so when they cast their ballot.\u201d\n\nDoes every Canadian have the ID needed to vote? First, let\u2019s look at what the law requires.\n\nUnder the Fair Elections Act, the voter information cards (VICs) issued by Elections Canada are no longer accepted. Canadians are required to verify their address, either through approved forms of ID or through an oath.\n\nThere are three ways to vote: One is with one piece of government-issued ID with name, photo and current address, like a driver\u2019s license, or a provincial or territorial ID card. Second is with a combination of documents like a student card and a phone bill, with at least one showing a current address. Third, voters can present two pieces of ID verifying their name, and swear an oath about their address. For this option, someone in the same polling division with proof of identity and address must attest to the oath. (See a full list of ID options at Elections Canada).\n\nAlthough Poilievre\u2019s statement is about personal identity, and not address, Canadians need to prove both in order to vote.\n\nLike Poilievre, some argue that everyone has identity documents by default of living and accessing services in Canada.\n\nIan Lee, an assistant professor at Carleton University\u2019s Sprott School of Business who has testified before the House of Commons and Senate committees on the Fair Elections Act, said, \u201cit is impossible to be invisible in Canada.\u201d\n\nIn an opinion piece in the Globe and Mail, Lee said that based on his own research, \u201cit is legally and factually impossible today to be digitally invisible with no identity of any kind recorded in any government database anywhere in Canada.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lee, every Canadian gets a health insurance card to access hospitals and clinics. Title deeds to property and tenancy agreements are required by law to include a name and address. Every university student is issued a school ID card. Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada also issues IDs necessary for receiving certain benefits. Identification is required to apply for Old Age Security and the Canada Pension Plan. At the very least, every Canadian has been issued a birth certificate and all naturalized citizens have received documentation affirming citizenship. This means that at some point, all Canadians had a document showing who they are.\n\nBut just because it\u2019s very likely that all Canadians once had ID, doesn\u2019t mean they still do, especially now that new address requirements are in effect.\n\nIn the decision against an injunction, Justice Stinson expressed concern that some people might be unable to vote under the new law. He wrote, \u201cbased on the evidence to date, there is a risk that some individuals who would otherwise rely on the Voter Information Card to enable them to vote will be unable to do so \u2026 which would result in irreparable harm due to their inability to exercise their right to vote in that fashion.\u201d\n\nThat argument is echoed by a number of experts.\n\nJon Pammett, a political science professor at Carleton University, said there are certain groups who are less likely to have the necessary paperwork at their fingertips, especially evidence of address. \u201cA substantial number would would either not have, or not readily have, such identification,\u201d he said.\n\nYasmin Dawood, an associate professor of law and political science at the University of Toronto, listed the people at risk of not having proof of address: \u201cThe groups that are particularly vulnerable are seniors living in long term care facilities, students in residence, homeless individuals, and members of the First Nations (and voters who have recently moved).\u201d\n\nPatti Lenard, a public policy professor at the University of Ottawa, said that even a driver\u2019s license might not be as up to date as a VIC. As for vouching, while it is still allowed, \u201cits use is constrained.\u201d Because of the new constraints, Lenard argued, \u201cthe more one is already a marginalized member of Canadian society, the less likely it is that one can meet the ID requirements imposed by the [Fair Elections Act].\u201d\n\nIn his ruling, Stinson also listed groups that could be disenfranchised, based on evidence presented in his courtroom: Students, the homeless, the elderly, and those who move during the election period.\n\nPoilievre may be right that all Canadians had identity at some point, but the statement is misleading. For one, it can\u2019t be assumed that everyone still holds long-ago issued documents. And when it comes to voting, simply showing who you are is not enough. Canadians must also show where they currently live, which adds a second challenge for some.\n\nIt\u2019s misleading, in the context of voting requirements, to claim that \u201ceverybody has some sort of ID to show who they are.\u201d\n\nSee how we score.", "lang": "en"}
