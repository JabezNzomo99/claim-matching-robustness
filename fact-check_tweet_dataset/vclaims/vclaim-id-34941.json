Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: The last speech of the Hyderabad Veterinary Doctor who was raped and murdered. Fact: The woman in the video is not the Hyderabad Veterinary Doctor who was raped and murdered. She is Allola Divya Reddy, the founder of Klimom Wellness & Farms. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nEven though it is not legal to mention the name of the rape victim, many news agencies have run news stories with the name of the Hyderabad Veterinary Doctor who was raped and murdered. The name should not be mentioned as per the directions of the Supreme Court, but her name is definitely not \u2018Divya Reddy\u2019.\n\nIn the video, at 0:37 secs, it can be seen that her name is \u2018Divya Allola Reddy\u2019 and she is the founder of \u2018Klimom\u2019.\n\nWhen searched for \u2018Klimom\u2019 on Google, it was found that it sells dairy-based products and focuses on indigenous cow breeds (Gir cows). On the website of \u2018Klimom\u2019, it can be found that the speech in the video was given by Divya Allola Reddy (Founder of \u2018Klimom\u2019) when she was awarded the \u2018National Gopal Ratna Award 2018\u2019. The extended version of the posted video was also uploaded by \u2018Klimom\u2019 on its YouTube channel. \u2018Klimom\u2019 has also posted about this event on its Twitter and Facebook accounts. \n\n\n\nIn a video uploaded by \u2018ABN Telugu\u2019, it was found that she is the daughter-in-law of the Telangana Minister Allola Indrakaran Reddy.\n\nTo sum it up, the woman in the video is not the Hyderabad Veterinary Doctor who was raped and murdered.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
