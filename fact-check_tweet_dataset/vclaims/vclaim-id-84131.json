The claim is false; the photos were taken in 2014 and show Widodo in a prayer session at an Islamic boarding school in West Java, which he visited on the campaign trail.\n\nOne of the misleading posts here contains a photo showing a man wearing white and an Islamic skullcap touching Widodo\u2019s head as men and boys, also wearing skullcaps, pray in the background.\n\nThe post, dated April 12, 2019, has a long Indonesian-language caption which refers to Widodo by his nickname Jokowi.\n\nIt says in part: \u201cValid information two days ago Jokowi was exorcised + increased his black magic power, since January 2019 Jokowi has often experienced being possessed, screaming a lot, and even talking by himself.\n\n\u201cAccording to the shaman who treats him: it happens because Jokowi has an ambition to become a leader for life using a wrong way, using a black magic and misguided mantra.\u201d\n\nIndonesia holds elections April 17, 2019. Here is an AFP story about the polls.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThis Facebook post, also published April 12, 2019, contains four photographs. One is a similar image of Widodo with text across the bottom saying in Indonesian: \u201cexorcism\u201d.\n\nIn the image, Widodo\u2019s eyes are closed and people can be seen praying in the background.\n\nThe other three images show three different men in Islamic clothes touching the chests of former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto and his running mate Sandiaga Uno.\n\nThe text on the bottom of each of the three images says: \u201cDzikir,\u201d a reference to an Arabic word which means \u201cremembering God\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Facebook post:\n\nHere is Yudhoyono\u2019s Twitter account. And here is the Indonesian General Election website that lists the presidential candidates in the April 17 election, in which Subianto, pairing with Uno, is running against Widodo.\n\nAnother Facebook post here shares the same photo of Widodo with a caption saying: \u201cMake your own judgement.. A touch in the chest by an Islamic scholar is following an example by the Prophet. A touch in the head means exorcism.\u201d\n\nThis Facebook post has been shared more than 5,000 times since it was posted April 12, 2019.\n\nA reverse image search on Yandex found that the photos of Widodo actually show an Islamic prayer session at a school in 2014.\n\nThe images used in the misleading posts are the same as in this photo essay published July 4, 2014, by Indonesian news outlet Merdeka.\n\nThe photo essay is subtitled: \u201cAfter campaigning at the Kerkhof field, Jokowi pays a visit to Jawawiyah Samarangan Islamic boarding school in Garut.\u201d\n\nThe caption on the original photo says: \u201cA Muslim cleric from Jawiyah Samarangan Islamic boarding school touches the head of presidential candidate Jokowi as he is prayed for.\u201d\n\nBelow is a side-by-side comparison of the photo in the misleading Facebook posts (L) and one published on Merdeka\u2019s website (R):\n\nGarut is a district in West Java province. Here is a Sindo News report, dated July 3, 2014, about Jokowi\u2019s campaign event at the Kerkhof field.", "lang": "en"}
