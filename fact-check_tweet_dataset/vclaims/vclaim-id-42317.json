But a wall wouldn\u2019t deter many of those migrants, who, according to government reports, make no attempt to evade detection.\n\u2022 California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, claimed that President Barack Obama \u201cdidn\u2019t change laws\u201d when using his executive authority to create the DAPA and DACA programs. But a federal judge ruled that DAPA was \u201cin effect, a new law.\u201d\n\u2022 Miller exaggerated the growth of the illegal immigration population under President George W. Bush, claiming it had doubled. It went up by 28 percent, according to Department of Homeland Security estimates. Miller said Bush failed to \u201c[defend] this country on the southern border,\u201d but Bush added hundreds of miles of border barrier and doubled the number of border patrol agents.\n\u2022 Republican Rep. Jim Jordan took Democrats\u2019 words out of context, claiming Hillary Clinton said \u201cwe need a borderless hemisphere,\u201d when she was talking about a \u201chemispheric common market\u201d for energy. Jordan claimed Stacey Abrams said \u201cnoncitizens should be able to vote.\u201d Abrams said she \u201cwouldn\u2019t oppose\u201d allowing noncitizens to vote in some local elections \u2014 not state and federal elections.\n\nOn Feb. 15, Trump declared the national emergency, which the White House said would enable the use of $8 billion for the construction of a border wall, with most of the money coming from Department of Defense budgets.\n\nIn making the administration\u2019s case for a border wall, White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller cited an increase in the number of people crossing the border who \u201ccan\u2019t be turned around\u201d and sent home, because existing U.S. laws and court decisions allow them to stay in the U.S. pending immigration hearings.\n\nBut a border wall would have no impact on such people since they readily turn themselves in to border agents.\n\nMiller made his remarks after \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Chris Wallace questioned the need for a national emergency to build a border wall at a time when border apprehensions are a quarter of what they were at the peak. Southwest border apprehensions peaked in 2000 at 1.64 million and have generally declined since, totaling 396,579 in 2018.\n\nWho are these \u201cnon-impactable\u201d people? We\u2019ll explain who they are and then why a border wall would not keep them out.\n\nIn a May 1, 2018, report to Congress, the Department of Homeland Security attempted to estimate the number of people who successfully evaded detection and crossed the border illegally. The report divides unlawful border crossers into two groups: \u201cimpactable and non-impactable.\u201d\n\n\u201cNon-impactable border crossers\u201d \u2014 the group Miller is talking about \u2014 \u201cinclude unaccompanied minors, family units, individuals who request asylum,\u201d the report says. This includes people from countries other than Mexico \u2014 primarily El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras \u2014 and their numbers are increasing, the report says.\n\n\u201cAliens in this group are described as non-impactable because, historically, they have usually been released into the United States with a Notice to Appear in immigration court for legal proceedings on a future date, rather than being subject to immediate DHS enforcement consequences,\u201d the report says. \u201cThese aliens are assumed generally to be \u2018non-impactable\u2019 by traditional DHS enforcement activities at the border because even if they are apprehended they are typically unlikely to be immediately removed or returned.\u201d\n\nAs we have written, the administration has criticized current laws and court rulings that provide for the release of unaccompanied children and families from countries other than Mexico until their immigration status can be resolved in court. But changing the laws, which the administration supports, would take congressional action.\n\nA wall, however, won\u2019t serve as a deterrent for the \u201cnon-impactable.\u201d\n\nIn a 2017 report, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office said many of the unaccompanied children and those traveling in a family unit \u201cturn themselves in to Border Patrol without attempting to evade detection.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s for this reason that the DHS, in explaining the methodology it used to estimate the number of people who successfully entered the U.S. illegally, assumes that \u201cthe non-impactable population\u201d doesn\u2019t attempt to evade detection. The 2018 report says \u201call unlawful border crossers in the non-impactable population are assumed to intentionally present themselves\u201d to border agents either at ports of entry or between the ports.\n\nThey \u201cmake no attempt to evade detection, and \u2026 surrender to the first USBP agent they encounter,\u201d as DHS said in an earlier report explaining its methodology.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that all \u201cnon-impactable\u201d people turn themselves in, but such an assumption helps to \u201cconstruct a probability model,\u201d the DHS said in its 2018 report.\n\nMiller has a point that the share of unaccompanied minors, family units and individuals seeking asylum from Central America are increasing, but the border wall wouldn\u2019t have much of an impact on this particular population.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who has filed suit to block Trump\u2019s national emergency from taking effect, said President Barack Obama \u201cdidn\u2019t change laws\u201d or \u201ctry to dismiss laws\u201d when using his executive authority to create programs known as the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA, and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.\n\nBut the federal courts ruled that Obama did try to change the law. In 2015, a federal judge blocked the DAPA program from taking effect, calling the new program \u201cin effect, a new law.\u201d Obama himself once boasted that he \u201ctook action to change the law\u201d when creating DAPA.\n\nIn a Feb. 15 interview on PBS\u2019 \u201cNewsHour,\u201d Becerra, a former Democratic congressman, was asked how his support for Obama\u2019s executive actions on illegal immigration squared with his lawsuit that claims Trump\u2019s action on illegal immigration is unconstitutional.\n\nBoth of Becerra\u2019s claims \u2014 that Obama\u2019s didn\u2019t change the law and Trump is not working within existing laws \u2014 are a matter of legal dispute. But, in Obama\u2019s case, the dispute has been settled and not in the Democratic president\u2019s favor.\n\nThe Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program \u2014 or DACA \u2014 was created by executive action in 2012. It defers deportation proceedings for two years for qualified individuals who were brought to the United States illegally when they were children. The Obama administration in November 2014 sought to expand DACA eligibility and the period of deferred action to three years, and to create a second program called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, which would defer deportation proceedings for parents with children who were citizens or lawful permanent residents.\n\nBut the DACA expansion and the DAPA implementation were successfully challenged in court by 26 states.\n\nIn his February 2015 ruling, Judge Andrew Hanen, of the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Texas, blocked implementation of DAPA and the expansion of DACA. In his ruling, Hanen described the DAPA program as \u201cin effect, a new law.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration appealed, but Hanen\u2019s ruling was affirmed on Nov. 9, 2015, by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans.\n\nIn his majority opinion, Judge Jerry E. Smith wrote that the Immigration and Nationality Act \u201cflatly does not permit the reclassification of millions of illegal aliens as lawfully present and thereby make them newly eligible for a host of federal and state benefits, including work authorization.\u201d\n\nThe circuit court ruling was affirmed when the Supreme Court deadlocked in a 4-4 ruling on June 23, 2016.\n\nIn their opinions, Hanen and Smith both used Obama\u2019s own words against him, citing a 2014 speech in which Obama said he \u201ctook action to change the law.\u201d\n\nWhen giving a speech in Chicago on immigration on Nov. 25, 2014, Obama was confronted by a heckler who accused his administration of breaking up families with large numbers of deportations. In response, Obama said, \u201cNow, you\u2019re absolutely right that there have been significant numbers of deportations. That\u2019s true. But what you\u2019re not paying attention to is the fact that I just took action to change the law.\u201d\n\nWhite House adviser Miller wrongly said that illegal immigration doubled under President George W. Bush. It went up 28 percent, according to Department of Homeland Security estimates.\n\nMiller also said that Bush failed to \u201c[defend] this country on the southern border.\u201d But that ignores some of the significant steps Bush took to protect the border, such as adding hundreds of miles of border barrier and doubling the number of border patrol agents.\n\nMiller made his comments when Chris Wallace of \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d questioned him about the president talking about an \u201cinvasion\u201d of the southern border. \u201cBut let\u2019s look at the facts,\u201d Wallace said, \u201c1.6 million people were stopped crossing the border illegally back in 2000, less than a quarter that many were caught last year.\u201d\n\nMiller responded, \u201cAs you know, when George Bush came into office, illegal immigration total \u2014 doubled from 6 million to 12 million by the time he left office. That represented an astonishing betrayal of the American people. I\u2019m not going to sit here today and tell you that George Bush defended this country on the southern border because he did not.\u201d\n\nThere is no exact count of the the illegal immigration population, but the estimates from the U.S. government show Miller is inflating the growth of illegal immigration under Bush. According to Department of Homeland Security estimates, which are based on an analysis of Census data, the population was 8.46 million in January 2000, the year before Bush took office, and climbed to 10.8 million in January 2009, the month he left office. That\u2019s a 28 percent increase, far from double.\n\nTo be fair, those aren\u2019t the only estimates of the illegal immigration population. The Pew Research Center estimated the population at 11.1 million in March 2009, shortly after Bush left office. Still, Pew\u2019s figures show a 32 percent increase from 2000 to 2009, not a doubling, as Miller said.\n\nMiller is certainly entitled to his opinion that Bush didn\u2019t do enough to secure the southern border, but his blanket claim that Bush did not \u201c[defend] this country on the southern border\u201d ignores the fact that hundreds of miles of border barrier were constructed after Bush signed the Secure Fence Act of 2006. The bill never lived up to its original promise of at \u201cleast two layers of reinforced fencing\u201d along about 700 miles of the border with Mexico. The bill was amended the year after its passage to give the Department of Homeland Security the flexibility to decide what type of barrier was appropriate in different areas, and DHS later determined that it needed fewer miles of fence than initially designated in the law. Nonetheless, the bill resulted in the construction of hundreds of miles of new pedestrian and vehicle fencing.\n\nUnder Bush, the number of border patrol agents doubled, from 9,821 in fiscal year 2001, the year Bush took office, to 20,119 in fiscal 2009, the year he left.\n\nIn addition, Bush issued a policy in 2006 that required people from all countries \u2014 not just Mexico and Canada \u2014 caught trying to cross the border illegally to be detained until they could be returned. \u201cThe Administration has effectively ended the policy of \u2018catch and release,\u2019\u201d the Bush administration said at the time.\n\nThe policy change cut the number of immigrants released from 113,000 in FY2005 to \u201cnearly zero\u201d by mid-FY2007 and increased the demand for detention space, according to an April 2009 report by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIn the years following those actions, the number of apprehensions at the southern border began to decline, from 1.1 million in 2006 to 858,638 in 2007, 705,005 in 2008 and 540,865 in 2009. Again, Miller can argue that not enough was done to protect the southern border under Bush, but Bush did take some significant steps to try to improve border security.\n\nOn ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Republican Rep. Jim Jordan defended Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration and said he was amazed by the \u201cdangerous \u2026 position that the left and the Democrats are now taking.\u201d But Jordan went on to highlight comments made by Hillary Clinton and Stacey Abrams without providing the full context of their remarks.\n\nJordan is referencing what Clinton said in a private speech to a Brazilian bank in 2013. According to an excerpt included in a Clinton campaign email that Wikileaks released in 2016, Clinton said: \u201cMy dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.\u201d\n\nThe full speech was not made public, so we don\u2019t know what Clinton said before or after that brief statement. But in the final 2016 presidential debate with Trump, Clinton said she was talking about \u201copen borders\u201d for energy, not immigration.\n\n\u201cWell, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy,\u201d Clinton explained. \u201cYou know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined. And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders. I think that would be a great benefit to us.\u201d\n\nJordan also left out important context from the remarks made by Abrams, the former Georgia state legislator who lost her bid to become governor last year.\n\nIn an interview with PBS\u2019 Margaret Hoover last month, Abrams said she \u201cwouldn\u2019t oppose\u201d allowing noncitizens to vote in municipal elections, not state and federal ones.\n\nThat\u2019s different from saying noncitizens should be allowed to vote in all elections, which may have been the impression that ABC viewers got from what Jordan said.", "lang": "en"}
