I\u2019d have to look it up,\" La Follette replied.\n\nOr perhaps he wanted to downplay how long he has held the job.\n\nLa Follette\u2019s opponent in the Aug. 14, 2018 Democratic primary, Madison Ald. Arvina Martin, told the Capital Times when launching her campaign \"it may be time for some new ideas, new blood and someone with a different point of view.\"\n\nSo, just how long has La Follette held the secretary of state\u2019s job?\n\nFrom the official Wisconsin Blue Book\u2019s list of secretaries of state:\n\nSo, La Follette served four years before being replaced by Phillips, the only black person ever elected to statewide office in Wisconsin. That was when he ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor.\n\nAfter reclaiming the office by defeating Phillips in the 1982 election, La Follette has since served in the job for another 35.5 years and counting.\n\nOver the years, the Legislature has gradually reduced the duties of the secretary of state. La Follette said in the interview his office once had 50 employees and now it\u2019s just him and one other full-time employee.\n\nThe winner of the La Follette-Martin race will face the winner of the two-way Republican primary in the Nov. 6, 2018 general election.\n\nSpencer Zimmerman of Janesville is campaigning to make the secretary of state\u2019s position Wisconsin\u2019s \"chief protocol officer for international relations,\" while Jay Schroeder of Neenah is campaigning to eliminate the office altogether.\n\nWhen we contacted La Follette about his statement, by the way, he said he would have to \"do a little calculation.\" Then later he emailed us, saying: \"Wow, I did some math. It looks like it is more like 40 years; let me say, time flies when you\u2019re having fun. Thanks for calling this to my attention.\"\n\nLa Follette says he\u2019s been Wisconsin secretary of state \"around 25 years.\"\n\nHe\u2019s held the job for a total of nearly 40 years.", "lang": "en"}
