In fact, I am an Indian citizen and I have spent more time in India than many of those who were distributing this leaflet yesterday. I love this country, where I have friends from Kashmir to Kanyakumari. In thirty-seven years of living in India, I have not faced hostility even once \u2013 until yesterday\u201c, wrote Dr\u00e8ze in a letter to Catch News. One year later false information is still being shared about his nationality.\n\nJean Dr\u00e8ze is a Belgian-born Indian development economist and activist. His work includes areas of hunger, famine, gender inequality, child health and education, and the NREGA. He was a former member of UPA\u2019s National Advisory Council for two terms. But the reason he is a target of a recent organised campaign is because he is the husband of the activist Bela Bhatia. DM Awasthi, DG Naxal Ops Chattissgarh, told the press on May 18th that Podiyam Panda, who\u2019s the former sarpanch of Chintagufa, had stated that Nandini Sundar and Bela Bhatia had met Naxal Commanders. It has been alleged that Panda was illegally detained by Chattissgarh police since May 3rd and that Panda\u2019s statements are a forced confession. It is also being alleged that Panda is being targeted for his role in protecting human rights of the villages around Chintagufa.\n\nIn a post truth world, many struggle with the concept of \u201cfacts\u201d. Additionally, with the wave of nationalism, some also struggle with the concept of citizenship. They routinely call Indian citizens as Pakistanis and find it difficult accept foreign born Indians as Indian nationals. Citizenship however is not something open to debate. It is not a topic where there can be a difference of opinion. The passport is a proof. Like it or not, Dr\u00e8ze\u2019s Indian citizenship is a fact. And as Moynihan, a US senator famously said, \u201cYou are entitled to your opinion. But you are not entitled to your own facts\u201d\n\nDr\u00e8ze is an Indian national since 2002. When asked recently in an interview, how did it feel to give up his birth citizenship, Dr\u00e8ze had replied, \u201cIt was one of the happiest days of my life.\u201d To the question, if India had offered dual citizenships, would his decision have been any different, he responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know. All I can say is that if the facility were offered to me today, I would decline. One citizenship seems enough.\u201d\n\nIn the last few days, several tweets have made a false claim about Dr\u00e8ze\u2019s nationality and alleged that a foreign national was a member of the National Advisory council under UPA. This tweet by Shefali Vaidya, a columnist at Swarajya was retweeted over 1200 times at the time of writing this article: \u201cJean Dr\u00e8ze, a Belgian national was a member of Sonia Gandhi\u2019s NAC for two terms, while wife Bela Bhatia allegedly was communing w Maoists!\u201d\n\nA similar incorrect claim about Dr\u00e8ze\u2019s nationality was also made by the film maker, Vivek Agnihotri, who called him a French national.\n\nThe factual error in Vaidya\u2019s tweet was pointed out by Sadanand Dhume, who tweeted \u201cI\u2019m no fan of Dr\u00e8ze\u2019s ideas, but as a factual matter he took Indian citizenship over a decade ago. In 2002 if I\u2019m not mistaken.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a factual matter. I\u2019m presuming that @ShefVaidya made an innocent mistake, and am merely bringing it to her attention\u201c, tried Dhume one more time with no result.\n\nA few others also pointed out the misinformation being spread but to no avail. Twitter user, Paresh @hiparesh highlighted that a false statement gets 1000+ retweets while a statement correcting it gets only one. While Vaidya engaged with another user, @sandeeproy1 by asserting there are no rumours in her claim, she ignored repeated attempts by Dhume and others for a correction of the obvious factual inaccuracy in her tweet. She also threatened legal action against @sandeeproy1 for using the word \u201cinsinuation\u201d in his tweet.\n\nFinally Dhume expressed his disappointment with his tweet, \u201cWe all make mistakes. But telling that @ShefVaidya won\u2019t correct the record even after I pointed out that Jean Dr\u00e8ze is an Indian national.\u201d\n\nDisagreement with Dr\u00e8ze and his worldview can surely be voiced without making fabricated claims about his nationality. An obvious lie has been widely shared even by those who know it is incorrect but don\u2019t seem to have a problem with it. In a world of alternative facts, this is not even seen as unusual. But Alt News believes that falsehoods and fake news must be countered each and every time. One day it will make a difference.", "lang": "en"}
