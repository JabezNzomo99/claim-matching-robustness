If we really do make ourselves the Brexit Party under our brand, my loyalty is going to be strained absolutely\u2026 I am not voting for some crazy right-wing nationalist organisation calling themselves a Conservative government\u2014but that I think is laying it on a bit, I don't think that\u2019s where we\u2019ll wind up.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly true to say, as Ms Abbott does, that Mr Clarke\u2019s comments received relatively limited media attention while Mr Austin\u2019s have been widely reported. And it\u2019s a legitimate matter of opinion as to whether media coverage of the two events has shown an imbalance against Labour or not.\n\nBut presenting the two sets of comments in a way that makes them seem precisely equivalent, to justify that charge of imbalance, is misleading.", "lang": "en"}
