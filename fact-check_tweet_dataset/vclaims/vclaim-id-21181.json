Once, while coming out after addressing the parliament, I happened to come face to face with her. She was accompanied by Gulam Nabi Azad and Mani Shanker Aiyer, who greeted me but Sonia kept waiting for me to greet her first. She forgot that the First Citizen of the country was in front of her. She had to acknowledge the President of the country and not Pranab Mukherjee. This greatly pained me from inside, that Sonia is so used to subservience.\u201d If Postcard News is to be believed, these are words of former President Pranab Mukherjee extracted from his book. But then Postcard News is not to be believed.\n\nThe Facebook page of the fake news website, Postcard News has posted an excerpt from former President\u2019s book that expresses his admiration for PM Modi and displeasure with Sonia Gandhi. Like a lot of other content on Postcard News, this screenshot is also malicious and fake.\n\nLast week former President Mukherjee took to Twitter to announce that he looks forward to \u201cpenning down my Presidential Years\u201d. The book titled \u201cThe Presidential Years\u201d will be published by Rupa Publications would be the fourth book in the series.\n\nThe earlier books titled, \u201cThe Dramatic Decade\u201d, \u201cThe Turbulent Years\u201d and \u201cThe Coalition Years\u201d, each cover a different time period. According to a statement by Rupa Publications, the autobiographical account will cover the presidential years of Pranab Mukherjee and will also touch upon his relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the NDA government.\u201d The book is slated for release in December 2018 to coincide with the author\u2019s birthday.\n\nIn an attempt to outdo itself, Postcard News has shared an extract from a book that is yet to be published. In fact, it is yet to be penned down by the author. Former president Mukherjee\u2019s earlier books covered the time period before his presidency. Postcard News has shared a fake passage which is from the period that has not yet been written about by the former president and will be covered in his new book, \u201cThe Presidential Years\u201d.\n\nEven though it is clear that the passage shared by Postcard News is patently fake, Alt News also reached out to former President Mukherjee\u2019s office to check if this was an excerpt from his books. His office stated, \u201cThe book ends when he became the President. Covers the period between 2004-2012. So where does the question of something in May 2015 arise?\u201d\n\nPostcard News has been at the center of fake news that gets circulated on social media. The founder of the website was recently arrested for circulating fake news. As we have always said, the fake news doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum. It needs an ecosystem of supporters around it who encourage it and help it to flourish. Alt News had documented several instances where prominent leaders of the ruling party have shared the articles of this fake news peddling website. Of late, the editor of the website has even found a place in debates run by Republic TV and has ironically shared views on the menace of fake news. With the likes of Postcard News receiving such encouraging support, we are certain that fake news, morphed images, and doctored videos will continue to be a part of our lives on social media.", "lang": "en"}
