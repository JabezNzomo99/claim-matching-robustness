Of the 55 African countries, we\u2019ve counted 44 which don\u2019t seem to face any tariffs on goods under EU schemes designed to support the least developed countries.\n\u2022 Four North African countries have a free trade deal with the EU which eliminate tariffs with some exceptions for food (though a limited volume of food products can still be imported tariff-free), and one more country (the Western Sahara) has the same arrangement\n\u2022 One (Cape Verde) can export around two-thirds of goods tariff free\n\u2022 Two (Nigeria and the Republic of Congo) can export around two thirds of products with reduced tariffs (for example Nigerian imports of cocoa powder face a 2.8% tariff, but with no arrangement the tariff would be 8%)\n\u2022 One (South Africa) has its own tariff arrangements with reduced tariffs on some goods\n\u2022 Two (Libya and Gabon) have no preferential trade terms with the EU\n\nSo Mr Farage has a point that the EU has some tariffs on African imports, but the vast majority of the African continent can export goods tariff-free to the EU.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve heard claims like this before on the EU\u2019s trading relationship with Africa and while Mr Farage is not technically wrong on this occasion, the general argument is sometimes expressed inaccurately.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the EU\u2019s scheme of preferential tariffs with African countries reduce tariffs more than similar schemes offered by other trading powers, including the USA.\n\nTariffs aren\u2019t the only form of trade barriers. BBC Reality Check said last year: \u201cThere may be other barriers\u2014such as regulations, product standards and customs documents to complete - but that also applies to goods from other countries outside Europe's single market, including the US, Japan and Canada.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
