The claim is false; the footage has circulated online since at least 2016 and shows Dutch children visiting a mosque in Holland.\n\nThe video was posted here and here on Facebook March 23, 2019 and has been viewed thousands of times.\n\nBelow are screenshots of the misleading posts:\n\n\"Conquest of Islam. Parents in New Zealand are sending their kids to Masjid to learn about Islam. New Zealand children take courses about Islam. This has brought about great interest in Islam in themselves to practice Islam. The New Zealand mosque massacre has led to a dramatical rise in interest in Islam all over the Western world among more and more non Muslims seeking knowledge about Islam and more mosques opening doors to all.\n\n\"The world is watching. We have to get this right. We have to make good use of it. We have to demonstrate to the rest of the world that love, peace, and compassion, sincerity, harmony and humanity are the basic principles of Islam.\"\n\nThe same footage and a similar claim has also been shared on other social media including Instagram, for example here, on YouTube, for example here, and on Twitter, for example here.\n\nBelow are screenshots of the misleading video and claim on different social media platforms:\n\nThe footage used in the misleading posts has circulated online since at least 2016.\n\nThe exact same footage was posted to YouTube here on December 26, 2016 with a Dutch-language caption saying: \u201cIndoctrination at Dutch schools\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the misleading video (l) and the YouTube video (r):\n\nIn the video in the misleading posts, a banner written in Dutch appears at the bottom of the screen which says: \u201cbidden in de islam is nog niet zo simpel\u201d.\n\nA journalist at AFP\u2019s bureau in the Hague translated this to English as: \u201cpraying in Islam is not that simple yet\u201d.\n\nThe man standing in front of the children can also be heard speaking Dutch while the children bowed their heads.\n\n\"Look between your feet. Alright, that's good. You stay in this position? I'll have a coffee.\" [Children can be heard laughing]. Elbows should not touch the ground. And hands near your ears,\u201d he said, according to AFP\u2019s translation of the Dutch comments.\n\nAn online keyword search for mosque visits by Dutch schoolchildren led to this December 30, 2016 report by magazine De Stentor, based in Zwolle, Netherlands, which contains a screenshot of the video in the misleading social media posts.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the article:\n\nThe Dutch headline translates to English as: \"Zwolle imam puzzled over video clip fuss.\"\n\nThe first paragraph of the story translates to English as: \u201cZwolle imam Mawlana Tahier Wagid Hosain Noorani of the Ghulzar-e-Medina mosque said he did not understand the commotion around a video clip of children who had visited his mosque. 'It was two years ago,' Noorani said. 'In the past two years we\u2019ve hosted several schools and groups of interested people. This was one of many tours.'\u201d\n\nThe report says the video was filmed at the Ghulzar-e-Medina mosque in Zwolle in 2014.\n\nThis is the Facebook page for the Ghulzar-e-Medina mosque in Zwolle, which gives its address as Koningin Wilhelminastraat 95 Zwolle, Netherlands.\n\nBelow is the location of the Ghulzar-e-Medina mosque on Google maps:\n\nAFP compared the video in the misleading posts with this photo taken inside the Ghulzar-e-Medina mosque published on a local news site named \u2018Zwolle in Beeld\u2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video (l) with the image on Zwolle in Beeld (r). Certain key distinguishing features can be seen in both, including the red patterned prayer mat floor, and two ornately carved pieces of wooden furniture at the front of the room:\n\nAFP contacted the Ghulzar-e-Medina mosque but they did not respond to requests for comment.", "lang": "en"}
