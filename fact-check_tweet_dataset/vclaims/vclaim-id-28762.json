The circulation of false images has been relentless, despite the Defence Minister herself saying that there are \u201cno numbers\u201d to give out.\n\nAlt News discovered that previously debunked images have resurfaced on social media, including an extensive circulation on WhatsApp, to show devastation across the border. The claims are being espoused with the help of a manufactured WhatsApp chat, which was taken down (archive) by its creator after Alt News\u2019s fact-check report.\n\nThe fake WhatsApp chat between an Indian and his \u2018Pakistani friend\u2019\n\nA Twitter user Shekhar Chahal shared a WhatsApp chat with an alleged Pakistani, who he claimed is a resident of Balakot. The \u2018friend\u2019 suggested that the Indian Air Force\u2019s air strike killed 292 terrorists of JeM. Chahal is followed by prime minister Narendra Modi on Twitter.\n\nIn the chat, Chahal\u2019s \u2018friend\u2019 said that his mother is the dean of \u2018Balakot Medical University\u2019 and was responsible for examining the dead bodies of the slain terrorists.\n\nAlt News, however, discovered that there is no such institution called \u2018Balakot Medical University\u2019. In fact, the nearest medical college is situated at a distance of over 40 km from Balakot.\n\nMoreover, the chat was replete with erroneous Urdu, hinting at its falseness. For instance, \u2018nazdiki\u2019 was spelt was \u2018najdiki\u2019; \u2018pareshan\u2019 was written as \u2018paresan\u2019; \u2018Alhamdulillah\u2019 was spelt as \u2018Allamuddiah\u2019; \u2018tashreef\u2019 was written as \u2018tasreef\u2019.\n\nAfter Alt News\u2019s fact-check, Chahal took down his tweet but clearly not before the damage was done.\n\nA set of images accompanying the manufactured WhatsApp chat shows dead bodies shrouded in white.\n\nAll of these photographs pertain to the 2015 heatwave in Pakistan that killed thousands of people. Alt News discovered original images on Getty (1, 2, 3) and TIMEvia a simple Google reverse-image search.\n\nAnother image doing rounds of social media shows mass graves.\n\nWhile Alt News was unable to discern its exact source, we found a 2016 article that carried the same photograph.\n\nGoogle reverse-image search also threw up a 2013 New York Timesarticle carrying a similar image. The photograph was sourced to Associated Press, which described it as, \u201cPakistani men prepare the graves of Saturday\u2019s bombing victims in Quetta, Pakistan, Sunday, Feb. 17, 2013.\u201d This photograph seemed to be of the same location as the viral image but taken from a different angle.\n\nYou can read a detailed report on all the above images here.\n\nThe collage highlighted above showcases alleged before-after photographs of the site bombed in the Balakot airstrike. This is an attempt to portray that while the building on the \u2018before\u2019 image (left) stands tall, the same building in the \u2018after\u2019 image (right) now stands pulverised. The identical imagery was also used in a Zee Newsbroadcast.\n\nWe, however, found that these are old, unrelated images. The site shown by Zee News was not the bombed site, and was, in fact, situated 5 km away from the site that was bombed. Moreover, the satellite image viral on social media and used by Zee News was five years old. Alt New\u2019s detailed fact-check can be accessed here.\n\nCirculating the same imagery, again and again, suggests an attempt to create a false perception in people\u2019s minds. After India\u2019s retaliation for the Pulwama terror attack, there has been a visible attempt to portray that the airstrike was able to take on nearly 300 terrorists. BJP President Amit Shah made similar claims despite the Indian Air Force and the government refusing to give a number.", "lang": "en"}
