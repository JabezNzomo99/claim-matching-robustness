They inspire conspiracy theories, it seems.\n\nA circulated screenshot of an August 2020 Facebook post called on \u201cantifa comrades\u201d to disguise themselves as supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump. By wearing Make America Great Again (MAGA) hats, U.S. flags, and even a \u201cconvincing\u201d police uniform, the post claimed, \u201ccomrades\u201d could deceive police and news media into thinking Trump supporters, not antifa, were rioting on Nov. 4, 2020, a day after the U.S. presidential election.\n\nSnopes readers shared a screenshot of this flyer and asked us to look into whether it was actually connected to antifa groups:\n\nAntifa comrades! On Nov. 4 don\u2019t forget to disguise yourselves as patriots/Trump supporters: wear MAGA hats, USA flags, 3%er insignias, a convincing police uniform is even better! This way police and patriots responding to us won\u2019t know who their enemies are, and onlookers and the media will think there are Trump supporters rioting so it\u2019s harder to turn popular opinion against us!\n\nWe found no evidence that this meme was connected to any actual antifa groups.\n\nWe should note that \u201cantifa\u201d\u2014 short for anti-fascist \u2014 is not a single group, but a very broad term referring to an amorphous coalition of leftist activist organizations that often act on their own initiative and don\u2019t have any centralized organizing body.\n\nThe flyer has circulated online before in 2017 and 2019, as well as in 2020. Conspiracy theories about anti-fascist groups rioting on Nov. 4 are common, especially across the conservative parts of the internet. However, the 2020 screenshot of the flyer was unique because it was attached to a post referencing the Nov. 3 presidential election, adding fuel to rumors that something could be afoot in the near future.\n\nWill Sommer, a politics reporter who also focuses on conservative media, investigated the origins of Nov. 4/antifa conspiracy theories and this meme in a 2017 Medium post. He pointed out how the above-displayed flyer was part of many \u201cfabricated \u2018planning documents'\u201d shared on Facebook that urge antifa movements to commit violence. Sommer\u2019s report also highlighted how left-leaning, anarchist media hub It\u2019s Going Down had disavowed any Nov. 4 activity.\n\nThe 2020 version of the meme, a screenshot, showed Facebook user Katy Krasnow sharing it to the Hickman County Antifa Facebook group. We reached out to Krasnow and tried to locate the Hickman County Antifa page, which appeared to have been taken down. Krasnow confirmed to us that she did post the meme and it was meant to be a joke. She found it when she searched for \u201cantifa memes\u201d on DuckDuckGo, a search engine. She said:\n\nWe reached out to Facebook to learn if the page was indeed deleted by a group administrator or by Facebook, and we will update this post if we receive more information.\n\nBut whether it was in 2020 or previous years, many people took such memes related to Nov. 4 seriously. Back in 2017, pro-Trump blog The Gateway Pundit ran a headline stating \u201cMillions of Antifa Supersoldiers Will Behead White Parents\u201d on that day. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones also claimed antifa activists would be handing out AK-47s on Nov. 4.\n\nSnopes investigated similar claims in 2017 that argued law enforcement agents had announced that \u201cantifa\u201d was planning \u201cextended violent unrest or civil war\u201d beginning on Nov. 4. We found there was no truth behind these rumors.\n\n@AntifaChecker, a Twitter account devoted to sniffing out phony \u201cantifa\u201d accounts, indicated it was not aware of the 2017 call to action:\n\nWe found no evidence of violent, antifa-led insurrections occurring in the U.S. on Nov. 4 over the past few years. On Nov. 4, 2017, there were anti-Trump rallies organized around the country by leftist groups, but these were far cries from cases of \u201crioting.\u201d In New York City, for example, around 300 people showed up, leaflets were distributed, and only a handful of Trump supporters turned up to counterdemonstrate, according to news reports.\n\nBecause the source of the above-displayed post confirmed to us it was shared as a joke, rumors of Nov. 4 activity have been disavowed by known antifa media outlets in the past, and we found that this meme had no connection to actual antifa activities, we rate this claim as \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
