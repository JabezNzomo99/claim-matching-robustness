The video is 1:45 minutes long, and shows passersby staring in amazement. The video has also gone viral with text which reads, \u201c\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u091d\u093e\u0921\u093c \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0918\u0941\u0938\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u092f\u093e \u091d\u093e\u0921\u093c \u0915\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0917\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0938\u093e \u0939\u0948\u201d (Is it the tree piercing the car or the car piercing the tree- translation).\n\nThe video has also been uploaded on YouTube with the claim that it is from Nantes, France.\n\nAlt News\u2019s fact-check found this anomaly is indeed from France, but it is a work of art. With the use of relevant keywords, Alt News found a news report by a French website Ouest France, titled, \u2018Nantes. With his tree in the middle of a car, Royal de Luxe is a sensation in Bellevue\u2019 (translated from French). According to the report of November 19, 2019, it is the handiwork of the Royal de Luxe, a local theatre group known to install logic-defying street art. The installation has been placed on the outskirts of the city of Nantes in Western France.\n\nThe same was posted by Royal de Luxe on its official Facebook page on November 18.\n\nIn another instance, the local street theatre company had installed a giant fork piercing through the roof and windshield of a car.\n\nIt may thus be noted that the video showing a tree growing through a car is a work of street art, installed in Nantes, France.", "lang": "en"}
