The posts, published in multiple languages, cite a document from the government of the Australian state of Victoria. But the Victorian government has specified that only joeys deemed unlikely to survive should be euthanised; a veterinarian consulted on the government\u2019s report also told AFP that euthanasia can be the humane choice for orphaned joeys.\n\nThe misleading claim was published in this Facebook post on January 8, 2020. It was shared more than 150 times alongside photos of a kangaroo and koala.\n\nThe post\u2019s lengthy caption states in part: \u201cFirst responders tackling bushfires in Australia are being advised to kill baby kangaroos and koalas who have been orphaned as a result of the crisis. The Victorian Response Plan for Wildlife Impacted by Fire directs that the rehabilitation of orphaned \u2018milk dependent joeys\u2019 from these \u2018common species\u2019 found in the fire zone is not supported.\n\n\u201cContrary to established practice, the plan urges against handing the animals to wildlife volunteers, stating \u2018these animals require significant long term care and cannot be successfully returned to the wild.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt least 28 people have died and as many as one billion animals may have perished during an unprecedented bushfire season in Australia, AFP reported here on January 20, 2020.\n\nSimilar misleading claims were shared thousands of times after being published here, here, here and here on Facebook; and here, here, here and here on Twitter.\n\nThe posts were shared in multiple languages, including here in Japanese and here in Greek, as well as in Polish; AFP's Polish fact-check team debunked those posts here.\n\nA similar claim appeared in this online petition titled: \u201cStop the killing of milk dependent kangaroo and koala joeys found in bushfires\u201d.\n\nHowever, these claims are misleading. The government of Victoria has updated its guidelines and made clear that only young marsupials deemed unable to survive should be euthanised.\n\nAndy Meddick, a Victoria Member of Parliament from the Animal Justice Party, stated publicly that such misleading claims were \"categorically untrue.\"\n\n\u201cThere's some rumours going around about how the Victorian Government plans on handling wildlife injured in the bushfire crisis -- stating that they all must be killed,\" Meddick said on Facebook here on January 7, 2020. \"I can confirm these posts going around on social media are categorically untrue and not government regulation.\"\n\nMeddick added that the office of Victoria Premier Dan Andrews has made assurances that \"their plan is to support the rehabilitation of wildlife and that any native animal that can be rescued will be rescued.\"\n\n\u201cThese untrue posts stemmed from a wildlife training manual published in 2017, which has since been replaced,\" he explained.\n\nThe training manual cited by Meddick, the \u201cVictorian Response Plan for Wildlife Impacted by Fire,\u201d was published by Victoria\u2019s Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP).\n\n\u201cWildlife Crew Teams will be deployed to undertake the on ground assessment of impacted wildlife, euthanasia or the capture and transportation of animals to a triage centre,\" the report reads.\n\n\u201cEuthanasia of wildlife impacted by fire should be undertaken where the health and wellbeing of the animal is significantly compromised, invasive or long term medical intervention is required, survival with treatment is unlikely, or if the animal will be unable to survive if released back into the wild.\u201d\n\nOn page 26, the report also list conditions for euthanasia, which include excessive burns, infectious disease, broken limbs and orphaned milk dependent pouch young, among others.\n\nFollowing misleading claims and allegations, the DELWP clarified its guidelines surrounding the euthanasia of orphaned pouch young on January 20, 2020.\n\nThe addendum, published here, reads: \u201cRecent allegations that regulations exist to euthanise all surviving wildlife are incorrect. The current Wildlife Shelter and Foster Carer Authorisation Guide states that \u2018wildlife experiencing unreasonable and/or incurable pain, distress, trauma, sickness or injury; or marsupials that are un-furred with eyes closed and ears down should be euthanised.'\"\n\nThe update adds \"This is about the welfare of the animal \u2013 and we will not unnecessarily prolong pain or suffering of animals. Our approach to caring for our wildlife has been developed in consultation with wildlife veterinary experts.\"\n\nAccording to a veterinarian who was consulted for the DELWP manual, age is the main criterion in deciding whether a joey should be euthanised.\n\n\u201cThe animals that are euthanased are the equivalent of a 12 week (or less) human foetus -- these are joeys that are less than 40 per cent through their pouch life -- eyes closed, unable to control their temperature, immature lungs, kidneys do not work, brain not developed, stumps for limbs,\" the vet, who wished to remain anonymous, told AFP in an email on January 15, 2020. \"Wildlife carers have tried for the last 50 year to get these animals to survive without success.\"\n\nThe vet also stated that such infant animals often \"die a slow death over days from starvation, hypothermia and from diseases of immunocompromise,\" stressing that a more \"compassionate euthanasia is to euthanase promptly to stop this suffering.\"\n\nThey added that the misleading claims were \u201cunfair\u201d to the first responders and animal carers battling the raging bushfires and its aftermath.\n\n\u201cThe people on search teams are there to do the best job that they can do in terms of animal welfare, in what are trying and difficult conditions,\u201d the vet said.", "lang": "en"}
