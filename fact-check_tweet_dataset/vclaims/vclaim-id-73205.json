Mark Meadows, R-N.C. and a leader of the House Freedom Caucus, said asking about citizenship is nothing out of the ordinary.\n\n\"The previous administration under President Barack Obama really was the first time that we didn\u2019t ask a citizenship-type question,\" Meadows said in a question to Ross. \"For the first time in a century, a citizenship question was not included in 2010.\"\n\nMeadows, who represents North Carolina\u2019s 11th Congressional District, which includes the state\u2019s westernmost counties, made the same claim at an earlier point in the testimony, saying citizenship questions were a staple of censuses \"prior to 2010, when President Obama decided not to include a citizenship question on the census.\"\n\nBut Meadows\u2019 statements muddle the facts because the citizenship question did not disappear entirely during the Obama years.\n\nHas a citizenship question been asked before?\n\nThe census has been administered every decade since 1790 to get a national population count used for determining the distribution of seats in Congress. The 1790 census asked for the name of the head of the family and the number of people in each household, including slaves.\n\nAccording to a history published by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2009, a question asking about citizenship status first showed up in 1820 and 1830. It was then asked of males ages 21 and older in 1870, and has appeared as a general question every decade since 1890, with the exception of 1960, when it was removed for unexplained reasons.\n\nWhat\u2019s unique about the Trump administration\u2019s proposal is that the question would be asked of all U.S. households.\n\nThe last time the Census Bureau came close to asking every household about citizenship status was in 1950.\n\nThat year, census workers knocked on doors to fill out the census by interviewing the residents of American households. They jotted down where each person was born and, in a follow-up question for those born outside the U.S., asked, \"If foreign born \u2014 is he naturalized?\"\n\nBut because citizenship was the subject of a follow-up question, not every U.S. household was asked about it, said D. Sunshine Hillygus, professor of political science at Duke University and a former member of the Census Scientific Advisory Committee.\n\n\"Census workers asked about citizenship as a follow-up question only to those households who reported someone was born outside the United States,\" she said.\n\nA decade later, the 1960 census asked about place of birth but not about citizenship. Then, beginning in 1970, the Census Bureau started distributing two different questionnaires: a short form sent to most households and a long form sent to about 1 in 6 households. Only the long form asked about citizenship.\n\nIn 2000, for example, respondents who got the long-form questionnaire were asked, \"Is this person a CITIZEN of the United States?\" But those who received the short form were only asked for the basics, such as name, date of birth, sex, and race.\n\nWhat did Obama change in 2010?\n\nThe 2010 census ditched the long form, using only a 10-question short-form questionnaire that did not ask about citizenship.\n\nThat\u2019s because the Census Bureau had also started collecting demographic and socioeconomic information through the American Community Survey, or ACS, which is sent every year to approximately 3.5 million households and does inquire about citizenship status.\n\nMeadows\u2019 spokesman Ben Williamson said the congressman \"was talking about the first time the decennial census was without a citizenship question on either the long form or short form.\"\n\nBut Meadows\u2019 claim that 2010 was \"the first time that we didn\u2019t ask a citizenship-type question\" gets the history wrong, since the Census Bureau asked about citizenship that year via the ACS, which effectively replaced the long form and was sent to a sample of households.\n\n\"The Census Bureau has long measured citizenship within the U.S. population (including in the Obama administration), but not as part of the decennial census of all U.S. households,\" Hillygus wrote in an email to PolitiFact North Carolina. \"So, the proposed citizenship question on the 2020 decennial census is a new addition to the census of all American households.\"\n\n\"We already have access to quality data on our citizens and non-citizens alike through the ACS,\" added Terry Ao Minnis, director of census and voting programs at Asian Americans Advancing Justice, a legal and civil rights group. \"In 2010, a citizenship question was asked on the ACS.\"\n\nIt has been asked every year since.\n\nMeadows said, \"The previous administration under President Barack Obama really was the first time that we didn\u2019t ask a citizenship-type question \u2026 for the first time in a century, a citizenship question was not included in 2010.\"\n\nThat\u2019s factually inaccurate. A citizenship question has not been asked of all U.S. households since 1950, when it was a follow-up for foreign-born respondents. In 2010, the Census Bureau sent a citizenship question to approximately 3.5 million households through the ACS.\n\nThis story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters\u2019 Lab and PolitiFact.
