We took a closer look.\n\nThe South African government has recognised international efforts to reduce\n\n. This means reducing naturally existing and artificially produced gases \u2013 such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide \u2013 that contribute to the warming of the earth\u2019s surface.\n\nOne way the government is trying to do this is by improving South Africa\u2019s\n\n. This is the combination of different energy sources (for example, coal, nuclear, gas and solar) that make up a country\u2019s total energy supply.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s government has said that\n\nwill come from clean or\n\nsuch as solar, wind and hydropower by 2025. The REIPPP is one of the ways it is pursuing this target.\n\nThe REIPPP encourages investment in independent power producers. These\n\nown or operate facilities that generate electric power for sale.\n\nTo help the government meet its 2025 target, independent power producers are meant to generate\n\nof renewable energy under the REIPPP programme. The goal was 5,000 megawatts from renewable energy by 2019 and a further 2,000 megawatts by 2020.\n\nSince the programme\u2019s start in 2010, the department of energy has been\n\nfrom wind, solar, gas and hydro companies. And according to Mantashe, by 2015 the percentage of clean energy produced through the REIPPP increased from 0% to 4.5%.\n\nWe asked the energy department for the source of the figures. They said Mantashe\u2019s statement referred to the renewable energy share of installed energy capacity.\n\nAnd the 4.5% figure \u201cis based on the 2,021 megawatts of electrical generation capacity from 40 Independent Power Producer projects that were connected to the national grid at the end of 2015\u201d.\n\nTo get to 4.5%, the\n\nmegawatts is expressed as a percentage of the 44,800 megawatts of electrical capacity generated that year. The baseline was 44,000, while 800 megawatts came from the\n\ncoal power station, which connected to the national grid in 2015.\n\nBut according to\n\nat the University of Cape Town\u2019s\n\n, it would have been more accurate for the minister to say that the increase in clean energy from 0% to 4.5% occurred between 2013 and 2015.\n\n\u2018The big advance has been the REIPPP\u2019\n\n\u201cThere were other clean sources on the grid before then, for example the hydro electric plants on the Orange River... but the big advance has been the REIPPP,\u201d Eberhard told Africa Check. Although the programme started in 2010, the first wind and solar projects only came online in 2013.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2013/14, REIPPP projects had generated only\n\nof clean energy. A year later, this had increased to 1,521 megawatts.\n\n\u201cThere have been three further major competitive bid windows since [2013], with a couple of smaller, dedicated ones,\u201d Eberhard said. Projects from rounds one to three are now online.\n\nWhat do the figures look like in 2019? As at June 2019, the total installed capacity was 47,970 megawatts: a baseline of 44,000 megawatts and an additional 3,970 megawatts from the Medupi coal power station, the energy department told Africa Check.\n\nmegawatts came from 64 independent power producers, bringing the percentage of clean energy to 8.3%.\n\n\u201cRound 4a and 4b projects are currently being built and will lift this percentage contribution even further,\u201d Eberhard said.\n\nGiven these figures, is the South African government on track to reach its 2020 goal of producing 7,000 megawatts of clean energy through the REIPPP?\n\nAccording to the\n\nof electricity have been procured from 112 independent power producers. But only 3,970 megawatts have been connected to the national grid. This is\n\nonce the projects from the last bidding windows have been constructed. The department of energy\n\nthat administrative delays had held up the construction stage of some projects.\n\n, a professor of technology management at the\n\n, told Africa Check that \u201cthe programme is working well\u201d, despite being expensive at first.\n\n, said \u201cthe REIPPP is one of the few good things that happened to South Africa, with relatively quick implementation\u201d.\n\nConclusion: Clean energy\u2019s share of South Africa\u2019s power mix rose from 0% in 2010 to 4.5% in 2015.\n\nGwede Mantashe, South Africa\u2019s energy minister, recently said the government had successfully increased the contribution of clean energy from 0% in 2010 to over 4.5% within five years.\n\nThis is supported by data from the Independent Power Producer Projects office and experts in the field. But much of the increase actually took place between 2013 and 2015. In 2019, the figure stood at 8.3%.", "lang": "en"}
