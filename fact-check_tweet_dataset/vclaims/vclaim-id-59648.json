In 2012, the most noteworthy voter fraud case in Indiana involved a Republican \u2014 when former secretary of state Charlie White was convicted of six Class D felony charges, including voter fraud, perjury and theft. \u201cProsecutors said he voted and took pay as a Fishers Town Council member of a district in which he no longer lived,\u201d the Indianapolis Star reported.\n\nPence actually meant to say 2016. We have noted before that there are relatively few cases of voter fraud, not \u201ccase after case.\u201d But for the purposes of this fact check, is Pence correct when he claims that people associated with a Democratic super PAC were prosecuted for \u201cvoter fraud\u201d and \u201cfalsifying ballots\u201d?\n\nIVRP was associated with Patriot Majority USA \u2014 which actually was not a super PAC \u2014 and had registered 45,000 people, many of whom were Black. The registrations were put on hold after election officials said at least 10 of the applications appeared to be amiss. The raid essentially shut down a project that was trying to boost minority registration in the state after Black turnout had declined significantly in 2014.\n\nWhat was the perjury? The Indiana voter registration form requires the person taking possession of the form from the registrant to complete an affidavit affirming under penalty of perjury that he or she \u201caccepted custody of this completed application from the applicant.\u201d (If the workers had used the federal registration form, there would have been no basis for a perjury charge because it does not have the same affidavit.)\n\nBut, again, only a few examples of falsified registrations were uncovered. In the case of Nash, 13 registrations with made-up addresses or phone numbers were cited, as he had told police that he \u201chad signed up \u2018drunks and bums\u2019 all day to get his quota for IVRP.\u201d In the case of Franklin, eight registrations were found for people who had not asked to register again but which she had copied from a list of registered voters to meet her quota.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing shows the system worked,\u201d said Celestino-Horseman, who is also a lawyer for the Indiana Democratic Party. \u201cClerks discovered the discrepancies in the registrations, which is what is supposed to happen. They check the information on the registration forms, and if there are no telephone numbers or the address is incomplete, they mail the registrant a letter.\u201d\n\nBill Buck, who had been a spokesman for Patriot Majority at the time, said IVRP itself was the main reason the clerks looked more closely at the registrations. \u201cThe IVRP, following the law, identified the questionable registrations,\u201d he said, after reviewing emails from that period. \u201cIVRP also followed the law in turning them in because it would be illegal to not turn in filled-in registrations.\u201d (This is to ensure organizations are not filtering out people according to party preference.) He added that \u201cthe individuals responsible for the work were let go by the project before the police raid that shut down the voter registration project.\u201d\n\nIn a May 2018 report, the Indiana Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights said the state\u2019s actions against IVRP \u201cmay have delayed or hampered legitimate voter registration efforts and incited fear among voters.\u201d The committee heard \u201ctestimony from an individual who tried to register to vote at the Genesis Center in Gary, IN shortly before registration forms were seized in Marion and Lake County. By the time she checked to see if her registration was processed and learned it was not, it was too late to register and she was unable to vote in the 2016 presidential election.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
