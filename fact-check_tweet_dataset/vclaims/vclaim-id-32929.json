Ong put the \u201csocial media\u201d photo at the top and the \u201cABS-CBN report\u201d at the bottom.\n\nThe post did not specify which rally it was referring to, but Ong shared the graphic on Monday, February 24 \u2013 two days after a few groups staged a protest and prayer vigil at the EDSA People Power Monument in Quezon City. It was also the eve of the 34th EDSA revolution anniversary.\n\nThe facts: None of ABS-CBN\u2019s recent articles on rallies and on the EDSA People Power revolution included the image labeled \u201cABS-CBN report\u201d on Ong\u2019s post. The photo of the crowd was a stock photo of Iglesia ni Cristo members gathered at the Philippine Arena.\n\nRappler also reached out to Ong to ask for the source of his post, but we received no response.\n\nMeanwhile, the image labeled \u201csocial media\u201d in Ong's post was from an event on February 22, where a few groups organized a rally at the People Power Monument. This was also reported by several news outlets including ABS-CBN, Philippine Star, and GMA News Online.\n\nOn February 24, the day Ong posted the graphic on Facebook, ABS-CBN also published a photo of protesters calling for press freedom in Quezon City on the eve of the EDSA revolution anniversary. ABS-CBN did not claim that the attendees there were \u201cthousands,\u201d either.\n\nAs of February 26, the bills on ABS-CBN\u2019s franchise renewal remain pending in Congress. If the franchise is not renewed and a provisional permit granted by the National Telecommunications Commission is questioned in court, the media network\u2019s broadcast arm would have to cease operations after its expiration on May 4. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
