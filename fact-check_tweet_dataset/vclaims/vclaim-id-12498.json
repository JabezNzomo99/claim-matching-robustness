A video doing rounds on social media since before PM Imran Khan\u2019s statement is still being shared, claiming that the woman in the clip is wing commander Varthaman\u2019s wife requesting the BJP to not politicise the sacrifice of soldiers.\n\nSP MLA Rajesh Yadav was among those who shared the clip.\n\nIndian Youth Congress\u2019s online magazine Yuva Desh also tweeted the video with the identical claim.\n\nCongress Seva Dal member Harvinder Singh tweeted the video as well.\n\nThe clip is also viral on Facebook.\n\nIf one listens to the woman\u2019s statements made in the video, she begins with saying \u2013 \u201cI am the wife of an army officer.\u201d A little further into the clip, she can be heard saying, \u201c\u2026just imagine the kind of tension, the kind of pain the family of Abhinandan is going through right now.\u201d As the woman refers to wing commander Abhinandan\u2019s family in the third person, it is apparent that she cannot be his wife.\n\nThe woman in the video is one Sirisha Rao.\n\nRao is a volunteer with AAP Haryana.

On behalf of the families of all the armed forces, I request my fellow Indians, especially the political leaders, the political leaders not to politicise the sacrifice of our soldiers. It takes so much to be a soldier. And just imagine the kind of tension, the kind of pain the family of Abhinandan is going through right now. So please till the time the tension is eased at Indo-Pak border stop your political rallies and don\u2019t you dare, I repeat, don\u2019t you dare snatch away the credit of our soldiers. So please stop counting your tickets and stop doing your politics. You have enough times to play your politics but not at this time and not at the cost of our soldiers\u2019 sacrifice. It is my humble request to all political leaders, especially the BJP political leaders.\u201d\n\nMisinformation is on the rise since the start of the ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan.
