Jim Jordan made a statement critical of coronavirus shelter-in-place orders during a March 25 appearance on Fox News, saying, \u201cIf a few senior citizens die, I can live with that.\u201d\n\nJordan never made the statement in question and didn\u2019t appear on Fox News on March 25.\n\nMany state governments have ordered residents to stay at home in an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Ohio, for example, issued a statewide stay-at-home order that went into effect on March 23 and is expected to remain in place until at least April 6, according to CNN.\n\nSome social media users have attributed to Jordan a statement critical of such coronavirus lockdown measures. He made the remark during a March 25 appearance on \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d it claims.\n\nI\u2019m not too concerned about the Chinese Virus. This is the worst economic crisis we\u2019ve seen in 200 years. We\u2019ve got to end the ridiculous \u2018Shelter in Place\u2019 orders. I\u2019ve spoken to many senior citizens and they\u2019re willing to take the risk and go back to work. If a few senior citizens die, I can live with that. Plus we won\u2019t have to pay them their social security \u2018handout.\u2019\n\nJordan never made the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post, however. Nor did he make an appearance on Fox News on March 25.

Videos and transcripts from Fox News show the Ohio congressman didn\u2019t appear on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d that day.\n\n\u201cCongressman Jordan neither made that Fox appearance nor made that comment,\u201d Ian Fury, communications director for Jordan\u2019s office, confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller.", "lang": "en"}
