The claim is false; the video has been doctored from an original news report in which the president's campaign team rejected the opposition candidate\u2019s data about the voting results in two Indonesian provinces.\n\nThe misleading footage has been shared repeatedly on social media, for example this April 25, 2019, Facebook post, where the clip has been watched 259,000 times and shared more than 10,900 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe Indonesian-language white text across the video says: \u201cViral video: Jokowi\u2019s TKN Team concedes defeat of Jokowi\u201d.\n\nJokowi is Widodo\u2019s popular nickname. \u201cTKN\u201d references his re-election campaign team. Here is a report by Indonesian news portal Liputan6 on the campaign team.\n\nThe translated caption of the Facebook post reads: \u201cA viral video is spreading, Lukman Edi from Jokowi\u2019s TKN concedes defeat of Jokowi against Prabowo. It has been very clear who lost the election. But the leadership in the candidate 01\u2019s team still insists on remaining in power by misleading the public through the broadcast of quick count results and cheating. Make this video viral. #2019PrabowoIndonesianPresident.\u201d\n\n\u201c01\u201d is Widodo\u2019s election ballot number. \u201cPrabowo\u201d is his sole rival in the elections, Prabowo Subianto. Here is the General Elections Commission\u2019s official announcement on the two presidential candidates and their ballot numbers.\n\nThe claim is false; the video has been doctored from an original news report in which Jokowi's campaign team rejected Prabowo's campaign team's data about the voting results in two Indonesian provinces.\n\nAFP did a search on Google of key frames of the misleading footage obtained using digital verification tool InVid.\n\nThe search found that the misleading clip contains exactly the same footage as this original April 24, 2019, report by Liputan6, headlined: \u201cVIDEO: Jokowi\u2019s TKN rejects Prabowo\u2019s BPN real count data.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Liputan6 report:\n\n\n\n The two videos are 42 seconds long, but the misleading clip has added the text \u201cViral video: Jokowi\u2019s TKN Team concedes defeat of Jokowi\u201d over the original Liputan6 footage.\n\nIn both videos, a member of Widodo\u2019s campaign team can be heard saying at the 0:16 mark: \u201cWe admit that we have lost.\u201d\n\nBut the speaker is referring to Widodo\u2019s losses in two Indonesian provinces, Riau and Bangka Belitung, based on quick count results.\n\nAs the text across the bottom of the two videos says: \u201cFor example, the data in the Riau province and Bangka Belitung province\u201d, a bespectacled man in black sweater can be seen and heard at 0:14 saying: \u201cWe admit that we have lost, but not by a margin as big as what has been claimed by Mr Prabowo.\u201d\n\nThe text across the bottom of both videos says, in full:\n\n\u201cJokowi-Maruf\u2019s TKN rejects the Prabowo-Sandi camp\u2019s real count data.\n\n Jokowi-Maruf\u2019s TKN team rejects the Prabowo camp\u2019s version of the real count data. For example, the data in the Riau province and Bangka Belitung province. The team says the loss of Jokowi-Ma\u2019ruf there is not as big as what has been claimed by the Prabowo camp. Joko Widodo-KH Ma\u2019ruf grabbed 39 per cent of popular votes, while 61 per cent of the votes were in favour of Prabowo-Sandiaga. On the other hand, Prabowo\u2019s camp announced he had grabbed 78.26 per cent.\u201d\n\n\u201cMa\u2019ruf\u201d refers to Widodo\u2019s running mate Ma\u2019ruf Amin, while \u201cSandiaga\u201d is Subianto\u2019s vice presidential candidate, Sandiaga Uno.\n\nAccording to the KPU's official schedule which can be seen here, the official vote count for the 2019 elections will finish on May 22, 2019.", "lang": "en"}
