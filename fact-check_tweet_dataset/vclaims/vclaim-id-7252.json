But none of these things would really be evident by examining the documents that circulated through the staff secretary\u2019s office 15 years ago.\u201d\n\nDurbin: \"In September 2003, the President nominated William Haynes to be a judge on the Fourth Circuit. As General Counsel to the Department of Defense, Mr. Haynes had been the architect of the administration\u2019s discredited detention and interrogation policies. For example, Mr. Haynes recommended that Secretary [Donald] Rumsfeld approve the use of abusive interrogation techniques, like threatening detainees with dogs, forced nudity, and for forcing detainees into painful stress positions. During the 108th Congress, Mr. Haynes\u2019s nomination stalled after his involvement in this scandal came to light. Just this February, the President decided to renominate him. What was your role in the original Haynes nomination and decision to renominate him? And at the time of the nomination, what did you know about Mr. Haynes\u2019s role in crafting the administration\u2019s detention and interrogation policies?\"", "lang": "en"}
