According to the post, the note in which the green strip is closer to Mahatma Gandhi is fake and the note in which the strip is in the middle of the note a real. In our investigation we found that this claim is false.\n\nIn viral post\u2019s description reads: \u201cBeware of Rs 500 currency note\u2026. Pls do not accept Rs.500 currency note if the green strip is close to Gandhi ji because it\u2019s fake. Accept a currency note where the strip is * near Governor\u2019s signature. * Please pass this message to all family and friends \u201c.\n\nTo investigate, we explored the official website of Reserve Bank Of India. The website has a dedicated page to identify counterfeit note from the real ones. But nowhere has it mentioned the position of the green strip.\n\nIn this matter, we wrote an email to RBI and we were told that the position of the green band on the note cannot be the criteria for identifying fake currency. The strip\u2019s position varies. At the same time, the RBI also shared with us a link where the details of how to identify a fake note were given.\n\nThis post was shared by a Facebook user named Napoleon Dias.\n\nConclusion: In our investigation we found that this claim is false. The position of the green band on the note cannot be the criteria for identifying fake currency.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right.
