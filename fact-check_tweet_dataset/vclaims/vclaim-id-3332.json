According to faculty, Keaton entered the school and rode his hoverboard through the hallways.\n\nWhile it is indeed true that Keaton Jones featured in a viral video about being bullied at school and subsequently got an outpouring of support from people and celebrities from all over the world (including substantial donations via a GoFundMe campaign) it is not true that he used the donations to buy luxury items and subsequently got beat up at school.\n\nHere is the video that got it all started:\n\nAfter the initial support there was also a backlash after several of Jones' family members were seen to be posing with confederate flags on Facebook. You can read more about that controversy here. But the part about being beaten up at school after arriving with all his luxury goods supposedly bought with the donations is absolutely false: for one thing the GoFundMe page was frozen after the controversy erupted so the money hasn't actually gotten to him yet (if it ever does).\n\nAnd on top of that Huzlers styles itself as a \"fauxtire\" website and carries a disclaimer at the bottom of each page:\n\nAccording to Splinter News the site is run by Pablo Reyes and David Martinez and according to Buzzfeed Reyes is involved with several other fake news websites. They tend to shy away from political stories, opting instead to write for a more \"urban\" audience, with stories about rappers, criminals and celebrities.\n\nSo don't believe this fake story and don't spread it. A little boy is being victimized and bullied by random people on the internet. No matter what you think of his family, that's just wrong.", "lang": "en"}
