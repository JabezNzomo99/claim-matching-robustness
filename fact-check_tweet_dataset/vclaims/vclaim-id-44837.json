This claim is false; the photo in fact shows a Japanese medical team traveling to Chengdu, China following an earthquake in 2008. The Japanese embassy in Manila also told AFP that reports of a Japanese medical team being sent to Wuhan are \"not true.\"\n\nThe photo, which shows rows of people wearing a vest with the Japanese flag, was shared here on Facebook on February 1, 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post, which has been shared more than 1,800 times:\n\nThe caption states: \u201c1.000 Medical Team from Japan, go to help Wuhan.\u201d\n\nThis image was also shared alongside a similar claim here on Twitter.\n\nSince its emergence in Wuhan in late 2019, the novel coronavirus has killed at least 425 people, including one in the Philippines, and infected over 20,400 people across China, AFP reported here.\n\nHowever, the claim about a Japanese medical team travelling to Wuhan is false.\n\nA reverse image search of the photo in the misleading Facebook post led to this report published on China\u2019s state-run China Internet Information Center. The report is credited to Xinhua news agency and dated May 21, 2008.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the report:\n\nThe photo's caption reads: \u201cMembers of Japanese medical team walk to board at the Narita airport in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, May 20, 2008. A 22 member Japanese medical team flew to Chengdu, capital of the quake-hit southwest China's Sichuan Province on Tuesday.\u201d\n\nA 7.9-magnitude earthquake struck Sichuan on the afternoon of May 12, 2008, killing more than 87,000, AFP reported here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading post (L) and the photo in the China Internet Information Center report (R):\n\nThe same photo was also published in local media reports on the Japanese medical team\u2019s dispatch to China in 2008 here and here.\n\nMoreover, the Embassy of Japan in Manila refuted claims that a Japanese medical team of some 1,000 personnel was sent to provide assistance in Wuhan.\n\n\u201cUpon checking, please be informed that this report is not true,\u201d the embassy told AFP via email on February 3, 2020.", "lang": "en"}
