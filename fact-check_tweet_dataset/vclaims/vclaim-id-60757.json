That was the highest ratio among all states in late 2011.\n\nThe gun control group said in a November 2011 version of its Fatal Gaps report that Virginia had been sharing records with the national background check database for a decade, but the volume of records shared increased after the 2007 Virginia Tech tragedy.\n\nIn that case, Seung-Hui Cho, was able to purchase two handguns he used to kill 32 people despite going through federal and state background checks at licensed gun dealers, according to a 2009 panel on the shooting to then Gov. Tim Kaine.\n\nCho had been deemed a danger to himself by a Virginia court, and that normally would have made him ineligible to buy the weapons. But his information was not shared with the federal National Instant Background Check System, the panel said, because of ambiguities in Virginia\u2019s guns laws.\n\nThe Virginia Tech shootings sparked a nationwide examination of the national background check system. Congress passed a 2008 law providing incentives for states to submit mental health records to the national background check system, but they are under no requirement comply. Virginia also passed legislation expanding the mental health records that have to be sent to the federal and state background check databases.\n\nMayors Against Illegal Guns notes on its interactive that in the wake of the massacre, Virginia became the national leader in submitting mental health records to the national background check system.\n\nIt remained at the top of the group\u2019s list until October 2012, Erika Soto Lamb, a spokeswoman for Mayors Against Illegal Guns, said in an e-mail. Since, then, however, Pennsylvania has vaulted from the bottom of the pack to the top.\n\nThat month, according to the , the Pennsylvania State Police resolved lengthy legal and technical problems and transmitted 643,167 mental health records to the NICS.\n\nThe submission means that Pennsylvania has submitted about 5,003 mental health records to the national background check system per 100,000 residents.\n\nVirginia was a distant No. 2 in the latest report by the mayors\u2019 group, which counts all submissions through Oct. 31, 2012. Virginia had sent 180,338 mental health records to NICS. That breaks down to about 2,220 records per 100,000 residents.\n\nRounding out the Top 5 were Delaware, California and Washington.\n\nThe Bottom 5, in descending order, were Oklahoma, Louisiana, North Dakota, Rhode Island and Massachusetts.\n\nThe gun control group plans to issue an updated report in the coming weeks.\n\nCuccinelli said Virginia is \"the number one state per capita in screening out people with mental illness from gun purchases.\" His claim is based on outdated numbers.\n\nVirginia used to be No.1, but was surpassed by Pennsylvania last year. Now, we\u2019re a distant No. 2. That\u2019s still impressive.\n\nSo Cuccinelli\u2019s statement is largely accurate but needs the clarification. We rate it Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
