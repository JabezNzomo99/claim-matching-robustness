I just hope he never goes into politics. He\u2019d be a disaster.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no record of Mary Anne Trump ever saying the quote.\n\nMary Anne Trump, an immigrant from Scotland, married Fred Trump in 1936. She had five children with him: Maryanne Trump Barry, Fred Trump Jr., Elizabeth Trump Grau, Donald Trump and Robert Trump.\n\nAn image alleges in a post that Mary Anne Trump made a disparaging remark about Donald Trump. It does not give a citation for the quote making the rounds on social media.\n\n\u201cYes, he\u2019s an idiot with zero common sense, and no social skills, but he IS my son,\u201d the Facebook post quotes her as saying. \u201cI just hope he never goes into politics. He\u2019d be a disaster.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Daily Caller News Foundation found no record of Mary Anne Trump ever saying the quote attributed to her in the Facebook post. A search of news archives and interviews didn\u2019t yield any matches. It only seems to appear in memes and social media posts.\n\nOther fact-checkers have also been unable to find any credible sources linking Mary Anne Trump to the quote.
