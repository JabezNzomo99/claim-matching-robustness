Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, \u201cUnder capitalism, man oppresses man. Under socialism, it\u2019s the other way around.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that Ocasio-Cortez ever said this statement.\n\nOcasio-Cortez defeated 10-term incumbent Joe Crowley to represent New York\u2019s 14th congressional district in 2018. A self-described democratic socialist, she is the youngest woman ever elected to Congress.\n\nHer rise to national prominence has made Ocasio-Cortez a popular target for fake quotes, with this particular image apparently created to make her look unintelligent.\n\n\u201cDo not shut this woman up,\u201d reads the caption. \u201cThis sh*t is gold\u2026\u201d (RELATED: Does Ocasio-Cortez Want To Repeal Daylight Saving Time To Combat Climate Change?)\n\nThere is, however, no evidence that Ocasio-Cortez ever said the quote attributed to her in the Facebook post. An internet search reveals no credible sources linking it to her.\n\nFurthermore, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s spokesman Corbin Trent told FactCheck.org last year that the congresswoman never said it.\n\nThe origin of the quote is unknown but, according to etymologist Barry Popik, the earliest two instances date back to 1958, though the wording varies slightly. It appears in a book written by economist John Kenneth Galbraith, who is often credited with authoring it, and in a periodical where the quote is attributed to reporter Henry Shapiro.\n\nIt has also been referred to as an \u201cold Soviet joke\u201d in other sources.", "lang": "en"}
