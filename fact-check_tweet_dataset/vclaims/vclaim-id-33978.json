Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: \u2018Staring girl\u2019 photo taken at Jamia Protests against CAA. Fact: The photo in the post is an old one and was taken in 2016 during a pro-democracy protest in Santiago (Chile). Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the photo was run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found in an article by \u2018The Sun\u2019. In the article, the photo has the following description: \u2018A demonstrator looks at a riot officer during protests in Chile in September 2016\u2019. So, when searched with the relevant keywords, the same photo was also found in a CNN article, published in 2016. So, it is not related to any protests in India.\n\nTo sum it up, 2016 photo taken in Chile is being shared as a photo from Jamia Protests against CAA.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
