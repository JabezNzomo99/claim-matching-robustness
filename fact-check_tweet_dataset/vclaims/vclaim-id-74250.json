Now, a video of jets forming a tricolour in the skies is going viral with the claim that this was how France bid farewell to the Rafales destined for India. The video shows jets emerging from behind a magnificent structure and forming synchronised smoke trails of green, white and red colours.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be false. The video has nothing to do with Rafales and is an old clip of Italy\u2019s Republic Day celebrations in Rome.\n\nThe video with the false claim is being widely circulated on social media. The caption reads, \u201cEveryone talked about Rafael landing in India but see the farewell from France with Indian Tricolors.\u201d The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nUsing InVID tool, we found an article on a Chinese news website \u201cXinhua Net\u201d which says the visuals are from Italy\u2019s Republic Day celebrations in its capital Rome. Several videos of Italy\u2019s R-Day celebrations are available on the Internet, which shows visuals similar to the viral video.\n\nItaly celebrates its Republic Day on June 2 in which its Air Force performs synchronised stunts, forming the Italian tricolour in the skies. The grand building seen in the viral video is Victor Emmanuel II National Monument from where the R-Day parade starts. The Italian national flag can also be seen in the viral video.\n\nIndian and Italian national flags have near-similar colours, due to which social media users often get misled. The Italian flag has vertical pales of green, white and red, and the Indian flag has horizontal pales of saffron, white and green. So when such air shows are performed in the sky, viewers are prone to be misled.\n\nOn July 27, the day the Rafales took off from France, the Indian embassy there tweeted a video of the jets taking off from Merignac airbase in Bordeaux.\n\nThe same video went viral last year as well with the claim that this was how India\u2019s Independence Day was marked in London\u2019s Trafalgar Square. At that time too, AFWA had debunked the claim.\n\nTherefore, it can be said that the video of jets forming a tricolour in the skies has nothing to do with Rafales. This was not how France bid farewell to the jets destined for India as claimed in the viral post. It is an old clipping of Italy\u2019s Republic Day celebrations.", "lang": "en"}
