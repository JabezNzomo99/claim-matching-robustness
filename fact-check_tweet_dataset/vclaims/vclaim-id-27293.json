(More of the segment will air May 1.)\n\n\u2018Pre-existing conditions are in the bill\u2019\n\nWith Republicans in Congress still trying to pass a replacement for Obamacare, Dickerson asked Trump how the latest version protects people who voted for him.\n\nTrump said the latest version ensures that people who are sick can still get coverage:\n\n\"Pre-existing conditions are in the bill. And I just watched another network than yours, and they were saying, \u2018Pre-existing is not covered.\u2019 Pre-existing conditions are in the bill. And I mandate it. I said, \u2018Has to be.\u2019 \"\n\nLater, Trump said, \"When I watch some of the news reports, which are so unfair, and they say we don't cover pre-existing conditions -- we cover it beautifully.\"\n\nThis makes protection for people with pre-existing conditions sound ironclad. But that\u2019s not the case. People with pre-existing conditions could get coverage, but they could be charged higher rates.\n\nThe latest GOP proposal, an amendment from Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., permits states to seek waivers from the health care law. One of the waivers would give states the authority to allow insurers to set premiums based on health status.\n\nThat means insurers could look at people\u2019s current and past health to make predictions about how much medical care they might use in the future.\n\nIn practice, that means states can allow insurers to charge more for people who are sicker but less for people who are healthier.\n\nThere is protection for people who stay insured no matter what. If someone stays insured, insurance companies can\u2019t charge the person more based on his or her health status. But low-income people aren\u2019t always able to stay insured, and health experts told us they\u2019re concerned the poor will end up paying more.\n\nOverall, the proposal could lead to less expensive coverage for younger and healthier people, but more expensive coverage for older or sicker people.

Which part of it is phony?\"\n\nTrump: \"The concept of Russia with respect to us is a total phony story.\"\n\nTrump: \"Of course, it's a total phony story.\"\n\nThat\u2019s minimizing the truth, though. There might not be a vast conspiracy in which Trump is letting Putin pull the strings in the White House. But there is legitimate evidence that Russia meddled in the election, enough to compel the FBI to investigate some of Trump\u2019s associates\u2019 ties to Russia, as well as bipartisan calls for a congressional inquiry.\n\nTrump also tried to redirect attention to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, arguing that his former opponent also had ties to Russia.\n\n\"You have Podesta, who, by the way, I understand has a company with his brother in Russia,\" he said. \"Hillary's husband makes speeches in Russia. Hillary did a uranium deal with Russia. Nobody ever talks about that.\"\n\nWe have looked at similar claims from Trump about Hillary Clinton\u2019s ties to Russia. Trump is giving a one-sided account here.\n\nIn regards to Podesta, Trump was probably referencing Podesta Group, a lobbying and public affairs firm founded in 1988 by brothers John Podesta and Tony Podesta. Public records from 2016 show the U.S.-based Podesta Group was paid $170,000 to represent Sberbank, a Russian bank.\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks about Bill Clinton are in reference to Clinton\u2019s speech for Renaissance Capital, a Russian investment bank. The bank paid Bill Clinton $500,000 in 2010 to deliver a speech, according to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2010 financial disclosure form.\n\nSome critics said the bank was just trying to curry favor with the State Department. But Bill Clinton regularly delivers speeches for fees of $500,000 or higher, and Renaissance Capital regularly invites world leaders to speak at its events.\n\nAnd finally, as secretary of state, Clinton was one of nine federal agency heads to sign off on Russia\u2019s purchase of a controlling stake in Uranium One, an international mining company headquartered in Canada with operations in several U.S. states.\n\nBut even with its control of Uranium One, Russia cannot export the material from the United States. Russia was likely more interested in Uranium One\u2019s assets in Kazakhstan, the world\u2019s largest uranium producer.\n\nThe deal followed established federal rules, and we\u2019ve found no evidence that Hillary Clinton played a special role in the process.\n\nTrump explained why he reversed his promise on labeling China a currency manipulator: China isn\u2019t manipulating its currency now, and Trump wants China\u2019s help in dealing with North Korea.\n\nThis marked a major departure from Trump\u2019s rhetoric during the campaign regarding China, in which he called the nation out for \"outrageous theft\" and illegal product dumping. He pledged to brand the country a currency manipulator once he was elected. With Trump now on the record as saying the Chinese are \"not currency manipulators,\" we rated this Promise Broken.\n\nTrump seemed to acknowledge the reversal, connecting it to China\u2019s help with North Korea.\n\n\"I think that, frankly, North Korea is maybe more important than trade,\" Trump said. \"Trade is very important. But massive warfare with millions, potentially millions of people being killed? That, as we would say, trumps trade.\"\n\nTrump said he \"will not be happy\" if North Korea conducts another nuclear test, but didn\u2019t clarify whether the United States would take military action if it happens. He did suggest that China\u2019s president was on the same page about North Korea's recent missile tests.\n\n\"And I will tell you, a man that I've gotten to like and respect \u2014 the president of China, President Xi \u2014 I believe has been putting pressure on him also,\" Trump said.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump said with North Korea, no one has ever seen such a positive response from China on America\u2019s behalf. That\u2019s at least partially accurate. China has taken many steps over the decades to manage North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions, but there\u2019s no clear consensus on whether its recent actions are unprecedented.\n\u2022 Trump claimed there was weak economic growth in Obama\u2019s last term, claiming that GDP was only 1.6 percent. That figure is accurate but doesn't tell the full story. There are numbers of historical vagaries that color what affects GDP during any administration. No president has full control of the economic growth that happens under his watch.\n\u2022 Continuing to cite an ongoing audit, Trump gave no indication that he would be releasing his tax returns anytime soon. It\u2019s hard to know how Trump would personally benefit from his tax cut proposals. House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi said that his tax breaks would have cut his taxes by $30 million in 2005, a claim we rated Mostly True.\n\u2022 Trump said he would continue trade negotiations with Mexico and Canada regarding NAFTA, as opposed to entirely pulling out of the agreement. His campaign promise to renegotiate it remains In the Works.", "lang": "en"}
