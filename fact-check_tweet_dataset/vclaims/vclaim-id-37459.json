Read The New Indian Express' article on Blair's AP visit here.\n\nAlso, while the twitter handle Tony Blair Institute tweeted excerpts of Blair's speech at Raisina Dialogue, no mention was made about the former PM meeting Gandhi.\n\nThe Tony Blair Institute for Global Change is a non-profit organisation founded by Blair. The handle handle tweets about programmes attended by him.\n\nTony Blair was prime minister from 1997 to 2007.\n\nBOOM also looked for other news articles which mentioned Blair and Gandhi. We found a news article from News18 dated March 21, 2008 when the channel was called 'CNN IBN'. 'Blair endorses Rahul Gandhi, calls him PM material' (archived link)\n\nIn an interview to CNN IBN's Vidya Shankar Aiyar Tony Blair was reported to have said, \"I think he (Rahul) is one of the most talented, able and insightful of the younger generation of politicians worldwide, but how he ends up in your politics again, that's for you, for him and for his party to decide. But I think he has got first class mind and great commitment to India.\"\n\nHowever, the recent statement claimed by Viral In India in 2019 does not appear anywhere else online besides its own Facebook page.\n\nBOOM's Hindi website has fact-checked Viral In India for posting fake posts and articles several times in the past as well.
