Like her, let\u2019s not ask what my dad can do for us, let\u2019s ask what we can do for my dad\u201d:\n\nIvanka did tweet, on May 22, 2020, about a girl in India who cycled her wounded father about 750 miles because other forms of transportation had been shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\nIvanka\u2019s tweet also triggered a fair amount of scorn from critics who contended she had missed the point of the anecdote:\n\nFirst daughter Ivanka Trump drew harsh criticism in India after tweeting support for an impoverished girl who cycled her wounded father some 1,200 kilometers, or roughly 750 miles, amid the COVID-19 lockdown transport shutdown. Jyoti Kumari carried her her wounded father \u2014 who lost his rickshaw job after suffering an injury \u2014 on the back of her bicycle for seven days to their family village because he was running out of food and money where he was working in northern India. The pair slept rough and survived on handouts during their journey. But human rights advocates, including former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Omar Abdullah, said the president\u2019s daughter missed the point. \u201cHer poverty & desperation are being glorified as if Jyoti cycled 1,200 KM for the thrill of it,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cGovernment failed her, that\u2019s hardly something to trumpet as an achievement.\u201d\n\nHowever, Ivanka did not follow that reference by invoking former President John F. Kennedy\u2019s famous 1961 inaugural address in asserting, \u201clet\u2019s not ask what my dad can do for us, let\u2019s ask what we can do for my dad.\u201d The wording of the putative quote reproduced in the above meme was taken from a Tucker Carlson parody account on Twitter, @SuckerCarlson:", "lang": "en"}
