A mixed crowd of young and old heard Yang explain how automation had permanently displaced millions of workers. Yang said this laid the groundwork for Donald Trump\u2019s victory in 2016.\n\n\"There's a straight lineup between the adoption of industrial automation in a voting area and the movement to Trump in that area,\" Yang said Feb. 5.\n\nOne of Yang\u2019s key proposals starts with recognizing the value of the personal data held by tech giants such as Amazon, Facebook and Google. And then taxing them in order to share some of that value with all Americans in the form of a universal basic income, a monthly check to every American.\n\nVoter Nina King, of Bellows Falls, Vt., said Yang\u2019s message resonated with her.\n\n\"I like that he said we need to focus on the problems that got Donald Trump elected in the first place, and he said that absolutely nobody else is talking about that, and I agree,\" King said.\n\nPolitiFact is traveling through New Hampshire this week to fact-check Democratic candidates ahead of the state\u2019s Feb. 11 primary.\n\nRELATED: We analyzed the stump speeches of Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\nWe fact-checked several of Yang\u2019s statements in Keene, here\u2019s a recap.\n\n\"Right now corporate profits are heading up and life expectancy is trending down\"\n\nThis is no longer quite accurate. Life expectancy did decline between 2014 and 2017. Yang said the last time America saw that kind of drop was during the 1918 Spanish Flu. But just released data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that life expectancy ticked up by 0.1 year between 2017 and 2018. It is now back where it stood in 2015, 78.7 years.\n\nThat is still two tenths of a year less than in 2014, but the decline Yang described has reversed slightly. According to the CDC, the two leading reasons for the change are lower numbers of deaths from cancer and unintentional injuries, a category that includes drug overdoses.\n\nAs for corporate profits heading up, that\u2019s broadly accurate. In raw dollars, they are near record highs. And as a percentage of gross domestic income, they have ticked up recently, although they have remained in the 4% to 8% range for decades.\n\n\"Only 5% of Americans today donate to political candidates or campaigns.\"\n\nThis is Mostly True. Yang was citing an online poll in June that found 8% of Americans said they had given to a 2020 presidential candidate. Pew Research looked at what people told pollsters after the 2016 election and found that 12% said they donated, but that wasn\u2019t limited to federal candidates.\n\nSo Yang is in the ballpark, but his number might be a bit low.\n\nSpeaking of universal basic income, \"Thomas Paine was for it at the founding of our country, called it the citizens dividend for all Americans. Martin Luther King, whose birthday we just celebrated, was fighting for this in 1968, it was what he was fighting for when he was killed\u2026 It was so mainstream it passed the U.S. House of Representatives twice in 1971 under Richard Nixon.\"\n\nThis is Mostly True.\n\nPaine\u2019s proposal in the 1790s pamphlet Agrarian Justice was in some ways an early version of the Social Security program and had an element of universal basic income. Paine proposed a one-time payment of 15 pounds to every person when they turned 21 years old; and favored paying people 10 pounds annually for the rest of their lives starting at age 50. His proposal, inspired by the French Revolution, was published about two decades after the founding of the United States in 1776.\n\nIt is true that King supported a guaranteed income in his 1967 book, \"Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?\" But he wasn\u2019t explicitly advocating for it on the day he was killed.\n\nThe House in 1970 and 1971 (not twice in 1971) passed bills that experts say were as close as the U.S. has come to passing something resembling a universal basic income.\n\nYang\u2019s Freedom Dividend plan is a form of universal basic income, guaranteeing $1,000 a month to every U.S. citizen over 18 years old, without having to pass a test or meet a work requirement.\n\nSays \"30% of our stores and malls\" are closing because of Amazon.\n\nOnline retailers, including Amazon, certainly have had an impact on sales at brick-and-mortar locations, but Yang\u2019s claim needs context.\n\nE-commerce sales as a percentage of all sales has been growing for years. Meanwhile, consulting firm CoStar in 2018 reported that by August of that year, retail stores had shuttered a record number of square feet, even before the full 12-month period was over. And some analysts have predicted that the number of malls will fall by 25% or 30% within the next few years.\n\nSome sectors (including automotive, appliances and hardware) remain relatively impervious to online sales, even as others (such as toys, entertainment and books) have deteriorated.\n\nThe National Retail Federation in an April 2019 blog post also said that once-online-only retailers such as Amazon are now opening brick-and-mortar stores. It\u2019s estimated that brands that were formerly only online will open 850 brick-and-mortar stores over the next five years, the trade group said.\n\n\"There are 200 counties in the United States that do not have any local news source at all.\"\n\nThis is grounded in data. Research by UNC School of Media and Journalism\u2019s Center for Innovation and Sustainability in Local Media and published in a 2018 report found that there were around 200 counties in the United States without any newspaper, weekly or daily, \"creating a news vacuum for about 3.2 million residents and public officials in those counties.\"\n\nRELATED: Fact-checking Bernie Sanders in Milford, New Hampshire before the primary", "lang": "en"}
