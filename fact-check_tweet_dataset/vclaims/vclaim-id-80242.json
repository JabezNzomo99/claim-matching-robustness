A transcript and footage of the interview show Curry did not speak about Duterte nor use the term \u2018killing president\u2019.\n\nThe post said Curry made the comments during an interview with CNN\u2019s Van Jones.\n\nA headline in the post states: \u201cStephen Curry opens up about Duterte feud\u201d.\n\nIt then says: \u201cNBA star Stephen Curry sits down with CNN\u2019s Van Jones to talk about President Duterte tweeting that Curry was not invited to the Malacanang Palace.\u201d\n\nThe text about Duterte is under this image:\n\nA reverse image search shows the image is a screengrab taken from an interview that Curry did with Van Jones on February 24, 2018. The screengrab comes five seconds into an excerpt of the interview posted on Youtube.\n\nIn the screengrab and the CNN video, Curry wears the same distinctive plaid jacket and is seated across from Jones. Blue lighting and a horse head statue are also visible in the background of of the video and screengrab.\n\nIn the excerpt of the interview posted on Youtube, Curry did not say anything about Filipinos being \u201cstupid\u201d and Duterte, nor did he use the words \u201ckilling president\u201d.\n\nA transcript of the full interview is available here on CNN\u2019s website.\n\nThat transcript shows Curry did not speak about Duterte nor talk about the Philippines in any way. It also shows he did not use the term \u201ckilling president\u201d.\n\nCurry\u2019s interview with Van Jones made headlines because the basketballer spoke about his feud with American President Donald Trump.\n\nThe interview posted on Youtube carried the headline: \u201cStephen Curry opens up about Trump feud\u201d.\n\nThe false post copied that headline, except it replaced \u201cTrump\u201d with Duterte\u201d.\n\nSince becoming president in the middle of 2016, Duterte has waged a crackdown on drugs that has left thousands of people dead.\n\nRights groups allege police have conducted widespread abuses in the crackdown, including murdering drug users and addicts.\n\nThe International Criminal Court is conducting a preliminary investigation into allegations of extra-judicial killings and other crimes in the war on drugs.\n\nDuterte, who took office in the middle of 2016, insists he is conducting his drug war properly and surveys show widespread support among Filipinos.\n\nThe post on the website about Curry has been shared to nearly 600,000 people on Facebook, mostly by groups that support Duterte or one of his political allies, boxer-turned-senator Manny Pacquiao, according to data from social media monitoring platform CrowdTangle.\n\nComments on some of the Facebook pages that shared the false post indicated many people believed Curry made the comments and expressed anger at the basketballer. Some threatened him.\n\nBelow is a snapshot of comments in reaction to the post on the Sen. Manny Pacquiao Trending News Today Facebook page.", "lang": "en"}
