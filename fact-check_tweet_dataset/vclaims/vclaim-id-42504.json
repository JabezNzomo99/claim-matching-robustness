The notice being shared on Facebook has been fabricated.\n\nSome doughnut and coffee lovers might have been alarmed to hear the rumor that Dunkin\u2019 would be shuttering all of its more than 11,300 locations worldwide to help curb the spread of coronavirus. The claim appears to originate with a notice letter that has been making the rounds on social media platforms.\n\n\u201cTo prevent the spread of COVID-19, all Dunkin\u2019 locations will be closed for business starting March 18, 2020 until further notice,\u201d reads the alleged notice. \u201cThank you for your patience and understanding.\u201d\n\nBut, according to a Dunkin\u2019 spokesperson, the notice is fake, and the chain has no plans to close its restaurants on March 18.

We and our franchisees are here to keep our guests running.\u201d\n\nDunkin\u2019 is one of numerous chains that have pivoted to take-out, drive-through and delivery only to follow the recommendation from public health officials to practice social distancing. Other chains who have adopted these service practices include McDonald\u2019s, KFC and Chick-fil-A, according to Business Insider.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
