Lamar Smith said climate change \u201calarmists\u201d ignore the \u201cpositive impacts\u201d of more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, such as increased food production and quality. But the impact of increased CO levels on agriculture is more complicated than that \u2014 and, on balance, likely negative, particularly in the future.\n\nOther factors aside, an atmosphere with more CO does boost crop yield in the short term via increased rates of photosynthesis. In the long term, multiple experts told us the positive effect of increased CO on crops will diminish and the negative impacts of climate change, such as higher temperatures and extreme rainfall, will grow.\n\nSmith, the chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space & Technology, made his claim in a July 24 op-ed published in the Daily Signal, a news website created by the conservative Heritage Foundation.\n\nIn making his claim, Smith also argued, \u201cThe American people should be made aware of both the negative and positive impacts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,\u201d adding, \u201cWithout the whole story, how can we expect an objective evaluation of the issues involving climate change?\u201d\n\nWe agree. Below, we take a look at both the pros and cons of increased CO on agriculture.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at Smith\u2019s claims one by one. First, does a \u201chigher concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere \u2026 aid photosynthesis, which in turn contributes to increased plant growth,\u201d as Smith said?\n\nYes, but to a point.\n\nDuring photosynthesis, plants use energy from sunlight to convert CO and water into oxygen and glucose, a sugar molecule. Plants then release oxygen from their leaves, but they also combine oxygen with glucose to produce energy for growth through a different process called respiration.\n\nThe United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s 2014 report does say that increased atmospheric CO has \u201cvirtually certainly enhanced [crop] water use efficiency and yields.\u201d So, Smith is right that more CO leads to more photosynthesis, which correlates to increased crop yields. And he\u2019s also right that \u201c[s]tudies indicate that crops would utilize water more efficiently\u201d in an atmosphere with more CO .\n\nBut the IPCC adds that the CO effect has a greater impact on wheat and rice, than on corn and sugarcane.\n\nPhotosynthesis in wheat and rice relies more on CO in the atmosphere, while corn and sugarcane rely more on \u201cinternal cycling\u201d during photosynthesis, Jerry Hatfield, the director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s National Laboratory for Agriculture and The Environment, explained to us over the phone.\n\nIn other words, increased CO doesn\u2019t boost crop yield equally across the board.\n\nHatfield, who was also part of the IPCC process that received the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize and who currently serves on an IPCC special committee, also explained to us that the positive impacts of CO may \u201creach a point of diminishing return,\u201d or \u201csaturation,\u201d in the future. What does that mean?\n\nRight now, the concentration of CO in the atmosphere is just over 400 parts per million, according to NASA. (For comparison, before 1950, the level of CO hadn\u2019t surpassed 300 ppm for hundreds of thousands of years.)\n\nHatfield told us that plants would reach CO saturation at around 550 to 600 ppm, at which point more gas \u201cwon\u2019t be as beneficial.\u201d\n\nIn an email, Frances Moore, an assistant professor studying climate change\u2019s impact on agriculture at the University of California, Davis, put it this way: \u201cMy research does show that higher CO2 concentrations are beneficial to crops, but this effect quickly declines at higher and higher concentrations because plant growth becomes limited by other nutrients.\u201d\n\nHigher levels of CO wouldn\u2019t necessarily be harmful to crops, added Hatfield. Still, \u201cwe know so little about the effects of super high concentrations of CO on plant growth,\u201d he said.\n\nAt an increase of 3 ppm per year, the rate in 2015 and 2016, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Earth would reach saturation well before the end of the century. Since 1960, the rate has fluctuated, so it could decrease, but the trend generally shows an increasing rate.\n\nIn his op-ed, Smith also said increased CO correlates to \u201cbetter quality food.\u201d We reached out to his office to get some clarification on what the chairman meant by \u201cbetter quality.\u201d\n\nAlicia Criscuolo, a press assistant for the House science committee, told us by email, \u201cChairman Smith uses \u2018quality\u2019 as a term to encompass a wide range of benefits,\u201d such as a \u201crise in production and size of plants grown in a CO enhanced environment\u201d and an \u201cincreased concentration of vitamin C that results from increased CO exposure.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, his office pointed us to two papers, one about strawberries and another concerning sour oranges.\n\nThe paper about strawberries, published in Photosynthesis Research in 2001, didn\u2019t exactly conclude that increased CO \u201cleads to an increase in biomass and overall production of strawberries,\u201d as Criscuolo said in an email to us.\n\nRather, the study, authored by USDA collaborator James A. Bunce, investigated how other factors, such as temperature and soil quality, affected a strawberry plant\u2019s propensity to increase its photosynthesis rate in an environment with elevated CO levels. While the study did show that strawberries photosynthesize more with increased CO levels, it didn\u2019t look at strawberry quantity or quality.\n\nThe paper about sour oranges, published in the journal Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment in June 2002, found that when a 75 percent increase in CO levels \u2014 from 400 ppm to 700 ppm \u2014 doubles fruit production, it also increases the vitamin C concentration of the fruit\u2019s juice by 7 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note two things about this study. First, its primary author, Sherwood B. Idso, is the president of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, a nonprofit that denies that increased CO causes global warming. Second, sour oranges shouldn\u2019t be confused with juicing oranges. Sour oranges are mostly used to make marmalade.\n\nWe also asked Samuel S. Myers, a senior research scientist at Harvard studying the human health impacts of climate change, what he thought of the idea that increased atmospheric CO will lead to \u201cbetter quality food,\u201d as Smith said.\n\n\u201cRep. Smith\u2019s claim about better quality food is pure fabrication,\u201d he told us by email. \u201cAll our research shows that rising concentrations of CO reduce the nutritional value of staple food crops,\u201d such as wheat, barley and rice. \u201cWe have shown \u2026 that staple food crops lose significant amounts of iron, zinc, and protein (critical nutrients for human health) when grown in open-field conditions\u201d at elevated CO levels, he said, though scientists aren\u2019t sure why increased CO leads to decreased nutrients in staple crops.\n\nIn fact, earlier this month, Myers and colleagues published a paper in Environmental Health Perspectives that found that \u201can additional 1.6% or 148.4 million of the world\u2019s population may be placed at risk of protein deficiency\u201d because of elevated CO levels.\n\nIn his op-ed, Smith also claimed that, due to increased CO , \u201ccolder areas along the farm belt will experience longer growing seasons.\u201d This is true, but warmer regions, such as the southern states, will also experience negative effects because of climate change.\n\nTo support his claim, Smith\u2019s office pointed us to a June 2014 paper in Nature by Melissa Reyes-Fox, a technician at the USDA, and others. The paper explains that scientists have previously found evidence to suggest that global warming has caused a lengthening of the growing season in temperate and polar regions of the Earth.\n\nReyes-Fox and her group found that a longer growing season, especially when water is a limiting factor, \u201cis not due to warming alone, but also to higher atmospheric CO concentrations.\u201d However, the researchers didn\u2019t look at food crops, but a grassland in Wyoming.\n\nStill, the IPCC\u2019s 2014 report does say with \u201chigh confidence that warming has benefitted crop production in some high-latitude regions, such as northeast China or the UK,\u201d and that \u201chigh-latitude locations will, in general, become more suitable for crops.\u201d This is due, in part, to the fact that \u201cdeclines in frost occurrence will lead to longer growing seasons,\u201d the report says.\n\nHowever, this \u201clatitudinal expansion of cold-climate cropping zones polewards \u2026 may be largely offset by reductions in cropping production in the mid-latitudes as a result of rainfall reduction and temperature increase,\u201d the IPCC adds. \u201cFor tropical systems where moisture availability or extreme heat rather than frost limits the length of the growing season, there is a likelihood that the length of the growing season and overall suitability for crops will decline.\u201d\n\nFewer frost days may also negatively impact fruit and nut trees, Hatfield, at the USDA, told us. The IPCC and the U.S. Global Change Program make similar conclusions in their reports.\n\nThe Global Change report explains, for example, that fruit and nut trees \u201chave a winter chilling requirement,\u201d or a number of hours a year where temperatures are between 32 and 50 degrees F, ranging from 200 to 2,000 hours depending on the type of tree. These temperatures signal fruiting trees to develop flower buds in the spring.\n\nBut not all crops and not all regions will be affected in the same way.\n\n\u201cProjections show that chilling requirements for fruit and nut trees in California will not be met by the middle to the end of this century,\u201d the Global Change report says. However, the report adds that scientists expect apples in the Northeast to have sufficient chilling hours for the rest of the century, though this might not be the case for plums and cherries in the region.\n\nThe IPCC report also points out, \u201cSeveral studies have projected negative yield impacts of climate trends for perennial trees, including apples in eastern Washington \u2026 and cherries in California \u2026 although CO increases may offset some or all of these losses.\u201d\n\nThe projections for wine and coffee are even less favorable. Increasing temperatures associated with rising CO emissions are likely to reduce the area suitable for grapes used to produce the highest-quality wines \u201cby more than 50% by late this century,\u201d the Global Change report says. And coffee production in Costa Rica, Nicaragua and El Salvador \u201cwill be reduced by more than 40%,\u201d according to the IPCC report.\n\nSmith didn\u2019t address how changes in rainfall might affect agriculture in the future. But all the experts we spoke with emphasized the importance of reliable water availability, in addition to temperature and CO , for crop production and quality. For this reason, it\u2019s worth outlining how climate change will change precipitation patterns.\n\nFirst, as we\u2019ve written before, scientists are more confident when linking temperature-related weather to global warming than they are linking precipitation changes to global warming. But there is still plenty of evidence to suggest global warming will affect rainfall patterns across the globe.\n\nHatfield, at the USDA, explained to us that crops generally prefer steady rainfall during the summer, when the most growth occurs. But climate change, due to increased CO , is causing the U.S. to see more precipitation in the form of spring storms.\n\nThe Global Change report also makes a note of this.\n\nThe Midwest, for example, is seeing \u201cincreasing intensity of storms and the shifting of rainfall patterns toward more spring precipitation,\u201d the report says. In Iowa in particular, there hasn\u2019t been an increase in total precipitation per year, but there has been a \u201clarge increase in the number of days with heavy rainfall,\u201d the report adds.\n\nExtreme rainfall is bad for crops for a number of reasons, one being that it leads to soil erosion. During these weather events, the nutrients from the soil are washed away into nearby lakes and rivers, polluting them. The extreme rainfall then leaves the soil less capable of supporting crop growth, the Global Change report adds.\n\nYet More Cons to CO\n\nIncreased CO can also negatively impact crop production by disproportionately benefiting weeds, says Global Change report. Hatfield explained to us that weeds are genetically diverse and, as a result, can adapt to changing environments. Crops, on the other hand, are, by default, inbred and genetically uniform. For this reason, they aren\u2019t as adaptable to changing environments.\n\nThere are also other negative effects of burning fossil fuels \u2014 such as an increase in ground-level ozone, which hinders photosynthesis and other important plant functions, as the IPCC explains in its report. \u201cThis results in stunted crop plants, inferior crop quality, and decreased yields \u2026 and poses a growing threat to global food security,\u201d the report adds.\n\nOverall, every expert we spoke with said the net impact of CO and climate change will leave crop production and quality worse off in the future, not better.\n\nFor example, Myers, at Harvard, told us, \u201cWhile there may be a small fertilization effect of elevated CO on plant growth, this increase will be more than offset by climate change which is causing increased temperatures, changes in precipitation, and complex changes in agricultural pests, pathogens and pollinators.\u201d\n\nMoore, at the University of California, Davis, also told us: \u201cConsidering just CO fertilization and the effect of higher temperatures, we find that at very small amounts of warming (i.e. one degree C) the net effect might be a slight increase in crop yields.\u201d (Since 1880, the Earth has warmed nearly 1 degrees C already, according to NASA.)\n\nBut Moore added that \u201cat higher levels of warming, the negative effect of higher temperatures rapidly comes to dominate the positive effect of CO fertilization, causing crop yields to decline markedly, including in the United States.\u201d And that doesn\u2019t even take into account other negative effects, such as \u201cdisruptive rainfall patterns\u201d and benefits to weeds, she said.\n\nSo Smith is right that there are some positive sides to increased CO in the atmosphere, but the net impact is likely negative, especially in the future.", "lang": "en"}
