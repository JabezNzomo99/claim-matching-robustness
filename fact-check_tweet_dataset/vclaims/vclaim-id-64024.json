(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nObama urged people watching the convention to vote \u2014 her necklace even said it \u2014 and, of course, she made a case for the Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden. But she mentioned neither riots nor violence in her speech.\n\nAfter listing Biden\u2019s aims for education, health care and climate change, Obama said, \"Joe Biden wants all our kids, no matter what they look like, to be able to walk out the door without worrying about being harassed or arrested or killed. He wants all our kids to be able to go to a movie or a math class without being afraid of getting shot. He wants all our kids to grow up with leaders who won\u2019t just serve themselves and their wealthy peers but will provide a safety net for people facing hard times.\"\n\n\"If we want a chance to pursue any of these goals, any of these most basic requirements for a functioning society,\" Obama said, \"we have to vote for Joe Biden in numbers that cannot be ignored.\"\n\nThat\u2019s a far cry from the statement attributed to Obama in the Facebook post.\n\nSearching for the quote online, we only found other social media posts \u2014 no news reports or original sources corroborating this attribution. Looking in the Nexis news archive, there were no articles or news broadcasts relating that Obama said this.", "lang": "en"}
