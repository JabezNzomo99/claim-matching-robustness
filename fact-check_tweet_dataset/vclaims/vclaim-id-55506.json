This is false; Morneau and Lucki\u2019s husband are not cousins, the RCMP and the finance minister\u2019s campaign team told AFP.\n\nIt all began in late August, when Twitter users began to assert that the RCMP\u2019s Lucki is married to a relative of the finance minister, a man named Ray Gauthier.\n\nAccording to this rumor, the kinship between the RCMP boss and the Liberal minister is the reason why Canada\u2019s top police agency did not investigate the Liberal government\u2019s handling of the SNC-Lavalin corruption scandal, which caused controversy in Canada in early 2019.\n\nIt was revealed in February 2019 that Prime Minister Trudeau and his inner circle had attempted to pressure his justice minister into avoiding a trial on corruption charges for the Quebec based construction company.\n\nThe false connection quickly spread across other social media platforms, was converted into easily-shared memes, and was repeated thousands of times by the first week of the federal election campaign.\n\nThe earliest instance of the hoax that AFP FactCheck found was a tweet from the morning of August 26, when Twitter user @Cangal48 pointed out Lucki and Morneau\u2019s family ties in response to a tweet from the now-suspended account @bgirl0001.\n\nThe rumor is untrue, official sources told AFP.\n\nCommissioner Lucki is indeed married to a retired RCMP sergeant named Ray Gauthier, but he is unrelated to Morneau.\n\n\u201cWe have confirmed and the Commissioner\u2019s husband is not related to Finance Minister Bill Morneau,\u201d Sergeant Caroline Duval of the RCMP told AFP in an email.\n\n\u201cThese allegations are false,\u201d Sharan Kaur, Morneau\u2019s campaign manager also told AFP. \u201cThis is another example of misinformation being purposely shared during the election campaign,\u201d she added.", "lang": "en"}
