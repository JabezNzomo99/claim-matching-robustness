So, it is truly very redeeming feature and satisfying for me that Prime Minister\u2019s vision particularly to take electricity to every home, particularly to make electricity access very easy, particularly to make energy affordable is being furthered very rapidly,\u201d Goyal was reported to have said.\n\nA day later, MyGovIndia tweeted the following info-graphic which the minister retweeted.\n\nAn email to MyGovIndia from BOOM seeking a clarification of data went unanswered.\n\nBOOM tried to reach the minister and his office directly on Twitter but did not get a response.\n\n\u2018GETTING ELECTRICITY\u2019 IS NOT THE SAME AS \u2018ELECTRICITY ACCESS\u2019\n\nBOOM found that the 2017 ranking of 26 cited by the minister and the info-graphic is that of the \u2018Getting Electricity\u2019 indicator of the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business Report, 2017.\n\nA clarification from the World Bank to BOOM helps explain the difference.\n\n\u201cIndeed, India got ranked #26 on the Getting Electricity indicator in the Doing Business 2017 report. But the Getting Electricity indicator does not measure universal electricity access for all of the population in the country, and rankings from different years cannot be directly compared because of the methodology change from one year to another,\u201d Elena Karaban, Senior Communication Officer, South Asia, World Bank, wrote.\n\n\u201cThe Getting Electricity indicator does not measure electricity accessibility of the general population. For instance, the affordability of tariffs or percentage of households connected to the grid are not measured,\u201d Karaban citing a clarification from the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business team, wrote.\n\nWORLD BANK MEASURES \u2018POWER FOR BUSINESS\u2019 AND NOT \u2018POWER FOR ALL\u2019\n\nIn its Doing Business rankings, the World Bank only measures the ease at which a local business can obtain a formal electricity connection.\n\nThe government\u2019s usage of the line \u2018power for all\u2019 obfuscates its meaning as it leads the reader to believe it means power for everyone in the literal sense. Moreover, \u2018Power For All\u2019 is a government initiative that includes industries, commercial entities and households.\n\nThe Power For All initiative was launched by the Centre in June 2014 to provide 24X7 electricity to all at an affordable price by 2018 \u2013 2019. The objectives of which include:\n\u2022 Ensure reliable 24X7 supply of electricity to all consumers which include industries and commercial entities and households.\n\u2022 Supply adequate electricity to farmers for irrigation which shall be for 8-10 hours\n\nWHERE THE GOVERNMENT CONTRADICTS ITSELF\n\nBOOM found a notice dated May 4, 2017 on the power ministry\u2019s official website quoting similar data but a side-by-side comparison with MyGovIndia\u2019s info-graphic shows how the two contradict each other.\n\nUnlike the info-graphic, the notice specifies that the rankings are for \u2018getting electricity\u2019 in the doing business report. They also differ with respect to the base year used in comparison (2014 in the info-graphic and 2015 in the notice).\n\nThe World Bank\u2019s Doing Business (DB) team says since the inception of the annual DB report there have been several methodology expansions and as a result the scope of what is being measured by an indicator today is broader than what was measured in earlier reports.\n\nTherefore a historical year-over-year comparison of India\u2019s ranking in either \u2018getting electricity\u2019 or the overall DB ranking would not be right as individual indicators of what is being measured have undergone changes over the years.\n\nIndia ranked 130 among 190 countries on World Bank\u2019s Ease of Doing Business rankings for 2017 released last year. (2016)\n\nSince coming to power in May 2014, Narendra Modi\u2019s government has made an aggressive bid to improve India\u2019s DB ranking as it wants to seal its image as a business-friendly government in the eyes of global investors.\n\nWHERE THE POWER MINISTRY GETS IT RIGHT\n\nThe World Bank acknowledged strides made by the Modi government in its electrification efforts.\n\n\u201cThe past three years\u2019 major reforms have included reforms in the Getting Electricity topic. The utilities in both Mumbai and Delhi have actively reduced the delays and processes required for firms to obtain new electricity connections. In Delhi, it took 138 days to obtain a new connection in 2013, compared to 45 days today,\u201d World Bank\u2019s Doing Business team, said.", "lang": "en"}
