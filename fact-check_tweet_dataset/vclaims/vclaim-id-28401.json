His name is Arvind and he belongs to a special investigation unit of Delhi Police. With the help of TOI reporter Somreet Bhattacharya, we got in touch with a senior police official who refuted the claim that the man in question is an ABVP member. Arvind, in the photo, is seen wearing a normal helmet and not a police head gear.The officer said that Arvind is from the Anti Auto Theft Squad (AATS) of Delhi Police, a special investigation unit, and those in this team are usually in civilian clothes due to 'operational reasons'.Arvind is not the cop seen in the viral video showing a few policemen thrashing a student near JMI University.The social media users are mistaking Arvind for Bharat Sharma, who, as per his Facebook bio, is an ABVP state executive member.The other policeman in question, the one who was actually among the cops who thrashed the student as seen in the viral video, is indeed a Delhi cop. Talking to Times Fact Check, DCP Chinmoy Biswal confirmed the man in the photo above is a Delhi Police personnel and said that he was asked to be in civilian clothes.These are three different people.Times Fact Check has found the claim made by many social media users that an ABVP/RSS member disguised himself as a Delhi Police personnel to be false.", "lang": "en"}
