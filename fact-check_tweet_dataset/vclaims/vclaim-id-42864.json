The claim is false; the WHO denied issuing the report; as of May 2020, health experts have said there is no scientific evidence to suggest that a vegetarian diet prevents infection from COVID-19.\n\nThe claim was made in a text graphic published on Facebook here on March 14, 2020.\n\nThe Hindi text translates to English as: \"Not a single vegetarian has contracted coronavirus in the entire world: WHO Report. Amazing Sanatana Dharma. Hail Hindutva.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe terms \"Sanatana Dharma\" and \"Hindutva\" both refer to aspects of Hinduism, which promotes a vegetarian diet.\n\nSimilar claims were also shared on Facebook here, here, here and here; and on Twitter here, here, here and here.\n\nALSO READ: Fake News In The Time Of Coronavirus: A BOOM Study\n\nHowever, the claim is false.\n\n\"The WHO has not made such a statement,\" Supriya Bezbaruah, the WHO's India representative, told AFP via WhatsApp on May 2, 2020.\n\nDr R.V. Asokan, the secretary-general of the Indian Medical Association, also refuted the claim about vegetarians being protected against COVID-19.\n\n\"There is absolutely no truth in this claim. There is no medical evidence that non-vegetarian food is in any way related to COVID death susceptibility,\" he told AFP by phone on May 5, 2020.\n\nSince the COVID-19 outbreak first emerged in early 2020, health experts have stressed that people should maintain a healthy diet to avoid a weakened immune system due to poor nutrition.\n\nThe WHO states here and here that meat, if properly prepared, can be consumed during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "lang": "en"}
