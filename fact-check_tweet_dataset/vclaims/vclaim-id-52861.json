The posts were published after protests were held across the US over the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis in May 2020. The video has been shared in a misleading context; the footage has circulated in reports since 2013 about an incident in California.\n\n\n\nThe video was published here on Facebook on June 4, 2020. It has been viewed more than 25,000 times.\n\nThe 43-second clip shows a dog approaching uniformed police officers after they detained a black man on the street. One police officer is then seen shooting the dog dead with his gun.\n\nThe post's Sinhala-langA20uage caption translates to English as: \"Situation in America today / The way a dog that came forward on behalf of its master was killed.\"\n\nThe post was published after protests broke out across the US over the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. His death also sparked global protests against racism and police brutality, as reported here by AFP.\n\nThe video was also shared here and here alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is misleading; the video has circulated since 2013 in reports about an incident in California.\n\nA reverse image search on Google using video keyframes extracted with InVID-WeVerify, a digital verification tool, found part of the video published in this July 1, 2013 report by the US television channel, NBC Los Angeles.\n\nThe article is titled: \"Video Shows Hawthorne Police Killing Dog While Arresting Owner.\"\n\nIt reads, in part: \"An officer shot and killed a Southern California man's dog after it jumped from an open car window and lunged at officers who were taking the Rottweiler's owner into custody on suspicion of interfering with a SWAT stand-off.\n\n\"The Hawthorne Police Department statement continued, \"Fearing that the attacking Rottweiler would imminently bite the officer(s), one officer fired his duty weapon several times, striking and killing the dog.\"\n\nThe clip in the misleading Facebook video corresponds, in part, to the NBC Los Angeles video at the 17-second mark and the one-minute six-second mark.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading posts (L) and a frame in the NBC Los Angeles clip (R):\n\nThe incident was also reported by local television channels CBS Los Angeles here and WPIX here in July 2013.", "lang": "en"}
