This claim is false.\n\nExample posts can be seen here and here .\n\nMisinformation about the Obamas having to surrender their law licenses has been shared on Facebook for several years. Posts allege that Barack Obama \u201csurrendered his license back in 2008 in order to escape charges he lied on his bar application\u201d while Michelle Obama \u201c\u2019voluntarily surrendered\u2019 her law license in 1993 after a Federal Judge gave her the choice between surrendering her license or standing trial for Insurance fraud.\u201d Both claims are false.\n\nThe \u201cLawyer Search\u201d function on the Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission (IARDC) website provides information on the current status of the Obamas\u2019 authority to practice law ( here ).\n\nA search for Barack Obama shows he was admitted to the Illinois State Bar Association on December 17, 1991, but that he is no longer authorized to practice law. His entry shows under \u201cIllinois Registration Status\u201d that the former president is \u201cRetired - not authorized to practice law or provide pro bono services\u201d and that his last registered year was 2008, the year he was elected president. Under \u201cPublic Record of Discipline and Pending Proceedings\u201d it says \u201cNone.\u201d\n\nThe entry for Michelle Obama provides her maiden name, Michelle Lavaughn Robinson, and the date she was admitted to the bar, May 12, 1989. Her Illinois registration status is \u201cVoluntarily inactive and not authorized to practice law\u201d and she was last registered in 1993.As is the case with her husband, under Michelle\u2019s Public Record of Discipline and Pending Proceedings it says \u201cNone.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Illinois ARDC told Reuters via email: \u201cNeither Barack nor Michelle Obama has ever been the subject of attorney disciplinary proceedings in Illinois. The \u2018Lawyer Search\u2019 portion of the ARDC\u2019s website ( www.iardc.org ) correctly notes that the Obamas are not currently authorized to practice law in Illinois, but that is because Barack Obama elected to assume retired status and Michelle Obama elected to assume inactive status. Both could return to active status and practice law if they desired.\u201d\n\nFalse. The Obamas did not have to surrender their licenses to practice law, and neither has been the subject of attorney disciplinary proceedings in Illinois.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
