Although Africans living in China have reported discrimination linked to the coronavirus pandemic, AFP Fact Check found that various widely-shared clips were filmed years ago and have nothing to do with the virus.\n\n\u201cThis is an African being violated, tortured and humiliated in China. What should we do with the Chinese on our lands?\u201d reads a tweet shared more than 3,000 times since it was posted on April 19, 2020.\n\nThe accompanying footage shows a black man pushed to the ground, punched and kicked by a group of Asian men at a market.\n\nThe footage has also been circulating on Facebook (here and here) and YouTube (here and here) since mid-April.\n\nAs covered by AFP, Africans living in China have reported stigma and discrimination during the pandemic, including forced evictions, arbitrary quarantines and mass coronavirus testing, apparently linked to a cluster of cases in the Nigerian community in the southern city of Guangzhou.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s apologised after a sign telling black people they were banned from entering a branch in the city prompted outrage online.\n\nAFP Fact Check ran a reverse image search on the footage using the InVID WeVerify tool and found a longer version published in 2017. The victim can be heard speaking in the Nigerian language Igbo, identified by AFP Fact Check's Lagos-based journalist Mayowa Tijani.\n\nTwo minutes into the clip, the man shouts to bystanders: \u201cHow can you let these people do this to me?\u201d\n\nA Google search for the phrase \u201cNigerian man beaten by Chinese\u201d revealed an article from Nigerian news site Vanguard featuring a video which is now unavailable.\n\n\u201cA Nigerian man is being beaten by some Chinesemen because \u2026 Ikechukwu Obih posted the video on Facebook in June 2015 (sic),\u201d the article's only line of text reads.\n\nAFP Fact Check found Ikechukwu Obih\u2019s Facebook profile as well as the video in a post from June 12, 2015, captioned \u201cChinese beating Nigerian in China\u201d. AFP contacted Obih but has not yet received a reply.\n\nAFP Fact Check\u2019s Hong Kong-based journalist Rachel Yan identified Chinese spoken in the footage, audible from 2\u201918\u201d onwards.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no good calling the police, they won\u2019t do anything. Take a rope and tie him,\u201d one man says in Mandarin.\n\n\u201cHe owes people money, for several years\u2026 owes more than 100,\u201d another says in Cantonese.\n\nUsing Chinese mapping service Baidu Maps, AFP Fact Check traced the scene in the video to a shopping arcade in the city of Foshan in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong.\n\nAnother video circulating online shows a black man repeatedly struck with batons by a group of men speaking an Asian language. A text overlay on the footage reads \u201cChina against black\u2019s (sic)\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are now SLAVES OF CHINESE,\u201d reads the caption on a Facebook post shared more than 800 times since it was published on April 16, 2020.\n\nThe video has also been circulating on Instagram (here and here) since mid-April.\n\nAFP Fact Check ran a reverse image on the video and found an article on US site MTO News from September 2018 featuring the graphic clip.\n\nThe report claims that a young Zambian man studying in China was beaten to death by thugs \u201cfor dating a Chinese woman\u201d.\n\nAFP Fact Check ran a Google search for the phrase \u201cZambian beaten China 2018\u201d and found an article debunking the claim from September 2018 by Indonesian fact-checking site TurnBackHoax.\n\nTurnBackHoax\u2019s fact check claims the video shows a suspected thief being attacked in Malaysia, not a man beaten in China for dating a Chinese woman. It links to a 2016 article (warning: contains graphic images) on Malay news site World Of Buzz, which features screenshots of an extended version of the footage.\n\n\u201cThief With Parang Beaten into a Bloody Mess After a Failed Robbery in Sarawak,\u201d the headline reads. A parang is a type of knife and Sarawak is a Malaysian state on Borneo island.\n\n\u201cA recent post on Facebook by mandarin news page JBReport has gone viral after videos of a robber beaten to a bloody pulp surfaced on the internet (sic),\u201d the article reads.\n\nThe Facebook post from August 1, 2016 features three different videos of the attack taken from different angles. It says the man attacked had stolen from a shop in Kuching, the capital of Malaysia\u2019s Sarawak state.\n\n\u201cTaking justice into their own hands, the angry shop owners struck the robber with metal pipes,\u201d World Of Buzz\u2019s article claims.\n\nAccording to AFP Fact Check\u2019s journalist Ching Yee Choo, who covers Malaysia and Singapore, the group attacking the man are speaking Malay and a southeast Asian dialect, Hokkien. She picked out the words \u201crobbery\u201d and \u201ccheat\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou good at thieving, eh?\u201d one of the men asks.\n\nLocal newspaper The Borneo Post reported (in Malay) on the attack in an article from August 2, 2016, which gives a different version of events.\n\nAccording to the report which quotes local police, the 44-year-old man was in a games arcade with a friend when five men ran in, took him outside and attacked him. The men stole his mobile phone and cash and vandalised his car, the article says.\n\n\u201cThe five suspects accused the men of stealing,\u201d the Sarawak police chief is quoted as saying.\n\nOn a Facebook page called \u201cSarawak Viral\u201d, AFP found a post from August 2, 2016 describing the attack. The post features a photo of a car with smashed windows parked against a wall with the same yellow and black pattern as the footage showing the man being assaulted.\n\nAFP Fact Check has previously debunked a video purporting to show Kenyan and Chinese people fighting in Wuhan, the Chinese metropolis at the epicentre of the outbreak.", "lang": "en"}
