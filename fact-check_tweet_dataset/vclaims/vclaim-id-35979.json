Despite the lower share, they remain a high risk population.\n\u2022 None Experts say the much higher, incorrect figure could only be reached by effectively double counting. \n\n\n\n\n\nNearly half of new HIV infections in Kenya are among adolescents, a major drugmaker claimed during an international conference focused on the wellbeing of girls and young women.\n\n\u201cIn Kenya, 49% of new #HIV infections occur among adolescents,\u201d\n\nIs this claim accurate? We checked.\n\nThe claims were direct quotes from\n\nThey were said by Dr Violet Oramisi of Kenya\u2019s health ministry, Araujo said.\n\nOramisi is with the\n\n(Nascop), a state agency tasked with the country\u2019s response to HIV and Aids.\n\nOramisi told Africa Check that these were \u201cour estimates and they are publicly available for your reference\u201d. She added that the data was also in \u201crecently released HIV estimates\u201d from 2018.\n\nNew infections in adolescents much lower\n\nwas prepared by the National Aids Control Council (NACC), another state agency\n\nthe national response to HIV and Aids.\n\nIt shows that in 2017 there were\n\nnationally among adolescents, who it classified as being aged between 10 and 19. New infections could have been as low as 2,400 or as high as 15,900.\n\nThese adolescent infections accounted for 15.48% of the country\u2019s total new HIV infections, which were\n\n52,800. These could have been as low as 33,400 or as high as 77,500.\n\nHow are new infections counted?\n\nThe 2018 estimates report said it used modelling tools developed by\n\n\u201cModelled estimates are required because it is impossible to count the exact number of people living with HIV, people who are newly infected with HIV or people who have died from Aids-related illnesses in any country,\u201d the UN agency\n\n\u201cDoing so would require regularly testing every person for HIV and investigating all deaths, which is logistically impossible and ethically problematic.\u201d\n\n, UNAids also gave 53,000 as the total new HIV infections in Kenya in 2017. This data was collected by NACC, Dr Vernon Mochache told Africa Check. He is an HIV/Aids researcher with the\n\n, a University of Maryland programme which works in Kenya and former head of research at NACC.\n\nWhere does 49% statistic come from?\n\nDr Joshua Kimani is a senior researcher at the\n\n, which is mainly located at the N\n\nelson R. Mandela School of Medicine in South Africa\u2019s University of KwaZulu-Natal.\n\ntold Africa Check that the 49% figure could refer to a combination of both adolescents and young adults, known as young people. This was also echoed by the University of Maryland\u2019s Mochache.\n\nthe term \u201cyoung people\u201d is accepted by UN agencies to mean \u201cpersons between ages 10 and 24\u201d.\n\nUsing this approach, we looked at the statistics from the estimates report.\n\nWhat do the numbers show?\n\nCombining the new infections in adolescents (10-19) and young adults (15-24) resulted in a total of 25,900 - or 49% of the 52,800 new infections as Johnson & Johnson tweeted.\n\nHowever, this approach includes the 15 to 19 age band twice, as there is an overlap between adolescents (ages 10 to 19) and young adults (ages 15 to 24). We asked Nascop for clarification on how they had come up with their figure.\n\non how prepared health facilities in Kenya were to offer antiretroviral drugs to prevent HIV infection.\n\n\u201cthe country still experiences a large number of new infections estimated at 52,800 in 2017, 49% of which occurred among adolescents and young persons aged between 10 and 24 years.\u201d\n\nThe statistic was attributed to a \u201cKenya HIV estimates report 2018\u201d. The report of the same name was however only published seven months later, in October 2018.\n\nA statistician with the NACC, Kipkoech Mutai, told Africa Check that the agency only generates data for 10 to 19 years and 15 to 24 years and not the 10 to 24 years bracket as claimed.\n\nFranklyn Songok, who contributed to the Nascop report, told Africa Check that the 49% figure was indeed derived from totalling new infections for adolescents aged 10 to 19 and those of young adults aged 15 to 24. \u201cThat should not be the case. There is an overlap of [years] 15 to 19,\u201d Songok said.\n\nin New Hampshire, USA, who reviewed the figures, told Africa Check it was likely there had been double counting..\n\nAs far as I can tell, they have double counted. I cannot think of another way to get to the 49% figure,\n\nClaim incorrect, but youth still at risk\n\nIn the absence of any data showing adolescent new infections higher than 16% of all new infections, we rate this claim as incorrect.\n\nDespite this, adolescents are still at high risk. Kimani, from the Sub Saharan African Network for TB/HIV Research Excellence, said there are many reasons why adolescents and young women are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection.\n\n\u201cThey feel indestructible\u2026 They don't perceive themselves to be at risk and the problem is, in our setting in Kenya, there is intergenerational sex,\u201d he said.\n\nThis meant they were having more sexual experiences, including with older people for economic reasons, and using protection inconsistently.", "lang": "en"}
