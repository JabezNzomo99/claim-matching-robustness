The Philippines' Department of Science and Technology said it was not a photograph of the country\u2019s first satellite. The image has been widely used online for years in reports on China\u2019s Tiangong-1 space station.\n\nThe October 14 post contains a photo of the purported satellite, which has \u201cPHILIPPINES\u201d written on the panels that extend from its body.\n\nThe post, when translated to English, says: \u201cThis is the very first space satellite of the Philippines that has been sent to space. Only Digong our father was able to do this\u201d.\n\n\u201cDigong\u201d is one of the nicknames for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.\n\nThe Philippines has a satellite programme and it has sent at least two orbiters into space -- the first in 2016 and the second in October 2018.\n\nHowever, one of the program's scientists told AFP that the image in the Facebook post does not show the Philippines\u2019 first satellite.\n\n\u201cNo, it's not,\u201d said Gay Jane Perez, head of the programme's remote sensing and product development component.\n\nShe said the Philippines\u2019 first satellite was Diwata-1, which was launched into space in April 2016.\n\nDuterte became president in June 2016, after winning a landslide victory the prior month.\n\nThis picture from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency shows Diwata-1:\n\nA reverse image search revealed the photo in the Facebook post has been used repeatedly in reports dating back to early 2016 about China\u2019s Tiangong-1 space lab.\n\n\n\nThe image, which is credited to China\u2019s space agency CMSE, was used in mainstream reports like this one in the Guardian and this one on ABC Australia.\n\nThe misleading post was published by a Facebook page that supports Imee Marcos, the daughter of former Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos. The Marcos family is Duterte\u2019s ally.\n\nThe post has been shared more than 700 times.", "lang": "en"}
