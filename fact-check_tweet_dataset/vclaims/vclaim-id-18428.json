He has described Islam as a \u2018fascistic ideology\u2019.\u201d\n\nLabor's federal Home Affairs spokesperson Kristina Keneally wants the federal government to review and cancel the visa of British writer and activist Raheem Kassam, who is due to address an August 9-11 conference in Sydney. [1] [2]\n\nMr Kassam is scheduled to speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Sydney. The CPAC website states the conference is for people who \u201cdespaired at the prospect of a Shorten government controlled by militant unions and influenced by the Greens\u201d. It urged delegates to attend CPAC to \u201cjoin the brave, protect the future\u201d. Mr Kassam was listed to speak along with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott and NSW One Nation senator Mark Latham. The cost of attending the three-day CPAC conference ranged from $149-$599. [2] [3]\n\nSenator Keneally has urged for Mr Kassam\u2019s visa to be cancelled because he \u201chas an extensive history of vilifying people on the grounds of their race, religion, sexuality and gender\u201d. AAP FactCheck examined Senator Keneally's claim Mr Kassam had described the scripture of Islam, the Koran, as \u201cfundamentally evil\u201d and Islam, the Muslim religion, as a \u201cfascistic ideology\u201d. [1] [4]\n\nSenator Keneally said that in March 2019 the Morrison government banned British political commentator and writer Milo Yiannopoulos, who described Islam as \u201can alien and barbaric religion\u201d, and said it should apply the same measure to Mr Kassam. [1]\n\nSenator Keneally told the Senate on July 30, 2019: \u201cMr Kassam has an extensive history of vilifying people on the grounds of their race, religion, sexuality and gender. He has described the (Koran), the holy book of the Muslim faith, as \u201cfundamentally evil\u201d. Mr Kassam has campaigned for \u201climited migration\u201d against what he describes as \u201clarge-scale Muslim immigration\u201d. He has regularly attacked the LGBTI community with homophobic and transphobic comments on social media. We should not allow career bigots - a person who spreads hate speech about Muslims, about women and about gay and lesbian people - to enter our country with the express intent of undermining equity and equality.\u201d [5]\n\nAAP FactCheck checked Ms Keneally\u2019s published Senate statement against a parliamentary recording and the wording was correct.\n\nIn a July 31, 2019 tweet, Mr Kassam accused Ms Keneally of telling \u201clies\u201d about him and challenged her to repeat her \u201cdefamation\u201d outside of the Senate where she is not protected by parliamentary privilege. [6]\n\nSenator Keneally repeated the crux of her claims outside parliament on ABC\u2019s Radio National Drive on July 31, 2019, stating it was \u201cironic\u201d for Mr Kassam to threaten to sue her, given his support of free speech. [1]\n\nMr Kassam has since labelled Senator Keneally a \u201cbub\u201d, \u201ca fraud\u201d and \u201ca fascist\u201d on Twitter. [7]\n\nDonald Trump Jr, the son of US President Donald Trump, weighed into the debate with a July 31, 2109 tweet from his verified account accusing the Australian Labor Party of \u201ctrying to silence\u201d Mr Kassam because of \u201chis conservative views\u201d. \u201cThe insanity needs to stop,\u201d Mr Trump Jr tweeted. [8]\n\nThe CPAC website described Mr Kassam as \u201ca British political activist, former editor-in-chief of Breitbart News London, and former chief advisor to former UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader Nigel Farage. He is currently the global editor-in-chief of Human Events, a conservative American digital-only publication.\u201d [9]\n\nMr Kassam was born in Britain to Indian-Tanzanian immigrant parents and described himself as an \u201cAmericaphile\u201d and former Muslim. In 2016 he unsuccessfully ran to replace his former boss Nigel Farage as UKIP leader. In 2019 he purchased and relaunched the legacy conservative news outlet Human Events online. [10] [11] [12]\n\nAAP FactCheck traced the first part of Ms Keneally\u2019s claim - that Mr Kassam called the Koran \u201cfundamentally evil\u201d - to a March 24, 2018, Instagram post by Mr Kassam, whose handle is @raheemkassam. [13]\n\nMr Kassam states this Instagram post was in response to a supposed threat by Scottish police \u201cto find anonymous Twitter users who say mean things about the left or Islam online. I have a message for them\u2026\u201d The Instagram post includes an image of Mr Kassam with the following text: \u201cI am not anonymous. I am a conservative. I believe in traditional marriage, I believe in limited migration, I believe the Quran (sic) is fundamentally evil, I believe in free speech. Come arrest me fascists.\u201d The post had more than 650 likes. [13]\n\nMr Kassam\u2019s Instagram page is not verified by the platform, but he shared his Instagram handle on his verified Twitter page, confirming the account was his. [14]\n\nOn July 31, 2019, Mr Kassam told The Sydney Morning Herald he stood by the claim that the Koran was \"fundamentally evil\" but said \u201chis claim was misunderstood, saying it was evil \u2018if you only interpret it fundamentally - and I think that can be said of a lot of religions\u2019.\" [15]\n\nAAP FactCheck traced the second part of Ms Keneally\u2019s claim - that Mr Kassam described Islam as a \u201cfascistic ideology\u201d - to a BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today interview on August 2, 2018. [16]\n\nIn the BBC interview, Mr Kassam defended far-right figure Tommy Robinson (Stephen Christopher Yaxley-Lennon), a former English Defence League (EDL) leader released on bail pending an appeal against a contempt of court conviction.\n\nThe EDL website states it stands for \u201cdemocracy and the rule of law\u201d and educating the \u201cBritish public about Islam\u201d who\u2019ve \u201crisen from the English working class to act, lead and inspire in the struggle against global Islamification\u201d. [17]\n\nWhile the audio from the BBC interview is unavailable, Mr Kassam\u2019s comments were reported by two other media platforms. [16]\n\nOn August 2, 2018, inews.co.uk published a story headlined \u201cRaheem Kassam calls Islam a \u2018fascistic ideology\u2019 on BBC as he defends Tommy Robinson\u2019s EDL threat\u201d. The story stated \u201cRaheem Kassam has described Islam as a \u201cfascistic and totalitarian ideology\u201d in a BBC interview\u201d. [18]\n\nOn August 2, 2018, The Sun also published a story headlined \u201cRIGHT OR WRONG Who is Raheem Kassam? Former Ukip advisor, ex-Breitbart editor and Tommy Robinson supporter\u201d. The story stated: \u201cIn an interview on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today program on August 2, he (Mr Kassam) defended Robinson after he had been released from prison. He described Islam as a \u2018fascistic and totalitarian ideology\u2019.\u201d [19]\n\nIn a July 5, 2018 tweet Mr Kassam linked Islam to fascism when commenting on a news story about a Muslim mayor in Sheffield banning US President Donald Trump from visiting the city during his UK trip. \u201cWhat is it with these Muslim mayors that as soon as they get power they start acting like fascists? Oh right yeah sorry that\u2019s Islam\u2026,\u201d Mr Kassam tweeted. [20]\n\nBased on this evidence AAP FactCheck found Ms Keneally\u2019s claim that Mr Kassam called the Koran \u201cfundamentally evil\u201d and Islam a \u201cfascist ideology\u201d to be true.", "lang": "en"}
