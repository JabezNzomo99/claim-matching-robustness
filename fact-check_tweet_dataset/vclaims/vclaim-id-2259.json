They haven\u2019t.\n\nPacquiao, a Filipino boxer and politician, was said to have spent $50 million to rebuild Houston. Princes Harry and William were said to have given $100 million to assist and house victims of the flood. And Bolt, an Olympic sprinter, was said to have spent a whopping $150 million on hurricane relief.\n\nWhile other celebrities are indeed pledging thousands to the cause, these magnanimous donations haven\u2019t been reported on any credible news sites, and the celebrities have not made any such announcements on social media.\n\nThe stories about Bolt and Pacquiao used almost the exact same wording as a story we\u2019ve already debunked claiming boxer Floyd Mayweather donated $200 million for hurricane relief.\n\nThey each started with the quip \"To whom much is given, much is expected.\" They also falsely claimed the athletes had traveled to Houston and attributed the same quotes to each.\n\n\"It is a humanitarian gesture, an act of solidarity and support for a brotherly affected people,\" the stories attributed to Bolt, Pacquiao and Mayweather all say.\n\nUnlike some other fake news sites, this one doesn\u2019t have a disclaimer about the veracity of quotes or news reports, but it has all the tell-tale signs of a fake news peddler, like unattributed facts, no publication date and click-bait ads.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
