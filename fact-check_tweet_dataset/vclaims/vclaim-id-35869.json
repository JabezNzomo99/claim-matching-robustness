We received several queries asking if the reports were true. While we recommend reading the articles published by The Intercept, CBS News, and The BBC, we\u2019ll respond to readers\u2019 most pressing questions below.\n\nIs There a Native American Burial Site on Monument Hill?\n\nIn early February 2020, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) started construction on a segment of border wall inside Arizona\u2019s Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. CBP officials confirmed that \u201ccontrolled blasting\u201d had started in an area within the Roosevelt Reservation at Monument Mountain, which is also known as Monument Hill.\n\nOrgan Pipe Cactus National Monument is located in southern Arizona and sits just above the border of the United States and Mexico. To the east of this national park is the Tohono O\u2019odham Indian Reservation. According to tribe leaders, as well as archaeologists, Monument Hill is home to a Native American burial site.\n\nIn January 2020, Arizona Rep. Raul Grijalva surveyed the area with Ned Norris Jr., the chairman of the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation, Peter Steer, the tribe\u2019s historic preservation officer, and a group of archaeologists. Here\u2019s how Monument Hill was described in a set of briefing notes compiled by Grijalva\u2019s staff after the visit:\n\nArchaeologists noted that Tribal elders were interviewed and identified this hill as sacred to the O\u2019odham. This hill is first documented and mentioned in Father Kino\u2019s letters when there was no Sonoita. During Apache raids, if a body was found after battle the tribe would place the bodies on this hill. Meaning there are bodies of other tribes in Arizona among this Hill with bone fragments. DHS mentioned that they would back off on developing the Hill, but the work is still being done (as you can see the road is widened in the photos/video) even after the tribe mentioned the cultural and historic significance of this area in a letter. Archeologist Edward Abbey also mentioned Monument Hill and its significance to the tribe in his archeology papers published in 1960s.\n\nSteer provided similar information to AZ Central. According to Steer, Monument Hill was once used for religious ceremonies and was also the resting place of fallen soldiers. Steer said that bone fragments had also been found on the hill and that the tribe has been able to date back mentions of the hill to the 1600s.\n\n\u201cThis hill, from the information we\u2019ve been able to gather, was used by Hia-C\u2019ed O\u2019odham for religious ceremonies,\u201d Peter Steere said. \u201cThis is also a place, when the Apache were raiding out here, if the Apache warrior was killed, his body was placed on this hill.\u201d He added that the tribe is able to track mentions of the hill dating back hundreds of years. They have found possible references in letters written by Father Eusebio Kino, the famed Jesuit missionary that proselytized the area in the late 1600s. The tribe has documented information about the hill from O\u2019odham elders, as well as archaeologists who have worked in the area. \u201cWe have found a couple of places with bone fragments up here,\u201d Steere said.\n\nWhen Rep. Grijalva visited the area in January 2020, construction had not yet started. The Arizona congressman sent a letter to acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf expressing concern over the border wall\u2019s potential impact on the national monument and asked the government to address certain issues, such as the location and schedule for construction and the protection of groundwater resources. Grijalva said that he never received a response to his letter and in February 2020 construction crews began \u201ccontrolled blasting\u201d in the area.\n\nGrijalva told The Intercept: \u201cIt\u2019s been really frustrating. [\u2026] You would think that in a situation like this, that involves human remains, burial sites, bone fragments that are traced and dated a thousand years or more back, that there would be some sensitivity, for lack of a better word, on the part of DHS and the administration. There is none.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 9, 2020, Grijalva posted an update on social media stating that two of the four burial sites that he visited had already been disturbed by the construction of the border wall:\n\nThe U.S. does have laws such as the Environmental Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Native American Graves Protection Act. However, these laws can be circumvented if the government deems that they are at odd with national security.\n\nCBS News reports that the 2005 REAL ID Act gives the government \u201cbroad power to waive\u201d laws that stand in the way of national security:\n\nThe Trump administration has been able to legally construct the border wall over public land due in large part to a little known law passed in the wake of the 9/11. The REAL ID Act of 2005 gives the federal government broad power to waive other laws that stand in the way of national security. Under REAL ID, the Trump administration has waived dozens of laws \u2014 including the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Environmental Protection Act \u2014 in its bid to construct the border wall. \u201cOf the 21 times the (REAL ID) waiver has been enacted since 2005, 16 of those instances have occurred in the last two and a half years,\u201d reads the letter Grijalva sent to Homeland Security.\n\nWhat Has CBP Done to Minimize the Impact of the Border Wall in the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument?\n\nCBP does have an \u201cenvironmental monitor\u201d present during construction; an agency official also said that crews identify the \u201cbest construction management practices to minimize impacts on the environment to the greatest extent possible.\u201d\n\nWe reached out to CBP for more information about their efforts to minimize the environmental impact of the border wall and will update this article when more information becomes available.\n\nGrijalva was skeptical that these environmental monitors would do anything to prevent further damage to these sacred sites.\n\nGrijalva told The Intercept that he had zero faith that the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s \u201cenvironmental monitor will do anything to avoid, mitigate, or even point out some of the sacrilegious things that are occurring and will continue to occur, given the way they\u2019re proceeding.\u201d\n\nAre Other Native American Burial or Archaeological Sites at Risk?\n\nGrijalva was not the first to raise concerns about the border wall\u2019s impact on the area. A 123-page internal report from the park service obtained by The Washington Post via a Freedom of Information Act request warned that the border wall\u2019s construction could damage 22 archaeological sites at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument:", "lang": "en"}
