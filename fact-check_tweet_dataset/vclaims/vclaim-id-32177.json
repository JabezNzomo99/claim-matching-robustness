No, that's not true: There is no evidence that Silvano Echavarria, a 23-year-old Texas resident, was not either a U.S. citizen or a legal immigrant when he was arrested for the murder of Pedro Munive, an elderly grandfather whose lifeless body was found in the parking lot of a Pasadena, Texas apartment complex in August 2019. The U.S. Marshal's news release about Echavarria's capture and the local reporting do not mention the suspect's citizenship status, but details of his previous criminal history would disqualify him from protection from deportation under DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n\nThe false claim originated from an article (archived here) published by illegalaliencrimereport.com on September 3, 2018 under the title \"'DREAMER' STOMPED 83-YEAR-OLD MAN TO DEATH IN TEXAS.

In fact, he was charged with stabbing someone in 2012 and then records show he violated his probation.\n\nThe Houston Chronicle's website offered more details about his criminal record:\n\nEchavarria's criminal record would have prevented his gaining \"Dreamer\" status.
