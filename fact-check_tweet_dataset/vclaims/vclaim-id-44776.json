Also, in a small number of states, certain education and Medicaid benefits are already available to immigrants living in the country illegally who meet specified criteria.\n\nIn January 2020, Snopes readers inquired about a meme that had been circulating on Facebook since July 2019:\n\nThe meme presented three claims, which we unpack below:\n\nThe above-displayed meme did not specify a specific state or branch of government, implying all Democrats were responsible for the actions in question; however, the first claim in the meme (\u201cDemocrats killed a bill for tuition assistance for children of veterans killed in battle\u201d) was similar to one we rated \u201cTrue\u201d in April 2019 as it pertained to New York state.\n\nAnd regarding that bill, \u201ckilled,\u201d as the meme stated, is a strong word in this context, given that similar legislation was still listed as in committee and potentially set to take effect April 1, 2020, at the time of this writing. However, it\u2019s true that in 2019 Democrats in a committee of the state New York Assembly voted to block a bill expanding the state\u2019s tuition aid program covering so-called \u201cGold Star\u201d families, defined as immediate relatives of service members who \u201clost their lives while engaged in hostilities, as a result of an international terrorist attack, or under certain other circumstances.\u201d The bill proposed offering \u201cfree tuition\u201d not just to Gold Star families but also to dependent family of service members who died while performing official military duties.\n\nTo be clear: The blocked bill proposed expanding the state\u2019s Military Enhanced Recognition Incentive and Tribute (MERIT) scholarship program to include family members of those killed or disabled in non-combat situations. The MERIT program already provides tuition and other assistance to family members of military personnel killed or disabled while engaged in (or training for) hostilities.\n\nIn other words, the children of someone \u201ckilled in battle,\u201d as the meme put it, would seem to qualify for the existing tuition-assistance program. The proposed extension of funding would have also covered family members who were killed or disabled while not in combat.\n\nIt should be noted for what reason the Democrats stopped the bill. According to Newsday:\n\nDemocrats said they did not support the Republican proposal because it was released after legislators passed the state\u2019s $175 billion budget April 1, [2019], meaning it would have no source of funding even if it were signed into law. Democratic legislators said their college aid proposal would go into effect April 1, 2020, presumably giving lawmakers time to include additional spending for military family scholarships in next year\u2019s budget.\n\nNot wanting to wait, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, announced a plan on April 17, 2019, to immediately grant tuition assistance to family members of all New York service members who were killed while performing any official duties, effectively providing a stop-gap until the new legislation took effect in 2020.\n\nSo while Democrats did indeed block a tuition-assistance bill for families of service members who were killed or disabled outside of combat, this applied only in New York state and tuition assistance remained available to families of service members who were killed or disabled while in service.\n\nThe second claim (\u201c\u2026 THEN APPROVE subsidizing the education and healthcare of Illegal Immigrants\u201d) was similar, in part, to one we rated as \u201cMixture\u201d in February 2019.\n\nAs we previously reported, New York\u2019s DREAM Act (not to be confused with proposed federal legislation of the same name) allows undocumented high school students to qualify for in-state, college-tuition assistance to public universities and community colleges.\n\nAgain, this legislation applied only to New York state.\n\nIt is true that some Medicaid and Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) benefits have been extended, with various conditions and exceptions, to immigrants of varying status in a few states, including New York.\n\nWhile the idea of promising health care to \u201cundocumented\u201d immigrants has certainly received support among Democratic presidential candidates leading up to the 2020 election, it is not a nationwide benefit, as the meme may suggest.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s worth noting that the order of events presented in the meme is misleading, as the New York state DREAM Act was passed before the tuition-assistance bill.\n\nGiven the kernels of truth presented in this overall oversimplified and misleading presentation, we rate this claim as \u201cMixture.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
