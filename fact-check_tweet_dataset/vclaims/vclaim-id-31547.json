The agreement included an all-sides ceasefire, with Moscow ensuring that Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s forces would stop advancing while Turkey secured the area from the remaining Islamic State fighters and reopened two strategic highways.\n\nBut tensions erupted after the Syrian government launched an offensive last April, disrupting the ceasefire and violating the treaty with Turkey.\n\nAfter Syrian government forces killed 13 Turkish troops earlier this month, Turkey said it warned Russia of possible military action unless Assad\u2019s forces withdrew from the strategic town of Idlib by the end of February.\n\nThe two sides held negotiations in Moscow on Feb. 17-18 but \u201ccould not reach a breakthrough,\u201d according to Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin. Turkey rejected Russia\u2019s proposals, and the only agreement reached was to continue talking, Kalin said.\n\nOn Feb. 19, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said Ankara was \u201cmaking final warnings\u201d to the Assad government and its allies to withdraw from Idlib, and that an offensive against Syrian government troops was now \u201ca matter of time.\u201d The Kremlin said a direct military confrontation between Turkey and Assad would be a \u201cworst-case scenario.\u201d\n\nErkhov blamed Turkey, saying Russia and the Syrian regime were only acting in response to Ankara\u2019s ceasefire violations. He implied that accusations that Russian and Assad had targeted civilians, bombing and shelling residential areas, were baseless.\n\nMark Lowcock, the U.N. under-secretary for humanitarian affairs, said in a Feb. 17 statement that \u201cthe crisis in north-west Syria has reached a horrifying new level.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe violence in northwest Syria is indiscriminate,\u201d the statement read. \u201cHealth facilities, schools, residential areas, mosques and markets have been hit. Schools are suspended, many health facilities have closed. There is a serious risk of disease outbreaks. Basic infrastructure is falling apart. We are now receiving reports that settlements for displaced people are being hit, resulting in deaths, injuries and further displacement.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 15, Mark Cutts, the U.N. deputy regional humanitarian coordinator for the Syria crisis, tweeted a video showing the aftermath of the bombing.\n\n\u201cRecent video from Ariha showing the devastation caused by airstrikes/shelling by Syrian Government forces & their allies. At least 1,700 civilians - mostly women & children - killed in NW Syria in the last 9 months. Stop the carnage!\u201d Cutts said.\n\nRussia has maintained military bases in Syria for decades, and launched the first in a series of airstrikes targeting the Syrian opposition in September 2015.\n\nDespite this, the Kremlin\u2019s official position was that no Russian troops were on the ground in Syria.Yet, in December 2017, President Vladimir Putin ordered the withdrawal of Russian troops from Syria.\n\nMoscow has consistently denied casualties among its military personnel in Syria. Still, media have reported the deaths of hundreds of Russian troops in fighting there, as well as casualties among private military contractors. Moscow has denied the involvement of private Russian military contractors in the Syrian conflict.\n\nLast October, Russia\u2019s defense ministry said it sent an additional 300 military policemen to Syria to patrol its borders.\n\nThis month, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said Russian military specialists died in Syria. Some media reported this as a \u201crare admission of casualties.\u201d\n\nAmbassador Erkhov blamed the deaths of Russian officers on Turkey, for failing to secure the area from Islamic State forces.\n\nA group of Russian investigative journalists called the Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT) reported that it had identified the four dead Russian military specialists as officers of the Federal Security Service (FSB).", "lang": "en"}
