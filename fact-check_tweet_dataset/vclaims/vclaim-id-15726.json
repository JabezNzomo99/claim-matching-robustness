So is the Conservatives\u2019 claim any more useful?\n\nEssentially, no. The Conservatives\u2019 calculations are flawed in three ways. Like the Labour claim, a fundamental problem is that in many councils it\u2019s not possible to say that one party sets your council tax. Additionally, the \u201cband D\u201d rate used for calculating average bills is not a good method of comparison. And even with that, the averages are worked out incorrectly.\n\nThis makes their figure pretty much meaningless.\n\nHow the Conservative party calculated their figures\n\nThe Conservative party told us they calculated the average band D council tax in 2019/20 for each party, in each of the four main types of council structure (London borough, metropolitan borough, unitary authority and two-tier districts). So to work out the total average council tax bill for a party, they added up that party\u2019s average bill in each of the four council structures, and divided it by four. If that sounds confusing, the table below illustrates what they did.\n\nThere are many reasons why this is bad.\n\nFirstly, the average is worked out incorrectly, because it gives equal weight to each council structure.\n\nWhat does that mean in practice?\n\nTo take an example, the Conservatives control six London boroughs, which make up 4% of the roughly 160 councils they control (excluding counties). Yet in their calculation, London Boroughs contribute 25% of average, meaning they are massively overrepresented. These six councils also have significantly lower bills than the average across other Conservative councils.\n\nBut the problems aren\u2019t limited to flawed calculations.\n\nYou can\u2019t always say which party sets council tax\n\nEven if the Conservatives had done their averages correctly their numbers don\u2019t tell us very much because of how they calculated the averages in county and district councils (the Labour party had a similar issue with their calculations). Explaining this requires a bit of background context.\n\nIn England there are, broadly, two main local government structures\u2014single-tier and two-tier. In single-tier structures, one council is responsible for providing the majority of local government services, and collecting council tax. Single tier councils include London boroughs, metropolitan boroughs or unitary authorities.\n\nIn a two-tier system, you\u2019ll have two main councils. The county council sets most of the tax and provides major services (like education, transport and social care.) Within a county area, separate district councils provide other services, like bin collections and housing, and collect council tax\u2014both the relatively small amount for their own services, and the larger amount on behalf of their county council.\n\nSo in two-tier systems, the district council which collects your council tax isn\u2019t setting most of that bill. Yet the Conservatives\u2019 calculation assumes that in two-tier councils, all of your bill is set by the party controlling the district council.\n\nBecause almost all county councils are Conservative-run (and none are Labour- or Lib Dem-run), the Lib Dem and Labour averages for two-tier councils are actually overwhelmingly the result of Conservative county councils.\n\nThis is not to say that there is a perfect way to calculate average bills for each of the different parties. The issues with two-tier authorities make it very hard to make a meaningful comparison. But the Conservative\u2019s method is a flawed approach.\n\nComparing Band D tax rates can also be misleading\n\nPutting aside the problems with how the Conservatives calculated their figures, there\u2019s a broader problem with them using \u201cband D\u201d tax bills to calculate their averages.\n\nWithin each English council area, council tax will vary depending on the value of your home. Homes are valued on a national scale from band A (the cheapest homes) to Band H (the most expensive).\n\nHistorically, the standard way to compare council tax costs across different councils has been to look at the average bill for a two-person household in a band D home. This is because it compares a similar type of home in any given council.\n\nBut this approach often doesn\u2019t accurately tell us about bills for most residents, because two-thirds of homes in England are in bands A-C. So a band D bill is above-average.\n\nAnd councils with similar average council tax bills for all eligible residents can have very different \u201cband D\u201d rates.\n\nConsider the councils of Darlington and Southend-on-Sea, which charge very similar council tax (averaging \u00a31,200 and \u00a31,204 respectively per dwelling ).\n\nBut Darlington\u2019s band D charge (excluding precepts set by other authorities) is \u00a31,506 while Southend\u2019s is \u00a31,382. So while Darlington actually charges an average of \u00a34 less per dwelling than Southend, its Band D rate is \u00a3124 more.\n\nThat\u2019s partly because, in Darlington 80% of homes are below Band D while in Southend it\u2019s 69%, and the formula for setting council tax bills is based on the number of Band D homes in an area. It\u2019s quite complicated, but in short: while both councils need to collect roughly the same amount of money per household, the band D rate is higher in Darlington because these homes are essentially counterbalancing the lower tax on cheaper homes to a greater extent than in Southend.", "lang": "en"}
