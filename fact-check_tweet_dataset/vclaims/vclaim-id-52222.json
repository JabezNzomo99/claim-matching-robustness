U.S. trade with Mexico and Canada was already growing prior to NAFTA and it likely would have continued to do so without an agreement,\u201d according to a May 2017 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.\n\nAccording to the independent Center for Automotive Research, rejiggering NAFTA comes with risks for the auto industry. Every auto-producing region in the world relies on low-cost labor to be competitive, the group found in an April report, and it\u2019s not clear the United States could bring back some of the production functions that have been outsourced to Mexico since 1994. \u201cSetting a very stringent automobile ROO [domestic production requirement] with the goal of bringing manufacturing back to the United States and the NAFTA region could have the opposite effect if the content targets are set too high, or the rules are too onerous,\u201d the CAR report said.\n\n\"In 2017, Ford Motor Company decided to cancel its planned move of Focus production to Mexico and to source the Focus from an existing plant in China instead. The direct consequence of that decision is that there are fewer U.S. jobs assembling the major components (engines, transmissions) and other parts for the Focus as those parts are primarily sourced in Asia for Chinese production. At the same time, the Michigan plant that currently produces the Focus will be retooled to build the Ford Ranger and later the Bronco. These vehicles will mainly use engines sourced from Ford Engine plants in Cleveland and Lima, Ohio, and transmissions will primarily come from the company\u2019s Livonia, Michigan transmission facility. \u201cDepending on other sourcing information not yet publicly available and the sales volumes for these vehicles, the Michigan plant will likely support more U.S., Canadian, and Mexican jobs than it did when producing the Focus and previous models in that Michigan plant. The product allocation is a net positive for the United States, but the economic impact could have been stronger still had Focus production moved to Mexico instead of China.\u201d\n\nThe strange tale about why Bill Clinton said NAFTA would create 1 million jobs\n\nTrump\u2019s false assertion that Canada claims to \u2018make\u2019 $100 billion in trade with the U.S.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s claim that the U.S. government \u2018certified\u2019 700,000 jobs lost by NAFTA\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s claim that \u2018we always lose\u2019 in U.S.-Canada trade disputes", "lang": "en"}
