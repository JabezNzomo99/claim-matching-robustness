The image actually depicts an action figure of the politician which has been sold online since at least 2017.\n\nThe posts were shared on Facebook days before Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, best known by his nickname Ahok, was released from prison on January 24 after serving 20 months in jail on blasphemy charges. Here is an AFP story on his release.\n\nOne of the posts featuring the image was this January 20 entry in a pro-Ahok Facebook group, which has more than 120,000 members.\n\nThe post\u2019s translated caption reads: \u201cAhok, the bearer of Indonesia\u2019s sacred national flag. This is an Ahok sculpture at the Madame Tussauds wax museum in Hong Kong, something that confirms his status as one of the best provincial governors in the world. He is the first governor to have a wax sculpture exhibited at the museum. The Indonesian nation is proud to have Ahok.\u201d\n\nIn the image in the misleading Facebook post, the figure of Ahok is pictured in green uniform and his arms are visibly jointed at the elbow and wrist. His full name is on a small nameplate at his feet.\n\nIn May 2017, Jakarta\u2019s then top politician -- a Christian of ethnic Chinese descent -- was jailed for blaspheming Islam in a comment he made on the campaign trail during his re-election bid, which he subsequently lost. Here is an AFP report on his jailing.\n\nMany comments in the post praised the purported wax sculpture, including this January 23 remark: \u201cGreat. Okay, this is cool.\u201d\n\nAccording to a reverse image search the image was taken from an advertisement for an action figure of the former politician which was posted to Instagram by the toy\u2019s maker, Simbiosix Studios, on August 17, 2017.\n\nIn the post, the creator said it \u201capologises for the late release of The Governor \u2159 scale collectible action figure.\u201d\n\nSimbiosix Studios also shared the image on the same day to its Facebook page.", "lang": "en"}
