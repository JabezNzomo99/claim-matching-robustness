The plan would require voters to show an approved form of photographic ID in order to vote in a UK parliamentary election in Great Britain and local elections in England. Photographic ID is already required to vote in Northern Ireland.\n\nThis led to responses highlighting how few people are accused or convicted of impersonating someone else at a polling station\u2014the offence which the voter ID scheme is meant to combat\u2014compared to how many people have been prevented from voting due to pilot voter ID schemes the government has run.\n\nThese figures are broadly accurate. More than four times as many people were prevented from voting in May 2019 due to the voter ID pilot scheme, than have been accused of impersonating someone else at a polling station since 2010.\n\nIt has also been noted that millions of people do not have a form of photographic ID which would be valid if voter ID schemes were rolled out nationally. This is accurate\u2014although under the government\u2019s latest plans a free \u201celectoral ID\u201d would be made available.\n\nHow many people were prevented from voting?\n\nThe most recent trial of the voter ID scheme took place during the May 2019 local elections, across ten pilot areas in England. In some areas people had to show \u201ca specified form of photo ID\u201d in order to vote, while in others they also had the option of showing \u201ctwo pieces of specified non-photo ID\u201d (including things like bank statements and utility bills) or a poll card.\n\nIn total, 1,968 people were turned away for not having the correct ID. Of those people, 740 did not return to vote\u201438% of those who were turned away. Across the trial areas, the number of people affected represented between 0.03% and 0.7% of the total votes cast.\n\nIn 2018 trials, 31-34% (between 326 and 350 people across five pilot areas) did not return to the polling booth after being initially turned away. This ranged from 0.06% to 0.4% of the total votes cast across the five areas.\n\nActor and writer David Schneider claimed that 819 people were stopped from voting across eight areas, which is based on outdated information. It was reported shortly after the 2019 pilot scheme in May that across eight of the ten areas \u201c819 people were turned away from polling stations and did not return\u201d, and was based on findings from the Local Government Chronicle.\n\nThe Local Government Chronicle was reporting on initial estimates, and we\u2019ve asked them why these found a higher number of people were unable to vote than is shown in the official data which was published later.\n\nMore people turned away in one day than accused of polling station fraud in a decade\n\nAs we\u2019ve written before, the government previously cited a rise in cases of \u201cpeople pretending to be other people to steal their votes\u201d as a key reason for the voter ID scheme.\n\nBut as we pointed out last time, that increase was only between two specific years (2014 and 2016), and more recent figures show a decline in the number of cases. The number of cases is also small.\n\nIn elections between 2010 and 2018, across the whole country, 181 people have been accused of impersonating someone else at a polling station. Most accusations resulted in no further action being taken.\n\nThat means that the number of people who didn\u2019t return to cast a vote after being turned away during the 2019 trial\u2014740 people\u2014is over four times the number that have been accused of impersonating someone else at a polling station since 2010.\n\nDavid Schneider is correct that only one person was convicted of voter personation at a polling station in 2017 (the year of the last general election). We\u2019ve only seen evidence of one other conviction since 2010.\n\nHow many people don\u2019t have ID?\n\nLabour MP Cat Smith claimed that \u201c3.5 million don\u2019t have access to any photo ID. If you restrict that to passport or driving licence it\u2019s 11 million.\u201d\n\nThis correctly quotes research which is from 2015 but the most recent available. The Electoral Commission found that 3.5 million people in Great Britain (7.5% of the electorate) didn\u2019t have a form of photo ID which would have been acceptable for a voter ID scheme. The same report found that 11 million people did not have a passport or driving license.\n\nThe report also recommended that a \u201cVoter Card\u201d should be made freely available in Great Britain, if the voter ID scheme was adopted.\n\nUnder the government\u2019s latest plans, voters without an approved form of ID will be able to apply for a free \u201celectoral ID\u201d would be introduced alongside any voter ID scheme, so it\u2019s likely that the number of voters unable to provide acceptable ID at a polling station would go down if a voter ID scheme were rolled out nationally.\n\nWe\u2019ve previously looked in more detail at the wider impact voter ID schemes have had on turnout in other countries.", "lang": "en"}
