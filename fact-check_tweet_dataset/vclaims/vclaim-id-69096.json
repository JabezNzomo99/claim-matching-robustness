That\u2019s a made-up story resurfacing on social media.\n\nAn obscure website called Phoenix Post published a story Aug. 14 headlined, \"VIDEO Kevin Bacon Saying \u2018We Are Blessed To Have Donald Trump As Our President\u2019.\"\n\nBut there\u2019s no video of Bacon saying that. This story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe false story has been around for months on other websites. Bacon in December 2017 tweeted a link to a Gossip Cop story debunking the narrative. \"Wow. Thanks for clearing this up,\" Bacon wrote in the tweet.\n\nBacon went further in a separate December tweet, saying there was nothing about Trump\u2019s policies \"that I agree with. And nothing about his character that I admire.\"\n\nPhoenix Post claimed Bacon\u2019s praise for Trump came during an interview on ABC\u2019s This Week. But the Gossip Cop story shared by Bacon noted that the actor hadn\u2019t been on the ABC show since 2007.\n\nThe Phoenix Post\u2019s headline explicitly says \"Kevin Bacon,\" but the text of the story replaced his last name with \"publisher 1st baron verulam,\" or \"1st Baron Verulam\" (apparently trying to reference a title given to the philosopher Francis Bacon).\n\nPunditFact has fact-checked multiple hoaxes about celebrities praising Trump, including these involving Denzel Washington, Emma Stone, and Jennifer Aniston.\n\nBacon did not say \"we are blessed to have Donald Trump as our president.\" We rate that fabricated story as Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
