Verlag appears to be made up.\n\nThe Facebook post links to an Alien News article reporting that Verlag discovered the two large structures on the sea floor in the Bermuda Triangle. (RELATED: Is Hurricane Irma The \u2018Most Powerful\u2019 Atlantic Storm On Record?)\n\n\u201cDr. Meyer Verlag discovered two giant pyramids three times the size of the pyramid of Cheops, in Egypt,\u201d claims the article. \u201cThose pyramids are made of an unidentifiable crystal-like material and are located at a depth of two thousand meters. According to Dr. Meyer, this discovery can be associated to the innumerable mysterious disappearances around the Bermuda Triangle.\u201d\n\nNo articles about pyramids being discovered in the Bermuda Triangle appear on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s website, however. An internet search for such a discovery only turned up credible news outlets debunking the claim in 2016.\n\nThe Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any record of Verlag existing beyond versions of the same story, further adding to the article\u2019s dubiousness. The oceanographer appears to be made up.\n\nStories about crystal pyramids in the Bermuda Triangle date back to at least the 60s, according to Snopes.", "lang": "en"}
