None of the contaminated beef was sold in Burger King restaurants.\n\nThe article, published on Worthytoshare.com, appears to reference a real beef contamination incident involving one of Burger King\u2019s suppliers in the U.K, though it inflates Burger King\u2019s involvement and its impact on the company. (RELATED: Video Claims A NYC Restaurant Got A License To Serve Human Meat)\n\nIn January 2013, Burger King announced that it had stopped purchasing beef from Silvercrest Foods as a \u201cvoluntary and precautionary measure\u201d after tests found horse DNA in some of the Irish meat supplier\u2019s products, reported CBS News. Silvercrest, which was owned by ABP Food Group at the time, had imported the contaminated beef from an unapproved supplier in Poland, according to a 2013 Burger King press release.\n\nThere is, however, no evidence that Burger King \u201ctried to sweep it under the rug,\u201d nor that the company admitted to selling burgers containing horse meat supplied by Silvercrest. In fact, Burger King issued a press release contradicting the article\u2019s claim Jan. 31, 2013.\n\n\u201cOur independent DNA test results on products taken from BURGER KING\u00ae restaurants were negative for any equine DNA,\u201d the company said in that press release. \u201cHowever, four samples recently taken from the Silvercrest plant have shown the presence of very small trace levels of equine DNA. This product was never sold to our restaurants.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time claims about Burger King serving contaminated sandwiches have circulated online. In 2017, fact-checking website PolitiFact debunked a similar article. Snopes debunked another the year before that.", "lang": "en"}
