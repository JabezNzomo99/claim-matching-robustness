Rick Santorum said he had \u201cno problem\u201d with former National Security Adviser John Bolton testifying after \u201cthis impeachment thing\u201d ends.\n\n\u201cMore Reputard logic, decide the case then let\u2019s hear from the witness??\u201d wrote one user who shared the article.\n\nSantorum was speaking about Bolton releasing his book, not about him testifying.\n\nCNN anchor Jake Tapper asked the former Pennsylvania senator during a Jan. 28 panel for his \u201ctake\u201d on the timing of Bolton submitting his forthcoming memoir for a White House pre-publication review and the subsequent leak of an unpublished draft to The New York Times. (RELATED: Did Kevin McCarthy Say Trump Killed Qasem Soleimani \u2018Because Adam Schiff \u201cSpent The Last Year On Impeachment\u201d\u2018?)\n\nIn the unpublished manuscript, Bolton alleges Trump told him in August that he wanted to continue withholding military aid from Ukraine until officials there helped with investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and other political opponents, reported The New York Times. Bolton\u2019s lawyer, Charles Cooper, issued a statement following that story saying the book manuscript had been given to the National Security Council for review on Dec. 30.\n\nPer the CNN transcript, here\u2019s what Santorum actually said about Bolton:\n\nThis is someone who deeply believes in his worldview and what is best for America, and I think he felt compelled to write something about the state of foreign policy in American and where our country\u2019s going. I have no problem with any of that, I have no problem with him criticizing the president. I have, actually, no problem with him recounting conversations with the president. I just really question the timing of doing this when you know that something like this could happen, and I think that was not judicious.\n\nThe same day as the panel Raw Story posted an article with the headline saying, \u201cRick Santorum: \u2018I have no problem\u2019 with John Bolton testifying after \u2018this impeachment thing\u2019 is over.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no record of Santorum expressing the sentiment attributed to him in the Raw Story headline during that CNN panel discussion. A review of the transcript and video didn\u2019t turn up a single instance of the former Pennsylvania senator using the words \u201ctestimony\u201d or \u201ctestify\u201d in reference to Bolton.\n\nSantorum stated later in the CNN panel that he thought Bolton should have waited \u201cuntil this impeachment thing passed\u201d to submit his book for pre-publication review.

Raw Story appears to have mischaracterized his remarks. We rate this headline false.", "lang": "en"}
