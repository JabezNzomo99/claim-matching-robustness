But climate scientists say it\u2019s \u201cextremely likely\u201d that human activity, including CO2 emissions, is the main cause of warming since the mid-20th century.\n\nScott Pruitt made his claim in an interview with CNBC\u2019s Joe Kernen.\n\nKernen, March 9: Do you believe that it\u2019s been proven that CO2 is the primary control knob for climate? Do you believe that? Pruitt: No I, no I think that, that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there\u2019s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact. So no, I would not agree that it\u2019s a primary contributor to the, to the global warming that we see. But we don\u2019t know that yet, as far as, we, we need, we need to continue the debate, continue the review and the analysis.\n\nAs we have written, Pruitt and others in President Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet have taken the position lately that the climate is changing and humans have contributed, but they have said that scientists can\u2019t measure or don\u2019t understand human impact precisely. As we\u2019ve said, scientists can measure that impact with varying levels of certainty and precision.\n\nThis time Pruitt went a little further when he disagreed that \u201chuman activity,\u201d or CO2 emissions, is a \u201cprimary contributor.\u201d We asked the EPA if Pruitt was referring to human activity generally or just CO2 emissions, but EPA spokeswoman Julia Valentine declined to answer our question. So we\u2019ll address both human activity\u2019s contribution as a whole and CO2 emissions in particular.\n\nAccording to the U.N.\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s fifth assessment report, it is \u201cextremely likely\u201d (at least 95 percent probable) that more than half of the observed temperature increase since the mid-2oth century is due to human, or anthropogenic, activities.\n\nIPCC, 2014: Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have increased since the pre-industrial era, driven largely by economic and population growth, and are now higher than ever. This has led to atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide that are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years. Their effects, together with those of other anthropogenic drivers, have been detected throughout the climate system and are extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.\n\nTo be clear, increased anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions aren\u2019t just caused by the burning of fossil fuels, and they don\u2019t just include CO2. Other greenhouse gases include methane and nitrous oxide, and other sources include deforestation, decomposition of wastes in landfills and agriculture. Still, the report adds, \u201cEmissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes contributed about 78% of the total GHG emissions increase from 1970 to 2010.\u201d\n\nWhat about natural contributors to global warming?\n\nNASA explains that \u201ccarbon dioxide is released through natural processes such as respiration and volcano eruptions,\u201d for example. The agency also says, \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to assume that changes in the sun\u2019s energy output would cause the climate to change, since the sun is the fundamental source of energy that drives our climate system,\u201d adding that \u201cstudies show that solar variability has played a role in past climate changes.\u201d\n\nBut when scientists who contributed to the IPCC report examined trends in global warming, they ruled out these natural factors as the primary cause. In fact, they are \u201cvirtually certain\u201d (at least 99 percent probable) that natural climatic variability \u201calone cannot account for the observed global warming since 1951.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: SciCheck is made possible by a grant from the Stanton Foundation.", "lang": "en"}
