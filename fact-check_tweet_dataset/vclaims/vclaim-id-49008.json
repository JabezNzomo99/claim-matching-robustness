The images are from Carrickfergus in July 2015.\n\nA still image from the BBC News appears in widely shared and copied Facebook posts, showing a Nazi flag flying below the Union flag on a lamppost near a UDA logo. The text below the image states that:\n\n\u201cLoyalists out today celebrating VE day when in some of their own areas they fly Nazi flags. You can\u2019t teach that level of stupidity.\u201d\n\nText in the Facebook posts often adds that \u201cLoyalists celebrating VE Day in Belfast. They are also flying Nazi flags and Israeli flags in the same areas. Irony is definitely not lost on them.\u201d\n\nAnother version suggests: \u201cOnly in Belfast can you see VE day flags, Nazi flags and Israel flags on the same poll. Some serious political confusion there.\u201d\n\nThe earliest recent use of this image (with the red and white BBC News icon added) was on Twitter on 8 May 2020. Later versions add the textual comments underneath.\n\nA search for \u2018BBC News Nazi flag Belfast\u2019 brings up an article about Carrickfergus, as one of the top results.\n\nThe image is from a BBC News article from 8 July 2015, about members of the community taking down Nazi flags that had been erected on lamp posts on the Glenfield estate in Carrickfergus.\n\nYou also can see the UDA sign on the side of the building beside the electricity substation on the junction of Oakland Drive and Sullatober Close in the Glenfield Estate in Carrickfergus on Google Street View. Note the double roofline of the building behind the UDA sign, which matches that in the image published in the BBC\u2019s article in 2015.\n\nThe image being shared clearly predates VE Day in 2020 and is not from Belfast.\n\nFactCheckNI is Northern Ireland\u2019s first and only dedicated independent fact-checking service and a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network\u2019s Code of Principles.
