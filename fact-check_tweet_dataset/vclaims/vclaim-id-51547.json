The claim is false; viruses can kill people and a dysfunctional immune system does not cause death, experts say.\n\nThe claim was published by a Papua New Guinea-based Facebook user here on July 31, 2020. The post has been shared more than 160 times.\n\nThe Facebook post contains a purported quote from \"Dr Shiva Ayyadurai\" that \u201cviruses do not harm or kill us\u201d.\n\nThe post goes on to claim: \u201cIt is the overreaction of a weakened and dysfunctional immune system to the virus that results in our own body attacking its own cells, tissues, organs - resulting in harm and death.\u201d\n\nIt adds: \u201cOur human body contains 380 trillion viruses, 60 trillion bacteria's, and 6 trillion cells\u201d.\n\nThe post circulated during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The first major outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. As of August 6, the virus has infected more than 18.8 million people and killed an estimated 707,000 people, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\nThe Facebook post ends claiming that \u201cthe #coronavirus fear mongering by the Deep State will go down in history as one of the biggest fraud [sic] to manipulate economies, suppress dissent, & push MANDATED Medicine!\u201d\n\nA similar claim was also shared hundreds of times on Facebook here, here and here.\n\nThe claim, however, is false, experts say.\n\nUniversity of New South Wales virologist Dr Sacha Stelzer-Braid told AFP that a weakened or deficient immune system is not what kills people who become infected by viruses.\n\n\u201cPathogenic viruses can infect any human cell that has the right receptor that the virus is looking for and these are present regardless of the underlying medical condition a person has,\u201d Dr Stelzer-Braid said in an August 4 email. \u201cIt is not a dysfunction of the immune system that causes death.\u201d\n\nJose Villadangos, a professor of immunology at the University of Melbourne, also refuted the claim, explaining that \u201chumans become sick in large part due to a NORMAL reaction of the immune system against infection -- that\u2019s how the immune system is supposed to work.\u201d\n\nVilladangos added in an August 4 email that only in \u201crare cases does the immune system overreact in a way that makes the remedy worse than the illness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is happening in severe COVID-19 patients but does not happen in the vast majority of infections with SARS-CoV-2 or with any other virus,\u201d he said.\n\nUNSW postdoctoral researcher Dr Ki Wook Kim said the false Facebook post\u2019s allusion to trillions of viruses present in the human body is likely a reference to bacteriophage, which is a type of virus that infects bacteria.\n\nBacteriophage \u201care incapable of infecting or replicating in human cells,\u201d Dr Kim explained in an email to AFP.\n\nUNSW\u2019s Dr Stelzer-Braid said bacteriophage do not cause disease in humans and instead \u201cplay an important role in regulating the amount of bacteria in our body\u201d.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked more than 570 pieces of false or misleading information related to the novel coronavirus crisis.
