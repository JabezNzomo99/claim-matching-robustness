Contacts taken from that administrator\u2019s phone formed the basis for the mass detentions that followed, said Kochetkov.\n\n\u201cPersecution of men and women suspected of being gay never stopped. It\u2019s only that its scale has been changing,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother LGBTI social media group operating in the region released a statement asking members to \u201cleave the republic as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nAlvi Karimov, Press Secretary for Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, told Interfax news agency on Monday, January 14, that there had not and could not have been detentions on the basis of sexual orientation in Chechnya during that time frame.\n\nThe truth remains unclear, largely due to a lack of transparency in Chechnya. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) last year included Kadyrov on its list of \"Predators of Press Freedom,\u201d noting Chechnya has no opposition media.\n\n\"The very few journalists who still dare to defy the official consensus and obligatory pro-government enthusiasm are warned or threatened, and pressure is put on relatives,\" RSF said.\n\nKadyrov himself famously told HBO \"Real Sports\u201d correspondent David Scott \"we don't have any gays\u201d in Chechnya.\n\n\"If there are any, take them to Canada. Praise be to God. Take them far from us so we don't have them at home. To purify our blood,\" Kadyrov said.\n\nPersecution of homosexual men in Chechnya has been reported and verified in the past by news organizations and human rights advocates.\n\nAmnesty International, citing the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported in early April 2017 that more than 100 men suspected of being gay had been abducted in Chechnya as part of a \u201ccoordinated campaign.\u201d\n\nThose men were reportedly subjected to torture and ill-treatment, and also forced to disclose the identity of other LGBTI individuals.\n\n\u201cNovaya Gazeta claimed to have verified information about at least three men who had been killed by their captors, but its sources claim that there have been many more killings,\u201d Amnesty wrote.\n\nApart from mass detentions, Novaya Gazeta also found evidence of torture and murder of people of different sexual orientations in Chechnya\n\nIn December 2018, the newspaper obtained documents from Russia's Investigative Committee showing that two men, Shoto-Shamil Akayev and Ayub Ibragimov, had been killed with shots to the back of the head at a police station where advocates say homoseuxals were detained.\n\nThat probe by Novaya Gazeta was prompted by a complaint filed by Maksim Lapunov, who claimed he was detained in Chechnya for 12 days in October 2017 because of his sexual orientation. Lapunov said he was held with Akayev and Ibragimov at the same Grozny police facility. After being released, Lapunov met with Akayev\u2019s parents before fleeing Chechnya.\n\nLapunov was the first person to go public with allegations that members of Chechnya\u2019s LGBTI community were being detained and tortured.\n\nChechen police claimed Akayev and Ibragimov were killed during an attempted attack on a police station.\n\nRussian authorities failed to open a criminal investigation based on Lapunov's complaint, saying they could not corroborate his account.\n\nIn July 2018, an official from the Russian Prosecutor-General\u2019s Office, Valery Maksimenko, told a UN committee in Geneva that investigators found no evidence supporting Lapunov\u2019s accusations.\n\nIn May 2018, Russian Justice Minister Aleksandr Konovalov, speaking to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, said officials couldn\u2019t find any gay people in Chechnya, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) reported.\n\nLast October, Tanya Lokshina, associate director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch, told RFE/RL that Lapunov\u2019s case had stalled due to a \u201clack of political will.\"\n\nBut in November, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) invoked paragraph 12 of the 1991 Moscow Document of the Conference on the Human Dimension of the OSCE (Moscow Mechanism) to establish a mission of experts to address reports of human rights violations in Chechnya.\n\nThe OSCE rapporteur was tasked with looking into \u201callegations of impunity for reported human rights violations and abuses in Chechnya from January 2017 to the present, including but not limited to, violations and abuses against persons based on their perceived or actual sexual orientation or gender identity, as well as against human rights defenders, lawyers, independent media, civil society organizations and others.\u201d\n\nRussia declined to assist in that fact-finding mission, leaving the OSCE rapporteur \u201cto focus on all sources available outside the Russian Federation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe evidence clearly shows that the allegations of very serious human rights violations in the Chechen Republic of the Russian Federation have been found confirmed. This concerns in particular allegations of harassment and persecution, arbitrary or unlawful arrests or detentions, torture, enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions. In particular, several waves of violations of human rights and abuses of persons based on their sexual orientation and gender identity in 2017 could be confirmed.\u201d\n\nIt is in thIS context that the latest allegations of persecution are made. So while the verdict, at this time, is unclear \u2013 Polygraph.info will seek more information, and continue to seek verification.", "lang": "en"}
