Other misleading posts combine the same photo with claims it shows the result of hot weather in other locations, or a forest fire. All the claims are false; the cars were melted by heat from a construction site fire in the US city of Tucson in June 2018.\n\nThis Facebook post, published on June 12, 2019, contains a photo of two dark-coloured parked cars with melted rear bumpers and tail lights.\n\nThe post has a Hindi-language caption, which translates as: \u201cIn Saudi Arabia, temperatures went up to 62 degree Celsius as reports are coming in of cars parked in the sun have their fiber parts melting.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe same photo has also been shared on Facebook here and here in June 2019 with the caption: \u201cToday It Was 52\u00b0C In Saudia Arabia\u201d.\n\nOther Facebook posts, for example this one published June 28, 2018, say the cars were \u201cmelted by scorching heat in Oman\u201d; this post says the cars \"melted in 62 degree heat\u201d but does not say where.\n\nAnd this Facebook post, published June 24, 2018, and shared more than 950 times since, combines the same photo with the caption: \u201cHot Temprature in Arizona due to fire in forest is melting cars\u201d.\n\nThe same photo was also published in this tweet on June 22, 2018 with an incorrect claim that the cars melted due to the weather.\n\nAll these claims are false; the photo actually shows cars melted by a fire at a construction site in Tuscon, Arizona.\n\nReverse image searches on Google and keyword searches on Facebook found the same photo published in this Facebook post on June 20, 2018.\n\nThe caption states: \"From across the street where the student housing construction project fire happened last night.\"\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo in the Facebook post:\n\nKeyword searches on Google found this report about a fire in the US city of Tuscon, Arizona, by Tucson News Now, a local news organisation based in Tucson also published on June 22, 2018.\n\nThe report, dated June 22, 2018, is headlined: \u201cConstruction site fire in Tucson results in $8-10 million in damages\".\n\nIt states, in part: \u201cThe blaze was so hot and bright, it lit up the morning sky and melted cars in a parking lot next door\u201d.\n\nBelow is an image comparing the photo in the misleading Facebook posts (L) with a screenshot of the Tucson News Now report (R), which includes a photo taken from a different angle of one of the melted cars. AFP has circled the matching section in yellow:\n\nMultiple video reports from the same fire in Tucson by local news channel KGUN9 were published online here on June 19, 2018.\n\nHere is a Facebook video post by the Tucson Fire department showing the intensity of the fire.\n\nThe caption of the video, which is embedded below, says: \u201cAn on-scene look at what our crews battled early this morning during a two alarm fire.\n\n\"Cranes, cars, trees, and buildings were all damaged due to the extreme temperatures but most importantly, no one was injured\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
