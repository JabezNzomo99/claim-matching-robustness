The bridge yet to be completed already has cracks in it, raising questions over its quality. How is this happening when this is taking place under the guidance of a BJP leader? (Hope that ) the accident that took place in Varanasi is not repeated here.\"\n\nHowever, the same photo was earlier shared in 2016 and 2017 as Delhi Metro and Hyderabad Metro respectively.\n\nFact-checker SM Hoaxslayer traced the image in July 2016 to Pakistan along the Rawalpindi to Islamabad Metro line.\n\nAt the time of writing this story, Singh's tweet had nearly 500 replies from Twitter users who pointed out that it was fake.\n\nBut it was Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan who had the last word as he posted both photos and tweeted that let alone on the ground, they (Congress) couldn't even build a bridge on their Twitter handle.", "lang": "en"}
