In a broadcast, Lt. Kelly Ondo Obiang encouraged Gabonese to rise up and \u201crestore democracy.\u201d \u201cIf you are eating, stop; if you are having a drink, stop; if you are sleeping, wake up. Wake up your neighbors. \u2026 Rise up as one and take control of the street,\u201d Obiang said.\n\n\u201cWe did not know what was happening,\u201d said a journalist who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern about government retaliation, \u201cbut some guards secretly told us that the president was still alive because if he died, he would have been buried. But otherwise, there was not a lot of official information, which was scary.\u201d\n\nJessye Ella Ekogha, the current presidential spokesman \u2014 the previous official is in jail on corruption allegations \u2014 told The Fact Checker that although he was not there at the time, he believes the government did not want to \u201cthrow fuel on the fire\u201d by responding to the rumors.\n\nBut as the days passed, the country anxiously awaited to see whether Bongo would give a New Year\u2019s address. Reports said he would, and on Dec. 31, 2018, he did \u2014 from Morocco. It was Bongo\u2019s first public statement since the rumors started. Some in Gabon took the video as proof that Bongo was alive, but others questioned its authenticity and Bongo\u2019s fitness to govern.\n\n\u201cHe has a great deal of facial makeup, and I think he probably had Botox because neither side of his face is moving,\u201d Dromerick told The Fact Checker after watching the video. \u201cIf you look at his eye, the distance between the upper lid and the lower lid is greater on the right than the left. And that\u2019s an indication of facial weakness.\u201d\n\nBut not everyone was convinced that the president\u2019s strange appearance was health-related. Some thought the man in the video was a look-alike. Elvine Belinda Andjembe Etogho, spokesperson for the Gabonese Council of Resistance, said there were opposition members who tried to prove that the video was a \u201cdeepfake\u201d or manipulated by artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Fact Checker asked Steve Grobman, the chief technology officer at the cyberdefense firm McAfee, to analyze the video. He and his team ran it through two forensic tests, and both came back with nearly a 92 percent probability of being authentic. But he warned that the analysis is not conclusive.\n\n\u201cWe barely see him. We never hear him. You can tell that he\u2019s paralyzed,\u201d Etogho said. \u201cSo you understand that because of all of that \u2026 and the lying, yeah, I can see how the coup came out of that.\u201d\n\nThere were many theories as to why the president appeared changed in the New Year\u2019s address. The soldiers were of the opinion that Bongo was being propped up by those around him \u2014 not that the video was a deepfake. They didn\u2019t trust that Bongo was in control.\n\nBut shortly after Obiang read his statement, his uprising was thwarted. The plotters were either arrested or killed. And Bongo has since made public appearances \u2014 but has undergone an undeniable physical change. He\u2019s pushed for the detainment of officials in an anti-corruption crackdown and appointed his son as a top presidential aide. Opposition leader Jean Ping was reported as saying that this move confirms that Gabon is \u201cturning into a monarchy.\u201d\n\nBut the consequences of months of confusion and rumors are still felt in Gabon today. The opposition has asked the courts to rule on Bongo\u2019s ability to govern, Bongo\u2019s health is under constant scrutiny, and some critics still spread online conspiracy theories that he\u2019s dead. This chain of events is an example of how easy it is in this age of suspect information for governments to lose credibility.", "lang": "en"}
