However, this is a FALSE story.\n\nDr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, former Minister of Finance has reacted over the incessant killings in Nigeria by the Fulani Herdsmen. When the news originally surfaced, the former Minister and now Board member of African Risk Capacity (ARC) had spoken about the killings by the herdsmen which occurred in Plateau State on Sunday, 24th June, 2018; an attack which claimed the lives of over 100 people.\n\nIn a twitter post, she called on Nigerians to cry out over the barbaric killings perpetrated by the Fulani herdsmen. In her words:\n\n\u201cDevastating to see the killings of innocent men, women and children in various parts of the country. We must cry out! Every Nigerian life matters. How can we protect and value every life in the country?\u201d\n\nAt no point in her online history did Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala make the other claim attributed to her by Exclusive103.com. Rather, it is a false headline with misleading content.\n\nThe former Minister is not new to having claims and quotes attributed to her as she had pointed out severally through her twitter handle, and in the process warned the public about the existence of such fake claims.\n\nIn July 10, 2018 through her twitter account, she warned politicians to stop using her name to spread fake news.\n\n\u201cEach candidate should run on the credibility of their persons and performance, without adding my name to their political campaign\u2019\u2019, she said.\n\nIn August 8, 2018, she also warned against using her name as, in her words, \u201ca credibility pole vault\u201d.\n\nAgain in August 14, 2018, she displayed five fake facebook accounts people attributed to her as follows: (1) facebook.com/amaka.chukwuma (2) facebook.com/ngozie.okonjoiw (3) facebook.com/ngozi.okonja (4) facebook.com/chidimna.glory (5) facebook.com/NgoziOkonjoIwe\n\nShe had also through a statement issued by her spokesperson, Paul Nwabuikwu on October 21, 2018 warned the public about fake news about her, and in some cases, attributed to her!\n\nOur Last Words: Always crosscheck the authenticity of any quotes, articles, audios and videos attributed to influential people!\n\nEbere Agozie is a Senior Correspondent with the News Agency of Nigeria(NAN) with a staff strength of about 880, Joined in 2014 as a correspondent.
