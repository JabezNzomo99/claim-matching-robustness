Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Sept. 17 made a similar point on NBC\u2019s\u201cMeet the Press,\u201d but with different numbers than Merkley: \u201cPrivate insurance companies in this country spend between 12 and 18 percent on administration costs\u2026 The cost of administering the Medicare program, a very popular program that works well for our seniors, is 2 percent.\u201d He then claimed: \u201cWe can save approximately $500 billion a year just in administration costs.\u201d\n\nWe had started this fact check by focusing on Merkley, before Sanders appeared on television. But when we started to question Merkley\u2019s numbers, his staff offered a forthright mea culpa: \u201cHe made the numbers up on the spot. He just got confused,\u201d said spokesman Ray Zaccaro, noting it was a live interview. \u201cWhatever he said was completely unrelated to whatever material we were given\u201d by the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee.\n\nIf you look at the annual trustees report, it lists $9.2 billion in \u201cadministrative expenses.\u201d That\u2019s certainly less than 2 percent of total expenditures, and it does include assistance provided by some other parts of the government such as the Treasury Department and Health and Human Services in fighting fraud and collecting premiums. Within the trustees report, Table IIIB1 lists salaries and expenses for departmental personnel, as well as reimbursements of departments for general revenues expended to administer Medicare. (Note: an earlier version of this article incorrectly said that some of these functions were not reflected in that line item.)\n\nBut when Mark Litow, a former health actuary at Milliman Inc., looked at the issue in 2006 for a now-defunct industry group, he concluded that Medicare\u2019s administrative costs were actually 5.2 percent when hidden expenses were included. While he has not studied the issue recently, he said the percentage was probably higher now. \u201cGovernment systems are designed to make it look cheap, but they are expensive,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMany people incorrectly assume that the majority of the remaining 18 cents goes toward activities like claims processing, member outreach, and quality reporting,\u201d Grow said. \u201cIt\u2019s true that this 18 cents does include those activities \u2014 which would need to be done even under a single payer system.\u201d But she says it also includes things such as nurse hotlines, case managers, network management and maintenance, customer service operations, and federal, state, and local taxes and fees.\n\nThe article estimated Medicare overhead was 2.2 percent and private insurance coverage was 12.4 percent in 2017. Reducing overhead to Medicare\u2019s level would yield $220 billion, the article said. But it calculates an additional $225 billion in savings would be found in reductions in the cost of hospital administration and doctor office administration; an additional $59 billion would come from administrative savings in nursing homes, home-care agencies and other areas.\n\nSome experts, particularly on the right, say these estimates are measuring the wrong thing. Medicare patients are elderly and thus have high costs relative to administrative expenses, especially compared to the under-65 patients in private plans. So just looking at percentage of each dollar spent skews the result. A better method, these experts say, is to look at administrative costs per patient.\n\nRobert Book, a health economist affiliated with the right-leaning American Action Forum, studied this question in 2009 for the Heritage Foundation, looking at administrative costs per person between 2000 and 2005. Measured as a percentage of total costs, Medicare appeared more efficient in 2005, 5.8 percent of expenses compared to 13.2 percent for private insurance. But it was more expensive on a per-person basis: \u201cIn 2005, Medicare\u2019s administrative costs were $509 per primary beneficiary, compared to private-sector administrative costs of $453,\u201d he concluded.\n\n\u201cAs percentage of total costs is inherently misleading,\u201d Book said in an interview. \u201cThe patients in Medicare have higher medical costs. Medicare is always going to win, not because they are more efficient but because you are asking the wrong question.\u201d He has not tried to do a more recent comparison, though he concluded in 2016 that the Affordable Care Act appears to have raised per-person administrative costs when government expenditures are included.\n\n\u201cMedicare\u2019s administrative cost percentages look illusorily low in large part because they are percentages of per-capita expenditures that are atypically high, relative to those seen in the private sector,\u201d said Charles Blahous, a former public trustee for Medicare and Social Security. \u201cSeniors have higher health expenditures per capita than the younger individuals insured in private sector plans. Thus, the lower administrative cost percentages in Medicare don\u2019t by themselves imply that extending a Medicare-style system to participants of all ages would produce a system with similarly low administrative costs. In fact, one can predict fairly certainly that wouldn\u2019t be the case.\u201d\n\nBut even if Democrats were to be conservative and say Medicare had administrative costs of 5 percent and private plans 12 percent, previous estimates of the administrative costs per patient indicate that Medicare is actually more inefficient than private insurance. We would be interested to see more recent calculations on this issue, but it certainly indicates that single-payer advocates are counting savings that might not materialize. Democrats should be cautious with this talking point to avoid Pinocchios in the future.", "lang": "en"}
