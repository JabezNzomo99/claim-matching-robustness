Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass, announced in January that she had alopecia, a meanspirited image appeared on Facebook purporting to show another Democratic congresswoman without hair.\n\n\"Ilhan Omar hates this picture and she hates when people share it,\" reads the text above two images of Omar, one in which she\u2019s wearing her usual head scarf and another in which she appears to have two small tufts of hair without it. \"Let\u2019s piss her off.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nJeremy Slevin, a spokesman for Omar, told us the image that makes Omar appear as if she were photographed without a headscarf isn\u2019t authentic.\n\nRather, it seems the image was altered using this photo of a man wanted for a parole violation in South Wales. His distinctive hairline was mocked online after police posted his mugshot on Facebook.\n\nWe rate this Facebook post Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
