Scott Walker, rolling out a blistering economic critique in her opening statement.\n\nBeyond the expected reference to Walker\u2019s failure to spur creation of 250,000 jobs as he promised, Burke unveiled a new talking point.\n\n\"His approach isn\u2019t working,\" she said Oct. 10, 2014. \"The typical Wisconsin family has actually seen their real income drop by nearly $3,000 in the last four years. $3,000!\"\n\nNot so fast, the Republican Party of Wisconsin countered, quickly issuing a news release with this headline: \"Mary Burke Opens Her Disastrous Debate Appearance With A New Lie.\"\n\nLet\u2019s go to the Truth-O-Meter.\n\nWhen asked for backup, the Burke campaign cited income figures reported by the Wisconsin Council on Children & Families following the Sept. 17, 2014 release of data through the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey.\n\nThe American Community Survey is the preferred method for tracking year-to-year changes in median household income at the state level. It is based on a random sampling of residents from every state.\n\nThe income figures are adjusted for inflation, allowing apples-to-apples comparisons over time. Burke called it \"real\" income, the technical term for the inflation-adjusted approach.\n\nThe most recent survey year reported 2013 income. So to track the four-year trend, as Burke did, you have to start with 2009 as a baseline and measure changes across 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013.\n\nBurke\u2019s camp did just that -- but there\u2019s a problem with the method, as we shall see in a moment.\n\nThat $2,743 drop was big enough drop to be statistically significant, even when considering the survey\u2019s margin of error, census officials told us.\n\nAnd Burke describes it as \"nearly $3,000\" -- a characterization generally on target, though that $257 difference is not insubstantial.\n\nThere\u2019s trouble here, though, for Burke.\n\nShe associates Walker, and Walker alone, with the four-year period she discusses. That sounds reasonable on the surface; the governor\u2019s term is four years, and it\u2019s ending.\n\nBut there\u2019s no 2014 data yet, so to get four full years Burke has to dip back into the final year (2010) of Walker\u2019s Democratic predecessor, Gov. Jim Doyle.\n\nIn other words, the census data she cites covers one year from the Doyle era and three years of Walker\u2019s time.\n\nIndeed, most of the income drop Burke cites was in 2010, Doyle\u2019s final year, when the median household income fell $1,893 or 3.5 percent.\n\nThe drop under Walker, in his first three years, amounts to $850, or 1.6 percent.\n\nThe blame game on economic matters is tricky under the best circumstances. The lingering effects of the national recession, Walker\u2019s cuts to public workers\u2019 disposable income, his tax cuts, the below-average pace of job creation, the national economy -- all those factors and more play into fluctuations in income.\n\nBut in this instance Burke blames Walker for something that largely occurred before his watch, providing a distorted view for voters.\n\nSaying that his approach hasn\u2019t worked, Burke blamed Walker for income losses, saying, \"the typical Wisconsin family has actually seen their real income drop by nearly $3,000 in the last four years.\"\n\nWhile median household income in Wisconsin has fallen $2,743 in four years, most of the drop occurred before Walker took office in 2011,\n\nWe rate the claim Mostly False.\n\nTo comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s web page.", "lang": "en"}
