Deal the same way. You say you got to invest here in the United States and you want to be able to invest here, and you say, \u201cWe want to invest in China but you got to have a 51 percent owner?\u201d No deal, man. Deal for deal. 50 percent. Cuomo: This administration\u2019s fighting that same fight, isn\u2019t it? Biden: But they\u2019re not. No. They\u2019re fighting in trade. Trump thinks it\u2019s about trade deficits and trade surpluses. It\u2019s not about that.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign said the former vice president\u2019s point was that Trump has been \u201cfixated\u201d on the trade deficit with China \u201cat the expense of the more impactful structural issues,\u201d such as China\u2019s \u201csystematic theft of American intellectual property and trade secrets.\u201d\n\nBut Biden went too far when he told Cuomo the Trump administration isn\u2019t fighting back on the intellectual property issue.\n\nIndeed, Trump has focused a great deal of attention on trade deficits with China \u2014 a concern not shared by many economists. But the president often marries the trade deficit issue with the need to protect intellectual property rights. (Biden mentioned two intellectual property issues: cyberespionage, or \u201cstealing intellectual secrets,\u201d as he put it, and forced technology transfer, which is when China forces foreign companies into joint ventures in order to do business in its country. Those are different things.)\n\nBoth forms of infringement on intellectual property rights have been integral parts of the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing trade negotiations with China.\n\nThe administration has cited intellectual property right abuses as a reason for some of the tariffs it has levied on China. The Office of the United States Trade Representative\u2019s official findings that resulted in a tariff in March 2018 cited China\u2019s continuing \u201cpolicy and practice, spanning more than a decade, of conducting and supporting cyber-enabled theft and intrusions into the commercial networks of U.S. companies.\u201d\n\nIn June 2018, the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy issued a 36-page paper, \u201cHow China\u2019s Economic Aggression Threatens the Technologies and Intellectual Property of the United States and the World.\u201d\n\nA Jan. 31 statement from the president on trade talks with China noted that while the two sides \u201cdiscussed the need to reduce the enormous and growing trade deficit that the United States has with China,\u201d the talks \u201ccovered a wide range of issues.\u201d The statement listed seven points of discussion, including \u201cthe ways in which United States companies are pressured to transfer technology to Chinese companies, \u2026 the need for stronger protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights in China,\u201d and \u201cthe harm resulting from China\u2019s cyber-theft of United States commercial property.\u201d\n\nIn a press conference this year before a bilateral meeting with China\u2019s Vice Premier Liu He on April 4, Trump was asked what was left to agree on in the trade negotiations between the two nations. Trump responded, \u201cWe\u2019re talking intellectual property protection and theft. We\u2019re talking about certain tariffs. \u2026 When we first started, people would say, \u2018Well, you\u2019ll never talk about intellectual property. You\u2019ll never talk about a vast array of elements.\u2019 Every one of them is not only talked about, but highly negotiated.\u201d\n\nAn April 5 statement from the White House on China trade talks reiterated that point, stating, \u201cThe subjects of the negotiation included intellectual property, forced technology transfer, non-tariff barriers, agriculture, services, purchases, and enforcement.\u201d\n\nWhen trade talks between the two nations broke down in May, Trump said it was in part because China reneged on issues related to intellectual property theft.\n\nTrump repeated that claim in a press conference the following month.\n\nIn addition to the issue being included in trade talks, the Justice Department and the FBI have also sought to crack down on economic espionage by Chinese hackers.\n\n\u201cThe F.B.I. has increased its scrutiny of Chinese researchers in the United States over fears they may be acquiring intellectual secrets,\u201d the New York Times reported in May. \u201cA Justice Department initiative is targeting commercial espionage of American technology, and earlier this year the United States unveiled a sweeping indictment of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, over accusations of stealing trade secrets and evading American sanctions on Iran.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the Times noted, the U.S. has sought to end forced technology transfers.\n\n\u201cThe United States has been erecting barriers to limit Chinese investment in American companies, re-examining the kinds of technology that can be exported to China and restricting China\u2019s role in building America\u2019s next-generation telecommunications networks, while also discouraging other countries from using Chinese equipment,\u201d the paper reported.\n\nIn November 2017, the South China Morning Post reported that after a meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, China announced that it would begin relaxing limits on foreign ownership of joint ventures in China\u2019s financial services and life insurance sectors. According to the report, \u201cForeign firms will be allowed to hold a majority stake in joint ventures with mainland Chinese securities companies and life insurance joint ventures, and caps on foreign banks\u2019 stakes in Chinese banks and asset managers would be removed.\u201d\n\nIn other words, there is a lot of evidence that the Trump administration is trying to thwart China\u2019s theft of intellectual property.\n\n\u201cThe enforcement of U.S. intellectual property rights by China in China is a major position of the Trump administration,\u201d Stuart Malawer, a professor of law and international trade at George Mason University, told us via email. \u201cThis is in addition to Trump\u2019s fixation on trade surpluses generally.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration is definitely pressing China on its failure to protect intellectual property,\u201d Simon Lester, a trade policy analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute, told us via email. \u201cWhat Biden was probably trying to say is that the administration\u2019s approach to dealing with China is not very effective and that the administration misunderstands the basic economics of trade. But he didn\u2019t say it very coherently.\u201d\n\nThe Biden campaign pointed to two news stories reporting that the incidents of cybertheft by China \u2014 stemmed after a deal struck with President Barack Obama in 2015 \u2014 reemerged after Trump took office.\n\nAndrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, argued that it is \u201cimperative for the United States to work together with our allies \u2014 who also suffer from China\u2019s trade abuses \u2014 to bring collective pressure to bear and achieve a decisive end to these violations.\u201d Instead, he said, Trump has \u201calienated our allies by imposing tariffs on them.\u201d\n\nBiden is free to argue that Trump is going about things all wrong, and that the president should enlist rather than alienate allies to tackle the issue of intellectual property theft by China, or that Trump\u2019s tactics have backfired. That\u2019s opinion, and we take no position on that. But he is wrong to say the Trump administration isn\u2019t doing anything on the intellectual property front.", "lang": "en"}
