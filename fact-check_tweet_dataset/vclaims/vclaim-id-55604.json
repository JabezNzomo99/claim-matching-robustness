Strong actions should be taken against these officers immediately.\u201d The video was circulated on Twitter as well. The video dates back to 2017 and has been shared with a false context. The man assaulted by the police was allegedly drunk and the video is not related to checking of any vehicle. In the video, one can clearly see \u2018Gaur\u2019 station written at the location of the incident, which falls in the Basti district of Uttar Pradesh. On conducting a Google reverse image search with key words \u201cGaur police basti man assaulted\u201d, we found a report by The Times of India with the video which was published in 2017. The man was allegedly drunk and instead of booking him under relevant sections of IPC, the police personnel physically thrashed him in public, the report said. The YouTube channel of the media house had also uploaded the video.\n\nWe then searched for the police\u2019s version and found a tweet by Basti police, which was made days after the video went viral, as a reply to the latter. Calling the incident \"old\u201d and \u201cdating back to 2017\u201d, the Basti police clarified that it has nothing to do with the checking of any vehicle and that the cops in the video were wearing a \u201cwinter\u201d uniform, whereas it is summer right now. However, no information was shared about whether any follow-up action was taken against the cops in the video or why the incident took place in the first place.
