It\u2019s preserved in this tweet.\n\nIn the video, TikTok user Hannah Stater said in part, \"Central Park actually used to be a town called Seneca Village that was founded by freed African American slaves in 1825.\" She added that the residents were evicted and that this history is not well known because it\u2019s \"uncomfortable.\"\n\nFrom 1825 to 1857, Seneca Village consisted of the land between 82nd and 89th Streets and 7th and 8th Avenues.\n\nThe land was purchased by a white couple, John and Elizabeth Whitehead, in 1824. It was soon subdivided into smaller plots.\n\nColumbia University's Seneca Village Project has identified Seneca Village as the first significant community of African American property owners in Manhattan.\n\nOn Sept. 27,1825, Andrew Williams, a young African American, purchased three lots from the Whiteheads for $125.\n\nThe same day, trustees of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church purchased six lots near 86th Street. Those trustees included Epiphany Davis, an African American store clerk, who purchased twelve lots for $578.\n\nThese transactions provided the nucleus for Seneca Village. There were three churches, a school and several cemeteries.\n\nThe land \"was occupied by various groups, including the African American and Irish residents of Seneca Village, as well as scattered small German farmers and Irish households,\" Elizabeth Blackmar, a Columbia University historian, told PolitiFact.\n\nBy 1855, the community had grown to 264 residents, as German and Irish immigrants integrated into the village, according to the New York Times.\n\nHow did Seneca Village become Central Park?\n\nBy the 1840s, lower Manhattan, the original core of the city, had become unsanitary and overcrowded. Affluent and civic-minded New Yorkers grew concerned that commerce and industry were sullying the island. According to the New-York Historical Society, some leading residents resented an influx of poor immigrants and considered how to create new neighborhoods for wealthier New Yorkers.\n\nBetween 1849 and 1853, New Yorkers debated how a \"grand\" park might be constructed to stretch from midtown to northern Manhattan could be created.\n\n\"In the summer of 1853, the city government authorized taking the land between 59th and 106th Streets, between Fifth and Eighth Avenues, to lay grounds for a public park. The city claimed the right of \u2018eminent domain,\u2019 which permits the state to take private land for public use, with compensation afforded to the land owners,\" wrote the New-York Historical Society.\n\nSeneca Village was directly in the path of the planned park.\n\n\"All residents were forced to vacate beginning in 1856,\" the historical society wrote, \"Approximately 1,600 people, spread over 7,500 lots of land, were directly affected by this decision. Nearly 300 of them lived in Seneca Village.\"\n\nThe New-York Historical Society has noted that to ease evictions, popular newspapers and magazines at the time portrayed the site of the future park as a \"wasteland\" occupied by \"squatters,\" \"shanties,\" \"bloodsuckers\" and \"insects.\" But many of the residents fought to keep their land and requested higher compensation.\n\nUltimately, Seneca Village residents were given final notice to leave in the summer of 1856. Residents were compensated for their land, but many didn\u2019t want to leave or said their land was undervalued in the process, according to a history from the Central Park Conservancy.\n\n\"That's how Central Park was made, with most newspapers cheering the removal of \u2018the insects,\u2019\" wrote the New York Times.\n\nWhat happened to the residents?\n\nSome Seneca Village residents moved to different parts of the city, to Long Island, or out of New York state. Williams\u2019 family ultimately settled in California.\n\n\"By 1857, a substantial community with deep spiritual and familial ties\u2014 some that went back more than thirty years\u2014had vanished without leaving much evidence of its past,\" the New-York Historical Society wrote.\n\nThe TikTok video said, \"Central Park actually used to be a town called Seneca Village\" founded by African Americans in 1825.\n\nMany of the earliest residents of Seneca Village were African Americans, and they were evicted through eminent domain before the park was built.\n\nThe brief history on the TikTok does leave out some of the details, including that Irish and German immigrants were also residents of Seneca Village and that Seneca Village only accounted for a fraction of what became Central Park.\n\nBut the gist of the story is accurate.
