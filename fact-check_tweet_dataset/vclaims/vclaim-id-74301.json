So if it ban it will come all set after 2-3 days with mob lynching and Rafale plane updates.\u201d So no worry about ban as India can only ban Tencent not PUBG as PUBG is North Korean.\u201d\n\nMore such posts can be seen here and here.\n\nALSO READ: Fact Check: Is this the interior of PM Modi\u2019s new aircraft?\u2026\n\nWe fact checked the claims and found them to be false.\n\nThe red flag in the first two posts were some very glaring elements such as \u2018YouTube CEO Elon Musk\u2019 and the image of Jeff Bezos when the post actually talks about Elon Musk.\n\nA simple Google search reveals that YouTube CEO is Susan Wojcicki, as also mentioned in the below Forbes article.\n\nA Google reverse image search reveals that the man in the picture above is Jeff Bezos.\n\nThe quote attributed to YouTube CEO in the post was also grammatically incorrect which was another red flag.\n\nAfter these basic errors, we checked whether PUBG is a North Korean app, as the posts above claim. We Googled \u2018PUBG origin\u2019 and found the below The Indian Express article from July 31, 2020.\n\nIt states: PUBG is a battle royale game developed by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean video game company Bluehole.\n\nThe article also states that in 2018, After becoming extremely popular on the PC side, Tencent Games, from China and the PUBG Corporation partnered up to release a mobile version of the game for Android and iOS in 2018.\n\nThis indicates that the Chinese firm Tencent Games does not independently control PUBG. In the entire article or other media reports, there is no mention of North Korea.\n\nThis article by Times Now states that Tencent owns only 10% stake in South Korean PUBG Corporation, formerly known as Bluehole, which is the parent organization of PUBG.\n\nWe also then visited the official website for Bluehole, which took us to krafton.com. In the history section, we found all the information as also mentioned in the articles.\n\nOne of the first events in the timeline was Bluehole setting up in Pangyo in 2007. Google Maps shows that the place is in South Korea.\n\nOn the history page for 2017, Bluehole talks about releasing PUBG and changing its corporate name to PUBG Corporation.\n\nIn 2018, it mentions its strategic partnership with Tencent and changing its name to Krafton.\n\nWe traced PUBG\u2019s entire history through its website and media reports and all sources confirmed that the app was developed by a South Korean company that later tied up with Chinese firm Tencent.\n\nHence, PUBG is not a North Korean App and the claims in the above posts are false.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
