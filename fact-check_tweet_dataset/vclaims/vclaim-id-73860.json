She said it showed Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputies wrongly pointing guns at her 16-year-old son and two of his friends who she says were the victims \u2014 not the perpetrators \u2014 of an assault at a bus stop the day before in Santa Clarita.\n\nThe footage was viewed more than 275,000 times, and sparked a wave of social media posts denouncing the deputies\u2019 actions in the following days, including a tweet that said:\n\nBelow, we lay out an investigation into Collins\u2019 post and the claim that Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputies had indeed held three teenagers at gunpoint after witnesses said the teens themselves were attacked by someone at a bus stop.\n\nWhat Did The Mother\u2019s Video Show?\n\nTo begin, we analyzed Collins\u2019 Instagram video second-by-second. It was unclear whether she recorded the footage herself or if someone shared the footage with her after the incident. The post\u2019s caption read:\n\nHow will I help my son recover from this. I wanted to share what happened to my son yesterday in SCV when he was with a couple of friends sitting at a bus stop headed home. He was attacked by a gentleman (homeless guy) who approached them and first asked them if they had any crack then tried to take their things. The guy became so aggressive that he took his shirt off pulled out a knife and whip them tried to stabbed them. His friends only had their skate boards to cover them from the knife and whip so they held it out to keep distance from this guy. Several bystanders including the restaurant manager of Buffalo Wild wings called the police to get help for the boys but \u201cOne\u201d caller called the police and reported two black guys are attacking a homeless guy. This is how the police responded. \u2026\n\nTo summarize, Collins said the teens were sitting at a bus stop on Aug. 7, 2020, with their skateboards when a man allegedly approached them and asked if they had any crack cocaine. It\u2019s unclear from the Instagram post how the teens responded to the question, but then the man allegedly tried to rob the teenagers, though the post did not provide details about what, exactly, the man tried to steal.\n\nThen, as the encounter escalated, Collins said the man allegedly lunged at the teens with a knife, and they used their skateboards for protection and to separate themselves from the alleged attacker. Witnesses called 911 \u2014 at least one of whom, according to Collins, erroneously told officers, \u201ctwo Black guys are attacking a homeless guy.\u201d\n\nFrom there, according to the video, two deputies drove to the street, got out of a squad vehicle, and pointed firearms in an off-camera direction. Seconds later, at least one other deputy arrived, and he exited his vehicle with what appeared to be a tactical rifle.\n\nMeanwhile, bystanders pleaded with deputies to put away the firearms, and the crowd repeatedly yelled, \u201cIt was the other guy!\u201d in reference to the man Collins alleged attacked the teenagers. Additionally, a witness said she told 911 dispatchers, specifically, there was \u201ca crazy man\u201d with a knife chasing three young skateboarders, and that he \u2014 not the trio of teenagers \u2014 was the problem, per the footage\u2019s audio.\n\nWe should note here: Snopes requested copies of all 911 dispatch audio related to the incident from both the sheriff\u2019s office and attorney Robert Brown, who is representing Collins\u2019 family, and we have not heard back. Under the California Public Records Act, 911 emergency calls must be made public unless specific exemptions apply.\n\nBy about the 1-minute mark of the Instagram video, the recording had showed three deputies pointing firearms \u2014 the rifle and two pistols \u2014 in the same off-camera direction. Then, the camera panned to show the area at which deputies were pointing: an area by a bus stop where two Black teens and one white teen were standing with their hands up.\n\nFollowing deputies\u2019 commands, one of the Black teens wearing black shorts and a dark-blue T-shirt at that point dropped to his knees, put his hands behind his head, and allowed a deputy to handcuff him, the footage showed. The deputy escorted that teen in an off-camera direction, while two other deputies continued pointing guns at the bus stop, where the other two teens remained with their arms raised.\n\nEventually, deputies handcuffed those teens, as well. By about the video\u2019s halfway point, deputies in the camera\u2019s view had seemingly put down their guns.\n\nOne deputy then told the crowd of bystanders that one 911 caller said \u201csomeone was hit with a skateboard,\u201d and the teenagers were taken into custody because of that report. The remainder of the video recorded the witnesses, including Collins, criticizing the deputies\u2019 actions.\n\nAfter that, the teens were reportedly held in deputies\u2019 vehicles for about 30 minutes and then released with no charges, Brown told The Los Angeles Times. They are considering filing a lawsuit over the incident but, as of this writing, no complaint had been filed.\n\n\n\nHow Did The Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s Respond To The Footage?\n\nNext, we contacted the sheriff\u2019s department to learn under what circumstances deputies were called to the bus stop and to discuss if, or to what extent, the deputies\u2019 actions were appropriate from the agency\u2019s perspective and followed department protocol. Deputy Juanita Navarro-Suarez responded to our inquiry with an email that read:\n\nIn other words, the sheriff\u2019s department said deputies went to the bus stop under the impression that two Black men had whacked another man with a skateboard, and that deputies should try to arrest the skateboard-wielding men \u2014 despite witnesses\u2019 claims in the video that at least one person had, in fact, called 911 because someone had attacked the teenagers. The email made no mention of a knife, though it categorized the 911 call as an \u201cassault with a deadly weapon.\u201d\n\nSheriff Alex Villanueva acknowledged the popularity of Collins\u2019 footage in a video statement on Aug. 10, 2020, in which he said he had \u201cconcerns\u201d over the deputies\u2019 actions and that the encounter was under investigation, without elaborating further. He said:\n\nRoughly three hours later, Chief Dennis Kneer of the department\u2019s north patrol division said in a separate video statement that the sheriff launched a review of department policies that govern when, and under what circumstances, deputies should deploy AR-15 rifles, as seen in the video. \u201cWe will thoroughly review our actions related to this incident and take appropriate action as necessary,\u201d Knee said.\n\nWe reviewed the department\u2019s policy manual, which is available online, and learned existing rules on AR-15s require deputies to attend a two-day, 16-hour training at which they complete \u201clive fire exercises\u201d that are designed to teach \u201cthe basic fundamentals\u201d for using the guns on patrol. The manual stated:\n\nIn sum, considering the email from Navarro-Suarez \u2014 which confirmed deputies were indeed investigating an assault at the time of the controversial incident \u2014 as well as the video footage that showed three deputies pointing guns at teenagers, two of whom were Black, and recorded testimonies from bystanders, we rate this claim \u201cTrue.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
