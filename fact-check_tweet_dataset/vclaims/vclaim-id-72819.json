Dave Griffith, R-Jefferson City, proposed a bill that would require the establishment of more veterans treatment courts in Missouri.\n\n\"Every county in the state of Texas has a veterans court,\" he said in a Feb. 12 judiciary committee hearing on veterans treatment courts.\n\nAccording to previous Missourian reporting, Griffith, vice chairman of the Veterans Committee and former Green Beret of the U.S. Army 8th Special Forces Group, said that more veteran treatment courts would make it easier for veterans to reach a court, because some have to drive \"a great deal of a distance\" to follow their program every day.\n\nAccording to Justice for Vets, veterans treatment courts are special courts that provide an alternative to incarceration, offering programs to help veterans in the criminal justice system because of substance abuse or mental health disorders get the help and treatment they need.\n\nWe decided to take a closer look at Griffith\u2019s statement, to check if each county in the state of Texas has a veterans treatment court.\n\nThe origins of the statement\n\nWhen we asked Griffith about his claim, he said he was referring to what he learned from talking with the administrative assistant of the Gonzales County judge in Texas.\n\nGriffith said he was deployed to assist following Hurricane Harvey in the fall of 2017. He worked worked in three counties including Gonzales County.\n\n\"I talked with the judge and his administrative assistant,\" Griffith said. \"His assistant informed me that every county in the state of Texas has a veterans court.\"\n\nWe reached out to Gonzales County to find out more.\n\nCounty Judge C. Patrick Davis took over from Judge David Bird at the beginning of the year.\n\nDavis referred us to Chapter 124 of the Texas Government Code, untitled Veterans Treatment Court Program. But neither this passage of the Texas law nor the judge provided any comment on the number of veterans treatment courts in Texas.\n\nAccording to Texvet, treatment courts are available to veterans across 39 counties in Texas. There are 254 counties in Texas, far more than any other state. Texvet is an initiative of Texas A&M University, which connects veterans and their families to resources and services.\n\nWhen we informed Griffith about our research, he said he didn't have any reason not to believe what the assistant told him. He told us he didn\u2019t check if every county in Texas has a veterans court but still thinks it\u2019s true.\n\nHe clarified: \"Perhaps she was just talking about the counties that were surrounding San Antonio and the counties around there. But I took it as every county in the state had a veterans court.\"\n\nAccording to Veterans Treatment Courts: 2015 Survey Results, a new report by the Justice Programs Office at American University\u2019s School of Public Affairs, Texas had 17 veterans treatment courts programs as of July 2016. According to the same survey, Michigan had the most at 22.\n\nAccording to the National Center for State Courts, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs counted 461 veteran-focused court programs in the U.S. as of June 30, 2016.\n\nHolly Shive, communications coordinator for TexVet, and David B. Tucy, Gonzales Veterans County service officer, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nGriffith said, \"Every county in the state of Texas has a veterans court.\"\n\nBased on data for veterans courts, Texas does not have anywhere near 254 veterans courts, the number of counties in the state. We rate the claim False.", "lang": "en"}
