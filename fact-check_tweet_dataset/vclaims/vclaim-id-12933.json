They\u2019re correctly referencing different sets of figures, but it\u2019s less clear what Ms Ahmed-Sheikh means by record levels of attainment, since she goes on to talk about where pupils go after they leave school.\n\nScotland\u2019s performance in international science and reading tests is falling\n\nLabour confirmed Ms Dugdale was talking about Scotland\u2019s recent performance in the PISA international survey of 15 year-olds\u2019 educational performance.\n\nThe survey showed Scotland\u2019s performance in science and reading falling between 2012 and 2015. While performance in maths hadn\u2019t changed much in that time, it was still lower than scores back in the mid-2000s.\n\nMore pupils going into education, employment or training\n\nMs Ahmed-Sheikh appeared to be backing up her claim about attainment with statistics about the destination of school leavers, which is different. It\u2019s possible that she was making a separate point on attainment without going into detail, so we\u2019ve asked her office to confirm what her initial claim referred to.\n\nOn destinations, she\u2019s correct that, using the available figures, a record proportion of young people are going into education, employment or training.\n\nIn 2015/16, 93.3% of school leavers in Scotland went into higher or further education, paid or unpaid work, training and \u2018activity agreements\u2019. That\u2019s been rising each year, from 90.1% in 2011/12.\n\nThose figures tell us what\u2019s happening to former pupils three months after leaving. There\u2019s usually a follow-up survey after nine months, which tends to show a small drop in pupils going into education, work or training.\n\nMore pupils are leaving school with higher level qualifications\n\nOne other measure of attainment paints a more positive picture, in line with Ms Ahmed-Sheikh\u2019s initial claim.\n\nThe proportion of school leavers in Scotland attaining one or more Higher qualification has been rising since 2006, from just over 40% to around 60%. At the other end of the spectrum there\u2019s a rising proportion of pupils leaving without any passes at level 3 or better.", "lang": "en"}
