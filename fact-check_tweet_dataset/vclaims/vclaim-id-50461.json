But other outlets have also quoted the WHO as denying the story.\n\nThe Telegraph article quotes a WHO spokesperson as saying, in reply to a question about whether banknotes could be spreading the new coronavirus: \u201cYes it\u2019s possible and it\u2019s a good question. We know that money changes hands frequently and can pick up all sorts of bacteria and viruses ... when possible it\u2019s a good idea to use contactless payments\u201d.\n\nWe don\u2019t doubt that the Telegraph\u2019s report is an accurate account of the conversation, but the WHO have since clarified to Full Fact that this did not amount to an official warning about banknotes.\n\nTheir current official advice, received in an email to Full Fact, is below.\n\n\u201cPrevention starts with 10 basic things you can do:\n\u2022 Clean your hands regularly with an alcohol-based hand rub, or wash them with soap and water;\n\u2022 Clean surfaces regularly with disinfectant \u2013 for example kitchen benches and work desks;\n\u2022 Educate yourself about COVID-19. Make sure your information comes from reliable sources;\n\u2022 Avoid traveling if you have a fever or cough, and if you become sick while on a flight, inform the crew immediately. Once you get home, make contact with a health professional and tell them about where you have been;\n\u2022 Cough or sneeze into your sleeve, or use a tissue. Dispose of the tissue immediately into a closed rubbish bin, and then clean your hands;\n\u2022 take extra precautions to avoid crowded areas if you are over 60 years old, or if you have an underlying condition;\n\u2022 If you feel unwell, stay at home and call your doctor or local health professional;\n\u2022 If you are sick, stay at home, and eat and sleep separately from your family, use different utensils and cutlery to eat;\n\u2022 If you develop shortness of breath, call your doctor and seek care immediately;\n\u2022 It\u2019s normal and understandable to feel anxious, especially if you live in a country or community that has been affected.\n\nFind out what you can do in your community. Discuss how to stay safe with your workplace, school or place of worship.\u201d\n\nWe have also written about what to do to avoid infection by Covid-19 here.
