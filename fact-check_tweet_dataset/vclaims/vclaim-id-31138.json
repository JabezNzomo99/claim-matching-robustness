This has since been updated to 13,741.\n\nThe latest data for the 2018/19 financial year shows the number of selected knife offences has increased to 14,902.\n\n\u201cSelected\u201d offences here includes a handful of offences most associated with knife crime: assault, robbery, threats to kill, attempted murder, homicide, rape and sexual assault. These figures only cover what the police record, of course, so can\u2019t tell us about crimes that go unreported.\n\nThe claim that 11,000 of these attacks were carried out by Muslim immigrants is unfounded.\n\nThe police and criminal justice system do not collect data on the religion or immigration status of knife crime offenders so it\u2019s impossible to say how many were Muslims or migrants.\n\nRegardless, the figure is implausible for a few reasons.\n\nData from the Mayor of London\u2019s Office for Policing and Crime found that in 2017 half the knife crime offenders in London were black, Asian or minority ethnic. Which means that half were white.\n\nEven if you were to assume that all ethnic minority knife crime offenders were Muslim immigrants (which is in itself implausible), the claim would still only be plausible if the majority of white knife offenders were Muslim immigrants.\n\nThis pushes the boundaries of possibility. Data from the Annual Population Survey from 2015-2017 shows that only 1% of white people in London were foreign-born Muslims.", "lang": "en"}
