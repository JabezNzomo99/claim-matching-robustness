FBI again confirmed that they do not have any such records by consulting with personnel knowledgeable about Director Comey\u2019s statements and the surveillance activities of the FBI.\u201d\n\nThe memos, among other things, allege that the Russian government had been seeking to split the Western alliance by cultivating and supporting Trump and also gathering compromising information \u2014 \u201ckompromat\u201d \u2014 on him in an effort to blackmail him. The memos, among other allegations, claim that the Russian government fed the Trump campaign \u201cvaluable intelligence\u201d on Clinton. The dossier was eventually circulated within the FBI, and a salacious portion of it was discussed by Comey in his first briefing for Trump.\n\nThe White House began to argue that because Steele was getting information from Russian officials in part with funds provided by the Clinton campaign, the Russians were helping Clinton. Officials also suggested that the whole investigation was tainted because it started with the dossier. But that was undercut by the revelation that the probe actually started because of a report from an Australian diplomat that Papadopoulos appeared to know about the Russian hacking before WikiLeaks began releasing details.\n\nThe Nunes memo suggested that a group of politically biased law enforcement officials set out to sabotage Trump, with the Steele dossier as a key piece of evidence. The memo focused on the FBI application for a wiretap order that targeted Carter Page, a former Trump adviser, after he had left the campaign. The classified memo, which Trump ordered released, claimed that law enforcement officials had abused their powers by failing to make clear that one of the pieces of evidence was the dossier; they claimed it was tainted by political bias because of its Democratic origins.\n\nMeanwhile, the texts between Strzok and Page led to Strzok\u2019s removal from the Mueller probe because they indicated an anti-Trump bias. After Trump was elected, Page sent a text to Strzok, saying: \u201cAre you even going to give out your calendars? Seems kind of depressing. Maybe it should just be the first meeting of the secret society.\u201d That spurred speculation among the president\u2019s allies about possible anti-Trump meetings, but eventually it was concluded to be a joke.", "lang": "en"}
