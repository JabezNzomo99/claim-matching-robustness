Bush.\n\nThe National Postal Museum keeps a digital copy of every pre-paid stamp ever issued by the USPS in an online database that contains stamps dating back to 1847. A search of its online collection turned up no record of the Trump postage stamp.\n\nHowever, the Facebook video does closely resemble footage from the USPS\u2019s dedication ceremony for a stamp honoring Bush on June 12. Officials unveiled the \u201cforever\u201d stamp at his presidential library and museum in College Station, Texas, with Bush family members and friends, former colleagues and the general public in attendance.\n\nSeven people stand around the stamp replica during the unveiling of the stamp, six of which are visible in the doctored video. They appear to be the exact same people in the exact same attire as those onstage for the removal of the curtain in footage of Bush\u2019s stamp reveal.\n\nEven more dubious, the fake stamp design has Cyrillic lettering and \u201cRussia 2017\u201d next to Trump\u2019s face. The president also appears to be wearing a Russian flag on his lapel in the portrait.\n\nThe issuance of a postage stamp commemorating Bush came nearly seven months after the 41st president\u2019s death on Nov. 30. The unveiling occurred on what would have been his 95th birthday.", "lang": "en"}
