However, the claim is false; the recording has been online since 2012 and used to report the conflict in Sudan.\n\nOn March 2, 2020, AFP reported on heavy fighting in a Somali border town -- Bulohawo, near the Kenyan town of Mandera -- between government forces and supporters of a fugitive minister hiding out in Kenya.\n\nDetails of the conflict remained sketchy for most of the day, although videos and photos purportedly showing events in the area circulated on social media.\n\nAmong them is footage of men firing shots from moving gun-mounted pickup trucks. The video was shared in multiple Facebook and Twitter posts, including some belonging to news outlets.\n\nOne post viewed more than 40,000 times appeared in a Facebook group of Kenyan news site Kenyan.co.ke with the caption \u201cFighting Ongoing at the Kenya-Somalia Border\u201d.\n\nThe clip was shared more than 600 times and attracted more than one thousand comments and reactions.\n\nThe same news site also shared the video on its Twitter handle (archived here) before deleting the post on both social media platforms.\n\nAnother post on a Somali Facebook Page with more than 40,000 followers shared the same video. The caption translates into English as: \"Fighting which has continued for more than 4 hours is ongoing in Bulohawo town and civilian neighbourhoods are under artillery fire.\"\n\nThe video on this post has been viewed more than 4,000 times.\n\nOn Twitter, this handle with more than 800,000 followers shared the same clip claiming it was recorded on the Kenya-Somalia border.\n\n\u201cFighting on the Kenya-Somalia border btw Somalia army and JUBALAND mercenaries (sic),\u201d the caption reads.\n\nThough some online users seemed to believe the video was of the ongoing attack at the Kenya-Somali border, others appeared to recognise the clip as old footage of the conflict in Sudan.\n\nOne comment on the misleading post led us to this video posted on Youtube on January 27, 2014, titled, \u201cNuba Warriors From South Sudan: In a major Fire Fight\u201d. The exact footage of gun-mounted pickups firing while on the move can be seen three minutes and 17 seconds into the video.\n\nAnother cue suggested that the video could be from the conflict between Sudan and South Sudan over the disputed Heglig oil fields in 2012.\n\nIn March 2012, as reported by AFP here, border fighting between Sudan and South Sudan broke out when Southern troops briefly wrested the valuable Heglig oil field from Khartoum's control and Sudan launched bombing raids in response.\n\nWe searched the keywords \u201cHeglig\u201d \u201cconflict\u201d and \u201cSouth Sudan\u201d on YouTube and came across this video published in 2012.\n\nTitled \u201cSouth Sudan Victory in Panthou Heglig front line. Long live SPLA\u201d, it contains the exact clip used in the misleading posts purporting to show the fighting on the Kenya-Somali border. This can be viewed three minutes and 23 seconds into the footage.\n\nSouth Sudan has been wracked by conflict since 2013 due to political rivalry among the ruling elite, and fighting devastated the oil sector -- its main earner.", "lang": "en"}
