The posts claim that rule breakers will be charged with distracted driving, face high fines and earn demerit points. This is false; the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), BC and Alberta governments told AFP that no changes to driving laws go into effect in February.\n\nFacebook posts shared by users in Canada show a photo of a notice titled: \u201cDistracted Driving Laws In Effect February 1, 2020.\u201d\n\nThe posts claim that a long list of activities including eating, drinking, smoking, vaping, grooming, adjusting the radio, listening to extremely loud music, or talking to passengers, will be considered distracted driving in BC and Alberta. \u201cThe Government has announced warnings are not to be given,\u201d it ads.\n\nThe notice urges readers to get more information on this RCMP website, which is just a page describing factors that can contribute to distracted or fatigued driving.\n\nThere will be no changes to driving laws in BC or Alberta on February 1, 2020.\n\nHope Latham, a spokeswoman for the BC Ministry of Public Safety, told AFP, \u201cThere are no changes planned to BC\u2019s distracted driving laws at this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Facebook post showing coming changes to distracted driving legislation on Feb 1, 2020 is 100 percent false,\u201d Mike Halskov, a BC RCMP Traffic Services officer told AFP in an email.\n\nHalskov explained that the posts play on the distinction between \u201cdistracted driving\u201d and \u201cdriving without due care and attention.\u201d\n\nIn BC, distracted driving is referred to as \u201cuse of electronic device while driving\u201d in the Motor Vehicles Act. This is illegal in all Canadian provinces, save under specific circumstances, such as using a hands-free device or talking to the police.\n\nDriving without due care and attention is an offense that encapsulates situations that do not involve the use of an electronic device. Those activities are not illegal, but they could be used as evidence of improper driving, which carries a minimum fine of Can$100.\n\nBC Driving Lawyers, an association specialized in traffic cases, points out that most tickets issued by the police will be around Can$368.\n\n\u201cI have never heard of a situation where a driver has been charged with driving without due care and attention for talking to a passenger,\u201d Halskov told AFP.\n\nCanLII, an open access database for Canadian legislation and legal cases, shows 6,542 results for legal cases involving driving without due care and attention. In cases reviewed by AFP, such as this one or this one, the accused were charged because their lack of attention or care led to an accident.\n\nNothing suggests any changes to Alberta\u2019s Traffic Safety Act will come into effect this February either.\n\n\u201cThese rumours around new rules and stricter penalties are false,\u201d Brooklyn Elhard, press secretary for the Alberta ministry of transportation told AFP in an email.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of any upcoming proposed legislation change to the distracted driving laws,\u201d Laurel Scott, a spokeswoman for the RCMP\u2019s Alberta division told AFP in an email.\n\nScott added that the fines for Alberta in the false post \u201care non-existent.\u201d\n\nUnder Alberta\u2019s current traffic laws, the penalty for distracted driving is a Can$287 fine and three demerit points, not Can$3,000 as the false posts claim.\n\nIn Alberta, reading and \u201cpersonal grooming\u201d are considered distracted driving, but the following activities are not specifically restricted by law.\n\nOn January 28, 2020, the Alberta government webpage for distracted driving was warning individuals not to believe reports of upcoming changes in legislation.\n\nAnother Facebook post that gained traction in Canada and Australia in late 2019 claimed that distracted driving would lead to a three year license suspension, starting January 2020. That claim was also false, as this article shows.", "lang": "en"}
