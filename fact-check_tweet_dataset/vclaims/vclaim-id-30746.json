What\u2019s pictured is more commonly known as a timing belt, a part that serves an important operational function in internal combustion engine-powered vehicles:\n\nThe timing belt is the belt that controls the camshafts in your engine, opening and closing valves at just the right time for smooth operation. The timing belt has teeth that turn the camshaft in time with the crankshaft. Some cars and trucks use timing chains or gears, which are more durable. But timing belts, made of rubber compound, are quieter and more efficient. They also don\u2019t need lube to work. On some engines, if the timing belt fails, valves will be held open when they should not be and will be struck by the pistons, causing major damage to your engine. So you want to prevent it at all costs.\n\nEven if you didn\u2019t quite understand this explanation of the timing belt\u2019s function, all you need to know is that if you cut it off your car, you likely wouldn\u2019t need to buy any gasoline at all \u2014 because your vehicle would no longer run.\n\nIn short, this meme was a joke aimed at the automotively non-literate crowd.\n\nIn that spirit of vehicular japing, enjoy the following tongue-in-cheek video demonstrating \u201cHow to Check Your Blinker Fluid\u201d:", "lang": "en"}
