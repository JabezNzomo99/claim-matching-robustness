(You can see our fact-checks from night one here.)\n\nJoe Biden, attacking Sen. Cory Booker\u2019s time as Newark mayor: \"The Justice Department came after you for saying you were engaging in behavior that was inappropriate, and then in fact nothing happened, the entire time you were mayor.\"\n\nThis attack doesn\u2019t tell the full story. When Booker became mayor in 2006, he inherited decades of a city with violent crime and a troubled police department.\n\nIn 2010, the ACLU of New Jersey asked the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate the police department, citing 400 allegations of police misconduct. Booker initially resisted the idea of a federal investigation, but later welcomed the probe.\n\nIn July 2014, the Justice Department released a long list of constitutional violations by the department and cited stop and arrest practices, use of force and theft by officers, among other serious problems. (By that time, Booker was a U.S. senator.)\n\n\"The City of Newark is diminished, and the NPD rendered less effective, by these patterns and practices of unconstitutional conduct,\" the Justice Department wrote.\n\nUdi Ofer, an ACLU official, tweeted in March that Booker helped usher in reforms before the Justice Department came out with its findings. Those reforms included stop-and-frisk tracking and reporting policies, a policy to restrict the police department\u2019s cooperation with immigration authorities, and the addition of a civilian review board.\n\nKamala Harris, U.S. senator from California: \"I'm going to go back to Vice President Biden because your plan does not cover everyone in America by your staff\u2019s and your own definition. Ten million people, as many as 10 million people, will not have access to health care.\"\n\nHer estimate needs further scrutiny. When Biden unveiled his health care plan a couple weeks ago, his campaign noted \u2014 under the bold heading, \"Give Every American Access to Affordable Health Insurance\" \u2014 that his plan would insure \"more than an estimated 97 percent of Americans.\"\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign initially seized on that figure, arguing that that would leave about 10 million people uninsured.\n\nA Harris campaign spokeswoman pointed to the fact that there are an estimated 329.3 million people in the United States, and 3 percent of the total population would be about 9.88 million people.\n\nImprecise math aside, there are other factors that could play into the number of uninsured individuals under a Biden health care system. That includes the fact that some Americans just don\u2019t want insurance \u2014 the problem the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate was intended to fix.\n\nKirsten Gillibrand, U. S. senator from New York, about Biden: \"When the Senate was debating middle class affordability for child care he wrote an op-ed. He voted against it, the only vote, but what he wrote (in) an op-ed was that he believed that women working outside the home would, \u2018Create the deterioration of family\u2019. He also said that women who were working outside the home were \u2018avoiding responsibility\u2019.\"\n\nGillibrand appeared to be referring to a statement by Biden in 1981 when he was the lone senator to vote against expanding a child care tax credit. That vote gained new life recently, after the Huffington Post published comments by Biden that were reported in the Indianapolis News on July 29, 1981. It included the following quote (bold type is ours):\n\n\"I think it is a sad commentary on this society when we say, as a matter of social policy, that we should make it easier for people who have neither the financial necessity nor the personal need to forget their responsibility to take care of a child all day from the time the child is an infant until the time he or she gets in school. I do not care whether in a modern marriage you want the man or the woman to take that responsibility. That has to be resolved by each couple individually.\"\n\nBiden\u2019s full op-ed had the headline \"Congress is subsidizing deterioration of family.\" (We don\u2019t know if he wrote that.) Within the op-ed, Biden wrote that \"a recent act of Congress puts the federal government in the position, through the tax codes, of subsidizing the deterioration of the family. That is tragic.\"\n\nThe op-ed does not single out women working outside the home. Biden\u2019s general point was that lower income families should not have to subsidize higher income families\u2019 day care expenses.\n\nBiden also made it clear he didn\u2019t have a problem with women working outside the home when he said he was proud of his wife\u2019s teaching career in a floor speech July 28, 1981. Biden said he was \"proud of the fact that she has such a career.\"\n\nBiden didn\u2019t oppose the concept of a child care tax credit, but opposed giving it to families making above $30,000. (In today\u2019s dollars that would equal about $84,500.)\n\nIn 1976, Biden voted along with the vast majority of senators for legislation which enacted a tax credit of 20 percent of the employment-related expenses arising for household and dependent care services.\n\nMike Bennet, U.S. senator from Colorado: \"I believe we should finish the job we started with the Affordable Care Act with a public option that gives everybody in this audience the chance to pick for their family whether they want private insurance or public insurance and requires drug companies to be negotiated with by Medicare and it provides competition. That is totally different from the plan that Sen. (Elizabeth) Warren and Sen. (Bernie) Sanders and Sen. Harris have proposed, which would make illegal employer-based health insurance in this country.\"\n\nBoth Bennet and Biden claimed Harris\u2019 plan would lead to the elimination of employer-based insurance. That could be the case, particularly for plans that would not meet the expansive requirements for coverage of \"medically necessary\" services Harris outlined.\n\nThere is more to learn about Harris\u2019 plan, released just two days ago \u2014 and at least a couple problems with Bennet\u2019s claim.\n\nTo start, while Warren, Sanders and Harris all use the term \"Medicare for All\" to refer to their preferred health care plan, they do not share a single plan.\n\nThe Sanders plan (endorsed by Warren) would eliminate private insurance in favor of a government plan. Harris\u2019 plan, though, keeps a role for private insurers willing to offer Medicare coverage that meet certain benefit and cost requirements.\n\nDuring her plan\u2019s decade-long phase-in, Harris wrote in a Medium post \u2014 and Bennet\u2019s campaign cited as evidence \u2014 that it would \"provide a commonsense path for employers, employees, the underinsured, and others on federally-designated programs, such as Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act exchanges, to transition.\"\n\nWould those employer plans transition out of existence? Harris\u2019 campaign did not immediately respond to inquiries about the future of employer-based insurance under her proposal.\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii on Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 time as a prosecutor: Harris \"put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana.\"\n\nThis claim about Harris putting \"over 1,500 people in jail\" for pot violations is cited in a February article by the Free Beacon, a conservative online news website. The article says \"at least 1,560 people were sent to state prisons for marijuana-related offenses between 2011 and 2016,\" when Harris was California attorney general. It says the data comes from reports from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.\n\nPolitiFact could not immediately access that data during the debate. But we do know that as attorney general, Harris would not have personally prosecuted marijuana cases. Those cases would have been handled by lower-level state attorneys.\n\nThe portion about Harris laughing about marijuana is supported.\n\nRunning for re-election in 2014 as state attorney general, Harris laughed at a TV reporter\u2019s question about her GOP opponent\u2019s support for legalizing marijuana, adding \"he\u2019s entitled to his opinion\" but not offering her own.\n\nIn a February interview on New York-based radio show \"The Breakfast Club,\" Harris said she had smoked marijuana in the past, \"I have. And I inhaled \u2060\u2014 I did inhale. It was a long time ago. But, yes.\" The senator then laughed, according to a CNN article, and said she tried pot in college and noted that it was in the form of a joint. \"I just broke news,\" she said.\n\nAs California attorney general in 2016, Harris declined to weigh in on a state ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana. Now as a U.S. senator and presidential candidate, Harris supports marijuana legalization.\n\nAndrew Yang, entrepreneur: \"Amazon is closing 30% of America's stores and malls and paying zero in taxes while doing it.\"\n\nThere\u2019s no question that online retailing \u2060\u2014 of which Amazon is the biggest U.S. player \u2060\u2014 has taken a bite out of brick-and-mortar store sales. But Yang\u2019s specific assertion needs more context.\n\nAccording to the consulting firm CoStar, retail stores shuttered a record number of square feet for one year by August 2018, even before the full 12-month period was complete. Meanwhile, e-commerce sales as a percentage of all sales has been growing for years. And the number of malls is predicted to fall by 25% or 30% within the next few years, a metric that Yang\u2019s campaign cited when we asked for evidence.\n\nThat said, overall brick-and-mortar retail sales haven\u2019t plummeted \u2060\u2014 they\u2019re actually holding their own:\n\nIndeed, some sectors (including automotive, appliances and hardware) remain relatively impervious to online sales, even as others (such as toys, entertainment and books) have deteriorated.\n\nAs for Amazon\u2019s tax burden, Yang oversimplified. The $11.2 billion company didn\u2019t pay any federal income taxes last year, according to the Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy, a liberal think tank. In fact, it received a $129 million rebate.\n\nBut while Amazon takes advantage of tax breaks and loopholes, it does pay other taxes, including sales taxes, property taxes, payroll taxes and unemployment insurance.\n\nMichael Bennet: \"88% of the people in our prisons dropped out of high school.\"\n\nThat\u2019s an overstatement \u2014 at least when compared to the results of the 2014 Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies Survey of Incarcerated Adults.\n\nThe survey involved a representative sample of 1,300 prisoners who answered questions about their educational attainment, demographics, and other matters. According to that survey, 30% of incarcerated adults had less than a high school diploma; 64% had a high school credential.\n\nWe found other, older data that\u2019s a bit closer to Bennet\u2019s claim. The National Dropout Prevention Center on its website says that 75% of America\u2019s state prison inmates are high school dropouts and that 59% of America\u2019s federal prison inmates did not complete high school. The center references a 2003 study, which appears to be one from the Justice Department, and based on survey estimates from the 1990s.\n\nBennet\u2019s campaign sent PolitiFact a link to a 2014 post on the Huffington Post, contributed by Matthew Lynch, identified as the editor of The Edvocate & The Tech Edvocate. That post is about the causes and costs of the high school dropout rate. It has a line that says \"over 80 percent of the incarcerated population is high school dropouts.\" But it does not name or link to its source of information.\n\nA 2014 post by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond also cites an 80% estimate, but also omits its source \u2014 \"nearly 80% of all prisoners are high school dropouts or recipients of the General Educational Development (GED) credential,\" the post said, adding that more than half of inmates who have a GED got it while incarcerated; and that about 41% of all inmates have no high school credential at all.\n\nKamala Harris: \"I went to a place in Florida called Homestead, and there is a private detention facility being paid for by your taxpayer dollars \u2014 a private detention facility \u2014 that currently houses 2,700 children.\"\n\nHarris overstated the number of migrant children who are at the Homestead, Fla., facility. As of July 22, there were approximately 990 children at Homestead, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The capacity of the site is 2,700.\n\nThe Miami Herald reported Homestead is no longer taking additional children. The Homestead temporary shelter for unaccompanied children reopened in 2018 amid the first new wave of unaccompanied children who arrived that March. It is operated by Caliburn International, a private, for-profit company and a contractor of the government.\n\nHarris said that when she visited the Homestead site in Miami in late June she saw children in single-file lines being walked into barracks. Other Democrats have criticized conditions at the shelter, including that the children get less time to make phone calls than do federal prisoners.", "lang": "en"}
