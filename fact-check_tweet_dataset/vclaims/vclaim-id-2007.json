Only 6.5 million paid a tax penalty rather than buy insurance. The rest obtained waivers, including those who were living abroad or in states that did not expand Medicaid.\n\u2022 Ryan said he didn\u2019t think anyone would be hurt by the GOP bill\u2019s reduction in Medicaid spending of more than $800 billion over a decade. But the CBO estimated that 14 million fewer Americans would have Medicaid coverage by 2026, compared with current law.\n\u2022 Ryan also claimed that \u201cmore and more doctors are refusing to even accept people with Medicaid.\u201d We found no data supporting that. Available federal statistics in recent years show the doctor participation rate has remained around 70 percent.\n\u2022 Ryan mischaracterized CBO\u2019s estimate that the GOP bill would reduce the insured by 24 million. He wrongly claimed the CBO is \u201cbasically saying\u201d that 24 million fewer Americans \u201cthrough their own free choice\u201d will decide not to buy insurance. While some fit that description, many others do not.\n\nThe CBO estimates that the Republican health care bill will decrease federal spending on Medicaid by $839 billion over 10 years, from 2017 through 2026. On CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Price challenged host Jake Tapper\u2019s characterization of the reduction in future spending as \u201ccuts\u201d to the program.\n\nPrice was correct when he told Tapper that the reduction is from the CBO\u2019s \u201cbaseline\u201d estimate for Medicaid \u2014 which is the amount that the federal government would spend on Medicaid, the program for low-income families and the disabled, under current law.\n\nHowever, Price went too far when he claimed that federal spending on Medicaid would increase \u201cevery single year\u201d under the GOP bill and the annual increases would be \u201cequal to the cost of medical care.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the bill does not increase Medicaid spending \u201cevery single year,\u201d and the program\u2019s costs will exceed the inflation rate for medical costs, forcing states to make cuts in Medicaid benefits, according to the CBO. (CBO estimated the original legislation would reduce Medicaid outlays by $880 billion, the figure both Tapper and Price use. But after amendments were added to the bill, CBO in late March put the reduction at $839 billion over 10 years.)\n\nLet\u2019s first look at Price\u2019s claim that Medicaid spending will increase \u201cevery single year\u201d under the GOP bill.\n\nThe Washington Post Fact Checker already did the math and found that Price is wrong. We came to the same conclusion. Our calculations are based on CBO\u2019s 2016 baseline estimate for Medicaid spending under current law and CBO\u2019s recent estimate for how much the GOP bill would reduce Medicaid spending relative to the baseline.\n\nAs illustrated in the chart below, federal spending on Medicaid would increase in the first three years under the GOP bill, even though the federal government would be spending less than it would under current law. However, federal spending would decrease in the year 2020, and it would not increase above the fiscal year 2019 level until FY2023.\n\nPrice also claimed that annual increases in Medicaid spending would be \u201cequal to the cost of medical care.\u201d That\u2019s misleading. The House bill would adjust annual Medicaid spending based on the consumer price index for medical costs, referred to in the CBO report as the CPI-M. But CBO says Medicaid costs would outstrip inflation, beginning in 2020.\n\nAs we\u2019ve explained before, the House bill would cap the amount of federal funding that states can receive per Medicaid enrollee, beginning in 2020. The cap would provide varying amounts for each category of enrollee, such as children, and the blind and disabled. Currently, the federal government guarantees matching funds to states for qualifying Medicaid expenses, regardless of cost.\n\n\u201cThe Secretary of Health and Human Services would then inflate the average per-enrollee costs for each state by the growth in the consumer price index for medical care services (CPI-M),\u201d CBO explains.\n\nHowever, \u201cMedicaid spending would grow on a per-enrollee basis at a faster rate than the CPI-M,\u201d the CBO says, resulting in states receiving less in federal funding for Medicaid.\n\nPrice is wrong when he says \u201cMedicaid spending under the proposal \u2026 goes up every single year.\u201d It would drop in 2020, and the reason for that decrease is the cap on federal reimbursement for Medicaid, beginning that year.\n\nThis should not be surprising. The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that the federal and state governments would have spent nearly $200 billion less for Medicaid if the GOP\u2019s proposed funding formula had been in place from 2001 to 2011.\n\n\u201cOur analysis estimates that if 2000 per enrollee spending for full-benefit beneficiaries each enrollment group were limited to growth in CPI-M for the 2001-2011 period, total Medicaid spending would have been $195 billion lower over the period on net across all groups (about 6.5% lower), and federal spending would have been $128 billion lower (about 7.0% lower) than actual total spending,\u201d the KFF report said.\n\nOn NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on May 7, Price said, \u201cThere are 20 million people right now in this country who have said to the federal government, said to the previous administration, \u2018Nonsense, I\u2019m not going to participate in your plan. I\u2019ll either pay a fine through the IRS or I\u2019ll get a waiver.\u201d\n\nHe was more emphatic the same day on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d where he said, \u201cWe have got 20 million folks out there across this land who have told the federal government, \u2018Phooey, nonsense. I\u2019m not going to participate in your program because it doesn\u2019t do what I need done.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThat makes it sound as if all of those people didn\u2019t want to participate, but we don\u2019t know that to be the case.\n\nA January 2017 letter from IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said that, in 2015, 6.5 million people paid a tax penalty for not having health insurance for some portion of the year. In addition, 12.7 million people claimed one or more of the available exemptions to avoid the tax penalty. That\u2019s a total of 19.2 million people, which is shy of the 20 million cited by Price.\n\nThose figures don\u2019t show that all of those people were protesting the health care law.\n\nThe most common exemption, the IRS letter said, was for having low income. It\u2019s the exemption that applies \u201cto the entire tax household for the full year if the household income or gross income of the taxpayer is less than the tax filing threshold.\u201d\n\nThe other most claimed exemptions, in order, were:\n\u2022 The code used primarily when an individual has income below a certain threshold and resides in a state that did not expand Medicaid (Code G)\n\u2022 The code used by U.S. citizens living abroad and certain noncitizens (Code C)\n\u2022 The code used when health care coverage available to an individual is considered unaffordable (Code A)\n\nSo some could have had health insurance if the governor of their state had adopted the Medicaid expansion for those earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Others may not have been living in the U.S. and didn\u2019t need to purchase health insurance. And then some may have wanted to purchase insurance, but still found it too costly.\n\nEven those who paid a tax penalty may not have gone without insurance for the whole year. That\u2019s because the penalty, or \u201cshared responsibility payment,\u201d is generally due for the months that individuals did not have qualifying health insurance. So it\u2019s possible that some had to pay a tax penalty even though they had purchased health insurance for some months, but not others.\n\nRyan said on ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week\u201d that he didn\u2019t think anyone would be hurt by the American Health Care Act\u2019s cuts to Medicaid funding. But the CBO has estimated that 14 million fewer Americans would have Medicaid coverage by 2026 under the legislation.\n\nRyan went on to say that Medicaid \u201cworks better\u201d when states are given more flexibility to run the program.\n\nThe speaker is entitled to his opinion that the bill\u2019s changes to Medicaid, which would cut more than $800 billion from Medicaid over 10 years compared with current law, would improve the program.\n\nBut CBO said that 14 million fewer people would have Medicaid coverage by 2026, compared with current law. That\u2019s due to two major changes that the Republican legislation would make to the program. It would phase out the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion, with enhanced federal funding, and it would cap Medicaid spending per-enrollee, starting in 2020.\n\nNo new enrollment under this ACA expansion can occur after Dec. 31, 2019, in states that currently have adopted the expansion. But if expansion-based enrollees have a gap in coverage of more than one month, they wouldn\u2019t be able to re-enroll, unless a state wanted to cover the additional cost itself.\n\nCBO \u201cprojects that fewer than one-third of those enrolled as of December 31, 2019, would have maintained continuous eligibility two years later.\u201d\n\nThe Republican bill would also affect some who would have gained Medicaid coverage in the future under current law, as more states expanded coverage. Under the bill, new states can\u2019t opt in to the expansion after March 1, 2017.\n\nSo, some who have gained expansion coverage, and others who would have gained it in the future, wouldn\u2019t have Medicaid under this legislation.\n\nWhether that \u201churts\u201d may depend on individual circumstances. But those with Medicaid coverage do better than the uninsured in terms of accessing and affording health care, studies show. A July 2015 Government Accountability Office report, for instance, said: \u201cMedicaid enrollees report access to care that is generally comparable to that of privately insured individuals and better than that of uninsured individuals, but may have greater health care needs and greater difficulty accessing specialty and dental care.\u201d\n\nThe GOP bill\u2019s cap on per-enrollee federal spending would also lead to \u201cless federal reimbursement\u201d under the program, CBO says. States would have to make some changes because of this, which could include restricting eligibility or eliminating some services, as we explained above.\n\nRyan says there has been a \u201cmicro-management\u201d of the program by the federal government. The GOP bill gives states some more flexibility. They can elect to receive block grants, rather than per-enrollee funding, and they can institute work requirements for some Medicaid recipients. But again, the bill reduces federal funding, which leads to millions who otherwise would have Medicaid coverage not getting it.\n\nRyan also claimed that \u201cmore and more doctors are refusing to even accept people with Medicaid,\u201d but we found no evidence of that.\n\nWe looked at this issue in-depth in late March. The Medicaid physician participation rate, which is the percentage of doctors who say they accept new Medicaid patients, was 68.9 percent in 2013, according to the most recent figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics. That\u2019s lower than the participation rates of Medicare (83.7 percent) and private insurance (84.7 percent).\n\nThe Medicaid participation figures vary by state and are largely tied to reimbursement rates.\n\nThere is no continuous year-to-year measure on Medicaid doctor participation rates, but federal statistics gathered over recent years show the figure has remained around 70 percent.\n\nAlso, earlier this year, Ryan\u2019s office had referred us to figures from Merritt Hawkins, a consulting firm on physician staffing, but more recent results from those studies show no drop in participation rates. The firm called about 1,400 physician offices in five specialties in 15 markets, asking to make a new patient appointment and if the doctor accepted Medicaid. The results: 53 percent said they accepted new Medicaid patients in 2017, 45.7 percent in 2014, 55.4 percent in 2009 and 49.9 percent in 2004.\n\nA broader study by Merritt Hawkins and the Physicians Foundation surveyed 17,236 physicians and found 63.7 percent accepted all Medicaid patients and another 20.3 percent accepted limited numbers of Medicaid patients in 2016. The survey results for 2014 were similar.\n\nIn his \u201cThis Week\u201d interview, Ryan mischaracterized the CBO\u2019s estimate that the AHCA would result in 24 million fewer people being insured, claiming it was due to people \u201cthrough their own free choice\u201d deciding \u201cif they\u2019re not mandated to buy something that\u2019s unaffordable, they\u2019re not going to do it.\u201d While the CBO\u2019s figure does include some who fit that description, there are many others who do not.\n\nRyan\u2019s statement is the flip side of misleading claims by some Democrats who cited the CBO report as evidence that 24 million would have insurance ripped away from them. As we have reported, the 24 million figure includes some who will simply decide \u2014 once the individual mandate is lifted \u2014 to not have insurance.\n\nBut Ryan\u2019s claim swings too far in the other direction. In addition to those who will voluntarily forgo insurance if the mandate penalty is eliminated, the CBO analysis also includes millions of Americans who would not have health insurance because they were no longer eligible for the Medicaid expansion, they could no longer afford to buy insurance on the individual market, or their employer would no longer offer insurance to them.\n\nHere\u2019s some breakdown of the CBO\u2019s 24 million figure:\n\nIn 2018, \u201c14 million more people would be uninsured under the legislation than under current law,\u201d most \u2014 but not all \u2014 of that due to the American Health Care Act\u2019s immediate elimination of the individual mandate to have insurance or pay a tax, CBO said. CBO doesn\u2019t give specific numbers, but says that \u201c[s]ome of those people would choose not to have insurance because they chose to be covered by insurance under current law only to avoid paying the penalties, and some people would forgo insurance in response to higher premiums.\u201d\n\nSo at least some would be priced out of the insurance market due to higher premiums. CBO estimates premiums in the individual, or nongroup, market would go up in 2018 and 2019, due to healthy people leaving that market since they are not required to have insurance. In subsequent years, average premiums would be 10 percent lower than under current law, CBO said, but older and low-income Americans on the nongroup market could see substantially higher costs under the GOP plan, as insurers would be allowed to charge older people more and new, age-based tax credits wouldn\u2019t be large enough to offset those premium increases. By 2026, CBO estimates that 2 million fewer would have nongroup insurance under the Republican bill.\n\nAs we\u2019ve explained, CBO also estimated a significant reduction in Medicaid enrollment. By 2026, there would be 14 million fewer people on Medicaid compared with current law. \u201c[S]ome states would discontinue their expansion of eligibility, some states that would have expanded eligibility in the future would choose not to do so, and per-enrollee spending in the program would be capped,\u201d CBO said.\n\nIt would be a stretch to describe those who no longer qualified for Medicaid as deciding to not have insurance \u201cthrough their own free choice,\u201d as Ryan put it.\n\nAnd CBO estimates 7 million fewer people would have employer-sponsored insurance by 2026, some due to their own decision not to have it and some due to employers no longer offering insurance.", "lang": "en"}
