It is not legal in any U.S. state.\n\nBut, an incendiary headline has been circulating on Facebook claiming: \u201cMaine House Democrats Vote to Allow Female Genital Mutilation.\u201d\n\nFacebook users flagged it as potentially false. It is.\n\nThe underlying story is based on a recent vote in the Maine legislature, which was considering a bill that would have criminalized the practice under state law in addition to the existing federal law.\n\nThe Senate and the House of Representatives in Maine failed to agree on the text of the bill, and the measure died at the end of the session on April 18. The failure of the bill, however, doesn\u2019t mean that Maine will now \u201callow female genital mutilation,\u201d as the headline claimed.\n\nDebate over the bill had been highly charged for months. The Southern Poverty Law Center published emails in February between one Republican representative and a group called ACT for America, which the SPLC has designated as hate group.\n\nACT for America has \u201chelped pass\u201d female genital mutilation legislation in nine states, according to the group\u2019s website. It has also \u201chelped pass\u201d legislation that bans Sharia Law and legislation that \u201cprotect those who \u2018see something\u2019 and \u2018say something,'\u201d according to its website.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union also had weighed in on an early version of the bill in Maine, saying in a statement, \u201cThis bill is nothing more than an attempt to single out behavior that is commonly attributed to certain religious and ethnic communities as different from other forms of abuse.\u201d The ACLU called the bill \u201credundant,\u201d because \u201cthere are already severe penalties under both Maine and federal law that cover FGM.\u201d\n\nAccording to a women\u2019s advocacy group called Equality Now, there were 26 states as of September 2017 that had enacted legislation criminalizing female genital mutilation in addition to the federal ban. Those laws differ in a number of ways, including the age-range they cover and the allowance for culture as defense.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\n128th Maine Legislature.
