One could mark the beginning of the conflict from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990, or date from start of combat operations on Jan. 17, 1991. The invasion ended Feb. 28, 1991, after just 100 hours of ground combat.\n\nThe United States and allies invaded and occupied Iraq in 2003, 16 years ago. O\u2019Rourke might have more properly started his narrative here. Congress in October 2002 passed a resolution authorizing an attack on Iraq to force it to give up its stash of weapons of mass destruction \u2014 weapons that turned out not to exist. So, this war was waged for different reasons than the Gulf War.\n\nEvans said O\u2019Rourke\u2019s remarks were inspired by Gen. Stephen W. Wilson, the Air Force\u2019s vice chief of staff, who came before the House Armed Services Committee on Oct. 3, 2017, and stated: \u201cThe 26 years of continuous combat has limited our ability to prepare . . . against advanced future threats. Scenarios with the lowest margin of error and the highest risk to national security. This nonstop combat, paired with the budget instability and lower than planned top lines, has been the United States Air Force, the smallest, oldest equipment and least ready in our history.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe 1991 Gulf War was a distinct event with a beginning and an end. It was authorized by the U.N. Security Council with the mission of expelling Iraqi security forces from Kuwait, and it ended when that mission was accomplished,\u201d he said. \u201cIn December 1998, the Clinton administration bombed Iraq for four days in Operation Desert Fox. The goal of that operation was to set back Saddam\u2019s missile and nuclear programs. It seems a stretch to argue that it was part of the same war as the expulsion of Iraq from Kuwait in 1991.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. government has employed a number of diplomatic and military tools in the service of different goals and different strategies in Iraq since at least 1980. From arms sales to arms embargoes, engagement and isolation, the deployment and withdrawal of troops and trainers, we\u2019ve tried it all at some point. None of it has worked, assuming \u2018worked\u2019 means we don\u2019t have to pay attention to Iraq any more,\u201d said Jon B. Alterman, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\u201cWhere his critique reads true to me is that we\u2019ve embraced quick and decisive military action without thinking through how we want things to be and what it will cost to get them there (if we even can get them there), and that\u2019s put us in the hole for future costs \u2014 military and economic \u2014 that we hadn\u2019t ever considered.\"", "lang": "en"}
