It is noteworthy that the coronavirus pandemic has led governments across the world to impose a restriction on citizens\u2019 movement. In the video, one can spot a red logo on the top right corner. \n\n\n\nSeveral Twitter and Facebook users have posted the video with the English text, \u201cThis is lockdown in Spain You guys in India are lucky\u2026u just get caned..\u201d The viral video has also been shared along with a Hindi text, \u201cIf you feel the lockdown in India is harsh just have a look at this American lockdown (translated from \u0905\u0917\u0930 \u0906\u092a\u0915\u094b INDIA \u0915\u093e lockdown \u095b\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093e \u0915\u095c\u0915 \u0932\u0917\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0924\u094b \u090f\u0915 \u092c\u093e\u0930 American Lockdown \u092d\u0940 \u0926\u0947\u0916\u0932\u0947)\u201d.\n\nAlt News also received several requests to fact-check the viral video on WhatsApp (+91 76000 11160) and on our official Android application.\n\nAlt News used InVid, a video verification tool, to identify the red-coloured logo. InVid breaks any video into multiple frames and recognises if the video carries a logo. As it turns out, the logo is of Meydan TV, a Berlin-based Azerbaijani non-profit media organisation.\n\nWe rummaged the YouTube channel of Meydan TV and found the viral video. It was published on October 21, 2019. The first coronavirus case was reported in China in November 2019.\n\nThe video represents the 2019 protest in Azerbaijan\u2019s Baku. According to the description, the video shows an October 19 rally following which authorities and New Azerbaijan Party officials claimed that police did not use violence, however, visual evidence showed otherwise.\n\nAccording to an October 19 Reuters report, \u201cPolice in Azerbaijan on Saturday detained scores of protesters, including the leader of the main opposition Popular Front, at the start of a planned rally against low salaries, corruption and a lack of democracy in the energy-rich ex-Soviet state. The protesters have a wide range of demands, including higher salaries for state employees and fair and independent elections in a country long accused by human rights groups and Western governments of a lack of transparency.\u201d\n\nA report by Human Rights Watch stated, \u201cAccording to the police, they detained 60 of the approximately 220 people who participated in the unsanctioned demonstration on October 19, releasing 42 with a warning, and sending 18 cases to administrative courts. The authorities also detained at least 10 senior opposition party members ahead of the October 19 rally. Among them was a prominent opposition journalist, Seymur Hazi, who was detained on October 17 and sentenced the same day to 15 days of administrative detention.\u201d\n\nEuropean Union External Action and US Embassy in Azerbaijan released a statement condemning the violence used by police on peaceful protestors during the rally.\n\nThus, the video does not depict police excess during coronavirus lockdown in Spain or the US.", "lang": "en"}
