The claim is false; the video is from a 2015 television news report about the Kanlaon volcano; the Philippine seismology agency said volcanic activities at Kanlaon in January 2020 were within normal levels.\n\nThe video was shared here on Twitter on January 15, 2020, just days after the Taal volcano erupted.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s English and Tagalog caption reads: \u201cAfter the taal volcano, it\u2019s now mt. kanloon, the earth is not healthy anymore\u201d.\n\nTaal volcano, which is just south of Manila, erupted on January 12, blanketing the surrounding areas with ash. Scientists warned that the volcano was still at risk of a major blast, AFP reported here on January 21.\n\nThe video was shared with a similar claim in multiple other Twitter posts; for example here, here and here.\n\nA similar claim was also shared in Facebook posts here and here without the video.\n\nThe claim is false; the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) said that Kanlaon, which is located in the central Philippines\u2019 Negros island, remained at alert level 0.\n\n\u201cCurrently, Kanlaon is on alert level 0, which means normal level,\u201d Mari-Andylene Quintia, a PHIVOLCS resident volcanologist at Kanlaon, told AFP by phone on January 23.\n\nThe video in the misleading post is \u201cnot the current activity of Kanlaon,\u201d she added.\n\nThe footage has been shared in a misleading context as the video links to a news segment on YouTube that aired on December 11, 2015 on GMA News, a Philippine television network.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the GMA News video report with the date circled:\n\nThe video\u2019s Tagalog-language title states the report aired in the show SONA and translates to English as: \u201cMt. Kanlaon in Negros Island spewed ash 2 times today\u201d.\n\nAs GMA reported, the PHIVOLCS did issue an alert for Kanlaon on December 11, 2015, which warned that the volcano remains on alert level 1 and was \u201cat an abnormal condition and is in a current period of unrest\u201d.\n\nThe seismology agency later lowered Kanlaon to alert level 0 on October 25, 2019, saying \u201cobservational parameters have returned to baseline levels and no magmatic eruption is foreseen in the immediate future.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the October 2019 alert:", "lang": "en"}
