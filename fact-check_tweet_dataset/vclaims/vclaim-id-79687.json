Meanwhile, some Facebook users have fabricated a more positive storyline about the president and the storm.\n\nOne post, published Sept. 8, claims that Trump has donated $1 million to \"the relief fund\" for the Bahamas, which have been devastated by Dorian.\n\nThe image, which shows small vignettes of Trump and what appears to be hurricane damage on a blue background, was posted in a group dedicated to the QAnon conspiracy theory.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) And it has been shared several hundred times in several different formats, so we wanted to check it out.\n\nWe reached out to the Facebook user who shared the post to see where they got it, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\n\nWe could find no evidence that Trump personally donated $1 million to Bahamas relief efforts. News outlets have not covered such a move, and the White House itself hasn\u2019t released any statements about Dorian-related donations. If the president had, it\u2019s reasonable to assume the move would have received some attention.\n\nWe reached out to the White House to confirm, but we haven\u2019t heard back. However, million-dollar donations to hurricane relief funds aren\u2019t entirely outside the realm of possibility.\n\nSeveral high-profile companies and celebrities, including Disney and Michael Jordan, have pledged $1 million to Dorian victims. So have cruise brands like Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line. And, following Hurricane Harvey in 2017, Trump did donate $1 million of his own money to charities helping with recovery efforts in Houston \u2014 a move that was announced by the White House at the time.\n\nBut there\u2019s no evidence that Trump has made a similar commitment for the Bahamas. We rate the Facebook post False.", "lang": "en"}
