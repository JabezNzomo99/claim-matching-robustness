But they mislead in doing so.\n\n\u201cFlint Michigan needs $167 million to fix their [sic] water problem,\u201d read the posts, which include a picture of a brown liquid pouring from a faucet. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t this a national emergency?\u201d\n\nThe $167 million figure is actually the total amount of state and federal funds assigned to upgrading and fixing Flint\u2019s water infrastructure, as outlined in a December 2018 memo sent by Michigan\u2019s Department of Environmental Quality.\n\nIn other words, that money already has been approved for the project \u2014 and work replacing lead and galvanized steel pipes throughout the city is underway (albeit not without criticism over the methods and efficiency of the effort). As of January, according to the city, \u201cservice lines to 7,966 homes have been identified as lead and/or galvanized and have been replaced, including 1,738 homes found this year.\u201d\n\nFormer President Barack Obama, in January 2016, did approve an emergency declaration in Michigan, a move that authorized federal aid for the response to the water crisis. The Environmental Protection Agency also issued an emergency administrative order under the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n\nLater that year, Obama also signed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation (WIIN) Act, which, among other things, provided $170 million for communities grappling with drinking water emergencies. Flint was specifically mentioned as an intended recipient.\n\nSeveral months later, in March 2017, the EPA, then under the Trump administration, announced that it was awarding $100 million of WIIN funding to Flint in order to help fund water infrastructure replacements and upgrades. That\u2019s included in the $167 million total.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\n\u201cEmergency Administrative Order.\u201d Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 21 Jan 2016.\n\n\u201cEPA Awards $100 Million to Michigan for Flint Water Infrastructure Upgrades.\u201d Press release, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 17 Mar 2017.\n\nEpkey, Amy.
