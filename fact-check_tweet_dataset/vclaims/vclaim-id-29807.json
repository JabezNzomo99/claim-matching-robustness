Fortunately it never happened, the entire thing is not true.\n\nThe story originated on satirical website World News Daily Report where it was first published under the title \"Man with Alzheimer's disease dies after getting 14 flu shots in a day\" on February 15th 2018 (archived here). It opened:\n\nAn 81-year old man suffering from Alzheimer's disease was found dead in his home Yesterday, after getting more than dozen influenza vaccines over an 8 hour period.\n\nEdward Norris, from Newark in New Jersey, was found dead in his bed Yesterday morning by his visiting daughter. The elderly man was known to suffer from Alzheimer's disease but was otherwise rather healthy, so his sudden demise came as a surprise to his family. While inspecting his bedroom, his daughter Philis noticed a pile of receipts from various hospitals medical clinics on a bed table. According to her, the papers indicated that the elderly man had received at least 21 flu shots over a two day period, 14 of them on the same day.\n\nThe image that accompanied the story was just a stock photo taken from Shutterstock where it was titled \"Smiling senior man\".\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known hoax website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories.

All characters appearing in the articles in this website - even those based on real people - are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.\n\nIt is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run the satirical Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a satirical site spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al. Articles from the site frequently get lifted by other sites that omit the satire disclaimer. We suspect this one might soon get lifted by sites using it as \"evidence\" that flu shots are unsafe. If you saw the story on such a site, rest assured it was actually just a piece of satire.", "lang": "en"}
