The claim is false; the image has been doctored to include the image of the Indian Muslim reformer.\n\nThis photo was published here on Facebook on October 18, 2019. It has been shared more than 200 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post\u2019s caption reads: \u201cA tribute to social reformer Sir Syed Ahmad Khan by the UAE Government. This depicts the power of the vision.\u201d\n\n\u201cSir Syed Ahmad Khan\u201d was an Indian Muslim reformer who was born on October 17, 1817, and died in 1885. He founded Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College in 1877 in Aligarh, in northern India. The college became Aligarh Muslim University in 1920.\n\nThe image purports to show Sir Syed's image projected onto the Burj Khalifa, the world\u2019s tallest building in Dubai, UAE.\n\nThe image was also published here and here on Facebook with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the photo of the Burj Khalifa has been manipulated, superimposing the portrait of Sir Syed onto the image of the skyscraper.\n\nA reverse image search on Yandex found this photo published on Facebook page Globo Treks on January 30, 2012.\n\nThe same photograph was also published on the Globotreks.com blog site here.\n\nAFP has marked the identical key features in the misleading photo and Globo Treks\u2019 photo with red rectangles.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the misleading photo (L) and Globo Treks\u2019 photo (R):\n\nNorbert Figueroa, the owner of the Globo Treks Facebook and blog site, told AFP he took the photo.\n\n\u201cI clicked that photograph in January 2012, though I don\u2019t remember the exact date,\u201d he wrote in an email on October 25, 2019.\n\nThe portrait of Sir Syed was published here on the website for Aligarh Muslim University.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of his portrait on the university's website:\n\nThe university's green logo, which was superimposed on the bottom of the Burj Khalifa, can be seen here.\n\nThe skyscraper frequently puts on light shows to honor world leaders and famous figures in the evening. On October 2, 2019, it lit up with Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s picture to honor his 150th anniversary, its official Twitter account shows here.\n\nThe Twitter account did not post anything on October 17, 2019. This search for Sir Syed on the Burj Khalifa's official Twitter account retrieved no results.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the search:", "lang": "en"}
