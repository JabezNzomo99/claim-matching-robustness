At the same point in Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, Obama\u2019s approval rating per Rasmussen was 48 percent and 49 percent. But Trump inaccurately described his poll number as \u201cmuch higher than President Obama at the same point.\u201d\n\nThe margin of error for the latest Rasmussen daily tracking poll is plus or minus 2.5 percent, which means Trump\u2019s approval rating could fall somewhere between 47.5 percent and 52.5 percent.\n\nTrump tweeted on April 15 that he had \u201cjust hit 50% in the Rasmussen Poll.\u201d\n\nTrump actually has hit 50 percent, and higher, several times in the Rasmussen poll. Trump started with 56 percent of likely voters approving of his performance according to Rasmussen on Jan. 20, 2017, when he was inaugurated, and hit a high point of 59 percent six days later.\n\nObama started his time in office on Jan. 20, 2009, with a 67 percent approval according to Rasmussen.\n\nHere\u2019s how the two presidents\u2019 approval numbers compare, according to just this one poll.\n\nThe latest Rasmussen figures show Trump at 49 percent on April 17 and Obama at 45 percent at the same point in his presidency.\n\nTrump frequently cites Rasmussen, which Newsweek has called the president\u2019s \u201cfavorite poll.\u201d But Trump is cherry-picking.\n\nAmong 88 polls released this year, Rasmussen has the highest approval rating for Trump, according to Real Clear Politics. Three other recent polls have Trump\u2019s latest approval as low as 39 percent: Gallup, NBC News/Wall Street Journal and Reuters/Ipsos. All three polls were taken this month.\n\nIf we look at Real Clear Politics\u2019 average of polling data, Trump\u2019s latest approval rating is 42.1 percent, a bit below the average of 44.3 percent on Jan. 27, 2017, a week after he took the oath of office.\n\nObama, meanwhile, had an average approval of 63.3 percent on Jan. 27, 2009, and an average of 47.7 percent on April 17, 2010, according to RCP.\n\nFiveThirtyEight provides a weighted average of presidential approval polls and compares Trump\u2019s figures with those of past presidents, going back to Harry S. Truman.", "lang": "en"}
