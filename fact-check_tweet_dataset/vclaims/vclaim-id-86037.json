Given the complexity of this issue, we are going to fact check both the key phrase in the ad and Brown\u2019s claim that the goal of the bill was promoting adoptions.\n\nBrown backed this bill in 2003 while a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives and then in 2005 as a member of the state Senate. Neither bill progressed very far in Massachusetts, though such \u201cWomen\u2019s Right to Know\u201d laws have been enacted in 22 other states, according to the National Right to Life Committee.\n\nSuch laws emerged in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Planned Parenthood vs. Casey (1992), which preserved the right to abortion but also allowed states to require 24-hour waiting periods and informed consent requirements, among other restrictions. (In 1981, a U.S. Court of Appeals had nullified such requirements in Massachusetts, and the bill backed by Brown said in its preamble that it was intended to restore the requirements in the wake of the Casey decision.)\n\nTypically these laws require the production of pamphlets, replete with photos of a fetus at biweekly stages of development, as well as the signing of a form indicating the woman has received the material. Here\u2019s an example of the Arizona literature, the Louisiana brochure, and the Kansas informed consent form. Often the laws also require a 24-hour period between receiving the material and the abortion, giving a woman time to reflect on her decision.\n\u2022 None The referring physician, the physician performing the abortion, or either physician\u2019s agent must provide in a manner enabling the pregnant woman to receive at least twenty-four hours before the time an abortion is scheduled to be performed a printed pamphlet, the internet address to a state-sponsored website, or toll free number for an audio recording, all of which are created and maintained by the commissioner of public health.\n\u2022 None [The pamphlet etc. must include] a description of the probable anatomical and physiological characteristics of the unborn child at two week gestational increments from fertilization to full term, including color photographs or if a representative photograph is not available, realistic drawings of the developing unborn child at two week increments, and including written information about brain and heart function and the presence of external members and internal organs at each stage of development.\n\u2022 None Prior to the scheduled abortion and before the woman provides her written consent to the abortion, the referring physician or the physician performing the abortion must orally inform the woman of [the information in the pamphlet]\n\u2022 None [The doctor] shall orally inform the woman that alternatives to abortion are available, ask the woman if she has seen the information, including the list of abortion alternative agencies, provided in the pamphlet, website or recorded telephone message described in this section, give the woman a copy of the pamphlet if she requests one at this time, and provide the woman with an opportunity to contact abortion alternative agencies at this time should she so desire.\n\u2022 None If she decides to obtain the abortion, the woman shall sign a consent form. The form shall indicate that she has been offered the information described in this section and does provide her informed consent to the abortion. . The physician performing the abortion shall maintain the signed consent form in the physician\u2019s files and destroy it seven years after the date upon which the abortion is performed.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of verbiage but in essence, the woman is given the material with pictures 24 hours before an abortion. Then the doctor goes over the material again, asking whether she has seen it. Then the woman must sign the consent form, acknowledging that she has been offered the material.\n\nBrown is staking his objection to \u201cforce\u201d on the grounds that the law never said the woman had to read the material, only that she had to acknowledge receiving it. But how practical is that in the real world? A woman is given a brochure 24 hours before the procedure. Then she hears it all again from the doctor, who asks whether she has seen the information. She technically is not required to answer \u201cyes,\u201d but how many women in this situation are going to answer: \u201cNot your business, doctor. I have a right to remain silent.\u201d\n\nThis brings us to Brown\u2019s claim that this was only an \u201cadoption\u201d bill. There\u2019s very little in the contemporaneous news reporting that describes it as an adoption bill; instead, both advocates and opponents highlighted the fact that the pamphlet would outline the supposed physical, psychological, and emotional problems associated with abortion\u2014and that it would include graphic photographs. The point of the bill was the pamphlet, as highlighted in Shaneen\u2019s ad.\n\nOn highly technical grounds, we are giving the ad a single Pinocchio, which means that it is mostly correct. The word \u201cforce\u201d is going a step too far, given that technically the proposed law did not require a woman to confirm that she read the material. As a practical matter, the way the law is structured most women would probably believe that they are required to read the material and look at the photographs. News reporting at the time used the word \u201crequire,\u201d and that would have been a better word for the ad.", "lang": "en"}
