The claim is false; the video has previously circulated in news reports about an incident in Sri Lanka; multiple elements in the footage -- including the soldier's uniform and the transparent bags carried by the children -- show it was filmed in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe video, which is one minute 17 seconds long, was published in this Facebook post on June 5, 2019, where it has been viewed more than 300 times.\n\nIt shows young girls and boys in school uniforms greeting and touching the feet of a soldier.\n\nTouching an elder\u2019s feet is a gesture of respect observed in some South Asian countries.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe caption states: \u201c#NewIndia. School children touching feet of an army personal, this is so so good to see.\u201d\n\n\u201c#NewIndia\u201d refers to a campaign by the government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nThe same video was published with an identical claim in this post on Twitter, where it has been viewed more than 16,000 times.\n\nThe same video was viewed hundreds of times after being shared on Facebook here, here and here with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the video has previously circulated in news reports about an incident in Sri Lanka.\n\nThrough a combination of reverse image searches and keyword searches, AFP found a longer version of the video published on a Sri Lankan Facebook page here on May 30, 2019.\n\nThe Sinhala caption translates to English as: \"Wonderful work dear children. You all are disciplined children of decent parents. Your future is clear. You will never go wrong in the future. Our salutes to the brave war heroes who are protecting your motherland and you. We are in debt to you. Our heartfelt thanks to the videographer of this scene so we could explain this to the people of this country. We feel bad for those who care for this country\u2026\"\n\nThe video in the misleading posts corresponds with the video published by the Sri Lankan Facebook page from the 24 second mark until the end.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading posts (L) and the video on the Sri Lankan Facebook page (R):\n\nAnother reverse image search found this video published on May 30, 2019 by the official Facebook page of Sri Lankan television channel Hiru news.\n\nThe video\u2019s Sinhala caption translates to English as; \u201cExpressing gratitude to war heroes\u201d.\n\nHiru news shared a shorter version of the same clip on its verified YouTube channel here on May 31, 2019.\n\nThe video\u2019s Sinhala narration translates to English as: \u201cSecurity forces took steps to strengthen security in schools following security concerns that arose in the public mind following the Easter bombings. In a voluntary reaction to the way security personnel lined up to cast away any feelings of fear in young minds, seen here are the salutes of some school children, captured through a mobile phone camera\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Easter bombings\u201d refers to attacks on churches and hotels in Colombo on April 21, which left at least 257 people dead. Here is an AFP story about the attacks.\n\nThe video contains multiple identifying features which help verify it was filmed in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe video shows some of the school children carrying transparent bags.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of children carrying the transparent bags, which are circled in yellow:\n\nSchool administrations asked students to bring their belongings in transparent bags, as a security measure when schools re-opened on May 6, 2019, two weeks after the Easter Sunday bombings.\n\nThis report published by The Guardian on May 12, 2019, states: \u201cStudents at state-run schools resumed classes last week. Campuses were guarded by police, and parents asked to replace school bags with clear plastic sacks. Attendance remains low.\u201d\n\nThe style of the soldier\u2019s fatigues in the video in the misleading posts also corresponds with recent photos of Sri Lanka soldiers in uniform, for example this AFP image taken May 15, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the image:\n\nThe video in the misleading posts also shows a green auto-rickshaw, or tuk tuk, displaying a Buddhist flag at the 19 second mark.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the video at this point, with the Buddhist flag circled in yellow:\n\nThe style of the green tuk tuk corresponds with other photos of green tuk tuks in Sri Lanka, including this one on AFP Forum taken in August 2017.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, Buddhist flags are usually displayed around Poya days, the Buddhist celebration of the full moon. The most significant such day for Buddhists, known as Wesak, was observed on May 18 this year.\n\nThe video appeared in Sri Lankan media reports in late May 2019.", "lang": "en"}
