Only the ghost of Strom Thurmond knows for sure.\n\nMystery surrounds whether, back in 1984, the former senator from South Carolina knowingly deprived Puerto Rico of bankruptcy protections that every U.S. state enjoys.\n\nIt\u2019s crunch time for Puerto Rico. The island territory needs to pay bondholders $422 million on May 1. It doesn\u2019t have the cash, it can\u2019t use bankruptcy to reschedule its payments, and Congress seems unlikely to craft a solution in time to avoid a massive default.\n\nDuring his HBO show Last Week Tonight, comedian and social critic John Oliver described the devil\u2019s brew of legal oddities and fiscal recklessness by Puerto Rican officials that brought the island territory of the United States to the financial brink.\n\n\"If you are massively in debt and you can\u2019t declare bankruptcy, you are stuck,\" Oliver said. \"And this happened because of a tiny amendment to a law in 1984, and the crazy thing is, no one can say why it was written.\"\n\nThe tiny amendment Oliver mentioned was stuck in the most boring location one could ever imagine \u2014 in the definitions section of , a bill geared mainly to fixing the bankruptcy court system. Buried in a long list of changes was the meaning of \"state.\"\n\n\" 'State' includes the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, except for the purpose of defining who may be a debtor under chapter 9 of this title;\"\n\nThat was it. With those two dozen words, the bankruptcy protections that applied to every state, and until 1984, to Puerto Rico, too, were wiped away.\n\n\"We tried to find out for ourselves why that amendment got attached,\" Oliver said. \"We knew Strom Thurmond had proposed it. So we asked an archivist at the library where his papers are kept to go through the relevant papers, and they came up with nothing.\"\n\nOliver quipped about that lack of a paper trail, saying it might be the best scenario for Thurmond given his reputation for \"fervent racism.\"\n\nOliver enlivened his diatribe over Puerto Rico's dilemma with a rap performed by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the son of Puerto Rican parents and the creator and star of the Broadway hit Hamilton. Miranda mentioned Thurmond, too:\n\nSomewhere down the line\n\nWhich brings us to the focus of this fact-check: Did Thurmond propose the cunning words that ultimately caught Puerto Rico in a debtor\u2019s vice?\n\nIn , the judges of the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals provided some very helpful background.\n\nIn March 1984, the House passed its version of a bankruptcy bill. That version did not have the Puerto Rico exemption.\n\nThen on May 21, 1984, the judges wrote that Thurmond introduced the package of changes that included the text at the center of this controversy.\n\n\"On the day that he introduced the amendment, Senator Thurmond addressed the Senate to explain several of its numerous stipulations, yet said little about the newly added Puerto Rico exemption,\" the judges wrote.\n\nIn fact, we went through the for that day (thank you, Internet Archive). Thurmond said less than little. He said nothing.\n\nThe record shows that after Thurmond\u2019s amendment, the exemption became part of the final legislation.\n\nWhile this seems to point the finger at Thurmond, there\u2019s more to this story. Aside from introducing the overall amendment, Thurmond might not have had much to do with the text. It had been introduced four years before, and not in the Senate, but in the House.\n\nExperts question whether Thurmond actually understood the significance of the amendment. To see why, we have to go back to 1978.\n\nThat year, Congress gave the bankruptcy law a complete overhaul. As often happens with major legislation, various gaps and ambiguities emerged and, in 1979, the Senate passed a bill to tidy up the loose ends. Among the dross, the Senate defined states to include Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and any territory or possession of the United States.\n\nThat legislation moved over to the House, and here the trail becomes murky. Bankruptcy law professor Stephen Lubben at Seton Hall University traced the twists and turns in a 2014 article.\n\n\"In July 1980, the House Judiciary Committee returned with an \u2018amendment\u2019 to the Senate bill that struck the entire Senate text and replaced it with the Judiciary Committee\u2019s desired text, including a new definition of \u2018state,\u2019 \" Lubben wrote.\n\nThe House version, under Democratic control, had the Chapter 9 bankruptcy exclusion for Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia.\n\nThat bill never passed, but in April 1981, Lubben found that the exclusion language \"resurfaced\" in the Senate.\n\n\"This exclusion was never discussed by Congress, at least publicly, and the language apparently simply materialized as a result of the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s extensive revision of the 1979 Senate \u2018technical corrections\u2019 bill,\" Lubben wrote.\n\nLubben told us that the text in Thurmond\u2019s 1984 amendment \"was essentially the same language that was kicking around since 1980.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s not even clear that the parties even understood what was going on,\" Lubben said. \"The only thing we can say for certain is the change happened without a whole lot of thought behind it.\"\n\nAnother factor makes it hard to find Thurmond\u2019s fingerprints on the text that beleaguers Puerto Rico today.\n\nThe change was never offered as a stand-alone item. It was always bundled with a number of other small changes. Law professor John Pottow at the University of Michigan told us, \"Strom Thurmond might have introduced that, but it\u2019s an overstatement to say he played a big role.\"\n\nA final mystery \u2014 if you\u2019ve followed the trail this far, you will notice that in 1984, the House version of the bill didn\u2019t have the Puerto Rico exclusion. The logical question is, why was it dropped when the House was the first to add it in 1980?\n\nWe wish we knew.\n\nOliver said \"we know that Thurmond proposed\" the text that stripped Puerto Rico of the right to let municipalities and public utilities declare bankruptcy. There is no question that Thurmond introduced the amendment with that change.\n\nSo technically, he did propose it. But there\u2019s no evidence that he came up with the idea, and experts question that he understood the significance of the change that would follow.\n\nThe statement is accurate but requires some additional information. We rate this claim Mostly True.\n\nThis fact-check previously contained erroneous references about the timing of Strom Thurmond's Senate career and Lin-Manuel Miranda's birthplace.", "lang": "en"}
