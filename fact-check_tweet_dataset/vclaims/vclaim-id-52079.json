The footage was a combination of the following clips spliced together:\n\u2022 a November 2015 Videoblocks clip of the USS Ohio in Malaysia\n\u2022 a November 2015 Shutterstock clip of the same ship; and\n\u2022 an October 2017 video of the United States Navy\u2019s nuclear-powered Virginia-class submarine, posted by Youtube channel US Defense News.\n\nThese misleading posts were published weeks after Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said Aug. 9 Russia is willing to loan the Philippines funds to acquire one of their Kilo-class submarines.\n\nOn Sept. 15, website pilipinohub.net also published a similar story, bearing the headline,\n\nIt carried images of helicopters and submarines.\n\nThe photos of seven submarines are screen grabs from a video by Russian defense ministry television network Zvezda of Russia\u2019s Project 636 Varshavyanka-class submarine. There has been no report, however, indicating that such a submarine is the underwater craft Russia is willing to sell to the Philippines.\n\nAll three misleading online posts could have reached more than 12.2 million people, with traffic to the stories largely coming from the pages PinasCitizen, The Philippines News and Philippines Reports.", "lang": "en"}
