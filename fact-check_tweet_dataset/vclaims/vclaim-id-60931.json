Its headline: \"New Report Shows Dems\u2019 Failed Stimulus Cost $278,000 Per Job As Economy Got Worse.\" It went onto claim that Sutton\u2019s \"government spending spree\" \"delivered little except skyrocketing debt owed to foreign countries like China.\"\n\n \n\n By 4:55 p.m., the National Republican Senatorial Committee had recycled the Weekly Standard blog posting to attack Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. This time the claim was: \"President Obama\u2019s own top economists estimate that the Obama-Brown stimulus debacle cost taxpayers an average $278,000 per job.\"\n\n \n\n PolitiFact Ohio thought the concerted GOP effort made it worthy of a look. Since Boehner kicked it off on Twitter, we\u2019ll use his tweet.\n\n \n\n The Weekly Standard blog item that spawned the statistic cites a July 1 report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which states the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \"saved or created between 2.4 and 3.6 million jobs as of the first quarter of 2011.\" It also tallies the sum of the stimulus bill\u2019s outlays and tax cuts at $666 billion.\n\n \n\n The $278,000 per job figure doesn\u2019t appear anywhere in the White House report. To come up with that number, the publication divided the $666 billion stimulus total by the low-end 2.4 million job estimate to come up with a dollars per job statistic that it rounded off to $278,000.\n\n \n\n The blog item contends this statistic \"provides further evidence that President Obama\u2019s \u2018stimulus\u2019 did very little, if anything, to stimulate the economy and a whole lot to stimulate the debt,\" and insists \"the government could simply have cut a $100,000 check to everyone whose employment was allegedly made possible by the \u2018stimulus\u2019 and taxpayers would have come out $427 billion ahead.\"\n\n \n\n After Republicans began to circulate the blog item, White House spokesman Jay Carney said its conclusions were \"based on partial information and simply false analysis.\" White House spokeswoman Liz Oxhorn issued a statement that noted the Recovery Act bolstered infrastructure, education, and industries \"that are critical to America\u2019s long-term success and an investment in the economic future of America\u2019s working families.\"\n\n \n\n The White House points out that Recovery Act dollars didn\u2019t just fund salaries - as the blog item implies - it also funded numerous capital improvements and infrastructure projects.\n\n \n\n Lumping all costs together and classifying it as salaries produces an inflated figure.\n\n \n\n Furthermore, the publication created its statistic with the report\u2019s low end jobs estimate. Had it instead gone with the 3.6 million job figure at the top end of the range, it would have come up with a smaller $185,000 per job figure.\n\n \n\n Republicans made a similar assertion in November 2009, using similar calculations to contend that the stimulus cost taxpayers more than $246,000 per job. Back then, they divided $160 billion in stimulus spending by 650,000 jobs that the White House estimated the measure had created or preserved. A \"fact check\" conducted at the time by the Associated Press called that math \"satisfyingly simple but highly misleading.\"\n\n \n\n \"Any cost-per-job figure pays not just for the worker, but for the material, supplies and that workers\u2019 output - a portion of a road paved, patients treated in a health clinic, goods shipped form a factory floor, railroad tracks laid,\" the 2009 Associated Press item noted.\n\n \n\n The Weekly Standard claimed that the stimulus actually \"has been working in reverse the last six months, causing the economy to shed jobs.\" It derives this conclusion from the fact that as of two quarters ago, the stimulus had added or saved just under 2.7 million jobs - or 288,000 more than it has now.\n\n \n\n Moody\u2019s chief economist Mark Zandi says the Weekly Standard misinterpreted that data.\n\n \n\n \"It\u2019s not that ARRA [the stimulus] is now costing the economy jobs, it is that the economy is now creating jobs without ARRA\u2019s help,\" Zandi told TPMDC. \"This is exactly the objective of fiscal stimulus, namely to end recession and jump-start economic recovery.\"\n\n \n\n The day after the White House responded to the GOP\u2019s dissemination of the Weekly Standard blog item, its author penned a defense that reiterates his claims. He says he never said that $278,000 per job went to salaries, but \"rather that each job has cost taxpayers $278,000.\" \n\n \n\n Yet, his original item did say taxpayers would have come out $427 billion ahead if the government had simply \"cut a $100,000 check to everyone whose employment was allegedly made possible by the \u2018stimulus?\"\n\n \n\n So where does that leave Boehner\u2019s tweet that said \"POTUS\u2019 economists: \u2018Stimulus\u2019 Has Cost $278,000 per job.\"\n\u2022 The figure attributed to the president\u2019s economists does not appear anywhere in the White House report.\n\u2022 Rather, the Weekly Standard attributed the number to economists at the White House after it made its own calculations and conclusions.\n\u2022 The methodology used to get that number was previously termed suspect because it lumps all costs associated with stimulus projects together as if they are wages, suggesting it would have been cheaper to just \"cut a $100,000 check\" to each person who found work as a result of the stimulus.\n\nOn the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Boehner\u2019s tweet (and the subsequent variations of his claim) as False.\n\n \n\n Comment on this item.", "lang": "en"}
