At 11 PM, Imam Hafiz Adnan at Lucknow\u2019s Jail Road mosque was fatally attacked by coward Sanghis-Bajrangis with a sword. -translated)\u201d. One Shaida Hussain posted the images with the same claim.\n\nOnline news platform National Dastakpublished a report with the same narrative that the Imam was attacked by RSS and Bajrang Dal members.\n\nSeveral people on Facebook and Twitter shared the photos with an identical narrative. A similar post by one Syed Hassanul Haque on Facebook was shared more than 1,600 times. According to the post, the Imam\u2019s name is Hafeez Adnan.\n\nA Google search revealed that an Imam at a mosque in Lucknow was indeed attacked. The incident took place on October 28. However, it may be noted that his name is not Hafeez Adnan but Abdul Mukim. According to Mukim, a man attacked him with a sharp weapon when he was resting in his room at around 11 PM. He suffered injuries on his head and right hand.\n\nOn October 29, Alambagh police lodged an FIR against the attacker under Section 307 (attempt to murder) and Section 452 (house-trespass) of the IPC. Two days later, Suraj Prajapati, a 19-year-old resident of Barabanki, was arrested by the police. According to a press note issued by the police, Prajapati confessed to entering the Imam\u2019s house, however, with the motive of robbery. Upon finding Mukim awake, he panicked and assaulted him twice with a pipe. Soon after, Prajapati fled the scene.\n\nIn conclusion, a case of a failed robbery wherein a man was brutally attacked by the robber was given a communal narrative by suggesting that the man was attacked by members of RSS and Bajrang Dal.", "lang": "en"}
