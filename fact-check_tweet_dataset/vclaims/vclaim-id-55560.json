Social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle identified 7 Facebook pages and 10 groups that shared the article on Facebook.\n\nAmong the pages that had the highest Facebook interactions are Supporters of Magdalo and Gary Alejano, LP Manila-Team Lagalag, and No To Marcos Burial At Libingan NG MGA Bayani.\n\nThe facts: While there is no line item in the proposed 2020 budget for a salary increase for teachers, there is an allocation for compensation adjustment for all government employees, including public school teachers. It is part of the miscellaneous personnel benefits fund (MPBF).\n\nIn the proposed 2020 NEP, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) earmarked P31.1 billion for \u201cpayment of compensation adjustment\u201d for all civil servants under the MPBF. The budget department has also said that it will submit to Congress in October a proposal for a fresh round of salary increases for civilian government workers in 2020.\n\nThe Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT Teachers) criticized the proposed allocation, saying that it is not enough for public school teachers to have a \u201csubstantial, reasonable, and living wage.\u201d\n\nDepartment of Education Secretary Leonor Briones had earlier clarified that she is not against salary hikes for teachers but stressed that all government workers should be taken into consideration, in addition to the country\u2019s present fiscal capacity. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
