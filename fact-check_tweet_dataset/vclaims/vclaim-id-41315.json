Their assessments varied, but all rejected Delaney\u2019s claim that the Sanders bill \u201cwill have every hospital closing.\u201d Some could close. Others might find themselves flush with new revenue. Some hospitals could take a financial hit, lay off staff, close a wing or two, but remain open. The government, meanwhile, could step in to control rates if needed.\n\n\u201cMedicare payments to health care providers are below the cost of providing care,\u201d Delaney spokesman Will McDonald wrote in an email. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, he said, \u201chas found that \u2018more than two-thirds of hospitals are losing money on Medicare inpatient services,\u2019 and according to the New York Times, Medicare pays hospitals \u2018only 87 cents for every dollar of their costs.\u2019 John has been asking this question at the rural hospitals he has visited over the course of the campaign, which also informs his statement.\u201d\n\nWhile the Sanders bill is not specific about how much hospitals would get paid under Medicare-for-all, it\u2019s a reasonable assumption that government-set prices would be less than what they get today from private insurers. However, with universal coverage, hospitals would no longer have uncompensated care. It\u2019s also quite possible that without deductibles and copays, the number of hospital admissions and outpatient visits could rise, boosting hospital revenues. The net effect on revenues would vary substantially from hospital to hospital. Hospitals in high-income suburban areas with lots of privately-insured patients might lose, while hospitals in low-income communities with lots of uninsured patients could win. It\u2019s very likely that hospitals would face heightened cost pressure under Medicare-for-all, but it\u2019s hard to envision an outcome where all or even many hospitals would actually shut their doors.\n\n\u201cThe important point is that while all the hospitals won\u2019t close, all of them would have to change their operations to deal with Medicare reimbursement,\u201d Garthwaite said. \u201cSo while today Medicare enrollees are quite happy because they go to hospitals where high-quality [service] and amenities are supported by profits on private patients, that won\u2019t be the case going forward. For there to be large savings, hospitals will need to change some of their operations \u2014 and this won\u2019t simply be about becoming more \u2018efficient.\u2019 It will involve some differences in service provision.\u201d Garthwaite added that \u201cit is possible that some safety net hospitals would be aided\u201d by the Medicare-for-all proposal.\n\n\u201cHospitals\u2019 cost structures are not set in stone, and they would change in response to implementation of a single payer system,\u201d he said. \u201cA harder question is how. In some cases, hospitals would find ways to cut out fat, while in other cases they might make changes that would negatively affect the quality of care. Additionally, facilities with relatively high costs might close, shifting more volume to more efficient facilities. In practice, some combination of these responses would occur, and any negative effects of cost cutting would need to be weighed against the benefits of lower health care prices.\u201d\n\nWhen we inquired about the federal government possibly adjusting hospital payment rates, as the Sanders bill would allow, McDonald said: \u201cPerhaps they could. But Medicare has been around and the rates that are in place are not adequate for many hospitals and that has not changed. And the Sanders bill states that the process will be the same. Moreover, it seems like assuming/waiting for future administrations to solve a major problem with the bill as written is a major issue.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
