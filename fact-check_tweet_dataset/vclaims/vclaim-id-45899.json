Their June 13 debate got heated.\n\nIn the debate, Jacobs, a state senator, brought attention to past tweets by McMuray, his rival to fill the 27th district vacancy created when Republican Rep. Chris Collins stepped down earlier this year.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of three assertions by Jacobs, with an analysis of their accuracy.\n\nJacobs said, \"Nate tweeted, \u2018Gun owners are part of the most insecure and dangerous club on earth.\u2019\"\n\nDuring the debate, McMurray countered that Jacobs \"is literally making stuff up.\"\n\nBoth sides have a point. McMurray did tweet about \"the most insecure and dangerous club\" last year, but Jacobs suggested that McMurray had targeted a broader group of gun owners for that description.\n\nJacobs was referring to an Aug. 3, 2019, tweet in which McMurray said, \"YOU WANT TO BE A MAN? Make something. Build something. Better, help someone. Serve someone. Care for them. Your damn assault rifle has no part in that. It just makes part of the most insecure and dangerous club in the world.\"\n\nKate Walker McArdle, McMurray\u2019s communication director, said Jacobs had unfairly conflated \"gun owners\" with \"assault rifle\" owners.\n\nMcMurray \"specifically referenced assault-style weapons in his tweet,\" she said. \"While Nate is a gun owner, he was also conveying the fact that owning an assault rifle doesn't make one a \u2018man.\u2019 His vision for America does not include assault weapons.\"\n\nSoon after, Jacobs said that McMurray had \"said the NRA are homegrown terrorists.\" (The NRA is the National Rifle Association, a prominent pro-gun group.)\n\nHere too, Jacobs has a point, though he oversimplifies a bit.\n\nOn March 8, 2018, McMurray tweeted a response to a video advertisement from NRATV, an NRA affiliate, that featured conservative commentator Dana Loesch holding a large hourglass.\n\nIn his tweeted response, McMurray wrote, \"If ISIS made a video as threatening as the NRA\u2019s hourglass offering, we would all be legitimately freaked out. Who is behind this \u2018genius\u2019 marketing? Are they channeling Margaret Hamilton in the Wizard of Oz? Yikes. #HomeGrownTerrorism\"\n\nSo McMurray did not outright call the NRA \"homegrown terrorists,\" his use of the hashtag above essentially aligns with Jacobs\u2019 claim.\n\nWalker McArdle told PolitiFact, \"This tweet was calling out the NRA for their scare tactics and videos that were highly scrutinized for threatening violence against Americans and journalists. (McMurray) did not say, \u2018the NRA is a terrorist organization.\u2019\"\n\nJacobs pulled a third claim from McMurray\u2019s Twitter feed before the end of the night.\n\nJacobs said, \"I am pro-life; (McMurray) is pro-abortion. He said abortion opponents are the American Taliban. That\u2019s another tweet of Nate McMurray.\"\n\nMcMurray has in fact referenced the \"Taliban\" or the \"American Taliban\" in tweets about abortion before.\n\nOn July 3, 2018, McMurray tweeted, \"DO THE MATH: 67% of the public is pro choice according to recent polls. Only 2 Republican members of Congress are pro-choice. 1 President actually said he wants to PUNISH women for abortion. Forget Democracy, forget mental health, act like the Taliban and PUNISH women. OR VOTE!\"\n\nWe found two other tweets in which McMurray does use the exact phrase, \"American Taliban.\"\n\nWalker McArdle countered, \"Nate did not use the phrase \u2018American Taliban.\u2019 Just as the phrase \u2018act like spoiled children\u2019 do(es) not literally mean that the person is a spoiled child, \u2018act like the Taliban\u2019 doesn\u2019t literally suggest someone is a member of the Taliban. But if the accusation is that Nate does not believe women should be punished for getting an abortion, that is correct.\"\n\nJacobs\u2019 campaign team did not provide any further information or context for what Jacobs said during the debate.\n\nJacobs said McMurray had said that \"gun owners are part of the most insecure and dangerous club on earth,\" that \"the NRA are homegrown terrorists,\" and that \"abortion opponents are the American Taliban.\"\n\nIn each case, McMurray did tweet something very close to what Jacobs cited in the debate, although sometimes with slightly different wording from what Jacobs used. The biggest divergence was in the first of these claims, in which McMurray was referring to people who own assault weapons rather than gun owners more generally.\n\nThe statements are accurate but need additional information, so we rate them Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
