It\u2019s not right to claim that Sir John Curtice has said there\u2019s \"absolutely no evidence\" for it - he has said the evidence is not \"consistent\".\n\nThis means it is still not entirely clear what the trend is, and whether a majority of the public back a second vote. As Professor Curtice has said, the uncertainty comes from the fact that polling responses can differ significantly depending on exactly what question is asked, and what the options for a hypothetical referendum would be.\n\nWhat John Curtice has said\n\nProfessor Sir John Curtice is a political scientist at Strathclyde University and the National Centre for Social Research, and is widely regarded as one of the UK\u2019s leading authorities on polling (and who has become well-known thanks to his regular appearances on the BBC).\n\nWe haven\u2019t been able to find any recent comments from him that suggest \u201cthere is absolutely no evidence of a swing in favour of a second referendum\u201d. He did tell the BBC on September 20 that \u201cthere is no consistent evidence of a shift in support for a second referendum\" - which isn\u2019t quite the same.\n\nHe has also repeatedly written in the past month that there is some evidence for such a swing. However, he has cautioned that different polls give very different results, and that it is unclear whether a majority of the public currently support it - hence his comment that the evidence isn't consistent.\n\nOn August 28, he wrote for the What UK Thinks: EU site that \u201cwhile there is some evidence that Chequers may have persuaded a few more voters of the merits of holding another ballot, we probably need more instances of the same question showing an increase in support since before the beginning of July before we can be sure that this is indeed what has happened.\u201d\n\nSome weeks later on September 18, he wrote for the BBC: \u201cThis idea [a referendum on the final deal] has gradually become more popular - even more so in the wake of the Chequers agreement. But there may still not be a majority in favour.\u201d\n\nAnd the following day he tweeted that some polls show a shift towards a second vote, but others do not:\n\nWhy is the picture unclear?\n\nPublic opinion over whether a second vote should be held the final deal agreed for exiting the EU is complicated by two main factors. One is how the opinion poll phrases the question, and the other is what options the hypothetical referendum would present to the voters.\n\nAs Professor Curtice wrote in his August 28 post, people\u2019s responses seem to differ depending on whether they are asked about a \u201csecond referendum\u201d, or whether they are asked if \u201cthe public\u201d should have a vote on the \u201cdeal\u201d. And because different polling companies have asked different questions at different times, it is hard to say with certainty how public opinion has shifted.\n\nPolls that mention \u201cthe public\u201d having a vote on the \u201cdeal\u201d (such as these from Opinium and these from BMG Research) have generally been more likely to show a majority in support of the vote. Polls that use the phrase \u201csecond referendum\u201d (such as this, also from Opinium) have generally been more likely to show a majority opposed to the vote.\n\nThe other issue is that there is no consensus on what options would be included in such a referendum. It could be a two-way choice between the final deal and remaining in the EU; a two-way choice between the final deal and leaving with no deal; or a three-way choice between the final deal, no deal, or remaining.\n\nAs Professor Curtice says, Remain supporters are (probably unsurprisingly) more likely to back a choice between the final deal and remaining, while Leave supporters are more likely to back a choice between the final deal and no deal.\n\nOne polling company, YouGov, has consistently asked the same question at regular intervals over the past year, which gives us the best opportunity to see if there is a long-term trend.\n\nTheir question is \u201cOnce the Brexit negotiations are complete and the terms of Britain's exit from the EU have been agreed, do you think there should or should not be a referendum to accept or reject them?\u201d. The polling since April 2017 suggests that there has been a shift in favour of a second referendum - from a clear majority against a second vote a year ago, to a roughly even split in recent polls. This has to be interpreted in light of the caveats mentioned above: the phrasing of the YouGov question has generally prompted responses more opposed to a second referendum than other polling, and it still doesn\u2019t show a clear majority in favour.\n\nConversely, some polls that have generally shown a majority in favour of a public vote on the deal have shown a slight move in the other direction, although they still show clear majorities supporting a referendum.\n\nThe only other regular poll we\u2019re aware of that consistently showed a majority opposed to a second referendum, from Opinium, has not polled on that question since the Chequers meeting that agreed the government\u2019s negotiating position.\n\nOn the balance of the evidence, it does seem more likely than not that there has been some shift of public opinion in favour of a referendum on the final deal - but it is not consistent across different polls, depends heavily on how the question is phrased, and it\u2019s hard to say how large the shift (if any) has been.", "lang": "en"}
