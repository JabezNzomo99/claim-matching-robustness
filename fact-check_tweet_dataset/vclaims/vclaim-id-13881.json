Here is an AFP report from after her arrest in February 2017 and here is a recent article in major newspaper Inquirer about her ongoing detention.\n\nThe photo, posted multiple times on Facebook for example here and here on March 29, 2019, where it has been shared more than 700 times, shows De Lima holding a document.\n\nThe papers in her hands have the words \u201cRepublic of the Philippines, Supreme Court Manila\u201d in the upper-right corner and give her name as the petitioner.\n\nThe document also purports to say: \u201cTo allow Mr. Ronnie Dayan to visit me even once a week.\u201d Dayan is De Lima\u2019s former lover and driver and she has spoken about their relationship to Philippine media. Here is an ABS-CBN report about the pair.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption, translated to English, says in capital letters: \u201cJust like a plant, De Lima also gets dried up and also needs to be watered. Uggghhh!\"\n\nDe Lima is a high-profile critic of Duterte and her arrest has drawn accusations from rights groups that the case is politically motivated, such as Amnesty International here.\n\nThe photo was taken as De Lima asked the Supreme Court to stop Duterte from securing private information about her in order to attack her. Here is a Senate press release on her petition.\n\nBoth the altered and the original photos contain these key details: De Lima wearing a black scarf, a pearl ring on her left hand and a video camera at the background.", "lang": "en"}
