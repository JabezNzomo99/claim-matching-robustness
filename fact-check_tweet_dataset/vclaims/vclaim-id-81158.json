On conducting a reverse search on the image, we found that it was a blueprint of the University of Virginia Hospital in Charlottesville, Virginia, US. We found the photo on the Linkedin page of the hospital. Further, we also came across a website of an architectural firm called Smith Group, which said that it had built the hospital and had been working with the University of Virginia on many projects. We found the same photo on their website as well, as well as a larger photo from a different angle. However, the UP Central Sunni Waqf Board had reportedly said back in February 2020 that there were talks about building an Indo-Islamic research centre, a hospital and a library on the five-acre plot, apart from the new mosque.\n\n\u201c...we are very keen to come up with a super-speciality hospital where the residents around can avail the best facilities...,\u201d said Athar Hussain, spokesperson of the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF), the trust formed to overlook the construction of the mosque on the land. In an interview with Hindustan Times, Hussain also added that they were considering a cultural centre on the land as well that would highlight the contributions of Indo-Islamic culture. Further, the Sunni Waqf Board has also issued a denial, calling the posts on social media about the Babri Hospital and Dr Kafeel Khan fake. \"Today, a fake news is being circulated on different social media platforms that \"UP Sunni Central Waqf Board has taken decision to build a Babri Hospital and Kafeel Khan will be director of the Hospital\", this news is mischievous and malafide..,\u201d a press release signed by SM Shoeb, the chief executive officer of the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board, said. We also came across a news report by The Times of India which said that the trust had lodged a complaint with the Lucknow Police Commissioner over the posts going viral on social media.", "lang": "en"}
