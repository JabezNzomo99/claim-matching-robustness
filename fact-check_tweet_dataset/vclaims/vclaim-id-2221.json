It should be noted that the VDC are no friends of Jaish al-Islam, whose members attacked [http://vdc-sy.net/new-attack-on-the-vdc-office-in-duma/] the montior\u2019s office in Douma on August 13.\n\nThe Syrian Local Coordination Committees (LCC) have continued to report regime artillery attacks, resulting in civilian casualties,on rebel-held areas of Damascus throughout August, with surface-to-surface missile strikes on the Ein Tarma suburb reported on the very same day the Russian embassy posted its tweet.\n\nIn Idlib, artillery attacks have been reported in Sukayk, near Maarat al-Numan, and Khan Sheikhoun, scene of the April 4 sarin attack.\n\nTo the south, the VDC continues to record civilian deaths due to government attacks in Daraa, Sweida, and Quneitra.\n\nWhile the casualty rate in Syria has certainly diminished over recent months, it is hard to justify the Russian claim that the Syrian civil war is already over.", "lang": "en"}
