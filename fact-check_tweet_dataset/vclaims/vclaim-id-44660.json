Public health agencies, including the Italian Ministry of Health, say COVID-19 is caused by a virus, not a bacterium. Viral infections are typically treated with antiviral drugs.\n\nThe viral post claims that Italian doctors have discovered by going \u201cagainst the World Health Organization\u2019s \u2018law\u2019 that no bodies receive autopsies\u201d that the coronavirus is \u201cnot a virus, but a bacterium.\u201d It further claims COVID-19 can be \u201ceasily treated with aspirin and coagulant.\u201d\n\nItalian medical experts did find in an autopsy-based study, which has not been peer-reviewed, that COVID-19 can cause blood clots that damage the lungs. However, they refer to COVID-19 as an \u201coutbreak caused by a new coronavirus infection,\u201d not a bacterial infection.\n\nThe Italian Ministry of Health continues to refer to coronavirus as a virus on its website. So do the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In March, it actually issued guidance on how to perform such autopsies safely.\n\nThe post\u2019s claim that aspirin and coagulants can \u201ceasily\u201d treat the virus doesn\u2019t hold up either. Viral infections require either vaccinations to prevent them or antiviral drugs to treat them, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. There is no specific treatment for COVID-19, according to the WHO.\n\n\u201cClotting is triggered by many illnesses,\u201d Agnes Lee, medical director of the Thrombosis Program at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe do not use aspirin or anticoagulants to treat infection. That\u2019s not the use for these medications.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that anticoagulants \u2014 not coagulants \u2014 are used to help prevent blood clots, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Coagulants promote blood clotting.\n\nThe post further undermines its credibility by making unfounded claims related to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and the WHO, saying Italy is \u201cdemanding Bill Gates and the World Health organization be held accountable for \u2018crimes against humanity.'\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation recently debunked the claim that the Italian Parliament called for Gates\u2019s arrest, and there is no evidence it has made such a demand about the WHO.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
