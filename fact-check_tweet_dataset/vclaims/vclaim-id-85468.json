But recent research indicates that, contrary to the spin by both sides, the ACA had minimal effect on employment, hours of work and compensation.\n\nBut here\u2019s the rub: The George Washington University experts whose research was the basis for the CAP report did their own study on the AHCA, which was published in June. They estimated a loss of 413,000 jobs by 2022, less than one-quarter of the two other estimates. (By 2026, the predicted job losses would reach 924,000.) Moreover, the researchers said that the repeal of tax cuts in the law would help to initially increase the number of jobs by 864,000 in 2018. Most of the long-term job losses would be in the health-care sector.\n\nThe authors of the CAP study and the GWU authors said they have not studied each other\u2019s work closely enough to understand why the results are different, even though CAP adapted the model used by GWU to come up with its much higher figure.\n\nMeanwhile, when the Congressional Budget Office in 2015 evaluated the impact of repealing the Affordable Care Act on the economy, it determined it would be a net plus, boosting economic output. We won\u2019t get into all of the technicalities, but the CBO focused on the impact of labor supply and demand, while the reports showing job losses from AHCA focus more on labor demand \u2014 the number of jobs that are available. (Right-leaning economists tend to focus more on labor supply \u2014 how many people choose to participate in the work force.)\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right that our analysis is mostly focused on changes in the demand for labor,\u201d said Leighton Ku, director of the Center for Health Policy Research at GWU. \u201cOur interpretation of the research about how the ACA changed labor supply is that the logic used by CBO in its earlier reports don\u2019t really square with subsequent experience and empirical analysis.\u201d\n\nHe said that \u201cwhile labor supply effects are important, they are highly uncertain\u201d and ambiguous. He noted that more recent economic research suggests that some of the predictions in CBO\u2019s report did not actually pan out and the ACA did not have the effect of suppressing employment \u2013 or have major effects increasing it either.\n\nKu said that CBO decided that because the law\u2019s expansion of Medicaid and the premium tax credits in Obamacare are income-related, it imposed marginal tax rates on new earnings, potentially discouraging people from working. (CBO also said that some 2.3 million workers stop working or reduce their hours because they could obtain health insurance without having to secure employment \u2013 an observation that was the source of many false job-killer claims by the GOP.)\n\nBut Ku argues the impact by the AHCA will be muted because it would not end but shift marginal rates, in ways that might reduce work incentives. He added that the tax credits are so low in the AHCA that they become irrelevant, making it harder for people to leave jobs.\n\nA key critique of these studies from right-leaning entities, such as the American Action Forum, is that they assume that less government spending means fewer jobs, when in fact that spending came mostly from additional taxes. Since each dollar spent by the government means one less dollar for a taxpayer to spend, the net effect on economic activity would be small, this argument goes.\n\nThe studies, however, do not assume the tax cuts and spending in the AHCA are necessarily equal, in large part because the tax cuts go mostly to the wealthy while the spending cuts mostly affect lower-income Americans. The impact thus is presumed to be different. The revised GWU study concludes the AHCA\u2019s tax cuts create more than 1 million jobs by 2026, but that\u2019s not enough to counter the nearly 2 million jobs lost through spending cuts on health care coverage.\n\nWe often warn readers to be wary of job claims made by politicians based on think-tank studies. This is a case in point. Pelosi was careful to say \u201cestimated,\u201d but two groups of researchers, using apparently the same economic model, came up with different estimates of jobs losses under the AHCA by 2022 \u2013 1.8 million and 413,000.\n\nMeanwhile, another economic model suggested 1.8 million lost jobs \u2013 while others perceived job gains. We don\u2019t doubt the care these economists took in creating these reports. But the nuances and caveats are often lost when the figures are used in political discourse. As we have shown, the overheated claims of job losses and job gains stemming from Obamacare turned out to be false. The impact appears to have been more muted than what either side had predicted.", "lang": "en"}
