We shall also make it a responsibility to collapse your presidency in December. You\u2019re a total disappointment too many. Many regrets.\u201d\n\nThe story which was flagged to Dubawa as part of its Third-Party Fact-checking project, since it was published two days ago, has been viewed over 9100 times on Facebook alone. It has also been shared on Facebook pages here, here and here.\n\nJust two weeks ago, another one of these fake tweets went viral, claiming the politician and businessman had stated that \u201cNDC\u2019s Naana Opoku Agyeman is far better than \u2018talkative\u2019 Bawumia\u201d. This claim was found to be fake in a report published by Dubawa Ghana.\n\nDubawa contacted corporate affairs representatives of Groupe Nduom. According to their official response, Dr. Nduom has nothing to do with the post. A representative had this to say,\n\n\u201cIt is a political time, all of these things will come out. That is why we have made it clear to everyone that this is Dr. Nduom\u2019s official handle. Any other person who uses his picture or anything is not coming from us, it\u2019s not coming from him, Dr. Nduom and if he wants to talk, he will use those handles and speak his mind or he will grant interviews if he so wishes\u201d.\n\nThe office further stated that the press statement dated July 10th, 2020, concerning the use of a fake account, @papakwesijunior, applies to this case as well, adding that any tweet from any account other than @pknduom should be disregarded.\n\nA Twitter search for the name Papa Kwesi Nduom revealed that other accounts, including the one responsible for the previous fake viral tweets, @papakwesijunior, exist under that alias with the names written differently including in his actual account @pknduom.\n\nNews reports discrediting these tweets have been published on various news platforms. See here and here also.\n\nOther checks suggest that this tweet could not have come from Dr. Nduom. Case in point is the unprofessional use of abbreviations in the tweet such as \u2018U\u2019 instead of \u2018You,\u2019 which raises suspicion as to the personality in question.\n\nDubawa further checked from the official Facebook page of Dr. Nduom to verify if this post, associated with him has been posted there as well. The findings reveal that was not the case, reinforcing doubts about the false tweet, since this has been Dr. Nduom\u2019s regular platform for all his public comments. The page also reveals that the last post by Dr.Nduom was on July 5th, 2020, containing a YouTube link providing information on the GN Banks Court Case\n\nThe account purporting to be that of Dr. Papa Kwesi Nduom\u2019s is a fake account. The politician did not claim that the current President pledged to collapse businesses belonging to people perceived to be his enemies and that the PPP will make it a point of duty to collapse Akufo-Addo\u2019s presidency in December.", "lang": "en"}
