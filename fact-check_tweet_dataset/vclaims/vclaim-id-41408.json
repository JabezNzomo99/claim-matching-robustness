The claim is false; the road in the photo is not one of the official projects listed under the program on the government\u2019s website.\n\n\n\nThe photo was shared here in a Facebook post on June 23, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe Tagalog language caption translates to English as: \u201cQuirino cor. Roxas Boulevard\u2026 This is the road that is under Build Build Build and the materials which were from China did not go through bidding!!! Go ahead and let the Chinese workers in also\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cQuirino cor. Roxas Boulevard\u201d refers to this intersection between Roxas Boulevard and Quirino Avenue in Manila.\n\n\u201cBuild Build Build\u201d refers to the flagship infrastructure program of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Here is a government press release about the program published on February 20, 2019.\n\nThe program was launched in 2017 according to this government web page published on April 24, 2017.\n\nThe caption also refers to loans and grants extended by China to the Philippines for projects under the \u2018Build Build Build\u2019 program. The projects include the Binondo-Intramuros and Estrella-Pantaleon bridges; the Chico River Pump Irrigation; and the New Centennial Water source-Kaliwa Dam, according to this government press release published on March 20, 2019.\n\nThe same photo was shared on Facebook with a similar claim here.\n\nThe claim is false; the road in the photo is not one of the official projects listed under the \u2018Build Build Build\u2019 program on the government\u2019s website; the misleading posts also provide inaccurate details about the accident location.\n\nA search on Google Street View found the accident in fact happened here on Remedios Street at the junction with Roxas Boulevard.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading posts (L) and the corresponding location on Google Street View (R)\n\nThis official website for the \u2018Build Build Build\u2019 program does not list either Remedios Street or Roxas Boulevard as a project.\n\nA keyword search found this report published about the accident by the Manila Bulletin on Sunday, June 23, 2019.\n\nThe report states: \u201cA 14-wheel truck loaded with tons of sand fell into a five-foot deep hole at the corner of Roxas Boulevard and Remedios Street in Manila before dawn Sunday.\n\n\u201cBut what was initially described as a \u201csinkhole\u201d turns out to be drainage culvert that collapsed under the weight of the truck.\u201d\n\nIn this post published on Facebook on June 23, Mark Villar, head of the Department of Public Works and Highways, said that the drainage culvert was constructed in the 1970s.\n\nA reverse image search on Google combined with a keyword search found the photo in the misleading posts was first published in this Facebook post on June 23, 2019.\n\nThe Tagalog caption translates to English as: \u201cWHILE I WAS BIKING ALONG ROXAS BLVD Truck was carrying sand that's why the road gave way\".\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the earlier Facebook post:", "lang": "en"}
