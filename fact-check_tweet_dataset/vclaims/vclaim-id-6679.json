You probably wouldn\u2019t include nurses who work in the community or health visitors, for example.\n\nBut there will be children\u2019s, maternity and mental health nurses who work on wards too, which means the focus on those working in adult general services is quite selective.\n\nThis matters, because the changes since 2010 look different depending on which types of nurse you\u2019re looking at.\n\nOverall nurses up 6,000, but not all types of nurse have seen numbers increase\n\nThe government\u2019s comparison isn\u2019t a fair one: it\u2019s comparing May 2010 to the figures from autumn last year. The problem with doing that is nurse numbers always increase a lot in November as newly-qualified nurses enter the workforce.\n\nThat said, this doesn\u2019t affect the headline claim by much in this particular case: comparing November 2016 with November 2010 would make the change 13,000.\n\nComparing November to November again, the overall number of nurses and health visitors working in hospital trusts and CCGs in England has risen by about 6,000 since 2010.\n\nBehind that figure, there are rises in some kinds of nursing and falls in others.\n\nThe bulk of nurses who work with adults in general services is up by about 13,000 \u2014that\u2019s the figure the government is highlighting. Children\u2019s nurses are also up by over 6,000 and health visitors by over 1,000.\n\nOn the flipside, community health nurses are down by over 5,000, mental health nurses are down by over 4,000 and nurses who work in maternity are also down by around 4,000.\n\nIt\u2019s not possible to know exactly which nurses you\u2019d see working on wards in these categories. If you included children\u2019s, maternity and mental health nurses along with the adult general nurses, the rise would be around 11,000, for example.\n\nSo there\u2019s still reason to think that nurses \u2018on wards\u2019 could be up by a similar order of magnitude to what the government is claiming, but we don\u2019t yet have figures to make the picture clearer.", "lang": "en"}
