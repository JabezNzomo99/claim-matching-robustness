Nope, that's not true, it is just the latest in a string of fake Banksy identity revelation stories. The identity of the famous street artist remains as it should be, shrouded in mystery.\n\nThis particular version was published on March 28, 2018 by satirical website The Onion titled \"Area Grandmother Comes Forward As 'Banksy'\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nFake news claiming to reveal the identity of Banksy is nothing new. The man most famous for doing that used to be Paul Horner. We covered it last time he pulled it off:\n\nUnfortunately Horner passed away about six months ago but he would probably have loved the idea of The Onion doing a twist on his signature hoax.\n\nThe Onion is one of the oldest and best known satire websites on the internet. Their about page claims:\n\nThe Onion is the world's leading news publication, offering highly acclaimed, universally revered coverage of breaking national, international, and local news events. Rising from its humble beginnings as a print newspaper in 1756, The Onion now enjoys a daily readership of 4.3 trillion and has grown into the single most powerful and influential organization in human history. In addition to maintaining a towering standard of excellence to which the rest of the industry aspires, The Onion supports more than 350,000 full- and part-time journalism jobs in its numerous news bureaus and manual labor camps stationed around the world, and members of its editorial board have served with distinction in an advisory capacity for such nations as China, Syria, Somalia, and the former Soviet Union. On top of its journalistic pursuits, The Onion also owns and operates the majority of the world's transoceanic shipping lanes, stands on the nation's leading edge on matters of deforestation and strip mining, and proudly conducts tests on millions of animals daily.\n\nIf you somehow find that hard to believe: you are right. Scroll down a bit futher on that page and you'll find this:\n\nWhat if I want to sue The Onion?\n\nPlease do not do that. The First Amendment protects satire as a form of free speech and expression. The Onion uses invented names in all of its stories, except in cases where public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental. The Onion is not intended for readers under 18 years of age.\n\nArticles from The Onion are frequently mistaken for real news by people on social media that only see the headline, short description and thumbnail image. Being one of the best known satire sites their articles also frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites that don't carry a satire disclaimer. Always Google before sharing something that sounds improbable!\n\nHere are some earlier hoaxes from The Onion we covered:\n\u2022 Fake News: McDonald's Did NOT Announce New Spearmint After-Dinner Big Mac\n\u2022 Fake News: Make-A-Wish Did NOT Send Terminally Ill Spider-Man To Healthy Kid\n\u2022 Fake News: NASA Did NOT Announce Plans To Launch Chimpanzee Into Sun\n\u2022 Satire: Scientists Warn All Plant Life Dying Within 30-Yard Radius Of Ted Cruz Campaign Signs", "lang": "en"}
