No, that's not true: a headline making that claim only offers up one tweet from Kaepernick as evidence and that tweet doesn't even contain Kaepernick's own words (or even the phrase \"worst country in the world\"). Since the story was originally published it has been copy-pasted by several foreign-run fake news websites that have further spread the unsubstantiated claim.\n\nThe story originated from an article (archived here) where it was published by The David J. Harris Jr. on July 5, 2019 under the title \"Nike Spokesman Colin Kaepernick Calls the United States the Worst Country in the World\".

The quote comes from a speech given by anti-slavery campaigner Fredrick Douglass on July 5, 1852, years before the U.S. Civil War and while slavery still being practiced in the United States.\n\nQuoting a speech that criticizes past practices in the United States made by someone at the time these practices were actually going on is a far cry from saying the country is the \"worst in the world\" right now. Even if it is paired with a video decrying current police violence.\n\nA search of Kaepernick's Twitter account for the phrase \"worst country\" yields no results at the time of writing.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes davidharrisjr.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability. Read their full assessment here.\n\nWhile it is perfectly fine to disagree with Colin Kaepernick's views and it is definitely OK to criticize the way in which he chooses to express them, it is not right to falsely attribute quotes to him.\n\nSaying that the United States has some flaws that should be fixed does not equate with saying it is the \"worst country in the world\". If that were true Donald Trump's own campaign slogan (\"Make America Great Again\") would imply the same thing since it suggests America isn't \"great\" at the moment.", "lang": "en"}
