The policy also set a date of July 1, 2017, for allowing transgender individuals to join the armed forces. The delay was designed to develop training plans, revise regulations and forms, and implement guidance.\n\nOn June 30, the Defense Department under Trump delayed the start date for accepting transgender service members until Jan. 1, 2018. In a June 30 memo obtained by the Associated Press, Defense Secretary James Mattis told service chiefs and secretaries that he would \u201cuse this additional time to evaluate more carefully the impact of such accessions on readiness and lethality.\u201d\n\nHowever, in a series of tweets, Trump abruptly announced the policy change before the end of the six-month review period.\n\nLet\u2019s look at what we know about the number of transgender individuals currently serving in the military and their potential impact on health care costs and military readiness.\n\nIn making his announcement that the military would accept transgender service members, Carter said that \u201cthere isn\u2019t definitive data on the number of transgender service members.\u201d But he cited RAND\u2019s study of existing estimates \u201cand their best estimate was that about 2,500 people out of approximately 1.3 million active-duty service members, and about 1,500 out of 825,000 reserve service members are transgender.\u201d Those were mid-range estimates with the upper end of the ranges being 6,630 for active duty and 4,160 for the reserves.\n\nSo we are talking about a small subset of active and reserve service members. The number of service members that would seek gender transition\u2013related medical treatment is even smaller.\n\nPrivate health insurance data show that \u201c0.022 to 0.0396 annual claimants per 1,000 individuals\u201d seek transition-related health care each year. Based on that, RAND estimated that anywhere from 29 to 129 active-duty service members would seek such medical treatment each year among the force of 1.3 million members.\n\nAlthough Trump described the cost as \u201ctremendous,\u201d RAND estimated that providing transition-related health care would increase the military\u2019s health care costs for active-duty members \u201cby between $2.4 million and $8.4 million annually.\u201d That represents an increase of no more than 0.13 percent of the $6.27 billion spent on the health of active-duty members in fiscal 2014.\n\nAs for military readiness, the RAND report said: \u201cSimilarly, when assessing the readiness impact of a policy change, we found that less than 0.0015 percent of the total available labor-years would be affected, based on estimated gender transition\u2013related health care utilization rates. This is because even at upper-bound estimates, less than 0.1 percent of the total force would seek transition-related care that could disrupt their ability to deploy.\u201d\n\nThe report was less definitive regarding the impact of transgender individuals on \u201cunit cohesion.\u201d RAND said its review of data from the civilian population, foreign militaries, and previous integration experiences of gays, lesbians and women \u201csuggest a minimal impact on unit cohesion.\u201d But it acknowledged that its conclusion \u201cmay not hold for transgender service members.\u201d\n\nUpdate, July 28: In a July 27 memo, Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, notified commanders in the various branches of the armed forces that the Pentagon would not change its policy on transgender service members until the White House provides formal guidance, according to the Los Angeles Times. \u201cIn the meantime, we will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect,\u201d Dunford said in his memo. Defense Department spokeswoman Dana W. White reiterated that message in a separate statement issued the same day that said the department will ensure \u201call service members are treated with respect.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
