You can watch the video here and access its archived version here.\n\nThe five-year old video has been debunked by BOOM earlier too. While earlier the video was viral with a claim that Islamic State was auctioning sex slaves, it has resurfaced with a different claim now. The video, shot in 2014, was a mock auction organised by a Kurdish activist as part of a protest against ISIS in London. The women shown in chains in the video are actors. The group was trying to raise awareness on about the plight of women taken by ISIS as sex slaves.", "lang": "en"}
