The comparison to the Russian probe is overblown and facile. One fundamental difference is that Ukraine is considered a U.S. ally, and Russia is considered an adversary. Moreover, U.S. intelligence officials found a top-down effort, initiated by Russian President Vladimir Putin, to illegally hack and release information in a deliberate attempt to meddle in the U.S. election and undermine the democratic system. There is no such evidence of a top-down effort in the Ukrainian case.\n\nHere, Trump reprises a Four-Pinocchio claim from the presidential campaign. Andrew McCabe, who is now the acting FBI director, became part of the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails long after his wife, Jill McCabe, unsuccessfully ran for a Virginia senate seat. The political action committee of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) gave $452,500 to McCabe, and the state Democratic Party gave her campaign an additional $207,788. That was about one-third of the $1.8 million budget for her campaign. McAuliffe is close to Clinton, but there is no evidence she knew of the contributions. Moreover, it stretches the imagination that McAuliffe would know that the husband of someone he was supporting in a Virginia legislative race was going to be promoted months later to a position of authority in the email case.\n\n\n\nTrump conflates a number of issues here in his continuing effort to force his attorney general from office. The Clinton email issue was exhaustively investigated by the FBI, with the conclusion a year ago that she was \u201cextremely careless\u201d in her handling of classified information but did not intend to violate any laws. \u201cIn looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts,\u201d FBI Director James B. Comey said in July 2016.\n\nThere is no evidence that Clinton was involved in the question of whether the Democratic National Committee\u2019s servers should be turned over to the FBI as part of the investigation into Russian-linked hacking. The FBI and the Democratic National Committee disagree on whether the FBI requested access to the DNC\u2019s servers. Comey testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee that the bureau made \u201cmultiple requests at different levels\u201d to access the DNC\u2019s servers, but the DNC said the FBI never requested access. The DNC ultimately allowed a private company, CrowdStrike, to review its database and share findings with the FBI. \u201cWe got the forensics from the pros that they hired which \u2014 again, best practice is always to get access to the machines themselves, but this my folks tell me was an appropriate substitute,\u201d Comey said.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting here that the DNC was the victim in this instance, and yet Trump without evidence seems to be accusing it of a crime.", "lang": "en"}
