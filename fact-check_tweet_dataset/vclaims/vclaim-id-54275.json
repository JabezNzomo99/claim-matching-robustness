No, that's not true: This is a photo of a Thai baker's hyper-realistic bread sculptures of bloody human body parts. His terrifying loaves have been covered by news outlets like The Associated Press, Buzzfeed, Huffington Post, and CNN.\n\nThe claim appeared in a post (archived here) where it was published on Rotten.com's Facebook page on February 7, 2013. The caption read:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nRotten.com used to post misleading and gruesome content on its website and Facebook page, but both have been dormant since late 2018. Although the photo in question was posted on Rotten.com's Facebook page over seven years ago, it recently gained traction on social media.\n\nCNN reported in a 2010 story on the baker, Kittiwatt Unarrom:\n\nBuzzfeed had this to say:\n\nThe photo that is wrongly claimed to be from a Chinese market can be found here, in a series of photos of Unarrom's other grusome baked goods.", "lang": "en"}
