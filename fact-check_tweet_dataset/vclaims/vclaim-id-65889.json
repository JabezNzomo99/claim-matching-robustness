Companies. Bodenstedt\u2019s connection to Wendy\u2019s is known: His company owns hundreds of Wendy\u2019s, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut franchises across the country.\n\nIn May, a Business Insider report revealed that Bodenstedt donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nAccording to Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings, since 2018, Bodenstedt has donated around $440,000 to Trump\u2019s campaign, including a March 12, 2020, donation of $200,000 to the Trump Victory PAC (political action committee). In May 2020, Bodenstedt also joined a roundtable discussion with Trump and restaurant-industry leaders to talk about the field\u2019s recovery from the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn response to the backlash, Wendy\u2019s \u2014 known for its snarky approach to social media \u2014 responded to the backlash with a tweet:\n\nWhile this tweet is accurate, CNN found that Wendy\u2019s CEO Todd Penegor donated around $6,000 to the Wendy\u2019s PAC. The PAC hasn\u2019t donated to any presidential campaigns, but has donated to more Republican than Democrat congressional candidates.\n\nAfter the outrage on social media grew, Wendy\u2019s also announced that they will donate $500,000 toward supporting \u201csocial justice, the youth and education in the Black community.\u201d In a series of tweets, they said:\n\nBecause Wendy\u2019s CEO did not donate to Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, and the donation came instead from the CEO of a company that operates Wendy\u2019s franchises, we rate this claim as \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
