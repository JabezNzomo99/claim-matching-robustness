The latest misinformation going viral on Facebook shows a video claiming the love of the voters for BJP leader Shivraj Singh Chouhan despite the party being ousted in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe video, which shows Madhya Pradesh's former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan blowing a flying kiss and responding to someone's 'I love you' at a public rally, has a message in Hindi which loosely translates to \"Ousted him from power... but how will you oust him from the hearts\" (\u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e \u0938\u0947 \u0924\u094b \u0928\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0932 \u0926\u093f\u092f\u093e..\u0926\u093f\u0932 \u0938\u0947 \u0915\u0948\u0938\u0947 \u0928\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0932\u094b\u0917\u0947!! )\n\nThe archived version of the Facebook post can be accessed here.\n\nThe video, that was posted on Facebook page Politics Solitics on December 13, has been shared over 500 times now. The BJP leader and former chief minister can be seen here interacting with the public when someone from the crowd screams, \"Mamaji, I love you.\" Chouhan then looks at the crowd, smiles, and says: \"I love you too.\" He also blows a flying kiss towards the person concerned.\n\nA cursory glance at the video may make it look like it has been shot at a rally. However, we have found that the video is over a year old, and had been covered in newspaper reports. You can read some of the reports here and here.\n\nGoing by the media reports, the video was reportedly shot at a rally in Mungawali village in Madhya Pradesh on October 17, 2017. The video, which was then shared widely online, had left the internet, specially twitter, in splits.\n\nChouhan had also mentioned this incident in a speech at his Aashirwad Yatra as part of his election campaign. He could be heard crediting his reaction to his love for the youth of Madhya Pradesh. You can watch the video below.", "lang": "en"}
