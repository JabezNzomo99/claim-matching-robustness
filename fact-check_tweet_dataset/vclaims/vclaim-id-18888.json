Numerous websites also published stories reporting that Trump had crashed the wedding. All of these claims, as portrayed in the following tweet, are misleading.\n\n\n\n The image is a screen capture from a video taken at the July 20, 2019, wedding of PJ and Nicole Mongelli, who held their nuptials at Trump\u2019s golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. PJ Mongelli told us in a phone interview that Trump didn\u2019t \u201ccrash\u201d their wedding \u2014 he was an invited guest. Although the couple didn\u2019t know whether the president would accept, they sent him multiple invitations to ensure that he knew he was welcome.\n\n\u201cWe sent him about four invitations just to make sure he knew we were inviting him,\u201d Mongelli told us. \u201cAll the news media outlets saying he crashed the wedding, that\u2019s not the case. We invited him multiple times.\u201d\n\nThe image being widely shared on social media is not only cropped, it also shows only a brief moment in time that casts the moment Trump leaned in to give the bride a peck on the cheek in a negative light, as characterized by this example of such a post on Twitter:\n\n\n\n But video from the event doesn\u2019t display any evidence of groping. Instead it shows Trump embracing the couple while their guests cheered. PJ Mongelli was not looking on in dismay while Trump kissed his bride, but was instead pumping his fist and chanting, \u201cUSA! USA! USA!\u201d Both bride and groom were clearly ecstatic, an emotion they expressed in an interview with Fox News two days after their wedding.\n\nPJ Mongelli said the internet reaction to their sudden moment of fame on account of the president\u2019s appearance at their wedding has been \u201cdisgusting.\u201d He said his wife was forced to set her Instagram account to \u201cprivate\u201d because of a flood of disturbing comments, some of which were derogatory and graphic.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you could print the stuff I would like to say [about that],\u201d he said. \u201cLike my father always taught me, it\u2019s always nice to be nice. I respect everybody\u2019s opinion. We may agree to disagree, but I\u2019m not going to say something so appalling and disturbing that it ruins your day or your moment.\u201d\n\nHe said he was particularly disturbed by a tweet from actress Bette Midler, who wrote she \u201cmay hurl\u201d after viewing the image. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just say, \u2018Wow that\u2019s a beautiful thing\u2019? People don\u2019t do the right thing, and I don\u2019t like that,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the couple is still happy with the way things went. He said he was very happy \u201cthat the leader of the free world was at my wedding and hugging me and my wife, showing the type of character that he has. It was just a beautiful thing. It\u2019s \u201cunreal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re still riding on on a cloud.\u201d He\u2019s hoping the incident results in an invite to visit the White House.", "lang": "en"}
