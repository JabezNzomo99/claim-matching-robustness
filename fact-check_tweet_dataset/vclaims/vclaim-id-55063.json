A spokesperson for the CDC has confirmed it is fabricated.\n\nSocial media platforms have become replete with misinformation about the face coverings meant to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\nThis particular image shows a document, purportedly from the CDC, that makes several dubious claims about face masks, including that cloth masks \u201ctrap carbon dioxide\u201d and \u201cbecome mildew ridden in 30 minutes.\u201d It appears to bear the CDC letterhead.\n\n\u201cCLOTH MASK: (DO NOT FILTER ANYTHING),\u201d reads part of the alleged document. \u201cAs you exhale, you are ridding your lungs of contaminants and carbon dioxide. CLOTH MASKS trap this carbon dioxide the best. It actually risks your HEALTH, rather than protect it. The moisture caught in these masks will become mildew ridden in 30 minutes. Dry coughing, enhanced allergies, sore throat are all symptoms of micro-mold in your mask.\u201d\n\nThe document cannot be found anywhere on the CDC\u2019s website. Had the CDC put out a document making such claims, it would have been picked up by major news outlets, yet none have. Jasmine Reed, a CDC public affairs specialist, told The Associated Press that it is fake.\n\n\u201cCDC typically does not issue guidance or recommendations to the public in such a format,\u201d Reed told The Associated Press. (RELATED: Did Florida\u2019s Surgeon General Recommend People Stop Wearing Face Masks?)\n\nIn recent months, the Daily Caller has debunked claims that face masks cause dangerous levels of carbon dioxide in the blood and fungal lung infections that result in emergency room visits. While public health officials do recommend washing cloth face masks after each use, there is no evidence one poses a health risk of mildew build-up after only 30 minutes, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration notes that surgical masks do not block \u201cvery small particles in the air that may be transmitted by coughs, sneezes, or certain medical procedures.\u201d However, they do provide protection against \u201clarge droplets, splashes, or sprays of bodily or other hazardous fluids,\u201d as well as protect others from the wearer\u2019s respiratory emissions, per the CDC.\n\nWhile the CDC does recommend against the general public using N95 respirators, it is not because they are ineffective. The CDC website states \u201csurgical masks and N95 respirators are critical supplies that should be reserved for health care workers and other first responders.\u201d\n\nThe CDC states on its website that people should wear face coverings, which help prevent people with COVID-19 from spreading it to others, in public where social distancing measures cannot be maintained.", "lang": "en"}
