(The liberal website Media Matters for America a timeline of the events as they spread on Fox News; the ISIS-tweet narrative lasted several hours.)\n\nThe ISIS tweet before people noticed the real timestamp of the pro-ISIS tweet.\n\nIn an interview with PunditFact, Geller said that at the time she wrote her tweet, she was not aware that \"Twitter's time stamping was not uniform.\"\n\n\"I updated the post when new information became available,\" Geller said.\n\nWe have not been able to find any additional tweets from Geller indicating the incorrect timestamp from her first tweet, which is still still online.\n\nGeller did post an to one of her website articles about the ISIS tweet and timestamp issue. article on her website has not yet been updated.\n\nAuthorities are still investigating whether there is an ISIS connection. The shooter, Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez, was killed by police.\n\nOn her website, Geller that the ISIS tweet was posted before the shooter was named or \"before we knew that the killer was a devout Muslim waging jihad,\" which to her is enough proof that the shooting was at least ISIS-inspired.\n\nOther news sources have been more careful in describing Abdulazeez\u2019s possible motivations or allegiances. ABC News Abdulazeez as a \"disturbed (and) suicidal\" man who wrote about \"becoming a martyr.\" Still, Abdulazeez apparently called ISIS a \"stupid group \u2026 completely against Islam\" during a with a friend, according to CNN.\n\nThere are also different interpretations of Abdulazeez\u2019s seven-month trip to Jordan. Family members the trip was intended to \"get (Abdulazeez) away from bad influences in the U.S.\" A government source CBS that Abdulazeez did not travel outside of Jordan during his visit and there is no proof of him visiting Iraq or Syria. But a close friend of Abdulazeez said after coming back.\n\nGeller claimed that an ISIS supporter tweeted ahead of the Chattanooga shooting. The claim gained a lot of traction before it became clear that the tweet happened a few hours after the shooting.\n\nGeller updated the original post, but it did little to stuff the rumor back into the bag.", "lang": "en"}
