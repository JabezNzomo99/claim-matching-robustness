From a Facebook group \u2018We Support Narendra Modi\u2019, the post has received 64,000 shares. Several people commenting on the video have called for the murder of \u2018such protestors\u2019. Many others have used filthy language targeting the Muslim community.\n\nAmit Bajaj, the person who shared the video on the group, wrote, \u201cThis is the proof. They are being paid for rioting and stone-pelting. (\u092f\u0947 \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0938\u092c\u0941\u0924 \u0926\u0902\u0917\u093e \u092d\u0921\u0915\u093e\u0928\u0947,\u092a\u0924\u094d\u0925\u0930 \u092e\u093e\u0930\u0923\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u092f\u0947 \u0926\u093f\u092f\u0947 \u0917\u092f\u0947 \u092a\u0948\u0938\u0947.)\u201d The video is viral with the same message on Facebook.\n\nAsianet News penned an article on the video, claiming that protesters in Shaheen Bagh distributed money to women.\n\nSeveral users have also shared the video with the \u2018Shaheen Bagh\u2019 claim. This included Tarek Fatah and BJP Delhi general secretary Kuljeet Singh Chahal.\n\nAlt News found that Chennai-based activist Chandra Mohan went to the same location and recorded a video debunking social media claims. \u201cOn that day, this was on [February] 28th, this place is basically called Babu Nagar, A block, Gali number 9. A lot of people from Shiv Vihar \u2013 the victims affected in Shiv Vihar \u2013 have come over here. A lot of them are staying here because they have lost their homes. So the people here magnanimously opened their heart and homes, and they\u2019re all [the victims] are staying in different homes here.\u201d\n\nChandra Mohan subsequently introduced a man named Shahzad Malik: \u201cHe is the one you saw in the video distributing cash. Mr Malik is right here. In fact, we asked him to wear the same dress so that you know we\u2019re telling the truth.\u201d Chandra Mohan claimed that Malik provided ration to victims but it was eventually exhausted due to the large number of victims. \u201cThis man has a big heart. He gave Rs 70,000 of his own money. He gave Rs 500 to each person\u2026People who cannot see good in anything, because they can\u2019t do good, they spread lies,\u201d said Chandra Mohan. Below Alt News has visually compared the location as seen in the viral video and Chandra Mohan\u2019s video. The similarities have been colour-coded.\n\u2022 Green: The drain between the wall and the ally. A broken helmet on a pile of garbage near the drain is also visible in both videos. Speaking with Alt News, Chandra Mohan said, \u201cThis place is in Old Mustafabad. It is called Babu Nagar, Gali number 9. I\u2019m a social and political activist from Chennai. I came to Delhi five days ago so that I could do some relief and rescue work. I connected with some youngsters from trade unions who have been doing this work. So I joined them, we just shifted to old Mustafabad which is right next to Shiv Vihar \u2013 one of the worst affected areas. A lot of victims who lost their homes came here for refuge. We set up a relief base here. Yesterday was the first time I saw the video so I asked locals around here and one of them said they know the person who distributed the money. Since this was in the same locality where we set up our base, it wasn\u2019t difficult for us [to debunk the video].\u201d Chandra Mohan also said that Shahzad Malik, the man who was seen handing out money, has original videos of the relief work. Below is an extended version of the viral video where women can be seen standing in a queue to collect cash. In the background, women can be heard taking Shahzad\u2019s name and the people distributing cash can be heard saying \u2013 \u201conly those who need help.\u201d We have also attached a video of ration being distributed.\n\nAlt News spoke with Shahzad Malik as well. He has been highlighted in red below. \u201cI have a business of car polish. There are a lot of people here who lost their homes in the fire. Some ration was arranged from outside to be distributed to these people but there were some 100-150 women who had nothing. Some of them also had children. I could not see their plight. I went home, got money and distributed Rs 500 each. Now someone has shot the video and circulated it with a false claim. This video was shot on February 28. Only 30 seconds have been put out on social media. My video is of 3 minutes and I am also saying in the video that only the neediest should take help. But they have edited this out,\u201d he informed.\n\nThe misinformation that anti-CAA protesters are being paid money to agitate is repeatedly promoted on social media. This time around a video of a person giving cash to victims of Delhi riots as part of relief work was misused to propagate the same. Earlier, a video amplified by Amit Malviya \u2013 alleging that Shaheen Bagh women are receiving Rs 500 and biryani to protest \u2013 was debunked in a joint effort by Alt News and Newslaundry.", "lang": "en"}
