The posts include an additional claim that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said bubonic plague can be spread through cough droplets. The claims are misleading; the WHO has said the bubonic plague case is not high-risk and is \u201cbeing well managed\u201d; the CDC states bubonic plague is usually caused by flea bites.\n\nThe claim was published on Facebook here on July 7, 2020. It has been shared more than 1,700 times.\n\nThe post's caption claims to contain accurate information from the WHO and the CDC about bubonic plague.\n\nThe photo included in the post shows a wax sculpture that depicts a bubonic plague patient.\n\nThe misleading claim circulated online just days after a bubonic plague case was reported in Inner Mongolia, an autonomous region in northern China, on July 5, 2020, according to this AFP report.\n\nA similar claim has also been shared hundreds of times here, here and here on Facebook, and here on Twitter.\n\nThe post states in part: \"BREAKING: Bubonic plague is back? / A highly contagious and fatal disease confirmed in China and can trigger severe epidemic according to WHO... Modern antibiotics can present complications and death if administered quickly enough.\"\n\nThe claim is misleading; the WHO has in fact said the reported bubonic plague case is \u201cbeing well managed\u201d.\n\nThe bubonic plague is the \u201cmost common form of plague and is caused by the bite of an infected flea\u201d according to the WHO.\n\nWHO spokesperson Margaret Harris was quoted in this July 7 AFP report as saying: \u201cWe are looking at the case numbers in China. It's being well managed. At the moment, we are not considering it high-risk but we're watching it, monitoring it carefully.\u201d\n\nThis WHO information sheet states: \u201cAlthough plague has been responsible for widespread pandemics throughout history, including the so-called Black Death that caused over 50 million deaths in Europe during the fourteenth century, today it can be easily treated with antibiotics and the use of standard preventative measures.\u201d\n\nAnother part of the claim states: \u201cBubonic plague is airborne and can be spread when an infected person coughs, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.\u201d\n\nThis is also misleading.\n\nAccording to the CDC, \u201cBubonic plague... usually results from the bite of an infected flea.\u201d\n\nPneumonic plague, another form of the disease that may develop from untreated bubonic plague, \u201cis the only form of plague that can be spread from person to person (by infectious droplets),\u201d the CDC said.", "lang": "en"}
