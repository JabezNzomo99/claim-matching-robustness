Does it beholds the Prime Minister of the country to use profanity and that too publicly? Shocking beyond belief !! Have some respect for the chair, if nothing else.\u201d\n\nThe above message has been tweeted by Gaurav Pandhi, along with a video which has been superimposed with the words \u2018Modi said BC at a rally\u2019. Pandhi is associated with the Congress party. His tweet has been retweeted over 3200 times and \u2018liked\u2019 over 6200 times so far.\n\nThe video has been circulating widely not only on social media platforms but also on WhatsApp, with the narrative that the Prime Minister had used profane language. Modi was speaking at a rally in Patan, Gujarat.\n\nThe assertion that Prime Minister Narendra Modi uttered the word \u2018bh******\u2019 at the rally, is false. This is what PM Modi had said at the rally:\n\n\u201cLoko em keh chhe bhavish ma ladao pani ni thavan(i) chhe. Alya bhai badha ko chho pani ni ladai thavan(i) chhe to pachhi ame atyare thi pani pela paar kem na bandhiye.\u201d (Translation: People say wars of the future will be fought over water. If everyone says there will be water wars then why shouldn\u2019t we build check dams from now?)\n\nThe words \u2018thavan(i) chhe\u2019, which PM Modi can be heard uttering the second time in the video clip, has been wrongly interpreted as \u2018bh******\u2018. \u2018Thavan(i) chhe\u2019 roughly translates to \u2018Will happen/going to happen\u2019. The classical usage is \u2018thavani chhe\u2019, but PM Modi says \u2018thavan chhe\u2019, which is colloquial usage. Repeatedly playing the word \u2018thavan(i) chhe\u2019, as was done in the video clip, creates the illusion that PM Modi said \u2018bh******\u2019. The entire video of the speech has been posted on the official handle of the BJP and can be seen below. The relevant portion begins from 49:08.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that Prime Minister Narendra Modi indulged in profanity during his speech at Patan, Gujarat is patently false. Gaurav Pandhi has not deleted his tweet despite several users pointing out the same.", "lang": "en"}
