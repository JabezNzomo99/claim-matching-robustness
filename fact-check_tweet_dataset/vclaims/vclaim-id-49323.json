Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Photo of road full of potholes in Rahul Gandhi\u2019s constituency Wayanad. Fact: Image in the post shows the condition of Bhagalpur-Pirpainty- Mirzachowki National highway-80 at Bhagalpur district in Bihar. It is not from Rahul Gandhi\u2019s constituency Wayanad. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWe did a reverse image search of the photo shared in the post and found a similar photo in a tweet posted by a random user in twitter. In that tweet, it is described as the condition of Bhagalpur-Pirpainty National Highway in Bihar. Based on this information we searched for additional information using keywords. We found the same photo in an article published by \u2018Times of India\u2019 news website in 2017, with the title \u2018Bhagalpur NH-80 in a bad shape\u2019. In that article, it is mentioned that the photo shows the condition of Bhagalpur-Pirpainty- Mirzachowki National highway-80 in Bhagalpur, Bihar.\n\nWhen the same image went viral in 2017, the then Bihar Road and Transport Minister Tejaswi Yadav tweeted that the image doesn\u2019t show the ground reality. \u2018ABP Live\u2019 news channel investigation revealed that the photo is of the national highway in Bhagalpur district in Bihar but shows its condition from two months prior to it going viral, and a new road has been laid by the time of their visit.\n\nTo sum it up, an old photo of a road from Bhagalpur district in Bihar is falsely shared as the condition of the roads in Rahul Gandhi\u2019s constituency Wayanad.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
