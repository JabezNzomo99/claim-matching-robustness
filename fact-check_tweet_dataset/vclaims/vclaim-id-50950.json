{"title": "Did Lewis Carroll Say 'Everyone Wants a Magical Solution for Their Problem'?", "subtitle": "There are many lands: some of them have magic, some do not, and some need it.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2020-01-16T13:05:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-50950", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/lewis-carroll-magical-solution/", "vclaim": "Author Lewis Carroll wrote that \"Everyone wants a magical solution for their problem, and everyone refuses to believe in magic.\"\n\nThe concept of \u201cmagical thinking\u201d is perhaps best exemplified by what we commonly call superstition, as described by Scientific American:\n\nWhen it comes to superstitions, social scientists have generally agreed on one thing: they are fundamentally irrational. \u201cMagical thinking\u201d (as it has been called) is defined as the belief that an object, action or circumstance not logically related to a course of events can influence its outcome. In other words, stepping on a crack cannot, given what we know about the principles of causal relations, have any direct effect on the probability of your mother breaking her back. Those who live in fear of such a tragedy are engaging in magical thought and behaving irrationally.\n\nA statement about the yin and yang of magical thinking is frequently shared online, attributed to either author Lewis Carroll (the pen name of Charles Dodgson) or the most famous of his literary works, \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d (i.e., \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland\u201d):\n\nHowever, the phrase \u201cEveryone wants a magical solution for their problem, and everyone refuses to believe in magic\u201d does not appear in any of Carroll/Dodgson\u2019s published works (either literary or non-fiction) or papers, nor was it contemporaneously recorded as something he once said. This quote actually stemmed from a Carroll-inspired character who appeared in a modern television series.\n\n\u201cOnce Upon a Time,\u201d which originally aired on ABC from 2011 to 2018, was a fantasy series about \u201ca young woman [who] is drawn to a small Maine town and discovers that it\u2019s filled with elements of the fairy tale world.\u201d One of the characters who popped up in that series, Jefferson, was clearly based on Carroll\u2019s famous Mad Hatter (from his \u201cAlice\u201d books), and in the episode \u201cHat Trick\u201d (S1E17, original airdate March 25, 2012), Jefferson delivered the line in question during a debate with Emma Swan about the difference between reality and imagination:", "lang": "en"}
