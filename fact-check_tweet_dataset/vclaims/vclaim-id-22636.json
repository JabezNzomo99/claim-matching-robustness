The road show made headlines after violence erupted between BJP workers and members of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) party. The clashes resulted in the bust of Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar being desecrated with both parties blaming each other for the same.\n\nThe violence and clashes led to the Election Commission cutting short campaigning for the last round of voting in West Bengal. The EC applied Article 324 of the Constitution which allows for \"superintendence, direction and control of elections\".\n\nThe video was shared on a Facebook group Trinamool Cyber Combat Force (TCCF) with a caption in Bengali which translates to, \"Result of demolishing Vidyasagar's statue. Serves him right. The government will see a downfall from May 23 onwards.\" (Bengali text :\u09ac\u09bf\u09a6\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09b8\u09be\u0997\u09b0\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ae\u09c1\u09b0\u09cd\u09a4\u09bf \u09ad\u09be\u0999\u09be\u09b0 \u09ab\u09b2! \u09a0\u09c7\u09b2\u09be \u09ac\u09c1\u099d\u09cd! \u09e8\u09e9 \u09ae\u09c7 \u0986\u09b8\u09a4\u09c7 \u09a8\u09be \u0986\u09b8\u09a4\u09c7\u0987 \u09b8\u09b0\u0995\u09be\u09b0\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09a4\u09a8 \u09b6\u09c1\u09b0\u09c1 \u09f7)\n\nThe video is viral on Facebook with the same caption in Bengali\n\nBOOM searched for the key words 'Amit Shah Falling From Vehicle' and found results for news stories from 2018.
