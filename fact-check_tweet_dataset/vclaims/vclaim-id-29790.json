It did not say it was moving production to Detroit instead, as President Trump claimed.\n\n\u201cThat was not part of the announcement,\u201d GM spokesman Patrick Morrissey said in a phone interview with FactCheck.org.\n\nA GM Korea press release announcing the closure said that the Gunsan plant has been underused for years, \u201cmaking continued operations unsustainable.\u201d But the press release also said the company presented stakeholders with \u201ca concrete plan to stay in the country and turn the business around\u201d to save jobs.\n\nHowever, during a meeting on trade held at the White House with the president\u2019s cabinet and some members of Congress, Trump said that the company was relocating.\n\nTrump, Feb. 13: One thing I just \u2014 I do want to tell you, we just got this notice. General Motors in Korea announces the first step in necessary restructuring. They\u2019re going to \u2014 GM Korea company announced today that it will cease production and close its Gunsan plant in May of 2018, and they\u2019re going to move back to Detroit. You don\u2019t hear these things, except for the fact that Trump became President. Believe me, you wouldn\u2019t be hearing that. So they\u2019re moving back from Korea to Detroit. They\u2019re moving.\n\nThe president got the closure part right, but there was nothing in the company\u2019s official statement about \u201cmoving back\u201d to the Motor City.\n\n\u201cThere could be broader global implications,\u201d as a result of closing the plant, Morrissey, a GM spokesman, told us by phone. But as for a planned move to Detroit? \u201cThat was not part of the announcement,\u201d he said.\n\nKristin Dziczek, head of the Industry, Labor & Economics Group at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan, was more direct.\n\n\u201cThere is no new plant or new production in Detroit\u201d as a result of this, Dziczek told us in an interview. She tweeted similar statements contradicting the president, who also wrongly said that Fiat Chrysler was moving a manufacturing plant from Mexico to Michigan.\n\nIn its Feb. 12 press release, GM Korea said \u201cit will cease production and close its Gunsan plant by the end of May 2018\u201d because the \u201cfacility has been increasingly underutilized, running at about 20 percent of capacity over the past three years, making continued operations unsustainable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis announcement occurs after a careful review of the company\u2019s operations, which have sustained significant losses for the past several years,\u201d the company said.\n\nDziczek noted that fewer people are buying the Chevy Cruze, which is one of two cars made at the Gunsan plant. So there\u2019s really no need for more capacity in the U.S., where Cruzes are already made in Lordstown, Ohio, she explained.\n\nContrary to Trump\u2019s claim of a move to Detroit, the company will still have three other assembly plants in South Korea. And the company promised to present stakeholders with a \u201cconcrete plan to stay in the country and turn the business around.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe proposal includes significant product-related investments in South Korea and would preserve thousands of jobs,\u201d its press release said.\n\nThe company said that it will make a decision on its next steps by the end of February.", "lang": "en"}
