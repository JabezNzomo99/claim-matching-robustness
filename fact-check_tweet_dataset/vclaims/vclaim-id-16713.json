Among other things, lots of young people leave education and look for a job over the summer.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) says that it can get a better view of unemployment if it works out the size of seasonal changes and adjusts the figures to smooth them out.\n\nAt about 1.6 million, what\u2019s called the \u2018seasonally adjusted\u2019 unemployment count is lower than it\u2019s been since 2006.\n\nIt\u2019s not correct that there are about 600,000 unemployed 18-24 year olds in the UK. It was about that in the summer of 2015, and had been higher before.\n\nAt the most recent count, in July-September 2016, there were about 520,000 18-24 year olds unemployed in the UK.\n\nThe ONS\u2019s 'seasonal adjustment\u2019 reduces this by about a tenth. The seasonally adjusted unemployment count for 18-24 year olds is 473,000.\n\nMr Nuttall seems to be referring to what\u2019s called net migration, rather than immigration. That\u2019s the number of people who came into the UK, minus the number who left.\n\nIn the year leading up to June 2016, it\u2019s estimated that somewhere between 616,000 and 684,000 people came to live into the UK.\n\nIn the same period, somewhere between 294,000 and 336,000 people went to live abroad.\n\nThat means that somewhere between 295,000 and 375,000 more people came into the country than left.\n\nSo the best estimate for annual net migration is about 335,000 at the moment, give or take 40,000 either way.\n\nThat number is actually slightly bigger than the population of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, which is about 293,000. (The number of people who immigrated, ignoring emigrants, is over twice the number of people who live in Newcastle-upon-Tyne.)\n\nThere\u2019s a fair bit of uncertainty in official migration estimates, and some people have questioned how reliable they are. But it seems safe to say that the current level of net migration is high by historic standards.\n\nThe link between immigration and unemployment isn\u2019t simple. Research in the past has suggested that immigration doesn\u2019t significantly affect unemployment overall, although immigration from outside the EU could have a negative impact on the employment of UK-born workers, especially during an economic downturn.\n\nJobs for immigrants shouldn\u2019t automatically mean fewer jobs for people living here already. According to mainstream economic theory, it\u2019s a mistake to assume that there are a fixed number of jobs in the economy. The idea is that that since immigrants spend money, they create jobs too.\n\nWe\u2019ve previously written about the effects of immigration on jobs and wages. It seems to matter what kind of job you have and where you have it.", "lang": "en"}
