The wage bill plus debt repayments together take up 72.4% of tax revenue. \n\n\n\n\n\nRich with comparisons between South Africa and the\n\n, a single-stemmed plant indigenous to Southern Africa, Mboweni announced changes to the February 2020 budget, made necessary by the\n\nIn the new budget, 58 cents out of every R1 paid in tax is used to pay the salaries of public servants,\n\nshadow minister for public service and administration, claimed in a\n\nSchreiber said this wage bill plus debt repayments, which take 22 cents of every rand, made 80% of all tax revenue unavailable for spending on everything from social grants to education, healthcare and infrastructure development.\n\nDo the figures support Schreiber's claim about public pay? We pulled out the balance sheets.\n\nHow much tax is collected?\n\nWhen Africa Check asked Schreiber for the source of his claim, he referred us to a\n\nthat showed the main budget revenue for the 2020/21 financial year would drop from February\u2019s projected R1.398 trillion to R1.099 trillion.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, expenditure on compensation of employees will remain at the R638 billion projected in February 2020,\u201d he said. This is 58% of the R1.099 trillion main budget revenue, or 58 cents out of every R1 in tax.\n\nBut revenue in the main budget comes from a number of sources, including non-tax revenue, the\n\ntold Africa Check. To calculate how much tax money goes towards paying public servants, it is better to look at gross tax revenue \u2013 the total amount of tax collected by the government.\n\nGross tax revenue was pared back to R1.121 trillion, the treasury said, although this was not published in the supplementary budget review. In February, the government expected to collect\n\nin tax. It is now anticipating\n\nHow much of the gross tax revenue goes towards paying public servants?\n\nOut of every R1 in tax, 51.4 cents for public servants\n\non public servant salaries, Schreiber told Africa Check, as shown in a table of expenditure by economic classification in the\n\nBut this table includes all entities of government, some of which collect taxes, treasury said. For example, the\n\ncollects tax in the form of toll fees. But exactly how much tax this entity and others will collect will only become clearer in October when the medium term budget policy statement is published.\n\nIn the meantime, in order to compare apples with apples, a more appropriate measure would be the \u201cconsolidated national, provincial and social security funds\u201d found in the\n\nof the February budget, the treasury said. This provides a more detailed breakdown.\n\nThe breakdown estimates the government will spend\n\non paying public servants in the 2020/21 financial year. This is 51.4% of gross tax revenue (R1.121 trillion), or 51.4 cents of every R1 paid in taxes.\n\nWithout the projected R304.1 billion loss in tax revenue, this figure would have been 40%, or 40 cents out of every R1 paid in taxes.\n\nThe public servant wage bill dropped by just R519 million in the June 2020 supplementary budget. The saving was mainly due to vacancies not being filled and funds being suspended for Covid-19 purposes. \u201cFurther adjustments may be considered in October,\u201d the treasury said.\n\nWhile the budget for public servants salaries remained largely the same, debt repayments were projected to increase to\n\nin 2020/21. This is 21% of gross tax revenue (R1.121 trillion) or 21 cents of every R1 in taxes.\n\nSince February, the amount South Africa has to borrow for the 2020/21 financial year has grown from\n\n. The money will come from short and long-term loans from local lenders, and from foreign-currency loans.\n\nThe increase is almost entirely due to the projected shortfall in tax revenue, Daniel McLaren, budget analyst for the\n\n, told Africa Check. \u201cA similar increase is being experienced in every country in the world, as they too battle the economic fallout from Covid-19,\u201d he said.\n\nThe higher debt repayments were increasingly crowding out the government\u2019s spending plans, the treasury told Africa Check.\n\nConclusion: In revised budget, 51.4 cents out of every R1 in tax revenue goes to public servant salaries.\n\nLeon Schreiber, Democratic Alliance shadow minister for public service and administration, recently claimed that out of every R1 paid in tax, 58 cents goes towards paying South Africa\u2019s public servants.\n\nThe national treasury told Africa Check that it aims to collect R1.121 trillion in tax during the 2020/21 financial year and R576 billion of that will go towards paying public servants.\n\nThis is 51.4 cents out of every R1 paid in tax. The extra 7 cents represents R80 billion in tax revenue that has been allocated elsewhere, the treasury said.\n\nPublic servant salaries and increased debt repayments, which cost 21 cents in every rand, together take up 72.4% of South Africa\u2019s gross tax revenue \u2013 leaving 27.6% for everything else.\n\nWe rate this claim as mostly correct.", "lang": "en"}
