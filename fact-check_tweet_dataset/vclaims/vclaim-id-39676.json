In an interview on ABC radio on September 30, Mr Leigh said that \u201cAustralians spend twice as much on superannuation fees as we do on electricity - some $30 billion a year.\u201d [1]\n\nAAP FactCheck has examined Mr Leigh\u2019s claim that Australians spend twice as much on superannuation fees as electricity.\n\nMr Leigh\u2019s office told AAP FactCheck his statement was based on a report by the Productivity Commission - a federal government research and advisory body - from December 2018. [2] [3]\n\nThis report titled, Superannuation: Assessing Efficiency and Competitiveness, states \u201cAustralians pay over $30 billion a year in fees on their super (excluding insurance premiums).\u201d [3]\n\nThe Productivity Commission said the estimated figure was consistent with a 2018 study by financial services information company Rainmaker Group which found Australians paid up to $32 billion a year in super fees. [4]\n\nThe Rainmaker study analysed more than 2500 fee options offered by 550 superannuation products representing 20 million member accounts. [4]\n\nMr Leigh\u2019s office also referred AAP FactCheck to a tweet by Australian National University (ANU) economist Ben Phillips, who on Monday said: \u201cReminder Oz households spend twice as much on superannuation fees as we do on electricity\u201d. [5] [6]\n\nRegarding electricity costs, Mr Leigh\u2019s office told AAP FactCheck that Australian households\u2019 total expenditure on power was $14 billion in 2015-16. A spokesperson for Mr Leigh said the figure was sourced from the 2015-16 Household Expenditure Survey produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. [7]\n\nMr Phillips said he used ABS data from the 2015-16 Household Expenditure Survey to estimate $13.88 billion was spent by Australians on electricity per year.\n\n\u201cRoughly speaking, we spend about twice as much on super fees as we do on electricity for the family home,\u201d he told AAP FactCheck.\n\nAn ABS spokesperson also provided calculations how a figure of about $14 billion in annual electricity costs can be reached. Average household weekly expenditure on electricity was $29.81, according to the Household Expenditure Survey, and with 8,959,600 households in Australia the total yearly expenditure comes to $13.926 billion.\n\nIt is worth noting that the $30 billion estimate of superannuation fees has not gone unchallenged. Actuarial consulting group RiceWarner has disputed the figure, claiming the actual number is lower at just over $22 billion in an article titled \u2018Fees versus value\u2019, published on August 16, 2018. [8] [9]\n\nRiceWarner\u2019s Superannuation Fees Analysis 2018 found Australians spent $22.4 billion on superannuation fees for the year ended June 30, 2017. The group\u2019s analysis also found there had been a 27 per cent fee reduction over 15 years. \u201cThe whole industry is run at a cost less than the combined annual profits of the four big banks,\u201d the report said.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claim Australians spend twice as much on superannuation fees as they do on electricity to be true.", "lang": "en"}
