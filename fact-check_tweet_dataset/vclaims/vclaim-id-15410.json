It is completely false.\n\nFor starters, the picture accompanying the post is not a picture of Mr Malik. It\u2019s a picture of Chuka Umunna, the MP for Streatham and a member of the Independent Group of MPs (who left the Labour Party in February 2019).\n\nSecondly, Mr Malik never said those words. Following the YouTube link in the post leads to an edited video of Mr Malik at the Global Peace and Unity event in 2008, not a \u201cMuslim Council meeting [in] 2014\u201d as the post suggests.\n\nThe full video is available here, during which Mr Malik says:\n\n\u201cIn 1997 we got our first Muslim MP, in 2001 we had two Muslim MPs, in 2005 we had four Muslim MPs. Inshallah [God willing] in 2009/10 we\u2019ll have eight Muslim MPs. In 2014 we\u2019ll have 16 Muslim MPs.\n\n\u201cAt this rate the whole parliament will be Muslim. But just to say, in case there are journalists here today, that is not my objective.\n\n\u201cBut you know we\u2019ve got four Muslim MPs. There should be 20 Muslim MPs in parliament and inshallah very shortly we\u2019ll see that.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m confident as Britain\u2019s first Muslim minister that, inshallah, in the next 30 years or so we\u2019ll see a prime minister in this country who happens to share my faith.\u201d\n\nAt no point does he mention Sharia law, or say anything about replacing British or Christian culture with Sharia law.\n\nIn 2006 Mr Malik wrote a piece about Sharia law in the Sunday Times headlined \u201cIf you want sharia law, you should go and live in Saudi.\u201d\n\nFinally the post describes Mr Malik as \u201cLabours [sic] Alien and Justice Minister.\u201d Mr Malik was a junior minister in the justice department though the role of \u201cAlien and Justice Minister\u201d is made up.", "lang": "en"}
