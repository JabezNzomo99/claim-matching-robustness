It juxtaposes quotes from Trump with a graph that traces the exponential growth of coronavirus cases.\n\nThe ad drew sharp criticism from the Trump campaign, which sent a cease and desist letter to TV stations calling the ad \"patently false, misleading, and deceptive.\"\n\nThe ad charts the rise in coronavirus cases in the U.S. from Jan. 20 to March 22. It ends with a clip of Trump from a March 13 White House press conference, saying, \"No, I don\u2019t take responsibility at all.\" The Trump quotes featured in the ad are all real.\n\nBut the campaign\u2019s letter to TV stations says the ad \"stitched together fragments from multiple speeches\" to give the impression that Trump called the coronavirus a \"hoax.\"\n\nPriorities USA responded by expanding their ad buy, throwing another $600,000 dollars behind its initial $6 million investment, according to a press release. Priorities USA spokesman Josh Schwerin told us the organization stands by the facts in the ad.\n\nOverall, the ad splices together many audio clips that were clearly made at different times. The clips don\u2019t necessarily align with the rise in cases that the ad shows. We\u2019ll take you through the ad.\n\nTrump\u2019s \"hoax\" comment came during a Feb. 28 campaign rally in North Charleston, S.C. Trump\u2019s comments at the rally are not particularly clear.\n\nAfter accusing Democrats of \"politicizing the coronavirus,\" Trump criticized the 2016 Russia investigation and his impeachment in the House before turning back to the virus.\n\n\"Think of it,\" he said. \"And this is their new hoax.\"\n\nThe following day, a reporter asked what he meant. Trump said he was referring not to COVID-19, but to \"the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m not talking about what\u2019s happening here; I\u2019m talking about what they\u2019re doing. That\u2019s the hoax,\" Trump said, fueling the unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that Democrats and the media have exaggerated the threat of the coronavirus to hurt his reelection chances.\n\nWhen former Vice President Joe Biden ran a similar ad that appeared to show Trump calling the coronavirus a hoax, we rated it False because the ad spliced and edited the video to make Trump\u2019s comments seem more clear than they actually were. (Read Trump\u2019s full remarks here.)\n\nThe Priorities USA ad uses a brief clip from Trump\u2019s comments to suggest he was saying the coronavirus itself is a hoax. That\u2019s up for interpretation.\n\nIn the ad, the \"hoax\" comment is heard and displayed on screen while the graph shows U.S. coronavirus cases ticking from one case to five cases.\n\nIn reality, the comment came later, when there were 59 U.S. cases, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThis comment came during a Jan. 22 interview with CNBC\u2019s Joe Kernen.\n\nKernen asked whether Trump had been briefed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and whether there were worries about the coronavirus spiraling into a pandemic.\n\n\"No, not at all,\" Trump said. \"We have it totally under control. It\u2019s one person coming in from China. And we have it under control. It\u2019s going to be just fine.\"\n\nThe quote is featured in the Priorities USA ad while the graph of U.S. coronavirus cases moves from five cases to eight cases.\n\nIn reality, the CDC had just announced the detection of the first U.S. case in Washington state on Jan. 21. That person had just traveled to Wuhan, China, where the disease was first identified.\n\nThis quote came during a meeting with black leaders on Feb. 27. Flanked by commentators Rochelle Richardson and Terrence Williams, Trump heralded his administration efforts.\n\n\"We have done an incredible job,\" he said. \"We\u2019re going to continue. It\u2019s going to disappear. One day, it\u2019s like a miracle, it will disappear. And from our shores, it could get worse before it gets better. It could maybe go away. We\u2019ll see what happens. Nobody really knows.\"\n\n\"It will all work out,\" Trump continued, adding that the low numbers in the U.S. \u2014 he said there were 15 cases, although the actual number was closer to 60 \u2014 were reflective of a \"miracle.\"\n\nThe Priorities USA ad highlights this quote while the graph shows cases in the U.S. rising from nine cases to 11 cases. But again, there were really some 59 confirmed cases by then.\n\nThese remarks came during a Feb. 26 press conference, when Trump contradicted warnings from top health officials by insisting that the spread of the coronavirus through the U.S. was not \"inevitable\" and claiming the number of U.S. cases was \"going very substantially down.\"\n\nTrump repeatedly claimed that there were then only 15 Americans with the virus, even though the WHO and CDC had counted closer to 60. He seemed to be referring to people diagnosed in the United States, while leaving out those who had been repatriated with the virus from abroad.\n\nThe Priorities USA ad features these comments while the graph depicting U.S. cases spikes to more than 5,000 \u2014 far more than what the CDC and WHO had recorded by then.\n\nTrump made this remark during a March 7 visit to the CDC\u2019s headquarters in Atlanta.\n\nThe visit came one day after Trump wrongly claimed that anyone could get a diagnostic test for the coronavirus.\n\nIn the Priorities USA ad, the comment comes as the graph shows U.S. coronavirus cases skyrocketing over 30,000 and off the grid.\n\nBut the CDC and the independent COVID Tracking Project show that the number of U.S. cases eclipsed 30,000 on March 22. On March 7, the number of known cases was closer to 300.\n\nA final note: U.S. cases really took off after the calendar flipped to March, according to the CDC and COVID Tracking Project.\n\nBy then, Trump\u2019s rhetoric toward the coronavirus had shifted. On Twitter and in an address to the nation, he continued celebrating his response, but he also encouraged elderly populations to be \"very careful\" and urged all Americans to practice good hygiene.\n\nHe declared a national emergency on March 13. Days later, he said the U.S. was in a \"big war.\"", "lang": "en"}
