The latest duel is between Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) leader Asaduddin Owaisi.\n\nYogi Adityanath on Sunday in an election campaign in Vikarabad, Telangana, warned Owaisi by saying, \"If BJP comes to power, I assure you Owaisi will have to flee from Telangana the same way Nizam was forced to flee from Hyderabad.\"\n\nOwaisi slammed Yogi saying, \"He (yogi) has zero knowledge in history Nizam never fled from Hyderabad.\"\n\nThis triggered a hot debate on social media over the Hyderabad Nizam, many pointed out that Yogi's claim was \"wrong\".\n\nIndia Today Fact Check found the seventh and the last Nizam of Hyderabad had surrendered to Indian forces but never fled from Hyderabad, as claimed by Yogi Adityanath.\n\nAfter independence in 1947, Hyderabad was one among other independent princely states. The seventh Nizam of Hyderabad, Mir Osman Ali Khan chose neither to accede to India nor Pakistan but to remain independent.\n\nHe tried to remain independent by maintaining a status-quo with the Indian government. But the internal situation in Hyderabad deteriorated with various political upsurges forcing the Nizam to join the Indian union.\n\nThe loyal forces of Nizam called \"the Razakars\" tried to contain these political movements against the Nizam by force but it resulted in more communal unrest in the princely state.\n\nAs all efforts by the Indian government to persuade the Nizam to accede to the dominion failed, India decided to send troops to Hyderabad on September 13, 1948.\n\nThe name of this military operation to annex Hyderabad with India was called \"Operation Polo\". The Nizam surrendered in four days, and the Government of India appointed Major-General JN Chaudhuri as Military Governor.\n\nAccording to a researcher of International history in London School of Economics and Political Science, Dr Taylor C Sherman, \"Delhi decided that the Nizam could retain his position as Rajpramukh, though law-making and enforcement power rested with the Military Governor.\"\n\nRajpramukhs were appointed Governors of certain provinces and states in India. The sequence of events can be read in Dr Sherman's detailed research on the accession of Hyderabad. The paper is called - \"The integration of the princely state of Hyderabad and the making of the postcolonial state in India, 1948-56\".\n\nThese same facts are also confirmed by scholar historian professor Arjun Rao Kuthadi - the head of the history department of Osmania University, Hyderabad.\n\nProfessor Kuthadi clarified, \"Though the Nizam initially refused to join Indian union but later chose to do so after India's military action, he surrendered but never fled from Hyderabad even after the police action.\"\n\nThe historic records of \"The Hyderabad Police Action\" has been documented by the Indian Army as well.\n\nBut nowhere is it found that the last Nizam of Hyderabad, Mir Osman Ali Khan had ever fled Hyderabad.\n\nThe Nizam remained the Rajpramukh of the State from 26 January 1950 until 31 October 1956, when the post was abolished.\n\nMir Osman Ali Khan died on 24 February 1967, which was a Friday. But unlike other Nizams, the last Nizam was buried beside his mother, in the graveyard of Judi Mosque facing King Kothi Palace, Hyderabad.\n\nOnce named as the richest man in the world by Time magazine, the seventh Nizam is also known as the architect of modern Hyderabad.\n\nAlso read: Owaisi will flee Hyderabad like Nizam did if BJP comes to power in Telangana: Yogi\n\nAlso read: Modi isn't god, criticising him is constitutional right: Owaisi tells Adityanath", "lang": "en"}
