Hundreds of demonstrators were detained.\n\nThe Kremlin rejected calls by the European Union and United States to free the protesters, saying the demonstrations were \u201cillegal\u201d and the young people who made up a majority of the protesters were \u201cpaid\u201d by the opposition to participate.\n\nOn Tuesday, the liberal Ekho Moskvy (Echo of Moscow) radio station reported that the detained protesters were being tortured and mistreated while in police custody.\n\nSunday\u2019s protests instantly became trending on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, with thousands of people posting pictures and videos of the protests and the mass arrests that followed.\n\nRussia\u2019s state-controlled TV channels largely ignored the protests, and responded to criticism by saying the protests were not \u201csignificant enough\u201d to be covered.\n\nLike other Kremlin-controlled media, Sputnik ignored Sunday's demonstrations, posting its first and only report following the arrest of protest leader Alexei Navalny. That report focused on the fact that the protests were \u201cunlicensed\u201d \u2013 meaning they were not officially authorized.\n\nOn Monday, Sputnik followed up with a report that quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov accusing protest organizers of having \u201cmisled minors\u201d by promising them monetary \u201crewards\u201d to join the demonstrations.\n\nKevin Rothrock, Russia editor for Global Voices, a non-profit that analyzes international media, told Polygraph.info that it was inappropriate for Sputnik's Margarita Simonyan to compare crowd sizes for Russian protests to those in Western countries.\n\n\"Simonyan\u2019s basic claim seems to be that Sunday\u2019s rallies were relatively small, compared to the mass demonstrations that we regularly see in the West,\" he said. \"That\u2019s true, but it\u2019s because it\u2019s much easier to protest in the West, where you either don\u2019t need a permit or it\u2019s fairly easy to get one. The Russians who turned out on Sunday knew they were risking arrest, which is something most Western demonstrators don\u2019t expect.\"\n\nRothrock added that Western media did not expect the turnout at Sunday's protests to be so large or the police response to be so harsh.\n\n\"Simonyan\u2019s accusation that the Western media 'planned' to 'overhype' these rallies isn\u2019t supported by the reporting leading up to Sunday,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, Edward Lucas, a senior editor at The Economist, said he thought the Western media coverage of the demonstrations was \u201ca bit over-optimistic.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's a surprise seeing that the opposition isn't dead, but this is way smaller than Bolotnaya (the 2011-2012 protests) and there is no sign so far of blue-collar involvement,\u201d he said.", "lang": "en"}
