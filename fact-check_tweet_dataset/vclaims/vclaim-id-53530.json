After she suffered a heart attack on the morning of May 1, 2019, she was taken to Ahmedabad Civil hospital, where she was declared dead at the hospital.\n\nOur investigation proves that Bhagwatiben Modi passed away a year before these posts started doing the rounds on the internet.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
