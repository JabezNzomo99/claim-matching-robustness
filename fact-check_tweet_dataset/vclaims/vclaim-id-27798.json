It was shared on November 27, 2019.\n\nThe same video was earlier viral earlier in February 2019 and was massively circulated.\n\nIn fact, Alt News found that this video along with this claim had been posted by a right-wing Facebook page Azaad Bharat in November 2018, and the share count exceeded 9,000.\n\nWhat is the truth of the video?\n\nA simple search on Google with the keywords \u2018mosque bhajan\u2019 reveals a YouTube video of ABP News, which had fact-checked this claim twice on its \u2018Viral Sach\u2019 programme, first in August 2016 and later in February 2018. This suggests that this claim has been circulating on social media for at least four years or more. The same had been fact-checked by The Quint.\n\nThe video is not from a mosque in Dubai as claimed, but from Prasanthi Nilayam, the ashram of spiritual guru Sathya Sai Baba at Puttaparthi in Andhra Pradesh. The event which took place in 2012 was attended by devotees from Bahrain, Iran, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, according to a July 2013 report by Colombo Telegraph titled \u201cSai Baba\u2019s Arabic-Islamic Flavour\u201d. The entire video of the cultural event is posted below.\n\nIn conclusion, the video of burqa-clad women singing bhajans is not from a mosque in Dubai, but from a cultural event organised at Sathya Sai Baba\u2019s ashram in Puttaparthi, Andhra Pradesh.", "lang": "en"}
