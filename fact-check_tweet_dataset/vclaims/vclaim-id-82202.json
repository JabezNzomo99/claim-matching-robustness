This is an estimate, based on a relatively rich data set of more than 30,000 medical records. There is some uncertainty about the estimate, so Obama\u2019s statement could have been more precisely worded, but overall we determined the claim was worthy of the elusive Geppetto Checkmark.\n\n2: Rand Paul\u2019s claim that Reagan\u2019s tax cuts produced \u2018more revenue\u2019 and \u2018tens of millions of jobs\u2019\n\nThe Kentucky Republican asserted that even though President Ronald Reagan cut taxes, more tax revenue was generated. But it turns out that the senator was relying on an estimate that credited revenue from Reagan\u2019s tax increases in 1982, 1983, 1984 and 1987 that were designed to recover revenue lost because the big 1981 tax cut. White House budget documents and even Reagan\u2019s own 1990 budget clearly show that the 1981 tax cut reduced revenue. So this was a Three-Pinocchio claim.\n\nHere, we delved into whether, under Canadian law, charities are prohibited from disclosing individual donors without prior permission, as claimed by the Clinton Foundation. The issue is highly complex, but we determined that the federal law does not explicitly ban charities from disclosing individual donor names without permission. In fact, it applies only to commercial use of personal information; the public release of donor names for a non-commercial purpose is not prohibited. The Clinton Foundation earned Three Pinocchios.\n\n4: Nope, Jon Stewart, $1 trillion wasn\u2019t spent on Afghanistan schools at the expense of Baltimore\n\nSome readers thought we had lost our sense of humor, but it was for a good cause \u2014 perpetual misunderstanding about the size of the U.S. foreign aid budget. As we documented, far more federal taxpayer dollars were spent on Baltimore schools than on schools in Afghanistan. So Stewart earned Four Pinocchios.\n\n5: The zombie claim about Navy ship numbers returns to the 2016 campaign trail\n\nGOP presidential hopefuls revived a talking point that The Fact Checker had debunked during the 2012 presidential campaign \u2014 that the Navy will be the smallest size since World War I. This is a simple-minded ship-counting comparison that makes little sense, as the gunboats of 1915 and aircraft carriers of 2015 are simply not comparable. So it is worthy of Three Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
