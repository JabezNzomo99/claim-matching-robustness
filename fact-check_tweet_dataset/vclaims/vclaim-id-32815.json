It\u2019s like a strong flu.\u201d\n\nBaete noted fears about a lack of medical supplies when the sick show up at hospitals. \u201cThe issue is really that people do not know what to do, and we are behaving in a really disorganized way,\u201d he said.\n\nBaete\u2019s claim that COVID-19 is \u201clike a strong flu\u201d can be viewed in two ways, however. On the one hand, there are many similarities in symptoms and the way the flu and coronavirus are is spread.\n\nOn the other hand, the flu is blamed for as many as 61,000 deaths in the United States alone each year, so the comparison hardly minimizes the potential dangers of COVID-19.\n\n(The virus that causes COVID-19 has been identified as SARS-CoV-2 or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2).\n\nIndeed, as coronavirus cases continue to emerge globally, scientists are urgently studying its characteristics, but it may be too soon to draw conclusions about fatality rates, transmission and who is most vulnerable to infection or complications.\n\n\u201cThere are so many huge unknowns about this outbreak,\u201d said Professor Mark Woolhouse of Edinburgh University told The Guardian this month. \u201cFor example, we don\u2019t know just how infectious people are before they show symptoms. That makes it impossible to predict what is going to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe trouble is, this outbreak is caused by a very different virus. And unlike flu, there are no vaccines or treatments and, crucially, no pre-existing immunity in the population.\u201d\n\nBaete joins the ranks of those who\u2019ve voiced concern about overreacting to the virus and the potential damage to the world economy. They include Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund.\n\n\u201cWhile we are focused on the coronavirus, we don\u2019t want to see attention derailed from other very important issues for the stability and prosperity of the world economy,\u201d she said earlier this week.\n\nMost prominently, there is U.S. President Donald Trump, who boasted in a Tweet that that the coronavirus \u201cis very much under control in the USA\u201d and blamed news media for \u201cdoing everything possible to make the Coronavirus look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible.\u201d\n\nThen on Wednesday, Trump held a news conference where, flanked by U.S. health officials, he put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the country\u2019s coronavirus response effort \u2013 while proclaiming \u201ctremendous success\u201d so far in preventing an outbreak.\n\nHe downplayed the stock market drop, assigning responsibility in part to his Democratic political opponents, and also compared COVID-19 to the flu.\n\n\u201cOver the last 10 years, we\u2019ve lost 360,000. These are people that have died from the flu, from what we call the flu,\u201d Trump said.\n\nCOVID-19, he said, \"\u2026[i]t's a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for. And we'll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner.\"\n\nHealth officials have published comparisons between the two diseases based on preliminary data on COVID-19.\n\nSimilarities include symptoms ranging from fever, cough, body aches, to fatigue and diarrhea. Both diseases can vary in intensity from mild to severe to fatal, can result in pneumonia and are spread through droplets in the air from coughing, talking or sneezing.\n\nOne difference is that the flu is caused by a variety of different viruses. Another is that COVID-19 may spread through what\u2019s called the airborne route \u2013 when droplets in the air infect people even if the ill person has left. Vaccinations are available for the flu and are successful in reducing the severity of illness. Vaccine is under development for COVID-19.\n\nThe latest reports show 82,549 confirmed infections worldwide with 2,810 deaths and 33,252 recoveries.", "lang": "en"}
