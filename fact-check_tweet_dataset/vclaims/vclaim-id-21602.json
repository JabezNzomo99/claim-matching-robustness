We\u2019ve asked Unite if that was the basis for Mr McClusky\u2019s claim.\n\nThe tax gap is the difference between what HMRC collects and what it thinks it\u2019s owed in theory.\n\nThe overall tax gap includes things other than evasion and avoidance. It counts an estimated \u00a34.8 billion lost to criminal activity (such as smuggling), \u00a36.2 billion uncollected from the hidden economy (which includes things like undeclared cash-in-hand jobs), or \u00a33.2 billion in honest mistakes.\n\nArguably, it\u2019s fair to use \u201ctax evasion and avoidance\u201d as shorthand for all these activities when the phrase \u201ctax gap\u201d might be met with blank faces.\n\nBut HMRC\u2019s estimates don\u2019t justify the claim that all \u00a340 billion of these losses came from \u201cthe super rich and corporate elite\u201d.\n\nOnly \u00a39.5 billion was lost to large non-illegal businesses, according to HMRC. Another \u00a33.4 billion was lost to individuals, not all of whom will be \u201csuper-rich\u201d. It estimates that half the tax gap was down to small and medium sized businesses.\n\nHMRC doesn\u2019t know exactly how much tax it\u2019s missing out on each year. Some parts of the estimate come with a lot of uncertainty and \u201can element of judgement is used\u201d, as HMRC puts it.\n\nFor example, HMRC thinks it may have lost anywhere between \u00a3300 million and \u00a31.4 billion in cigarette taxes last year. That\u2019s quite a big range of possibility.\n\nHMRC\u2019s also aren\u2019t the only estimates. The academic Richard Murphy thinks its figure is a very big underestimate, and questions the way it categorises some activities.", "lang": "en"}
