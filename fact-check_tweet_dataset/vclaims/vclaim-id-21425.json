The video is being shared on social media with the claim that it depicts a protest against the Modi government in the wake of rising religious discrimination in the country. The caption, along with the video tweeted by a user, reads, \u201cPeople have taken rally to show to Modi government, that all religions people are the citizens of this country, no discrimination will be accepted.\u201d. The tweet has garnered more than 1000 retweets so far.\n\nA few other individuals on Twitter and Facebook have shared the video with a similar narrative.\n\nAlso shared with a claim of protest for Kashmir\n\nFacebook user Enam Qureshi posted the same video with the caption, \u201c#Save Kashmir\u201d, suggesting that it was a protest against the government\u2019s move to revoke the provisions of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution. The post has garnered over 18,000 shares.\n\nAlt News found that protest shown in the video did take place in Nagpur but it has nothing to do an agitation against religious discrimination or Kashmir. It actually depicts a rally organised on August 25, 2019, and carried out by activists and supporters of \u2018Save Merit Save Nation\u2019 forum to stage a protest against the state government\u2019s reservation policy. The SMSN movement began as a protest against the Maharastra government\u2019s policy to exceed the limit of reservation in education and jobs. \u201cThousands of men, women, youngsters and children representing general (unreserved) category communities on Sunday opposed the state government\u2019s policy to exceed limit of reservation in education and jobs up to 74% against the ceiling of 50% fixed by the Supreme court\u201d, stated a Times of India report published on August 26, 2019.\n\nYou can see a video of the rally posted by Twitter handle of Save Merit Save Nation.\n\nA video report of the same protest by Awaaz India TV can be seen posted below.\n\nIn conclusion, a video of a rally held against the reservation policy of the Maharastra government in Nagpur was shared with two separate false claims. While the first asserted that the people were protesting against the rise of religious discrimination in the country under the NDA regime, the second claimed that it was a protest against unrest in Kashmir.", "lang": "en"}
