While he observed that the burning of fossil fuels might contribute to this effect, he actually thought that might be beneficial because it would stimulate plant growth and thus provide more food.\n\nSeparately, in the mid-1970s, scientists confirmed a theory offered in the 1930s by a Serbian scientist, Milutin Milankovic, that ice age cycles were related to changes of orientation of the Earth relative to the sun. (The cycles occurred at the intervals of 23,000, 42,000 and 100,000 years.) Other scientists using deep-sea sediment cores confirmed that the peak of the last \u201cinterglacial\u201d (the last time that the world was like it is now) was 120,000 years ago and the warmest part lasted about 10,000 years before getting cooler.\n\nThus, since it had been 10,000 years since the last ice age ended, some scientists began to speculate that another ice age could be coming \u2014 sometime in the next thousand years. (Note that Huckabee colorfully suggested that \u201cif we didn\u2019t do something by 1980, we\u2019d be popsicles.\u201d)\n\nSo now the stage was set for some speculative journalism. There had been a period of cold winters in the early 1970s, and so some reporters put two and two together \u2014 and came up with five.\n\nNewsweek, in 1975, ran an article titled \u201cThe Cooling World,\u201d which said: \u201cMeteorologists disagree about the cause and extent of the cooling trend\u2026. But they are almost unanimous in the view that the trend will reduce agricultural productivity for the rest of the century.\u201d Newsweek suggested that one solution was \u201cmelting the arctic ice cap by covering it with black soot.\u201d\n\nIn any case, the science was still unsettled at the time, which allowed reporters to pick and choose the angle to emphasize. Walter Sullivan, the legendary science reporter of the New York Times, published two contradictory articles within a three-month period in 1975. First: \u201cScientists ask why world climate is changing; major cooling may be ahead.\u201d Second: \u201cWarming trend seen in climate; two articles counter view that cold period is due.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, several scientists decided to go back and review the peer-reviewed literature at the time. Despite the media coverage highlighted by Huckabee, it turns out that peer-reviewed articles on global cooling were in a distinct minority compared to those concerned with global warming. \u201cThe survey identified only seven articles indicating cooling compared to 42 indicating warming. Those seven cooling articles garnered just 12% of the citations,\u201d the researchers reported.\n\nThis explains why the \u201cnew ice age\u201d boomlet petered out fairly quickly. \u201cScience represents an accumulation of knowledge, so incorrect hypotheses become exposed,\u201d especially over a 40-year period, said Reed Scherer, associate director of the Institute for the Study of the Environment, Sustainability and Energy at Northern Illinois University. \u201cThe current consensus regarding global warming builds on all scientific studies to date.\u201d\n\nIn fact, in 2006, Newsweek admitted it had been \u201cspectacularly wrong\u201d in publishing the article. \u201cEven by the time it appeared, a decades-long trend toward slightly cooler temperatures in the Northern hemisphere had already begun to reverse itself \u2014 although that wouldn\u2019t be apparent in the data for a few years yet \u2014 leading to today\u2019s widespread consensus among scientists that the real threat is actually human-caused global warming,\u201d the magazine reported.\n\nHuckabee is grasping at incorrect media reporting in order to make a ridiculous point. The main scientific consensus at the time of the Time and Newsweek articles was that the world was entering a period of global warming, as a result of man-made effects, that would overcome any possible cyclical cooling. Indeed, the science of that issue is even more settled now, which is why Newsweek 30 years later conceded it had been wrong.", "lang": "en"}
