However, that lawsuit was about a records request and compliance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) related to Clinton\u2019s use of a private email account and server during her time as secretary of state \u2014 it had nothing to do with the 2012 attack in Benghazi, was not a \u201ctrial,\u201d and did not involve any appearance by Clinton herself in court.\n\nA House Select Committee extensively investigated the 2012 attack that left four Americans dead in Libya and issued a lengthy report that found no wrongdoing on the part of Clinton in connection with that event:\n\nEnding one of the longest, costliest and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history, the House Select Committee on Benghazi issued its final report, finding no new evidence of culpability or wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton in the 2012 attacks in Libya that left four Americans dead. The 800-page report delivered a broad rebuke of the Defense Department, the Central Intelligence Agency and the State Department \u2014 and the officials who led them \u2014 for failing to grasp the acute security risks in Benghazi, and especially for maintaining outposts there that they could not protect. Previous investigations concluded that State Department officials had erred in not better securing the diplomatic compound amid reports of a deteriorating security situation. But they also determined that the attacks had come with little warning and that it would have been difficult to intervene once they had begun.", "lang": "en"}
