Kamala Harris, D-Calif., ripped Rep. Tulsi Gabbard during the Democratic debate in Atlanta, tearing into the Hawaii congresswoman for her comments on Democrats and accusing her of bashing President Barack Obama on Fox News.\n\nThe attack came after Gabbard said the Democratic Party \"is not the party that is of, by and for the people.\" In response, Harris accused Gabbard of being harsh toward Democrats while cozying up to President Donald Trump and his former chief strategist Steve Bannon.\n\n\"I think that it\u2019s unfortunate that we have someone on this stage who is attempting to be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States who during the Obama administration spent four years, full time, on Fox News criticizing President Obama,\" Harris said.\n\nWe decided to dig into the archives and examine Gabbard\u2019s record as a guest on Fox News, a network considered friendly to Trump and his Republican allies.\n\nSaying Gabbard was on Fox \"full time\" seems like an exaggeration, but Gabbard did make frequent appearances on the network during Obama\u2019s second term. And she often bashed the former president\u2019s foreign policy in the process.\n\nAs for Harris, she appeared just once on \"Hannity\" in 2009 to talk about health care while she was San Francisco\u2019s district attorney, we found.\n\nGabbard\u2019s arrival in Congress overlapped with the start of Obama\u2019s second term. From 2013 to 2017, she became a regular guest on Fox News. It\u2019s important to note that Gabbard was appearing as a sitting member of Congress, not as a pundit\n\nSearching the Nexis database, we counted more than 20 appearances Gabbard made on Fox News while Obama was in office. That does not include times when she was mentioned on Fox News or featured in video clips the network\u2019s hosts played on air.\n\nShe was interviewed by a number of current and former Fox News hosts, from anchor Greta Van Susteren to talk show host Tucker Carlson.\n\nGabbard\u2019s anti-war foreign policy views have long put her at odds with members of both parties who believe the United States should have an active hand in resolving international issues.\n\nAs she campaigns for the White House, Gabbard has promised to fight for peace and stay out of what she calls \"regime-change wars\" overseas.\n\nRELATED STORY: Why Tulsi Gabbard calls the war in Syria a \u2018regime change war\u2019\n\nNot surprisingly, her early appearances on Fox News were often critical of the Obama administration\u2019s actions to combat terrorism and manage other issues in the Middle East.\n\nIn a September 2013 interview with Van Susteren, Gabbard said she was against military strikes as Obama was weighing whether to authorize them against the Syrian government.\n\nIn June 2014 and August 2014 interviews on the same show, she shared concerns about Obama\u2019s decisions to send military advisers to Iraq and target the Islamic State with airstrikes.\n\nGabbard ramped up her appearances in 2015, going on Fox News several times to blast Obama over his refusal to refer to the Islamic State\u2019s beliefs and terrorism as \"Islamic extremism\" or \"radical Islam.\"\n\n\"Unless you clearly identify your enemy, then you cannot come up with a very effective strategy to defeat that enemy,\" she told host Neil Cavuto on Jan. 21, 2015.\n\n\"This is not just about words. It's not about semantics,\" she told Van Susteren days later. \"It's really about having a real, true understanding of who our enemy is and how important that is.\"\n\nShe later criticized the administration\u2019s strategy to defeat ISIS, telling Van Susteren that \"the White House needs to change its policy\" and give more support to U.S. allies in the Middle East.\n\nAnd she repeatedly appeared on Fox News to argue that the United States should not work to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, at one point warning that removing Assad would leave Syria as a repeat of \"the failed Libyan state\" she said Obama\u2019s foreign policy helped produce.\n\nGabbard touched on other topics in foreign policy, as well. She weighed in on Israel and the then-ongoing negotiations with Iran over the country\u2019s efforts to build nuclear weapons, which she said should result in a deal that allowed Iranian sites to be inspected without warning.\n\nShe also stepped outside of the foreign policy arena, at one point condemning the Democratic National Committee for allegedly disinviting her from a primary debate in October 2015, while she was the committee\u2019s vice chair, and offering the then-candidates debate advice.\n\nBut even then, her advice to candidates sounded like a swipe against Obama when she said they should answer questions on Syria by speaking out against Turkey\u2019s \"targeting\" of the United States\u2019 Kurdish allies in the region.\n\n\"The fact that the administration has stood silently by and allowed this to happen, including NATO, I think it's important for those candidates on the stage tonight to address this situation and to address how they will approach this and taking action,\" she said.\n\nGabbard has returned to Fox News more than a few times this go-around, joining Carlson and fellow talk show host Sean Hannity to discuss her foreign policy views, the criteria for qualifying for this year\u2019s Democratic debates and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s suggestion that Gabbard is a \"Russian asset.\"", "lang": "en"}
