To preface this claim, the manifesto said that \u201cbetween 1963 and 2013, only 8,200 public primary schools had been connected to electricity\u201d.\n\nof a targeted 23,951, some 22,237 schools now had electricity - an additional 12,080 schools since the electrification plan\n\nin March 2017, Kenyatta said his administration had connected 14,045 schools.

We also could not find independent data to corroborate official numbers. In the absence of this we rate this claim as unproven.\n\nKenya\u2019s installed capacity at the end of June 2013 (the Jubilee administration\u2019s first full financial year begun in July 2013) was 1,765 MW according to the 2013/2014\n\n.

For clean energy, the\n\nthat also counts biomass and solar power.\n\nshows that Kenya\u2019s clean energy mix as 1,496 MW - 818 MW for hydropower, 652 MW for geothermal power and 26 MW for wind.

With its new manifesto, it has revised the ratio it inherited to 1:500.\n\nThe police to population ratio refers to the number of police officers serving a community, relative to its size.\n\nFor example, if a community has 1 police officer serving 100 people, the ratio is 1:100.\n\nas \u201cthose whose principal functions are the prevention, detection and investigation of crime and the apprehension of alleged offenders\u201d.

Some 5,971 regular police officers (i.e excluding administration officers) graduated in March, bringing the total to 59,815 police officers. The ratio falls to 1:759, and not 1:400 as the Jubilee manifesto refers to.\n\nThe claimed ratio is also pegged to an often-cited \u201cUN benchmark of one officer for every 450 citizens\u201d.
