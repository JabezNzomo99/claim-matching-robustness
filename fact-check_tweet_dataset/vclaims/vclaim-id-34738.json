It is the peaceful American way to turn the nation away from a self-defeating course.\u201d\n\nVariations of the quote date back to the early 1900s, according to research by etymologist Barry Popik. \u201cMany times the highest form of civic patriotism lies in criticising your town for all you are worth,\u201d reads one variation that appeared in The Zanesville Signal in 1925.", "lang": "en"}
