Specifically, the study estimated that orders in effect March 8 would have resulted in nearly 36,000 fewer deaths (through May 3), and orders as soon as March 1 would have resulted in nearly 54,000 fewer deaths.\n\nIn the clip above, Biden cited numbers of 45,000 to 60,000. In other venues, he has more correctly said 36,000 lives if orders were in place a week earlier; or 54,000 if two weeks earlier. Or he has said \u201cthousands of lives.\u201d We\u2019re not going to nitpick the numbers. Assuming the study holds up, there\u2019s not much dispute that earlier action on social distancing would have reduced the death toll.\n\nBut we are interested in his claim that President Trump \u201cdid not listen to guys like me back in January saying we have a problem, a pandemic is on the way.\u201d In the interview May 22, Biden said that if \u201che had listened to me and others\u201d and acted sooner, lives would have been saved.\n\nBiden\u2019s reference to January refers to an opinion article he wrote that was published in USA Today on Jan. 27, titled \u201cTrump is worst possible leader to deal with coronavirus outbreak.\u201d The op-ed appeared only days after the Chinese government shut down the city of Wuhan in an effort to stem the crisis, so Biden should be commended for focusing early on an issue that for most Americans was still a distant threat.\n\nAs we have previously noted, the USA Today article is more of an attack on Trump and a recollection of Obama administration steps taken against the 2014 Ebola outbreak than a detailed plan for action against a possible pandemic. But at the same time, Biden indicated that he took the threat seriously, even if he did not explicitly say a pandemic was on the way.\n\nHe referred to the \u201cpossibility of a pandemic\u201d and noted: \u201cThe outbreak of a new coronavirus, which has already infected more than 2,700 people and killed over 80 in China, will get worse before it gets better. Cases have been confirmed in a dozen countries, with at least five in the United States. There will likely be more.\u201d\n\nBiden was asked about the administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus at a CNN town hall Feb. 26. He criticized Trump for not following the advice of health experts to address the issue more quickly because the virus appeared to be spreading through the United States through community transmission. He also knocked Trump for appearing to take at face value China\u2019s assurances that it had the situation under control.\n\n\u201cThere was a virus that occurred in the United States that was spread in the United States, not from someone coming from outside the United States. And so it is a concern and I think it\u2019s important that we understand that you have to have a president in charge,\u201d Biden said, adding: \u201cWe need to invest immediately. We should have done it from the beginning, the moment the virus appeared. But we\u2019re getting late, but we\u2019ve got good scientists. And I just hope the president gets on the same page as the scientists.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. action came about three weeks after Italy, which had halted all flights to and from China on Jan. 31, ordered lockdowns of various Italian towns and cut short the Venice carnival, indicating that the coronavirus was spreading rapidly beyond China. Italy extended emergency measures to the whole country March 10. Social-distancing orders then spread rapidly throughout much of the world.\n\n\u201cStarting in January, Vice President Biden repeatedly called on Donald Trump to take the threat of the coronavirus seriously, and to listen to the advice of scientists and experts in making necessary preparations and combating its spread,\u201d Biden spokesman Michael Gwin said. \u201cTrump ignored Biden\u2019s warnings, and failed to take quick action \u2014 and he refused to listen to public health experts in the administration who pushed for social distancing measures almost a month before they were actually taken. America has paid an unimaginable price because of Trump\u2019s failure to act quickly, with 100,000 dead and the highest unemployment since the Great Depression.\u201d\n\nUnlike Trump, Biden did not have access to the best intelligence about the spread of the virus. Still, from the start, he took the virus seriously. He did not try to sugarcoat the problem, in contrast to Trump. A president sets the tone for a nation and Trump\u2019s insistence that the problem was contained may have misled many Americans into a false sense of security.", "lang": "en"}
