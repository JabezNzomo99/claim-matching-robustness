Let\u2019s try to analyze the authenticity of the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Video of bats found under the tiles of many roofs in Hubei, China. They were the source of Coronavirus. Fact: The video was not taken in China. It\u2019s an old video uploaded on 05 July 2011 by a Miami based roofing company called \u2018Istueta Roofing\u2019. The bats in the video were found under the tiles during the process of replacing a roof for a customer in Miami (US). Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nFrom the \u2018Economic Times\u2019 article, it is learnt that some of the studies suspect that the 2019 novel Coronavirus may have come from bats. But, WHO has officially not yet declared the origin/source of the virus.\n\nUsing the \u2018Invid\u2019 plugin, keyframes of the video were obtained. When these keyframes were reverse image searched using \u2018Yandex\u2019, the same video was found to be uploaded on Youtube by \u2018Istueta Roofing\u2019 on 05 July 2011. According to the description given below the video by the uploader, it is understood that the bats were found in the process of removing tiles from a customer\u2019s old roof in Miami (US) by a roofing company called \u2018Istueta Roofing\u2019, which offers services for roofing needs in South Florida. So, this is not a video from China as mentioned in the post. More information about \u2018Istueta Roofing\u2019 can be found here. \n\n\n\nTo summarize, a video that was posted by a Miami based roofing company in 2011 is being falsely shared in the context of the coronavirus outbreak in China. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
