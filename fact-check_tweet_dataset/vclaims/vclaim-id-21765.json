President Barack Obama\u2019s golf getaways were the subject of constant conservative consternation.\n\nEnter President Donald Trump, the tweeter in chief. People are turning to Trump\u2019s favorite social medium to complain about tax dollars spent protecting first lady Melania Trump and son Barron, who still live in Trump Tower in New York.\n\nOne common comparison we\u2019ve seen says that Melania Trump\u2019s security detail at Trump Tower costs more than the annual budget for the National Endowment for the Arts, which the administration reportedly has considered eliminating altogether.\n\nWe wanted to know how the argument held up. Problem is, there\u2019s no good number for how much Melania Trump\u2019s New York security detail costs.\n\nWe\u2019ll start with what we know: The National Endowment for the Arts\u2019 budget was a little under $148 million for fiscal year 2016, and it\u2019s requested a budget of about $150 million for fiscal year 2017, according to its website.\n\nTo top the 2016 amount, Melania and Barron would need to stay at Trump Tower for an entire year with a detail costing more than $405,000 a day. To beat the 2017 budget request, the security costs would need to exceed $410,000 a day.\n\nDuring the transition period, the city took on most of the cost of protecting the Trumps in New York. A spokesperson for New York mayor Bill de Blasio told us Donald, Melania and Barron Trump ran up a $37 million bill for security from Election Day to the inauguration Jan. 20. (De Blasio has requested the federal government reimburse his city for security costs, and Congress has doled about $7 million.)\n\nIn comparison, the city of Chicago spent at least $2.2 million to protect Obama\u2019s home in Chicago from his election in November 2008 to his inauguration in January 2009, the Chicago Tribune reported.\n\nCBS\u2019 New York affiliate reported, based on anonymous sources, that the city spends $500,000 a day to protect Trump Tower when the president is there, but less when it\u2019s just Melania and Barron. That figure, de Blasio spokesperson Freddi Goldstein said, likely refers to the daily cost of security ($37 million divided by 74 days).\n\nBut the mayor\u2019s office has yet to complete an estimate for the cost of the first lady and Barron\u2019s security detail alone, and believes it\u2019ll be less than $500,000 a day.\n\nGoldstein told us even if the president were visiting New York, the price tag would likely be less today as much of the activity outside Trump Tower has dissipated since the first months of his election.\n\nTrump told reporters in November that his wife and youngest son would join him at the White House \"very soon, after he\u2019s finished with school,\" which indicate a mid-year move. The White House said this month that Melania Trump will move to the White House at the end of the school year and split time between New York and Washington.\n\nSocial media posts say Melania Trump\u2019s security detail at Trump Tower costs more than the annual budget for the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nThat\u2019s a flawed projection based on incomplete data. It assumes that Melania and Barron Trump will stay at Trump Tower the entire year, racking up a security bill of more than $410,000 a day, every day. But officials say the Melania Trump and her son intend to move to the White House at the end of the school year and split time between Washington and New York.\n\nWhat the first family will actually do we don\u2019t know. But neither do bloggers.\n\nThey should back off this claim until there is more data. We rate it Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
