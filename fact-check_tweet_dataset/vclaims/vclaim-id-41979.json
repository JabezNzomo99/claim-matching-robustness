The claim is false; the two photos, one of which has been doctored, were actually taken in Miami and Paris.\n\nThe photos were published in this tweet on December 5, 2019. One of the images shows an individual with paint brushes and paint-stained clothes posing in front of a mural. The other photo shows an artist painting another mural.\n\nThe tweet has received more than 597 likes and 57 retweets. Below is a screenshot of the misleading tweet:\n\nThe Sinhala text translates to English as: \u201cMirissa \u201d\n\nMirissa is a coastal town in Sri Lanka, situated about 170 kilometers south of the capital Colombo.\n\nThe same photos were shared hundreds of times after being published here, here, here and here on Facebook alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the photos were actually taken in Miami and Paris, and one of the images was digitally altered.\n\nA reverse image search on Google of the photo of the mural and the artist found this 2017 article published in Submerge, a California-based entertainment magazine.\n\nThe article features a similar image and identifies the painter as a street artist named Miles Toland. It adds that Toland painted the mural, titled \u201cTurquoise dream,\u201d in Miami, USA in 2016.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the original photo in the Submerge article:\n\nA comparison of the image published by Submerge and the first image in the misleading posts reveals the coconut grove behind the wall was added to the image in the misleading posts.\n\nThe yellow street markings in the original photo were also removed in the image in the misleading posts, and the colour saturation was altered.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the Submerge image (L) and the picture in the misleading post (R):\n\nThe same mural was featured here on Toland\u2019s official website. The caption states the painting was completed in Miami in 2016.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the mural on Toland\u2019s website:\n\nA reverse image search of the second photo in the misleading posts found this page on HiveMiner, a data mining tool for image hosting service Flickr.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the image listed on HiveMiner:\n\nThe tags on the image state that the photo shows Toland working on a mural in 2016 for Project Saato, an urban art initiative in Paris. The mural was also featured on Project Saato\u2019s official website here.\n\nThe artwork was also featured here on Toland\u2019s official website, which states that the mural was completed in Paris in 2016.
