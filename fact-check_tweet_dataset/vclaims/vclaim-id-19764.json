The article also quotes Polyanskiy himself.\n\nThe Russian representative\u2019s letter focuses on the open source investigation organization Bellingcat, which he accuses of promoting claims based on \u201cfake evidence\u201d and being funded by \u201cAmerican and Western funds that traditionally support anti-Russian campaigns.\u201d\n\nThis is yet another attack in a series, a Russian government campaign against Bellingcat targeted for its role in the investigation of the downing of the Malaysian passenger jet, which killed all 298 people abroad and for which Russia was officially incriminated.\n\nPolyanskiy\u2019s letter meanders through the Kremlin\u2019s version of the MH17 investigation and we will get to that. But first, let\u2019s deal with his description of of Bellingcat\u2019s investigations, as \u201cbased on fakes.\".\n\nBellingat\u2019s own disclaimer says, it \u201cuses open source and social media investigation to investigate a variety of subjects from Mexican drug lords to conflicts\u201d across the globe.\n\nOn the topic of fake evidence, Bellingcat has long offered an open challenge to Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry, Defense Ministry, and now the U.N. Mission, to demonstrate that they used falsified evidence in their work.\n\nBut who exactly funds Bellingcat? Cursory research shows that it was started with crowdfunding via Kickstarter in 2014, when it raised 50,891 GBP. Later, Bellingcat received funding from other sources, such as the Open Society Foundation (OSF) and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). Bellingcat\u2019s founder Eliot Higgins openly declared this funding in 2017 on Twitter.\n\n\u201cCurrently about 50% of our funding comes from NED, OSF, Addessium and Pax for Peace, and the other 50% comes from the workshops we run, which I advertise on the website,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAccording to Higgins, grants from the OSF and NED help pay for programs to assist journalists and researchers in doing their own investigations, not Bellingcat\u2019s investigations.\n\n\u201cMost our funding from grants covers stuff that isn't related to investigating anything Russia related,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cLike our MH17 work was mainly done by volunteers, same with the Syria work.\u201d Said Higgins. \u201cAlso, it's only in the last year or so our budget has been big enough to hire lots of staff. We've gone from four full time staff members last year to nine this year.\u201d\n\nIn addition to helping to fund training programs, the Open Society Foundation\u2019s grants pay to translate Bellingcat\u2019s material into Russian, and they also pay for an investigator who does research on opaque ownership schemes in Britain, which facilitate money laundering.\n\nHe also mentioned that the organization had to do another crowdfunding drive via Kickstarter in 2017.\n\nWhile Bellingcat has recently received funding from foundations, which Mr. Polyanskiy may consider to be engaged in \u201canti-Russian\u201d activity, Higgins says that money was not used to finance the organization\u2019s work on Syria or MH17, which was done by volunteers and mostly crowdfunded.\n\nNow, to the issue of \u201cfakes.\u201dThe Deputy Representative made a number of assertions in his letter which have been thoroughly debunked by Polygraph.info and others on several occasions, mostly on the topic of MH17 and Russian involvement in the war in Ukraine.\n\nFor example, Polyanskiy says Russia provided \u201cprimary radar data\u201d and \u201cclassified information on Buk missiles\u201d but that the International Joint Investigative Team \u201cshowed particular distrust to our findings and contribution\u201d and \u201cbegan to rely more and more on social media.\u201d\n\nActually, investigators displayed a shell casing in a May 2018 news conference. News photos (Reuters) established the Buk missiles that Russia said were decommissioned in 2011 were still in use years later.\n\nPolyanskiy, in his letter, states that Ukraine officials are responsible for the four year old conflict in the Donbas because of their \u201cobsession to punish their own citizens by military force for their desire to preserve their language and culture.\u201d\n\nPolygraph.info debunked this line of thinking months ago, with evidence establishing that Russian citizens served as \u201ckey military and political leaders\u201d of the so-called separatists and that it was a former GRU officer \u2013 military intelligence from Russia -- who lead the \u201cmilitia\u201d from the first days of the armed conflict.\n\nRussia\u2019s UN representative writes of Bellingcat's use of evidence from \"social media\" without going into detail about what that actually means.\n\nBellingcat specializes in open source investigations \u2013 this means investigating using publicly available sources of information, including social media. Tweets and social network posts have been used to determine the time or location of events by investigative media, government intelligence, military, law enforcement and businesses around the world.\n\nPhotographs and videos posted on social media also provide valuable information which can be used to determine where events took place or who was involved in them.\n\nFor example, Bellingcat wrote one article in which its investigators compiled a selection of social media posts from the day Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down over Eastern Ukraine. One of the posts comes from the VK page \"Dispatches from Strelkov,\" named after the commander of pro-Russian forces and Russian citizen Igor Girkin AKA \"Strelkov.\" In it, Strelkov boasts that his forces shot down a Ukrainian AN-26 military cargo plane, complete with pictures of smoke rising from the crash site. The story was picked up by the Russian state media outlet TASS and remains up to this day, despite the fact that the \"AN-26\" was later discovered to have been the civilian airliner MH17.", "lang": "en"}
