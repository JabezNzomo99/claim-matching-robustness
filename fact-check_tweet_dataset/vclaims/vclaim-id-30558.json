After introducing himself and thanking the organiser for distributing blankets to differently-abled persons, he is seen as getting up from the wheelchair and walking away. This video has been labelled as an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) propaganda video with the insinuation that the event was stage-managed and those receiving blankets were masquerading as differently-abled persons.\n\nOn January 30, @ugtunga, a Twitter-user, posted the viral video and said, \u201cMagic blanket from AAP. The moment this divyang got the blanket he started walking. See it to believe it\u201d It has been retweeted over 1,200 times.\n\nOn January 29, Bhubaneshwar-based IPS officer Arun Bothra tweeted the viral video and said, \u201cBreaking news: Magical blanket makes \u2018specially abled\u2019 person discard his wheel chair & walk briskly.\u201d Unlike several social media users, Bothra didn\u2019t link this video with a political party. His tweet was retweeted over 1,100 times.\n\nSimilarly, several Twitter and Facebook users have shared the viral video, claiming it\u2019s an AAP propaganda video.\n\nAlt News has received several requests to fact-check the viral video on WhatsApp (+91 76000 11160) and on our official mobile app.\n\nThe man in the viral video introduced himself as Ramesh Singh. In the background, a banner can be spotted with a Hindi text which reads \u2018Digital Saksharta Sansthan [Translated from \u0921\u093f\u091c\u093f\u091f\u0932 \u0938\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0930\u0924\u093e \u0938\u0902\u0938\u094d\u0925\u093e\u0928].\u2019\n\nA second keyword search led us to the Facebook page of \u2018Digital Sakshrta Sansthan\u2019. According to the page, it is an NGO based out of, Uttar Pradesh. On the same profile, Alt News found a fact-check report by Abhitak, a Moradabad-based Hindi news channel. We found a video report on Abhitak\u2018s YouTube channel as well.\n\nIn the Abhitak report, Singh displayed his proof of disability and said, \u201cThere is some misunderstanding among the masses. I\u2019m really disabled and I have proof. I have UD ID (Unique Disability ID) which states I\u2019ve 40% disability.\u201d The reporter asked him to comment on the controversial moment when he stood up from the wheelchair, Singh replied, \u201cWhile receiving the gift, I was made to sit (on the wheelchair). When I stood up, people (who saw the video) couldn\u2019t understand the nature of my disability.\u201d\n\nAlt News also noticed that Digital Sakshrta Sansthan\u2019s Facebook account has uploaded several other videos from the event. A video uploaded on January 19, shows the full sequence of another man receiving the blanket on a wheelchair and then getting up.\n\nOn February 1, The Quint published a fact-check report according to which, Najam was the reporter on duty for Abhitak. It reported that Singh has a locomotor disability. The Quint\u2019s report also has photos of Singh\u2019s Unique Disability ID. Alt News has not uploaded the photos in for the sake of privacy.\n\nWhile speaking to The Quint, Najam said, \u201cThe man sitting on the wheelchair is Ramesh Singh and the one giving the blanket is Ravi Saini. AAP is not involved in this in any manner.\u201d The report added that Saini is a part of the \u2018Digital Saksharta Sansthan\u2019. Siani told The Quint that they had organised a programme to distribute 100 blankets to the differently-abled.\n\nAlt News did a keyword search and found the Twitter account of Saini. He tweeted local media reports of the event.\n\nMoreover, looking at Saini\u2019s Twitter account (screenshot attached below) one can assess that it is unlikely that he is associated with AAP.\n\nTherefore, the social media claim that Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) distributed blankets to the people who were not differently-abled for their propaganda is false.", "lang": "en"}
