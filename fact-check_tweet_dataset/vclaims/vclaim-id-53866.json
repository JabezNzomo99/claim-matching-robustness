The driver was almost to his truck by the time I opened the door, bent to pick up the box and said thank you. He turned and walked back toward the house. He said, \u2018Ma\u2019am, these deliveries come from the distribution center. We\u2019ve had positive testing for the virus. Leave the box out here in the sun for six to eight hours, then open the box and take the item out of any packaging before you take it in the house. Leave the box and packaging outside. Then go wash your hands immediately.\u2019 Wow. Good information but this is getting freaky.\"\n\nSadly, there still is no proof that the sun can kill COVID-19.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It was soon deleted, but we found the same claim elsewhere.\n\nPreliminary research into coronavirus indicates it can live on cardboard surfaces like boxes for up to 24 hours. But there is no evidence that sun exposure kills the coronavirus, as we said in rating False a claim that \"being exposed to the sun for two hours\" kills the virus.\n\nWe also rated False a more general claim \u2014 that sun can kill the coronavirus. That claim was made by U.S. Rep. Greg Murphy, a North Carolina Republican and a physician. Experts said ultraviolet rays in sunlight aren\u2019t intense enough to kill the virus.\n\nThat sunlight isn\u2019t strong enough has also been reported by AFP Fact Check.\n\nSo what should you do about your cardboard packages? After digging into the research and advisories from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Wirecutter\u2019s Ganda Suthivarakom on March 24 wrote: \"The CDC\u2019s advice on protecting yourself does not include advice on disinfecting packages. Its general advice stands: Wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people.\"\n\nTo be extra cautious, she writes, \"you can dispose of the outer packaging outside your home and wash your hands immediately after handling.\"\n\nThere isn\u2019t evidence that leaving items in the sun can protect you from contracting the coronavirus. The best way to avoid COVID-19 is to wash your hands with soap and water, avoid touching your face, disinfect surfaces in your home daily and avoid close contact with people.", "lang": "en"}
