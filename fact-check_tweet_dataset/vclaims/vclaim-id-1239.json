The text contains several allegations about the UK response to COVID-19. These claims have been denied by the National Health Service. The post also claims there has been \u201cno pandemic\u201d in the UK, which is false.\n\nThe lengthy text has been posted by multiple Facebook users, with some versions shared hundreds of times (here, here, here) as of July 16, 2020.\n\nThe text includes the line: \u201cIn my opinion, and that of many of my colleagues, there has been no Covid Pandemic, certainly not in the Surrey region and I have heard from other colleagues this picture is the same throughout the country\u201d. It further adds: \u201cThere has been no pandemic and this goes a long way to explain why figures for the UK are so much higher than anywhere else in Europe.\u201d\n\nIn the most recent weekly COVID-19 surveillance report published by Public Health England (PHE) (here) there were 33,064 cases of COVID-19 recorded in South East England, which includes Surrey, and 5,247 deaths for the period from January 30 to July 7. Across the whole of England for the same period there were 246,386 cases and 39,815 deaths.\n\nStatistics from PHE also show daily excess deaths in England across the year to date [figure 32] (here). These figures show that for 10 weeks in 2020 there were significant excess deaths, outside the margin of error, in England. The figures also show significant excess deaths for nine weeks in South East England [tables 5a and 5b].\n\nIn a statement made to the British public on March 12, 2020, the Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the \"global pandemic\" of COVID-19 was the \"worst public health crisis for a generation\" (here ).\n\nOn July 7, 2020, Reuters reported that the United Kingdom\u2019s suspected COVID-19 death toll had surpassed 55,000, according to a Reuters tally of official data sources that underline the country\u2019s status as one of the worst hit in the world (here ).\n\nIn addition to falsely suggesting the UK faced no pandemic, the post makes various other claims regarding hospital capacity, ambulance use, death certificates and face mask use by hospital staff.\n\nA spokesperson for the NHS told Reuters: \u201cThe content and claims made within this social media post are not recognised by the local NHS and it is absolutely right that it has now been removed by Facebook as part of their role in stopping the spread of misinformation and harmful content about COVID-19.\u201d This statement was supported by South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust and Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust.\n\nFalse. The claims made in this text have been refuted by the NHS and ambulance services and are not supported by official statistics for COVID-19-related cases and deaths in England.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
