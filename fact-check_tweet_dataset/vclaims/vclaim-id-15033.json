This article is a fact check of the claims.\n\nHas India eliminated maternal and neo-natal tetanus?\n\n The first claim is that \u2018India has validated elimination of maternal and neo-natal tetanus in May 2015, before the global target of December 2015\u2019.\n\nA response in Lok Sabha from August 2016 stated that \u2018WHO has certified Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus Elimination (MNTE) in India in May 2015, well before the global target date of December 2015. WHO has also certified India to be free from YAWS, a chronic bacterial disease, in May 2016\u2019.\n\nHave action plans for elimination of leprosy, measles and TB been implemented?\n\n The second claim is that \u2018action plans to eliminate leprosy by 2018, measles by 2020 and Tuberculosis by 2025 implemented\u2019.\n\nAn answer given in the Lok Sabha to a similar question in December 2017, shows that target years have been set by the government to eliminate Leprosy, Measles and Tuberculosis. It states that \u2018Elimination of Leprosy i.e., 1 case/ 10000 population at National level was already achieved in the year 2005. The short term target is reduction of Grade II disability cases to less than one million population, as per WHO document on Global Leprosy Strategy, 2016 \u2013 2020\u2019.\n\nIt also states that \u2018as on 18th December 2017, more than 6.5 crore children have been vaccinated with MR vaccine (against measles) in 13 States/UTs\u2019. It also finally points out that \u2018the incidence of TB has reduced from 217 per lakh per year in 2015 to 211 per lakh per year in 2016 and mortality has reduced from 36 per lakh per year in 2015 to 32 per lakh per year in 2016\u2019. These action plans are continuous works of various governments and they have been implementing action plans and vaccination programmes. For example, \u2018Government of India introduced measles vaccine across the country in 1985 under the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP). To further reduce the measles burden, a second dose of measles vaccine was introduced in the country in the year 2010\u2019.\n\nWhat is mission Indradhanush?\n\n The third claim is that \u2018Mission Indradhanush completed four phases covering 528 districts\u2019\n\nImmunization Program in India was introduced in 1978 as \u2018Expanded Program of Immunization\u2019 (EPI) by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. In 1985, the program was modified as \u2018Universal Immunization Program\u2019 (UIP) to be implemented in phased manner to cover all districts in the country by 1989-90 with the one of largest health programs in the world. Despite being operational for many years, UIP has been able to fully immunize only 65% children in the first year of their life.\n\nAccording to the National health portal of Government of India, to strengthen and re-energize the program and achieve full immunization coverage for all children and pregnant women at a rapid pace, the Government of India launched \u2018Mission Indradhanush\u2019 in December 2014. As per the portal, the ultimate goal of Mission Indradhanush is to ensure full immunization with all available vaccines for children up to two years of age and pregnant women. An answer in Lok Sabha from April 2017 has stated that \u2018in order to realize the objective set under Mission Indradhanush, the Government has completed three phases of Mission Indradhanush across 497 districts and the fourth phase is ongoing in 68 districts across 8 north eastern states since February\u201917\u2019. Another answer is Lok Sabha from August 2018 has pointed out that \u2018No separate funds are allocated for Mission Indradhanush. Funds allocated for Routine Immunization under part C of Programme Implementation Plan (PIP) are being utilized by the states to carryout activities under Mission Indradhanush\u2019. In other words, though the program has been given a new name, it is being implemented with fund allocated for routine immunization.\n\nHave 80 lakh pregnant women been immunized?\n\n The fourth claim, related to the previous claim is that \u201880.63 lakh pregnant women immunized\u2019.\n\nAccording to an answer provided in Lok Sabha from August 2018, a total of 81.78 lakh pregnant women have been immunized under mission Indradhanush.\n\nHave 3 crore children been vaccinated?\n\n The last claim, also related to the earlier claim is that \u20183.15 crore children vaccinated\u2019.\n\nIn an answer provided in the Lok Sabha in August 2018, it is stated that \u2018319.28 lakh children have been immunized by August 2018\u2019.But this is not the first time that such large scale vaccination drives have taken place in India. The immunization program is one of the oldest government programs. For instance, 7.78 crore children across India were vaccinated in 109 districts for Japanese Encephalitis between 2006 & 2010. In 2013-14, 1.2 crore children were vaccinated with Measles vaccine in 45 districts in 13 States with 87.2% coverage. During Phase II, 3.6 crore children were vaccinated in 152 districts in 14 States. The Phase III of the campaign 11.8 crore children (85%) had been vaccinated in 167 districts in 5 States i.e. Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bihar.\n\nThis story is part of a larger series on the 4-years of the Modi government.
