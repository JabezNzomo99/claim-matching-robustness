We can help! We can take your competition off the streets for FREE. Report your competition to us.\"\n\nSnopes.com\u2019s Oct. 26, 2015 analysis said a person at the Lumberton Police Department, whom it did not identify, confirmed that the ad ran, though didn\u2019t recall when. Snopes.com said it spotted the ad in an August 2015 Facebook post.\n\nDid police in the Southeast Texas town really place an ad encouraging drug dealers to nark each other out? We were curious enough to check it out on our own.\n\nBy phone, David Lisenby, editor of the weekly Lumberton Ledger, confirmed that the Lumberton Police Department placed the ad. Lisenby added that the department subsequently purchased another direct appeal about dealers.\n\nLisenby said he suggested the ads in hopes of encouraging community involvement.\n\nLisenby emailed us copies of the first ad, which appeared in the paper\u2019s Aug. 5, 2015, edition, and the follow-up ad, published Sept. 2, 2015.\n\nThe second ad showed a marijuana leaf over a message directed to \"drug users:\" \"Has your drug dealer ripped you off?\" the second ad says. \"Do you want justice? We can help! We can enact justice for you \u2026 for FREE.\"\n\nWondering if the ads touched off a wave of snitching, we unsuccessfully tried to connect with Chief Danny Sullins of the Lumberton Police Department. Separately, a clerk for the county attorney in Hardin County, Telisha Green, told us by phone that police reports submitted to the office as backup for misdemeanor drug cases had yet to mention an instance of the ads leading to arrests. Prosecutors otherwise have no way of knowing, Green said, if the ads fueled investigations.\n\nBut David Sheffield, Hardin County\u2019s district attorney, said he\u2019s heard the ads touched off calls to law enforcement. Sheffield said, though, it\u2019s too early to judge results; investigations take time. Such an ad, he said, \"gets your attention and it generates talk. Maybe it prompts somebody to do something they\u2019d just been thinking about doing.\"\n\nA Facebook post spotted by Snopes.com said Lumberton police placed an ad encouraging drug dealers to turn in other dealers.\n\nActually, the Lumberton Police Department this year purchased two such ads in the local weekly. We didn\u2019t pin down if the ads led to fresh snitching.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
