The remaining 11% said they didn\u2019t know. Another poll found 40% didn\u2019t think there should be another referendum in the next few years, while the remaining 60% were split over whether there should be a referendum either before or after the UK negotiates to leave the EU.\n\nSince then, support seems to have dropped off slightly. Several polls towards the end of last year showed a majority of Scots against having a second referendum. Meanwhile a poll just last month found that 51% of people asked didn\u2019t want another Scottish independence referendum in the next few years. Another 27% said it should be before the UK negotiates to leave the EU in two years and the other 21% said that it should be in two years once the negotiations are complete.\n\nThe problem with comparing all these polls is that they don\u2019t ask exactly the same question. For example people might answer questions differently if they\u2019re given different options, such as whether there should be a referendum but not until a few years have passed. This means it's difficult to get a consistent picture of how people\u2019s views on another Scottish independence referendum are changing, or not.\n\nPolling expert, Professor John Curtice, has said that there seems to be \u201climited enthusiasm\u201d for another independence referendum in Scotland. He has also said that people\u2019s view on whether there should be another referendum \u201clargely reflect[s] people\u2019s preferences on the question of independence in the first place\u201d.\n\nThis is something we do have more consistent information on. When asked how they would vote if there was another referendum tomorrow people\u2019s answers showed a similar pattern of increased support after the Brexit result, followed by a fall since then. The most recent polls have found just over 40% of people in favour of independence.\n\nThere is \u201cinsufficient evidence to draw the conclusion that the disagreement over Brexit between the UK and the Scottish governments has altered the balance of opinion on independence\u201d, according to Professor Curtice.", "lang": "en"}
