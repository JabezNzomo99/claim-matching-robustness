While the substances listed are present in certain vaccines, medical research suggest the levels are not harmful to the public.\n\nUnder the heading \u201cVaccine Ingredients\u201d the image lists the following ingredients and risks associated with each: \u201cformaldehyde (toxic chemical, used in embalming), aluminum (toxic to the brain), gelatin (mashed up animal parts), urea (waste from human urine), potassium phosphate (used for fertilizer), human albumin (different kinds of human blood), polysorbate 80 (can cause infertility, toxic chemical), 2-phenoxyethanol (used for antifreeze), yeast protein (a fungus) and monosodium L-glutamate (causes diabetes & weight-gain)\u201d ( here ; here ).\n\nOne image is accompanied by text that reads: \u201cThis is disgusting what they put in vaccines and convince you it\u2019s good for you.\u201d This claim on social media contains a mix of accurate and inaccurate information.\n\nReuters recently fact-checked a claim about the flu vaccine containing toxic levels of formaldehyde ( here ). The formaldehyde in vaccines poses no documented safety risks like the ones listed in the post on social media.\n\nAluminum can be found in several vaccines including DTaP and Hepatitis A ( here ).\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) writes that aluminum, a naturally occurring metal also present in nature, has been used safely in vaccines for decades. Aluminum salts act as vaccine adjuvants, or ingredients used to help stimulate a stronger immune response in the body. The CDC says, \u201cadjuvanted vaccines can cause more local reactions (such as redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site) and more systemic reactions (such as fever, chills and body aches) than non-adjuvanted vaccines.\u201d It also notes, however, that \u201cin all cases, vaccines containing adjuvants are tested for safety and effectiveness in clinical trials before they are licensed for use in the United States, and they are continuously monitored by CDC and FDA once they are approved.\u201d ( here )\n\nThe Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia notes that adjuvants allow \u201clesser quantities of the vaccine and fewer doses\u201d, by stimulating the body\u2019s immune response. It adds that, \u201cthe quantities of aluminum present in vaccines are low and are regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).\u201d ( here )\n\nGelatin is commonly found in some measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), typhoid and yellow fever vaccines, while urea is less common, but can be found in dengue and varicella vaccines ( here ).\n\nThe CDC notes that in addition to the antigens from viruses or bacteria contained in vaccines, there are also small amounts of other inactive ingredients known as excipients. Some excipients are known as stabilizers, or ingredients used \u201cto keep the vaccine potent during transportation and storage\u201d ( here ). Gelatin and urea are two such excipients.\n\nThe Vaccine Knowledge Project (VKP) managed by the Oxford Vaccine Group at the University of Oxford states that gelatin \u201cderived from pigs is used in some live vaccines as a stabiliser to protect live viruses against the effects of temperature. Gelatine in vaccines is highly purified and hydrolysed (broken down by water), so it is different from the natural gelatine used in foods\u201d ( here ). Its \u201cvaccine ingredients\u201d page does note that there have been a small number of documented cases of allergic reactions to vaccines containing gelatin (about one case per 2 million).\n\nThe VKP also states that urea, a harmless organic compound found in the body, is also sometimes used as a stabilizer in vaccines. Urea, also known as carbamide, \u201coccurs not only in the urine of all mammals but also in their blood, bile, milk, and perspiration\u201d as proteins are broken down by normal bodily functions ( here ).\n\nIt is therefore true that gelatin and urea are sometimes contained in vaccines as stabilizers, but to call them \u201cmashed up animal parts\u201d and \u201cwaste from human urine\u201d is misleading.\n\nSalts based on potassium phosphate can commonly be found in different kinds of influenza vaccines ( here ).\n\nThey are \u201ccommon and harmless\u201d acidity regulators, according to the Vaccine Knowledge Project ( here ). \u201cAs well as keeping the pH balance,\u201d the VKP states, \u201cthey also help to keep the fragments of active ingredient suspended in the water, so that they do not settle out.\u201d\n\nPotassium phosphate can be present in plant fertilizer. Its role centers around providing and helping a plant store nutrients ( here ). It is also present in many foods, acting as a storing agent. While in large doses it can cause harm, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) categorizes dipotassium phosphate as \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS) ( here ).\n\nIt is true that potassium phosphate salts are used in vaccines but they are only present in small quantities and pose no credible safety concerns.\n\nThe CDC includes \u201chuman serum albumin\u201d\u2014 an abundant protein found in human blood plasma \u2014 as an excipient found in vaccines against smallpox and rabies( here ).\n\nThe VKP also recognizes the use of human serum albumin as a preservative or stabilizer in vaccines, usually listed as an inactive ingredient ( here ).\n\nA 2003 study in the Academy of American Pediatricians\u2019 journal Pediatrics states that human serum albumin is contained in certain MMR vaccines. The publication states: \u201cbecause human serum albumin is derived from human blood there is a theoretical risk that it might contain infectious agents. However, the FDA requires that human serum albumin be derived from blood of screened donors and be manufactured in a manner that would eliminate the risk of transmission of all known viruses. The result is that no viral diseases have ever been associated with the use of human serum albumin.\u201d ( here )\n\nIt is therefore true that human serum albumin is contained in some vaccines and this stems from human plasma, but no viral diseases have been associated with its use.\n\nAccording to the CDC, polysorbate 80 is an excipient commonly found in vaccines for influenza, Hepatitis B, HPV, and meningococcus ( here ).\n\nThe VKP states that polysorbate 80 is an emulsifier commonly used in food and drinks ( here ). According to Medical News Today, polysorbate 80 is \u201cused in the food industry in ice creams, gelatin desserts, barbecue sauce, and pickled products. In vaccines, it helps other components remain soluble.\u201d ( here )\n\nAlthough some studies have raised safety concerns related to reproductive problem ( here ) an expert group at the European Medicines Agency has categorized the danger of polysorbate 80 as \u201cvery low\u201d ( here ).\n\nIt is therefore true that polysorbate 80, a common emulsifier in the food industry, can be used in vaccines to keep components soluble, but health experts have determined risk of exposure to the substance as low. To call it a \u201ctoxic chemical\u201d is therefore misleading.\n\nAccording to the FDA, 2-Phenoxyethanol is an organic chemical compound that is sometimes used in cosmetics and antiseptics. The FDA states that the compound \u201cis also currently used as a preservative in one FDA-approved available vaccine, Ipol, for the prevention of polio, at a concentration of 0.5%.\u201d ( here )\n\nA 2010 study entitled \u201cThe relative toxicity of compounds used as preservatives in vaccines and biologics\u201d found that the relative toxicity of the preservative 2-phenoxyethanol on human cells was less than alternative preservatives used in vaccines ( here ). The study, however, also noted that: \u201cnone of the compounds commonly used as preservatives in US licensed vaccine/biological preparations can be considered an ideal preservative, and their ability to fully comply with the requirements of the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) for preservatives is in doubt.\u201d\n\nThe National Library of Medicine has compiled case reports of some vaccine reactions stemming from the presence of 2-phenoexyethanol ( here ). Reuters was otherwise unable to corroborate a list of comprehensive safety concerns related to the substance when administered through vaccines.\n\nYeast protein can be found among excipient ingredients for Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, and HPV vaccines ( here ).\n\nThe Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia states that Hepatitis B vaccines are \u201cmade using baker\u2019s yeast and residual quantities of yeast proteins are contained in the final product.\u201d It also notes that severe allergic reactions have been reported by recipients of the Hepatitis B vaccine, although an allergy to yeast is not confirmed to be the cause of these reactions ( here ).\n\nThe CDC warns that the \u201cHepatitis B vaccine is not recommended for anyone who is allergic to yeast, or to any other component of the vaccine\u201d and it can pose the risk of a severe allergic reaction to those with hyper-sensitivity to yeast ( here , here ).\n\nMonosodium L-glutamate is a common excipient in vaccines for adenovirus, influenza, and varicella ( here ).\n\nThe Military Health System writes that monosodium L-glutamate is \u201ca stabilizer that protects vaccines from heat, light, humidity or acidity while they are stored.\u201d ( here )\n\nThe National Library of Medicine states that monosodium L-glutamate is the \u201coptically active\u201d form monosodium glutamate, commonly known as MSG and used as a flavoring agent ( here ). The FDA considers that MSG is \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d although people may consider themselves sensitive to its ingestion ( here ).\n\nIt is therefore true that monosodium L-glutamate is used in vaccines as a stabilizer, but this substance is recognized as safe.\n\nPartly false claim. Some vaccines contain small amounts of formaldehyde, aluminum, gelatin, urea, potassium phosphate, human albumin, polysorbate 80, 2-phenoxyethanol, yeast protein and monosodium L-glutamate but the presence of these substances does not pose a credible safety concern.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
