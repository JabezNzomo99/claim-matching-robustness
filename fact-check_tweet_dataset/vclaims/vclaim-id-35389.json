Kamala Harris never called on fellow Democrats to \"round up the Trump supporters,\" despite what a repeatedly debunked story says.\n\nTrump Train Pro News is the latest site to recycle a bogus quote that purports to show Harris threatening supporters of President Donald Trump.\n\n\"When he\u2019s gone and we have recaptured our legitimate spot in the White House, watch out in the event that you bolstered him and supported his activities, since we\u2019ll be seeking you next,\" Harris is falsely quoted as saying. \"You will feel the retaliation of a country.\"\n\nThe Trump Train Pro News story, posted Feb. 9 on Facebook, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation.
