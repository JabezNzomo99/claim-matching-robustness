No, that's not true: the story was made up by a website that claims to be satire but which is in effect part of a network of fake news websites run from Ghana. There is no truth to the news.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by [email protected] on July 11, 2018 titled \"Malian 'Spiderman' loses French citizenship and faces deportation - [email protected]\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nMamoudou Gassama, the Malian 'Spiderman' in a viral video who saved a kid from falling from a balcony in France has had his French citizenship revoked. The Malian migrant who was hailed as a hero after mounting a daring rescue to save the small boy dangling from a balcony in Paris was made a French citizen. In a report by the S\u00fbret\u00e9 nationale, the National Police of France, Mamoudou Gassama's heroic rescue was staged.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe site [email protected] carries a satire disclaimer at the bottom of the page (which it copied from another site):\n\nYour Attention Needed\n\nsat\u00b7ire ~\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nthe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, OR ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.\n\nIf you disagree with the definition of satire or have decided it is synonymous with \"comedy,\" you should really just move along.\n\nNo French news websites reported on the story so it is pretty safe to say it is fake news.\n\nIn addition the site contains ID's from Google's Adsense advertisting network that were also found on sites that were part of a large network of fake news sites run out of Ghana. We suspect the same people are trying to build up a new network after the previous one shut down after being exposed.\n\nWe wrote about news7pm.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:", "lang": "en"}
