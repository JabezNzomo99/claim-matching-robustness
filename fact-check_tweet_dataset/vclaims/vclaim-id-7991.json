A New York Times obituary from 4 October 2014 described his rule over Haiti as one of \u201cbloody brutality\u201d, widespread corruption, and lavish excess:\n\nOnce he fled, a new government in Haiti attempted recover these assets, which they believed the Duvalier regime had looted from the government and people of Haiti. A 14 July 1986 story in New York Magazine first reported that one of the assets the government of Haiti was trying to seize was an apartment in Trump Tower purchased in August 1983 through a shell corporation:\n\nInvestigators working for the new government of Haiti have uncovered what they believe is almost $5 million worth of New York real estate owned by interests linked to the family of deposed president Jean-Claude Duvalier. These assets consist of five Manhattan apartments, including a fifty-fourth-floor Trump Tower condominium bought in August 1983 for $1.65 million. This is the first reported instance of Duvalier assets being discovered in the United States.\n\nThe apartment in question, 54K, was purchased by \u201cLasa Trade and Finance\u201d and \u2014 at the time of the 1986 article \u2014 was occupied by a friend of the Duvaliers named Jean \u201cJohnny\u201d Sambour.\n\nSerendipitously, thanks to a combination of late telephone bills and several checks issued to Sambour by the Treasury of Haiti, a United States law firm hired by the Government of Haiti was able to ascertain that, indeed, the apartment was owned by the Duvaliers.\n\nRecounting his experience hunting down the assets of the Duvaliers in a 2009 New Yorker profile, prolific corporate intelligence investigator Jules Kroll (who had been hired by the U.S. law firm retained by the Haitian government) said that Duvalier\u2019s looting from the Haitian treasury was far from subtle:\n\nIn March 1987, President Ronald Reagan signed an executive order freezing any U.S.-based Duvalier assets, which included \u2014 according to the New York Times \u2014 Trump Tower apartment 54K.\n\nThe tale of Duvalier\u2019s ownership of a Trump Tower apartment gained renewed interest in January 2018, thanks to a BuzzFeed News investigation of possible money laundering by the Trump Organization, combined with Trump\u2019s alleged derogatory comments about Haiti.\n\nThat BuzzFeed report investigated every U.S. sale of a Trump Organization or Trump-branded property since 1980 to see how many fit the U.S. Government\u2019s criteria for possible money laundering, finding that a full 21 percent could fit that bill:\n\nTrump condo sales that match Treasury\u2019s characteristics of possible money laundering totaled $1.5 billion, BuzzFeed News calculated. They accounted for 21% of the 6,400 Trump condos sold in the US. Those figures include condos that Trump developed as well as condos that others developed in his name under licensing deals that pay Trump a fee or a percentage of sales. [\u2026] The property records analyzed by BuzzFeed News would not by themselves reveal money laundering \u2013 only warning signs.\n\nThat story does mention the Duvalier incident, reporting that Trump himself signed the deed of sale for Apartment 54K in 1983, but notes that there is no evidence that the Trump Organization, or Trump personally, participated in any untoward money laundering scheme in this case.\n\nHowever, as Donald Trump did sell an apartment in Trump Tower to Duvalier through a Panamanian shell corporation in 1983, we rank the claim as true.", "lang": "en"}
