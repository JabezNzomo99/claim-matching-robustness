Let\u2019s try to analyze the claims made in this WhatsApp forward message.\n\nThe message that \u2018Helpline-1098\u2019 is meant to pick up food leftovers from functions, parties, homes etc., and are used in feeding the hungry children is doing rounds since the past many years and is again being shared on Facebook.\n\nClaim: PM Modi announced a Tele-helpline service \u20181098\u2019 for picking up food leftovers from functions and parties.\n\nFact: Helpline service \u20181098\u2019 is a free Tele-helpline launched by CHILDLINE India Foundation(CIF) in 1996 to rescue the street children in distress. Hence the claims made in the message stand FALSE.\n\nThe message that \u2018Helpline-1098\u2019 is meant to pick up food leftovers from functions, parties, homes etc., and are used in feeding the hungry children is doing rounds since the past many years. But actually, it is a free Tele-helpline launched by CHILDLINE India Foundation(CIF) in 1996 to rescue the street children in distress. Given the extent of spread of this fake message, the CIF has put a notice on its website \u201cchildlineindia.org.in\u201d clarifying the public that its helpline is only meant to protect and take care of the street children in distress and have nothing to do with the collection of food leftovers. In the notice, it was mentioned as \u201cchain mail circulating\u201d, perhaps because this news might have been in circulation much before the entry of WhatsApp messaging application into India.\n\nTo sum it up, \u20181098\u2019 is not a Helpline to pick up the food leftovers, but a Helpline service for the street children in distress.\n\nDid you watch our Facebook live on Fake News (Misinformation)", "lang": "en"}
