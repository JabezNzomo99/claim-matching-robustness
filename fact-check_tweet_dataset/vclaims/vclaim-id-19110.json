The footage is being used in a misleading context; it actually shows Das winning her first gold medal in the women's 400 metres at the IAAF World Under-20 Championships in Tampere, Finland, in July 2018.\n\nThe one minute, 43 seconds video was published here on YouTube on July 20, 2019. It has been viewed more than 150,000 times.\n\nThe clip shows Indian sprinter Hima Das participating in a 400 metres women\u2019s race. The yellow text superimposed on the video states: \u201cHima Das Won 5th Gold 400 m Women\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nCorresponding videos with identical claims have also been viewed thousands of times in Facebook posts published in July 2019, including here and here.\n\nDas won her fifth gold medal in one month at this women\u2019s 400 metres race held on July 20, 2019 in Nove Mesto nad Metuji, Czech Republic.\n\nHer feat was reported by Indian media, for example here and here, and she also published this tweet about it on July 20 on her verified profile.\n\nHowever, the video in the misleading posts is from July 2018. It shows the moment Das won gold in the women\u2019s 400 metres race at the IAAF World Under-20 Championships in Tampere, Finland.\n\nDas uploaded an identical video of the same length here on her verified Facebook page on July 12, 2019.\n\nThe caption states: \u201cToday is the most memorable day of my life. On this day in 2018, i became the first Indian track athlete to win gold medal in the @iaaforg World U20 Championship. I will continue to work hard and achieve more for my country. #ProudIndian \n\n @afiindia @IndiaSports @Media_SAI @iosindiaoff\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading Facebook post (L) and the Facebook video uploaded by Hima Das (R):\n\nThe International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) reported on the outcome of that race on its website here on July 12, 2018.\n\nThe IAAF also posted this tweet on July 13, 2018, containing a shorter video of the race which matches the footage in the misleading YouTube video from around 1:02 to around 1:30, followed by some extra clips of her win filmed from different angles and in slow-motion.\n\nThat IAAF tweet is embedded below:\n\nDas also tweeted on July 13, 2018 here about winning her first gold medal.", "lang": "en"}
