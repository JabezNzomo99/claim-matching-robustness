But the illustration used with the post, of a man holding a yellow ribbon tied across a bridge, has already appeared online in the past, in posts linking it to either Kenya or Tanzania.\n\n\u201cJUST IN: A Member of House of Reps (APC) in Zamfara State commissioned a wooden bridge which was constructed at a cost of N10Million,\u201d claims the post, published on January 24 on the Facebook page Nigeria Politics Today.\n\n\u201cSometimes i feel like Nigeria was made for stand up comedies!!\u201d reads the post, which has been shared more than 2,900 times.\n\nThat post claimed the photograph showed a lawmaker from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), while other posts have also shared the image, claiming it shows a lawmaker from the main opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nThe man, who has his head facing down, has yet to be identified.\n\nBut AFP found the same image was used back in 2017 on posts linking it to Kenya.\n\nThe earliest version we could find is on the Kenyan news and entertainment website Nairobi Wire on February 6, 2017 as part of a gallery of \u201csome of the craziest images doing rounds on the internet\u201d. It did not give any details of when or where the picture was taken.\n\nA day later it appeared on Jamiiforums.com, a Swahili-language message board which says its offices are in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Comments under the post debate whether Tanzania\u2019s ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party has a future.\n\nSix months later the photo popped up again on \u201cChepalungu constituency wembe room\u201d, a Facebook page discussing politics in Bomet County, southwest Kenya. This time it appeared alongside comments on local Kenyan politics.\n\nWe\u2019re still working to identify the man standing on the bridge, but the suggestion that it was taken recently in Nigeria is false.", "lang": "en"}
