It shows some men at a gun range who appear to be testing out a very human-like robot by arming it with a gun and then hitting it and knocking it down. The robot continues to shoot, until a man orders it to shoot a robot dog. The human robot instead shoots at the man, takes the dog, and runs away.\n\nWhile some on social media complimented the video makers on their skill at creating a realistic-looking computer graphic, others like gun advocate Chris Loesch appeared to be alarmed by it, at least initially (Loesch later noted he knew the video was fake).\n\n\n\n It\u2019s not the first time a video created by Corridor has fooled people. In June 2019, a similar video in which a robot pulls a gun on humans who had been abusing it fooled people.\n\nBut Corridor posted an explainer video to a separate YouTube account (\u201cCorridor Crew\u201d) that explained the video was made using motion capture. In other words, it was a (human) actor playing the part of the robot, and the robot was digitally edited in later.\n\nIf anyone was fooled by Corridor\u2019s digital creation, it may be because robots have grown increasingly sophisticated, and viewers have been primed with real reports of robots who can shoot and do gymnastics.\n\nCorridor\u2019s \u201cBosstown Dynamics\u201d video is an apparent send-up of eerie marketing videos posted by robotics firm Boston Dynamics. The company\u2019s most recent video shows its robot creation dubbed \u201cAtlas\u201d performing gymnastics.", "lang": "en"}
