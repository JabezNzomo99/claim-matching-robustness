That means we\u2019re going to raise taxes on the wealthy and those who can afford to pay.\"\n\n\" ... But I\u2019ll tell you this,\" she added. \"I am the only candidate who ran in either primary who said, \u2018I will not raise taxes on the middle class.\u2019 And I mean that, and I won\u2019t do it.\"\n\nClinton began making that last fall, saying she would not raise taxes on those earning less than $250,000 a year.\n\nWe wondered whether she was, in fact, the only candidate in the heavily populated Democratic and Republican presidential primary fields to make a no-tax-hike pledge to the middle class.\n\nWe found that 13 of the 17 GOP candidates made promises last year that were far more encompassing than Clinton\u2019s. They vowed not to raise taxes on anyone - including the middle class.\n\nTwelve of them last year signed with Americans for Tax Reform, a fiscally conservative group founded by Grover Norquist. They promised to \"oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses\" and \"any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.\"\n\nLast year\u2019s 12 signers were , , , , , , , , , , and .\n\nA 13th GOP candidate, Mike Huckabee, signed a last year to oppose all tax increases.\n\nTwo other Republican candidates had signed an Americans for Tax Reform\u2019s no-tax pledge before last year: and .\n\nSo contrary to Clinton\u2019s claim, 15 of the 17 GOP candidates had signed no-tax-hike pledges - not just the middle class but everyone.\n\nWho were the two resisters?\n\u2022Donald Trump, the ultimate GOP nominee, who last year he didn\u2019t want to sign the Americans for Tax Reform pledge because he \"may want to switch taxes around.\" The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington says that Trump\u2019s proposals would cut federal levies on the middle one-fifth of taxpayers by .\n\u2022Jeb Bush, who said he to written pledges.\n\nWe searched debate transcripts and a variety of websites for any specific promises by Trump or Bush to shield the middle class from tax hikes, but we came up empty.\n\nWe made similar searches for the four Democrats who opposed Clinton during the primaries. While each of them spoke about the hardships facing the middle class, we found no evidence of them specifically promising to oppose tax increases on the middle class.\n\nWe asked Clinton\u2019s for an explanation of Clinton\u2019s claim and got a generic response. \"Hillary Clinton\u2019s policies, including her pledge not to raise taxes on the middle class, would build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top,\" Josh Schwerin, a campaign spokesman, replied in an email.\n\nClinton said, \"I am the only candidate who ran in either primary who said, \u2018I will not raise taxes on the middle class.\u2019\"\n\nFifteen of the 17 Republican presidential candidates signed pledges not to raise taxes on anyone, which includes the middle class. Thirteen of those candidates signed the vow last year; the other three inked such a pledge earlier in their careers.", "lang": "en"}
