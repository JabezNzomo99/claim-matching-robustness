This tweet is untrue.\n\nExamples of the claim are visible here and here .\n\nThe claim comes after Trump\u2019s visit to Mt. Rushmore in South Dakota for a pre-July 4 holiday event that drew 7,500 people, packed into an outdoor amphitheater. Many did not wear masks, defying the advice of health officials who have urged Americans to avoid large gatherings to slow the spread of COVID-19 ( here ).\n\nPosts include an image of an apparent tweet sent from Trump\u2019s official account on July 4, 2020. The full tweet reads: \u201cThank you to the Great people of South Dakota. The state is doing a tremendous job with the coronavirus. I told the governor that everyone is fine without a mask. They just need to keep there (sic) border with California closed! That state is full of LOSERS!\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence to show the tweet is legitimate. It does not appear on Trump\u2019s timeline on July 4, nor does it appear in Twitter searches for posts with this wording. No news outlets reported that Trump tweeted this on July 4.\n\nAccording to Politwoops, a project by ProPublica that archives deleted tweets from politicians, the tweet has also not been deleted from his page ( here ).\n\nTrump has given mixed messages on face masks, in contrast to the guidance from U.S. health experts on the White House coronavirus task force ( here ). After weeks of avoiding being seen wearing one in public, the U.S. President declared he was \u201call for masks\u201d at the beginning of July.\n\nReuters recently debunked other fictitious tweets attributed to Trump ( here , here and here ).\n\nFalse. Trump tweet erroneously calling for South Dakota to close its border with California is fabricated.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
