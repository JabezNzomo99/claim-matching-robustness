Let\u2019s try to analyze the claims made in the post.\n\nClaim: Modi was paying tributes to Mahatma Gandhi and also his murderer Nathuram Godse. Fact: In the picture at the bottom of the collage, Modi was paying tributes to Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. So, the claim in the post stands FALSE.\n\nOn cropping the top & bottom parts in the collage and running them through Google Reverse Image search technique, the top image was found to be taken when Modi inaugurated Mahatma Gandhi Museum at Rajkot, Gujarat. The bottom image was found to be the one taken when Narendra Modi paid tributes to Vinayak Damodar Savarkar on his 131st birth anniversary in Parliament Central Hall. The complete coverage of this event can be seen in the news video of AajTak news channel uploaded on YouTube on May 28,2014.\n\nTo sum it up, Modi wasn\u2019t paying tributes to Godse. He was offering respects to Veer Savarkar.", "lang": "en"}
