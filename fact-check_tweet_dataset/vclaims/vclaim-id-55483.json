Some of these messages also imply that this individual lost his arms in battle. The above-displayed tweet, for instance, reads: \u201cPresident Trump respectfully touches the face of a U.S veteran who lost both arms, knowing he could no longer enjoy the feel of a handshake. THIS. IS. MY. PRESIDENT. #AmericaFirst #Vets #Military #REDFRIDAY\u201d\n\nRadio personality Mark Simone also shared this image in May 2017 with the caption: \u201cHere\u2019s a powerful picture that no news outlet will publish. It took place at a Trump rally when the President met a severely wounded veteran. This soldier lost both of his arms. The feeling of a handshake is lost to him. President Trump realized this, and touched his face so he could feel the human connection.\u201d\n\nThis is a genuine photograph of Trump briefly touching the cheek of a supporter with two prosthetic arms. However, the accompanying backstory about the supporter being a veteran is inaccurate.\n\nThis photograph was taken in January 2016 during a Trump rally in Rock Hill, South Carolina, and shows a man named Henry \u201cBubba\u201d Stevenson Jr. We\u2019re not certain who took the picture. However, news outlet Online Chester published three other photographs showing the pair\u2019s meeting.\n\nWe also found a video that presumably shows the moment Trump touched the man\u2019s face:\n\nOnline Chester reported that Stevenson attended the rally in Rock Hill. Afterward, he got a chance to meet the then-presidential candidate, and Trump even autographed one of the prosthetic arms:\n\nWhile Trump did touch Stevenson\u2019s face, Stevenson is not a wounded veteran.\n\nStevenson was born without arms. According to Online Chester, his right side stops just above his elbow and on his left he has \u201conly a nub below his shoulder.\u201d A GoFundMe set up in 2014 to raise money for two bionic arms also stated that he \u201cwas born without arms\u201d and featured a photograph of him as a child.\n\nIn 2014, Online Chester published an article about him after he received his first prosthetic arm. That article goes into a little more detail about his life:\n\nFor the first time in his life, Henry \u201cBubba\u201d Stevenson Jr. can offer a handshake. But it\u2019s not your everyday handshake \u2026 it\u2019s bionic! Stevenson, 23, was fitted with a \u201c1-limb ultra bionic arm\u201d on Sept. 22. Stevenson was born without arms. On his right side, his arm stops shy of his elbow and on his left side, there is only a nub below his shoulder. As a baby, Stevenson learned to hold his bottle and feed himself using his feet and toes. As he grew up, he also used his feet and toes to feed himself and accomplish other tasks. And now for the first time, the 6-foot,1-inch tall man can hold a glass. The task is challenging but Stevenson is determined to master the skill.\n\nNone of the articles we found about him mentioned any sort of military service. At the end of the Online Chester article, Stevenson, then 23, said he wanted to \u201clearn to drive and to be more independent\u201d and had a long-term goal of getting a job.\n\nThe viral photograph of him and Trump first gained widespread attention in January 2016 after the Trump campaign posted a video touting the candidate\u2019s support of American veterans, which featured an image of Russian military ribbons. The original campaign video was deleted, and the image of the Russian ribbons was replaced with the viral photograph of Trump touching Stevenson\u2019s face. This, too, of course, was misleading, because he is not a wounded veteran.", "lang": "en"}
