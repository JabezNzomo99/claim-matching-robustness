This post has since been widely shared, with the videos being viewed hundreds of thousands of times (here).\n\nBut this post is not entirely accurate. In fact, just one of the four videos depicts a fire near the airport in Dubai that happened on August 10 at a Dubai Duty Free warehouse in the city\u2019s Umm Rammoul neighbourhood (here). The video of this fire clearly shows the warehouse (here) and can be compared with an exact location on Google Maps (here!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sOH53ueNDezZxm-em_lDTjw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656).\n\nThe other three videos in the post were not filmed on August 10 \u2013 nor were they captured in Dubai, but in Ajman, an emirate located a short distance further north.\n\nA fire broke out at a large market in an industrial area of Ajman on August 5 (here). The first video (here) was captured heading west on Sheikh Rashid Street (here!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s8BzSMSAmVJfrQix73fxiiw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656). The same is true of the second video (here), in which the brown building in the foreground on the left side can be compared with Google Maps (here!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sq9a5ByHv4zLuAWzeCRbX6A!2e0!7i13312!8i6656).\n\nIt is difficult to locate the final video in the set (here), however, it was widely shared on August 5 (here) and, therefore, could not have been taken at the same time as the August 10 fire in Dubai.\n\nPartly false. Just one video in the post depicts a recent fire at Dubai International Airport.\n\nRead more about our work to fact-check social media posts here .", "lang": "en"}
