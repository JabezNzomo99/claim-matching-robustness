The claim is false; Garrison\u2019s spokesperson told AFP the image had been manipulated from a 2016 cartoon about former US presidential candidate Hilary Clinton.\n\nThe cartoon was published in this Facebook post on July 3, 2020.\n\nIt shows several piglets labelled with the names of Indian media organisations - Aaj Tak, Sudarshan TV, Headlines Today, Times Now, ABP News, India TV and Republic TV - suckling on a mother pig, which has the caricatured face of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nThe text overlay on the top right reads \u201cLipstick on a Pig\u201d, and the bottom right carries a signature that reads \u201cBen Garrison\u201d, the name of a US-based political cartoonist.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption reads: \u201cThe entire world is aware of what\u2019s happening in India today.\"\n\nSuperimposed on the top of the image, it reads: \"American cartoonist Ben Garrison's depiction of the state of Indian media today\".\n\nThe image was also shared here and here on Facebook, and here and here on Twitter alongside a similar claim.\n\nA spokesperson for Garrison told AFP the cartoon had been \u201cdoctored\u201d.\n\nIn an email to AFP dated July 6, 2020, the spokesperson said: \u201cThe cartoon is doctored and not a Ben Garrison cartoon.
