This is not an accusation. That\u2019s an on-the-record action that they took. So if you\u2019re looking for an example of a campaign coordinating with a foreign country or a foreign source, look no further than the DNC, who actually coordinated opposition research with the Ukrainian Embassy. And no one in this room, to my knowledge, really had a big problem with that.\u201d\n\n \u2014 White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, briefing, July 10, 2017\n\nTrump consistently calls allegations about Russian interference a \u201choax,\u201d \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and \u201cfake news\u201d made up by his opponents. His White House continues to play down the allegations, now deflecting to efforts by a Ukrainian American operative to expose former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort\u2019s ties to the Russian government. In response to questions about the Trump campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia, the White House says the real story of coordination is between the Clinton campaign and Ukraine.\n\nNow we also know that during the campaign, Trump\u2019s son, son-in-law and Manafort met with a Russian lawyer who had ties to the Kremlin, with the expectation that the lawyer would provide incriminating information on Clinton as a part of the Russian government\u2019s efforts to help Trump and hurt Clinton. (We have a detailed timeline on that, too.)\n\nChalupa was hired as a consultant to the DNC during the 2016 campaign to help mobilize ethnic communities, including Ukrainian Americans. She left the DNC in July 2016, the DNC said. She continued her research into Manafort on her own, and she said she sometimes shared her findings with officials at the DNC and Clinton\u2019s campaign, Politico reported. Former Clinton campaign officials said they never received information from Chalupa.\n\nThe exact role of embassy officials is unclear. Chalupa told Politico that officials at the Ukrainian Embassy were helpful in providing guidance to her questions, and that the embassy also worked with reporters researching Trump, Manafort and Russia. A top embassy official denied working with reporters or with Chalupa on issues related to Trump or Manafort, but a former embassy officer said he was instructed to help Chalupa on her research.\n\nA key distinction is that in the Russia case, U.S. intelligence officials found a top-down effort, initiated by Putin, to illegally hack and release information in a deliberate attempt to meddle in the U.S. election and undermine the democratic system. There is no such evidence of a top-down effort in the Ukrainian case. Chalupa may have worked with some embassy officials, but there\u2019s no evidence that the DNC used information gathered by Chalupa or that the Ukrainians coordinated opposition research with the DNC.\n\nFurther, the manner in which the damaging information was obtained is different. U.S. intelligence agencies found that Putin ordered the Russian hackers who breached U.S. political organizations. In contrast, Chalupa researched Manfort on her own and without the direction of the DNC. The ledgers were public documents that were released as a part of an anti-corruption investigation by the Ukrainian government \u2014 not illegally obtained.\n\nSekulow says the Clinton campaign and Ukrainians shared information, but this is unsupported. Clinton\u2019s former campaign manager, Robby Mook, told CNN that foreign agents did not reach out to the campaign about opposition research. There is no evidence that the Clinton campaign had contacts with the Ukrainian government. Meanwhile, we have documented evidence that Trump\u2019s son, son-in-law and former campaign chairman met with a Russian lawyer in an attempt to receive opposition research that they were told was from the Russian government.\n\nThe Trump camp\u2019s role in the Russian interference in the U.S. election is still under investigation. We don\u2019t have all the details about Ukrainian ties to Chalupa or the DNC, either. What we do know so far is that there are key differences in the two situations, and it\u2019s clearly a facile comparison so far. We will not rate this comparison for now because there are too many missing details, but we will update this fact check if new information emerges.", "lang": "en"}
