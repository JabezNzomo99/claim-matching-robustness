These led to a combined total of 574 interactions and 574,241 followers as of August 12.\n\nThe claim has also been posted by two other blogs, autos.ptvbalita.com and newsupdates.altervista.org; and on dailymotion.com, a video-hosting website.\n\nOn August 7, in Malaca\u00f1ang, the President scolded 102 cops who were facing rape complaints and told them he would \u201creview\u201d their cases. He also said a \u201cspecial unit\u201d will be tasked to kill policemen involved in crime syndicates.\n\nIn fact, some of the cops allegedly urinated in front of a balete tree at the Malaca\u00f1ang grounds right after the exchange with the President. An embarrassed Philippine National Police (PNP) said it's looking into it.\n\nAnd PNP chief Oscar Albayalde did sack some police officials days after this. But those fired were not the cops who met with the President. They were the policemen assigned to Lapinig, Samar, whose police station was raided by communist rebels. The PNP also sacked Pangasinan policemen for underperforming.\n\nThe blog airph.xyz is similar to the dubious blogs that Rappler has checked. It does not have an author, company profile, editorial board, and contact details. Its posts usually do not carry any note or summary but just an embedded video from a pro-Duterte YouTube channel. \u2014 Miguel Imperial/Rappler.com\n\nIf you suspect a Facebook page, group, account, a website, or an article is spreading false information, let Rappler know by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
