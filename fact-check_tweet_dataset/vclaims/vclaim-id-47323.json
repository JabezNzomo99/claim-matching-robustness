{"title": "No, Antifa and Muslim Groups Aren't Policing Minneapolis Under 'Muslim Rule'", "subtitle": "The claim appears to have originated with a state representative who does not live in Minneapolis.", "author": "www.snopes.com", "date": "2020-06-26T09:25:00+00:00", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-47323", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/antifa-muslim-minneapolis/", "vclaim": "Antifa and Muslim organizations in summer of 2020 were planning to police the streets of Minneapolis under Muslim rule.\n\nIn late June 2020, social media users shared an article written by anti-Muslim propagandist Robert Spencer in which he claimed \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that \u201cAntifa and Muslim organizations plan to \u2018police Minneapolis under Muslim rule.'\u201d\n\nSpencer\u2019s article, which was published to the far-right website FrontPageMag, was sourced from a quote by State Rep. Steve Green, a Republican who represents a district in northwest Minnesota.\n\nGreen made the comment among many other grievances he aired during a meeting with the Hubbard County Board of Commissioners on June 16, 2020. The remark was initially documented in a Park Rapids Enterprise post written by another politician, State Rep. Matt Grossell, a Republican representative for a district in northwest Minnesota who was also present at the meeting.\n\nGrossell\u2019s post reads like a partial transcript of the two men\u2019s remarks at the meeting, and contains no corroborating evidence or reporting to support Green\u2019s claims. At one point Green indicates that in his \u201chumble opinion,\u201d they\u2019re seeing \u201ccommunism moving into Minneapolis and St. Paul.\u201d Despite a lack of evidence to support it, Green\u2019s sensational quote was picked up by a number of websites.\n\nWe reached out to Green by email to ask where he got this information and whether he had any evidence for his claims, but got no reply.\n\nWe also reached out to Minneapolis Police Sgt. John Elder, who confirmed that while the City Council did state its intent to \u201creimagine\u201d policing, the Minneapolis Police Department is still operating. \u201cWe absolutely are here and will not abandon our communities!\u201d Elder stated in an email.\n\nNot only is there no apparent evidence for Green\u2019s claim that antifa and Muslim groups are policing Minneapolis, but the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, has called on GOP leaders to repudiate Green\u2019s statement, calling it hate-filled.\n\nAs the Minneapolis-based alternate newspaper CityPages reported, the Twin Cities are no stranger to Islamophobic rhetoric and violence:\n\nIt should go without saying that, no, people are not trying to impose \u201cMuslim rule\u201d on Minneapolis, but we kind of end up having to say it a lot. Back in April, as false rumors of mosques staying open during quarantine bounced around Facebook, Council on American-Islamic Relations executive director Jaylani Hussein called the spread of such conspiracies \u201chate-bating.\u201d They might seem harlmess [sic], even laughable, until someone gets hurt. And if watching a group of Illinois men blow up a Bloomington mosque in the summer of 2017 has taught Twin Cities\u2019 Muslim communities anything, it\u2019s that they very well can.\n\nGreen\u2019s comments came in the aftermath of nationwide protests against structural racism and police violence after video of the in-custody death of George Floyd, a Black man, went viral in May 2020. The video showed Floyd begging for his life as former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck.\n\nIn the wake of sustained, international protests, Chauvin was charged with second-degree murder in Floyd\u2019s death, and three other officers at the scene were charged with aiding and abetting murder. The Minneapolis City Council also voted to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department, stating it could not be reformed.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean the police department disappeared overnight. Members of the City Council stated that the change would be gradual, and that they are still in the process of laying the groundwork for what the future holds for public safety in Minneapolis.\n\nAs some of the earlier protests had turned violent, U.S. President Donald Trump and his allies had sought to blame \u201cantifa\u201d without evidence. As The New York Times noted, \u201cantifa, a contraction of the phrase \u2018anti-fascist,\u2019 is not an organization with a leader, a defined structure or membership roles\u201d but rather \u201cantifa is more of a movement of activists whose followers share a philosophy and tactics.\u201d\n\nBecause there\u2019s no evidence for Green\u2019s comments and because the Minneapolis Police Department continues to patrol the city and respond to emergencies as city leaders hash out the future for public safety, we rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
