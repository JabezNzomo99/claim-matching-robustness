Pangilinan ordered to block comedian and host Vice Ganda from his network. This is false.\n\nIts headline, \u201cMANNY PANGILINAN PINA-BLOCK SI VICE GANDA SA BUONG TV-5 DAHIL SA PAGIGING ATTITUDE (Manny Pangilinan ordered to block Vice Ganda in the entire TV5 network because of his attitude)?!!\u201d is unfounded. There are no news reports supporting this claim.\n\nThe article\u2019s content also makes several allegations that are not backed up by its sources.\n\nThe TV5 chair has not \u201cconfirmed\u201d that a \u201csecret conversation\u201d took place between his network and Vice Ganda\u2019s camp, contrary to Showbiz Fanaticz and Duterte Squad\u2019s claims. Neither Pangilinan nor his media company, also referred to as Kapatid network, released any statement on the matter.\n\nShowbiz Fanaticz\u2019s narrator also read four paragraphs from a story by Phil News (philnews.ph). However, Phil News did not carry the same claims about Pangilinan \u201cblocking\u201d the comedian.\n\nInstead, it talked about a The Philippine Star article\u2014actually a story by tabloid Pang-masa hosted on The Philippine Star website\u2014about a \u201crumor\u201d that TV5 supposedly turned down Vice Ganda\u2019s talent fee of P3 million per show.\n\nShowbiz Fanaticz\u2019s narrator further embellished the video with this statement: \u201cAyon sa management ng Kapatid network at mismong may-ari na si Manny V. Pangilinan ay kahit anong gawin ni Vice Ganda ay \u2018di na siya tatanggapin ng Kapatid network (According to the management of the Kapatid network and even its chairman Manny V. Pangilinan himself, no matter what Vice Ganda does, he will never be accepted by the Kapatid network).\u201d This is also unsubstantiated.\n\nThe untrue story surfaced a few days after the Pang-masa article was published on July 19. However, Vice has refuted the false claims of his alleged negotiation with the network, slamming them as fake news in his post on Twitter, according to several entertainment reports.\n\nVice Ganda is a well-known talent of ABS-CBN, whose bid for a franchise renewal was denied by Congress on July 10. The shutdown of ABS-CBN\u2019s broadcast operations has caused retrenchment of some of the network\u2019s 11,000 employees.\n\nThe false story\u2019s top three traffic generators are Facebook page Duterte News Report and groups Solid Duterte Supporters Worldwide and PROTECT THE PRESIDENT DUTERTE. It could have reached 344,400 people, according to social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle.", "lang": "en"}
