The video shows a street play which portrays the murder of a journalist by RSS members in Kerala for writing against them. The play emphasizes, \u2018Silence against fascism is dangerous\u2019.\n\nThe video was first debunked by India Today on Wednesday in this article FACT CHECK: Was a Hindu woman murdered by leftists, Muslims in Kerala?\n\nThe Newsminute reports that the video was a clipping of a street play performed by the Democratic Youth Federation of India in Kalikavu in Malappuram district based on the murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh on September 5 allegedly holding RSS responsible for the murder.\n\nBelow is the video shared on twitter by a handle @AmiteshK01.\n\nThe video is being shared showing it as a real life murder caught on camera in a bid to provoke the sentiments of the Hindus against the left parties and Muslims in Kerala.\n\nGiven below is the English translation of the play in Malayalam \u2013\n\nLead Actor: She fought and stood against the RSS. Spoke against them. Atlast, she was killed by RSS. Get and tie them up.\n\nFor what? Why did you kill this poor journalist?\n\nLead Actor: Did you hear them? They who betrayed the freedom struggle, they who shot Mahatma Gandhi. They are RSS. It is dangerous. Silence is dangerous. This silence, even after fascism has entered your kitchen, is dangerous.\n\nLead Actor: RSS, who eliminated around 2000 of the minority community in the soil of Gujarat. RSS, who killed Kalburgi, Govind Pansari. RSS, who eliminates those who write and speak. They are a threat.\n\nThe video is going viral with several people sharing the video in different languages as well.\n\nBoth the handles @Amiteshk01 and @pahunji_ are followed by @PiyushGoyaloffice, one of the verified Twitter handles associated with Railway Minister Piyush Goyal.\n\nThis video has also been shared several times on Facebook since yesterday. By searching for, \u0915\u0947\u0930\u0932 \u092e\u0947\u0902 RSS \u0938\u092e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0915 \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0942 \u092e\u0939\u093f\u0932\u093e \u0915\u094b \u092e\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0932\u093f\u092e\u094b\u0902 \u0928\u0947 \u0917\u094b\u0932\u0940 \u092e\u093e\u0930\u0940...!! on Facebook you get to see various public posts sharing the video as 'the murder of RSS supporter'.\n\nSupporters from both the right wing and the left wing have blamed each other for the death of Gauri Lankesh. Activists, journalists and politicians have come under fire for blaming constitutents of the Sangh Parivar for the murder of Lankesh and linking it to the killings of rationalists Narendra Dabholkar, Govind Pansare and M. M Kalburgi in the last few years. The BJP has also sent a legal notice to historian Ramchandra Guha for linking the Sangh Parivar to Lankesh\u2019s murder in an interview to Scroll and column in the Hindustan Times.\n\nLast week, several right wing supporters were also caught on Facebook and Twitter spreading fake news that slain journalist Gauri Lankesh was in fact a Christian. They called her Gauri Lankesh \u2018Patrick\u2019, replacing Patrike which in Kannada means journal. Read our fact check on this fake news which went viral till it was debunked by fact checkers.
