The headline is inaccurate and doesn\u2019t reflect what the story actually stated.\n\nThe story said that Biden told longtime policy aides that a White House campaign in 2020 is a definite possibility, according to a report by the Associated Press.\n\nThe AP reported Feb. 18 that Biden was \"tiptoeing toward a potential presidential run in 2020, even broaching the possibility during a recent gathering of longtime foreign policy aides.\"\n\nBiden held the meeting with aides in Washington to set the agenda for the newly opened Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement.\n\nDuring the meeting, Biden \"said he was keeping his 2020 options open, considering it a real possibility. He insisted he had made no decision, and didn\u2019t need to yet, according to five people who either attended the meeting or were briefed on it by those who did,\" the AP wrote.\n\nThe AP reported that \"several people came away from the meeting with the impression that if no strong Democratic candidate emerges in the next year or so, Biden would feel strongly compelled to run.\"\n\nThe AP\u2019s sources demanded anonymity to discuss the private meeting.\n\nIn December 2017, Biden was asked on The View what it would take for him to decide to run.\n\nBiden said he hadn\u2019t organized any campaign organization, but left open the door.\n\n\"If, in a year from now, if we\u2019re ready, and no one has moved in that I think can do it, then I may very well do it,\" he said.\n\nBiden ran for president twice in the past and contemplated challenging Hillary Clinton for the 2016 nomination but ruled that out after his son Beau Biden had died from brain cancer earlier that year.", "lang": "en"}
