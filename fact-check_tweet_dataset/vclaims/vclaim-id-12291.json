Other screenshots from the video show that it is a different, much younger person, and not Ms Begum.\n\nThe video was first covered by the British press in July 2015.\n\nIn February 2015, Ms Begum, then aged 15, went to Syria with two other girls. The Home Office recently contacted her family saying it intends to remove her British citizenship.", "lang": "en"}
