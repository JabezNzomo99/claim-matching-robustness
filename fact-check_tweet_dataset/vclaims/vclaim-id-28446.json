Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nBy looking at the video, it can be observed that the police were extinguishing the fire on one side and pouring something into the bus. It is not clear from the video as to what was being poured. Some people on social media mistook it to be some fuel, which they thought was used by the Police to set the bus on fire. Even Manish Sisodia has tweeted blaming the Delhi Police. \n\n\n\nIn the video, the bus number can be seen, which is \u2018DL 1PD 0299\u2019. If the bus was burnt by the Police, then the bus should have been charred. But, in a video uploaded by \u2018India TV\u2019 on 16th December 2019 regarding the incident, the bus was found to be in the same condition as seen in the viral video. It confirms that the Police personnel were not pouring fuel on the bus and did not set fire to it later. Journalist Rahul Kanwal has also tweeted the pictures of the bus saying that \u2018the bus which Delhi Police supposedly set on fire is safe in the yard\u2019.\n\nTalking to media, the police officials Chinmoy Biswal (DCP of South-East Delhi) and Mandeep Randhawa (Delhi Police PRO) clarified that the police were just dousing the fire and have asked the people not spread the rumours.\n\nAnother tweet by Barkha Dutt which includes a video by MOJO STORY terms this as fake news. The video includes the version of the police officer in question along with the eyewitnesses version.\n\nTo sum it up, the Delhi Police personnel were not burning the bus in the viral video.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
