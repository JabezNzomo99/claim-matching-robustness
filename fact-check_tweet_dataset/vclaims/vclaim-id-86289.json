The president linked to a fake Twitter account that had been posing as another, more famous account. Within hours of Trump\u2019s tweet, the fake account and the fake quote were gone from the real Twitter. (Trump\u2019s tweet, however, remains online. It now shows the word \u201cCute!\u201d sitting atop a dead link.)\n\nAt first glance, Trump appeared to be sharing a Twitter post from the popular conservative account @ReaganBattalion. The tweet at issue had some pro-Trump commentary in addition to the fake Reagan quote: \u201cDear weak Conservatives, never forget that you are no match for \u2018we the people,\u2019 and our president.\u201d\n\nWe note that this was a February 2017 tweet that somehow wound up on the president\u2019s Twitter feed more than two years later. Upon close inspection, it wasn\u2019t from the real Reagan Battalion account, but from an impostor deftly trying to trick Twitter users by spelling the word battalion with a capital I instead of a lowercase L. (Can you spot the difference between \u201c@ReaganBattalion\u201d and \u201c@ReaganBattaIion\u201d?)\n\n\u201cA review of every Trump mention in the Reagan files shows that White House aides spent much of the 1980s trying to gently reject the mogul\u2019s self-aggrandizing overtures without bruising that \u2018large ego\u2019 of his,\u201d Hohmann reported. One example: \u201cBack in 1983, Trump snagged a picture with the president during a photo line at a White House event. The president, not paying close attention, signed it \u2018Reagan Reagan.\u2019 Five years later, Trump included the image in his book \u2018The Art of the Deal.\u2019 An aide in the social secretary\u2019s office noticed the mistake. She sent an apologetic note and a corrected picture \u2014 signed with an autopen.\u201d\n\nThe president or someone managing his Twitter account later Monday morning began to retweet Trump-cheering posts from the real @ReaganBattalion. Those tweets also had photos . . . of the crowd size and festivities at the Fourth of July event Trump held at the Lincoln Memorial. The real @ReaganBattalion account tweeted Monday, \u201cwe are right here, the account that was suspended was impersonating us.\u201d\n\nWithin hours of Trump\u2019s tweet, the account that had been posing as @ReaganBattalion was taken offline and appeared to have been suspended by Twitter. Its tweets now show up as dead links.\n\nWhat a mess! Trump shared a real photo of himself with Reagan, but Reagan\u2019s quote was fabricated (and way over the top). Fact-checkers had debunked this meme in the months and years before Trump\u2019s tweet.\n\nTrump retweeted this quote, and we usually don\u2019t fact-check politicians based on what they retweet. However this phony quote wound up on the president\u2019s Twitter feed, the bottom line is that Reagan never lavished Trump with this type of praise.\n\nPerhaps Trump believed otherwise. Perhaps he couldn\u2019t tell that he was retweeting an impostor. That raises a separate concern. The president should vet more carefully what he shares on Twitter, especially when his administration is raising the alarm about the spread of misinformation online. Compounding the problem, Trump failed to provide a clarification or correction once the Reagan quote he tweeted was debunked again as a total fabrication.", "lang": "en"}
