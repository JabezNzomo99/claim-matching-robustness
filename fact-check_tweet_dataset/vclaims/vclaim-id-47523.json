Bernie Sanders suggested that the Trump administration is responsible for the production of coronavirus commemorative coins:\n\nThe coins are being sold for $100\u2014they normally sell for $125 but are currently on sale\u2014by a company called the White House Gift Shop. Sen. Sanders linked to a Daily Beast article that notes the White House Gift Shop is \u201cprivately-run,\u201d but the lack of further detail and articles on other websites that don\u2019t include that distinction have led some to believe, like the senator, that the White House itself is behind the commemorative coins.\n\nThe entity responsible for the coins\u2019 production is not, despite its name, affiliated with the White House. The White House Gift Shop\u2019s website explains that the shop was established in 1946 by President Harry Truman to raise funds for the families of injured or deceased Secret Service agents, but that \u201cIn 2012, the Secret Service Fund's Board Members, nine in all, met and voted unanimously to transfer not only control but permanent rights, succession history, and ownership of The White House Gift Shop to Giannini Strategic, LLC.\u201d The United States Patent and Trademark Office\u2019s records confirm that the terms \u201cWhite House Gift Shop\u201d and \u201cWhite House Gift Shop, Est. 1946\u201d are both trademarked by Giannini Strategic, LLC.\n\nThe history of the White House Gift Shop is difficult to confirm\u2014Josh Marshall, the editor of the left-leaning Talking Points Memo, attempted to dig into it in 2018 and was able to uncover some information, but the store\u2019s background is still murky. Neither the White House Gift Shop nor the Department of Homeland Security, which houses the Secret Service, responded to requests for comment, but even based on what little information is available, it\u2019s clear that the White House Gift Shop is not a government entity and that Sen. Sanders' tweet on the subject is misleading.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
