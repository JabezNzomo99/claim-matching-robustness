Nothing in the transcript shows that Soros \u201chailed\u201d the COVID-19 pandemic, saw \u201cbig opportunities\u201d from it, or was \u201call but salivating over the chance to remake society.\u201d\n\nThe interviewer, writer Gregor Peter Schmitz, asked Soros: \u201cYou have seen many crises. Is the COVID-19 pandemic comparable to any previous one?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. This is the crisis of my lifetime,\u201d Soros replied. \u201cEven before the pandemic hit, I realized that we were in a revolutionary moment where what would be impossible or even inconceivable in normal times had become not only possible, but probably absolutely necessary. And then came COVID-19, which has totally disrupted people\u2019s lives and required very different behavior. It is an unprecedented event that probably has never occurred in this combination. And it really endangers the survival of our civilization.\u201d\n\nIn its headline, RT quotes Soros as saying in the interview that \u201cEverything\u2019s up for grabs.\u201d The quote is altered and taken out of context. It came in the following exchange:\n\nGREGOR PETER SCHMITZ: \u201cWill this crisis change the nature of capitalism? Even before COVID-19 led to the current catastrophic recession, the downsides of globalization and free trade were attracting greater attention.\u201d\n\nSOROS: \u201cWe will not go back to where we were when the pandemic started. That is pretty certain. But that is the only thing that is certain. Everything else is up for grabs. I do not think anybody knows how capitalism will evolve.\u201d\n\nRather than \u201cbig opportunities,\u201d Soros reflected on an uncertain future for global capitalism.\n\nRT\u2019s Twitter post linking to the story erroneously suggested that Soros was laughing like a villain at the COVID-19 pandemic. The tweet reads:\n\nIt should be noted that RT published its article on the Soros interview in its World News section, not its opinion section.\n\nGeorge Soros is a Hungarian-born billionaire investor whose donations to political candidates and funding of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) has often earned the ire of politicians and regimes in many countries.\n\nIn 2015, Russia banned two of his organizations, the Open Society Foundations and the Open Society Institute Assistance Foundation, labeling them \u201cundesirable organizations\u201d under a law passed earlier that same year. A Russian court claimed the NGOs represented \u201ca threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the Russian Federation and the security of the state.\u201d\n\nSoros\u2019 support for Democratic party candidates in the U.S. has also earned him ire in that country, where he has increasingly been portrayed as a mastermind behind various conspiracy theories. Due to his background in finance and Jewish heritage, Soros has become a prime target for anti-Semitic conspiracy theories among extreme right-wing groups both in the United States and throughout the world.", "lang": "en"}
