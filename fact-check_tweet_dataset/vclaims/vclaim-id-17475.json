Well, social media would certainly have us believe so. A video of some hooligans smashing a blue-coloured bus has been going viral with the claim that it is the doing of some auto-rickshaw drivers in the Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) area of Mumbai.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the video is not from Mumbai but from Surat.\n\nFacebook user Nirmal Thakur uploaded a post in which a large mob of Muslim men can be seen vandalising buses. A few people from the community are seen trying to stop the miscreants along with some policemen too. Along with the post, Thakur wrote, \"Oppose of bus route started to Bandra to BKC by Muslim Rikshawala\u2019s running share riksha.\" This post has been shared by a few Facebook users and the archived version of this post can be seen here.\n\nSimilarly, few Twitter users too shared the same video saying that this video is from Bandra East, BKC area. This video has been viral on Whatsapp too with the same claim.\n\nAFWA looked at the video closely and found that the name \"sitilink\" is written on the side of one of the blue buses that are getting vandalised. Typing sitilink on internet leads to various links related to the Surat Municipal Corporation. Sitilink is a transportation project of the municipal corporation of Surat under the Smart City project.\n\nAFWA then searched the internet to see if there had been any protests by members of the Muslim community in Surat and found that on July 5, there was a protest at Swami Vivekanand Circle, Nanpura area of the city. This protest was against the recent mob lynching in Jharkhand. The protest got out of hand when a large number of people took to the street and it was during this protest that the buses were vandalised. News about this can be read here. The same buses damaged by the mob in the viral video can be seen in a news clipping about the incident.\n\nThe advertising posters \"Shah\" which can be seen in the video can be seen in the Google Instant Street View as well.\n\nThere have been media reports of hooliganism about auto-rickshaw drivers of BKC but no such incident of vandalism of buses was reported in Mumbai by the local police.", "lang": "en"}
