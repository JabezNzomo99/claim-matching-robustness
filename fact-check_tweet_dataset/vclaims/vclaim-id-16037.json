Aligarh SP Atul Srivastava later refuted that the encounters were stage-managed.\n\nThe police had claimed that the slain youths were booked for six murders on September 18 and had since been absconding. During interception two days later, they allegedly began shooting at the cops, triggering a crossfire and their eventual death in an encounter. Family members, however, gave a vastly different version of events, claiming that the two youths were picked up from home on September 16 and later killed by the police. They also said that Naushad was a 17-year-old minor.\n\nActivists, journalists and student leaders of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) and Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), including Umar Khalid, visited the kin of the deceased on September 27 to investigate the encounters. The following day, several media outlets reported that Khalid was involved in abducting family members of the alleged criminals.\n\nDainik Jagranwas among the firsts to make the claim. The title of its report reads \u2013 \u201cUmar Khalid involved in kidnapping the mother of a famous criminal, several JNU student leaders also accused (translated)\u201d \u2013 however, the article fails to mention anything about the complaint filed against Khalid.\n\nWhile describing Khalid\u2019s meeting with the kin of the deceased, Dainik Jagran reported,\u201c\u0926\u093f\u0932\u094d\u0932\u0940 \u0938\u0947 \u092f\u0942\u0928\u093e\u0907\u091f\u0947\u0921 \u0905\u0917\u0947\u0902\u0938\u094d\u091f \u0939\u0947\u091f \u0915\u0940 \u091f\u0940\u092e \u0915\u0947 \u0928\u0926\u0940\u092e, \u0905\u092c\u094d\u0926\u0941\u0932 \u092e\u093e\u091c\u093f\u0926, \u0909\u092e\u0930 \u0916\u093e\u0932\u093f\u0926 \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u090f\u090f\u092e\u092f\u0942 \u0938\u0947 \u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0935 \u091b\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0938\u0902\u0918 \u0905\u0927\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0937 \u092e\u0936\u0915\u0942\u0930 \u0905\u0939\u092e\u0926 \u0909\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0940, \u092b\u0948\u091c\u0941\u0932 \u0939\u0938\u0928 \u0935 \u0935\u093e\u092e\u092a\u0902\u0925\u0940 \u0928\u0947\u0924\u093e \u0930\u0902\u091c\u0928 \u0930\u093e\u0928\u093e \u092e\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0915\u0940\u092e \u0935 \u0928\u094c\u0936\u093e\u0926 \u0915\u0947 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u091c\u0928\u094b\u0902 \u0938\u0947 \u092e\u093f\u0932\u0928\u0947 \u092a\u0939\u0941\u0902\u091a\u0947 \u0925\u0947\u0964 (\u2018United Against Hate\u2019 activist Nadeem, along with Abdul Majid, Umar Khalid, AMUSU President Maskoor Usmani, Faizul Hasan and leftist leader Ranjan Rana met the families of Mustaqeem and Naushad.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u092e\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0915\u0940\u092e \u0915\u0940 \u092a\u0924\u094d\u0928\u0940 \u0939\u093f\u0928\u093e \u0928\u0947 \u092e\u0936\u0915\u0942\u0930, \u092b\u0948\u091c\u0941\u0932 \u0938\u092e\u0947\u0924 \u0938\u092d\u0940 \u092a\u0930 \u091c\u092c\u0930\u0928 \u0938\u093e\u0938 \u0936\u092c\u093e\u0928\u093e \u0935 \u0928\u094c\u0936\u093e\u0926 \u0915\u0940 \u092e\u093e\u0902 \u0936\u093e\u0939\u0940\u0928 \u0915\u094b \u0932\u0947 \u091c\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0940 \u0930\u093f\u092a\u094b\u0930\u094d\u091f \u0926\u0930\u094d\u091c \u0915\u0930\u093e\u0908 \u0939\u0948\u0964 (Mustaqeem\u2019s wife Heena lodged a report against Maskoor, Faizul and everyone else on charges of forcefully taking her mother-in-law Shabana and Naushad\u2019s mother Shaheen),\u201d it further added, without explicitly reiterating that Khalid was involved in the abduction.\n\nIn a report titled, \u201cJNU student Umar Khalid accused of kidnapping criminal\u2019s mother;

(Umar Khalid was also present among the activists, however, his name is not mentioned in the complaint.)\u201d\n\nThe first paragraph of the article had implied that JNU student leaders were involved in the abduction and the title suggested a serious allegation against Khalid. However, the subsequent paragraph of the report failed to state the exact role of Khalid or any other JNU student leaders in the abduction.\n\nFurthermore, in contrast to Dainik Jagran\u2019s report which claimed that a complaint was filed by Mustakeem\u2019s wife Heena, Zee News added that Bajrang Dal Secretary Ram Kumar co-authored the written complaint \u2013 \u201c\u0924\u0939\u0930\u0940\u0930 \u092c\u091c\u0930\u0902\u0917 \u0926\u0932 \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u091a\u093f\u0935 \u0930\u093e\u092e \u0915\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0930 \u0906\u0930\u094d\u092f \u0914\u0930 \u092e\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0915\u0940\u092e \u0915\u0940 \u092a\u0924\u094d\u0928\u0940 \u0939\u093f\u0928\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u0913\u0930 \u0938\u0947 \u0926\u0940 \u0917\u0908 \u0925\u0940.\u201d\n\nSeveral other media outlets report \u201c10 activists\u201d booked under abduction charges\n\nApart from the aforementioned claims suggesting that Umar Khalid was booked for abducting the kin of the deceased, several mainstream media outlets contrastingly reported that \u201c10 activists\u201d were booked in the case. Among them was The Times of India, The Week, Scroll, Outlook, News18, The Hinduand NDTV. All the reports were attributed to PTI.\n\nAccording to the reports, \u201cThe controversy over the alleged fake encounter of two suspected criminals here took a new twist on Friday with the police booking 10 activists, including Aligarh Muslim University and Jawaharlal Nehru University student leaders, saying they had abducted family members of one of the deceased.\u201d The case was registered in Atrauli police station.\n\nThe reports further added, \u201cThe activists have been charged with abducting Mustakeem\u2019s mother Shabana and grandmother Rafiquan.\u201d Interestingly, The Times of Indiapublished another report on September 29, claiming that the mothers were kidnapped \u2013 \u201cAMU students booked for abducting mothers of two criminals killed in police encounter.\u201d\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nAlt News contacted SHO Atrauli Police Parvesh Rana who said, \u201cA case has been filed by Mustaqeem\u2019s wife Heena who has named AMU students Maskoor Usmani and Faizul Hasan in the FIR for abducting the criminals\u2019 mothers Shaheen and Shabana.\u201d\n\nIn the FIR copy accessed by Alt News, the names of the accused persons match. The complaint, filed under Heena\u2019s name on September 27, claims that seven to eight people entered her home and forcefully abducted her mother-in-law Shabana (Mustaqeem\u2019s mother) and Shaheen (Naushad\u2019s mother). The landlord Imran, mother-in-law Rafiquan and an individual named Nafees were eyewitnesses to the kidnapping, according to the FIR. It further adds that Shabana dialled 100 at around 2 pm and informed the police of her abduction.\n\nAlt News spoke with both Usmani and Hasan, the accused in this case, who claimed that the FIR was false as Heena was coerced into lodging the complaint. They alleged that her thumb impression was taken under false pretences.\n\nWe also contacted Umar Khalid who reiterated the same and said that the mothers of deceased had come with them on free will.\n\nWhen Alt News spoke with Shabana (Mustaqeem\u2019s mother) and Shaheen (Naushad\u2019s mother), they echoed Khalid\u2019s statements. \u201cWe just want justice for our sons,\u201d they repeated multiple times. Both women said that they were not abducted but made the decision to accompany Khalid and the others on their own accord.\n\nWhen the SHO of Atrauli police station was asked if the mothers were contacted for their versions of the story, Parvesh Rana said they were unable to get in touch with the women as the police were unaware of their whereabouts. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where Shabhana and Shaheen have been kept, and in what conditions,\u201d SHO Rana told Alt News.\n\nIn sharp contrast to the claims made in the FIR and the police\u2019s statements, both the women who were allegedly \u2018abducted\u2019 can be seen addressing a press conference held in Delhi on September 29. This was two days after the FIR was filed. The women addressed the media, with their alleged abductees also a part of the event.\n\n\u201cThe police picked up our boys from home and beat them up. Later, when we were asked to visit them at the hospital, our sons were dead. The police raided our homes, took our money and all documents,\u201d said Shabana in presence of Khalid, Usmani and Hasan.\n\nWhile the case pertains to an ongoing criminal investigation, the issue of concern is the manner in which it was reported. The titles of several media reports portrayed Umar Khalid as involved in the abduction, while the articles failed to establish the same. The former JNU student enjoys a significant political presence and the misleading reportage points to the apparent use of a familiar name to garner an audience.\n\nFurthermore, while AMU student leaders Maskoor Ahmad Usmani and Faizul Hasan are co-accused in the FIR, they can both be seen with their alleged abductees in a public forum. An investigation into their indictment is pending and in such situations, presenting information of an underdeveloped story in an incomplete and misleading fashion amounts to irresponsible journalism.", "lang": "en"}
