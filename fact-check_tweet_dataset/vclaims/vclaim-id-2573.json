At the time, Bill Clinton was U.N. special envoy to Haiti and Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.\n\nThe report by ABC News does show that there was close cooperation between the foundation and the State Department. However, the emails do not provide any evidence that the State Department helped the Clintons\u2019 friends or foundation donors obtain recovery contracts.\n\nWe first heard Pence, Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, make his claim about disaster-related contracts in Haiti when he was interviewed by NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d host Chuck Todd.\n\nA day later, Pence told supporters at a rally in Mason, Ohio, a similar story of the ABC News report.\n\nABC News wrote a story on Oct. 11 called \u201c\u2018FOBs\u2019: How Hillary\u2019s State Dept. Gave Special Attention to \u2018Friends of Bill\u2019 After Haiti Quake.\u201d The story was based on \u201cdozens of emails\u201d obtained by the Republican National Committee through a Freedom of Information Act request. The network\u2019s investigative unit highlighted several of the emails in its story that were sent from the Clinton Foundation to the State Department regarding Friends of Bill (FOB).\n\nIn addition to being the U.N. special envoy to Haiti, Bill Clinton was also co-chairman with then-Haiti Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive of the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission, and joined with former President George H.W. Bush to form the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund within days of the earthquake.\n\nABC News reported that FOBs and Clinton Foundation donors contacted the foundation to offer help or seek assistance in the immediate aftermath of the January 2010 earthquake. The Clinton Foundation forwarded some of those requests to the State Department. For example, the foundation forwarded an email to Caitlin Klevorick \u2014 a State Department employee who once worked for the Clinton Foundation \u2014 from a woman who was offering medical supplies, ABC News reported.\n\nKlevorick responds: \u201cIs this a FOB! If not, she should go to cidi.org,\u201d referring to a USAID website set up for people who want to make a donation to help with international disasters.\n\nThere is no disputing that the State Department did assist those connected to the Clinton Foundation \u201cduring the hours after the massive 2010 Haiti earthquake,\u201d as ABC News reported.\n\nBut the news story does not provide any evidence that State Department officials \u201cdirected contracts for the Haitian recovery effort \u2026 to friends of the Clintons,\u201d as Pence claimed.\n\nAnd the State Department says it found \u201cno evidence\u201d that its staff helped foundation donors or Bill Clinton\u2019s friends obtain contracts.\n\nAt an Oct. 11 press briefing, State Department spokesman John Kirby said the State Department \u201clooked into\u201d allegations of preferential treatment to contractors \u201cwhen ABC was working this story.\u201d He said, \u201cWe found no evidence that preferential treatment was given to any particular entity or organization with respect to contracts.\u201d\n\nIn its report, ABC News mentioned two companies by name that had ties to the Clinton Foundation. Both had operations in Haiti, and they were in position to help with the rescue effort or in need of assistance themselves.\n\nHere are the two companies and a short recap of what help they were seeking or assistance they were offering, based on the ABC News report and our own reporting:\n\nThe CEO of Digicel is Denis O\u2019Brien, whom ABC News identifies as \u201ca longtime donor to the Clinton Foundation.\u201d O\u2019Brien gave between $10 million and $25 million to the foundation.\n\nDigicel was seeking help \u201cto fly relief supplies into Port-au-Prince and get employees of his company out,\u201d at the same time that the U.S. Army was seeking its help in restoring communications in Haiti, the news report said. O\u2019Brien sought help from the Clinton Foundation because his company was having problems getting \u201clanding slots\u201d at an airport in Haiti, and the Clinton Foundation sought the State Department\u2019s assistance in helping O\u2019Brien, according to ABC News.\n\nO\u2019Brien told ABC News: \u201cI don\u2019t see any problem contacting anybody in the United States if I\u2019m bringing in emergency aid where people are dying on the street because of lack of medical attention. I make no apologies for that.\u201d\n\nThere is no question that O\u2019Brien is deeply involved in the Clinton Foundation and Haiti recovery projects. We found that O\u2019Brien became chairman of the foundation\u2019s Haiti Action Network in 2009 a few months before the earthquake, and served in that capacity for at least four years. After the 2010 earthquake, O\u2019Brien was involved in commercial development projects \u2014 including restoring the Iron Market and building a new Marriott, both in Port-au-Prince. The Clinton Foundation said that it \u201cfacilitated\u201d the agreement between Marriott and Digicel for construction of the hotel, which opened in 2015.\n\nBut the ABC News report contained no evidence that Digicel or O\u2019Brien received any contracts for disaster recovery work in Haiti because of O\u2019Brien\u2019s ties to the Clinton Foundation.\n\nABC News also reported that Garry Mauro, \u201cwho served twice as the Texas state chairman for Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaigns and has donated $25,000 to $50,000 to the Clinton Foundation,\u201d wrote to Amitabh Desai of the Clinton Foundation on behalf of a client, DRC Emergency Services. Mauro wrote that DRC had \u201cmajor assets in Haiti\u201d and was ready to help in the recovery. Desai forwarded the email to Klevorick at the State Department, noting that Mauro is a friend of Bill Clinton\u2019s, ABC News reported.\n\nABC News writes that the \u201cemail chain does not indicate if Mauro\u2019s recommendation led to a contract for DRC.\u201d Mauro told ABC News that the company wanted to do business in Haiti, but he did not know if it received any disaster-related contracts. ABC News spoke to a company official who said that those familiar with the firm\u2019s work in Haiti were no longer with the company.\n\nWe spoke to Robert J. Isakson Sr., a co-founder of DRC Emergency Services and managing director of the company at the time of the firm\u2019s work in Haiti. He told us that his former company (which he said he sold in 2013) had done work for years with the U.S. Army, dating to Desert Storm when President George H.W. Bush was in office. According to its website, DRC also built a 350-person compound in Port-au-Prince to support the U.S. Embassy in 2006, when President George W. Bush was president. DRC not only built the compound, but operated it as well.\n\nWhen the earthquake hit, Isakson said DRC Emergency Services had personnel in place to assist in the recovery and flew in more workers to help.\n\nAn Alabama newspaper on Feb. 14, 2010 \u2013 just about a month after the earthquake \u2013 wrote that DRC was in Haiti \u201cproviding body recovery and demolition services, as well as sanitation and toilets for various aid organizations.\u201d It also helped fly emergency personnel, such as doctors, to Haiti for free.\n\nIsakson told us that the company received about $10 million in disaster-related contracts in Haiti, but without any help from the State Department or the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission that Bill Clinton co-chaired. Instead, the company used its U.S. Army contacts to obtain quick approval for recovery work in Haiti, but that work lasted only a few months, Isakson said.\n\n\u201cWe had done a lot of work with the U.S. military,\u201d Isakson recalled. \u201cThey have pre-event contracts. We hunted down their pre-event contractors and we showed them we were already prepared \u2014 we were ready \u2014 so they hired us.\u201d (Pre-event contracts are established before a disaster strikes in order to expedite recovery efforts.)\n\nThe U.S. Army hired DRC to do demolition work at the Hotel Montana, as well as toilet and sanitation work and construction of a temporary camp for military and civilian personnel, he said.\n\n\u201cWe picked up the toilet program, and camps for the military and private people there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe may have done $10 million of work. It should have done half a billion.\u201d\n\nIsakson said the company bid on other jobs, but was unsuccessful.\n\n\u201cWe never met with the State Department,\u201d Isakson said. Asked about the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission, Isakson told us, \u201cWe got nothing from those guys.\u201d\n\nWe note that ABC News also mentioned in its story on FOBs that the State Department fielded a direct request for assistance from Rolando Gonzalez-Bunster, a board member of the Clinton Foundation and chairman and CEO of InterEnergy, which generates and distributes power in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nABC News said Bunster sought the State Department\u2019s help in obtaining \u201cdetailed satellite imagery of the Haitian power grid after the earthquake to help \u2018do a reconnaissance of the status of the transmission and distribution lines and power plants.'\u201d\n\nBut, again, ABC News did not report that Bunster or his company received a contract. \u201cBunster told ABC News the grid work was a donation and later garnered his company an award for its efforts,\u201d the story said.\n\nContrary to Pence\u2019s claim, ABC News did not report, and the emails obtained through the RNC\u2019s FOIA request did not show, any evidence that Hillary Clinton\u2019s aides at the State Department \u201cdirected contracts for the Haitian recovery effort \u2026 to friends of the Clintons.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
