This is false.\n\nThe post (here) came as British media reported London Tube lines were busy after Prime Minister Boris Johnson encouraged people to return to work if they could not work from home (here).\n\nThe post contains six photographs of commuters crowding outside Brixton station in south London. It was shared on May 13 with the caption: \u201cThis is just some of our train stations this morning...just some! After being told by BJ to go to work if you can go to work, but DON\u2019T take London Transport, walk or ride a blasted BIKE!\u201d\n\nThe caption is inaccurate. The photographs can all be traced to articles or social media posts published long before May 13. The first image, for instance, appears in a Reddit post on January 10, 2019 with the caption: \u201cBrixton tube this morning...\u201d (here)\n\nThe second photo, according to a reverse image search, was first published by the Evening Standard on December 13, 2016. The article states that the photo shows overcrowding at Brixton station after the underground was suspended(here) .\n\nThe third photo has a watermark that credits the image to \u201cJoe Newman / SWNS.com\u201d. The same photograph, with the same watermark, was published by the Daily Mail on January 26, 2017 with the caption: \u201cCrowds of people queue at Brixton Underground station as rail staff walk out on another strike\u201d (here) (here).\n\nThe fourth photo appears in an article by the Evening Standard on February 11, 2020. The article states the photo shows \u201ccrowds outside Brixton Station this morning\u201d after a faulty train caused severe delays. The image is credited to Twitter user AlintheaYoh who uploaded the photo on the morning on February 11 (here) (here).\n\nWhile the exact date the fifth photograph was taken is not clear, an early public iteration can be traced to Twitter user \u201c_Preeya_\u201d, who published the photo on November 14, 2014 with the caption: \u201cNot today #brixton\u201d (here) .\n\nThe final photo was published by both the Evening Standard and City AM on October 12, 2018. The Evening Standard article claims the photo shows: \u201cCrowds outside Brixton station on Friday morning\u201d following delays to the tube network (here).\n\nFalse. The photographs are old and were taken long before May 13.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Read more about our work to fact-check social media posts here.", "lang": "en"}
