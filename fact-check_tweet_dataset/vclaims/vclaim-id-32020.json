The same footage of the collapse is repeated four times in the video.\n\nThe post\u2019s Chinese language caption translates to English as: \u201cAnother shoddy project!\u201d\n\nPart of the simplified Chinese captions superimposed on the video translate to English as: \u201cCountry Garden\u2019s building in Lanzhou caused 76 deaths\u201d; \u201cCountry Garden\u2019s building in Lanzhou is now a top news\u201d; \u201cDeep thoughts after an apartment building from Lanzhou collapses\u201d; \u201cThis is a video showing Country Garden\u2019s building in Lanzhou collapsing as a whole with 76 deaths\u201d.\n\nLanzhou is the capital city of the northwest Chinese province of Gansu.\n\nThe same video was also published on YouTube here, here and here; and Twitter here and here, also here on Weibo, with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the video has circulated in media reports since 2017 about a planned building demolition in a different Chinese city; nobody was reported to have died.\n\nA keyword search found this November 13, 2017 Weibo post published by the verified account of Network Security Detachment of Public Security Bureau in Baoding.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe post includes the same video of the building collapse.\n\nThe simplified Chinese language caption translates to English as: \u201cAn 18-Storey illegal building near Qiezhuang, Baoding was demolished in seven seconds.\n\n\u201cAfter several days of demolition, on November 8, an 18-storey building near Qiezhuang, West Third Ring of Baoding City eventually collapsed. This is the largest single building demolished since Baoding started demolishing illegal construction this year. @\u9f99\u534e\u5f00\u5fc3\u4ed6\u7238 please learn about this.\u201d\n\nBelow are three screenshot comparisons of the video in the misleading posts (L) and the Weibo post published by Baoding\u2019s public security bureau (R):\n\nBaoding\u2019s public security bureau account also published this video showing the same building, filmed from a different angle, two days earlier.\n\nCentral Hebei Editorial Department of Hebei Youth Daily, Hebei\u2019s local official media reported the demolition on Weibo here on November 8, 2019, with a video depicting the building from different angles.\n\nThe post\u2019s simplified Chinese language caption translates to English in part as: \u201cAfter that, our journalist interviewed the Law Enforcement Bureau of Jingxiu District, Baoding City, and the representative confirmed with our journalist that the building was demolished in the afternoon of November 8, 2019 at 16:46, and that person briefly introduced the process of the demolition.\n\n\u201cAccording to the representative, professional demolition company was asked to be involved. And first of all, the structure of the building should be cleaned up until the main load-bearing pillars are left, then the direction and scope of dumping would be calculated. And after the load-bearing pillars are precisely cut by professional equipment, the building could collapse towards one direction, which is similar to directional blasting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s acknowledged that the 18-storey high building is located in Xuzhuang Village, Jiangcheng Country, Jingxiu District, west of the Third Ring, and is named Huafu Zhiyuan. The record shows that the residential estate was developed and constructed by Xuzhuang Village Committee in Jiangcheng Country, without any relevant procedures. From November 3, the relevant departments started to demolish this building.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Weibo post:\n\nThe building was located here according to Baidu maps.\n\nAn earlier November 4, 2019 demolition Weibo post by the same official media account can be seen here, mentioning the same building demolition in the caption that goes partly as: \u201cOn November 4, journalist saw on the demolition scene that the 18-storey building has been finished in its main part, without outside decoration. An excavator was demolishing the first to fifth floors of the building. It is estimated that the demolition area will be about 30,000 square meters.\u201d The third picture contained in the post shows the according scene.\n\nBelow is the third picture from the November 4 Weibo post:\n\nThe misleading video has been previously debunked by Chinese fact checking media platform such as Jiaozhen and Shanghai Network Fact Check here and here, and regional news sites in China such as Linhai Online here.", "lang": "en"}
