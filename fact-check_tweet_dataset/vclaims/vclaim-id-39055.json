We are born \u2018BJPwallah\u2019. My father was in Jan Sangh. He went to jail during the emergency.\u201d One Twitter user Ajay posted the clip along with the message, \u201cDoes anybody need further proof of Kejriwal\u2019s RSS roots?\u201d On the basis of the supposed admission, he emphasised that every vote for Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the recently-concluded Delhi assembly election can be counted as a vote for the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). The clip is being passed off as proof that Kejriwal admitted that his family has links with the RSS.\n\nAlt News has also received a request on its official mobile application to fact-check the video.\n\nAlt News found that the 7-second clip has been lifted from a February 2020 interview of Kejriwal with NDTV where he claimed that he was quoting a BJP supporter. The Delhi chief minister did not accept that his family has RSS roots.\n\nAt 7:15 minutes in the video posted below, Kejriwal can be heard saying, \u201cI saw a \u2018BJPwallah\u2019 who was speaking on a channel. He said, \u2018Our family was of the Jan Sangh Parivar. We are born \u2018BJPwallah\u2019. My father was in Jan Sangh. He went to jail during the emergency but this time I will vote for Kejriwal\u2019.\u201d\n\nContinuing with the man\u2019s story, Kejriwal said, \u201cBut then he [the supporter] was asked why so? He said \u2018My child studies in a government school and the school used to be in such bad condition. They have improved my child\u2019s future. He said, \u2018[Kejriwal] is the only guy who is asking for votes on the basis of his work. In 70 years, no [party] has asked for votes on the basis of their work'\u201d.\n\nHe further quotes the BJP supporter\u2019s response to the anchor\u2019s query on Shaheen Bagh and said, \u201cI have been in the BJP. I know their politics. They made this 10-day issue and they have created this Shaheen Bagh. In ten days, after the election, Shaheen Bagh will get over. After that only Kejriwal will be of use for our electricity, water, hospital and school\u201d.\n\nA 7-second clip was circulated on social media to falsely claim that Kejriwal admitted of having family links with the RSS. However, the Delhi chief minister claimed that he was quoting a BJP supporter talking about voting for AAP on the basis of their work.", "lang": "en"}
