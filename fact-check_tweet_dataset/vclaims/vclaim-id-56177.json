Hydroxychloroquine was not listed as one of the components.\n\nThis was further confirmed on official websites of other sources \u2013 the chemical composition does not state Hydroxychloroquine.\n\nWe also checked the WHO website for cures of Coronavirus, and it reiterated that there is no cure for COVID-19.\n\nHence, it is false and Kalonji seeds do not contain hydroxychloroquine and will not aid in the prevention of the Coronavirus.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
