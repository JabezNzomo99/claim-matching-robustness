He doesn\u2019t have a Twitter account, and likewise the tweet wasn\u2019t sent from the account of Fox News Sunday, the news show he anchors.\n\nTrump was indeed unhappy with Wallace over an interview with U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., about the ongoing impeachment hearings against the president. Trump has been accused by a whistleblower of attempting to extort damaging information from Ukraine about a political rival by withholding crucial military aid. Wallace had challenged Scalise, a defender of Trump, on several points. The interview can be viewed here:\n\nBoth Wallace and Trump are the sons of prominent fathers. Wallace is the son of the late CBS \u201c60 Minutes\u201d journalist Mike Wallace, while Trump\u2019s father, Fred Trump, was a prolific developer who was responsible for building the Trump family\u2019s real estate empire.", "lang": "en"}
