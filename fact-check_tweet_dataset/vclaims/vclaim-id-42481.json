Let\u2019s check the authenticity of the claim in the message.\n\n\n\nClaim: BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike) will be spraying medicine in the air after 10 PM tonight in order to kill COVID-19. Fact: The BBMP Commissioner and the Mayor have clarified that the message is just a rumor and the BBMP has no such plans to spray any medicine for COVID-19.

In his tweet, B.H. Anil Kumar (Commissioner of BBMP) has said that the message is just a rumour and the BBMP has no plans to spray any medicine for COVID-19. The same can also be found in a tweet by BBMP Mayor M. Goutham Kumar. \n\n\n\nWhen a similar message went viral across the country saying that the Government of India will spray Coronavirus vaccine gas, the Press Information Bureau (PIB) has debunked the claim and clarified that the Government is doing no such thing and the message is \u2018fake\u2019.\n\nAlso, when a similar message went viral in Oman saying that the Government of Oman is spraying Coronavirus pesticide in the country to combat the spread of COVID-19, the Ministry of Health (Oman) has said that it is a rumour and no such operation is planned.\n\nTo sum it up, the message that BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike) will be spraying medicine in the air to kill COVID-19 is just a rumour. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
