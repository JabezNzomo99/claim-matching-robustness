In the piece, titled \u201cBeware of Homemade Slime,\u201d the author recounted how her daughter had come down with a series of symptoms, including headache and respiratory problems, with no clear cause. But when they removed all the slime and slime-related products from their house, however, her daughter immediately became healthy:\n\nIf you have elementary age kids, you are probably familiar with the current slime obsession. My daughter and her friends became obsessed with it a few months ago and couldn\u2019t get enough of it. So much so that they decided they would start making it themselves at home, a simple endeavor providing you have the right ingredients. When my 12 year old got sick, we thought it was the same basic cold. Symptoms were the same: cough, sore throat, stuffy nose. She was also complaining about headaches and general achiness. Weeks later, we were still left wondering what on earth was going on. To the doctor we went. We had her take a throat culture, check her lungs, and ears and sinuses. She found nothing. Other than your basic cold symptoms, there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with her on the surface. My husband was actually the one who connected the dots. He told me one night, \u201cDo you think it could have something to do with the slime she\u2019s been making?\u201d From that moment, we banned her from making, holding, touching or even looking at that darn slime. The very next day, her headache went away. Her throat didn\u2019t hurt anymore. She still had some congestion, but wasn\u2019t coughing. Two days later, the congestion started going away. She was breathing better and talking better. No more achiness.\n\nWhile we cannot speak to the specific mechanism behind the daughter\u2019s ailment, it is not impossible that one or more ingredients of slime may contributed in some way. Everyone reacts differently to certain compounds, and sensitivity to one of the compounds present in slime is a possibility. Furthermore, if the daughter was frequently in contact with dry borax, it is possible that compound could have contributed to respiratory problems (just like any other fine particulate powder) or skin irritation.\n\nAdditionally, as a solution of borax necessarily produces boric acid, improper dilution can also lead to skin irritation and even, as has been reported, serious burns.\n\nUnfortunately, the post went on to list myriad other possible health risks of slime, borrowing heavily from information presented by the British tabloid Daily Mail and other questionable sources, many of which are either completely false, or generally misleading. These claims include:\n\u2022 Borax is toxic to all cells and is linked to kidney toxicity, cerebral edema, and gastroenteritis, and (according to the Daily Mail) can lead to infertility.\n\u2022 The glue used in slime causes the same symptoms one would experience from huffing or sniffing glue fumes, including anxiety, convulsions, respiratory failure, seizures, and coma.\n\u2022 Ingredients in shaving cream can cause cancer and create health problems for women by mimicking estrogen.\n\nThere is a kernel of truth the claims made about Borax (aka sodium borate). It is indeed toxic if ingested, but an ordinarily healthy person would need to ingest a relatively large amount of it to suffer serious health effects. Some governmental bodies, including the government of Canada, have recommended against Borax\u2019s use in children\u2019s craft projects, citing concerns about the cumulative effects of long-term exposure from both natural and unnatural sources.\n\nThis move likely reflects an abundance of caution. A comprehensive review of the toxicity of borate-based products in humans concluded that the doses required to create any genotoxic or acute toxic effects are absurdly unrealistic:\n\nInorganic borates, including boric acid, Na, ammonium, K, and Zn borates generally display low acute toxicity orally, dermally, and by inhalation. They are either not irritant or mild skin and eye irritants. The critical effects in several species [of borates] are male reproductive toxicity and developmental toxicity. The doses that cause these effects are far higher than any levels to which the human population could be exposed. Humans would need to consume daily some 3.3 g of boric acid (or 5.0 g borax) to ingest the same dose level as the lowest animal [no-observed-adverse-effect-level, NOAEL]. No effects on fertility were seen in a population of workers exposed to borates or to a population exposed to high environmental borate levels. There is remarkable similarity in the toxicological effects of boric acid and borax across different species.\n\nA separate detailed review of studies on both humans and laboratory animals, concerned specifically with human developmental and reproductive toxicity, similarly concluded that \u201cThe typical human exposures are below the minimum level considered to be adverse to reproduction.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the above-cited work all assumes actual consumption of borax, as it does not easily pass through unbroken skin. Considering that a) the goal is not to eat the slime, and b) the recipe calls for about 1g diluted in 20 ml of water, the use of borax in slime does not represent a realistic toxic, genotoxic, or reproductive health risk.\n\nIn the \u201cThis Talk Ain\u2019t Cheap\u201d post, the author linked to fact sheet about household glue poisoning from MedlinePlus (a program of the National Institutes of Health). That post explicitly stated that \u201cmost household glues, such as Elmer\u2019s Glue-All, are not poisonous.\u201d\n\nAll of the symptoms listed in the Facebook post, sourced from this fact sheet, concern glue that contains volatile organic compounds (Ethanol, Xylene, Light aliphatic naphtha, N-hexane, Toluene) that Elmer\u2019s glue (or other \u201cwhite glue\u201d) does not contain.\n\nTo support claims that shaving cream is dangerous, the author cites a \u201cHowStuffWorks\u201d post titled \u201cAre There Harmful Chemicals in Shaving Cream?\u201d That article highlights a number of chemicals it states can cause harm, but it does so inaccurately and with misleading information:\n\u2022 Triethanolamine, better known as TEA (which may or may not contain nitrosamines)\n\nThese ingredients (though not nitrosamines) are all listed as present in the commonly used Barbasol brand of shaving cream, but the statement of their risks as it relates to homemade slime is not accurate or largely misleading.\n\nThe HowStuffWorks post states that \u201cPropolene [sic] glycol is a humectant like glycerin, but unlike glycerin, it\u2019s more frequently found in antifreeze and brake fluid.\u201d While using the term \u201cantifreeze\u201d is a popular scare tactic for those inclined to chemophobia, Propylene glycol is not toxic to humans in any relevant dose. While Propylene glycol is a mild skin irritant to some people, it is recognized as safe for both food and cosmetic use.\n\nWith regard to Triethanolamine (TEA), that post stated \u201cIt\u2019s also a very controversial ingredient in the cosmetic industry because not only is it a skin irritant, but many formulas containing TEA are found to be contaminated with nitrosamines, which are linked to cancer.\u201d\n\nWhile TEA may also be a skin irritant to some (though clearly not enough to produce a massive epidemic of unshaved men), the jump to nitrosamines \u2014 which are unequivocally carcinogenic \u2014 is, again, misleading.\n\nNitrosamines are not added to cosmetics but are instead formed when amines (a chemical commonly found in proteins) mix with a nitrosating chemical (a chemical that, generally speaking, adds a nitrate group to its chemical structure). Because nitrosamines form through natural physical processes, they occur in nature and in low quantities ubiquitously. In an effort to prevent their formation in cosmetics, governmental regulators such as the FDA and the European Union Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety have placed strict requirements to mitigate their formation and have enacted associated testing and monitoring requirements. Is it possible that there are nitrosamines in shaving cream? Yes. But if nitrosamines even in small quantities were dangerous, then one would also have to avoid, according to a 1990 review, \u201cBacon, ham, frankfurters, sausage, cured meat products, poultry, fish, and fish products, cheese, beer, malt, grain, margarine, edible vegetable oils, water, air, and soil.\u201d\n\nBoth SLS and SLES can, like any detergent compound that removes oil from your skin, cause irritation. The claim that SLS interacts with estrogen in humans is not found in any of the 3,155 scientific articles listed on the PubChem website for the chemical, nor in any of the 306 articles in the National Institute of Health\u2019s curated list of research related to SLS\u2019s adverse effects.\n\nThe argument regarding dioxane is similar to the nitrosamine argument above, as the compound can introduced as an impurity during synthesis of the above sulfate compounds. Its presence in many cosmetics, as well as its carcinogenicity, are not in question. However, at concentrations found even in the most egregiously contaminated shaving creams (further diluted by other slime ingredients), it would not pose a credible health risk.\n\nWhile we cannot rank the specific personal circumstances described in the \u201cThis Talk Ain\u2019t Cheap\u201d post, we can say that claims of other more terrifying slime-related health concerns are not rooted in reality, so long as one is not actively eating the final product or breathing copious amounts of dry borax during its production.", "lang": "en"}
