That is clear from recent incidents that are part of an uptick in \u201cnear-confrontation\u201d military encounters between the countries.\n\nThe latest incident took place on Aug. 28 in the Bering Sea. Alaskan fishermen reported that a group of U.S. fishing trawlers was operating in neutral waters 80 miles from the U.S.-Russia maritime boundary when Russian voices started coming out of their ships\u2019 radios.\n\nThe voices switched to English and ordered the fishermen \u201cto move away at maximum speed.\u201d Immediately after the warning, the American fishermen saw that \u201c[t]hree warships and two support vessels of theirs were coming and would not turn,\u201d according to Alaska Public Media. The Russian war vessels \u201ccame marching right through\u201d the fishing fleet, a witness said.\n\nA video filmed from one of the American fishing boats and posted on YouTube confirms the account. Other boats were \u201cbuzzed\u201d by Russian aircraft, which flew low over the fishing fleet and ordered the Americans to leave the area in a specific direction.\n\nThe U.S. said initially that it knew about the Russian naval drills in the Bering Sea and had been observing them, but later added that officials would investigate \u201cunprofessional interactions\u201d by the Russian military.\n\nRussia said more than 50 warships, including two nuclear submarines, and 40 aircraft, including nuclear-capable bombers, took part in the Bering Sea war games dubbed \u201cOcean Shield.\u201d\n\nThe drills included launching P-1000 Vulkan missiles from a cruiser and P-100 anti-ship cruise missiles from a submarine.\n\nThe Russian defense ministry released a video of its \u201cOmsk\u201d nuclear-powered cruise missile submarine surfacing \u201cnear the coast of Alaska.\u201d One of the country\u2019s top admirals said the exercise was \u201ca signal to NATO.\u201d\n\nAccording to news reports, during the exercises, the U.S. military eventually moved from \u201cobserving\u201d to \u201cintercepting\u201d after six Russian Tu-142 maritime patrol aircraft and Su-35 fighter jets \u201centered the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone\u201d overnight on Aug. 27-28.\n\nThis was the fifth such incident off the coast of Alaska this year involving Russian military aircraft, U.S. officials said.\n\nOn Aug. 27, the Russian defense ministry said in a statement that military police \u201cundertook necessary measures to prevent an incident\u201d in eastern Syria when a U.S. military convoy \u201cattempted to block\u201d a Russian patrol in \u201cviolation of existing agreements.\u201d\n\nA few hours earlier, the Pentagon had said several U.S. troops were injured as a result of \u201cdeliberately provocative and aggressive behavior\" by Russian forces during a collision between the American and the Russian convoys in eastern Syria.\n\nBoth statements referred to an incident that took place in Syria\u2019s eastern Hasakah province on Aug. 26. Video of the incident showed up on Rusvesna.su, a Russian website known for publishing videos recorded by the Russian troops and veterans, under the headline: \u201cHow the Russian Army pursued U.S. troops in Syria.\u201d The U.S. publication Military Times also published a video of the incident.\n\nIn the video, Russians can be heard clearly communicating with other vehicles and aircraft, coordinating their moves. The phrases in Russian include \u201cfaster, faster,\u201d \u201cdon\u2019t let them escape,\u201d \u201ccut them off,\u201d \u201cblock them,\u201d along with some derogatory language.\n\nIn a similar incident in Syria, which was also filmed and posted by Rusvesna.su on July 17, a Russian officer scolds his American counterpart through a Russian serviceman who was translating, saying: \u201cLet him tell his general that the Russians have earnestly asked not to pursue them again.\u201d\n\nIn February 2018, hundreds of Russian mercenary troops reportedly were killed after U.S. forces came under artillery attack from pro-Syrian government forces. Russian officials disputed that a large number of Russian mercenaries died.\n\nOn Aug. 18, the head of the Russian oil giant Rosneft, Igor Sechin, visited President Vladimir Putin in his Novo-Ogaryovo residence outside Moscow. Sechin brought Putin a gift: a fancy, framed bottle of Arctic oil. The Russian energy industry under Putin is boosting its presence in the Arctic, with multibillion-dollar investments in oil and natural gas, new transportation hubs and protected sea corridors.\n\nAlaska and the Arctic region are increasingly becoming a site of a great-power strategic competition, and some analysts say the U.S. needs to change its thinking about Alaska. In mid-August, the Trump administration said it would start offering leases for oil and gas development in Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge by year\u2019s end.\n\nOn Tuesday, Aug. 8, Norway announced that its navy will participate in NATO military drills in the Barents Sea \u2013 entering, for the \u201cfirst time in recent history,\u201d the \u201cRussian exclusive economic zone.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. said the drill will be led by the British Navy and is aimed at improving security to protect the freedom of navigation \u201cin the challenging environment above the Arctic Circle.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the Russian government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta cited the Russian armed forces\u2019 National Center of Defense Administration as saying that it is monitoring the movements of NATO vessels in the Barents Sea. If there is a confrontation, \u201cAmerican missiles and strategic aviation will hit Russia via the North Pole,\u201d but Russia is ready for that and \u201cthe region is under our control,\u201d the report said.", "lang": "en"}
