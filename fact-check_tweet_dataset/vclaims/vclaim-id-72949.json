Scott Walker\u2019s 2015-\u201917 budget proposal, a number of ideas have popped up about how to generate revenue for Wisconsin state parks.\n\nDuring a March 3, 2015, meeting of the Legislature\u2019s Joint Finance Committee, state Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, suggested to Natural Resources Secretary Cathy Stepp that there was a way to capitalize on all the visitors from Illinois.\n\nWisconsin already charges higher state parks admission fees for visitors from other states. Annual stickers cost $25 for Badgers and $35 for others; a night camping at Devil\u2019s Lake, our most-visited park, is $15 for Wisconsin residents and $17 for outsiders.\n\nMarklein said fees could be raised, and the flatlanders -- er, Illinois residents -- would keep on coming to Wisconsin.\n\n\"They love coming up,\" Marklein said. \"They can drink beer in our parks. They can't there.\"\n\nWisconsinites have a long-standing love-hate relationship with visitors from Illinois. For many in the hospitality business, Illinois visitors are a vital source of revenue. Others fret that they overwhelm Wisconsin with big city driving habits and attitudes.\n\nBut aside from the all that, we wondered if Marklein is right. You can pop a brewski at Devil\u2019s Lake State Park, or other parks in Wisconsin, but you can\u2019t do that in the Land of Lincoln?\n\nWhen we followed up with Marklein, aide Crystal Potts said the senator was basing his comments on a list posted in the Illinois Department of Natural Resources website.\n\nThe list, under the tab \"alcohol restrictions,\" lists 53 state parks and recreation areas -- from Apple River Canyon State Park to Wolf Creek State Park. The page says violators face a misdemeanor that carries a fine of $75 to up to $1,500 and one to six months in jail.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty steep for a Bud Light by the campfire.\n\nIn Wisconsin, other than a handful of exceptions, drinking is allowed in state parks.\n\nBut there are a couple problems with Marklein\u2019s list.\n\nFirst, for many of the parks the list notes restrictions only at certain areas within a park, not the entire park. What\u2019s more, there are many state parks in Illinois that are not on the list at all.\n\nThe Illinois DNR confirmed that there is not a universal alcohol ban in that state.\n\n\"Out of the 130 parks, there are 77 (where) alcohol is allowed,\" said an email from the Illinois DNR. \"It is only banned in the parks that are listed.\"\n\nSo we\u2019ve got plenty of reasons for visitors to escape to Wisconsin and -- with budget troubles -- perhaps even a new reason to charge them more.\n\nBut the pleasure of a cold beer on a hot summer night isn\u2019t among them.\n\nMarklein wants to boost state parks\u2019 charges for out of state residents, and -- noting how many people from Illinois come to Wisconsin -- he claimed visitors can\u2019t drink in state parks in Illinois.\n\nBut you can drink in more than half of the parks in that state.", "lang": "en"}
