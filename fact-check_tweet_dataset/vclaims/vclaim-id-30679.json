She was a happy and caring 28 year old who many confused as teenager due to her spunk, laughter and her childlike antics. She was always doing what she could to make you laugh, but one evening on 8/29/2019, our lives would change forever. She was on her way to the arcade to meet up with friends with her boyfriend, and as they were crossing an intersection in the city of Downey, California, a distracted driver, ran a red light and struck Ariana and her boyfriend, Jason. Upon arrival to the hospital, Jason died 2 hours later from severe head trauma and on 8/30/2019, Ariana was also declared brain dead due to severe head trauma as well. Being that she was a kind and giving soul, donating her organs was something she would have wanted and because of that, she is helping 6 recipients to have a better life. Our Ariana is now in Paradise but her compassion and love will forever remain in our hearts and in those recipients\u2019 lives.\n\nThis description corresponds with various reports of a pedestrian accident that claimed the life of a person of the same name and age on that date.\n\nAn \u201chonor walk\u201d is the name given to a ritual undertaken \u201cto show respect to patients at the end of life who are donating organs to others.\u201d\n\nHospitals across the United States are holding honor walks as dignified ways to honor each patient\u2019s final contribution. \n\n The honor walk takes place at an odd pause between life and death: Either brain death has been declared already in a donor whose heart still beats, or the donor\u2019s heart will soon stop beating. An honor walk is a powerful act of community. Something solemn, even sacred, happens in those 15 minutes in the hallway. We wait and talk with people from all professions and all walks of life. Together, we honor a great sacrifice. We give thanks. We hope to help a grieving family in a moment of fathomless loss.", "lang": "en"}
