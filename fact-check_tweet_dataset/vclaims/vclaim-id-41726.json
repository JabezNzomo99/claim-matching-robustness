Another variation attributed the advice to a Dr Alexis Reyes of the Makati Medical Center (MMC).\n\n\"He has filmed a video of a Mexican family in the United States that affirmed that they were cured with a home remedy: Three 500 gr aspirins dissolved in lemon juice boiled with honey, it is taken hot and the next day, as if nothing had happened to them!\" the text said. The \"he\" referred to in the text was unclear.\n\nThe facts: There are no specific vaccines, medicines, or treatments for COVID-19, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Reyes and the MMC denied releasing the message.\n\nReyes, who is a consultant of the hospital, also told Rappler that she did not post this message. Rappler also reached out to the UST Faculty of Medicine and Surgery to ask if they shared this message but has not received a response as of writing.\n\n\"While some home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19,\" WHO Philippines said in response to the claim.\n\nA scientific brief from WHO said: \"At present there is no evidence of severe adverse events, acute health care utilization, long-term survival, or quality of life in patients with COVID-19, as a result of the use of NSAIDs [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs].\" NSAIDs include aspirin.\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
