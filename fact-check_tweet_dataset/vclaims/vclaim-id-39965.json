Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nWhen the video in the post was run through the \u2018InVid\u2019 plugin, several keyframes were obtained. On subjecting these keyframes to reverse image search, no relevant search results were obtained. In the video, a store \u201cPirson chemists & druggists\u201d can be seen at -0:54 duration.\n\nWhen looked on Google Maps with the keywords Pirson chemists & druggists\u2019, a store with that name was found to exist in Jammu & Kashmir. So, it can be concluded that the video was taken in Jammu & Kashmir.\n\nAlso, a watermark \u201cAP\u201d can be seen on the posted video. On searching in \u201cAP Archive\u201d YouTube channel with keywords \u2018Muharram Kashmir\u2019, many search results were obtained. When one goes through those search results, the video posted was found among them. From the description of the video, it was found that the video shows security forces in Kashmir dispersing Muslims who took part in \u2018Muharram\u2019 procession. But, when one looks at timestamp of the video, it was known to be uploaded on 31 July 2015. So, it is an old video and has nothing to do with the current events.\n\nTo conclude, an old video of security forces dispersing a \u2018Muharram\u2019 procession in Kashmir is being falsely shared as a recent one.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Indian Rivers?", "lang": "en"}
