The Sultan's wife, accompanied by the Sultan and religious speaker Morari Baapu, carried a copy of the holy Ramayana to the temple. A sight to behold.\"\n\nYou can view the video here and access its archived version here.\n\nThe video is viral on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nThe claim with the viral video itself is an immediate giveaway to its falsity.\n\nWhile the video claims that the Sultan's wife is carrying a copy of Ramayana to the first Hindu temple, it is important to state that the first Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi is yet to be constructed.\n\nThe foundation stone of the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Temple or the BAPS Hindu temple was laid on April 20, 2019 and its construction is still underway.\n\nMoreover, the foundation stone of the temple was laid by Swami Mahraj, the spiritual leader of the BAPS Swaminaryana Sansthan, and not Morari Bapu.\n\nBelow is the video from the foundation laying ceremony of the Hindu temple on April 20.\n\nWhere Is The Viral Video From?\n\nIn 2018 BOOM wrote a fact-check where several mainstream Indian news outlets wrongly attributed an Emirati columnist saying \u2018Jai Siya Ram\u2019 in a two-year old video, to the crown prince of Abu Dhabi. Read about it here - Indian Mainstream News Peddles Video Claiming Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Said \u2018Jai Siya Ram\u2019\n\nThe man in that video was Sultan Sooud Al Qassemi - a UAE-based columnist and a prominent commentator on Arab affairs.\n\nSultan Sooud Al Qassemi can also be seen in the viral video along with Morari Bapu.\n\nWe then searched for the original video on Morari Bapu's YouTube page with keywords 'Ramkatha Abu Dhabi 2016' and found that the full version of the video. This makes it clear that the video is around three years old and not from the Hindu temple foundation laying ceremony.\n\nWho is the woman carrying the Ramayana?\n\nIn February 2018. ABP News - in its fact-checking show Viral Sach - found out that the woman shown carrying the Ramayana on her head was the daughter of the organiser of the Ram Katha event.", "lang": "en"}
