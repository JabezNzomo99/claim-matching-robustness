We will construct it. A big one. We will tell (you) when will it be built. And we will construct it, after all we razed it (Babri).\"\n\nWhen the reporter asks her whether she was involved in the demolition of Babri Masjid and whether she was proud of it, she says, \"Of course, I went. I stood atop the structure and brought it down, and I am proud of it.\"\n\nThe video can be viewed here and its archived version can be accessed here.\n\nThe post, now viral on Facebook, has been shared prominently from a page Master Stroke.\n\nEven verified Twitter handles seem to have fallen for the claim and tweeted it.\n\nSadhvi Pragya Thakur is an accused in the 2008 Malegaon (Maharashtra) bomb blast. She was arrested in 2008 and granted bail by the Bombay High Court in 2017. Thakur is now contesting Lok Sabha elections from Bhopal on a Bharatiya Janta Party ticket\n\nBOOM looked up Pragya Thakur's affidavit for the Lok Sabha elections 2019 where her age is stated as 49 years. This means, at the time of Babri Mosque demolition i.e. 1992, Sadhvi Pragya Thakur would have been around 22 years old.\n\nClick here to view her affidavit.\n\nBOOM also found out Thakur's bail appeal filed in the Bombay High Court in 2016, which mentioned her age as 44 years which would make her 20 years old in 1992.\n\nIf Thakur was 44 years old in 2016, over the next three years she should have been 47. However, the affidavit filed by Thakur ahead of elections in April 2019 mentions her age as 49.\n\nEither way, the claim of her being 4 years old in 1992, does not hold.", "lang": "en"}
