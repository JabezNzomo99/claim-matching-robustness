No, that is not true. Not even close, according to government records.. She was in California six days after the House impeachment -- and in Kansas City in plain view, six days after the Senate voted February 5, 2020, to acquit Trump. So, no matter which date is used, she was nowhere near Wuhan -- the believed site of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe post making the claim (archived here) came from Randall Thompson on Facebook on April 22, 2020. It says:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nAssuming the poster meant Trump's acquittal in the impeachment process, we'll start there.\n\nAs to her whereabouts on Feb. 11, Pelosi was posing with Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri in Kansas City, appearing before news cameras. As to what she was doing, the two had just made a friendly wager on Super Bowl LIV between the San Francisco 49ers -- Pelosi's hometown team -- and the Kansas City Chiefs. Cleaver is the former mayor of Kansas City. They were talking football. Standing in public, in view of the media. She said:\n\nThe speaker's schedule and whereabouts are a matter of public record.\n\nPrevious guesses about Pelosi's whereabouts have similarly failed. For example, Lead Stories debunked an April 23 accusation suggesting she was in Wuhan, China, ahead of the COVID-19 outbreak and sabotaged a trade deal.\n\nBut what if by \"six days\" Thompson meant that Pelosi went to China six days after the House did impeach Trump, before sending articles of impeachment to the Senate?\n\nAs stated in the U.S. Constitution, the House votes on articles of impeachment. Trump was found guilty of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress on Dec. 18, 2019. The vote was 230-197 to impeach, and will stay on the record despite the later acquittal, according to History.com.\n\nSo where was Pelosi on Dec. 24? At home, in California, getting ready for Christmas Eve with her family, and sending out this message:", "lang": "en"}
