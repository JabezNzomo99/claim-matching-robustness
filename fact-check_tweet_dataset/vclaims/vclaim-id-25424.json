The tweet has been posted on July 27 and has been retweeted over 370 times so far. The video has concomitantly gone viral on Facebook, where several individual users have posted it on their timelines with the same narrative. The video posted on Facebook is of 2:31 minutes.\n\nIn the epic Ramayana, Jatayu witnesses Sita being kidnapped by Ravana and tries to stop him before Ravana chops off one of its wings. According to legend, the mythical bird fell at Chadayamangalam in the Kollam district of Kerala. The viral message now claims that the Jatayu has been spotted there. The message has also been circulated in Marathi.\n\nThe bird seen in the video is a condor. The condor is a common name for two species of vultures- the Andean Condor which is found mainly in the Andes mountain range of South America, and the California Condor which inhabits California and parts of Arizona and Utah in the USA. These are two of the largest flying birds, with wingspan of upto 3.2 metres for Andean Condors.\n\nThe video circulated on social media platforms is not recent. Alt News reverse-searched one of the frames of the video and found that it was uploaded on YouTube in April 2014. The video is posted below.\n\nThe name of this condor is Sayani. Sayani was found poisoned at Catamarca, Argentina before she was rescued and successfully released into the wild. The Dodoreports,\n\n\u201cWith the help of local police and officials, Sayani was sent to the Buenos Aires Zoo for treatment for over a year. And finally, 16 months after being found, the bird became strong enough to be wild again. On March 28, 2014, Sayani\u2019s rescuers gathered on the top of a mountain in Catamarca with Sayani, ready to set him free.\u201d\n\nA giant sculpture of Jatayu has been installed atop a hill in Chadayamangalam in Kerala, the place where the mythical bird is supposed to have fallen. It may be reiterated that the claim accompanying the viral video asserts that the bird was spotted there.\n\nIn conclusion, it may be stated that the viral video does not depict the mythical bird Jatayu. It is a video of a condor which was rescued and then released into the wild in 2014. Recently, a giant sculpture by an Italian artist was passed off as the skeleton of Ghatotkach, the son of Bheem in the Mahabharata.", "lang": "en"}
