Claire McCaskill, D-Missou", "author": "www.politifact.com", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-76745", "url": "http://www.politifact.com/missouri/statements/2017/apr/24/claire-mccaskill/mccaskill-doesnt-account-all-refugee-cases/", "vclaim": "McCaskill addressed the extreme vetting process refugees entering the United States had to undergo even before the ban introduced by Donald Trump on Jan. 27, which temporarily blocked refugees from seven majority-Muslim countries. To reach the United States, she said, refugees must first go through international powers.\n\nWhile there are millions of refugees worldwide, only a sliver of them qualify for refugee resettlement, said Nayla Rush, a senior researcher at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors lowering immigration. And resettlement is only sought by the world\u2019s most vulnerable refugees \u2014 those who have fled their home countries for a second country and either cannot return home or must then flee to a third. These \"third\" countries, according to the U.S. Department of State, are \"typically more developed countries, further from conflict regions, such as the United States.\" Resettlement does not apply to every person seeking refugee status.\n\nYungk directed us to a State Department report to Congress on proposed refugee admissions for fiscal year 2017. The document explained that refugees looking to apply for resettlement are categorized into three different \"priority\" groups. The way an individual reaches the United States \u2013 through the United Nations or not \u2013 depends on the priority group he or she is in.\n\n-- In Priority 1 cases, individuals are referred to the United States Refugee Admissions Program by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees based on their circumstances and need for resettlement. This means that the people in this category apply and are admitted to the program individually, on a case by case basis.\n\n--In Priority 2 cases, groups of people are referred to the Refugee Admissions Program based on their circumstances and need for resettlement. This means that those in this category apply and are admitted to the program in groups, and not on a case-by-case basis. -- In Priority 3 cases, refugees are referred to the Refugee Admissions Program through applications submitted by nuclear family members already living in the United States. These refugees are \"granted access for the purposes of reunification\" with their families, according to the report to Congress.\n\nResettlement cases in each priority group can be processed either through the U.N. or the United States depending on the circumstance, Yungk said, though the majority of cases are handled through the U.N. In Priority 3 cases, the United States is most involved. In Priority 1 cases, the U.N. is most involved.\n\n\"We don\u2019t refer anybody under P3 because that\u2019s a U.S. program,\" Yungk said. \"In P2, I would say about half the group are ours and about half are U.S.-defined P2s ... most of the individual cases come from us,\" he said.\n\nOverall, most refugees seeking resettlement to the United States must first go through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. However, refugees with nuclear family members already living in the United States are given a different priority that isn\u2019t processed through the United Nations.", "lang": "en"}
