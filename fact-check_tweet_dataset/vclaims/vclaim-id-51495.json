Through this article let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Soldiers of Indian army doing their duty sitting on a branch of a tree in Kashmir valley.

Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nBy cropping the image in the post and subjecting the image of only the tree to Yandex reverse image search we found the original image. In the original image, we can see no soldiers. Also, by cropping the image in the post and subjecting the image of only the soldiers to reverse image search we found a similar image of soldiers sitting on the ground. Both these separate images are edited and put together as a single image and is being shared falsely.\n\nTo sum it up, separate image of two soldiers and a tree are photoshopped so as to look like the soldiers are sitting on a tree. The image in the post is doctored one.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
