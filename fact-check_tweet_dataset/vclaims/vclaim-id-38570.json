BOOM has chosen not to include the footage, as it is disturbing in nature.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of Ahmed's tweet.\n\nClick here to view the tweet and here for its archive.\n\nThe same video was tweeted by another verified handle, Faleh Al-Shibly, an author, with claims that Hindus buried the Muslim woman and her son, after killing them. Below is the screenshot of the tweet. Click here to view the archive of the tweet.\n\nMultiple other handles, including one Pakistani major of the armed forces tweeted the same footage with a similar narrative.\n\nThe video is viral with similar claims on Facebook.\n\nBOOM was able to ascertain that the video is from the Eastern part of India, as men can be heard speaking in Bengali. Men can heard exclaiming 'aha re,' a colloquial term to express grief or sorrow. Later in the video another man can be heard expressing anguish when the infant's body is dug out. He refers to the child as 'dadu', a way of referring to grandchildren in Bengal. At 1 minute 32 second mark, a man instructs another to keep the corpses as it is, in Bengali.\n\nUpon relevant keyword searches in Bengali, we found footage from the same incident, shot from different angles, uploaded to YouTube, by a user named Er Aftarul Haque. The user had uploaded three different videos from the incident.\n\nOne of the videos was described as an incident from Islampur, North Bengal. The description, when translated to English, reads, \"Mother and child found after digging, Islampur.\" (Original text in Bengali: \u09ae\u09be\u099f\u09bf \u0996\u09c1\u09a1\u09bc\u09c7 \u09aa\u09be\u0993\u09af\u09bc\u09be \u0997\u09c7\u09b2\u09cb \u09b6\u09bf\u09b6\u09c1 \u0993 \u09a4\u09be\u09b0 \u09ae\u09be || \u0987\u09b8\u09b2\u09be\u09ae\u09aa\u09c1\u09b0)\n\nAnother 22 second long footage of unearthing the dead bodies was described as a crime committed by the husband. \"Mother and child buried by husband in Islampur,\" read the description.\n\nUpon relevant keyword searches, we found the same video that featured as part of a news bulletin of Mahanagar 24X7 Bengali which reported about the incident on January 30.\n\nBOOM also did a comparison between the viral footage, and the video that was played in the news report.\n\nAccording to reports, the incident occurred in North Dinajpur district's Islampur area (Shujali), and was a case of domestic violence. A man, identified as Akbar Alam, murdered his wife, Noor Jahan and two month old daughter Rizwana, and buried them in the backyard of their house. Angry villagers set Alam's house on fire after the incident. Alam who married the deceased two years ago, was not happy with the birth of a girl child. He killed both the mother and the daughter, on January 29 and buried them. He later fled the area. \n\n\n\nThe incident was also reported in News 18 Bangla and Ei Samay.\n\nBelow is a screenshot from the incident, that was used in Ei Samay.", "lang": "en"}
