(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Facebook page that posted the photo did not immediately respond to a message asking for evidence for its claim.\n\nAn image search shows the photo is doctored.\n\nThe photo was taken of the couple years ago while Hawn and Russell were out in Los Angeles, according to a September 2015 PopSugar article. They can be seen walking together, holding hands and wearing the same outfits the altered photo shows them in \u2014 only without American flags or references to Trump or ISIS on their white shirts.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Russell has been tied to Trump in viral social media posts. An image recently circulated on Facebook with a quote from Russell praising Trump. We rated that Pants on Fire.\n\nAn altered photo attempts to depict Russell and Hawn as Trump supporters, by adding \"Trump 2016,\" American flags and more to their shirts. An image search quickly shows those aren\u2019t the original outfits the couple was wearing.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
