Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Video of Imran Khan\u2019s first interview after the revocation of Article 370 in Kashmir. Fact: The video is a 4-year old one showing Imran Khan losing his temper at a press conference. It has nothing to do with the revocation of Article 370 in Kashmir on 5th August this year. So, the claim made in the post stands FALSE.\n\nWhen the video in the post is run through the \u2018InVid\u2019 plugin, several keyframes were obtained. On subjecting these keyframes to reverse image search technique, a certain keyframe lead to the same video on YouTube. Based on the timestamp of the video, it was found to be uploaded December 19, 2015.\n\nWhen searched with keywords on YouTube, the same video was found with the title \u201cImran Khan gets angry during press conference In Islamabad 8th June 2015 On Geo News\u201d. In the video, Imran Khan can be heard speaking something about \u2018Punjab Police\u2019, when searched further, a newspaper article of \u201cSamaa Tv\u201d published on June 8, 2015, that reported about Imran Khan blaming Punjab Police for murders that took place at Rawalpindi was found and it can be read here. \n\n\n\n\u2018Factly\u2019 couldn\u2019t confirm if the video posted and the above newspaper article are linked to the same incident. But it could be concluded that the video is an old video and it has no relation with the revocation of Article 370 in Kashmir on August 5, 2019.\n\nTo summarize, a 4-year old video of Imran Khan losing his temper is falsely shared as Imran Khan\u2019s first interview after the revocation of Article 370.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
