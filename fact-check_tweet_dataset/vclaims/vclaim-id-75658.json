While governments and international investors are focused on the overall Doing Business ranking, the 'Distance to Frontier' is a more relevant indicator of conditions faced by domestic small and medium enterprises (SMEs).\n\nEase of doing business ranking can show only how much a country's regulatory environment has changed relative to that in other economies.\n\nWhile distance to frontier score shows how much the regulatory environment for local entrepreneurs in an economy has changed over time in absolute terms.\n\nIndia's DB 2018 ranking is based on data collected from two major business cities in India - Mumbai and Delhi. DB 2018 is based on data from June 2, 2016 to June 1, 2017.\n\nIndira Chand, Senior Communications Officer at the World Bank's Global Indicators Group, says a country's rankings are not comparable over time\n\nThe rankings are relative, subject to performance of other countries\n\nDTF scores show how an economy has improved over the years in absolute terms. DTF was introduced only in Doing Business 2015.\n\n'Doing Business' underwent methodological revisions \u2013 introduction and expansion of measures over the years. To account for the expansion of methodology World Bank recalculated DTF scores of previous years. Thus, DTF scores of only DB 2016 \u2013 2018 can be compared.\n\nThe distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the \u201cfrontier,\u201d which represents the best performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. The score is out of 100 with 0 representing the lowest performance and 100 the frontier.\n\nBased on its DTF score how has India fared in DB 2018?\n\nIndia\u2019s DTF score in DB 2018 is 60.76 which means India is around 40 percentage points away from the frontier. This year New Zealand ranked 1st with a DTF score of 86.55, followed by Singapore with score of 84.57.\n\nIndia\u2019s DTF score improved by 4.71 percentage points in DB 2018 from 56.05 in DB 2017.\n\nIndia was listed by the World Bank as one of the top 'improvers' this year with having implementing reforms in 8 out of 10 areas in a single year.\n\nIndia\u2019s performance over past 15 years is also commendable for implementing 37 reforms, the highest in South Asia. Sri Lanka follows with 22 reforms and Pakistan with 19.\n\nHow did India perform in each of the parameters?\n\nWe see that India\u2019s performance has improved the most in \u2018Paying Taxes\u2019 followed by \u2018Getting Credit\u2019.\n\nHowever, certain indicators have not shown much progress since two years.\n\nDB 2018 data is not representative of the whole country\n\nIndia's DB 2018 ranking is only based on Mumbai and Delhi.\n\nDoing Business collects data only from the largest business city of an economy. However, for countries with a population above 100 million, data from the second biggest city is also included. Thus, DB 2018 data for India is from Mumbai and Delhi.\n\nDoing Business collects sub-national (other cities) data for countries. India\u2019s latest available data on sub national level (17 cities) is of 2009.\n\nIs DB data a reflection of ground reality or only announcement of reforms?\n\nBOOM asked the World Bank if the 8 reforms undertaken by India reflect reality on the ground.\n\nFollowing are the reforms undertaken in 8 areas -\n\nBased on World Bank's response, the reforms in the 8 areas can be classified as follows for their impact.\n\nHow does the World Bank measure ease of doing business in a country?\n\nThe data are sourced from laws and regulations of countries, expert respondents, governments and World Bank regional staff.\n\nData are collected through questionnaires, conference calls, written correspondence and visits by the World Bank team.\n\nAlmost, two third of the data for DB indicators are sourced by reading of relevant law and regulations forms. The report incorporates responses from around 13,000 professionals across 190 countries.", "lang": "en"}
