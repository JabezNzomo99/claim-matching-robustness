The Express exercise doesn't give us a good fix on what the wider public think.\n\nWe've pointed out before that polls are only useful if those replying are representative of wider opinion\u2014no matter how many people are asked. The British Polling Council say that surveys where the participants are self-selecting are problematic.\n\nThe Express front page does make clear how the ballot was conducted, but both the print and online headlines overstate its importance.", "lang": "en"}
