This map is a prank created by Barstool Sports.\n\nThe first hint is that this data was supposedly compiled by an organization called the Public Information and Statistics Society. Not only could we not find an official organization by this name, the acronym for this group is PISS, which, to say the least, is a bit suspicious.\n\nBarstool Sports\u2019 punny follow-up tweet also points to the humorous intentions of this map:\n\nThis map of favorite restaurants also doesn\u2019t add up, geographically speaking. For instance, the map claims that The Rainforest Cafe is Colorado\u2019s favorite restaurant chain, despite the fact that there are no Rainforest Cafe locations in the state.\n\nIn short, this viral map supposedly showing the most popular restaurant chains by state isn\u2019t real and was a joke shared by Barstool Sports that isn\u2019t based on any data from a reputable source. In other words, the Barstool Sports and the Public Information for Statistics Society are just \u201ctaking the piss.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
