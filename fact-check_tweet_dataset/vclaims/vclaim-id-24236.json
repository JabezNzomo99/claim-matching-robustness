It is titled \u2013 \u201c\u092a\u0902\u091c\u093e\u092c\u0940 \u0935\u094b\u091f\u0930 \u0905\u0917\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0930\u093e \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u0926\u0947\u0902 \u0924\u094b \u0926\u0947\u0939\u093e\u0924\u0940 \u091c\u093e\u091f \u0917\u0941\u091c\u094d\u091c\u0930\u094b\u0902 \u0914\u0930 \u092c\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u0927\u0942\u0932 \u091a\u091f\u093e \u0926\u0942\u0902\u0917\u093e \u2013 \u0930\u093e\u0918\u0935 \u091a\u0921\u094d\u0922\u093e| (If Punjabi voters support me, I will defeat Jats, Gujjars and Biharis \u2013 Raghav Chadha)\u201d\n\nThe quote attributed to the AAP candidate for South-East Delhi is also circulating on Twitter.\n\nRaghav Chadha rubbished the claims on his official Facebook page, terming the news fake and a work of photoshop.\n\nThe clipping can also be debunked using several other clues. The ludicrousness of the claim itself should raise doubts. The lack of media reports on the alleged statement further espouses its falseness. Lastly, the clipping has been made to resemble a newspaper cut-out, however, a quick glance is sufficient to reveal that it is manufactured.\n\n1. The article has spelling and grammatical errors. In the title itself, the word \u2018\u091a\u091f\u093e\u2019 is spelt \u2018\u091a\u093e\u091f\u093e\u2019. In the second paragraph, the word \u2018\u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u2018 is spelt \u2018\u0928\u0939\u0940\u2019. The sentence \u2013 \u201c\u090f\u0915 \u091c\u0928\u0938\u092d\u093e \u0915\u094b \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092c\u094b\u0927\u093f\u0924 \u0915\u0930\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0941\u090f \u091a\u0921\u094d\u0921\u093e \u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0939\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u201c\u092f\u0926\u093f \u092a\u0902\u091c\u093e\u092c\u0940 \u0938\u092e\u0941\u0926\u093e\u092f \u0915\u093e \u0936\u0924 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u0936\u0924 \u0935\u094b\u091f\u2026\u201d \u2013 does not have a comma before the direct quote. In fact, none of the direct quotes in the article starts with a comma.\n\n2. The report is not dated.\n\n3. The article does not have a byline. All reports published in newspapers either carry the author\u2019s name or mention that it is written by their bureau. In case the article is a news agency feed, the organisation\u2019s name \u2013 for instance, PTI, ANI \u2013 is mentioned.\n\n4. The sentences and paragraphs in the report are not perfectly aligned.\n\nCirculating fake newspaper clipping is commonplace on social media. Any article that resembles a news report is a tactic to mislead readers into believing that the information is true. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was also targeted on social media using a fake newspaper clipping.", "lang": "en"}
