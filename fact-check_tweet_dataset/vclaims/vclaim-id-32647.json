The waves eventually flood the streets. The videos have been captioned as, \"Last night, marine lines. Mumbai.\"\n\nThe set of videos was also sent to BOOM\u2019s helpline number for verification.\n\nThe videos can be viewed below.\n\nThe same footage is viral on social media with a similar false narrative.\n\nBOOM was able to ascertain that the video is not from Mumbai as structures from the area did not match with Mumbai\u2019s Marine Drive area. Furthermore, in one of the videos, the beach road has been identified as Al Bahri Road, which is in Muscat, Oman.\n\nWe also found dome like structures erected on the beach road of Al-Bahri, that matched with the ones present in the videos. The area is also known as Muttrah Corniche, a shore jutting out to the sea, and an ideal location for taking pictures by tourists.\n\nWe then looked up with relevant keywords and found that the same videos were uploaded on social media last week by Oman news portals, as footage of cyclone Kyarr, that hit the east coastal towns of UAE and Oman.\n\nMultiple areas of Oman were submerged after heavy rains lashed out in the cities as cyclone Kyarr intensified in the area.", "lang": "en"}
