They assumed that Bhasker was referring to the Kashmir \u201chuman shield\u201d incident. Among the many who attacked her were the ones followed by senior BJP leaders like Smriti Irani, Piyush Goyal\u2019s office and BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya (1, 2, 3, 4).\n\nThere were also several others followed by PM Modi (1,2,3,4).\n\nA Twitter user @dishasatra , who is followed by Piyush Goyal\u2019s Office, responded to Bhasker by posting a picture of herself in a t-shirt with the image of the man who was tied to a jeep in Kashmir and the caption \u2013 \u201cIndian army saving your ass whether you like it or not.\u201d Her post was retweeted nearly 7,000 times.\n\nThe t-shirt is sold by an e-commerce website tshirtbhaiya.com, owned by BJP Delhi spokesperson Tajinder Singh Bagga. After Bhasker\u2019s tweet went viral due to the enormous right-wing backlash, Bagga began giving discounts on his \u201chuman shield\u201d t-shirt using the hashtag #SwaraKoMirchiLagi.\n\nTwitter user Gaurav Pradhan also lashed out on Bhasker and abused her father, a former naval officer. Pradhan is followed by PM Modi and Piyush Goyal Office\u2019s on Twitter.\n\nAnother user followed by Piyush Goyal\u2019s office tweeted an email of a criminal complaint filed by his organisation \u201cIndia Against Biased Media\u201d against Bhasker. The complaint has been filed under IPC Section 124A (sedition).\n\nThe actress\u2019 tweet was also picked up by Postcard News, HMP News and Satya Vijayi, who wrote articles saying that the actress abused the Indian army.\n\nWhat was Swara Bhasker\u2019s tweet really about?\n\nAfter self-styled Godman Sadhguru\u2019s comment that \u201cliberals are fanatics\u201d, Swara Bhasker sent out a series of tweets using the hashtags #ButLiberalsAreFanatics#SadhguruSays. She made out multiple tweets related to atrocities that took place across the country in recent times.\n\nHer tweet on \u201cass***** tied men to jeep\u201d was not related to Major Gogoi or the Indian army but the 2016 Una flogging where seven members of a Dalit family were tied to a jeep and beaten with iron rods for skinning a dead cow. The actress clarified the same on Twitter after her post was completely misinterpreted.\n\nSwara Bhasker has often found herself in the crosshairs of the right-wing who target her for her vocal views on certain issues. She has also been a repeated victim of misinformation with morphed tweets and fake quotes circulated in her name.", "lang": "en"}
