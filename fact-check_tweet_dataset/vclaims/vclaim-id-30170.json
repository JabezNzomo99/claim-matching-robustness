{"title": "Trump Falsely Claims That Ukraine Aid Arrived \u2018Ahead of Schedule\u2019 (Published 2020)", "subtitle": "The president also made inaccurate claims on Tuesday about ISIS fighters and his record on the Iraq war.", "author": "www.nytimes.com", "date": "2020-01-08T00:09:01.000Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-30170", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/us/politics/trump-ukraine-aid-fact-check.html", "vclaim": "Congress had appropriated $391 million in military assistance to Ukraine \u2014 $250 million from the Pentagon and $141 million from the State Department \u2014 meant to be spent by the end of September. Though the Pentagon announced its plans to provide the aid in June, White House officials blocked its release in July. It remained frozen until mid-September, when Mr. Trump relented after pressure from lawmakers and administration officials.\n\nWith just two weeks left in the fiscal year, the Pentagon was unable to fully disburse the funds. According to testimony from Mark Sandy, an official in the Office of Management and Budget, about $35 million was left unspent. Congress then extended the deadline to the 2020 fiscal year to allow for the disbursement of the remaining aid.\n\n\u201cHad that provision not been included, then any unobligated funds as of Sept. 30 would have expired,\u201d Mr. Sandy said.\n\n\u201cWe have thousands of ISIS prisoners that we\u2019re keeping right now under lock and key. And we want Europe to take many of these prisoners because they came from Germany, France and other places \u2014 probably a few from Greece, in all fairness.\u201d\n\nThis is exaggerated. Estimates from Mr. Trump\u2019s own administration show that he is overstating the share of Islamic State fighters who hail from Europe.", "lang": "en"}
