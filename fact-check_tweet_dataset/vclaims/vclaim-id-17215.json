The video posted by Facebook page 'All About Geography' said this is from the South of Saudi Arabian border. It says, \"This is not water This is Sand Yes sand. It\u2019s called Allen Alkhai desert.\"\n\nThe archive version can be seen here.\n\nIndia Today\u2019s Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found it to be a wrong claim. This is not a visual of Allen Alkhai desert, but Lake Nahuel Huapi in Argentina which was filled with ash from the Puyehue-Cordon Caulle volcano of Chile in 2011.\n\nThe video posted on 'All About Geography', was shared by nearly 1.5 lakh users. Other Facebook pages like Biology and Environment have also posted the same video along with the same claim.\n\nWith the help of keyword search, we found several mainstream articles from news websites like The Telegraph and ABC News which have the same video.\n\nAll these articles, along with National Geographic, reported that the ash spewed by Chile\u2019s Puyehue volcano blanketed the Nahuel Huapi lakeshore in Bariloche, Argentina, near the Chilean border on June 12, 2011.\n\nHence, it is confirmed that the viral claim of a desert in the south of Saudia Arabia is not true. It is a video of an Argentinean lake along the Chile border covered with volcanic ash.", "lang": "en"}
