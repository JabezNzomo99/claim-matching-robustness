Most of the claims are incorrect, although some are accurate.\n\nGrenfell Tower was part of a housing complex in West Kensington, London. On 14 June 2017 a fire broke out in the tower, which caused the deaths of 72 people. There is an ongoing public inquiry examining the circumstances surrounding the fire.\n\nGrenfell Tower was built in 1974, not 2007-2008, in the London Borough Council of Kensington and Chelsea. Since 1964, when this borough was formed, the council has always been controlled by the Conservative party, though there was a national Labour government in 1974, led by Harold Wilson.\n\nWork on the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower took place between 2014 and 2016.\n\nSadiq Khan was born in 1970, meaning that he would have been three or four years old at the time the Tower was built. He was the MP for Tooting between 2005 and 2016 and had several ministerial roles in that time, but has never served as the Minister of Housing.\n\nSadiq Khan commissioned a report into the resourcing of the London Fire Brigade, to \u201cassess the impact of cuts made to the service under Boris Johnson on the ability of the service to keep Londoners safe\u201d. This report, written by Anthony Mayer (a former Chief Executive of the Greater London Authority) and published in November 2016, said that the London Fire Brigade \u201ccoped well\u201d with the funding reductions.\n\nThe report recommended that the budget should not be increased, but that there should be no further reduction either.\n\nWe have contacted the Mayor\u2019s office for more information.\n\nThe external cladding on Grenfell Tower has been identified by the Grenfell Tower inquiry as being \u201cthe primary cause of the rapid spread of fire\u201d during the disaster. The cladding, added to the building in 2015, was composed of Aluminium Composite Material (ACM) panels with a polyethylene (PE) core.\n\nThis type cladding is reportedly banned on buildings over 40 feet across most, but not all, jurisdictions of the USA. Grenfell Tower was 220 feet tall.\n\nWe can find no evidence linking Ed Miliband to the cladding on the tower. A report on the strategies for greener homes was produced under Ed Miliband as Secretary of State of Energy and Climate change, but it does not make any recommendations about cladding.\n\nThe type of cladding proposed to be used in the refurbishment of the tower was changed during the refurbishment process to a cheaper version.\n\nIn 2017, the Daily Mail claimed that Grenfell tower\u2019s cladding was put in place to meet green energy efficiency targets. But a fact check from Carbon Brief argues that the reporting by Daily Mail was \u201chighly selective and misleading\u201d and that the primary reasons for change to Grenfell Tower mentioned by the council were not green energy targets.\n\nAn Express article cited 2010 EU regulations for building\u2019 energy consumption in relation to the fire, but did not offer evidence of the link.\n\nThis claim appears to have originated from Twitter posts (one of which has since been deleted) which said that \u201cOn June 7, 2005, @jeremycorbyn voted to exempt tower blocks built before 2007 from requiring sprinklers\u201d. However, there were no votes in the Commons on this date. The regulations linked to in the tweets\u2014The Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005\u2014are a type of legislation known as a \u201cstatutory instrument\u201d, which are often not voted on. And these regulations don\u2019t mention the sprinklers at all.\n\nThe regulations that actually govern sprinklers in buildings are known as \u201cApproved Document B (fire safety)\u201d, which were changed in 2007 to make sprinklers compulsory in new buildings more than 30m high. This did not apply to existing buildings, however. These regulations were also not voted on.", "lang": "en"}
