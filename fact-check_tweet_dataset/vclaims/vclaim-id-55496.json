But a complaint from an intelligence community whistleblower has made Trump a new focal point of the story, and news reports have zeroed in on interactions between Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nTrump and his allies have hammered away at Biden \u2014 a potential opponent in the 2020 presidential election \u2014 charging that he and his son Hunter had acted improperly in dealings with Ukraine when the elder Biden was vice president and the younger Biden was a paid director of a Ukrainian company.\n\nIn May, PolitiFact and other fact-checkers found little substance to these allegations. Hunter Biden did do work in Ukraine, but we found nothing to suggest Vice President Biden acted to help him.\n\nNow, Democrats see the reported details about Trump\u2019s interactions with Zelensky as efforts to bully a foreign country into doing something helpful for his re-election campaign, possibly using U.S. military aid to Ukraine as leverage. And that has them talking impeachment.\n\n\"We may very well have crossed the Rubicon here,\" House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union.\n\nMuch is unknown so far about what Trump may have said to Zelensky, since the whistleblower complaint has not yet been made public.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at two broad subjects: first, the actions taken by Trump and their possible legal risks, and second, the underlying allegations against the Bidens. (Skip to Hunter and Joe Biden, and Ukraine, explained)\n\nWhat did Trump allegedly do regarding Biden and Ukraine?\n\nIn a July 25 phone call, Trump reportedly asked President Volodymyr Zelensky about eight times to work with Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani on a probe of the Bidens, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. The Washington Post and New York Times also published similar reports.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the discussion included a quid pro quo. The Washington Post on Sept. 18 reported that Trump\u2019s interaction with a foreign leader, later identified in subsequent reports as Zelensky, included an unspecified \"promise.\"\n\nSome media outlets have suggested that Trump\u2019s apparent request to Zelensky is linked to the United States reportedly slow-walking the delivery of $250 million in military aid to Ukraine.\n\nTrump has denied telling the Ukrainian president that he would only get U.S. aid if he investigated Hunter Biden.\n\n\"You will see, I did not ask for ... I did not make a statement that 'you have to do this or I will not give you aid,' \" Trump said during a Sept. 23 exchange with reporters at the United Nations General Assembly. \"I wouldn't do that.\" (Editor\u2019s note: On Sept. 24, Trump said that he did withhold military aid from Ukraine, but said it was because other countries weren\u2019t contributing their fair share.)\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community, told lawmakers during a closed session the conduct in question \"involves more than one episode and is based on a series of events,\" according to several people who attended or were briefed on Atkinson\u2019s meeting with Congress. It\u2019s unclear what those additional episodes might entail.\n\nWhat do we know about the whistleblower?\n\nThe whistleblower has not been identified. What we do know is that an unnamed intelligence official filed the whistleblower complaint Aug. 12 to Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community. Atkinson found the complaint credible and a matter of \"urgent concern,\" according to a letter from Schiff, the Democratic committee chairman.\n\nTrump said he did not know the whistleblower\u2019s identity. During an exchange with reporters Sept. 20 at the White House, he said, \"I just hear it\u2019s a partisan person.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s a ridiculous story. It\u2019s a partisan whistleblower,\" Trump said. \"It\u2019s just another political hack job.\"\n\nIn what way would Trump\u2019s actions be problematic under the law?\n\nThe framers of the Constitution gave the president a wide berth when it comes to conducting foreign affairs on the country\u2019s behalf. But the president\u2019s latitude is not absolute.\n\nExperts told PolitiFact that Trump\u2019s interactions with the Ukrainian president could be problematic if they amounted to self-dealing.\n\n\"The framers even recognized that there would be a point at which a president sought to use that authority to personally enrich himself, either financially or politically,\" said Kel McClanahan, a national security lawyer. \"The remedy for such personal enrichment was impeachment.\"\n\n\"If the allegations are true that Trump demanded an investigation into the Biden family in exchange for military aid that was already approved for Ukraine, that could constitute bribery, which is specifically listed in the constitution as a basis for impeachment,\" said Barbara McQuade, a University of Michigan law professor who was U.S attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan appointed by President Barack Obama.\n\nThe exchange between Trump and Zelensky has renewed the discussion of impeachment that had faded after Special Counsel Robert Mueller found the Trump administration had not colluded in Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference, and the Justice Department declined to prosecute the president for possibly obstructing justice.\n\nIs Congress entitled to view the contents of the complaint?\n\nThis question doesn\u2019t have a clear-cut answer \u2014 as is often the case when dealing with a national security question where the separation of powers between Congress and the Executive Branch is concerned.\n\nTo recap: A whistleblower complaint was lodged to the inspector general of the intelligence community. Democratic lawmakers on the intelligence committees then asked to see the complaint. When the acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire refused, it touched off a tense standoff between lawmakers and the Trump administration.\n\nAs House Intelligence Committee chairman, Schiff argued that the complaint must be turned over under the whistleblower statute.\n\n\"The whistleblower protection statute says that the director of national intelligence \u2018shall\u2019 produce the complaint to Congress if the inspector general finds the complaint credible and log urgent concern,\" McQuade said. \"That has happened.\"\n\nLawyers at the DNI countered that the complained-about conduct falls outside the scope of whistleblower statute, so it doesn\u2019t need to be given to Congress. The DNI also hinted at the possibility that executive privilege might apply.\n\nGuidance from past Supreme Court rulings is of limited use to navigate the current impasse, experts said.\n\nIn the landmark 1974 case involving President Richard Nixon\u2019s attempt to assert executive privilege over the Watergate tapes, the justices ruled that the scope of presidential power is not so broad as to allow a president to withhold information that is critical to an ongoing criminal investigation. But that case didn\u2019t deal directly with what happens when it\u2019s Congress who\u2019s seeking the information.\n\n\"In this case, with the investigators being outside of the executive branch, and the investigation not being a criminal one,\" McClanahan said, \"the lawyers on both sides can both pull support from that case with no clearly \u2018right\u2019 answer.\"\n\nThen-Vice President Joe Biden in Beijing with his granddaughter Finnegan Biden and son Hunter Biden in 2013. (AP)\n\nWhat was Hunter Biden\u2019s role at a Ukrainian company?\n\nHunter Biden held a directorship with a natural gas company called Burisma Holdings, beginning in the spring of 2014.\n\nReuters reported at the time that a statement on the company\u2019s website said the younger Biden would help the company with \"transparency, corporate governance and responsibility, international expansion,\" and other issues. The company also retained the law firm where Biden had been working, Boies Schiller Flexner.\n\nThe position with Burisma came at a time when the younger Biden had joined with Christopher Heinz (the stepson of then-Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.) and Devon Archer (a Kerry family friend) in a string of investment and consulting firms. Firms run by Biden and Archer \"pursued business with international entities that had a stake in American foreign policy decisions, sometimes in countries where connections implied political influence and protection,\" the New York Times reported.\n\nBiden\u2019s Burisma directorship attracted attention because Burisma was owned by Mykola Zlochevsky, a minister under Russia-friendly President Viktor F. Yanukovych, who subsequently went into exile after a popular revolution. After Yanukovych was ousted, Zlochevsky faced a variety of corruption-related investigations involving his business.\n\nIn 2015, Ukraine\u2019s newly appointed prosecutor general Viktor Shokin inherited some of the investigations into Zlochevsky and his company. (Zlochevsky and the company have denied the allegations.) Shokin was ousted as prosecutor in 2016.\n\nIn May 2019, Shokin\u2019s successor, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Bloomberg that \"Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws \u2014 at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing.\"\n\nWas the Ukrainian oil company Hunter Biden worked for under investigation?\n\nAt times, Burisma has attracted attention from investigators. Despite the Trump camp\u2019s suggestions, however, it\u2019s not clear that Burisma was actively under investigation during the period when Biden was involved with the company. Key figures have said opposing things on that point.\n\nIn an interview with the Ukrainian website Strana.ua, Shokin said the cases were indeed active.\n\nBut Vitaliy Kasko, who had been Shokin\u2019s deputy overseeing international cooperation, produced documents to Bloomberg that under Shokin, the investigation into Burisma had been dormant. Kasko resigned in February 2016 citing corruption in the office.\n\n\"There was no pressure from anyone from the U.S. to close cases against Zlochevsky,\" Kasko told Bloomberg. \"It was shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015.\"\n\nDid Joe Biden know about his son\u2019s Ukrainian ties?\n\nJoe Biden knew his son was working for the company, but no evidence has emerged that they discussed the substance of his work.\n\nIn a White House press briefing on May 13, 2014, spokesman Jay Carney was asked about Hunter Biden\u2019s position with Burisma and whether it presented the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nCarney said, \"I would refer you to the Vice President\u2019s office. I saw those reports. Hunter Biden and other members of the Biden family are obviously private citizens and where they work does not reflect an endorsement by the administration or by the Vice President or President. But I would refer you to the Vice President\u2019s office.\"\n\nA year and a half later, the New York Times published an article that suggested that \"the credibility of the vice president\u2019s anti-corruption message may have been undermined\" by Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings with the company. In that 2015 article, Kate Bedingfield, a spokeswoman for Biden, played down any impact on the elder Biden\u2019s policies.\n\nFour years later, speaking to reporters on Sept. 21, Biden said, \"I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.\"\n\nThat tracked with what Hunter Biden told the New York Times in a statement earlier this year \u2014 that \"at no time have I discussed with my father the company\u2019s business, or my board service, including my initial decision to join the board.\"\n\nHowever, in a New Yorker magazine profile published in July 2019, Hunter Biden acknowledged that in December 2015, the elder Biden discussed Burisma with him one time: \"Dad said, \u2018I hope you know what you are doing,\u2019 and I said, \u2018I do.\u2019\"\n\nTrump characterized Biden\u2019s comment about never speaking to his son about the company as a \"lie.\"\n\nThe Biden camp says the comment cited in the New Yorker article was not substantive in nature.\n\nWhat did Joe Biden urge the Ukrainian government to do?\n\nBiden proudly recounted a threat he made to withhold aid unless Shokin was sacked. Biden said the incumbent prosecutor was failing to aggressively pursue allegations of corruption in Ukraine.\n\nDuring an event sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations on Jan. 23, 2018, Biden made the following remarks, which at points were accompanied by laughter from the audience:\n\n\"I remember going over (to Ukraine), convincing our team \u2026 that we should be providing for loan guarantees. \u2026 And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from (then Ukrainian President Petro) Poroshenko and from (then-Prime Minister Arseniy) Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor (Shokin). And they didn\u2019t. ...\n\n\"They were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, ... we\u2019re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, \u2018You have no authority. You\u2019re not the president.\u2019 \u2026 I said, call him. I said, I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you\u2019re not getting the billion. ... I looked at them and said, \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money.\u2019 Well, son of a b----. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\"\n\nShokin\u2019s ouster came in March 2016, when he was stripped of his position by a wide margin in the legislature.\n\nDid Joe Biden act improperly to shield Burisma for his son?\n\nBiden was hardly alone in calling for Shokin\u2019s ouster. Western leaders and institutions were largely united in seeking Shokin\u2019s removal, arguing that he was not pursuing corruption cases aggressively.\n\nFor instance, in early 2016, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde said that \"it\u2019s hard to see how the I.M.F.-supported program can continue\" unless corruption prosecutions accelerate.\n\nSteven Pifer is a career foreign service officer who was ambassador to Ukraine under President Bill Clinton and deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs under President George W. Bush. Pifer told PolitiFact that \"virtually everyone\" he knew in the U.S. government and virtually all non-governmental experts on Ukraine \"felt that Shokin was not doing his job and should be fired. As far as I can recall, they all concurred with the vice president telling Poroshenko that the U.S. government would not extend the $1 billion loan guarantee to Ukraine until Shokin was removed from office.\"\n\nAnders \u00c5slund, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington, agreed that criticism of Shokin was widespread\n\nShokin \"failed to prosecute anybody of significance, protecting both the Yanukovych circle and the Poroshenko group,\" \u00c5slund told PolitiFact in May.\n\nDaria Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, a leading anti-corruption voice in Ukraine, tweeted earlier this year that Shokin\u2019s firing was not about protecting the company Hunter Biden was working for.\n\nDid Hunter Biden put his father in a difficult ethical position?\n\nThere is wide agreement among Ukraine policy experts that Hunter Biden\u2019s decision to become a director for Burisma presented a serious conflict of interest.\n\n\"It\u2019s not a crime, but it is a lapse. It\u2019s troubling,\" said Lincoln A. Mitchell, an adjunct research scholar at Columbia University\u2019s Arnold A. Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies who has written about governance in the former Soviet Union.\n\nPifer, who expressed reservations about the arrangement to the New York Times in 2015, said subsequent developments have only confirmed those concerns.\n\n\"It was a mistake for Hunter Biden to join the Burisma board, particularly given that the vice president was the senior U.S. official engaging Ukraine,\" Pifer said. \"Hunter Biden should have been more mindful of his father's position.\"\n\nAnd Yoshiko Herrera, a University of Wisconsin professor who previously headed the university\u2019s Center for Russia, East Europe and Central Asia, said Hunter Biden\u2019s hiring echoes the strategy common within Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union, in which powerful interests try to secure influence on foreign policy by leveraging family members and associates of key leaders.\n\n\"Calling Hunter Biden a private citizen ignores the obvious links to the vice president,\" Herrera said. \"Conflict-of-interest rules should have applied. If Biden is working for the Obama administration on Ukraine, his son should not have been on the board of a company there that could be affected by U.S. policy spearheaded by his father.\"\n\nRELATED STORY: Here's the readout of Donald Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\n\nRELATED STORY: What the whistleblower law says about sharing complaints with Congress\n\nRELATED STORY: Donald Trump said European nations have not put money into Ukraine.
