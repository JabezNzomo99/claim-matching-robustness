Captain Deepak Vasant Sathe was the pilot-in-command of ill-fated Dubai-Kozhikode Air India Express flight that crashed on \u20187 August 2020\u2019 in Kerala. Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of late Air India Express flight Captain Deepak Vasant Sathe, singing a Bollywood song on the stage. Fact: The officer singing on the stage in the video is Retired Vice Admiral Girish Luthra, not the late Air India Express Captain Deepak Vasant Sathe. On the occasion of Indian Western Navy Command celebrating its Golden Jubilee, Girish Luthra sung the Udit Narayan\u2019s iconic \u2018Ghar se Nikalthe hi\u2019 song on the stage. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn comparing the photo of the officer shown in the video with that of Captain Deepak Vasant Sathe, we found out that both are not similar at all. Also, by observing the uniform of the officer in the video, it is understood that he is an officer of the Indian Navy. When we searched for more information using these keywords, we found the same video in an article published by \u2018The Quint\u2019 news website on \u201807 March 2019\u2019. In the article, it is mentioned that Vice Admiral Girish Luthra chose to sing the Udit Narayan\u2019s iconic \u2018Ghar se nikalthe hi\u2019 song on the special occasion of the Indian Western Navy Command celebrating its \u2018Golden Jubilee\u2019-50 years. The same video was found in the official YouTube channel of Girish Luthra.\n\nOn \u201807 August 2020\u2019, Air India Express flight from Dubai carrying 190 passengers overshot the runaway in Kozhikode airport in Kerala. Captain Deepak Vasant Sathe, the pilot-in command of the Air India Express flight, died along with 17 others in this accident.\n\nTo sum it up, retired Vice Admiral Girish Luthra\u2019s singing video is falsely shared as that of late Air India Express Captain Deepak Vasant Sathe.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
