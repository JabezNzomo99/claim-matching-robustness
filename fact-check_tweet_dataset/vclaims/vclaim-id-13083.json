{"title": "Does NSW have the highest power prices in the developed world?", "subtitle": "", "author": "factcheck.aap.com.au", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-13083", "url": "https://factcheck.aap.com.au/claims/does-nsw-have-the-highest-power-prices-in-the-developed-world", "vclaim": "\"Power prices in NSW are the highest in the developed world\".\n\nAAP FactCheck examined NSW Labor\u2019s campaign claim that NSW power prices are the most expensive in the developed world. [1]\n\nAAP FactCheck found no evidence to support the claim.\n\nThe United Nations classifies countries into one of three broad categories: developed economies, economies in transition and developing economies. Developed countries include the European Union, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. [2]\n\nNSW Labor did not respond to AAP FactCheck requests to provide a source for its campaign claim.\n\nA NSW Labor Facebook post on March 20, 2019 about electricity prices uses a headline from a July 2016 report in The Sunday Telegraph which states \u201cPower shock: NSW families pay highest electricity prices in the world\u201d. [3]\n\nThe story quotes \u201cnew research by a leading economics consultancy\u201d and states the \u201cinternational price comparison by Melbourne-based CME was done for One Big Switch\u201d. The story further states News Corp Australia, publisher of The Sunday Telegraph, is a shareholder of One Big Switch. [4]\n\nAAP FactCheck examined the same report from the same independent Australian economics consultancy CME Carbon + Energy Markets MarkIntell dated July 2016 and found Victoria and South Australia both had more expensive electricity prices than NSW and most households in Europe, Great Britain, Japan and the United States. [5]\n\nAn August 2017 report from the the same Carbon + Energy Markets' MarkIntell consultancy showed South Australia had the highest electricity prices in the world. NSW was ranked fifth most expensive on the MarkIntell table behind Denmark, Germany and Italy. [6]\n\nTwo other reports showed South Australia, not NSW, has the most expensive electricity prices compared to other Australian states and developed countries.\n\nA 2018 list of countries and regions with the highest electricity prices, based on figures from Finnish research and advisory firm VaasaEtt and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), ranked South Australia third behind Germany (number two) and Denmark (number one). NSW was ranked fifth after Spain.\n\nGerman data provider Statista, which published the list, noted \u201cthe situation is a far cry from 2004, when Australia claimed the fourth cheapest electricity prices in the OECD\u201d. [7]\n\nAccording to the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) 2018 annual report which compared electricity price trends among Australian states, South Australia had the highest prices with NSW second in 2017/2018. The AEMC report titled Residential Electricity Price Trends further predicted NSW would drop from second highest to third behind South Australia and West Australia in 2018/19. The AEMC annual reports are prepared at the request of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Energy Council.\n\nThe AEMC report also predicted NSW residents would reap further price savings as the NSW Government was \u201cdelivering a range of new programs to provide clean and affordable energy for the people of NSW. These programs will assist households and businesses to save money on their energy bills.\u201d [8]\n\nTwo other reports which compared Australian electricity prices with developed countries showed Australia was far from the most expensive.\n\nA 2017 ACCC report which compared retail electricity prices among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries found Australia was one of the cheapest. In a list of 30 countries Australia was the 22nd most expensive or the eighth cheapest based on 2016 electricity prices. Portugal was the most expensive and Norway was the cheapest. [9]\n\nInternational Energy Agency statistics on world energy prices for the first quarter of 2018 showed Australia was ranked eighth most expensive among 35 developed nations for household electricity prices per megawatt-hour. Megawatt-hour is the period of time for which the amount of electrical power is used. [10]", "lang": "en"}
