This warning language is not in the new online form.\n\nIn the case of the Ukraine whistleblower, he wrote that he \u201cwas not a direct witness to most of the events\u201d recounted in the complaint. But Michael Atkinson, the current inspector general for intelligence, said that even without access to the memo of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Atkinson\u2019s preliminary review found that the complaint \u201cappears credible,\u201d including that Trump sought to pressure the Ukrainian president to help with his reelection bid.\n\nOn its face, it makes little sense for an IG to refuse secondhand information at the initial stage because an IG, like a prosecutor or a journalist, is looking for leads, not merely for admissible evidence. Both versions of the form allowed for the submission of secondhand information, as provided in the guiding policy documents. The older form merely had a stronger warning that the tip would need to be verified by the IG before it could be deemed credible, perhaps to discourage complaints from people soon to be terminated or disciplined.\n\nAlthough the form requests information about whether the Complainant possesses first-hand knowledge about the matter about which he or she is lodging the complaint, there is no such requirement set forth in the statute. In fact, by law the Complainant \u2013 or any individual in the Intelligence Community who wants to report information with respect to an urgent concern to the congressional intelligence committees \u2013 need not possess first-hand information in order to file a complaint or information with respect to an urgent concern. The ICIG cannot add conditions to the filing of an urgent concern that do not exist in law.\n\nIn any case, the IG\u2019s process for handling whistleblower allegations is determined not by a form but by the law and related policy documents. The key document, ICD 120, has been virtually unchanged since 2014. Contrary to the speculation, the whistleblower used the 2018 form, not the new online form. The IG then investigated and found that his allegations were credible and that Congress should be notified.", "lang": "en"}
