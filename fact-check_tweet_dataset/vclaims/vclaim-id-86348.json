Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Then, as now, he briefed the media about the situation. Here\u2019s Fauci in a video answering questions about the swine flu.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that from April 12, 2009, to April 10, 2010, there were 12,469 deaths in the United States because of the H1N1 (swine flu) virus. That was the midpoint of an estimate that ranged from a low of 8,868 to a high of 18,306. As we noted, Trump often cites this figure as 17,000.\n\nOnly after the swine flu pandemic had passed did researchers use a time series analysis to estimate how many excess deaths in a given period could be attributed to the swine flu but were not counted in the official death statistics. About 6 in 7 deaths are believe to have been missed in the laboratory-confirmed count during the swine-flu pandemic, though such calculations count any death in which the flu might have been a contributing factor. Many deaths are triggered by the flu but occur later, via secondary bacterial infection or exacerbation of underlying chronic diseases, even as flu symptoms may have disappeared.\n\nA New York Times assessment in 2010 noted that some flaws in the system were discovered, but overall the government was praised for its response \u2014 in part because it turned out that the pandemic was not as severe as it once had appeared. The President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology in August 2009 had forecast 30,000 to 90,000 deaths, and the final death toll was much less than that.\n\n\u201cEven though the six-month goals for initial vaccine delivery were met, most of the vaccine arrived too late to vaccinate much of the public before the pandemic peaked,\u201d the Health and Human Services Department concluded in a lengthy 2012 report, noting that early projections \u201cregarding timing of vaccine supply changed frequently and were inaccurate. This led to public confusion and temporary erosion of confidence in the federal government, and created challenges for the planning and execution of local vaccine administration efforts.\u201d\n\nBut, in a bit of luck, it turned out that just one dose was effective, rather than the anticipated two, so the supply that was produced went twice as far. Because the flu turned out to be relatively mild, hospitals were not as stressed as they might have been expected.\n\nThe HHS, in its report, noted that \u201cserendipity\u201d played a big role in the successful outcome. \u201cBecause the pandemic could have been worse, 2009 H1N1 did not test the nation\u2019s response capabilities to its limits,\u201d the report warned. \u201cBecause the health care system was not seriously stressed during the pandemic, its ability to meet a substantial surge in demand was not fully tested and the difficult issues around allocation of scarce resources and crisis standards of care in an emergency did not have to be confronted. If the health care system had been tested to its limits, serious problems may have emerged because the public health and health care delivery systems are not well prepared to address such issues.\u201d\n\nReviewing this history, we can only assume that Trump has not studied the swine-flu pandemic very closely. He simply heard a death-toll figure \u2014 remembering it incorrectly \u2014 and presumably concluded that anything associated with Obama was a debacle. But in reality, the government under Obama worked relatively smoothly, even if it was not tested as in the current pandemic.\n\nAs of April 3, when we last updated the database, Trump had criticized Obama\u2019s handling of the swine flu 10 times. Including this most recent tweet, the count now stands at 14. It\u2019s a mystery why Trump persists in this false attack when the facts have turned against him, but this Four-Pinocchio claim looks like it will quickly be another Bottomless Pinocchio.", "lang": "en"}
