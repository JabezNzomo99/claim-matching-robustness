RMIT ABC Fact Check investigates.\n\n\n\nMs Berejiklian's claim is overblown, while Ms Mikakos's claim amounts to a fair call.\n\nWhen the NSW premier made her claim (May 14), NSW ranked 22nd in the world for its cumulative testing rate, and 20th for its daily rate.\n\nVictoria, meanwhile, was at 18th place in cumulative terms and had cracked the top three for daily tests.\n\nNotably, NSW was counting the number of people tested, while Victoria was counting tests conducted.\n\nWere both reporting the same thing, they may have placed roughly equal in cumulative terms.\n\nIn daily terms, though, Victoria had already doubled NSW's test rate. It was soon leading the nation on both measures.\n\nBy the time Ms Mikakos made her claim (May 21), Victoria's total tests per thousand people was the 13th highest globally.\n\nThough not quite the second place her tweet implied, this rate was certainly among the world's highest.\n\nVictoria's rate for daily tests was fourth highest, behind Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Lithuania.\n\nBut such comparisons come with serious caveats. Not all countries count the same things or report as regularly, and it cannot be guaranteed that different test types have been excluded.\n\nMoreover, data is not available for every country.\n\nMs Mikakos said Victoria's testing was about \"seeing the extent of the virus's transmission in the community\".\n\nBroadly, there are two types of testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19.\n\nSerology tests can show whether someone has been exposed to the virus based on the presence of antibodies in their blood following an immune response.\n\nBut as the World Health Organisation explains, these tests are often possible only after a patient has recovered.\n\nViral tests, meanwhile, detect the virus itself.\n\nFact Check has assessed the claims on the basis of so-called PCR tests, which look for the presence of the virus's genetic material in a nasal or throat swab.\n\nThese are the most commonly used viral tests for coronavirus in Australia, and according to the national COVID-19 health guidelines (as they stood on May 22), are used to confirm new cases.\n\nNeither Ms Berejiklian nor Ms Mikakos specified whether they were referring to tests per day or cumulative tests to date.\n\nFact Check has assessed their claims on both measures.\n\nJohn Carlin, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Melbourne, told Fact Check that daily rates were \"the only way in which we can keep a handle on the intensity of effort that's going into monitoring the current rate of spread of the disease\".\n\nHe said cumulative rates showed the effort countries had put in over the longer term, \"but this will have been spread in very different ways over time\".\n\nCatherine Bennett, Deakin University's chair in epidemiology, said it made little sense to look at daily rates over time without also tracking policy changes.\n\nCumulative rates helped avoid short-term data fluctuations, she said, adding that while these rates would ideally be standardised to a common starting point (such as days since each country's 100th case), the differences from not doing so diminished as the pandemic went on.\n\nRamon Shaban, University of Sydney's clinical chair of infection prevention and disease control, said the important thing was to have \"a continuing high rate of testing that goes on in jurisdictions over time\", and it was this, combined with falling community transmission, that showed whether a country was actively looking for cases.\n\nBoth claimants compared their rates of \"testing\" to those of other countries. However, not all countries count the same thing.\n\nSome report the number of tests conducted, others the number of people tested. It is often not clear which method they are using.\n\nSince people can be tested more than once but must have had at least one test to be counted, Fact Check considers the number of people tested to reflect a jurisdiction's minimum possible test rate.\n\nIn Australia, where hospitalised coronavirus patients must meet certain conditions including the return of two negative tests before being released from isolation, states report the number of tests conducted.\n\nNSW was an exception. At the time of both claims, it counted the number of people tested, not the number of tests.\n\nThe state switched to counting tests on May 26, but unlike the other states and territories its counts still exclude follow-up tests for confirmed cases.\n\nTo compare Australia's states, Fact Check has used test counts from the Federal Government's weekly reports and daily snapshots. (Fact Check's daily counts for May 14 and May 21 reflect seven-day averages.)\n\nThe federal test numbers generally match those publicly announced by the Victorian and NSW health departments.\n\nSeparately, Data NSW also publishes daily test counts for the state.\n\nRates per thousand people were calculated using the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics population estimates, for September 2019.\n\nMs Mikakos claimed on May 21 that Victoria had among the world's highest test rates.\n\nThe numbers show South Australia led the nation in cumulative testing per capita until the week of May 10, with NSW just behind.\n\nThen, Victoria leapt ahead \u2014 overtaking NSW on May 12, then South Australia on May 14.\n\nVictoria's daily test rate averaged 1.9 per thousand people, nearly twice that of the runner-up, NSW.\n\nMs Berejiklian made her claim on May 14.\n\nIn a statement issued that same day, NSW Health announced the state had \"one of the highest testing rates in the world\".\n\nHowever, the numbers show both Victoria and South Australia already had higher cumulative rates than NSW. Importantly, NSW was at that stage still counting the number of people tested, not the number of tests.\n\nWhen it switched to counting tests on May 26, its total rate jumped by 8 per cent \u2014 well above the previous week's 2 per cent daily average increase.\n\nHad the switch happened earlier, a similar boost on May 14 would have put NSW roughly level with Victoria at the top for cumulative tests.\n\nHowever, it would have done little to dent Victoria's lead in the daily stakes, with the southern state already conducting, on average, twice as many daily tests per person as NSW.\n\nWho has the world's highest test rate is a vexed question.\n\nThere is no standardised reporting of COVID-19 test data, nor are numbers published by intergovernmental bodies such as the World Health Organisation.\n\nIn the absence of such a dataset, experts directed Fact Check to the websites Worldometer and Our World in Data.\n\nCited in Ms Mikakos's tweet, Our World in Data is run by Oxford University researchers and collates test figures from official government sources.\n\nDetailed information on these sources makes clear that countries report their data inconsistently, and there is often limited information about what is being counted.\n\nIllustrating the problem, the British Government has been accused of including tests \"posted out\" in its count.\n\nOur World in Data does not cover every country and is generally limited to PCR tests, though excluding other test types is not always possible.\n\nFact Check has based its assessment of the claims of Ms Berejiklian and Ms Mikakos primarily on the website's total rates and seven-day average test rates.\n\nWhere rates are marked as relating to \"samples tested\" or \"swabs tested\", Fact Check takes them to mean tests that have been conducted.\n\nWorldometer publishes COVID-19 test data for more than 100 jurisdictions not covered by Our World in Data, including many smaller territories (for example, Gibraltar, the Falkland Islands and the Isle of Man).\n\nIt compiles its numbers from both official and unofficial sources, and does not specify what is counted.\n\nFact Check has added four countries to the list compiled by Our World in Data using figures from official sources. These countries are Brunei, Cyprus, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nEach has populations larger than 100,000 people and were reported as having conducted more than 40 tests per thousand people, according to a Worldometer snapshot that used estimates up to May 21.\n\nTwo other countries also met this criteria (Mauritius and Malta), but Fact Check was unable to find official test counts for them.\n\nRates have been calculated using UN population estimates, which are also used by Our World in Data.\n\nMs Berejiklian suggested NSW was leading the world in her May 14 comments.\n\nBut its cumulative rate of 41.1 tests per thousand people didn't crack the top 20.\n\nMeanwhile, Victoria took 18th place with 43.7 tests per thousand people, according to Fact Check's analysis.\n\nBy May 21, when Ms Mikakos made her claim, NSW (48.2) had risen one place to 21st place and Victoria (57.1) had jumped to 13th place.\n\nMs Mikakos's tweet from that time showed only Iceland ahead of Victoria.\n\nIn fact, 12 countries outranked Victoria, and rates for several of them were based on days-old data.\n\nFive of those countries counted the number of people tested; or, it was not clear what was counted.\n\n\n\nWhen Ms Berejiklian made her claim, Victoria had already blazed ahead of NSW with its daily test rate.\n\nBased on averages for the week to May 14, Victoria was conducting 2.4 tests per day per thousand people. That was the third-highest rate globally, behind only by Bahrain (3.8) and the UAE (3.6).\n\nNSW took 20th place with 1.1 people per thousand tested each day.\n\nBy May 21, Victoria (1.9) had slipped one place, behind Bahrain (4.3), UAE (4.0) and Lithuania (2.3).\n\nNSW (1.0) had gained four spots to 16th place.\n\u2022 ABC News, NSW coronavirus borders war between Premier Gladys Berejiklian and WA's Mark McGowan intensifies, May 21, 2020\n\u2022 Johns Hopkins University, The facts about COVID-19 tests, accessed May 26, 2020\n\u2022 WHO, Scientific brief on COVID-19 testing, April 8, 2020\n\u2022 TGA, COVID-19 testing in Australia \u2014 information for health professionals, May 22, 2020\n\u2022 Data NSW, COVID-19 test data (by location and result), downloaded May 29\n\u2022 NSW Health, How does NSW Health count tests?, May 26, 2020\n\u2022 Sir David Nosgrove, Letter to UK secretary of state regarding test counts, June 2, 2020\n\u2022 Our World in Data, COVID-19 testing data and detailed sources, downloaded May 25, 2020\n\u2022 Our World in Data, Coronavirus (COVID-19) Testing, accessed May 25, 2020\n\u2022 Our World in Data, Coronavirus Testing \u2013 Source Data, accessed May 30, 2020\n\u2022 The COVID Tracking Project, Position statement on antibody data reporting, May 14, 2020", "lang": "en"}
