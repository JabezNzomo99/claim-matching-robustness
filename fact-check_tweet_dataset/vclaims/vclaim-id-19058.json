While demands for legislative action were quieter, there were some.\n\nIn the aftermath of many shootings, Democrats renew public calls for gun control, as they have in the aftermath of the recent mass shootings in Ohio and Texas.\n\nThat demand was notably more tempered after a 2017 shooting that targeted Republicans during a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia. The gunman shot and injured four people, including Louisiana Republican Rep. Steve Scalise, who was critically wounded.\n\nBut it\u2019s not the case, as a viral meme on Facebook claims, that \u201cnot one Democrat called for gun control\u201d following the shooting.\n\nThe day after the June 14, 2017, shooting, former Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords \u2014 who was shot in the head in 2011 and advocates for gun control \u2014 wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post calling for lawmakers to address gun violence.\n\n\u201cWe know, as always, that no one law could prevent a shooting like this. But we also know that we must acknowledge a problem: an unacceptable rate of gun violence in this country,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd we must acknowledge that a deadly problem like this brings a responsibility to find solutions.\u201d\n\nVirginia\u2019s then-Gov. Terry McAuliffe, also a Democrat, said during a press briefing the day of the shooting that \u201cwe need to do more to protect all of our citizens.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have long advocated \u2014 and this is not what today is about \u2014 but there are too many guns on the street,\u201d he said, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. A state gun rights group criticized McAuliffe for \u201c[n]ever missing a chance to push his gun control agenda.\u201d\n\nDemocrat Dannel Malloy, the governor of Connecticut at the time, called the shooting \u201ca reason why we need, quite frankly, and I\u2019ll say it, saner gun laws in America.\u201d\n\nStill, the response from gun-control advocates in Congress was noticeably quieter than it had been compared to other high-profile shootings \u2014 which some attributed to the politics of the situation. The shooter, who was killed by police, expressed anti-Republican views before the attack. Congressional leaders were taking efforts to demonstrate unity.\n\nThe \u201ctone was different than after past tragedies,\u201d an ABC News article observed. \u201cThere appeared to be a sensitivity that it was not the appropriate time to fight with their colleagues over policy.\u201d\n\nThere were subtle references to the need for gun safety, though.\n\n\u201cThis kind of mindless violence must stop, and I\u2019m dedicated to doing all I can to putting an end to these senseless tragedies,\u201d Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, of California, said in a June 14, 2017, statement. Feinstein routinely introduces measures to ban assault weapons.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2014 who was the Democratic House minority leader at the time \u2014 held a press conference the day after the shooting, in which she referenced the people who \u201close their lives to gun violence in America every day. Within many families and communities across America, the anguish that we are feeling personally in Congress today is altogether too familiar.\u201d\n\nAnswering a question about political vitriol, Pelosi at one point referred to inaction on the issue.\n\n\u201cI think our energy should be used in our thoughts and prayers for Steve Scalise and Mr. Mika, and that\u2019s really where our hearts are right now,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of gun safety that, you know, has never happened. Little babies, little children in kindergarten, were massacred and nothing happened.\u201d\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, a staunch supporter of gun control and Democrat from Connecticut, wrote in a June 15, 2017, Facebook post that \u201cwe are becoming massively desensitized to the carnage.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does it say about us as a country that we can so easily move on from such a seemingly cataclysmic event? Are we so jaundiced to gun violence and mass shootings that it only takes us twenty four hours now to revert back to business as usual,\u201d he said.\n\nHe then made clear that he would continue his push for gun control: \u201cBut after tonight\u2019s game, I\u2019ll get back to work. Because until the laws of this country change, the slaughter \u2014 and the risk of normalizing it all \u2014 won\u2019t stop.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
