Did you see her at the Oscars? She was terrific as the Minority Outreach Director, so we brought her on board. We\u2019re lucky to have her. She\u2019s controversial, but she\u2019s one of the good ones.\u201d\n\nThe above-displayed story is not true, and Trump has no outreach program with that name. This is a work of fiction from National Report, a well-known purveyor of fake news. A disclaimer on the site states that the publication is news and political satire:\n\nWhile Stacey Dash has not been hired by Donald Trump to run any type of outreach campaign, she did endorse the Republican presidential candidate, and is a supporter of the pro-Trump Great America PAC:", "lang": "en"}
