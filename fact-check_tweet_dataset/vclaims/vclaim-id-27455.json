Then Donald Trump Stepped In.\u201d A meme circulating on Facebook similarly described Trump\u2019s intervention:\n\n This claim apparently originated with Trump himself, or at least it was touted on his campaign website in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election. The website at the time stated:\n\nMr. Trump has long been a devoted supporter of veteran causes. In 1995, the fiftieth anniversary of World War II, only 100 spectators watched New York City\u2019s Veteran Day Parade. It was an insult to all veterans. Approached by Mayor Rudy Giuliani and the chief of New York City\u2019s FBI office, Mr. Trump agreed to lead as Grand Marshall a second parade later that year. Mr. Trump made a $1 million matching donation to finance the Nation\u2019s Day Parade. On Saturday, November 11th, over 1.4 million watched as Mr. Trump marched down Fifth Avenue with more than 25,000 veterans, some dressed in their vintage uniforms. A month later, Mr. Trump was honored in the Pentagon during a lunch with the Secretary of Defense and the entire Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nFirst off, Trump\u2019s website contained some confusing pieces of misinformation: The Veterans Day parade in New York City went by the name the \u201cNation\u2019s Parade.\u201d The poorly attended parade \u201cwith only 100 spectators\u201d occurred in 1994, not 1995 (The New York Times reported police did not give a crowd estimate). Only one Veteran\u2019s Day parade took place in the city in 1995 \u2014 the Nation\u2019s Parade on Nov. 11. That event was slated by the U.S. Defense Department as representing \u201cthe official close of the 50th anniversary of World War II.\u201d\n\nWe contacted the United War Veterans of New York (UWNY), which organized the Nation\u2019s Parade in 1995, to ask about claims that Trump\u2019s intervention saved the event from cancellation, and we were referred by spokesman Pat Smith to a Nov. 10, 1995, New York Times article about the event. Smith told us that Trump did make a financial contribution toward the parade, but also said UWNY is a small, volunteer-staffed group that doesn\u2019t keep records that could answer questions in detail about an event that occurred more than two decades ago.\n\nThe 1995 Times article reported that Trump did make a financial contribution, but that he tried to make it in exchange for being named the parade\u2019s grand marshal even though he is not a veteran. The Times reported Trump gave $200,000, not $1 million:\n\nBy mid-August, organizers had a bank account of exactly $1.21. A request to airlines to donate blankets for aging veterans was turned down because logos might not be visible on television. Then Donald Trump, a nonveteran, agreed to throw in $200,000 as well as raise money from his friends, in exchange for being named grand marshal. Since then, money has come in, though not enough to meet the original budget, which was reduced from $2.9 million to $2.4 million. Fireworks were just one of many cuts.\n\nIn May 2016, CNN spoke to Vincent McGowan, the president emeritus of UWNY who organized the parade in 1995. McGowan said that Trump\u2019s contribution was \u201csomewhere between $325,000 and $375,000,\u201d but McGowan also said Trump\u2019s donation did save the event. McGowan also said Trump was never the grand marshal because that honor was only given to military veterans.\n\nIn a follow-up story, the Times in 1995 reported that organizers had agreed to make Trump the parade\u2019s grand marshal, a move that had angered some veterans, while others expressed appreciation for his \u201ccrucial\u201d financial assistance:\n\nAnother story, dated Nov. 11, 1995, from the news service UPI, reported that Trump contributed $200,000 and raised another $300,000 for the parade, which was viewed by parade Director Tom Fox as having been key:\n\nPolice estimated 500,000 people attended the largest military parade ever held in New York. Organizers, who placed the turnout at closer to a million, said the parade would not have been a success if it hadn\u2019t been for real estate developer Donald Trump, who contributed $200,000 and raised another $300,000. \u201cDonald Trump saved the parade,\u201d said parade director Tom Fox, himself a Vietnam veteran. \u201cWe had asked for donations from 200 corporations, and none of them came through,\u201d he said. \u201cThis donation is the single most important thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d said a beaming Trump. \u201cThis is more important than all of my buildings and my casinos. This is my way of saying thank you to all the men and women in the armed services who have made it possible for me to become a success. Without them freedom and liberty would be gone.\u201d\n\nIn sum, we are rating this claim \u201cTrue\u201d because two individuals involved with the planning of the 1995 parade stated on two separate occasions that Trump\u2019s efforts and donation did indeed enable the event to take place. Still unclear are the origins of other sources of funding.", "lang": "en"}
