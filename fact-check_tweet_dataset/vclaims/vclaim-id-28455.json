Ralph Northam, a Democrat. The quote is made up.\n\n\"You will give up your guns, if you don\u2019t I\u2019ll have the National Guard cut your power, your phone lines, and your internet. Then, if you still refuse to comply I\u2019ll have you killed,\" the meme, posted Dec. 19, said above an image of Northam.\n\nThis post \u2014 the latest in a series of hoaxes targeting Northam over his support for a proposed assault weapons ban in Virginia \u2014 was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nLike another set of false posts about Northam, this one seems to trace back to a Dec. 13 blog post from Hal Turner, a white supremacist with a history of spreading conspiracy theories who was sentenced to 33 months in prison in 2010.\n\nBut we found no proof that Northam ever made such a statement. Northam\u2019s press secretary, Alena Yarmosky, told us in an email that the quote is \"absolutely false.\"\n\n\"People who spread lies like this should be ashamed of themselves,\" she said.\n\nDemocrats in Virginia are poised to take control of both the Senate and the House of Delegates in January, opening the door for the potential passage of proposed gun regulations such as Virginia Senate Bill 16, which would ban the possession, transport and sale of assault weapons.\n\nThe bill would expand the definition of \"assault weapon\" in the state and make possession of any such weapon a felony.\n\nBut there\u2019s no evidence that Northam would order the National Guard to cut off power, phone lines and internet or otherwise punish those who disobey any ban that takes effect.\n\nThe ban does not spell out how it would deal with firearms that Virginians already own, and Northam told reporters on Dec. 11 that the state is \"not going to take people\u2019s guns away.\"\n\nNortham has said he would call on law enforcement to enforce the bill, and he has also pushed back on resolutions that would make certain cities \"Second Amendment sanctuaries.\"\n\nWe rate the Facebook post Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
