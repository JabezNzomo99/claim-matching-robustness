The post claimed a sound engineer smuggled the recording out to release to the public should he need to \"save the country or himself.\"\n\nClinton didn\u2019t make these remarks, however, because this story is sourced to a post that originally ran Sept. 10 (when Irma swept across Florida) on the website AsAmericanAsApplePie.org.\n\nAsAmericanAsApplePie.org appears to be part of a series of fake websites associated with Christopher Blair, a self-described liberal troll who publishes fabricated stories in an attempt to trick conservative readers.\n\nWe\u2019ve fact-checked plenty of stories that originated from websites run by or affiliated with Blair, including TheLastLineOfDefense.org, FreedomCrossroad.us, OurLandOfTheFree.com and FreedomJunkshun.com.\n\nAsAmericanAsApplePie.org uses a website template similar to these other sites, and carries a disclaimer that reads, \"As American as Apple Pie is here to be your beacon of something you can kinda rely on sometimes but not really.\"\n\nClinton did not deride Florida on tape or suggest its residents should be blown away by a hurricane. We rate this statement Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
