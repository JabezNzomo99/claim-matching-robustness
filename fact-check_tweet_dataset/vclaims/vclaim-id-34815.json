Sonkar's image sparked a row and he was strongly criticised for such disrespectful behaviour.\n\nThe photo of Sonkar is being passed off a junior doctor in light of the recent strike by doctors of Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College, Kolkata. West Bengal's state run hospitals faced a shutdown after medical students went on a strike following an attack on NRS students over the death of a 75-year-old patient. The NRS called off their six-day long strike on June 17 after an interaction with chief minister Mamata Banerjee.\n\nThe viral image, captioned as, \u201cThis is (the condition of) junior doctor,\u201d (Bengali caption: \u098f\u0987 \u09b9\u09cb\u09b2 \u099c\u09c1\u09a8\u09bf\u09af\u09bc\u09b0 \u09a1\u09be\u0995\u09cd\u09a4\u09be\u09b0 ) had been shared more than 150 times at the time of writing this article.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be viewed here.\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search and found that the orginal photo is from 2016 when Sonkar's act was captured on camera. The same photo was widely circulated at that time.\n\nSonkar, a 2013 batch IAS officer, was on a routine visit to the Nutrition Rehabilitation Centre in Chattisgarh when he was photographed resting his foot on a patient's bed while talking to a patient. Netizens came down heavily on Sonkar, for his reported arrogant behaviour.\n\nThe IAS Association's official Twitter handle also tweeted their disappointment.\n\nThough Sonkar had later rendered an apology on Facebook, stating \u201cNo amount of words can justify the said act,although it was unintentional and was thoroughly avoidable,\u201d the apology is no longer available on Facebook. In fact, Sonkar\u2019s Facebook profile too has been deleted.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of an article about Sonkar's apology that he posted on Facebook.\n\nThe strike by NRS medical college doctors led to many fake posts doing the rounds on social media.
