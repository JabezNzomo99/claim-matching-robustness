Scott Walker unveiled his state budget, Twitter lit up with this claim:\n\n\"Scott Walker to cut $300 million from universities, spend $500 million on a pro basketball stadium.\"\n\nThe tweets were a copy-and-paste of a headline on by Think Progress, a liberal blog, that was posted the same day.\n\nIt was an eye-catching claim that went too far.\n\nThe first part of the claim in the tweets is on target.\n\nMore than a week before formally introducing his 2015-'17 budget, Walker that he would propose cutting $300 million over two years from the University of Wisconsin System.\n\nTop officials in , which includes the University of Wisconsin-Madison flagship and 25 other four-year and two-year schools, said the plan likely would lead to .\n\nIn exchange, the system would get more control over its budget and more freedom from state rules in its operations.\n\nWalker\u2019s proposed cut -- $150 million for each year of the biennium, for a total of $300 million -- amounts to a 13 percent reduction in state aid for the UW System. That reportedly would be the largest cut ever.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that state funding accounts for $1.2 billion of the system's total budget of $6 billion. Walker\u2019s cut in state aid would amount to 2.5 percent of the total budget.\n\nWe won't know until mid-2015 whether the cut ultimately becomes part of the final budget approved by the Legislature.\n\nBut there is no dispute that the $300 million reduction for universities is what Walker has proposed.\n\nMoney for a new basketball arena is more complicated.\n\nThe owners of the NBA\u2019s Milwaukee Bucks are trying to assemble private and public financing to build a new arena. The total cost is projected at about $500 million.\n\nThat is not the amount Walker is proposing to spend.\n\nLike the university cuts, Walker announced his arena proposal before making his official budget presentation. He offered in state bonding -- essentially a form of borrowing -- toward the cost of the arena. Debt payments on the bonds would be repaid from growth in the so-called \"jock tax\" -- income tax revenue from Milwaukee Bucks players, employees and visiting teams.\n\nThe rest of the $500 million would come from the Bucks\u2019 current owners, the team\u2019s former owner -- retired U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl -- and possibly from the City of Milwaukee and Milwaukee County.\n\nNormally, the growth in jock tax revenue would go to the state\u2019s general fund to help pay for things such as schools, roads and other public services.\n\nBut the Bucks could leave town in 2017 if a new arena is not in place by the fall of 2017. That is a deadline set by the NBA, which could buy the team back from its owners.\n\nIn other words, without a new Milwaukee arena, there might not be any jock tax revenue.\n\nSo, Walker is proposing a diversion of $220 million from the state's general fund to the arena.\n\nA slew of tweets claimed: \"Scott Walker to cut $300 million from universities, spend $500 million on a pro basketball stadium.\"\n\nWalker's 2015-'17 state budget does propose cutting $300 million from the University of Wisconsin System over the two-year period.\n\nThe governor also proposes, in the form of bonds, a state contribution for a new Milwaukee arena. But it wouldn't be $500 million -- the total cost of the arena -- but rather $220 million.\n\nFor a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.\n\nFor profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.\n\nTo comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s web page.", "lang": "en"}
