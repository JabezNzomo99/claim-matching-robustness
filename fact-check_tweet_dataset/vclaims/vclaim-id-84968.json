It is not unexpected with Gujarat being Prime Minister Modi\u2019s home state and his much touted Gujarat model of development. Alt News has analyzed the hashtags promoted by TV channels to build social media engagement. Although channels like NDTV, India Today and CNNNews18 selected neutral hashtags like #GujaratElection2017, #BattleForGujarat, #ElectionsWithNews18 and #AssemblyElections2017, others like RepublicTV and Times Now picked hashtags that were strongly opinionated. They used these hashtags to campaign and shape public opinion for or against the political parties in the fray. Read on to see the blatant partisan position taken in the attempt to influence popular opinion in favor of the ruling party.\n\nOther than an occasional neutral hashtag like #BattleForGujarat or #GujaratBattleground, the hashtags used by RepublicTV and Times Now betrayed a clear agenda. In a war for the louder and the more outrageous hashtag, any debate on issues affecting the common people took a backseat.\n\nHere are some of the common themes that emerged in the review of the hashtags:\n\nCongress remained a constant target of attack by hashtags of both RepublicTV and Times Now. Hashtags like #CongNeechPolitics accused it of playing politics whereas those like #CongSlamsIndiaRise and #CongTerrorPhoto attempted to portray it as anti-development and anti-national. After Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in an election rally in response to the Congress party that he had sold tea but not the nation, Times Now parroted the same with the hashtag #UPANeDeshBecha\n\nThe first tweet of RepublicTV on the hashtag #CongNeechPolitics asked the question whether Rahul Gandhi will act against Mani Shankar Aiyar for \u2018Neech remark\u2019. Rahul Gandhi\u2019s action however did not deter the channel from continuing to use the hashtag. What followed was over 150 tweets by Republic using this hashtag including a list of which Congress leader insulted Narendra Modi and when. The channel called it a \u201cdirect classist attack on PM Modi by a superannuated member of the Lutyens Circuit\u201d and announced that \u201cThe battle has now become between the rich elite and those they call \u2018Neech\u2019\u2019.\n\nNot to be left behind, Times Now called it #RahulNeechPolitics with an equal number of tweets\n\nTimes Now also focused on the \u201cself-goals\u201d of Congress. It was #CongChaiSelfgoal after the Youth Congress tweet and #RaGaSomnathSelfGoal, after Rahul Gandhi\u2019s visit to Somnath Temple. Disposal of Teesta Setalvad\u2019s plea for reasons known to Times Now became a #CongTeestaSelfgoal. Needless to say, when it came to BJP, there were no self-goals.\n\nThe hashtag #CongIgnoredPatel built on the popular right-wing narrative and accused Congress of ignoring Patel\n\nFinally when all else fails, bring in Robert Vadra. Republic TV followed this mantra on the last day before the second phase of the polls with #VadraEntersGujaratPolls. \u201cIn what capacity was Sonia Gandhi\u2019s son-in-law meeting Hardik Patel?\u201d Asked Republic TV in what it called an \u201cagenda setting newsbreak a day before Gujarat votes.\u201d\n\nRahul Gandhi\u2019s jibe on Gujarat model and ease of doing business ratings was reported by Republic TV with the hashtag #CongSlamsIndiaRise. One day after the elections were announced, Republic TV ran the hashtag #PakHawalaUnderCongress\n\nRahul Gandhi\u2019s remark saying PM Modi\u2019s Gujarat model has failed was debated on Times Now as #RahulVsIndiaRising\n\nThe unsubstantiated and unverified claim of PM Modi about Pakistan hand in Gujarat elections was reported by Republic TV with the hashtag #PakCongMeeting even after fact checks by multiple media outlets raised doubts about it.\n\nTimes Now was not far behind by digging out a 2013 photograph of Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram in the same room as Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Zaeef and presenting it as an exclusive newsbreak with the hashtag #CongTalibanTango. Read more about this desperate attempt by Times Now in thisAlt News story\n\nAny doubts about which party Times Now actively campaigned for can be laid to rest with a quick look at its hashtags mocking Rahul Gandhi. When Gujarat state Election Commission raised objection on the use of word \u2018Pappu\u2019 in advertisements, Times Now called it #PappuCensored and even carried a poll on it.\n\nWhen the poll panel cleared BJP\u2019s Gujarat advertisement with the word \u2018Yuvraj\u2019, Times Now reported it as #YuvrajReplacesPappu which soon turned into #PappuBanaYuvraj.\n\nA deliberate misinterpretation of Congress Leader Mani Shankar Aiyer\u2019s remark contrasting the Mughal rule to the democratic process of elections by Prime Minister Narendra Modi was played to the hilt by Republic TV with the hashtag #RahulMughalEmperor. Even after the lie was called out and the full video of Aiyar\u2019s statement surfaced, Republic TV continued with its hashtag and coverage. You can read more about this deliberate distortion here\n\nRahul Gandhi\u2019s press conference was presented by Republic TV as #RahulDucks. Arnab Goswami had some profound questions to ask \u201cWhy did Rahul Gandhi get up three times in midst of questions to end the briefing?\u201d and \u201cWhy was Ashok Gehlot passing notes to Rahul Gandhi while sitting to his right?\u201d\n\nRepublic TV tried every trick in the trade to run down the press conference and build public opinion against Rahul Gandhi. Here is a poll it ran on the topic.\n\nAttack leaders who have collaborated with Congress\n\nThe attack did not stop at Congress and its leaders. It extended to all those who opposed BJP. The so-called sex tape of Hardik Patel was a topic of incessant debate with hashtags like #HardikTapeTrouble #HardikTapes and #GujaratSexScandal.\n\nTimes Now labeled Hardik Patel, Alpesh Thakore and Jignesh Mevani as #TheCasteCowboys and also promoted the hashtag #RahulHardikTango\n\nA picture of Jignesh Mewani, receiving a cheque from members of SDPI, the political front of the PFI led to the hashtag #CongTerrorPhoto. \u201cRahul visits temple for votes, ally signs terror pact for notes\u201d, read the text on the screen along with the reference to \u201cHindu haters\u201d\n\nAs they say when all else fails, play the religion card. Both Republic TV and Times Now did just that at regular intervals.\n\nRepublic TV wanted to know #RahulHinduOrCatholic when the news broke about his name being entered in the non-Hindu register at the Somnath temple. Without a basic fact check, the channel went berserk in its reportage of the incident. You can read more about this bogus controversy here. In its ridiculous coverage, Republic TV aired Arnab Goswami\u2019s five questions to Rahul Gandhi over his religion.\n\nEven CNN News18 that usually shies away from using strong language unlike the other two jumped into the debate with #RaGaSignatureRow and the question \u201cWill India know if RaGa is a Hindu, Christian or an Atheist?\u201d\n\nRepublic TV accused Congress of playing the Muslim card with the hashtag #CongMandirLie.\n\nWhen the channels were not busy attacking the opposition, they were building the image of BJP and Prime Minister Modi. A fine example of this is the hashtag #GujaratGaaliPolitics that was promoted with posters claiming \u201cPM destroys #GujaratGaaliPolitics\u201d and \u201cPM corners Congress on Gaali Politics\u201d\n\nRebuttals of PM Modi to Congress had dedicated hashtags like #SoldChaiNotNation and #UPAnedeshbecha\n\nOn Oct 25th, the day election dates were announced, Times Now shared the results of its \u2018TimesNow \u2013 VMR\u2019 survey with the hashtag #GujaratModiVerdict. Using the hashtag #ModiSweepsGujarat, the channel asked \u201cIs Rahul still a liability for the party?\u201d and claimed to \u201cpredict accurately the results before the verdict\u201d\n\nInterestingly it was only one-sided slander during the Gujarat elections that was noticed by Times Now and PM Modi was portrayed as a victim with the hashtag #ModiMalignedIn2017. Any remark or attack by Congress had a dedicated hashtag like #CongChaiwalaAttack, #RahulNeechPolitics but attacks by BJP either went completely unnoticed or were actively supported.\n\nRepublic TV was the cheerleader for BJP\u2019s election campaign, tweeting with hashtags #BJPGujaratBlitzkrieg and #ModiMillionRally\n\nPM Modi\u2019s seaplane ride had dedicated hashtags like #ModiAirShow and #PMTakesOff and was touted as the \u201cfirst-ever seaplane in India\u201d. Though PM\u2019s own website has made the correction that it was not a first-ever in India, the Republic story is still online.\n\nRepublic TV went overboard in cheerleading calling it \u201chistoric\u201d and \u201cthe greatest political prop in India\u2019s history\u201d. Chitra Subramaniam, Advisor to Republic responded to criticism saying \u201cI think it\u2019s remarkable, PM taking off was very symbolic. But they will crib, because Narendra Modi\u2019s cardinal sin is that he was born \u2018poor\u2019\u201d. The choice of hashtag by Republic TV was interesting because at the same time the channel was running #PMTakesOff and #RahulDucks.\n\nAlong with building the image of PM Modi, he was also portrayed by both channels as a victim with hashtags like #ModiFaithAttacked and #RahulHateModiBrigade\n\nFocus on everything but development\n\nAt all times, attention was diverted from real issues facing the people and focused on matters like #GujaratTemplePolitics, #MuslimQuotaPlot, #RahulSeparatistBhakt, and #ModiAttacksRahulBhakt.\n\nWe also saw hashtags on #AnthemFirstNoCompromise, #BJPISISCharge, #ISISGujaratPlot, #ChurchVsNationalists and #RahulHinduTerrorCable.\n\nHere is a list of hashtags relating to Gujarat elections promoted by the two channels since Oct 25th:\n\nIs it too much to expect the fourth pillar of democracy to play a responsible role by debating the stand of political parties on critical issues that affect the people of Gujarat? There was not a single hashtag relating to economic issues or development. What we saw instead was sections of media taking a blatantly partisan position and using hashtags to manipulate public opinion in favor of one party. There was also a clear attempt to define the narrative of the election on communal issues in an attempt to distract the citizens from focusing on and questioning political parties over their position on issues of socio-economic significance.", "lang": "en"}
