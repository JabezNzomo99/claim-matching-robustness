That\u2019s gun control Founding Fathers\u2019 style.\"\n\nAfter unsuccessfully seeking Cruz\u2019s historical backup, we turned to a George Washington University historian, Kenneth Russell Bowling, who told us by phone he was fresh off contributing to the publication of 22 volumes of papers related to the earliest years of Congress.\n\nBowling said Cruz was likely reflecting on a measure passed into law by the nation\u2019s second Congress in 1792.\n\nTo get a fix on that, Bowling suggested that we consult record-keepers at the Library of Congress where, by email, a librarian who went unidentified pointed us to documentation of the Second Militia Act of 1792, approved by Congress on May 8, 1792 \u2014 six days after passage of the Militia Act of 1792 (which was repealed in 1795) giving the president authority to call out state militias to repel U.S. invasions and to do so in the case of state insurrections at the request of state officials or on approval of a federal district judge or an associate justice of the Supreme Court.\n\nThe second act required \"each and every free able-bodied white male citizen\" aged 18 through 44 to enroll in his state militia within the next year with the exception of the vice president, other federally elected officials and specified workers such as \"all ferrymen employed at any ferry on the post road\" as well as individuals exempted by state laws. Commanders were to continue enrolling eligible men in coming years, the law said.\n\nPer Cruz\u2019s claim, the law said every enrolled man \"shall within six months thereafter, provide himself with a good musket or firelock, a sufficient bayonet and belt, two spare flints and a knapsack, a pouch with a box therein to contain not less than twenty-four cartridges, suited to the bore of his musket or firelock, each cartridge to contain a proper quantity of powder and ball...\"\n\nSOURCE: Website, \"A Century of Lawmaking: for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875,\" Statutes at Large, 2nd Congress, 1st Session, Library of Congress (accessed May 16, 2017)\n\nCruz said: \"The first Congress passed a law mandating that every able-bodied man must own a musket.\"\n\nAction by the nation\u2019s second Congress wasn\u2019t that far-reaching. The law required states to create militias to be staffed by some able-bodied white men aged 18 through 44 who were to provide their own muskets and other supplies. Excused from militia service: Officials ranging from the vice president to certain workers and also anyone exempted by a state.\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
