She also claimed she had no idea what they were doing there or who they were working for.\n\n\"I don't even know who sent them there,\u201d Zakharova told reporters.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know whether they represented the media or a public organization there. I have no such information,\u201d she added.\n\nZakharova was answering a question from a reporter at a ministry briefing, about the journalists\u2019 investigation of a Russian private military company operating in the CAR. The spokeswoman pointed out the journalist had not followed appropriate procedures to report their activities. She would certainly have had access to such information about the employer and mission of the three journalists, since this was made public just hours after their deaths were first reported.\n\nThe three Russian journalists, Orkhan Jemal, Kirill Radchenko, and Alexander Rastorguev, were killed in the Central African Republican (CAR) when their vehicle was ambushed by unknown assailants near the town of Sibut\n\nIn a story posted on July 31, the website of the BBC\u2019s Russian service quoted Andrey Konyakhin, head of the Investigation Control Center, a project funded by Russian opposition figure Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Konyakhin said he and the three journalists were working together on a \u201cproject.\u201d The BBC story also reported that Maria Zakharova had been in contact with Orkhan Dzhemal\u2019s wife, but did not made clear whether she had informed Zakharova of her husband\u2019s activities.\n\nThe Russian news agency Interfax also published a story on June 31 which reported that the three journalists had arrived in the CAR on July 28 to work on a documentary film that was joint project with Khodorkovsky\u2019s Investigation Control Center (ICC). Interfax reported they were investigating the presence of Russian private military companies in the CAR.\n\nHowever, Zakharova had already demonstrated she had some awareness of what the journalists were doing and who sent them. On August 1, Polygraph.info published a fact check of her posting on Facebook earlier that day.\n\n\u201cI'm listening to and reading this nonsense about the \u2018investigation\u2019 of PMCs (Private Military Companies) in the CAR,\u201d the post read.\n\nKhodorkovsky himself made a statement about the murdered journalists and their investigation on his official website on July 31, pointing out they were investigating \u201cRussian private mercenaries, in particular the Wagner group.\u201d Zakharova, herself, showed familiarity with these facts in her August 1 Facebook post, in which she quoted Andrey Konyakhin and mentioned the ICC, and noted Mikhail Khodorkovsky\u2019s connection to the project. At the end of the post, she asked the ICC to name the local United Nations officials who allegedly told them where they could travel within the Central African Republic.\n\nIn the August 1 fact check of Zakharova\u2019s comments, Polygraph.info pointed out Zakharova made no mention of Wagner. Private military companies are illegal under Russian law and acting as a mercenary carries a criminal penalty in Russia.\n\nBased on those two Facebook posts from Maria Zakharova herself, it\u2019s clear that she is well aware of who the slain Russian journalists were working for and what they were investigating in the Central African Republic.", "lang": "en"}
