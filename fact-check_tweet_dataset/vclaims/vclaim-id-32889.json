This creates more space and in theory, this means when an area experiences heavy rainfall, there is greater capacity to accommodate it.\n\nThe European Commission has said more than once that EU law \u201cdoes not ban dredging\u201d, and the fact that it isn\u2019t banned can be seen from the fact that dredging is still carried out in the UK.\n\nHowever, some EU regulations can affect dredging decisions. For example, the EU Water Framework Directive affects elements of dredging such as evaluation as to whether dredging activities could affect wildlife. The Waste Framework Directive, meanwhile, has effects on how the silt is disposed of. A report from the dredging industry (written prior to the Water Framework Directive\u2019s implementation) suggested these considerations do have an impact, but that overall much depends on how individual EU member states implement the directives.\n\nBeyond this, it is far from clear that dredging would be a solution to much of the flooding seen in recent years.\n\nIn a blog post for the Environment Agency last week, the Director of Policy for the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management (CIWEM) said that dredging can help in some situations\u2014for example on the Somerset Levels (although more dredging would not have fully prevented the floods the Levels saw in 2013 and 2014).\n\nHowever, he said that for most areas where flooding has occurred, dredging would not be effective, as the floods come from fast-flowing rivers where sediment build-up is less of an issue.\n\nIn a 2014 report on the issue, CIWEM noted that dredging rivers can even increase the flood risk for communities downstream, by \u201cspeeding up the movement of floodwater through the river and drainage network\u201d. It can also cause greater erosion of river banks, which \u201ccan be a major hazard for infrastructure such as bridges\u201d.\n\nIt wrote that \u201cclaims that the widespread use of dredging can act as a flood prevention measure are not only unsupported by both science and evidence, they are a cruel offer of false hope to those living in flood-prone communities.\u201d\n\nOr, as Professor David Demeritt, a professor of geography at King\u2019s College London told Countryfile last week, \u201cThere has been an awful lot of garbage, if not factual untruths about dredging\u2026 it won\u2019t make any difference with really heavy rain. If you dredge, the water ends up in someone else\u2019s kitchen downstream, more quickly.\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s not true that EU law bans dredging, although it\u2019s fair to say that some EU rules can affect dredging decisions. And it\u2019s not true that dredging could have prevented much of the recent flooding\u2014potentially, in some cases, it could have made it worse.", "lang": "en"}
