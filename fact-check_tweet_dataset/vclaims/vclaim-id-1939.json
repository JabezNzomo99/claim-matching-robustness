No one has forced the Russian government to pursue someone else's foreign policy. Russian leaders and the Russian public have determined their own country's fate.\u201d\n\nKramer added: \u201cThe mere fact that Russia under Vladimir Putin has moved far back toward being an authoritarian state and has engaged in anti-Western posturing does not mean that its foreign policy is any more \u2018independent\u2019 than it was 25 years ago. Russian foreign policy was independent back then, and it is independent now.\u201d\n\nThe sanctions cited by Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry were first imposed in 2014, after Moscow annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe United States, in coordination with our G7 partners and the European Union, imposed sanctions against Russia in response to its violations of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity,\u201d a State Department spokesperson told VOA.\n\n\u201dSanctions will remain in place until Russia returns control of the Crimean peninsula to Ukraine and fully implements its commitments in the Minsk agreements,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nAlthough Russian officials and politicians claim Crimea has always been Russian and has simply been \u201creturned\u201d to Moscow\u2019s control, Vladimir Putin himself denied any legitimacy of Russia\u2019s claim over Crimea in a 2008 interview with German media.\n\n\u201cRussia's annexation of Crimea was illegal, pure and simple,\u201d said Harvard's Kramer. \u201cNeither the UN Charter nor any viable international legal structure confers a \u2018legal right\u2019 to undertake forceful annexation of territory. Quite the contrary. The whole international legal structure that has taken shape over the past 70 years explicitly prohibits seizure of territory by one country from another.\"\n\nMoscow rejects the use of the word \u201cannexation\u201d in reference to Crimea, claiming that the peninsula\u2019s separation from Ukraine was a choice the Crimean people made freely and expressed in a March 16, 2014 referendum.\n\nHowever, Crimea\u2019s indigenous Tatars reportedly refused to participate in the referendum, making its official results questionable.\n\nThe United Nations declared the results of the referendum had \u201cno validity\u201d and called on \u201call States, international organizations and specialized agencies not to recognize any alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea\u201d based on the March 16 referendum.\n\nThe annexation was the result of an operation that started with the appearance in Crimea of so-called \u201cpolite green men\u201d \u00ad\u2013 groups of armed men wearing khaki uniforms without insignia \u2013 who took control of all administrative buildings and media on the peninsula. Russia denied any link to the \u201cpolite green men,\u201d insisting that the events in Crimea were unfolding spontaneously, without Moscow\u2019s involvement. Later on, President Vladimir Putin admitted the men in uniforms without insignia were indeed Russian special troops.\n\nA new civilian administration was then installed in Crimea, which declared its independence from Ukraine and intention to join Russia. That was followed by the referendum, which sealed Crimea\u2019s separation from Kyiv and union with Russia.\n\nSuch was the chain of events that induced the United States, the European Union and more than 30 nations to impose sanctions on Russian government officials and institutions involved in Moscow\u2019s actions in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cRussia continues to occupy Crimea, following its attempted annexation,\u201d the U.S. State Department spokesperson told VOA. \u201cRussia also continues to foment and support a violent separatist movement in eastern Ukraine, including with the active support of Russian military forces, hardware, and training.\u201d\n\n\u201cSanctions are intended to press Russia to implement its commitments under the Minsk agreement,\u201d the spokesperson added. \u201cThey also represent the United States\u2019 commitment to holding accountable those who are responsible for the situation in Ukraine, including those who have committed and continue to commit violence against the sovereign nation of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nMark Kramer thinks the Russian government's \u201chighly selective espousal of self-determination\u201d might \u201ccome back to haunt it\u201d in Russia\u2019s North Caucasus.\n\n\u201cThe Russian authorities continue to promote their hypocritical endorsement of \u2018self-determination\u2019, but they might want to be careful about this,\u201d he said. \u201cRussia fought two bloody wars in the 1990s and 2000s to prevent Chechnya from becoming independent. Putin was willing to kill tens of thousands of Chechens for the sake of keeping the Russian Federation intact.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
