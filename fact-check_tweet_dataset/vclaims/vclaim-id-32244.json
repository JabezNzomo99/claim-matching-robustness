Screenshots of Goldman\u2019s LinkedIn profile show she worked as an Iowa organizer for Buttigieg\u2019s campaign until February, when she appears to have started her new voter protection director role with the party, according to Fox5.\n\nConcerns among voters quickly spread on social media, and some news outlets covered the Nevada Democratic Party\u2019s hiring decision. The website Blavity published a report Feb. 11 with the headline claiming, \u201cFormer Staffer For Pete Buttigieg\u2019s Campaign Is Now In Charge Of Voter Protection For Nevada Caucus.\u201d\n\nBut that headline is inaccurate. Spokespeople for both the Nevada Democratic Party and the Bernie Sanders campaign, as well as local media outlets, have stated Goldman will not lead voter protection efforts in Nevada\u2019s Democratic caucuses.

We\u2019ve spoken with the Nevada party, which has assured us that this individual does not have decision-making authority over the caucus count,\u201d Shakir tweeted. \u201cPls (sic) know we are working hard with the party to get every assurance that mistakes of Iowa are not repeated.\u201d\n\nNevada Democratic Party Communications Director Molly Forgey confirmed that the Feb. 22 voter protection team would be spearheaded by another individual on Twitter.\n\n\u201cNo staffer working at the Nevada Democratic State Party is affiliated with any campaign, and no one person has the ability to affect results,\u201d Forgey also said in a statement, according to Fox5. \u201cWe have many former campaign staffers and volunteers working to protect the integrity of this caucus, including people from Harris, Sanders and Warren\u2019s campaign \u2013 it is not unusual or uncommon for this to happen. Everyone working at NV Dems now has the same job: executing the most transparent, accessible, and expansive caucus yet.\u201d\n\nFox5 and the Las Vegas Review-Journal also both reported that Goldman\u2019s primary role will be assisting the party ahead of the general election in November.
