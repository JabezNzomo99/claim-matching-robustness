He was not honored for his \u201cwork within the black community.\u201d\n\nInstead, the Ellis Island Medal of Honor was given to Trump, who was a real estate developer at the time, for his contributions to the city of New York through his development projects, said Otto Coca, spokesman for the Ellis Island Honors Society. That\u2019s the group that gives the award.\n\nThe year Trump was honored was the first year the award was given, Coca said, and Trump was one of 86 people to receive a medal. Between 90 and 100 people are honored each year, Coca told us.\n\nThis year, the singer Paula Abdul and Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff were among the honorees.\n\nAccording to the Ellis Island Honors Society\u2019s website, the medals are given to those \u201cwhose accomplishments in their field and inspired service to our nation are cause for celebration.\u201d\n\nDespite the actual meaning behind the award, the fabricated claim that Trump was honored for his \u201cwork within the black community\u201d has been shared widely on Facebook and Twitter, where it appears to have originated on a pro-Trump account.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
