And I\u2019ll say, how are you doing? \u2018Oh, don\u2019t know, don\u2019t know, not well, Mr. President, not well.\u2019 I said, well, what\u2019s the problem? \u2018Oh, GDP 9 percent, not well.\u2019 And I\u2019m saying to myself, here we are at like 1 percent, dying, and they\u2019re at 9 percent and they\u2019re unhappy. So, you know, and these are like countries, you know, fairly large, like 300 million people.\u201d\n\nWhile this growth rate puts the United States on a par with developed nations like Canada and Britain, President Trump thinks the United States could be doing better. He believes the United States should be able to reach upwards of 4 or 5 percent growth, though most economists believe that is unrealistic on a sustainable basis. (The United States last topped 4 percent GDP growth in 2000.)\n\nTo help spur this boom in the U.S. economy, Trump is pressing to overhaul the U.S tax code by cutting tax rates and eliminating complex tax rules. When he talks about his tax plan, that\u2019s when the president enviously highlights the GDP growth of other countries. On several occasions, Trump anonymously quoted heads of state who he claims are unsatisfied with GDP growth of 7-to-9 percent \u2013more than five times the United States\u2019 2016 rate of 1.6 percent.\n\nOn July 25, Trump sat down with the Wall Street Journal\u2019s editor-in-chief Gerard Baker. During the interview, according to an unedited transcript obtained by Politico, Baker asked Trump what he thought was a reasonable corporate tax rate. Trump responded that he was \u201casking for 15 percent,\u201d before recounting an exchange about GDP growth he\u2019s had with several leaders of \u201cmajor \u2013 major countries.\u201d Trump claims that these unnamed heads of state lament GDP growth of 9 percent while the United States sees only \u201c1 percent\u201d growth each year.\n\nWe pored through the White House Press Office\u2019s log of the foreign leaders Trump has met with, or spoken to since taking office. Trump has spoken to 58 heads of state between Sept. 9 and Jan. 28, according to the White House records. Of these 58 countries only three had a 2016 GDP growth rate of roughly 7 percent or more: Iraq, India and the Philippines.\n\nIn 2016, the Philippines\u2019 GDP grew by 6.9 percent, India saw a 7.1 percent increase, and Iraq had the largest increase of 11 percent. When Trump sat down with the WSJ in July, he had already spoken with all three leaders. While all of the countries have a GDP growth rate well above the United States, none can claim a 9 percent increase. This fact leaves us scratching our heads, and wondering, who is the president quoting? At best, Trump is mis-remembering the conversations, and at worst, he is making up the facts. The White House did not respond to repeated requests for information.\n\nSeveral signs point to India\u2019s prime minister as that unhappy head of state. First, India\u2019s population is 1.3 billion, which qualifies the country as \u201cbig big.\u201d Second, Modi and Trump spoke last in August, and Trump described the call as recent. Third, Trump and Modi share a similar \u201cmy-country-first\u201d economic agenda. When Modi visited the White House on June 26, Trump praised Modi for making the largest tax cut in India\u2019s history.\n\nIndia\u2019s emerging economy explains why India\u2019s GDP percentage growth tops the United States\u2019 year after year. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a right-leaning policy organization, says it is much harder to make rapid economic gains in countries that have already experience a period of major investment. Instead, countries like the United States \u201care doing the hard work of keeping the economy churning along,\u201d said Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nSince meeting with Trump, Modi learned that India has hit an economic rough-patch. From April to June, India\u2019s growth slumped to 5.7, the lowest in three years, according to numbers released in September. Economists point to a decline in manufacturing growth, a sector Modi pledged to revitalize, as a key cause for the slump. Manufacturing growth bottomed out at 1.2 percent, from 10.7 percent during the same period a year ago.\n\nThat\u2019s one world leader. But the world leader who Trump claims is unhappy with 9 percent growth appears to be a phantom. Of the 58 heads of state he\u2019s met or spoke with since taking office, not one can claim 9 percent GDP growth. Perhaps Trump misheard. Or perhaps the other leader was fibbing. Or maybe Trump just thought the pitch for a tax cut sounded better if he could quote two leaders.", "lang": "en"}
