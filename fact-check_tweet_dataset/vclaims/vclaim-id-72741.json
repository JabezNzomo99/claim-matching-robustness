Those figures have appeared in doubt at times, including in January 2019 when news reports said the company was backing off or delaying its plans.\n\nAssembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, released a joint statement on the company\u2019s status Jan. 30, 2019. They covered a lot of territory, including some we\u2019ve already fact-checked.\n\nThey blamed new Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, for Foxconn\u2019s waffling \u2014 which we rated Pants on Fire.\n\nThey said \"not a dollar\" in state funds would go to Foxconn until jobs were created \u2014 which we rated Mostly True.\n\nAnd they addressed the impact Foxconn has already had in Wisconsin:\n\n\"In a short time, Foxconn has made a positive impact across Wisconsin with more than 1,000 new jobs, an investment of $200 million, three innovation centers and one of the largest gifts ever of $100 million to the UW-Madison,\" Vos and Fitzgerald said.\n\nHas Foxconn already been responsible for a four-figure bump in Wisconsin employment?\n\nWhen asked for backup to the claim, Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer pointed us to a Jan. 17, 2019 letter Foxconn sent to state officials detailing the employment impact to date.\n\nThe letter said Foxconn \"created 1,032 direct jobs and many more indirect jobs in support of the Wisconsin project. This figure includes 178 full-time Foxconn employees and 854 employees involved in the construction of (the Foxconn campus), who are residents of 54 counties in Wisconsin.\"\n\nSo Foxconn is connected to more than 1,000 jobs, but reaching that number requires combining the company\u2019s hiring with the temporary construction work generated by the building process.\n\nFoxconn said the 854 construction jobs tally is a cumulative one that counts every Wisconsin worker who has been involved in the project since it began. It\u2019s the most recent jobs report assembled by Gilbane Building Co., the project\u2019s general contractor, and includes work done through the end of November 2018.\n\nThere were also several dozen construction workers from outside Wisconsin.\n\nMost of those construction jobs no longer exist, though, since the phase of construction those workers were involved in has ended.\n\nJohn Mielke, president of the Associated Builders and Contractors of Wisconsin, said a project the size of Foxconn likely has several hundred workers on site at a time.\n\nBoth Mielke and Pat O\u2019Brien, executive director of the regional development group Milwaukee 7, said 854 construction jobs sounds reasonable for a project the size of Foxconn.\n\nVos and Fitzgerald said in a statement that Foxconn has already \"made a positive impact across Wisconsin with more than 1,000 new jobs.\"\n\nThat implies 1,000 people are now employed because of Foxconn, but that\u2019s not the case.\n\nNearly all of those jobs are temporary, construction-related positions. Experts say it\u2019s more likely several hundred construction workers were on the job at any given point thus far.\n\nThe discrepancy is particularly noteworthy since the number of Foxconn jobs is a key aspect of the political debate, and hiring at Foxconn itself fell short of the 260 jobs needed to qualify for a first round of state tax credits.\n\nThat makes it a statement with an element of truth that ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That\u2019s our definition of Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
