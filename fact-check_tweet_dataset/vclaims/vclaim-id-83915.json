The mob also forced him to chant religious slogans of \u2018Jai Shri Ram\u2019 and \u2018Jai Hanuman\u2019. Ansari died four days later in police custody on June 22.\n\nVideos of the assault have gone viral ever since with many seeing it as further evidence of increasing attacks on Muslims, women and those belonging to backward castes, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government.\n\nIn the same month there have been news reports of at least two other incidents of Muslims being assaulted and forced to chant \u2018Jai Shri Ram\u2019. Read more about it here and here.\n\nThese incidents have set in motion a parallel narrative on WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter where videos documenting blood curdling savagery have been shared in the past several weeks as evidence of Muslims perpetrating acts of violence against Hindus or vice versa.\n\nMany of the clips show mob violence and almost all have been shared with provocative captions that look to strike Hindu-Muslim fault lines.\n\nHe says watching graphic imagery causes anxiety apart from other symptoms.\n\nA desire to \"break\" news before mainstream outlets report it is a powerful motivator for some according to Dr. Shetty.\n\nOften gory videos from Latin America are passed of as India.\n\nA graphic video of a teenager hacked to death in Brazil was passed off as India\n\nA gruesome video showing a teenager hacked to death in Brazil was passed off as a man being lynched in India. Read more here.\n\nVideo show a man being murdered in the street in Bangladesh passed off as India\n\nSimilarly a video from Bangladesh showing assailants crush a man with a large stone was falsely shared as Muslims lynching a Hindu man. (Read more about it here)\n\nNot just Hindus and Muslims, disinformation about attacks on Dalits and women is also on the rise, undercutting an appropriate reaction to actual crimes committed against marginalised groups. (Read more about it here)\n\nIt also further erodes trust in the media. \n\n\n\nAn image of an injured ice cream seller from Uttar Pradesh's Unnao district was shared online with a false claim that a Hindu man was mistaken to be a Muslim and beaten up for not chanting 'Jai Shri Ram'. But a fact-check showed that the man was injured during an altercation with local goons and that there was no communal angle to it.\n\nEoghan Sweeney, an Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) and verification trainer based in Berlin, says an 'endless barrage of violence' can not only harm journalists but they also desensitise social media users.\n\nSweeney, who created OSINT Essentials to teach verification tools to journalists and online investigators, says recycled videos also can trigger a visceral reaction from a large group of people quickly.", "lang": "en"}
