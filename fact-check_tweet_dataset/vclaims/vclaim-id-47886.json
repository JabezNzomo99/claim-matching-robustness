And the health plan \u2014 pushed by Sen. Bernie Sanders and backed as well by Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 leaves many details yet to be colored in.\n\nWe were curious where these figures came from, and how they could be derived. So we decided to dig in.\n\nWe contacted the Biden campaign, which told us the figure was derived from approximating the impact of a 4% income tax, plus a 7.5% payroll tax \u2014 financing mechanisms they said have been proposed by Sanders.\n\nWhen you do the math, that suggests a family making $60,000 would indeed see the tax increase Biden surmised.\n\nBut this math is problematic on many levels.\n\nFor one thing, Sanders\u2019 bill doesn\u2019t actually propose financing Medicare for All through a combined 4% income tax and 7.5% payroll tax. The bill doesn\u2019t include any financing mechanism at all.\n\nIn a separate document, Sanders talks about different ways to pay for the system \u2014 and those are listed as two examples of pay-fors. But they aren\u2019t the only ones, and Sanders frames this list as \"a number of options to begin [the] discussion.\"\n\nSo suggesting that Medicare for All would increase taxes as specifically as Biden suggests is an inaccurate reflection of the bill.\n\nAnother issue is that there isn\u2019t a good sense of what this health plan would cost, so any estimate of its tax burden is really just a guess.\n\n\"There are so many unknowns that you cannot say anything definitive,\" said Gerard Anderson, a health policy professor at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nBiden\u2019s statement \"could be true,\" he added \u2014 but \"there\u2019s no evidence either way.\"\n\nAnd there\u2019s another issue, said Ellen Meara, a health economist at Dartmouth College. That is, highlighting the potential tax burden of Medicare for All without discussing overall costs is misleading, she argued.\n\nMeara pointed to research from the Kaiser Family Foundation, which found that the average employer-sponsored plan for a family of four costs $20,000 per in premiums. That, economists say, results in lower wages for employees. Many argue that if employers were relieved of this cost, that would translate into people earning significantly more in take-home pay.\n\n\"A $5,000 or $6,000 tax is really quite small compared with what middle-class families forego in cash wages to get employer-sponsored coverage,\" Meara said.\n\nBiden used an unusual level of specificity in describing how Medicare for all would affect families making between $50,000 and $75,000 per year.\n\nThose numbers don\u2019t come out of thin air, but they are based on too many assumptions to be reliable. And they don\u2019t accurately reflect what we know about what this plan would cost, or the extent to which it proposes specific new taxes.\n\nThis claim contains an element of truth, but it ignores critical facts and assumes more than the evidence warrants. We rate it Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
