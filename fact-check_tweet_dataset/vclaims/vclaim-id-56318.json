The posts claim it shows arms and ammunition taken from a member of parliament in Zamfara state, northwestern Nigeria. The claim is false; the photo was taken in 2013 when Nigerian troops displayed arms they said were seized from Islamist group Boko Haram.\n\nThe photo has been circulating on social media in Nigeria in recent days, including in this Facebook post from June 20, 2020. It has been viewed by nearly 500,000 people, according to data provided by the social network.\n\nThe post alleges that \u201csecurity operatives\u201d uncovered arms and ammunition during a raid at the home of a member of Zamfara\u2019s parliament in the capital Gusau and the lawmaker\u2019s constituency Tsafe.\n\nThe unnamed politician, described as a member of Nigeria\u2019s main opposition party, the People's Democratic Party (PDP), was described as undergoing interrogation for sponsoring attacks and kidnappings in northwestern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSome of the fire arms recovered and unearthed @ the Gusau \u00e1nd Tsafe residents of the nabbed ZAMFARA state house of assembly member , undergoing interrogation by the security operatives for sponsoring banditry , kidnapping in Zamfara ,Katsina , Sokoto And Kaduna, and recent Katsina protest (sic),\u201d the post reads. \u201cThe member represents PDP's party in the state.\u201d\n\nZamfara, Katsina, Sokoto, and Kaduna state, all in the northwestern region of Nigeria, have been wracked by years of violence involving clashes between rival communities over land, attacks by heavily-armed criminal gangs and reprisal killings by vigilante groups. This violence, which has claimed 8,000 lives and displaced 200,000 since 2011, has added to Nigeria\u2019s security challenges amid a decade-long attack of Islamist group Boko Haram in the northeast and farmer-herder clashes in central Nigeria.\n\nIn Zamfara state, security threats have combined with political tensions that came after Nigeria\u2019s supreme court sacked all elected political office holders under the country\u2019s ruling All Progressive Congress in the 2019 general poll, paving the way for candidates of the main opposition party, the People\u2019s Democratic Party.\n\nThe image was also shared on Twitter and Facebook alongside a similar claim.\n\nA Google reverse image search traced the image to a Voice of America story published in June 2013, which features the photo with a watermark for Associated Press (AP) news agency in the bottom right-hand corner. According to the agency, the photo shows arms and ammunition that \u201cmilitary commanders say was seized from Boko Haram radicals\u201d in Nigeria\u2019s troubled Borno state on June 5, 2013.\n\nAFP photographer Quentin Leboucher shot a similar image and filmed a short documentary of the scene on the same day.\n\nThe police have refuted the claim. \u201cThe story in its entirety is false,\u201d Police Public Relations Officer in Zamfara, Mohammed Shehu, said in a statement released on June 22, 2020.\n\nLocal journalists have also dismissed the rumours.\n\n\"The story is false in its entirety. It is a concoction as no politician or any other person was arrested in Zamfara in recent times over allegations of amassing weapons or association with bandits,\u201d Shehu Umar, a journalist covering Zamfara state for the Nigerian daily newspaper Daily Trust, told AFP Fact Check.\n\n\"I and my media colleagues have seen stories circulating on social media in recent days. It has no basis whatsoever.\"\n\nMeanwhile, using keyword searches from the post, AFP Fact Check traced the details about a raid on a Zamfara lawmaker to a story published by website Nigerian Bulletin more than six years ago, on June 4, 2014. It credits Nigerian daily newspaper The Guardian as the source of the information.\n\nWhile the Guardian story Nigerian Bulletin's report links to has since gone offline, AFP Fact Check found the article on page 70 of the June 4, 2014 edition of the newspaper.\n\nThe Guardian did not disclose the source of the story and neither version of the story gave the politician's name.", "lang": "en"}
