Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Indira Gandhi's father-in-law Yunus Khan, Indira Gandhi's husband Feroze Khan.\"\n\nWhile Jawaharlal Nehru is seen standing to Indira Gandhi's right, the other two men are to her left. The post says that the man to Indira Gandhi's left is Yunus Khan and the other man is Feroze Khan.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading.\n\nFacebook user \"Harish Rajpurohit\" had shared the photo along with the viral claim. The archived version of his post can be seen here. Many Facebook users such as \"Kumar Kamal Tumuluru\" and \"Aicc\" have shared the photo with the same claim.\n\nAFWA has found that the person standing to Gandhi's right is indeed Nehru. But the claim about the other two persons is wrong. The man to Gandhi's left is Russian artist, writer, philosopher and painter Nicholas Roerich and the one to his left is Mohammad Yunus Khan, a former diplomat and Gandhi's aide. We found the same picture on professional stock photo archive \"alamy.com\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThis photo was taken in 1942 at Roerich Estate in Kullu, Himachal Pradesh.\n\nIndira Gandhi's husband Feroze Gandhi is nowhere in the photo, as opposed to the claim. Her father-in-law was Faredoon Jehangir Ghandy, who again is not in the photo.\n\nRoerich is a revered Russian painter born in St. Petersburg, Russia, on October 9, 1874. According to the Nicholas Roerich Museum (NRM) in New York, he arrived in Mumbai in December 1923, and \"began a tour of cultural centers and historic sites\". After his expedition to India, his family established their home in Kullu.\n\nAccording to NRM, \"Here they established their home and the headquarters of the Urusvati Himalayan Research Institute\".\n\nYunus Khan was a diplomat and a very close aide to Indira Gandhi. He was in the Indian Foreign Service and a special envoy for the former PM.\n\nTherefore, after checking multiple sources, it is confirmed that the claim is misleading.", "lang": "en"}
