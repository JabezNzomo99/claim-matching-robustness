(How long will the blood of Hindus continue to flow didi? You and your politics have made a joke of Hindus in Bengal -translated)\u201d. Essentially, the message says that the video shows the suffering of Hindus in the Telinpara incident. The post has garnered more than 2,500 shares. At 40 seconds in the video, one can see a gory visual of a bloodied man.\n\n[The video has disturbing visuals. Alt News is not embedding it in the article.]\n\nTwitter handle @Saaho_sher posted the same video of the bloodied man and said, \u201cOnly Hindus are losing their blood in Bengal today.\u201d The tweet has garnered more than 2,400 retweets so far. Two more individuals \u2013 Divyans Pathak and Vishwpratap Kumar \u2013 tweeted the video with the same narrative.\n\nAlt News found a Facebook post by a Kolkata based social activist Md Zim Nawaz which said that the man in the video actually hails from the Muslim community. His name is Manzoor Alam, a 38-year-old year Jute mill worker based in Bhadreswar locality. Alam lives with his family at a place granted to him in the 12th line of Jute Mill quarters. He hails from Bihar.\n\nAlt News contacted Nawaz who then put us in touch with Alam. He said, \u201cI was sitting in my quarters with my family after opening Roza in the evening. A group of armed men came to my line, entered the spot [a ground near his house] where we were offering our namaz and started beating us up. First time when they tried to hit on my head with a sharp weapon like a knife, I put my hand in the way to stop them and got wounded. Then, I [eventually] got hit on the head. I am the person who is bleeding in the video. I was later taken to the hospital. I have multiple stitches in my hand and head.\u201d Watching the video on his phone and simultaneously speaking to us on the phone, Alam identified several people in the clip. He said, \u201cThe man in the red undervest is \u2018Insaaf\u2019, and there is one more boy named Bholu. Both are my neighbours. My younger son Parvez Akhtar can also be spotted in the video.\u201d In the image posted below, the person in the red garment is Insaaf.\n\nAlt News has accessed one more video of Manzoor Alam shot after the attack where his family tries to stop his wounds from bleeding, however, owing to the disturbing nature of the video, it has been withheld. In the image posted below, we have compared a frame from this video showing the profile face of Manzoor Alam with a recent image of him taken after he was discharged from the hospital.\n\nFurthermore, we spoke to the victim\u2019s son and asked him to shoot a testimony identifying the people while watching the video. Jawed Akhtar, the eldest son of Manzoor Alam, is in Delhi away from his family. In the video posted below, he identifies his father and his neighbours while running the viral on another mobile. After pausing the video played in the mobile at a point, he can be heard saying, \u201cThese are [my] friends who are standing here. One is Imran who standing behind and the one in a red t-shirt, his name is Insaaf.\u201d\n\nIn conclusion, BJP MP Arjun Singh shared a video of a bloodied man after communal clashes in West Bengal and suggested that the person attacked belonged to the Hindu community. However, as it turned out, the video showed a member of the Muslim community who was allegedly attacked by a mob from other community.", "lang": "en"}
