The following is one such post claiming his blood contaminated with HIV (AIDS) is added to Cadbury products.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be found here.\n\nClaim: Cadbury products are infected with blood contaminated with HIV (AIDS). Do not eat their products for the next few weeks. Fact: Similar hoaxes were doing rounds in social media for the past few years and the person in the picture was arrested for his involvement in Nyanya Motor Park explosion. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nA simple Google search on \u2018Cadbury Products HIV\u2019 will give a result to already fact checked articles on this by Snopes and Politifact. To understand the origin of the picture, just crop the picture and perform a reverse image search. The results show that a similar hoax was doing rounds with a different context and was debunked by Snopes in 2011. To filter out recent results, just add a time filter to show only results till 2014 and you notice few results that indicate the person arrested in the picture is Aminu Ogwuche, for his alleged involvement in Nyanya Motor Park explosion.\n\nFinally, the claim that Cadbury products are infected with blood contaminated with HIV (AIDS) is False. It is also important in this context to understand that as per Centers for Disease Control, \u201cYou can\u2019t get HIV from consuming food handled by someone with HIV. Even if the food contained small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen, exposure to the air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid would destroy the virus. Though it is very rare, HIV can be spread by eating food that has been pre-chewed by someone with HIV. The contamination occurs when infected blood from a caregiver\u2019s mouth mixes with food while chewing. The only known cases are among infants.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
