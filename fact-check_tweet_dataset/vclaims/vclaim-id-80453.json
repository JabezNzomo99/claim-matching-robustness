The BJP and the Congress party were left embarassed when its social media heads were caught red-handed tweeting the dates, part of which were also wrong.\n\nWhile they got the polling date correct, they got the counting date wrong.\n\nBut as journalists started questioning Malviya on where he got his information from, the BJP's IT cell head put out a clarification.\n\nTimes Now had put out the dates at 11:06 am attributing to sources. Strangely, ignoring their own error, the channel chose to question Amit Malviya based on a tweet that showed he had tweeted the poll dates information at 10:38 pm on Monday evening. The channel said that it wants to question Malviya on why was he blaming them for a tweet that he had published over 12 hours back.\n\nBOOM spoke to Times Now's Anand Narasimhan who accepted that the channel did put out the info at 11:06 am based on sources. Narasimhan said that they are still waiting for a clarfication on how the timestamp on Malviya's tweet showed 10:38 pm.\n\nThe screenshot carrying the 10:38 pm time was put out by a journalist Ankit Tyagi of Aaj Tak. While Times Now failed to explain the timing mystery, it was very obvious that the device that took the screenshot of the tweet was either based in a different time zone or set to a different time zone. We checked the US West coast time and found that 11:08 am IST is equivalent to 10:38 pm\n\nEither ways, it is highly unlikely that Amit Malviya's tweet a day before would go unnoticed by journalists and rival politicans till the time the controversy broke out. Here are some tweets from prominent Twitteratis who had taken the screenshot of Malviya's tweet when he put it out at 11:08 am. Amit Malviya has over 1.5 lakh followers on Twitter.\n\nIncidentally, Congress' Karnataka social media head Srivatsa also had to hurriedly clarify that he got the dates from news channels.\n\nAmit Malviya and Srivatsa were not the first ones to put out the poll dates. Apart from Times Now who put out the source-based information at 11:06, several news channels had carried the information on their channel much before the EC announced it around 11:22 am.\n\nMeanwhile, BJP's Malviya wrote a letter to the Election Commission clarifying that he had tweeted the information after seeing it on Times Now. Ironically, Malviya also pointed out Srivatsa's tweet in a bid to show that he was not alone to follow the reporting of news channels.", "lang": "en"}
