It\u2019s also not showing Los Angeles.\n\nIt\u2019s from 2015 and depicts a shantytown in Paris, located along a disused railway line.\n\nA reverse-image search of the photo led to a December 2015 Daily Mail story that discusses the large Roma community in Paris, often referred to as Roma gypsies, who have built hundreds of shacks using wooden boards and scrap material along an old railway line.\n\nThe Petite Ceinture is a 19-mile belt that has been derelict for several decades, the Guardian reported in 2016, and its redevelopment has long sparked debates in the country.\n\nShortly after the migrant crisis hit Europe in 2015, the camp took root.\n\nAround the time the photo was taken, the camp, which has no electricity or running water, spanned about 500 meters and was home to approximately 350 people.", "lang": "en"}
