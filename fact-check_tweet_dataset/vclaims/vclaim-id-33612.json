The post is however from a bogus page and a DBE spokesman slammed the claim as 'fake news'.\n\nThe Facebook post, which we\u2019ve archived here, says, 'Due to high rate of teenage pregnancy, condoms will be part of stationery in 2020'.\n\nMore posts surfaced days later on another fake Facebook account here, shared more than 300 times. South African tabloid The Daily Sun also published an article on November 5, debunking the Facebook post, adding some of the reactions it provoked from social media users.\n\nHowever, a cropped image of the newspaper version of The Daily Sun\u2019s article was taken out of context and shared online. These misleading posts have been shared thousands of times here and here.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Basic Education (DBE) condemned the post as \u2018fake news\u2019, expressing his frustration that \u2018we need to spend time distancing ourselves from the fake news\u2019.\n\n\u201cFake NEWS!! It keeps happening and some people fall for these images. Be careful because it will make you angry for no reason because it is just trash,\u201d said DBE spokesman Elijah Mhlanga.\n\n\u201cPeople have time to manufacture nonsense that creates panic, anger and shock. We should also stop spreading it because we give them joy when it receives so much attention. WhatsApp groups are full of these things.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s annoying that we need to spend time distancing ourselves from the fake news,\u201d Mhlanga added in his Facebook post, along with two pieces of misleading content.\n\nA search on Facebook shows multiple accounts for the department, for example here, here and here. However, poor spelling and humorous content suggests many of them are fake.\n\nThe real accounts to follow are DBE SA on Facebook, which links back to the official website and DBE_SA on Twitter, a verified account.\n\nThe DBE policy on HIV, STIs and TB approved in 2017 allows pupils aged 12 and older access to male and female condoms, as well as information on how to use them -- see local news here.\n\nLast week, the South African education department launched a campaign aimed at 'streamlining efforts by governments across the regions to reduce the alarming rates of early and unintended pregnancies among adolescents and young people'.", "lang": "en"}
