Khan\u2019s exact words were,\u201cHum do nuclear armed mulk hai. Agar ye aage tensions badhti hai toh duniya ko khatra ha isse. Humari taraf se kabhi koi kisi taraf pehel nahi hogi\u201d (We are two nuclear-armed nations. If these tensions escalate, the world could be in danger. There won't be a first from our side.) All Khan said was that Pakistan would not be the aggressor amid the current tensions between the two nations.\n\nHours after Khan vowed that Pakistan will not initiate a war with India, Mohammad Faisal, spokesperson of Pakistan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, clarified that Khan\u2019s statement was \u201ctaken out of context\u201d and that \u201cthere is no change in Pakistan\u2019s nuclear policy.\u201d\n\nSince conducting its second nuclear tests, Pokhran-II, in 1998, India has a 'no first use' policy, which means it has pledged to not strike first. However, it retained the right to retaliate in response to a strike. Meanwhile, Pakistan has not stated a 'no first use' policy. Its nuclear policy is India-centric, as it is driven by threat to its security from India. The country retains the option of using nuclear weapons first in the event of a war.\n\nKhan\u2019s comments come at a time when he has been repeatedly threatening the possibility of a nuclear war with India over Kashmir, after his efforts to internationalise the matter failed to gain any traction. In August, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had hinted at a major shift in India\u2019s nuclear weapons doctrine by suggesting that its 'no first use policy' would depend \u2018on future circumstances\u2019.", "lang": "en"}
