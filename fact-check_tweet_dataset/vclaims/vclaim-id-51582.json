Cities will only burn when black criminals are killed while breaking the law.\n\nThis is how that post appears on social media:\n\nA third post said, \"the national media has said nothing. Seriously, nothing.\" A fourth post read: \"Not even a whisper on the mainstream media. His life mattered as much as anyone else's. Since the media refuses to acknowledge him, let's make sure we do.\" And a fifth post mentioning a lack outrage and coverage said:\n\nWe give George Floyd 4 televised funerals, a folded American flag,over 70 days of rioting and millions upon millions of dollars donated to his family. Hollywood held massive protests for George Floyd. What does this child get? WHAT DOES THIS CHILD GET?!??! THIS is why people are FED up. People are arguing that no masks constitutes murder. THIS WAS MURDER. Cannon Hinnant, a 5 year old boy shot point blank in the face and killed in front of his siblings. No media coverage. No outrage. His life MATTERED #SayHisName #AllmeansAll\n\nThe truth is that the media, and not just local news, has widely covered this tragedy.
