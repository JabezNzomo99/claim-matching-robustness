She said she got a call from her friend the day after the alleged attack, detailing exactly how Trump pushed Stoynoff against a wall.\n\nLiz McNeil, at the time a reporter for People (she is now an editor). She said that she heard about the incident the day after Stoynoff returned from her assignment. \u201cShe was very upset and told me how he shoved her against a wall,\u201d she said.\n\nMary Green, another People reporter (now editor) who had just returned to New York. \u201cIn an early conversation we had in her office, she told me about what happened with Donald Trump,\u201d Green said. \u201cShe was shaky, sitting at her desk, relaying that, \u2018He took me to this other room, and when we stepped inside, he pushed me against a wall and stuck his tongue down my throat.
