But they are not right all the time.\n\nMadhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is the latest victim. Chouhan has been criticised by some netizens for \"secretly feasting on non-vegetarian food while publicly claiming to be a staunch Hindu\".\n\nThese comments are made on the basis of a picture in which Chouhan can be seen having a non-vegetarian meal inside a helicopter.\n\nThe picture was shared by Facebook user Ashraf Devgan in a group, 'I support ravish kumar i support truth...'. This public group has more than 80,000 members.\n\nIndia Today Fact Check team found the photo to be morphed. In the original photo, Chouhan can be seen eating something that does not look like non-vegetarian food.\n\nWhen we searched on the Internet using keywords, \"Shivraj chopper food\", we found an article dated November 17, 2018 published on Tribune website.\n\nThe photo caption in the article reads: \"Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh takes a break for meal inside a chopper during his election for the assembly polls on Saturday.\" The photo was attributed to Press Trust of India (PTI). We found the original image on the PTI website with the same caption.\n\nAlso, in the original photo, a spoon can be seen on the plate. Whereas, in the viral image, which has been badly doctored, a portion of the spoon is still visible.\n\nWe also spoke to SK Mishra, principal secretary to the Madhya Pradesh CM, to check if Chouhan is a vegetarian. He told India Today, \"Not only is he a pure vegetarian, he even avoids eating at a place where non- vegetarian meal is served.\"\n\nAlso read | Fact Check: Did Rahul Gandhi goof-up on paddy price during Chhattisgarh rally?\n\nAlso read | Fact Check: No, Rahul Gandhi didn\u2019t say he will make Sun rise from the West", "lang": "en"}
