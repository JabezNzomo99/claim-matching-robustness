(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nMichael Frazier, a spokesperson for the 9/11 Memorial & Museum, told PolitiFact on June 8 that the Facebook post is wrong. \"It is not true,\" he said.\n\nIn February, a 9/11 memorial in Plymouth, Mass., was damaged a week after Plymouth Rock was vandalized with red graffiti, CNN reported at the time.\n\nBut we found no news coverage of such vandalism at the 9/11 Memorial in New York City. And there remained no coverage when we looked at this again on June 24, 2020, as versions of the post were being reshared.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first incorrect claim about vandalism during protests that we\u2019ve checked. For the record: The Lincoln Memorial wasn\u2019t covered in graffiti, President Donald Trump\u2019s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame wasn\u2019t destroyed, this Vietnam memorial wasn\u2019t defaced by Black Lives Matters demonstrators, and these war memorials weren\u2019t either.", "lang": "en"}
