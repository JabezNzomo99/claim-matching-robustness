It reads:\n\nUsers on social media saw this:\n\nPeople wanting to inquire about United Way's COVID-19 Community Economic Response and Recovery Fund should call the agency's non-emergency line at *211, which connects the caller to their local group, United Way's director of public relations, Southerlyn Reisig, told Lead Stories.\n\nThe relief organization is asking people not to call the number listed on the meme as it is connects callers only to resource specialists in central Indiana, who have been overwhelmed by telephone calls, Reisig said, adding:\n\nFinancial assistance is not available to all individuals through that local Indiana number, nor 211 everywhere.
