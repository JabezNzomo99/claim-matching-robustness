But the products are usually considered inappropriate for seniors because they tie up needed income.\n\n\n\nThe Herald noted that annuities scams involving seniors have been a growing problem in Florida. And that the Department of Financial Services launched 267 senior annuity investigations in the fiscal year ending June 30.\n\n\n\nKevin Cate, Sink's press secretary at the Florida Department of Financial Services, provided us with links to the Florida statutes that illustrate the CFO's authority on the topic. The law also notes the rights of victims not to be identified. He faxed us the 2008 and 2009 settlement agreements that resolved four citizens' complaints against the Allianz insurance company, which Krakow purportedly represented, brought by the Florida Department of Insurance Division of Legal Services. Each had the seniors' identities redacted, but a summary page showed the range in reimbursements. The smallest was $19,319.27, while the largest was for one investor with nine annuities valued at $932,837.09.\n\n\n\nHis summary page also noted that, with subsequent settlements, the figure was more than $1.5 million, which was slightly higher than Sink had said.\n\nSink\u2019s office handled the case through its Division of Insurance Fraud, which is part of the Department of Financial Services.\n\n\n\nReached by telephone, Passinissi confirmed the refund. She said her share of it was $270,000. A former owner of a private employment agency, Passinissi, 74, said she tried to get her money out of the annuity in 2008 by contacting the insurance firm itself -- to no avail. She mentioned her plight to a banker she knew, who sent her to Sink. Passinissi said she called and then wrote Sink directly -- and enclosed documents to illustrate the problem.\n\n\n\nPassinissi is happy to see Sink take credit.\n\n\n\n\"She wrote to me way, way back and I remember I was very impressed. She said, 'Don\u2019t worry we\u2019ll get to the bottom of it.' After that she sent a person to get a deposition from me, to get the facts,\" Passinissi said.\n\n\n\nAs CFO, Sink oversees the Department of Financial Services, which investigated the complaints and arranged for people such as Passinissi to recoup their money. Sink's claim actually understates the amount that was recouped (she said $1.2 million when it ultimately totaled $1.5 million), but we find she can rightly claim credit for the department's work.\n\n\n\nSo we rate Sink\u2019s claim to be True.", "lang": "en"}
