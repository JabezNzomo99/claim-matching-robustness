In the tweet, Trump appeared to criticize President Barack Obama\u2019s handling of a 2009 pandemic and stated that he would \u201cnever let thousands of Americans die from a pandemic while in office\u201d:\n\nObama\u2019s handling of this whole pandemic has been terrible! As President, ALL responsibility becomes yours during a crisis like this, whether or not you\u2019re entirely to blame. John McCain, and for that matter myself, would never let thousands of Americans die from a pandemic while in office.\n\nThis is not a genuine tweet from Trump in November 2009, some seven years before he became president. The tweet does not appear on Trump\u2019s timeline, nor is it included in the Trump Twitter Archive or Fact Base\u2019s archive of deleted tweets. In fact, we weren\u2019t able to find any record of this message prior to April 2020, indicating that this is a modern creation with a falsified date.\n\nFurthermore, the text of this tweet contains nearly 300 characters. But at the time it was supposedly sent, back in November 2009, Twitter had a limit of 140 characters per tweet.\n\nWhile the above-displayed tweet is fake, Trump has made similar comments on Twitter. In November 2013, he tweeted that leaders were always responsible no matter what happens:\n\nIn contrast, Trump said in March 2020 that, \u201cI don\u2019t take responsibility at all\u201d when asked about the lack of testing in the United States for COVID-19.\n\nTrump has also criticized Obama\u2019s handling of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. On April 17, 2020, Trump tweeted:\n\nWhile the \u201cBiden/Obama\u201d tweet above is real, it contains many falsehoods.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 12,469 people died in the United States from the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, not 17,000. Obama\u2019s approval rating also wasn\u2019t \u201cdisastrous.\u201d A poll conducted by the Washington Post and ABC News over the course of several months in 2009 showed that Obama\u2019s approval rating for his handling of the H1N1 pandemic ranged from the high 60s to the high 50s. Also, the \u201cObamacare\u201d website cost much less than $5 billion.", "lang": "en"}
