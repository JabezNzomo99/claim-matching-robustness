Josh Hawley claimed that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has not spoken against violence and looting that has occurred at protests the past few months.\n\n\u201cAre we going to see Joe Biden in the next couple of days, after three months of encouraging this violence, tell us that he\u2019s against it?\u201d Carlson asked Hawley.\n\n\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d Hawley responded. \u201cAnd the reason is Tucker, the Marxist left\u2014and let\u2019s just call them what it is\u2014the Marxist left is essentially in control now of the Democratic Party. \u2026 And Joe Biden is absolutely enthralled to them. So this is why he can\u2019t come out and condemn what we\u2019re seeing right in front of our own eyes, which is the assault on law-abiding Americans.\u201d\n\nHawley later repeated his claims in a tweet:\n\nIn fact, Biden has condemned violent protesters in Kenosha and elsewhere. In a video released on Twitter Wednesday afternoon\u2014before Hawley\u2019s appearance on Carlson\u2019s show\u2014Biden said: \u201cBurning down communities is not protest, it\u2019s needless violence\u2014violence that endangers lives, violence that guts businesses, and shutters businesses that serve the community. That\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nThe day before, Biden campaign spokeswoman Symone Sanders issued a statement decrying the \u201cburning down communities and needless destruction\u201d taking place in Kenosha.\n\nBiden\u2019s condemnation was a beat-for-beat repetition of his denunciation of violence and looting after the death of George Floyd, when he wrote: \u201cProtesting such brutality is right and necessary. It\u2019s an utterly American response. But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not. Violence that guts and shutters businesses that serve the community is not.\u201d\n\nAs evidenced by Biden\u2019s statements, Hawley\u2019s claims that the Democratic nominee has remained silent on protests that turn violent are false.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
