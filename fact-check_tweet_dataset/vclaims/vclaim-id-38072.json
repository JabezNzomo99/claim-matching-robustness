But \u00a31 billion is a reasonable figure to use, based on the data we've seen.\n\nLocal spending on youth services has fallen since 2010\n\nWhen it comes to local councils\u2019 spending on youth services, it\u2019s possible to look at the total budget for children and young people, or for \u201cservices for young people\u201d specifically, which is a part of the wider budget. The first of these covers everything from Sure Start centres and youth clubs, to fostering and family services, while the second focuses on \u201ceducational and recreational leisure-time activities\u201d like youth clubs, sports or arts activities for young people.\n\nLabour hasn\u2019t been consistent on which measure it uses: in the past it\u2019s looked at the total budget for children and young people (also finding a \u00a31 billion reduction since 2012), and this time it\u2019s just looking at the subset on young people\u2019s services.\n\nBetween 2010/11 and 2019/20, spending on the total children and young people\u2019s budget is set to have fallen by about \u00a31.4 billion, taking inflation into account, or by 13%. It was the equivalent of \u00a310.8 billion in 2010/11 and has an expected spend of \u00a39.4 billion this year.\n\nMeanwhile, over the same period spending on services for young people is set to have fallen by about \u00a31 billion with inflation, or by 73%, from the equivalent of \u00a31.4 billion in 2010/11 to \u00a3375 million planned for this year. These figures don\u2019t include relatively small income generated by councils to offset this, but the scale of spending reductions is similar either way.\n\nThe reason the two measures show such a different scale of reduced funding is because, within the total budget for children and young people, spending reductions have fallen mostly on the youth services element, and in particular funding for Sure Start children\u2019s centres. Spending on looked after children, by contrast, has gone up since 2010, according to the National Audit Office.", "lang": "en"}
