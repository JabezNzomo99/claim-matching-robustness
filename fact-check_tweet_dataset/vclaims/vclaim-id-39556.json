According to this article, India\u2019s GHI ranking fell from 55 to 103 from 2014 to 2018. This is incorrect and was fact-checked by Alt News in an earlier article.\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s fact-check was progressing rather smoothly until they compared the 2008 and 2018 GHI scores and claimed that the country has witnessed an improvement. The video said that India\u2019s 2008 score was 35.6 and in 2018, this number stood at 31.1. BJP implied that the country\u2019s index score has improved by 4.5 points (a lower GHI score implies better performance) in the last 10 years.\n\nHowever, the party got it wrong.\n\nGHI data cannot be compared with previous years\u2019 reports\n\nBJP picked up the 35.6 value from GHI 2017 report and compared it with India\u2019s 2018 GHI index score, which is 31.1. However, the 2018 report clearly mentions that GHI scores are comparable within each year\u2019s report, but not between different years\u2019 reports because every year the scores are revised.\n\nThe 2018 report also states that \u201ceach report includes GHI scores and indicator data for three reference years in addition to the focus year. In this report, 2018 GHI scores can be directly compared with the GHI scores given for three reference years\u20142000, 2005, and 2010.\u201d\n\nContrastingly, the 2017 report included the reference years 1992, 2000 and 2008.\n\nThe revised 2008 data in the 2017 report was 35.6 and BJP compared this score with the current year\u2019s score (31.1) to show an improvement.\n\nGHI ranks/scores are based on a plethora of factors and comparison of previous years\u2019 reports does not arrive at an accurate conclusion. This is because a country\u2019s deteriorated ranking does not necessarily imply a fall in its index score, and vice-versa. For instance, India\u2019s GHI score in 2017 was 31.4 and its current score is 31.1. Even with the 0.3 point improvement, India\u2019s rank came down three places. This can be attributed to various factors, including a better performance by other countries.\n\nHowever, as GHI clarifies, previous years\u2019 index scores are comparable within the same report. BJP could have only referred to the 2018 report and compared the revised index scores of 2000, 2005 or 2010 and compared it with the current year\u2019s score (31.1) to show an improvement. Instead, the party picked up data from an entirely different report.\n\nAnother misleading information provided by BJP\u2019s in its fact-check video was terming India\u2019s current Global Hunger Index score of 31.1 as \u201cnot alarming\u201d. All countries with a score above 34.9 have an \u201calarming\u201d level of hunger but this does not imply that scores below 34.9 are \u201cnot alarming\u201d. India\u2019s 2018 GHI score is at the \u201chigh end of the serious category\u201d. The GHI 2018 report categorises index scores 20.0 to 34.9 as \u201cserious\u201d levels of hunger.\n\nWhile attempting to \u2018fact-check\u2019 Congress President Rahul Gandhi, the Bharatiya Janata Party itself made factual errors.", "lang": "en"}
