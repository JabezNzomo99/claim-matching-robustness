The claim is false; the Excise Department told AFP the claim was \u201cfalse\u201d; the director of Thailand's Tax Planning Bureau said sanitary pads were subject to seven percent VAT and that taxation for sanitary pads would not be increased.\n\nThis misleading post was published on Facebook on December 16, 2019. It has been shared more than 30,000 times.\n\nThe post\u2019s lengthy Thai-language caption translates to English in part as: \u201cThe Prime Minister is not regulating the price of sanitary pads, having classified them as luxury items, and imposed high taxes. How much does this affect women?\u201d\n\nText superimposed on the photo translates to English as: \u201cPM categorised sanitary pad as a 'luxury item', collecting 40% tax.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nA similar claim was also published here on Facebook by Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a Thai scholar who describes himself on Facebook as an associate professor at Kyoto University's Centre for Southeast Asian Studies.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of his misleading post:\n\nThe post translates to English as: \u201cThe government\u2019s decision to announce sanitary pads as luxury items is actually a clever strategy to encourage coconut farming on the sidelines. Women will have to switch from using sanitary pads to coconut meal. What a fascinating policy! Very feminist.\u201d\n\nIn the past, Thai women used part of the coconut as a sanitary product, according to this report in the Bangkok Post.\n\nOther posts with a similar claim were shared widely on Facebook and Twitter, for example here, here, here and here.\n\nOn the same day that the misleading posts were published, Kedpriya Kaewsaengmeung, spokesperson for Thailand\u2019s opposition Pheu Chat Party, claimed the Prime Minister had imposed a luxury tax of up to 40 percent on sanitary towels, according to this report by Thai broadcaster PBS.\n\nThe claim is false; the Thai government released an official statement on December 16, 2019, stating the claim circulating on social media was untrue.\n\nBelow is the screenshot of the Thai government\u2019s release:\n\nThe report translates to English in part: \u201cClarification, No Excise Tax on Sanitary Pads.\n\n\u201cRegarding the news report that claims the government has implemented a tax hike on sanitary pads, causing the products to become more expensive, the Excise Department would like to clarify that there is no excise tax imposed on sanitary pads in any way.\n\n\u201cSanitary pads are not a product in the excise duty rate, because it is not considered to be a luxury item. Currently, only VAT is charged\u201d.\n\nUnder the current tax scheme, sanitary pads are filed under the \u201ccontrol goods\u201d category, among other 45 regulated products, including medicines, rice, and washing detergent. Here is a list of regulated products published by Thailand\u2019s Government Gazette on July 4, 2019.\n\nPart of the statement translates to English as: \u201c\u2018Control goods\u2019 are products that fluctuate in value depending on the economy. Hence; there is a need for price control in order to prevent unfair trade practices.\u201d\n\nThai government spokeswoman Narumon Pinyosinwat tweeted on December 16, 2019 that the 40 percent tax claim was incorrect.\n\n\"Confirmed, the Excise Depart does not tax sanitary pads as a luxury product up to 40% because it is a basic need for women. Sanitary pads are not categorised in the excise duty rate, only VAT is charged just like any other product,\" the tweet said.\n\nNutthakorn Utensute, Director of the Tax Planning Bureau for Thailand\u2019s Excise Department told AFP by phone on December 18, 2019: \u201cControlled goods are essential products for a person\u2019s basic needs and they are regulated by the Department of Internal Trade.\n\n\u201cSanitary pads are classified under this category as it is an essential item for women.\n\n\u201cLuxury goods such as soft drinks and perfumes, are products that are non-essential to a person\u2019s basic needs.\n\n\u201cThere is no way sanitary pads can be considered as luxury goods, and I don\u2019t see any possibility in which an additional tax would be imposed on sanitary pads.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
