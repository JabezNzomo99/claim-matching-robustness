A group of Chandrayaan-2 scientists performed puja before the launch. In addition, before any launch by ISRO, a replica is presented to Lord Venkateswara in Venkateswara temple so that the launch is successful. Not only in India, but religious rituals are performed around the world. Now a fool will say that the scientist does not believe in worship, why? Congratulations ISRO\"\n\nWe searched with the same caption and found that the post was viral on Facebook.\n\nA reverse image search showed that the viral image was taken before the test launch of the Agni-V and not Chandrayaan 2.\n\nBOOM found the image on wire agency Getty Images dated September 15, 2013, the same date as the second test launch of Agni-V. Read here.\n\nThe picture clicked by Pallava Bagla had the caption, 'India today successfully test fired for the second time it's long range nuclear capable Agni-5 missile that has a range of over 5000 kilometres. India now joins the select club of nations like United States, UK, Russia, France and China that have the capability to operate a missiles across continents, striking at will in Europe, Asia and Africa. The missile can carry a 1000 kg nuclear warhead and has three rocket motors and was launched from Wheeler Island in India.'.\n\nAgni-V missile is an intercontinental ballistic missile developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) of India.\n\nBOOM zoomed into the viral image and found that 'AGNI-5' was blurred off when compared to the original photo.\n\nBOOM has contacted ISRO to enquire whether a religious ceremony was performed before the launch of Chandrayaan 2. The article will be updated once we receive a response.\n\nNews reports suggest that ISRO chief K Sivan visited the Balaji Temple at Tirumala hill shrine and Sri Chengalamma temple in Sullurupet to pray for the success of the Chandrayaan 2 mission on July 14, 2019.
