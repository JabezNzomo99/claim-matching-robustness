The Israeli-Palestinian war is no exception.\n\nOn her Aug. 4 Reid Report, Joy Reid for their inability to stop or temper Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza. The UN\u2019s \"condemnations and expressions of outrage,\" Reid said, \"have done exactly nothing to protect civilians in Gaza.\"\n\n\"So far the war in Gaza has left more than 1,800 Palestinians dead -- the population equivalent to 100 9/11s.\"\n\nAmericans don\u2019t take the name of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in vain. So we wanted to dig into Reid\u2019s claim: Does her math check out, and is she right to compare the impact of the Palestinian deaths to what Reid defined as the American \"population equivalent\"?\n\nReid\u2019s math, and why 9/11s are not a unit\n\nTo consider Reid's claim, you need to first know that Reid is essentially looking at the percentage of deaths per population. For one part of the comparison, she's using the population of Gaza, which is pretty straightforward. For the other part of the comparison, she's choosing to use the entire population of the United States. And as we'll show you, that makes all the difference.\n\nReid's napkin math is relatively straightforward. Roughly 1,800 Palestinians have died out of 1.8 million in Gaza, which equals 0.1 percent of its population. Roughly 3,000 out of 300 million Americans died directly in the Sept. 11 attacks, which works out to 0.001 percent of America\u2019s population.\n\nCompare the two and you get that .1 percent is 100 times 0.001 percent. That\u2019s where \"100 9/11s\" comes from.\n\nIf you use slightly more precise numbers, it doesn\u2019t move the needle that much. The United Nations report issued on Aug. 4, when Reid made her claim, put the number of Palestinian deaths at 1,777 (not more than 1,800, as Reid said), and the .\n\non the Sept. 11 attacks from the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism puts the number of deaths in the Sept. 11 attacks at 2,997, and the United States Census Bureau population clock puts the U.S. population on Sept. 11, 2011, at 285,558,980.\n\nUsing those numbers, we get that Palestine\u2019s death count is the \"population equivalent\" of 93.22 9/11s when using the entire population of the United States. That's not quite Reid\u2019s 100, but it's not substantially different. But our fractional result does help demonstrate that 9/11s are not a particularly good unit of measurement. It\u2019s unclear what 0.22 of a 9/11 -- or for that matter, 100 9/11s -- would look like.\n\nComparing death tolls as proportions of population is misleading, experts told us.\n\nIn his book How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking, University of Wisconsin mathematician Jordan Ellenberg how, while occasionally useful, taking population equivalents quickly becomes ridiculous if you apply it to extreme cases.\n\nFor example, Ellenberg writes, the 1,074 Israelis killed by Palestinians from 2000-05 works out to 50,000 Americans, but if you scale down instead of up, it loses its punch. The same Israeli death toll, he says, is proportional to only one or two deaths in Tuvalu, a Polynesian island with roughly 1,000 inhabitants.\n\n\"When commentators in Israel and Palestine were observing 9/11 when it happened, people weren\u2019t saying, \u2018Imagine if 20 Palestinians had been killed,\u2019 \" Ellenberg told us.\n\nSimilarly, the Palestinian death count from the last couple of weeks is the \"population equivalent\" of about 1.3 million Chinese, but only one Tuvaluan -- not quite as rhetorically overwhelming as \"100 9/11s.\"\n\nThe problem, Ellenburg wrote in , is that our \"innate number sense simply doesn\u2019t extend\" to extremely small numbers. He uses the example of a Hezbollah bombing of the Israeli city of Haifa, which killed one in every 787,500 Israelis.\n\n\"Imagine that it was actually one in 78,750. You just multiplied the scale of the crime tenfold, but can you say sincerely that the two numbers inspire a different reaction? The proportions are just too small to comprehend.\"\n\nBeyond that, Ellenberg told us, \"there\u2019s a huge amount of wiggle room in how you count what population you divide by.\"\n\nIf you use just the population of New York City instead of the entire United States, the Palestinian death count works out to about three 9/11s. And if you limit yourself only to the population of Manhattan, you get less than one 9/11.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear which figure is the best choice to put the Palestinian death count in context -- or if any of them are even useful.\n\nReid's comment also can be seen as trying to create a moral equivalence. But that doesn\u2019t hold water, said Oxford ethicist Anders Herlitz. \"Most moral theories would say that the moral worth of individual lives are not comparable at all,\" Herlitz said. \"According to this line of thinking, we cannot measure the life of one against the life of many.\"\n\nThe only \"sound ethical theory\" that does let you make what philosophers call \"inter-personal comparisons\" is utilitarianism, Herlitz said, which posits that \"all lives are of equal worth. One Palestinian equals one Israeli equals one American, and so on.\"\n\nSo there\u2019s no ethical sense in which 1,800 Palestinian deaths are comparable to \"100 9/11s.\"\n\nReid, decrying the UN\u2019s failure to temper the rising death counts in Gaza, said, \"So far, the war in Gaza has left more than 1,800 Palestinians dead -- the population equivalent to 100 9/11s.\"\n\nShe used a couple of rough estimates, but Reid\u2019s math basically works out for the parameters she set.\n\nThe parameters, however, are the problem. Using 9/11s as a unit ignores qualitative differences between the Sept. 11 attack and the Israeli-Palestinian war. It\u2019s also not clear what populations she\u2019s referring to, and while looking at deaths as a proportion of population can be useful, the numbers here are too small for them to mean much.\n\nThere are also at least equally valid and different ways to compare deaths as a proportion of population that would produce vastly different results. (Going from 100 9/11s to less than 1 9/11.)\n\nReid\u2019s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
