The health care law has not been implemented yet, and the Kaiser survey, in fact, makes no judgment on whether the Affordable Care Act has played much of role in the increase in premiums. Indeed, the rate of the increase under Obama, a little under 6 percent per year, is more than half the rate of premium increases in the decade before Obama took office. The raw numbers, thus, obscure what many would consider to be a good-news story.\n\nStill, as we have noted in another column, the law mandates a robust package of benefits and requires that the amount an older individual pays will be no more than three times what a younger individual pays. So some people, such as a young male who currently has a plan that does not include all of the required benefits, are likely going to have sticker shock.\n\n\u201cThe IRS will be in charge of your health care\u201d\n\nWe have also written repeatedly about a CBO estimate that is frequently portrayed as saying the law would kill 800,000 jobs. The reality is more prosaic. Boiled down to plain English, the CBO essentially says that some people, who are now in the work force because they need health insurance, will decide to stop working because Obamacare guaranteed they would have access to health care. The 800,000-figure stems from a very rough guesstimate (percentage of gross domestic product) of the impact a decade from now.\n\nAs for the frequent claims about the impact of Obamacare on part-time employment, there\u2019s really not enough data to make a judgment. Yes, there are anecdotes here and there, but none of that adds up to a real trend. We encountered this issue when we examined the case of the City of Long Beach amid reports that it was shifting 1,600 workers to part-time because of the health care law. The initial reports were overstated.\n\nStill, one would expect the law to have some impact, especially at the margins. As of 2015, companies with more than 50 full-time workers must provide health insurance to all workers or face a $2,000 per person penalty, after the first 30 full-time employees. There also is a separate $3,000-per-employee targeted penalty if the employer coverage is inadequate or unaffordable, though it can\u2019t exceed the first penalty. Moreover, a full-time job is defined as just 30 hours per week.", "lang": "en"}
