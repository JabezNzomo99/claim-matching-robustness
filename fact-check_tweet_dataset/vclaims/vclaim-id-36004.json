Biden had traveled to Konar province in Afghanistan to pin a Silver Star on a Navy captain who had tried to save his dying friend by braving enemy fire, Biden said, rappelling into a ravine and carrying the friend out on his back. But the soldier didn\u2019t want the medal, because his friend didn\u2019t survive.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Sir, I don\u2019t want the damn thing!'\u201d Biden said, per the Post. \u201c\u2018Do not pin it on me, Sir! Please, Sir. Do not do that! He died. He died!'\u201d\n\nThe headline on the Post\u2019s story about Biden\u2019s statements reads, \u201cAs he campaigns for president, Joe Biden tells a moving but false war story,\u201d and the Post reported, \u201cBased on interviews with more than a dozen U.S. troops, their commanders and Biden campaign officials, it appears as though the former vice president has jumbled elements of at least three actual events into one story of bravery, compassion and regret that never happened.\u201d\n\nOne question raised by the Post was \u201cwhether President Trump\u2019s routine falsehoods have changed the standards by which other presidential aspirants, including Biden, should be judged,\u201d noting that Trump has \u201cuttered more than 12,000 false or misleading statements, The Washington Post has found. He has continued to add to that total since then.\u201d\n\nThe idea that the former vice president and 2020 Democratic front runner lied about a war hero was a sensational one, and it spread quickly. Shortly after the Post story was published, other news organizations from across the political spectrum followed suit. The incident \u201cnever happened\u201d or it was \u201cfabricated,\u201d echoed conservative outlets Fox News and Breitbart. \u201cJoe Biden tells false war story on campaign trail,\u201d reported a headline from the liberal MSNBC.\n\nThe Post reported Biden may have conflated the heroic actions of Kyle J. White, Miles Foltz and Chad Workman, all soldiers who were recognized for putting their lives at risk at different times and places in Afghanistan to help others.\n\nBut there\u2019s a difference between telling a story with the wrong details and telling a story that is fabricated. To claim that Biden\u2019s story is false might give readers the misleading impression that the soldier at the center of it doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nHe does exist, and he did, in his grief, tell Biden he didn\u2019t want the medal Biden pinned on him in 2011. In fact, the Post story contains an official White House image of Biden pinning a medal on Army Staff Sgt. Workman and quotes Workman confirming the central aspect of Biden\u2019s story, notwithstanding some of the finer details.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a Silver Star that Biden pinned on Workman, it was a Bronze Star. The site of the medal ceremony wasn\u2019t Konar province, it was Wardak. And Workman had tried to pull his friend from a burning vehicle, not a ravine. \u201cI never pulled him out because he was melting,\u201d Workman told the Post.\n\nWorkman described the events and encounter with Biden to the Post like this:\n\nWorkman\u2019s company commander told him that the vice president was going to pin a Bronze Star on him for his heroism. \u201cI tried to get out of going,\u201d recalled Workman, who has since been promoted to first sergeant. \u201cI didn\u2019t want that medal.\u201d Nevertheless on Jan. 11, 2011, a cold, gray day, Workman stood at attention as Biden pinned the medal to his chest. The moment is memorialized in a White House photo and in a 2016 interview that Biden did with National Geographic. Here\u2019s how Biden remembered it: \u201cYou see the look on his face \u2014 he says, \u2018Sir, I don\u2019t want it. I don\u2019t want it. He died. He died.\u2019 \u201d Workman\u2019s version is the same, but with one added detail. He recalled Biden meeting his gaze. Workman told the vice president that he didn\u2019t want the medal. Eight years later, Workman still remembers how Biden looked at him. \u201cHe has that look where his eyes can see into your eyes,\u201d Workman said. \u201cI felt like he really understood.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Post reported that Biden may have conflated separate events in his telling of the story on different occasions, Biden\u2019s campaign has not addressed that claim. Biden\u2019s campaign spokesman, Andrew Bates, declined to comment when we reached him by telephone, instead pointing to a statement published by the Post in which Bates said that Workman\u2019s story is \u201cemblematic of the duty and sacrifice of the 9/11 generation of veterans.\u201d\n\nBiden addressed the topic in an Aug. 30, 2019, podcast interview with the Post\u2019s Jonathan Capehart, pushing back on the Post\u2019s reporting that his statements were false, or represented one of a series of gaffes made by Biden:\n\nNow, the only thing I know, I\u2019ve been told, I have not read the story for real, I haven\u2019t seen it, I guess it came out this morning. But the assertion I made was there was a young man who I attempted to pin a medal on at the request of the commander. And he said, \u2018I don\u2019t want it, he died, he died.\u2019 Well, turns out, that\u2019s true. The young man did say that. They went back, I\u2019m told, I didn\u2019t see the story, and confirmed that yeah, that\u2019s exactly true. That\u2019s what I was talking about. There was a separate incident that occurred in a different time and a different circumstance. But what I was talking about was a young man \u2014 I mean what is the gaffe when I said there was a young man and I tried to pin a medal on him and he said, \u2018I don\u2019t want it sir. He died, he died, he died.\u2019 And it was a young man, my recollection was, that in fact pulled a colleague of his out of a burning Humvee, and he risked his life doing it, and the young man died, that he tried to save. His commanders asked me to pin the medal on him when I was in theater, and when I went to do it he said, \u2018I don\u2019t want it sir.\u2019 He took it, I pinned it on him. And he said, He died, sir, he died.\u2019 I was making the point how courageous these people are. How incredible they are, this generation of warriors, these fallen angels we\u2019ve lost. And so, I don\u2019t know what the problem is. I mean, what is it that I said wrong?", "lang": "en"}
