He was actually speaking about the economic benefits of global vaccination efforts.\n\nGates and his wife chair the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which, among other things, has committed billions of dollars to the research, development and delivery of vaccines.

Parts of the interview appear to have spliced together, removing key context surrounding Gates\u2019 comments. At no point does he claim to have made $200 billion in profits from his foundation\u2019s vaccination efforts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been $100 billion overall that the world\u2019s put in, our foundation is a bit more than $10 billion, and we feel there\u2019s been over a 20-to-one return,\u201d Gates actually said. \u201cSo if you just look at the economic benefits that\u2019s a pretty strong number compared to anything else. The human benefit in millions of lives saved.\u201d\n\nThe $200 billion-figure Quick mentions actually comes from the Copenhagen Consensus Center, a think tank that analyses comparative strategies in fighting poverty. Gates used the Copenhagen Consensus Center\u2019s estimate in a January 2019 Wall Street Journal op-ed to compare the impact of his foundation\u2019s $10 billion investment to the hypothetical impact on developing countries had he instead invested in other sectors, such as energy or infrastructure.\n\n\u201cBy investing in global health institutions, however, we exceed all those returns: The $10 billion that we gave to help provide vaccines, drugs, bed nets and other supplies in developing countries created an estimated $200 billion in social and economic benefits,\u201d Gates wrote.", "lang": "en"}
