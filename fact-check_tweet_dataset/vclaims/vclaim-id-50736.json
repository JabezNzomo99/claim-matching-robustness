They also added that the incident is unrelated to vehicle checking.\n\nA keyword search on Facebook led us to the same video uploaded by Patrika in 2017.\n\nAccording to Patrika, the man was fined for disrupting peace. The police claimed that he was misbehaving with people while in a state of inebriation. The man was brought to the police station where he allegedly misbehaved with the cops as well. At the time, the ASP had initiated an enquiry into the video.\n\nSince new traffic rules under MVA 2019 came into effect from September 1 and hefty penalties were imposed on violators, old videos of police excess have been shared as recent.", "lang": "en"}
