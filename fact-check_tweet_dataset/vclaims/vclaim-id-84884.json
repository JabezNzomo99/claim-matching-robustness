Still, as Washington Post opinion writer Greg Sargent pointed out, Trump has been hit from the right and the left for his speech, \u201cbecause it showed that Trump is trying to stake out positions on trade and wages that are to the left not just of GOP economic orthodoxy, but perhaps even to the left of Hillary Clinton and Democrats.\u201d\n\nOne statement that stood out was a revised version of his bungled claim during a November 2015 Republican primary debate about China and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. To our delight, Trump\u2019s campaign has begun releasing back-up materials (hello, footnotes!) to his major speeches, so we were able to get a sense of what he may be referring to this time. We took a look and found his point was still problematic, but just shy of a total whopper.\n\nDuring that primary debate, Trump said: \u201cThe TPP is horrible deal. It is a deal that is going to lead to nothing but trouble. It\u2019s a deal that was designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone.\u201d Our friends at PolitiFact rated this claim Pants on Fire, their worst rating saved for the most egregious falsehoods. Not only was China not a part of negotiating the deal, it is highly unlikely for China to \u201ctake advantage of\u201d the 12 TPP countries.\n\n\u201cWell, I know that China is not in the deal,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd if they look at speeches they will see I talk about it all the time, this deal is going to be a great deal for China. It is going to be unbelievable because China is going to come in through the backdoor, and that is what I said. They are going to come in later through the backdoor and they will take advantage of what all of these other people were negotiating, and the Wall Street Journal does a big editorial that I didn\u2019t know about China.\u201d\n\nThe footnotes in the prepared speech text appear to reference a technical aspect of trade law called the \u201crules of origin.\u201d Not all articles used to back up his claim actually relate to his argument, but some of them focus on indirect benefits that China might reap through the TPP due to rules of origin. Two of the articles specifically reference the impact of TPP\u2019s rules of origin on the auto industry. (If you really want to get wonky, read this report by the House Ways and Means Committee on the rules of origin relating to the auto industry.)\n\nThea Lee, deputy chief of staff of AFL-CIO which has been critical of the trade accord, said she would not consider the rules of origin as a \u201cback door\u201d into the deal, but that they represent a weakness that could allow non-TPP countries to circumvent tariff restrictions. She said: \u201cWithout ever joining TPP, without ever committing itself to market access, intellectual property protections, China will be able to get a lot of TPP because of the weak auto rule of origin.\u201d\n\nErin Ennis, the U.S.-China Business Council\u2019s senior vice president, has said China is \u201cexamining what it would take to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership even though the country is not yet able to comply with the agreement\u2019s commitments, and she called for more openness on the U.S. side to the possibility of China joining the deal,\u201d according to a report in an industry publication. As Slate noted, President Obama also has said that the Chinese have \u201calready started putting out feelers about the possibilities of them participating at some point\u201d in TPP.\n\nBut it still doesn\u2019t mean that Trump could declare with such absolute certainty that China \u201cwill enter TPP.\u201d It would take a long time for that to happen, and China already is negotiating a separate trade agreement comprising 10 countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Even if China ultimately decides to enter, the country will need to make major changes to its economy, international diplomacy and attitude toward free trade, said Mary Lovely, Syracuse University professor and international trade expert.\n\nIt\u2019s still not clear what Trump is referring to when he talks about a \u201cback door\u201d into TPP that China allegedly will use. We consulted a wide range of experts who support and oppose the trade accord, but they said there is no formal \u201cback door\u201d into the deal; rather, any non-TPP countries looking to enter would need to go through a formal accession process.\n\nAccording to the vague references provided in the speech footnotes, Trump may be referring to a technical aspect of trade law called the \u201crules of origin.\u201d If so, he really needs to make that clear, and provide more evidence as to how this provision constitutes a \u201cback door.\u201d While this statement by Trump is problematic, it does not quite rise to Four Pinocchios; immediately after saying China \u201cwill enter\u201d TPP, he contradicts himself by saying China is watching and studying and will enter \u201cif it is good,\u201d and \u201cif it is no good, they\u2019ll pass.\u201d Since he added that last caveat, we award Three Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
