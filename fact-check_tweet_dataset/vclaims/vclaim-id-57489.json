He and his wife Melinda chair the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which has pledged to donate up to $100 million to help fight the coronavirus pandemic, according to a statement from the charitable foundation.\n\nA March 23 Facebook post attributes to Gates a long statement about the \u201cspiritual purpose\u201d of the new virus. The statement calls it the \u201cgreat corrector\u201d and says that the virus is \u201creminding\u201d people of \u201chow materialistic\u201d society has become. (RELATED: Did Bill Gates Say, \u2018Be Nice To Nerds, Chances Are You\u2019ll End Up Working For One\u2019?)\n\n\u201cIt is reminding us of how materialistic our society has become and how, when in times of difficulty, we remember that it\u2019s the essentials that we need (food, water, medicine) as opposed to the luxuries that we sometimes unnecessarily give value to,\u201d the post credits Gates with saying.\n\nThere is, however, no record of Gates ever writing the statement. The Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any credible online sources attributing it to him, and a search of his verified social media accounts didn\u2019t turn up any similar comments. Nor does it appear on his blog GatesNotes.\n\nThe statement started circulating on email and messaging apps, such as WhatsApp, on March 23 before migrating to Facebook, according to The Independent. The Sun, a British newspaper, ran an article attributing the statement to Gates but later deleted the story.\n\n\u201cIn the heat of events yesterday, The Sun online mistakenly published a spoof story which was doing the rounds on email,\u201d a spokesperson for The Sun told The Independent. \u201cThe story has now been removed. Every day The Sun chooses not to publish hundreds of stories and we apologize for this error.\u201d\n\nA representative for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation confirmed to Buzzfeed News that Gates did not write the statement.", "lang": "en"}
