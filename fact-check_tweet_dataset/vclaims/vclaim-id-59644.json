Doucette is a Republican state representative for New Hampshire and also lists himself in the letter as the New Hampshire chairman of the Trump campaign.\n\nDoucette also shared the letter on Facebook where the text is a word-for-word match to the post\u2019s letter attributed to Eastwood. Doucette\u2019s letter was also shared on the Massachusetts Republican Party Facebook page with a photo of Eastwood. Accompanying the image is a quote purportedly by the actor saying, \u201cIf Congress really gave a rat\u2019s ass about the American people they would resign.\u201d\n\nAAP FactCheck was unable to find any evidence to link Eastwood to the quote, although he has previously disparaged Congress, calling them \u201clazy bastards\u201d in 2016 and in a 2013 interview he criticised Washington\u2019s legislators by saying \u201cit\u2019s almost like they don\u2019t give a damn\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s appears Eastwood was linked to the letter after his image was used in Doucette\u2019s Facebook post.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the claims in the Facebook post to be false. The letter attributed to Clint Eastwood in the post was written by Republican state representative for New Hampshire Fred Doucette. False \u2013 The primary claims of the content are factually inaccurate. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
