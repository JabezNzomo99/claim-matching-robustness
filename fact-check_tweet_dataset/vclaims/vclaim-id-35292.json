In the video, the page admins have added location tag of Shaheen Bagh. In the video, Irfan Pathan is accompanied by former Trinamool Congress lawmaker - Madan Mitra.\n\nThe video has over 80K views in just two weeks and has been shared more than 300 times. In the video, he can be seen greeting people around him.\n\n\n\nAn old unrelated video of Irfan Pathan falsely portrays his presence at Shaheen Bagh protests.\n\nThe Logical Indian found that the video is filmed in Kolkata and not Shaheen Bagh. Irfan Pathan was invited as a chief guest for local cricket in Kamarhati, West Bengal. He has also posted the same video from his verified Tik Tok handle. We used the music identifier application and found that the clip has been overlaid with a song titled - 'Pakistan Zindabad'.\n\nMadan Mitra's Facebook account also posted a few pictures of the tournament, where Irfan Pathan can be seen wearing the same outfit. Madan Mitra's outfit is also the same as seen in the viral video.\n\nMitra also shared some of the pictures with Irfan Khan and wrote, \"Some beautiful moments with ex-India cricketer par excellence Irfan Pathan for Kamarhati Premier Knock-Out cricket tournament organised by Kamarhati Development Society. Truly a moment to cherish to meet the man who is grace and humbleness personified.\"\n\nIrfan later through his Twitter account posted a short video of fans surrounding him with a caption mentioning that he was in Kolkata.\n\nHence it evident that the video was from Kolkata and not Shaheen Bagh.\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343\n\nAlso Read: Fact Check: No, Bengaluru Bus Conductor Did Not Clear UPSC Mains Exam, He Misled Media", "lang": "en"}
