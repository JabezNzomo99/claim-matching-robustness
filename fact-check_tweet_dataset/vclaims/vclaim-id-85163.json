But losing the popular vote by such a substantial margin apparently gnaws at Trump. Is there any basis for his claim?\n\nOur colleagues at Snopes.com and PundiFact have already examined this claim, back when it was hot in the right-wing blogosphere, not a statement made by a future U.S. president. The whole thing started with a few tweets by Gregg Phillips, a self-described conservative voter fraud specialist, who started making claims even before data on voter history was actually available in most jurisdictions. (It had not even been determined which provisional ballots were valid and would be counted.)\n\nThese claims were then picked up by such purveyors of false facts as Infowars.com, a conspiracy-minded website that, among other things, claims that no one actually died in a massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. One article described Phillips as being affiliated with VoterFraud.org but in reality he says he is the founder of VoteStand.com, supposedly an app that detects vote fraud. Phillips also has claimed that Obamacare is the \u201cbiggest voter registration fraud scheme in the history of the world\u201d because it provided opportunities for voter registration.\n\nIn any case, Phillips made this claim \u2014 and then has declined to provide any evidence to back it up, even though reporters have asked:\n\n\u201cHe said he has chosen not to release more information because he is still working on analyzing the data and verifying its accuracy,\u201d PundiFact reported. \u201cPhillips would also not say what the data is or where it came from, or what methodology he used.\u201d (Update, Nov. 30: Tynan, the reporter, published a long and interesting investigation into Phillips\u2019s claims.)\n\nIt\u2019s certainly rather odd that Phillips would make such a claim before he had verified whether it was true. He did not respond to a query from The Fact Checker after Trump tweeted, although he gleefully celebrated anger at his claim.\n\nBack when Trump was trailing in the polls and was threatening to dispute the election results because the system was \u201crigged,\u201d we\u2019ve previously given Trump four Pinocchios for making a number of bogus claims about alleged voter fraud.\n\nAmong other things, he falsely asserted that illegal immigrants were tipping the results in elections, based on a misinterpretation of disputed data. Even the researcher who produced the data said Trump was taking his findings out of context: \u201cOur results suggest that almost all elections in the U.S. are not determined by non-citizen participation, with occasional and very rare potential exceptions.\u201d\n\nA representative of the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for evidence of Trump\u2019s claim. It\u2019s worth noting that, unlike Trump, Phillips says he does not assume that all of the alleged illegal votes were cast for Clinton.\n\nNow that Trump is on the verge of becoming president, he needs to be more careful about making wild allegations with little basis in fact, especially if the claim emerged from a handful of tweets and conspiracy-minded websites. He will quickly find that such statements will undermine his authority on other matters.", "lang": "en"}
