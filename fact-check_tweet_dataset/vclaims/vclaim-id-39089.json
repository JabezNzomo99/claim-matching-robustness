No, that's not true: Bojangles' posted on Twitter that none of its employees had placed the sign on the door. Instead, it was taped on the outside of the door, indicating someone had likely placed it there as a hoax.\n\nThe claim appeared in a post (archived here) published by Kenneth Barnhill on March 4, 2020. It opened:\n\nUsers on social media saw this:\n\nThe post has generated thousands of shares, comments, and engagements. However, there are reasons to be skeptical about the origins of the sign.\n\nOn March 2, 2020, a Bojangles' shift manager locked the doors of a restaurant in Charlotte, North Carolina, before it was scheduled to close. The restaurant was not far from where President Trump was holding a \"Keep America Great\" rally at the Bojangles' Coliseum. Facebook user Michael Furick first posted about the incident:\n\nThe next day, the fast-food chain apologized to customers who were unable to purchase food the night before, according to the Charlotte Observer newspaper:\n\nThe controversy only worsened on Wednesday night after social media users posted a picture of a sign that had been taped on another one of the restaurant chain's front doors. The sign said:\n\nBojangles' responded to Twitter users to confirm one of its employees had not placed the sign on the door:\n\nAfter the incidents, some customers had threatened to boycott the chain. The Observer reported that the sign was likely deliberately placed by a customer to fan the flames:\n\nEven though a former employee had locked the doors to one restaurant earlier in the week, it is unlikely the Southern-based chicken chain would have a policy banning pro-Trump hats and shirts at any of its restaurants. The sign was likely a hoax to try to gain more social media attention after the first controversial incident. Either way, the company's official statement is that one of its employees did not place the sign on the door, and it welcomes all customers to its restaurants.\n\nBojangles' operates more than 750 locations, primarily in the southeastern United States and Mid-Atlantic states.", "lang": "en"}
