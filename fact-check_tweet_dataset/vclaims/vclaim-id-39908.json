The statistical release that includes the claimant count states clearly at the top: \u201cAs Universal Credit Full Service is rolled out in particular areas, the number of people recorded as being on the Claimant Count is therefore likely to rise.\u201d\n\nIn 2017 the Office for National Statistics (ONS) wrote: \u201cThe Claimant Count measures the number of people claiming unemployment-related benefits.\n\n\u201cPrior to 2013, the Claimant Count was measured using claimants of Jobseeker's Allowance.\n\n\u201cIn 2013 a new service, Universal Credit, which will replace a number of means-tested benefits, including the means-tested element of Jobseeker's Allowance, began to be rolled out\u2026\n\n\u201cUniversal Credit is designed so that a broader span of claimants is required to look for work than under Jobseeker's Allowance. This means that once Universal Credit is fully rolled out, the Claimant Count is likely to be higher than it would otherwise be under Jobseeker's Allowance.\n\nIt continued: \u201cWe believe the Claimant Count may now be providing a misleading representation of changes in the UK labour market.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time since the ONS made this statement that Mr Byrne has used the Claimant Count to talk about unemployment. Given the guidance from the ONS, it\u2019s inappropriate for him to continue doing this.", "lang": "en"}
