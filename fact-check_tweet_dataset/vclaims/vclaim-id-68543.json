But the West Virginia Democratic Party said in a recent tweet that it hasn\u2019t fallen on Republican Gov. Jim Justice\u2019s watch.\n\nIn a Jan. 9 tweet, the state party wrote, \"FACT: Unemployment rate has not decreased since @WVGovernor took office. #wvpol #WVSOTS19\"\n\nIs that correct? We decided to check it out. (We reached out to a party representative but did not receive a response.)\n\nJustice, elected as a Democrat in 2016, took office on Jan. 16, 2017. That month, the unemployment rate in West Virginia was 5.3 percent.\n\nJustice became a Republican on Aug. 3, 2017. That month, the state unemployment rate stood at 5.2 percent.\n\nAnd today? In the most recent month available, December 2018, the unemployment rate in West Virginia was 5.1 percent.\n\nIs that a dramatic drop? No. But unlike what the tweet says, it is a decline.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting a limitation in the data, said Brian Lego, a research assistant professor at West Virginia University. Because West Virginia\u2019s population is small, he said, the margin of error for the survey used to track the unemployment rate is big enough to produce uncertainty about small changes in the data, like those seen during Justice\u2019s tenure.\n\n\"The change is statistically insignificant,\" Lego said.\n\nHe added that regular revisions by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which collects the data, could produce small changes that affect the comparison.\n\nThe West Virginia Democratic Party tweeted, \"FACT: Unemployment rate has not decreased since @WVGovernor took office.\"\n\nThe state unemployment rate did, in fact, decline from 5.3 percent to 5.1 percent on Justice\u2019s watch. That said, it was an exceedingly narrow decline -- in fact, economists say that the margin of error for the survey in question leaves in doubt how big the decline was.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
