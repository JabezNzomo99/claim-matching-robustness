But did a Republican congressman from West Virginia get it right when he cited a statistic on that point in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed?\n\nU.S. Rep. Alex Mooney wrote March 25 that \"from 2000-10, U.S. manufacturing employment shrank by a third after holding steady for 30 years.\"\n\nMooney was broadly accurate when looking at raw employment totals. But the point does not hold up when you factor in population growth \u2014 a more telling statistic. (Mooney\u2019s staff did not respond to inquiries for this article.)\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at the raw numbers.\n\nThe number of U.S. manufacturing employees bounced around in a fairly narrow range between 1970 and 2000, before plunging between 2000 and 2010. (Left out by Mooney: National manufacturing employment has risen modestly but consistently since 2010.)\n\nSo that\u2019s in line with what Mooney wrote.\n\nBut if you adjust for the surge in U.S. population between 1970 and today, the pattern looks different.\n\nRather than \"holding steady for 30 years,\" the percentage of Americans working in manufacturing actually fell consistently between 1970 and 2000. The rate of decline accelerated a bit between 2000 and 2010, but not by much. And the percentage of Americans working in manufacturing has stabilized, and actually increased slightly, since 2010.\n\nGary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, agreed that the pattern depends heavily on which measure you use.\n\n\"Measured as a percentage of total employment, manufacturing employment has been falling pretty steadily since World War II,\" he said. \"The growth in manufacturing labor productivity, the growth of imported manufactured products as a share of the manufactured goods we consume, and the shift in consumers\u2019 taste away from manufactured goods toward services -- especially health care services -- has meant that we do not need as many U.S. manufacturing employees to produce all the manufactured goods we consume in a given year.\"\n\nWe were curious how the pattern looked for West Virginia.\n\nIt turns out that manufacturing jobs in West Virginia did remain pretty constant prior to 2000 before falling off a cliff.\n\nManufacturing jobs as a percentage of West Virginia\u2019s population held steady between 1990 and 2000, then dropped significantly between 2000 and 2010. As with the other measures, manufacturing employment as a percentage of the state\u2019s population has remained strikingly stable since 2010.\n\nMooney wrote that \"from 2000-10, U.S. manufacturing employment shrank by a third after holding steady for 30 years.\"\n\nMooney\u2019s statistic is accurate in raw numbers. The one caveat is if you measure manufacturing employment as a percentage of the population \u2014 which accounts for significant population growth over that period \u2014 you can see a steady decline going back decades. Manufacturing\u2019s footprint in the labor market shrank consistently, and by more than half, during the period he cited.\n\nWe rate the statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
