Based on existing U.S. government data, all the figures are false.\n\nThe image alleges, for example, that 81% of white murder victims are killed by Blacks. Data from the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice show on the contrary that more than 80% of white murder victims are killed by whites.\n\nPosts with the claim are visible here , here and here .\n\nThe image lists the following categories: \u201cwhites killing blacks 2%\u201d, \u201cpolice killing whites 3%\u201d, \u201cwhites killing whites 16%\u201d, \u201cblacks killing whites 81%\u201d, \u201cpolice killing blacks 1%\u201d and \u201cblacks killing blacks 97%\u201d. No dates are specified, and the data is attributed to \u201cstats from Wikipedia\u201d.\n\nIn the \u201cHomicide\u201d section of Wikipedia\u2019s Race and Crime in the United States entry here , the site quotes a report by the U.S. Department of Justice visible here (see page 13). The report, which analyzes Homicide Trends in the U.S. between 1980-2008, found that within that period \u201cmost murders were intraracial\u201d, with 84% of white victims killed by whites and 93% of Black victims killed by Black perpetrators.\n\nAccording to the FBI\u2019s Expanded Homicide data from 2018, the most recent report of this kind Reuters was able to find ( here ), 80.7% of the murders of white people were committed by white offenders (2,677 of a total of 3,315) while 15.5% of the murders of white people were committed by Black offenders (514).\n\nThe social media post also alleges white offenders committed 2% of the murders of Black victims. According to the FBI\u2019s data, 8% of the reported murders of Black people were committed by white offenders (234 of a total of 2,925) and 88.9% by Black offenders (2,600).\n\nFBI data from 2017 also follows this trend: 80.2% of white victims were killed by white offenders, 8.9% of Black victims were killed by whites, 88.5% of Black victims were killed by Blacks, and 16.1% of whites were killed by Blacks ( here ).\n\nA Reuters Fact Check visible here shows that FBI data for 2013 also maintained this trend.\n\nFalse. FBI data does not support the numbers put forth in this claim on interracial crime and police killings. Most U.S. murders for white and Black victims are intraracial.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
