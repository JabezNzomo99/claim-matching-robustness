The photos show a green-coloured building marked by crescent and star. It is claimed that this building is the Congress party\u2019s office in Wayanad. It may be noted that Wayanad has been in the news after Congress President Rahul Gandhi filed his nomination for the upcoming Lok Sabha election from there.\n\nThe above has been posted by a Facebook page Ghar Ghar Yogi. It has also been posted by individual users in droves.\n\nThe building seen in the photographs is the office of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML). It is not the office of the Congress party.\n\nIn the above picture, the features of the office marked as 1, 2 and 3 are indicators of why it is the IUML office and not the office of the Congress party. As can be seen,\n\n1. The symbol of the IUML is painted on the top left corner of the building. The party symbol of the IUML is the ladder.\n\n2. The person in the poster seen on the left side in the image is Syed Muhammedali Shihab. Shihab was the President of the Kerala state committee of the Indian Union Muslim League. He passed away in 2009.\n\n3. The words \u2018Iqbal Nagar League House\u2019 are written on the top right corner of the building, in Malayalam.\n\nCongress has been targeted repeatedly on social media over IUML motifs, particularly the banner of the party which is green in colour and has a crescent on it. This party banner has often been claimed to be the Pakistani flag, in order to portray the Congress party as sympathetic to Pakistan and Pakistanis. It may be noted that the IUML and the Congress party are in a pre-poll alliance in Kerala for the Lok Sabha election.", "lang": "en"}
