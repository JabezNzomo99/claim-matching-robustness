Along with the photograph, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson shared the story of how she had been standing in a hotel lobby when an American woman complimented her style, calling her \u201can iconic Manhattan dweller.\u201d\n\nSeveral Russian government media outlets, including RT, boosted Zakharova\u2019s Facebook post, and the official Twitter account of the Russian Embassy in the U.S. joined the chorus, with a tweet concluding with her response to the New York woman: \"I hate to ruin your dream, but I am Russian.\u201d\n\nThe original Facebook post triggered a tsunami of criticism from Zakharova's Russian followers.\n\nThere was a debate online on where she was standing \u2013 certainly not at or in a hotel. Zakharova was on 67th street in the tony Upper East Side, outside the Russian Mission to the U.N. and less than four blocks from New York\u2019s Central Park. \u200b\n\nThousands questioned Zakharova\u2019s \u201cpatriotism\u201d for wearing a foreign made outfit, asking her how she could afford such luxury items on a government salary.\n\nWhile Zakharova responded to some of the criticism, she ignored the questions about her salary \u2013 which could be a separate fact check. Zakharova is the only head of a Russian Foreign Ministry department who does not publicly disclose her income.\n\nFur certainly might strain the budget of a government employee, even at a senior level. A check of the U.S. online trading site, Ebay.com, reveals a full length leopard print on goat fur would cost 450,000 \u20bd. An Ocelot fur jacket was more reasonable, 140,000 \u20bd.\n\nIn an apparent show of support for domestic products, Zakharova said that her outfit in the photo was Russian (except for the bag \u2013 \u201cItalian\u201d -- and the sunglasses \u2013 \u201cpossibly Chinese\u201d).\n\nShe said her shoes were made by Vitacci \u2013 an Italian company with Russian connections. Yet her pumps are not among the 63 styles on the company\u2019s Web site. Maybe an older style?\n\nIt was Zakharova\u2019s fur coat that drew the most attention, both on Facebook and on Twitter. The \"official face of Russian diplomacy,\u201d as she is known, seems very fond of genuine fur coats. Indeed, on Instagram, she is seen wearing what looks like a genuine mink/silver fox fur coat.\n\nOn Facebook, the government employee also models a genuine fox fur coat.\n\nZakharova says her \"iconic Manhattan\u201d style leopard-pattern fur coat came from the \u201cexpo Ladya,\u201d held in Moscow last month. But Ladya\u2019s \u201cWinter Fairytale\u201d expo was dedicated to Russian traditional crafts and arts. Only three artisan businesses presented their traditional fur and leather craft items, and none of them produces luxury furs made with a leopard-skin pattern.\n\nThe press service of the Ladya National Crafts Exhibition at the World Trade Center in Moscow did not respond to a Polygraph.info inquiry about the participants in the December 2017 event.\n\nA related discussion on social media was whether Zakharova\u2019s coat was made of genuine fur and, if so, from which animal?\n\nMany Facebook followers guessed that the coat was made of genuine leopard fur. However, one man on Twitter responded to a Russian Consulate tweet by saying the coat was \u201cmade of 25 Ocelots.\u201d\n\nPolygraph.info attempted to ask Zakharova on Facebook about the origins of her coat, but its question was marked as spam less than three minutes after it was posted.The Foreign Ministry\u2019s press office has not responded to Polygraph.info\u2019s multiple inquiries related to the issue.\n\nPolygraph.info sent Zakharova\u2019s Facebook photograph (with her face obscured) to four experts on big cats. They all responded that they could not determine whether the coat was made out of genuine skin without touching it.\n\n\u201cIt appears to be an ocelot coat pattern,\u201d said William Swanson, director of animal research at the Cincinnati Zoo, who could not confirm whether the coat is made of real fur. \u201cBut I suspect it is real because the rosette pattern is so variable in the coat like you would see with combining pelts from different ocelots (fake fur is more likely to repeat the same patterns over and over),\u201d he said.\n\nThe Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is a United Nations body with 183 member countries that regulates international trade in species of fauna and flora to ensure it does not pose a threat to the survival of listed species.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why anyone would still be wearing a real coat like this \u2013 since it carries a social stigma these days - but there is no predicting propriety in people anymore,\u201d said Swanson, the zoo animal research director.", "lang": "en"}
