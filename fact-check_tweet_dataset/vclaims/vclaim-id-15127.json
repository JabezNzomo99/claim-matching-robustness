Others used ropes lowered by emergency services. However, four individuals fall to their deaths from the steep height, while trying to escape.]\n\nPeople speaking in Bengali can be heard in the video.\n\nNote the below video is extremely distressing in nature.\n\nBOOM first broke down the video into key frames and ran a reverse image search, which did not yield any results.\n\nWe then looked for the video across all social media platforms with the keywords from the viral message i.e. - 'Andheri', 'Raheja Mall', 'Mumbai' and 'fire'\n\nThe same video was uploaded to YouTube on April 16, 2019 with a caption that claimed the incident took place in Mumbai.\n\nHowever, in the comments section of the video a YouTube user pointed out that the video was actually from Dhaka.\n\nWe then went back to a reverse image search and changed Google's \"best guess\" field to \"Dhaka fire\" and were able to find an image which matched the video.\n\nWe found a 'visually similar' image belonging to stock images website Shutterstock. The signboards of 'Kindred' and 'Bata' in the photo matched those in the video. Other Shutterstock photos helped us confirm we were looking at the same fire. \n\n\n\nWe then performed a second reverse image search on the above image and were directed to news articles on the fire.\n\n\n\nAt least 25 people were killed, including six who fell to their deaths, and over 70 injured in a devastating fire that ripped through 22 storey FR Tower on March 28, 2019 in Dhaka's Banani area, an upmarket commercial hot spot of the Bangladeshi capital.\n\nTrapped office goers were seen screaming for help as worried onlookers from the adjacent Kemal Ataturk Avenue starting crowding below the building.\n\nBanglades's Daily Star reported that the fire broke out at 12.50 pm and it took 22 firefighting units, along with the army, the navy and the air force to douse the fire by 7 pm on March 28.", "lang": "en"}
