Bernie Sanders is wearing a bad grade as a badge of honor.\n\nThe Democratic presidential candidate is under fire since Sunday\u2019s debate for his votes on gun legislation, with chief rival Hillary Clinton eagerly highlighting his flip-flops on , among other issues.\n\nSanders got his chance to explain himself in Underwood, Iowa, when an audience member asked him about his past positions, which she said seemed more Republican. Sanders said that impression wasn\u2019t right.\n\n\"I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA,\" he said. \"Does that sound like a tool of the NRA? D-minus.\"\n\nWe wanted to know if his statement earned perfect marks.\n\nA spokesman for Sanders\u2019 campaign said Sanders\u2019 NRA grade came during the 2012 election cycle, as shown in the lobby group\u2019s The group awarded Republican John MacGovern, Sanders\u2019 unsuccessful challenger, an A.\n\nOf course, 2012 wasn\u2019t Sanders\u2019 first public-office rodeo.\n\nThe NRA (or technically its political action committee, the NRA-Political Victory Fund) has grades for Sanders as far back as 1992, when he ran for his second term for Congress as an independent from Vermont. (The NRA did not have earlier ratings available even though Sanders first ran for Congress in 1988 before winning in 1990.)\n\nThe grades the gun lobby did have on file show Sanders has never exactly been in its favor, with one sort-of exception.\n\nOur first thought: Man, the NRA really didn\u2019t like Sanders in the 1990s and early 2000s, awarding five straight Fs.\n\nThe NRA slightly warmed to Sanders in the mid 2000s, giving him a D-plus in 2004 and a C-minus in 2006, his first bid for the Senate.\n\nThat\u2019s mediocre but passing, right? The change of heart corresponds with Sanders voting in favor of the gun liability bill, which with NRA support. The bill also contained provisions for childproof trigger locks and a ban on body armor-piercing bullets, which Sanders mentioned as he explained his vote to the audience in Underwood.\n\nHowever, its most controversial provision was broad immunity for gun sellers, with a few exceptions, such as if the seller was negligent or knowingly broke the law in making the sale. The Democrats opposed this section, but the bill passed 283-144 in the House.

Ratings are compiled by lobbyists and analysts who know the issues in their specific region well, she said, and are generally not done for primaries.\n\nEach grade represents each election cycle, including all of the relevant gun issues in that politician\u2019s state and the country at that time.\n\n\"They only last through that election,\" Hunter said.\n\nClinton\u2019s most recent grade came in 2006 as she ran for re-election to the Senate in 2006.\n\nIt was an F.\n\nSanders said he has a \"D-minus grade\" from the NRA.\n\nHe\u2019s accurately referring to the most recent assessment from the gun lobby group in 2012. The NRA has not issued a more recent evaluation for Sanders for the 2016 primary election.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the grade is a few years old, and that his rating has been higher in previous election cycles. Still, a D-minus is far from a full-throated endorsement.\n\nHis claim is partially accurate but needs more clarifying information, so we rate it Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
