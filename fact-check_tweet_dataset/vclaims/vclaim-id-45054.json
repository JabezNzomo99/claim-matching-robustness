It reads, \u201c\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0927\u093e\u0928\u092e\u0902\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u092c\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u092c\u093e\u0924\u0947\u0902 1 \u0915\u0930\u094b\u0921\u093c \u0915\u094b\u0930\u094b\u0928\u093e \u092e\u0930\u0940\u091c\u093c\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u093e \u092b\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0907\u0932\u093e\u091c \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e (Prime Minister\u2019s big talk. 1 crore corona patients treated free of cost.)\u201d A bottom ticket on the screen also stated the Prime Minister as saying, \u201cAyushman Bharat has benefitted the poor people of this country.\u201d Based on the graphic, many individuals have mocked the PM stating that India has less than 2 lakh COVID-19 cases. while the total number of cases in the world is 62 lakh. Below is a tweet by lawyer Dushyant (@atti_cus) which garnered 8,600 likes and 3,500 retweets as of this writing.\n\nThe screengrab was also tweeted by Amina (@LuvAminaKausar) who describes herself as an American but Indian by heart.\n\nWriter Sanjukta Basu tweeted, \u201cSo Modi did say 1 crore COVID patients treated free. India has 182k patients and even the whole world doesn\u2019t have 1 crore.\u201d\n\nThe graphic also reached Facebook. Below is a post by the page Dr.Manmohan Singh \u2013 Fan Club.\n\nIndia TV airs erroneous graphic, PM Modi did not make the claim\n\nThe graphic was part of India TV\u2019s broadcast aired in the morning of May 31 where PM Modi\u2019s radio show \u2018Mann ki Baat\u2019 was played live. However, on June 1, India TV aired a correction. \u201cYesterday during the broadcast of Mann Ki Baat, it was reported that one crore patients of corona have been treated in India. This was a human mistake. Let us make it clear that the number of corona patients in India is not so high. We are sorry for this mistake.\u201d\n\nIndia TV\u2019s broadcast concerned PM Modi\u2019s \u2018Mann ki Baat\u2019 address on May 30 where he spoke about the coronavirus pandemic and the Ayushman Bharat health scheme which he said has helped the poor. He can be heard talking about the same 18 minutes onward in the show. The Prime Minister stated that the beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat scheme have crossed the figure of 1 crore. This was misreported by India TV as him claiming that 1 crore COVID-19 patients have been treated for free.\n\nTherefore, an erroneous video report by India TV led many social media users to target PM Modi. However, India TV later clarified that the channel made a mistake.", "lang": "en"}
