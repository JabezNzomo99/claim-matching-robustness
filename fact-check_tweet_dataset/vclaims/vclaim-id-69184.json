We searched Nexis and Google and found no evidence that Turner made such a statement.\n\nThe website dailynewsforamericans.com is largely about famous entertainers reacting to Trump. We found no disclaimer or contact information on the website, which calls itself a \"tested and trustworthy team\" but posts fake news.\n\nThe article only contains a headline and a link to an interview with Turner on the show of British talk show host Jonathan Ross in October.\n\nTurner didn\u2019t mention Trump at all during the interview.\n\nInstead, the interview covered topics such as the musical in development about her life, her marriage to Ike Turner and decision to leave him, her career and retirement.\n\nThe headline stated that Turner was thankful for our president for \"the first time in 8 years,\" a jab against Obama.\n\nWe didn\u2019t find many references to Turner weighing in on American presidential politics in recent years. In 2013, Turner relinquished her U.S. citizenship after living in Switzerland for about two decades.\n\nWe do know that at least in the beginning, she was a fan. The week that Obama won in 2008, a jubilant Turner performing at a concert in Orlando declared, \"We\u2019ve got a new president!\"\n\nAs for the story that Tina Turner said she is thankful for Trump, we rate this headline Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
