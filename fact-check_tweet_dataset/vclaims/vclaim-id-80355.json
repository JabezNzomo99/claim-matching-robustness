The tweet was not accompanied with any text.\n\nHowever, whoever photoshopped the original photo forgot to change the colour of the drink in the glass.\n\nThe original photo shows a bottle of water with a Kinley logo and not a bottle of whiskey.\n\nThe photo prompted angry comments from Twitter users who saw it as an affront to a beautiful example of Hindu-Muslim unity. Despite receiving nearly 200 comments at the time of writing this story, Nasreen has refrained from deleting the photo.\n\nAnd while we cannot trace the original photo with the bottle of water to a reliable source it has existed on the Internet months before the writer shared it.\n\nThe author herself has been a target for radical Islamic groups both in India and Bangladesh and has been vocal in her criticism of extremist ideology on the social media platform.\n\nNasreen created a stir in Bangladesh with her book 'Lajja' (Shame) in 1993. The novel was about the struggles of a Hindu family in Dhaka after the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh India in 1992.", "lang": "en"}
