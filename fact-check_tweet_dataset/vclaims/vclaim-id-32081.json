No credible media sources have covered the incident.\n\nPatricia Harrington, an 11-year-old in Butte, Montana, shot and killed two burglars with her father\u2019s shotgun during an attempted home invasion, according to the Facebook post. Harrington was alone when the men, allegedly illegal immigrants who had killed a man in a previous burglary, broke into her residence.\n\nThe Facebook post, which has been circulating since at least 2007, uses the home invasion tale to promote anti-illegal immigrant and pro-gun political views. It also criticizes news networks, including CNN and MSNBC, for not covering the story.\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that this scenario ever occurred. A LexisNexis search turned up several news articles about young people stopping home invasions with firearms, including an 11-year-old boy shooting and killing burglars in South Carolina, though none matched the details in the Facebook post.\n\nFox News nor any other major network reported the events because they never actually happened. Some local outlets in Montana did write about the home invasion, but only to debunk it.\n\nIn a 2007 interview with The Montana Standard, Butte-Silver Bow Sheriff John Walsh clarified that the incident was an urban legend, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how these things get around.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
