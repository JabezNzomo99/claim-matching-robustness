This is false; while Magu has been charged with alleged graft and suspended, the image being shared is doctored. The original is a stock photograph.\n\nThe picture posted on July 10, 2020, by Nigerian singer and activist Charlyboy has been shared hundreds of times on Facebook.\n\nIt claims to show anti-graft czar Magu in a jail cell -- a fate, the post implies, that also awaits Diezani Alison-Madueke, former minister of petroleum resources, who has been charged with fraud and money laundering.\n\nThe picture was also shared on Twitter, with the caption: \u201cGuys meet Ibrahim Magu... Imagine the head of an Anti-corruption agency behind bars and grilled for money laundering and fraud\u201d. The same caption has been used to share the image here on Facebook.\n\nOther archived Facebook posts carrying the claim can be seen here, here, here and here.\n\n\n\n On July 6, 2020, Nigeria media reported that secret police had arrested Magu. In response, the EFCC released a statement on the same day, saying that Magu had not been detained but only invited for questioning.\n\nMagu stands accused of laundering N500 billion ($1.3 billion) and allegedly buying property in the United Arab Emirates, according to local media. He has denied all allegations.\n\nThe questioning came after Nigeria's attorney general in June sent a memo to President Muhammadu Buhari detailing a raft of allegations against Magu that were leaked to the press, as AFP reported here.\n\nBuhari confirmed the suspension of Magu as acting chairman on July 10, 2020, as AFP reported here. Four days later, Magu was released on bail -- without bail conditions.\n\nJustice ministry spokesman Umar Gwandu said the suspension was \u201cin order to allow for unhindered inquiry by the presidential investigation panel\u201d.\n\nMagu is not the man seen in the photo. AFP Fact Check ran multiple reverse image searches, which led to the original picture on stock images site, Yayimages. The model\u2019s head has been digitally replaced with Magu\u2019s.\n\n\n\n The EFCC was set up to investigate financial crimes in Nigeria, such as internet fraud, money laundering, and embezzlement of public funds. It convicted three former state governors in Nigeria in 2019 alone.\n\nMagu was appointed the acting EFCC chairman in November 2015 -- and has remained in an acting capacity for almost five years because the Nigerian senate refuses to confirm his appointment.", "lang": "en"}
