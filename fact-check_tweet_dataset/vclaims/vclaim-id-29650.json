No, that's not true: a Spanish-language site put a misleading headline on an article about Coltrane's osteoarthritis and several posts appeared on social media linking to the article while making the claim he died.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Noticias Ecatepec on March 19, 2019 titled \"Hagrid, el actor en Harry Potter, pierde la batalla\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nAs you can see it cuts of right before mentioning the osteoarthritis part.\n\nThe URL of the story was \"https://noticiasecatepec.com/vip-farandula/muere-hagrid-el-actor-en-harry-potter/\". Note we highlighted the word \"muere\" which means \"dies\" in Spanish.\n\nThe \"news\" was also posted with the caption \"MURI\u00d3 HAGRID\" (\"Hagrid died\") on the Facebook page \"Noticias de Monterrey\" and again with a different misleading caption on Noticias de Jalisco and Noticias de Monterrey:\n\nThe websites mentioned on these pages all direct back to the Noticias Ecatepec website.\n\nIn reality Robbie Coltrane is only wheelchair-bound temporarily while awaiting an operation according to this report:\n\nThe 68-year-old, who played the beloved Rubeus Hagrid in the blockbuster franchise, battles with osteoarthritis which has left him in crippling pain and unable to walk. Robbie's now awaiting knee surgery in America to repair his joint that will hopefully relieve the pain.", "lang": "en"}
