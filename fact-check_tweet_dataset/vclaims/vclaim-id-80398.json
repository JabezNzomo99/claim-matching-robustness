Messages on Twitter and Facebook claimed that the names of five people arrested for stone pelting were 'Saddam', 'Aamir', 'Feroze', 'Nadeem' and 'Ashraf'.\n\n\"The names used on social media is an absolute canard and complete falsehood,\" Gurugram Commissioner of Police, Sandeep Khirwar told BOOM on Friday. \"The accused have already been arrested in the case and further investigations are on.\"\n\nHours after speaking to BOOM, the official handle of Gurugram Police also tweeted a denial on Twitter.\n\nEven though no evidence was provided to support the claim; several prominent Twitter handles took the lead in propagating conspiracy theories.\n\nIn a report filed by the Indian Express on Thursday, there is no mention of any Muslim being caught for the vandalism. The police have held 18 suspects, including eight minors and all of them belong to Rajput-dominated Bhondsi village that is situated about 500 meters from where the buses were attacked.\n\nThe attack on the school bus carrying children and teachers were condemned by people across social media. Many had expressed outrage how those invoking historic Rajput pride could attack defenceless children. The Karni Sena have denied their involvement in the incident and have blamed political parties for defaming them in a bid to scuttle their protest against Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Padmaavat.", "lang": "en"}
