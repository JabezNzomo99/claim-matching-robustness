Trump has referenced her foundation ties in the past, saying she needs to \"return the $25 million\" Saudi Arabia gave the foundation.\n\nThe William J. Clinton Foundation was incorporated in 1997. The foundation agreed to disclose its donors when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009.\n\nWe wondered whether the Clintons\u2019 donor list holds up to Trump\u2019s claim.\n\nBut first, it is important to note that political candidates cannot take money from foreign entities.\n\n\"The prohibition in the Federal Election Campaign Act is against candidates or political committees soliciting, accepting or receiving contributions from foreign nationals, not only governments,\" said Michael Malbin, a political science professor at the University at Albany.\n\nHillary Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin also noted that the former first lady played no role in the foundation while she was secretary of state.\n\n\"Further, she did not blink before standing up to countries that oppressed their people and denied them of their rights, from LGBT rights to women's rights,\" Schwerin said.\n\nNonetheless. looking at the Clinton Foundation\u2019s donor list, Saudi Arabia gave between $10 million and $25 million. But the foundation reported the Saudi money in December 2008, and the amount hasn\u2019t changed since. Clinton Foundation spokesman Brian Cookstra pointed out that Saudi Arabia did not give to the foundation while Secretary Clinton was at the State Department.\n\nThe foundation has also taken between $1 million and $5 million each from United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman. As The Wall Street Journal reported, several of these donations came in 2014, after Clinton's tenure at the State Department.\n\nWe've fact-checked a similar claim before when Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said in April 2015 that Clinton took money from the kings of \"Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Oman and Yemen.\" Every country except Yemen has contributed to the Clinton Foundation, but Preibus' claim made it seem like Clinton herself took the money. We rated it Half True.\n\nHuman Rights Watch tracks how women are treated in each of these countries.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, a woman needs \"male guardian\" approval on everything from obtaining a passport to seeking higher education. They also have no divorce rights.\n\nThe same male approval is needed for marriage in United Arab Emirates, plus laws there also allow a husband to assault his wife and children.\n\nIn Qatar, marital rape is permitted. Women need a male guardian to approve a marriage contract, and one law specifies that a wife must obey her husband.\n\nAnd in Oman, Human Rights Watch notes that while there is a nondiscrimination law, women still face discrimination when it comes to domestic issues such as child custody and divorce.\n\nAccording to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, all sex outside of marriage, including same-sex intercourse, in Saudi Arabia is punishable by death.\n\nFor a married man, the penalty is death by stoning. An unmarried man faces 100 blows of a whip.\n\nIn Qatar, any sexual act outside of marriage is punishable by death.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates also bans sex outside of marriage, and the death penalty could apply to consensual \"same-sex relations.\"\n\nAs for Oman, the country punishes same-sex acts by up to three years in prison.\n\nAs for Trump's claim that these countries are throwing gay people \"off of buildings,\" he may be referring to the Islamic State. There is evidence that ISIS has engaged in these acts, but in Syria.\n\nExecutions in Saudi Arabia specifically have increased recently, but specific convictions, and whether are they related to homosexuality, are hard to measure.\n\nExperts we spoke with questioned whether the donations to the foundation are directly attributable to Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"These were not donations to Secretary Clinton as such, but to an organization with which she was closely involved (when not in office or seeking it), including serving as a director,\" Lenkowsky said.\n\nAccording to Brian Mittendorf, an accounting professor at Ohio State University, nonprofits often have to consider donors\u2019 actions when they give money. The stakes are usually higher when the nonprofit involves a political figure.\n\n\"These are gifts not to Clinton herself but to the foundation that shares her name,\" he said.\n\nThe United States remains allies with some of these countries, such as Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar, despite their poor record with human rights.\n\nTrump said that Hillary Clinton has \"been given tens of millions of dollars by countries that treat women horribly...and countries that kill gays.\"\n\nTrump's comment oversimplifies donations to the Clinton Foundation to make a quick attack against his Democratic rival. He makes it sound as if Clinton personally received money from foreign governments with poor records on human rights. But political candidates cannot accept donations from foreign governments.\n\nHowever, several countries with harsh rules for women and that kill gays have contributed to the Clinton Foundation both before and after her tenure at the State Department.", "lang": "en"}
