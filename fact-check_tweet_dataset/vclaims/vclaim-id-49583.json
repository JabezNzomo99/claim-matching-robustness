The photographs have no link to the February 14, 2019 attack -- one is an old image of Indian soldiers which has circulated online since at least 2014, the other is a 2011 AFP photograph of soldiers in New Delhi wiping their faces of sweat in the heat.\n\nThe misleading posts first appeared February 15, 2019, for example here, one day after a suicide attack killed more than 40 Indian soldiers in Indian-administered Kashmir.\n\nHere is an AFP report from February 16, 2019 about the suicide attack.\n\nThe misleading claim has also been shared on Twitter, for example here where it has been shared more than 6,000 times.\n\nThe Hindi text above the photos in the misleading posts says: \u2018These are not coffins. These are our country\u2019s debts.\u2019\n\nThe English text above the photos reads: \u2018Cost of Freedom and Pain of loosing brothers !\u202c #RIPBravehearts Jai Hind\u2019\n\nThe #RIPBravehearts hashtag is being used on social media posts, for example here on Facebook and here on Twitter, to commemorate the February 14, 2019 suicide attack in Kashmir.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the first image used in the misleading post, which shows Indian soldiers with flag-draped coffins, has been posted online since at least 2014, for example here, here, and here.\n\nThe articles credit the image to the Reuters news agency and say it shows Central Reserve Police Force personnel paying their respects to colleagues killed in a Maoist attack in the state of Chhattisgarh, eastern India, in June 2010.\n\nThe bottom photo used in the misleading post shows a group of soldiers, two of whom are wiping their faces with white cloths.\n\nThe image is actually a 2011 AFP photograph of Indian soldiers at an event in New Delhi.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the original photograph on AFP's Image Forum website:\n\nThe caption of the image says: \u201cIndian armed forces personnel react to the heat during a march at India Gate after a tribute ceremony to commemorate twelve years since the victory of the Kargil war in New Delhi on July 26, 2011.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
