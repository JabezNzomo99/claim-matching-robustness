Certainly, her claim that her e-mails were immediately preserved has now been called into question \u2014 as has her statement that she complied with every rule in place at the time.\n\n\u201cThere are four things I want the public to know. First, when I got to work as secretary of state, I opted for convenience to use my personal e-mail account, which was allowed by the State Department, because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal e-mails instead of two. Looking back, it would\u2019ve been better if I\u2019d simply used a second e-mail account and carried a second phone, but at the time, this didn\u2019t seem like an issue.\u201d\n\nClinton has not disclosed who at the State Department approved the use of a personal e-mail account, with its own server, instead of a government account. One would expect there is a paper trail that would explain how and why approval was granted. (The technology for one phone to handle two email accounts was fairly nascent back in 2009.)\n\nThe State Department on March 13 acknowledged this was not the case. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters that not until this February were such e-mails automatically preserved. The system depended on individual officials deciding whether the e-mail met the definition of an official record that should be preserved. It is quite possible that if other officials were the recipients of an e-mail, rather than the originator, then they may not have understood that Clinton assumed they would be responsible for preserving the records.\n\nMoreover, even if the State Department system was working as efficiently as Clinton claimed, her statement doesn\u2019t address the fact that she e-mailed government officials who did not work at the State Department. Those e-mails also may have been lost unless the recipient decided to preserve them, depending on the procedures in place at that particular agency.\n\nThe State Department\u2019s letter actually appears to have been prompted by the discovery that Clinton had used a personal e-mail account for her State Department work, as officials were unable to locate e-mails in response to queries from the House Select Committee on Benghazi. The letter was generated after at least two months of discussion between the State Department and Clinton aides. But Clinton and the State Department have suggested this was a routine bookkeeping memo not aimed specifically at Clinton.\n\nInformation contained in a Q&A provided by Clinton aides suggests the \u201cthorough process\u201d consisted of looking for keywords and names of possible recipients, not specifically reviewing the e-mails to see whether they contained information that would be covered by the Federal Records Act. The search consisted of looking for e-mails sent to people with a \u201c.gov\u201d account, the first and last names of 100 government officials, and terms such as \u201cLibya\u201d or \u201cBenghazi.\u201d This yielded approximately 30,500 e-mails, which were turned over to the State Department. The other 32,000 e-mails in her possession were deemed \u201cpersonal\u201d and destroyed. (Update: In a statement issued March 15, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said \u201cthe fact sheet should have been clearer every email was read.\u201d)\n\nMoreover, as our colleagues at FactCheck.org pointed out, the State Department foreign affairs manual says \u201cno expectation of privacy or confidentiality applies\u201d to e-mails that are sent on government e-mail accounts, even if they are personal in nature. The Clinton Q&A claimed that \u201cgovernment officials are granted the privacy of their personal, non-work-related e-mails, including personal e-mails on .gov accounts. Clinton exercised her privilege to ensure the continued privacy of her personal, non-work-related e-mails.\u201d But that statement is not accurate.\n\nWhile Clinton touts her \u201cunprecedented\u201d step, her use of a personal e-mail account for all work correspondence also appears unprecedented, at least in the first term of the Obama administration. A survey by the Wall Street Journal found that no other Cabinet official used a personal e-mail account, on a private server, for work-related e-mails. Some officials, such as Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and Kathleen Sebelius, former health and human services secretary, had a personal and work account \u2014 but used a second device.\n\n[Update, August 12: This statement turned out to be incorrect. The Inspector General of the Intelligence Community sent a letter to Congress, saying that at least two emails contained classified information at the email was created. It\u2019s unclear if this information was contained in an email that Clinton sent or in an email that she received.]\n\nThe Fact Checker covered most of these rules in our timeline about the Clinton controversy. Certainly, the law became clearer after Clinton stepped down. But even when Clinton was secretary, the State Department emphasized that a personal e-mail account was not a preferred mode of communication \u2014 and that it was the responsibility of officials using a personal e-mail account to make sure that \u201cfederal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system.\u201d A cable was even issued under Clinton\u2019s name that warned: \u201cAvoid conducting official Department business from your personal e-mail accounts.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
