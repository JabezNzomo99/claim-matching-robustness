No, none of that is true: The claims of a woman ranting outside a grocery store about the illegality of mandatory mask rules, the health risks associated with wearing a mask, and the mildness of the novel coronvirus are unsupported by legal and medical evidence. Her theory that COVID-19 is a conspiracy to kill Mexicans, blacks and everyone else is also not backed by facts.\n\nThe video has been widely shared on social media to support claims that citizens don't have to wear masks and shouldn't. It appeared as a post (archived here) on Facebook on May 21, 2020. The Facebook poster wrote this introduction:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nThe woman in the video appears to be taking photographs of the signs outside a store and begins talking to people off-camera about wearing masks. She predicts a lot of lawsuits will be filed by people suing stores for illegally requiring customers to wear face masks:\n\nThe ADA -- the Americans With Disabilities Act -- has nothing to do with whether governments or business can require customers to protect themselves and others by wearing face masks. Lead Stories debunked the claim previously with our investigation into a meme that advised people to invoke the ADA as a defense against masks. Read Fact Check: Card Does NOT Exempt Anyone From Wearing A Mask In Public\n\nAt present, portions of 39 states have face-covering requirements for public areas amid the coronavirus outbreak, CNET.com reported. The requirements are often in the form of local ordinances, enforced by fines, citations or even jail terms. Lead Stories has not turned up any federal or state laws that would block mask requirements by local governments or businesses.\n\nThe purpose of wearing masks amid the COVID-19 outbreak is to help reduce the chances of transmission. The masks reduce contact with infectious droplets that are expelled when someone infected coughs or sneezes.\n\nAccording to the EEOC, there have been new guidelines implemented for the American Disabilities Act amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The ADA allows businesses to require people to wear masks if an individual would pose a direct threat to the health and safety of others, LaborandEmploymentLawUpdate.com reported. The EEOC \"has declared that the COVID-19 pandemic meets the direct threat standard, based on guidance from the CDC and public health authorities regarding the risk of community spread and institution of restrictions.\"\n\nHowever, if a person has a disability that prevents them from wearing a mask, that must be taken into account by the store. From LaborandEmploymentLawUpdate.com:\n\n\n\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic is currently considered a direct threat by the EEOC, a business would likely be on solid ground to require customers to wear face masks or covering when entering into their premises. That said, a business would not have the absolute right to refuse to provide a customer service based upon the customer's refusal to wear a mask.\n\nCurrently, the CDC (Center for Disease Control) recommends wearing a cloth face covering while out in public which you can read here and here.\n\nAs for the woman's claim that the mask rules are \"just made up by Bill Gates and them,\" Gates is a private citizen who happens to be one of the most generous billionaire philanthropists in the world. But he does not have the power to impose mask rules on citizens in any state or city.\n\nThe woman then tells another woman who was apparently wearing a mask that it would make her sick:\n\nNote the woman said \"carbon monoxide,\" which is a gas produced by burning gasoline or other fuel and is not created by the body. It is carbon dioxide that is exhaled by the body.\n\nThis claim has been circulating about mask-wearing causeing an unhealthy buildup of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream. LeadStories.com debunked this \"hypercapnia\" theory in an article titled Fact Check: Hypercapnia Does NOT Occur From Constant Use Of A Mask As Advised During The COVID-19 Outbreak\n\nAccording to HealthFeedback.org consistent use of a mask does not cause hypercapnia.\n\nHealthFeedback.org gives an expert opinion on the warning about masks causing hypercapnia. Sofia Morra, a cardiologist at the Erasme University Hospital in Brussels, explained:\n\nIt also appeared that the woman claimed masks do not protect against coronavirus, saying \"Go look on the package it will tell you it will not protect you from COVID-19.\"\n\nWearing a mask is meant to reduce the spread of the virus, especially from asymptomatic people, not specifically to protect the wearer from the virus. In other words, it's to protect others from whatever the person wearing the mask might have. The CDC explains why it recommends wearing a \"cloth face covering.\"\n\nThe woman also claims that \"they\" -- a group she doesn't identify -- \"want to kill all the Mexicans, they want to kill all the Black people. They want to kill everyone.\" This may be seeded in the false conspiracy theory that Gates has a plan to \"depopulate\" the world and COVID-19 is part of the plot. Lead Stories previously addressed that in an article titled Fact Check: NO Plan By Bill Gates And The Vatican To Depopulate World With Coronavirus Vaccine; Video Misinterprets Gates' Speech.\n\nThe woman's claim that COVID-19 is no worse than the flu or a cold is also false. She said was \"like any other virus.\" ICU doctors and researchers agree COVID-19 is a deadly monster with a mortality toll worse than the seasonal flu. The numbers also say this. Nearly 100,000 Americans died from COVID-19 in March, April, and May of 2020 -- a far faster death rate than the flu. Read Fact Check: The Flu Did NOT Kill 80,000 People In the United States Last Year.\n\n\n\nIt is always good advice not to stake your health on advice from someone ranting in the grocery store parking lot about a plot to kill everyone it the world. It is also good advice not to share the false wisdom with your friends.", "lang": "en"}
