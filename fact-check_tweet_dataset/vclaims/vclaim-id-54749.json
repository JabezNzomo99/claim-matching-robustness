Trump\u2019s campaign manager confirmed in a tweet that the image was fabricated.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention formally recommended on April 3 that Americans wear face coverings in public to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus, NPR reported. Shortly thereafter, social media users started sharing alleged screen grabs of Trump\u2019s campaign website showing red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d face masks available for purchase.\n\nThe screen grabs appear to be fake, however. No face masks could be found on the Trump campaign\u2019s online store. Had Trump\u2019s campaign started selling such products, it would have been picked up by the media, yet none have reported on it. (RELATED: Did Trump Tweet That He Won\u2019t Send Stimulus Checks To People Who Tweet \u2018#NotMyPresident\u2019?)\n\nABC News reporter Will Steakin debunked the masks as fake on Twitter after former Democratic congressional candidate Randy Bryce tweeted a supposed screen grab from the Trump campaign website. The claim appears to have originated with Bryce, though his tweet has since been deleted.\n\n\u201cYou knew it was coming,\u201d read Bryce\u2019s now-deleted tweet. \u201cIf I was a betting man I\u2019d guess they\u2019re not made in the United States. #COVID-19.\u201d\n\nBrad Parscale, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, also addressed the image on Twitter, confirming that it was fake.\n\n\u201cThis is FAKE. Leave it to a former DEMOCRAT candidate for Congress to come up with this crap. Also, FYI every single piece of @TeamTrump merchandise is Made in America,\u201d Parscale tweeted. \u201cIf it\u2019s not, it\u2019s fake. Just like this one.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
