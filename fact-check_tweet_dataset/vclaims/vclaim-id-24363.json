Aarey Colony is characterized by a considerable patch of greenery in the city.\n\nIn the video, the lion can be seen walking past the road, as stunned motorists halt to capture the same on their phones.\n\nAarey Milk Colony, located near Mumbai\u2019s Goregaon East, was established decades ago, as a dairy colony.
