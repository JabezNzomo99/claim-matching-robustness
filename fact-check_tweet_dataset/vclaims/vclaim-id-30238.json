When he said that the bible is a dangerous book, he was referring to Christians in some countries being persecuted because of owning the Holy Book. Neither did he say that people should listen to him instead of reading the bible.\n\nIn a prologue he wrote for the release of the 2015 German edition of the Youcat bible, he noted the challenges some Christians are facing because of their possession of the bible.\n\nI\u2019ll tell you something: There are more persecuted Christians in the world today than in the early days of the Church. And why are they persecuted? They are persecuted because they wear a cross and bear witness to Jesus. They are convicted because they own a Bible. The Bible is, therefore, a highly dangerous book \u2013 so dangerous that you are treated in some countries as if you were hiding hand grenades in your closet.\n\nThe Pope did not say that believers should rather listen to him than read the Holy Scripture as claimed in the Facebook post. Instead, he counseled the youth about the importance of reading the bible.\n\nWe also reached out to the Facebook page for the source of the quote.

A day after the incident, the pontiff issued an apology.", "lang": "en"}
