A couple of the posts explicitly linked it to the Bettel incident.\n\nThe posts are incorrect. We\u2019ve checked a number of these issues before.\n\nA key problem was that the figures for the EU budget from 2021 onwards haven\u2019t been released yet, so we can\u2019t know what individual countries will pay in and get back. The posts use data which they say is from 2018 to try and estimate what these figures will be.\n\nThere are also separate problems with the specific claim that Luxembourg gets back 3,304% of what it pays in as an EU member. The amount that Luxembourg received in EU spending in 2018 was roughly 105% of what it paid in to the EU budget (this can also be expressed as getting back 5% more than it paid in). In that year, 16 other EU countries received more money\u2014relative to what they paid in\u2014than Luxembourg.\n\nThe EU budget also spent around \u20ac1.6 billion on administration in Luxembourg in 2018. This covers things like EU staff salaries and building costs related to EU institutions within Luxembourg\u2014like the Court of Justice of the European Union. This money is not counted as spending on Luxembourg itself. However, even if it was counted as spending on Luxembourg, the country would get around 460% more than it paid in\u2014still nowhere near 3,304%.\n\nLuxembourg apart, the order in which countries appear in the post, in terms of how much they pay into the EU and get back, is fairly accurate.", "lang": "en"}
