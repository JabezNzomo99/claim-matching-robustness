The photo of the same notice is being shared (archived) on social media since March 2020. In the notice, it was written that Saint Luke\u2019s Hospital research showed consuming alcoholic beverages may help reduce the risk of infection by COVID-19. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Saint Luke\u2019s Hospital recommends alcohol consumption to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection. Fact: Saint Luke\u2019s Hospital authorities have clarified that the notice is not authentic; it is fake. Also, in one of its documents, \u2018WHO \u2013 Europe\u2019 has said that \u2018consuming alcohol will not destroy the virus, and its consumption is likely to increase the health risks if a person becomes infected with the virus\u2019. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched about the notice given in the post, it was found that Saint Luke\u2019s Hospital authorities have already clarified regarding this issue in March 2020. They have also clarified the same on their social media accounts (Facebook and Twitter). In another tweet, Saint Luke\u2019s Hospital authorities have said that \u2018vodka has no impact on the coronavirus\u2019. So, fake notice with false claims is being shared in the name of Saint Luke\u2019s Hospital.\n\nAlso, in one its documents, \u2018WHO \u2013 Europe\u2019 has said that \u2018consuming alcohol will not destroy the virus, and its consumption is likely to increase the health risks if a person becomes infected with the virus. Alcohol (at a concentration of at least 60% by volume) works as a disinfectant on your skin, but it has no such effect within your system when ingested.\u2019 It ends the report with the suggestion \u2013 \u2018under no circumstances should you drink any type of alcoholic product as a means of preventing or treating COVID-19 infection\u2019.\n\nTo sum it up, the notice of Saint Luke\u2019s Hospital recommending alcohol consumption to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection is fake.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
