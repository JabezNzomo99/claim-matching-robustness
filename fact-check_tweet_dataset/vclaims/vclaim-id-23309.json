The aid was reduced about 23 percent during Trump\u2019s first two years.\n\u2022 None Hickenlooper and Sen. Bernie Sanders both alluded to a deadline for climate change, but scientists say it\u2019s the wrong way of thinking about it.\n\u2022 Sanders repeated an old, misleading claim that 83% of the benefits from the Republican tax law go to the top 1% of income earners. That won\u2019t be true until 2027, when most of the individual income tax changes expire unless Congress extends them.\n\u2022 Pushing back against Trump\u2019s claims that the economy is doing great, Sen. Kamala Harris said, \u201cWell yeah people in America are working \u2014 they\u2019re working two and three jobs.\u201d The percentage of American workers holding multiple jobs is 5 percent and is virtually unchanged from when Trump took office.\n\u2022 Biden accused Harris of \u201ca mischaracterization of my position across the board\u201d after she confronted him on his past opposition to school busing and his recent comments about working with \u201csome civility\u201d in the 1970s with two segregationist southern Democrats. Both candidates have a point.\n\u2022 California Rep. Eric Swalwell said he was \u201cthe only person on this stage who has voted and passed background checks.\u201d That\u2019s false. A campaign spokesperson said he was referring to \u201cuniversal background checks,\u201d but even that claim is misleading.\n\u2022 None Hickenlooper said, inaccurately, that the Green New Deal promises every American a government job. The nonbinding resolution guarantees a job, but not necessarily one in government.\n\u2022 Sanders claimed that Trump tried to \u201cthrow 32 million people off their health care that they have,\u201d a figure that includes people who would choose to no longer purchase insurance if Congress repealed the Affordable Care Act without replacing it.\n\u2022 Sanders repeated an erroneous claim from his 2016 presidential campaign that the U.S. has the \u201chighest rate of childhood poverty.\u201d While the country does have a high relative child poverty rate, several other countries have worse rates.\n\nNight two of the primary election debates, on June 27, was again hosted by NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden falsely claimed President Trump \u201cimmediately discontinued\u201d an aid program to Central America, and implied that\u2019s the cause of surging immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nIn fact, the Obama-era aid program was reduced only about 23 percent during Trump\u2019s first two years, while illegal border crossings surged to more than triple the levels than before the Obama aid program commenced. Trump has already relented on a recent threat to cut off the aid entirely.\n\nBiden was referring to the \u201cU.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America,\u201d which began under Obama in fiscal year 2016 at a level of $750 million, according to a June 12 report by the Congressional Research Service, an arm of the Library of Congress. (See Table 5, page 13.)\n\nAppropriations for the program had already decreased to just under $685 million by fiscal year 2017, which began Oct. 1, 2016, before Trump was elected and nearly four months before he took office.\n\nFrom there, appropriations fell further to an estimated $527.6 million in the current fiscal year, according to the CRS report. That\u2019s a reduction of just under 23 percent.\n\nTrump\u2019s budget request for fiscal 2020, which begins Oct. 1, calls for a further cut to $445 million \u2014 which would represent a cumulative reduction in annual appropriation levels of 35 percent since the last fiscal year that began under Obama.\n\nIn March, however, Trump told reporters, \u201cI\u2019ve ended payments to Guatemala, to Honduras, and to El Salvador. No money goes there anymore.\u201d He directed the State Department to withhold appropriated aid funds. But that was a response to \u2014 not a cause of \u2014 the renewed surge in immigration.\n\nAt the time Trump spoke, March apprehensions of immigrants illegally attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border were surging to 92,840, more than triple the level of March 2015, prior to the aid program to which Biden referred. Far from being \u201cabated,\u201d the \u201ccrisis\u201d of which Biden spoke had come back with a vengeance.\n\nTrump has since relented on his threat. On June 18 \u2014 after widespread criticism \u2014 his administration said it would go ahead with $432 million in projects and grants that had been previously approved \u2014 out of the $615 million in aid that Trump had ordered to be frozen.\n\nTwo candidates, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and Sen. Bernie Sanders, mentioned time frames in their discussions of climate change that could use some additional context.\n\nHickenlooper, who studied to be a geologist, and is a two-term former governor of Colorado, said in response to a question about climate change, \u201cI share the sense of urgency. I\u2019m a scientist, so I recognize that we\u2019re within 10 or 12 years of actually, you know, suffering irreversible damage.\u201d\n\nSanders later said, \u201cThe scientists tell us we are 12 years before there is irreparable damage to this planet.\u201d\n\nThe 12-year figure is frequently mentioned by the press and politicians, and is extrapolated from a 2018 special report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which found that global warming \u201cis likely to reach 1.5\u00b0C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate.\u201d The world has already warmed about 1 degree Celsius.\n\nThe report also concluded that to stave off warming beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels \u2014 and avoid the many climate change effects \u2014 the world would have to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and be net-zero by 2050.\n\nIn 2018, that statement was taken by many to mean there were only 12 years left to do something about climate change. But many scientists have since come forward to say that\u2019s the wrong way of thinking about it.\n\nMyles Allen, an author of the IPCC report and the leader of the ECI Climate Research Programme at the University of Oxford, explained in a Conversation story he wrote in April that the IPCC\u2019s timing is only a best estimate.\n\n\u201cPlease stop saying something globally bad is going to happen in 2030,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBad stuff is already happening and every half a degree of warming matters, but the IPCC does not draw a \u2018planetary boundary\u2019 at 1.5\u00b0C beyond which lie climate dragons.\u201d\n\nKristie L. Ebi, director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at the University of Washington in Seattle, told the AP, \u201cThis has been a persistent source of confusion,\u201d adding, \u201cThe report never said we only have 12 years left.\u201d\n\nAnd Kate Marvel, a NASA climate scientist, told Axios in January, \u201c12 years isn\u2019t a deadline, and climate change isn\u2019t a cliff we fall off \u2014 it\u2019s a slope we slide down.\u201d She added, \u201cWe don\u2019t have 12 years to prevent climate change \u2014 we have no time. It\u2019s already here. And even under a business-as-usual scenario, the world isn\u2019t going to end in exactly twelve years.\u201d\n\nSanders repeated the same misleading claim about the Republican tax law that he and other Democrats have recited since the law passed at the end of 2017.\n\nSanders said during the debate, \u201c83% of your tax benefits go to the 1%.\u201d\n\nBut that won\u2019t be true until 2027, when most of the individual income tax changes will have expired.\n\nWe\u2019ve written about this claim before \u2014 when Sanders said it during a CNN town hall and when Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said it shortly after the law passed.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris also partly echoed the claim during the debate, saying that she would repeal the \u201ctax bill that benefits the top 1% and the biggest corporations in this country.\u201d\n\nMost of the individual income tax provisions expire after 2025, which will shift most of the tax benefits to the top 1%. An analysis by the Tax Policy Center found that the top 1% of income earners would get 20.5% of the tax cut benefits in 2018. That percentage would go up to 25.3% in 2025 and then jump to 82.8% in 2027.\n\nBefore the law was passed, Republicans said that they expected a future Congress to extend the individual income tax cuts, instead of allowing taxes for many to increase. They structured the law that way so they could pass their tax bill through budget reconciliation, a process requiring only a majority vote in the Senate, which meant that Republican lawmakers could not add more than $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. Also, they couldn\u2019t have a bill that added to the deficit beyond that 10-year window.\n\nSo, while it will be true that 83% of the tax cut benefits will go to the top 1% of income earners in 2027 if Congress doesn\u2019t act before then, it is misleading to give that statistic without context.\n\nPushing back against President Trump\u2019s claims that the economy is doing great, Sen. Kamala Harris said, \u201cWell yeah, people in America are working \u2014 they\u2019re working two and three jobs.\u201d The percentage of American workers who hold multiple jobs is virtually unchanged from when Trump took office, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 7,855,000 people who held multiple jobs in May, or 5 percent of all those who are employed. That percentage has remained virtually unchanged during Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 it was 4.9 percent in January 2017 when he took office. In fact, the percentage of the employed working multiple jobs has hovered around 5 percent since late 2009, and it\u2019s lower than the roughly 6 percent of workers who held multiple jobs during the late 1990s.\n\nLooking deeper into the 7,855,000 who held multiple jobs in May, the majority \u2014 4.4 million \u2014 were people with full-time jobs who had a secondary part-time job, according to a BLS news release (See Table A-18). Another nearly 2 million had two part-time jobs, and about 325,000 held two full-time jobs.\n\nWe looked into a similar claim last July when then-congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrongly claimed that the low U.S. unemployment rate was \u201cbecause everyone has two jobs.\u201d The number of people holding more than one job has no bearing on the unemployment rate.\n\nIn one of the most contentious moments of the debate, Harris confronted Biden on two race-related issues: Biden\u2019s past opposition to school busing and his recent comments about working with \u201csome civility\u201d in the 1970s with two segregationist southern Democrats, Sens. James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia.\n\nHarris, who is black, accurately noted that Biden \u201cworked with them to oppose busing,\u201d and told the story of her own school integration experience as an elementary student. As we have written, Berkeley public schools in California began busing students to fully integrate the school district in 1968, and Harris began attending Thousands Oaks Elementary School in 1970.\n\nBiden, who was first elected to the Senate in 1972, accused Harris of \u201ca mischaracterization of my position across the board.\u201d In telling her personal story, Harris left out a key detail: It was the local school district\u2019s decision to integrate its schools.\n\nThe former vice president said he opposed busing \u201cordered by the Department of Education,\u201d or what critics called \u201cforced busing,\u201d in the 1970s. \u201cYou would have been able to go to school the same exact way because it was a local decision made by your city council,\u201d Biden said. In fact, Harris was attending an integrated school before Biden even joined the Senate.\n\nBut Harris did not mischaracterize Biden\u2019s comments about Eastland and Talmadge, so she did not mischaracterize his position \u201cacross the board.\u201d\n\nHarris said \u201cit was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country.\u201d Biden responded by saying, \u201cI did not praise racists.\u201d Harris didn\u2019t say he did. She said he talked about their reputations, and Biden did say that he was able to work with them in a civil way to get things done in the Senate, despite their political and personal differences.\n\nAt a June 18 fundraiser in New York, Biden described Talmadge as \u201cone of the meanest guys I ever knew,\u201d and said Eastland referred to him as \u201cson\u201d instead of senator, which he took as a sign of disrespect.\n\nBut, in comparison to the current political climate in Washington, Biden went on to say: \u201cAt least there was some civility. We got things done. We didn\u2019t agree on much of anything. We got things done. We got it finished. But today, you look at the other side and you\u2019re the enemy. Not the opposition, the enemy. We don\u2019t talk to each other anymore.\u201d\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell, trying to distinguish himself from the other candidates on gun issues, said he was \u201cthe only person on stage who has voted and passed background checks.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s clearly false. Biden, for example, was in the Senate in 1993 and voted for the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which became law. It requires federally licensed firearms dealers to conduct background checks on most gun transfers to prospective buyers.\n\nSwalwell\u2019s campaign explained that the California congressman meant he \u201cwas the only person on stage who has voted for and passed universal background checks.\u201d\n\nSwalwell did vote for the Bipartisan Background Checks Act that passed the Democratic-controlled House by a vote of 240-190 in February. The legislation, according to the Congressional Research Service, expands background check requirements by prohibiting a firearm transfer between unlicensed individuals \u201cunless a licensed gun dealer, manufacturer, or importer first takes possession of the firearm to conduct a background check.\u201d\n\nHowever, four other people on the debate stage \u2014 Sanders, Harris, Sen. Michael Bennet and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand \u2014 are all co-sponsors of the Background Check Expansion Act, which would \u201cexpand federal background checks to all gun sales,\u201d according to lawmakers who reintroduced the bill in January. (Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker, who were in the previous night\u2019s debate, are also co-sponsors.)\n\nBut because the Senate is currently controlled by Republicans, that bill has virtually no chance at passing in the chamber.\n\nAfter being asked about his concerns about \u201cembracing socialism,\u201d Hickenlooper misrepresented the Green New Deal, objecting to a provision in the legislation that doesn\u2019t exist.\n\n\u201cI admire the sense of urgency and how important it is to do climate change \u2014 I\u2019m a scientist,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we can\u2019t promise every American a government job.\u201d\n\nThe Green New Deal, which we\u2019ve written about before, is a nonbinding resolution that aims to tackle climate change while ensuring job security, health care and protecting vulnerable communities.\n\nThe Green New Deal doesn\u2019t promise every American a position in the government. Instead, it guarantees \u201ca job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations, and retirement security to all people of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe resolution was introduced into both chambers of Congress in February, and is most closely associated with New York freshman congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In March, the resolution did not advance in the Senate, after nearly all Democrats voted \u201cpresent.\u201d\n\nSanders claimed that Trump tried to \u201cthrow 32 million people off their health care that they have,\u201d a figure that includes people who would choose to no longer purchase insurance if Congress repealed the Affordable Care Act without replacing it. As we\u2019ve written before, it\u2019s misleading to say 32 million would all be thrown off.\n\nTrump supported a partial repeal-and-replace bill in the Republican-backed American Health Care Act, which wasn\u2019t expected to have as big of an impact on the uninsured. But he also backed an immediate repeal of the ACA, with a replacement at a \u201clater date.\u201d\n\nIn 2017 the Congressional Budget Office estimated the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act of 2017, a bill that would fit that description, would increase the number of uninsured by 32 million people over 10 years. But not all of them would be thrown off their insurance. CBO said: \u201cIn the nongroup market, some people would choose not to have insurance partly because they choose to be covered by insurance under current law to avoid paying the penalty.\u201d\n\nThe ACA imposed a tax penalty, known as the mandate, on those without health insurance, but the Republican tax law repealed that penalty as of Jan. 1 of this year. It\u2019s worth noting that in May 2018, the CBO revised downward its estimate of the impact of repealing the mandate.\n\nIn his closing statement, Sanders said he suspects \u201cpeople all over the country who are watching this debate are saying these are good people, they have great ideas, but how come nothing really changes?\u201d\n\nHe then posed several questions, including, \u201cHow come we have the highest rate of childhood poverty?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an unchanging \u2014 and false \u2014 Sanders claim. We debunked it twice during his 2016 presidential run.\n\nA 2017 report by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, or UNICEF, did note that the United States is above average when it comes to the \u201crelative child poverty\u201d rate \u2014 which \u201cshows the proportion of each nation\u2019s children living in a household where disposable income is less than 60% of the national median.\u201d\n\nBut the report did not indicate the U.S. had the \u201chighest\u201d rate. The country ranked No. 7 out of 41 rich countries, behind Romania, Israel, Turkey and others.\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau pegged the 2017 poverty rate for those under age 18 at 17.5 percent (see Table 3), which is the lowest it\u2019s been since 2006.\n\nThe bureau also calculates the Supplemental Poverty Measure, which accounts for government programs that assist low-income families and are not considered in the official poverty measure. The SPM rate for children in 2017 was 15.6 percent.\n\nUpdate, July 3: We amended our story to note that Sen. Kamala Harris began attending Thousand Oaks Elementary School, a public school in Berkeley, California, in 1970, according to her campaign. We previously reported, based on information from her Senate office, that she began there in 1969.\n\nMeyer, Peter J. \u201cU.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America: Policy Issues for Congress.\u201d Congressional Research Service. 12 Jun 2019.\n\nBrennan, Margaret and Grace Segers. \u201cTrump directs State Department to cut off aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.\u201d CBS News. 30 Mar 2019.\n\nLee, Matthew. \u201cUS restores some aid to El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala.\u201d The Associated Press. 18 Jun 2019.\n\nSmith, Allan and Doha Madani. \u201cBiden doubles down on segregationist comments, says critics like Cory Booker \u2018should apologize\u2019 to him.\u201d NBC News. 19 Jun 2019.\n\nU.S. Congress. \u201cJoseph Robinette Jr.\u201d Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress.
