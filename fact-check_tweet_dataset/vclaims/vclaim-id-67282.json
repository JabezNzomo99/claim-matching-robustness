To the average American, adapting the rules to make the Senate work again is just common sense. This is not about Democrats versus Republicans. This is about making Washington work \u2014 regardless of who is in the White House or who controls the Senate.\n\nAfter years of threats and retreats by both parties, the Democratic Senate majority on Nov. 21, 2013, called the \" .\"\n\nThe change eliminated the filibuster \u2014 a blockage of floor action, typically by the chamber\u2019s minority party \u2014 for executive branch nominations as well as judicial appointments short of the Supreme Court. Under the new rule, the Senate only needs a 51-vote majority instead of a 60-vote supermajority to end a filibuster and move to a final vote on a nomination.\n\nThe question of whether to change the rule has long divided the chamber\u2019s majority and its minority. In fact, supporting or opposing the \"nuclear option\" has been much more closely linked to a senator\u2019s position in the majority or the minority than whether they\u2019re a Republican or Democrat.\n\nThis means that both sides in this recent faceoff made different arguments than they had in previous iterations of the battle.\n\nThe rule change was introduced by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and was implemented with the support of all but a few Democrats and no Republicans. Yet Reid had strongly condemned the nuclear option when he was still in the minority. Time to take out the Flip-O-Meter!\n\nPolitiFact\u2019s Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on whether the change is justified or not. It simply looks at whether they did, indeed, change their stated position.\n\nWe\u2019ll take a look back to 2005, when the partisan lineup was substantially different. President George W. Bush had recently won a second term, while his fellow Republicans had a majority in the Senate. (The House was also controlled by Republicans, but the House isn\u2019t directly involved in the filibuster fight.)\n\nIn the Senate, the Democratic minority had filibustered a number of Bush\u2019s judicial appointments, displeasing Republicans, who seriously considered implementing the nuclear option that would allow them to confirm judges with a simple majority.\n\nThe effort drew the outrage of Democrats, among them then-Minority Leader Reid.\n\n\"You should not be able to come in here and change willy-nilly a rule of the Senate,\" Reid said on the Senate floor in May 2005.\n\nReid was afraid how a nuclear option could undermine the power of the Senate. \"What they are attempting to do in this instance is really too bad. It will change this body forever,\" he said. \"We will be an extension of the House of Representatives, where a simple majority there can determine everything.\"\n\nThe threat to go nuclear was eventually rescinded when a bipartisan group of senators \u2013 the \" \" \u2013 the effort. Seven Democrats agreed to no longer support their party\u2019s filibusters on judicial nominees, while seven Republicans promised not to vote with their colleagues to invoke the nuclear option.\n\nIn 2008, when Reid was already the Senate majority leader, he discussed the 2005 events in an . He continued to condemn the fact that the Republicans even contemplated using the nuclear option: \"The Senate was set up to be different, that was the genius, the vision of our Founding Fathers. \u2026 That's why you have the ability to filibuster, and to terminate filibuster. They wanted to get rid of all of that,\" Reid said.\n\nThen he was asked if he would ever consider invoking the nuclear option himself: \"As long as I am the leader, the answer\u2019s no,\" Reid promised. \"I think we should just forget that. That is a black chapter in the history of the Senate. I hope we never ever get to that again because I really do believe it will ruin our country.\"\n\nFast-forward to 2013. Now, Democrats held the White House and a Senate majority. The Republican minority had been by Obama, including of former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel for secretary of defense. Senate Democrats decided to go nuclear after the Senate GOP made clear that they had no intention of allowing three vacancies on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to be filled.\n\nAt that point, Senate Democrats took the opposite view they had taken in 2005. Led by Majority Leader Reid himself, they successfully invoked the nuclear option in a near-party-line vote, 52-48.\n\nBefore the vote, Reid explained his plan on the Senate floor: \"The Senate is a living thing, and to survive it must change, as it has over the history of this great country \u2026 This is not about Democrats versus Republicans. This is about making Washington work \u2014 regardless of who is in the White House or who controls the Senate,\" Reid said.\n\nThen he added: \"It is time to change the Senate before this institution becomes obsolete.\"\n\nIn 2005, Reid strongly condemned a proposed Senate rule change by the Republican majority. This week, with a Democratic majority, he proposed it himself. We rate this a Full Flop.", "lang": "en"}
