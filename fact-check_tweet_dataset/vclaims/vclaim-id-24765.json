The tweet comments that \u201cthey nearly doubled it from \u00a3950b to \u00a31.8tr\u201d. Both the Facebook post and the tweet were from 2 October. The Facebook post has been shared over 650 times and the tweet several thousand times.\n\nThe figures about the size of the UK\u2019s debt are roughly correct. It stands at \u00a31.8 trillion (81% of GDP) today compared to just over \u00a31 trillion (64% of GDP) in May 2010.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s no evidence that Mr Johnson actually said his party had wiped out the national debt.\n\nThe tweet was posted after Boris Johnson\u2019s speech at Conservative party conference last week. We also saw other very similar claims emerge on Twitter on the same day.\n\nThe supposed quote about having \u201cwiped out the national debt\u201d is not in the pre-released draft of Mr Johnson\u2019s conference speech. And we\u2019ve reviewed subtitles of the speech itself, using Full Fact\u2019s internal technology, which also show no mention of this claim.\n\nBoris Johnson did say \u201cit was this Conservative government that tackled the debt and the deficit left by the last Labour government\u201d. But this is not the same thing as saying the Conservatives have \u201cwiped out the national debt\u201d.\n\nIn theory it\u2019s possible that Mr Johnson made the claim somewhere other than during his keynote conference speech. But we\u2019ve seen no evidence for that either.\n\nThere are only a handful of tweets which report Mr Johnson as saying his party has \u201cwiped out the national debt\u201d, and none are from journalists who were at the conference.\n\nAdditionally, Googling the phrase \u201cwiped out the national debt\u201d returns the same few tweets and no evidence Mr Johnson has ever used those words. The quote has also been attributed to Mr Johnson in a Daily Express article, and we\u2019ve asked the Express to amend this.\n\nSince 2010 the debt has increased and the deficit has decreased\n\nAlthough the claim attributed to Mr Johnson seems to have been fabricated, it\u2019s worth examining what he did say in more detail.\n\nHe stated that \u201cit was this Conservative government that tackled the debt and the deficit\u201d. Government debt is the total amount of money the government owes from its borrowing over the years plus interest payments.\n\nThe deficit is effectively how much the government has borrowed each year.\n\nSince 2010/11 (when the Conservatives came back into office as part of the Coalition government) the deficit has fallen in all but one year, which in turn means that the national debt has continued to grow, but at a slower rate. Whether you consider this to mean the government has \u201ctackled the debt and deficit\u201d is a matter of interpretation.\n\nWe\u2019ve looked at the numbers is more detail here.", "lang": "en"}
