But experts say there is no credible research linking medications to mass shootings.\n\nThe unproven claim has different variants, but they share an assertion that the common thread among mass shooters is that the assailants were on psychotropic drugs, medication that is capable of affecting the mind or emotion.\n\nOne widely shared Facebook meme featured photos of some of the most notorious killers in recent memory, including the Charleston shooter Dylann Roof and Sandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza, along with a caption that reads: \"All of these mass shooters were on psychotropic drugs but I don\u2019t hear anyone calling for stronger prescription control.\"\n\nWe reached out to two experts who have studied the relationship between mass shootings and mental illness. They told us the claim has no scientific basis.\n\n\"I\u2019m not aware of any evidence that has demonstrated a credible connection \u2014 causal or otherwise \u2014 between psychiatric medication and mass violence,\" said Grant Duwe, research director for the Minnesota Department of Corrections. Duwe has authored a history of mass murder in the United States.\n\nMichael Rocque, a professor at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, added that one of the Facebook posts \u2014 which blames benzodiazepines for the July 28 shooting in Gilroy, Calif., at the annual Gilroy Garlic Festival \u2014 is particularly at odds with the evidence. Benzodiazepines are a class of drugs that has a tranquilizing effect.\n\n\"In fact there is some work showing benzodiazepines decreases violence,\" Rocque said.", "lang": "en"}
