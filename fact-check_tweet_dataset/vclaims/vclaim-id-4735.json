They were followed by Reagan, who won the state in 1980 and 1984.\n\nIn fact, during his speech at a campaign rally in Montana, Trump claimed incorrectly that Wisconsin was the only state that Reagan lost in his second election.\n\nAnd this wasn\u2019t the first time that Trump made the blunder. He said something similar during a speech in Wisconsin last week.\n\nTrump, June 28: You know, I just realized the other day, they told me \u2014 when we won the state of Wisconsin, it hadn\u2019t been won by a Republican since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952. Did you know that? And I won Wisconsin. And I like Wisconsin a lot, but we won Wisconsin. And Ronald Reagan \u2014 remember, Wisconsin was the state that Ronald Reagan did not win.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Reagan only lost one state during the 1984 election \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t Wisconsin. Reagan lost Minnesota to Democrat Walter Mondale, who was born in Minnesota and represented the state in the U.S. Senate.\n\nBefore Reagan\u2019s wins in 1980 and 1984, Nixon, another California Republican, carried Wisconsin in 1968 and 1972. Nixon also won there in 1960, though Democrat John F. Kennedy became president.\n\nThat means Trump\u2019s win in 2016 made him the third Republican to carry Wisconsin since Eisenhower did it in 1952 and again in 1956.", "lang": "en"}
