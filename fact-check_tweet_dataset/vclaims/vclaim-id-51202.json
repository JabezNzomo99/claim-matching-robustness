He endorsed Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney during their respective 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns, according to ABC News.\n\nThe image, which has been shared more than 6,200 times, alleges that Eastwood wrote a long statement praising Trump. \u201cI love him as our President,\u201d reads part of Eastwood\u2019s supposed statement. \u201cNo one is without fault. We hired a man to do a job. He has surpassed my expectations in record time, single handedly (sic) fighting the establishment.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no evidence that Eastwood ever said or wrote this long statement. The Daily Caller found no credible sources linking the statement to the \u201cMillion Dollar Baby\u201d actor, and Eastwood does not appear to have any social media accounts. (RELATED: Did Steve Harvey Author This Pro-Trump Statement?)\n\n\u201cThe statement\u2026 has been falsely attributed to our client Clint Eastwood,\u201d said Eastwood\u2019s lawyer, John Marks, in an email to the Caller. \u201cWe do not know if any other person genuinely made this statement, or if it has been manufactured, but in either case, it is not anything our client has stated or written.\u201d\n\nEastwood has made public statements about Trump in the past. During a 2016 Esquire magazine interview, he said that given a choice between Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, he would vote for Trump. Yet, while Eastwood appeared to express a preference for Trump in that interview, he has since also said that he \u201cstayed out of it\u201d and that both 2016 presidential candidates had a \u201ccertain degree of insanity.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
