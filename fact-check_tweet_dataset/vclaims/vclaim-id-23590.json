Show us that you got *****. Share this picture so much that this douche apologises for his words.\"\n\nThis is not the first time that the actor has been attributed with a false quote. In February this year, following a terror attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama, Khan had been in the centre of a viral fake post that quoted him as saying, \"If Pakistanis are boycotted, then I will leave the country.\" Read BOOM's debunk here.\n\nBOOM looked up for news reports about Khan\u2019s comment on leaving the country 'if Narendra Modi was voted back to power' and was directed to one year old Facebook posts. The posts were supported by a fake tweet and a fake news article. You can read the archived version of the news here.\n\nBelow are more examples of the same fake quote circulating in 2018.\n\nWe then ran an advanced search and were directed to reports which called out the now deleted tweet by a fake handle of Shah Rukh Khan. The tweet posted by @jamsrk reads, \"It is my challenge to entire world that if @narendramod ji will become next PM then I shall not leave only twitter but India also forever.\" It was posted on May 18, 2014.\n\nThe account has been inactive for sometime now, and has also deleted most of its tweets.\n\nKhan had clarified back in 2014 that the tweet in its entirety was fake.\n\nActor Kamaal R Khan, tweeted asking the genuineness of Khan\u2019s tweet too in 2014. However, he later deleted the Tweet and clarified that it was KRK himself who offered to leave the country, had PM Modi come to power.\n\nFurthermore, a host of now deleted posts also shared a news clipping from Sudarshan news, to establish that Khan had made such a statement. Though Sudarshan News' bulletin wasn't traceable independently by BOOM, we found a screen grab of the same.\n\nThe same message was viral last year. It was debunked by BOOM's Hindi website.", "lang": "en"}
