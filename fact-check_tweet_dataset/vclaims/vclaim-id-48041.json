The stated aim of Turkey was to create a 30-kilometer buffer zone in the north of the country, pushing out the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), led by the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD), which Turkey considers to be part of the Kurdish Workers\u2019 Party (PKK). The PKK is officially recognized as a terrorist group in Turkey and has also been so recognized by a number of other countries including the U.S. The PYD, along with its armed wing the YPG/YPJ, were founded by the PKK and they express support for the jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan. The U.S. intelligence community, in its 2018 and 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessments, described the PYD\u2019s armed wing as the PKK\u2019s militia force in Syria. However, there is debate as to the level of operational involvement the YPG/YPJ have with PKK activities in Turkey.\n\nIn an interview with the Turkish state-owned Anadolu Agency, the head of the Turkish Parliament\u2019s Foreign Affairs Committee Volkan Bozkir said that Turkey\u2019s objective in Syria was to \u201censure our border security\u201d and \u201cneutralize terrorists.\u201d He accused the Kurdish PYD of \u201coppression and cruelty\u201d toward the people living in their territory.\n\nWhile the PYD has certainly been credibly accused of human rights abuses, Bozkir spoke of their \u201coppression and cruelty\u201d and even compared their activity with the terrorists of the Islamic State (IS).While Human Rights Watch details \u201ca range of human rights abuses\u201d by the PYD, it also states some of the abuses by the Syrian government and \u201cnon-state actors\u201d in the country \u201camount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.\u201d\n\nMoreover, if Turkey\u2019s aim is \u201cneutralizing terrorists\u201d as Bozkir claims, the invasion appears to be having the opposite effect. For months the SDF had warned about the burden they faced in housing thousands of Islamic State prisoners, both fighters and their family members. In order to relieve that burden, they asked European countries to take back the foreign fighters that were their citizens. Many of those countries either refused to take back their citizens, or preferred to decide repatriation on a case-by-case basis, leaving many still in captivity in Syria. With the Turkish invasion, the poorly-equipped, thinly stretched SDF forces have lost the ability to control their prisoners and there have been multiple reports of IS escapes and in the few days following the start of the operation.\n\nBozkir is also quoted as saying:\n\n\"Turkey does not seek conflict with the Kurdish people. Kurds make up a significant portion of the Turkish population. They serve in our military, in our Parliament, they are business leaders in Turkey. In addition, Turkey has no ambition to occupy northeastern Syria. We remain committed to the territorial integrity of Syria. Turkey also has no interest in changing the demographics of the region, as some have alleged.\"\n\nThis statement lacks critical context. First, while the SDF was founded and led by the Kurdish PYD, it was never entirely Kurdish in composition. Other ethnic groups, mainly Arabs but also Assyrians, Armenians, and Turkmen also fought with the group. Moreover, Turkey has vowed to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d within northern Syria, and thus it not entirely clear how Turkey will ensure that safety without an ongoing occupation. European Union leaders have said the EU will not pay for a safe zone.\n\nOn the topic of changing demographics in the region, Bozkir spoke in his interview of making a safe zone for the voluntary return and resettlement of Syrian refugees, 3.6 million of which are currently living within Turkey according to him. Even if they go voluntarily to the new territory, their arrival could fit one of several definitions of ethnic cleansing if Turkey is replacing the current residents, especially Kurdish ones. According to the United Nations, ethnic cleansing may include \u201ca purposeful policy designed by one ethnic or religious group to remove by violent and terror-inspiring means the civilian population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas.\u201d Fears of ethnic cleansing may be raised further by reports that Turkey\u2019s Syrian allies in the current operation have killed SDF fighters who surrendered.\n\nAs for claims about Kurds being citizens of Turkey, serving in the army, etc., it should be noted that the protection of Kurdish civil rights, including the right to use their language in public life, is a relatively recent development in Turkey, and Kurds are still prevented from fully participating in Turkish politics.\n\n\u201cThe government continued its repressive measures against elected parliamentarians, mayors and municipalities from pro-Kurdish parties, although the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (HDP) secured 67 parliamentary seats (11.9 percent of the vote) in the June election,\u201d Human Rights Watch noted in a 2019 report on Turkey.\n\n\u201cIn the southeast, the suspension of local democracy continued as the government maintained control of 94 municipalities won in the 2014 local elections by the HDP\u2019s sister party, the Democratic Regions Party (DBP). At time of writing, 50 co-mayors remained jailed on politically motivated terrorism charges after their removal from elected office and the assignment of government appointees to their positions,\u201d HRW added.", "lang": "en"}
