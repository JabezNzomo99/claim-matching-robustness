The Quint got in touch with the Amravati police and they confirmed to us that the video was shot during a mock drill and it doesn\u2019t show the police arresting RSS men.\n\nA different version of the same video had gone viral earlier, which claimed that the police arrested these terrorists from Ambadevi Temple. The Quint had earlier debunked that viral story too.", "lang": "en"}
