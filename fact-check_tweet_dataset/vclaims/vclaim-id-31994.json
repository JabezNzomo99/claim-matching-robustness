The message too is the same as the one recorded for Modi.\n\nWe found the original video by Brut India from their official twitter account on February 20, 2019, where she can be heard addressing her message to Modi.\n\nShe can be heard saying the following:\n\n\"Dear Mr Modi, you need to take action now against the climate crisis, not just talking about it because if you keep on going like this, doing business as usual, and just talking about and barging about the little victories, you are going to fail. And if you fail you're going to be seen as one of the worst villains in human history in the future. And you don't want that.\" - Greta Thunberg\n\nBOOM also contacted Sruthi Gottipati, Editor-in-Chief, Brut India who via email said, \"One of our staff reporters shot that video in Stockholm, on February 15, 2019, as was clearly noted in the video footage itself.\" Gottipati further added, \"Our journalist asked Thunberg the question: \"What is your message to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi?\" She had the same message for the leaders of France, the US and the UK.\"\n\nWhile both the videos were shot on February 15, 2019, Thunberg's address to Modi was published by Brut on February 19, 2019, and her message for the French president was published on February 18, 2019, on Facebook.", "lang": "en"}
