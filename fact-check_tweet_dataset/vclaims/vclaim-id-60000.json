Hurricane Hanna made landfall in southern Texas in late July.\n\nHurricane Hanna, the first of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, made landfall on the Texas Gulf Coast July 25, inflicting heavy rains, flooding and damaging winds, USA Today reported.\n\nThe video being shared shows a barrier being buffeted by heavy wind and eventually collapsing. In the caption, the Facebook user alleges that the video depicts Hurricane Hanna blowing over \u201cpart of a Border Wall on the border with US-Mexico\u201d in Texas.\n\nThat is, however, not what the video shows. When reached for comment, U.S. Customs and Border Protection directed the Daily Caller to a statement regarding the video on the agency\u2019s website. It states that the video \u201cappears to be from June 2020.\u201d\n\n\u201cU.S. Customs and Border Protection is not aware of any border wall panels falling over due to Hurricane Hanna hitting the Rio Grande Valley Sector this past weekend,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThe video circulating on social media appears to be from June 2020 when high winds caused several border wall panels that were pending additional anchoring to fall over at a construction site near Deming, New Mexico.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), which is overseeing the ongoing wall construction south of Deming, also confirmed that the video is \u201ccompletely unrelated to Hurricane Hanna.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe incident involving the unexpected high wind gust, which knocked over the barrier panels in the video which were in the process of being fully anchored,\u201d George Jozens, a USACE public affairs officer, said in an email to the Caller. \u201cIt occurred on June 5th at the El Paso 2, Segment 3 project.\u201d\n\nJozens said that the contractor has \u201crevised its barrier panel-bracing procedures\u201d and that construction \u201chas continued on the project without further incident.\u201d (RELATED: Was A \u2018Huge Percentage\u2019 Of Deported Salvadorans Killed Or Harmed Upon Return To El Salvador?)\n\nHurricane Hanna dissipated over northeastern Mexico on July 27, according to Yale Climate Connections.", "lang": "en"}
