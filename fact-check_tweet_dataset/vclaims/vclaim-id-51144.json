This is a piece of modern art created by the Rag N Bone Emporium, an Etsy shop that specializes in macabre items. When the above-displayed photograph was shared to Rag N Bone Emporium\u2019s Deviant Art page in April 2013, it was accompanied by the tags \u201cVisual Art,\u201d \u201cOriginal Work,\u201d and \u201cArtisan Crafts.\u201d\n\nThe Rag N Bone Emporium creates crafts that appear to have ancient or even mystical origins, such as this \u201cvampire fang necklace charm,\u201d this \u201cwerewolf claw,\u201d or this piece of \u201cbigfoot hair.\u201d The Rag N Bone Emporium\u2019s Etsy shop and social media pages also contain images of several other \u201cvampire killing kits.\u201d\n\nThe above-displayed photograph shows an item created in 2013, not the early 19th century, but this isn\u2019t the only photograph supposedly showing a \u201cvampire hunting kit\u201d on the internet. While we can\u2019t speak to every one of these images, we can say that many of these kits first appeared in the 1970s as entrepreneurs attempted to capitalize on a wave of vampire movies and television shows.\n\nSome of these kits ended up fetching big prices at auction. A few even ended up in museums. However, historians have found that while these kits are often presented as if they were made in the early 19th century, they have almost always turned out to be modern creations. A kit may contain one or two older artifacts, but as a general rule, these images don\u2019t show genuine \u201cvampire hunting kits\u201d that were built, sold, and used to hunt what were believed to be vampires in the 1800s.\n\nFor example, the Royal Armories Museum in England had a vampire kit on display that contained a few older items, such as a pistol from the 1850s, but the kit was a \u201cnovelty item,\u201d and nothing of its description existed prior to the 1970s:\n\nThis is one of over 100 so-called vampire killing kits extant (as of 2016), thought to have originated as novelty items in Britain, c1970, though the first written evidence is from the United States (1986) and most examples are sold there. There is no evidence to suggest that anything like them existed prior to this date, significant as the heyday of \u2018Hammer\u2019 horror movies. The kit was loaned and exhibited as part of the 2014/15 British Library exhibition \u2018Terror and Wonder: The Gothic Imagination\u2019.\n\nIn a follow-up article, the Royal Armories stated that these vampire kits were \u201cinspired by the movies, not Victorian stories and folklore,\u201d and that these kits could not have predated the \u201cHammer\u201d horror films, a series of movies produced by Hammer Films, including \u201cThe Curse of Frankenstein,\u201d \u201cDracula,\u201d and \u201cThe Mummy,\u201d starting in the mid-1950s.", "lang": "en"}
