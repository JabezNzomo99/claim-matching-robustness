No, that's not true: the study was made up by a right-wing satire website. It does not exist.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by NPC Daily on January 27, 2019 titled \"New study says women prefer low testosterone effeminate liberal men to muscular confident alpha males - NPC Daily\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nAccording to a poll data received from 48,000 individuals of various gender identities at the 2019 women's march, it's abundantly clear that muscular confident alpha males are out, and low testosterone effeminate liberal beta males are in. Especially with the advent of the latest Gillette ad, toxic masculinity is at an all time low and women are preferring men with less characteristically \"masculine\" traits. If you are a man (or identify as one) and you have successfully developed your fitness level to the point where your body fat is low while muscle composition is high, you have abs, a sculpted chest, and can bench twice your body weight - we're sorry to say you wasted your time. If you want any of the strong attractive women from the women's march, you need to switch up your priorities. Women love men who barely qualify as traditional men. We're talking thin men with skinny fat, untoned muscles, patchy facial hair, poor eyesight and liberal views so far to the left, that every possession they have is yours too. Low testosterone and a high soy-based diet is in.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail so they would not initially have seen this was a satire site:\n\nThe article offers no source for this study and does not mention who undertook it or where the results are published. But the NPC Daily has an about page which says:\n\nNPC Daily is a satire site, providing political and cultural commentary with wanton sarcasm. NPC Daily pokes fun of modern journalism and liberalism. If you believe one of our articles is real, it's because the content is not too far adrift from what is published by mainstream news outlets. But, alas, our content is totally fictitious and is created to elicit laughs and bemusement. NPC Daily doesn't support physical or verbal attacks against anyone for any reason. We can assume no responsibility for anyone's feelings or thoughts. We are blessed to live in a country that allows free speech, with laws that specifically shield humor from defamation and liable lawsuits. If you feel the need to complain about our content, we suggest you talk to your mother or a women's study professor. If content might trigger negative emotions or if you choose to take offense, we recommend you exit the site and do not further consume the award-winning humor created by our authors, who have been specially trained in long-form sarcasm.\n\nThe name of the site is likely a play on the NPC meme often used in certain right-wing circles to depict political opponents as mindless people who have fallen victim to groupthink and conformity.", "lang": "en"}
