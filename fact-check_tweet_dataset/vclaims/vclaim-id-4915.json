But the numbers he used were often misleading or just plain wrong. As a reader service, we looked into six claims the president just couldn\u2019t and hasn\u2019t stopped repeating.\n\nIn a Wall Street Journal op-ed, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg wrote, \u201cThe upswing in NATO defense spending over the past year and a half demonstrates that [President Trump\u2019s] efforts are making a difference.\u201d Yet, they don\u2019t match the president\u2019s boasts of success. Member countries have been spending more on their defense since 2014. Excluding the U.S., members have collectively increased defense spending by $11.4 billion over the past year, when adjusted for inflation and using 2010 prices and exchange rates. (Trump could be referencing the same calculation in today\u2019s dollars, which comes to $34 billion.)\n\nAs for being \u201cricher than it ever was,\u201d it\u2019s not entirely clear what Trump means, but given the context, let\u2019s assume he meant the amount member countries have spent on defense over time. That claim falls flat pretty quickly. As recently as 2011, using 2010 prices and exchange rates, NATO members spent more than they do today. At the height of the Cold War, between 1980-1984, they spent 4.5 percent of their collective GDP on defense. Today, it\u2019s 2.4 percent.\n\nTrump\u2019s right \u2014 five of the 29 NATO member states do currently spend at least 2 percent of their GDP on defense \u2014 the United States, Greece, Estonia, the United Kingdom and Latvia. And according to current NATO projections, three more \u2014 Poland, Lithuania and Romania \u2014 are expected to meet this guideline by the end of the year. Regardless, Trump is neglecting the fact that the deadline is still six years away and Stoltenberg wrote, \u201ca majority of allies have plans to meet their 2 percent commitment\u201d in time.\n\nEach NATO member has had this 2 percent spending guideline since 2006, but not everyone had been actively working toward that. But after the 2014 annexation of Crimea, NATO members pledged to stop cutting their defense expenditure and \u201cmove toward\u201d that 2 percent guideline within 10 years. In other words, the commitment to 2 percent was made in 2014.\n\nMember states did \u201creaffirm [their] unwavering commitment\u201d to the 2 percent pledge at this year\u2019s summit, but the official declaration made no mention of additional increases. When asked about Trump\u2019s claim French President Emmanuel Macron said, \u201cThere is a communique that was published yesterday. It\u2019s very detailed. It confirms the goal of 2 percent by 2024. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nTrump is equating the strength of the alliance to all member countries reaching the 2 percent benchmark. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau argued the opposite \u2014 that spending doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to being productive member of NATO. Even though Canadian defense spending is estimated to only hit 1.23 percent of GDP, Trudeau pointed to the invaluable role Canadian troops play leading NATO missions. Defense experts Richard Sokolsky and Gordon Adams have noted, Greece met the guideline, even though it has slashed defense spending, because its economy collapsed. \u201cMeasuring what the allies spend on defense as a share of their economies tells us nothing about the capabilities they are buying,\u201d they wrote for the War on the Rocks website.\n\nIt seems Trump still doesn\u2019t understand how NATO funding works. (We\u2019ve spelled this out multiple times before.) Daniel Fried, former assistant secretary of state for Europe, told the Fact Checker via email, \u201cThe notion that the allies owe the U.S. back dues\u201d is wrong. Former deputy secretary general of NATO, Alexander Vershbow, said, \u201cThere are no arrears owed to the U.S. or NATO. President Trump is under the delusion that Allies pay the U.S. for protection, or is feigning ignorance on how NATO works.\u201d\n\nMember countries fund NATO directly and indirectly. The majority of NATO funds are indirect. \u201cNATO isn\u2019t a private club like Mar-a-Lago\u201d where countries owe dues, Derek Chollet, a former U.S. assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, pointed out. If a country meets the 2 percent guideline, it is spending at least 2 percent of GDP on its own defense \u2014 not picking up another country\u2019s tab.\n\nDirect contributions to finance the collective costs of running NATO headquarters, integrated command structure and some joint military capabilities, but those contributions are based on Gross National Income and according to NATO, \u201crepresent a small percentage of each member\u2019s defense budget.\u201d (In the past, the U.S. contribution equated to amounts less than $500 million per year \u2014 essentially, a rounding error in the defense budget.)\n\nIt\u2019s more likely he\u2019s talking about indirect funding. Member countries collectively spent $917 billion on defense in 2017. The United States spent $618 billion, according to a NATO report. In other words, U.S. defense spending accounted for 67 percent of all defense spending by members of the alliance. \u201cThis does not mean that the United States covers 67 percent of the costs involved in the operational running of NATO as an organization, including its headquarters in Brussels and its subordinate military commands,\u201d NATO\u2019s website said, \u201cBut it does mean that there is an over-reliance by the Alliance as a whole on the United States for the provision of essential capabilities.\u201d\n\nStill Trump is missing the point. These are funds the U.S. has authorized to spend on its own defense. They are not the \u201ccost of NATO.\u201d Vershbow notes, \u201cMore than half of this is for defense activities in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East/Gulf, Africa and the Americas.\u201d\n\nGerman defense spending accounted for 1.2 percent of GDP. The U.S. spent 3.5 percent of GDP \u2014 not 4.2. But as we explained the ratio of defense spending isn\u2019t all that matters. Let\u2019s put it this way. If Germany chose to give its military a raise, Chollet pointed out, it would easily cross this 2 percent threshold. But that wouldn\u2019t benefit the alliance in the same way that housing Ramstein Air Force Base does.", "lang": "en"}
