For those offended by my \"communist\" comment, I'll send a therapy dog to your \"safe place\" of choice in Madison.\n\nAnd the next day, Pocan went on Carlson\u2019s show to talk about the spat some more.\n\nPerhaps lost in the back-and-forth was Duffy\u2019s claim about the recount -- that Dane is the only county in Wisconsin recounting ballots by hand.\n\nStein raised millions of dollars over the Thanksgiving holiday to pay for presidential election recounts in Wisconsin and two other states. She also said Wisconsin uses illegal voting machines, which we rated Pants on Fire.\n\nWe noted in that item that the vast majority of voting machines in Wisconsin are optical readers. Voters fill out a paper ballot and feed it into the machine, which then electronically records the vote. Meanwhile, a small percentage of votes are cast on touch-screen machines -- but in Wisconsin they also generate a paper record for each ballot cast.\n\nAs of early afternoon on Dec. 9, 2016, with the recount expected to be completed within two or three days, 88.5 percent of the Wisconsin votes had been recounted.\n\nClinton had gained 49 votes on Republican Donald Trump, who won the state by some 22,000 votes in the original count. All told, there was a net change of 1,322 votes in the presidential race among the more than 2.63 million ballots that had been recounted.\n\nAs for how the recounting has been done, the majority of Wisconsin\u2019s 72 counties (including Dane, but not Milwaukee) are doing it by hand.\n\nHere is what the county election clerks told the Wisconsin Election Commission at the outset of the recount about their plans for the recount:\n\n47 counties: Recount by hand\n\n 13 counties: Combination of hand count and optical scanners\n\n 12 counties: Optical scanners\n\nA word on the process in Wisconsin:\n\u2022 Every ballot is first examined by the recount workers so the candidates\u2019 representatives can see it and raise any questions or objections to it.\n\u2022 If the recount is conducted by hand, the ballots are sorted into piles for each candidate for counting by hand.\n\u2022 If the recount is by machine, the ballots are fed into the tabulating machine for counting.\n\nThe commission told us it did not follow up with the clerks to see if any of their plans had changed.\n\nBut there were news reports about hand counts being done in various counties, including Brown, Clark and Marinette.\n\nIn any case, Duffy was not claiming that Dane was the only county doing hand recounts, according to Duffy spokesman Mark Bednar.\n\nDuffy \"was explaining that Dane County was the only county where there were reports on the ground of Stein supporters trying to slow-walk the recount process,\" Bednar said.\n\nBut that\u2019s not how it came out in the interview.\n\nDuffy declared that only Dane County was hand counting votes. But many counties decided to do the recount by hand.\n\nThe \"slow walking\" part of what Duffy said has to do with Stein and Clinton supporters and nothing to do with Dane County.\n\nDuffy said Wisconsin has only one county, Dane, \"that's hand counting the votes\" in the 2016 presidential recount.\n\nBut several dozen counties committed to doing recounts by hand, Dane being one of them.\n\nWe rate the claim Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
