However, such a possibility remains unlikely during the presidency of Donald Trump, who has previously expressed that he is an \u201cabsolute no\u201d on Puerto Rican statehood.\n\nAs The Washington Post observed, Trump has long been feuding with that territory\u2019s government officials, whom he has branded as \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cincompetent\u201d:\n\nPresident Trump lashed out at Puerto Rico and its politicians, calling the U.S. territory \u201cone of the most corrupt places on earth\u201d as it braced for the arrival of Tropical Storm Dorian with near-hurricane force. \u201cTheir political system is broken and their politicians are either Incompetent or Corrupt,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cCongress approved Billions of Dollars last time, more than anyplace else has ever gotten, and it is sent to Crooked Pols. No good!\u201d Trump continued a feud with San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz Soto, deriding the leader of the island\u2019s largest city as \u201cincompetent\u201d in a morning tweet. \u201cWe are tracking closely tropical storm Dorian as it heads, as usual, to Puerto Rico,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cFEMA and all others are ready, and will do a great job. When they do, let them know it, and give them a big Thank You \u2014 Not like last time. That includes from the incompetent Mayor of San Juan!\u201d\n\nThese events led to the circulation of a purported tweet from Trump in which he excoriated Governor V\u00e1zquez as \u201cincompetent,\u201d and disparaged Puerto Rico as \u201ca small island filled with savages,\u201d adding that \u201cThere are more chances of me moving to North Korea than Puerto Rico becoming a state\u201d:\n\nThis was not an authentic Trump tweet, however: It does not appear in the timeline of his Twitter account, nor was it recorded by any of the several databases that preserve deleted tweets. And if there were any lingering doubts, the watermark for the satirical \u201cPuerto Rico Departamento de Memes\u201d visible on the tweet image should be a giveaway.", "lang": "en"}
