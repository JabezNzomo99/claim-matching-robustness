See what happened when they reported\u2026\u201d is a message widely circulating on social media along with a video that shows a man brutally thrashing two women. Twitter user @shukla28 who describes himself as a BJP supporter was among those who shared the clip drawing 50,000 views. Another user who identifies as a PM Modi supporter retweeted @shukla28\u2018s tweet. Both tweets now stand deleted. However, several other users have shared it.\n\nSeveral people have used to video to make a case in favour of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The complete message reads, \u201cIn Pakistan\u2019s Punjab, Muslim youth is torturing Hindu sister. You will be shocked that her only fault was that the Hindu sister went to the police station to report the torture. Modi ji is bringing in CAA for the safety of these sisters.\u201d\n\nThe video is viral on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nAlt News broke the video into multiple keyframes and reverse-searched one of these on Yandex. This led us to a report by Gujarati media outlet Divya Bhaskarpublished on August 30, 2018. According to the article, the video was shot in Rajouri, Jammu and Kashmir. Based on these clues, we performed a keyword search on YouTube and were redirected to a June 21, 2018 video report by HW News. The broadcast includes a statement by Rajouri SSP Yugam Manhas who said that a mother-daughter duo was thrashed by a neighbour for an old dispute. The accused was a driver by profession and fled after the alleged crime. The police however, caught him in a village in Kathua.\n\nJ&K police had tweeted about the incident on June 21, 2018, and provided information of the arrest.\n\nTherefore, a nearly two-year-old video of women thrashed in Jammu and Kashmir is viral with the false claim that it depicts mistreatment of Hindus in Pakistan. The video is circulating in the backdrop of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) that seeks to provide Indian citizenship to non-Muslim minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.\n\n[This article was updated on February 13, 2020, to include the latest tweets. The title of the report has also been rectified from Kashmir to \u2018J&K\u2019.]", "lang": "en"}
