Facebook users reported the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to curb fake news.\n\nThe post accused San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz of deliberately withholding relief supplies from residents following Hurricane Maria, citing a Sept. 28 New York Post article about logistical problems in Puerto Rico. San Juan\u2019s city council decided in an emergency meeting that they would begin impeachment proceedings, the anews-24.com post said.\n\nCruz made headlines for blasting President Donald Trump\u2019s response to Hurricane Maria, with Trump responding in kind on Twitter.\n\nBut she isn\u2019t being impeached by anyone, because the article, which is fake, came from a site that parodies real news. It first appeared on the website AsAmericanAsApplePie.org on Oct. 12.\n\nAsAmericanAsApplePie.org has all the hallmarks of a series of fake websites associated with Christopher Blair, a self-described liberal troll who creates fictional stories to try to fool conservative readers.\n\nWe\u2019ve fact-checked plenty of stories that originated from websites run by or affiliated with Blair, including TheLastLineOfDefense.org, FreedomCrossroad.us, OurLandOfTheFree.com and FreedomJunkshun.com.\n\nAsAmericanAsApplePie.org uses the same website architecture as these other sites, and carries a disclaimer that reads, \"As American as Apple Pie is here to be your beacon of something you can kinda rely on sometimes but not really.\"\n\nThe impeachment proceedings against Cruz are made up.
