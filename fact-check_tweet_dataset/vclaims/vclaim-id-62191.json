Facebook users shared the video claiming it shows flash flooding in West Pokot, a county in western Kenya.\n\nHowever, the scene depicted in the video didn\u2019t occur in Kenya. The Mexican newspaper Zocalo published the footage on its website in late July, stating that it happened in the Mexican state of Nayarit. Other media outlets reported that the flooding occurred after a river in Mexico overflowed due to Hurricane Hanna, the first storm of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nHanna inflicted heavy rains, flooding and damaging winds in northern Mexico and southern Texas after making landfall on July 25, CBS News reported. The storm dissipated over northeastern Mexico on July 27, according to Yale Climate Connections.
