He does not have a public Twitter account.\n\nFreeman, an award-winning actor with a career spanning more than 5 decades, is known for starring in such films as \u201cDriving Miss Daisy\u201d and \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption.\u201d From 2010 to 2017, he also hosted the space documentary series \u201cThrough the Wormhole.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no record of him ever making the statement attributed to him in the screen grabbed tweet. Freeman does not have a verified Twitter account, and no similar statements appear on his official Facebook page. The Daily Caller found no interview or movie in which he said this either.\n\nAn internet search revealed that the statement has been circulating online since at least 2015. It\u2019s unclear how it first became linked to Freeman.

The event, which has spread to more than 180 countries, calls for greater awareness and more sparing use of natural resources to help the environment.", "lang": "en"}
