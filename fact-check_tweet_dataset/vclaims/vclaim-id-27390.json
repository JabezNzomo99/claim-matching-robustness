While no customs export declaration forms would be required (as Northern Ireland will remain in a UK-wide customs area), exit summary declarations will be required to move goods between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. These declarations represent a new intervention, in addition to existing checks.\n\nDoes Brexit deal mean no forms to access Great Britain?\n\nIn a tweet published by Manufacturing NI on 8 November 2019, Irwin Armstrong (a former Conservatives NI chair and candidate, and founder of CIGA Healthcare, with headquarters in Ballymena, Northern Ireland) asked Prime Minister Boris Johnston: \u201cCan I go back to my company \u2026 and tell my staff that we will not be filling in any customs declarations for goods leaving Northern Ireland to go to (Great Britain)?\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Johnston replied: \u201cYou can \u2026 If somebody asks you to do that [fill in a customs declaration form], tell them to ring up the Prime Minister, and I will direct them to throw that form in the bin.\u201d\n\nMr Armstrong then replied, \u201cBecause Steve Barclay [MP; Secretary of State, Exiting the European Union] said we would [have to fill in a customs declaration form].\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Johnston replied further: \u201cNo \u2026 There will be no forms, no checks, no barriers of any kind. You will have unfettered access.\u201d\n\nWhat did Steve Barclay say?\n\nOn 21 October 2019, at a meeting of the House of Lord\u2019s European Union Select Committee, Lord (Stewart) Wood asked Stephen Barclay MP: \u201cWill Northern Ireland businesses that trade with Great Britain have to complete export declarations?\u201d\n\nBarclay answered, \u201cFrom Northern Ireland to Great Britain? No, because we\u2019ve said in terms of, from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, that it will be frictionless. And so there wouldn\u2019t be export\u2026\u201d\n\nLord (Stewart) Wood: \u201cEven though the EU customs code says that when goods leave, they do have to complete these declarations?\u201d\n\nStephen Barclay: \u201cI would have to come back and write to you on that. My recollection was that there weren\u2019t requirements coming from Northern Ireland to Great Britain on that, but I\u2019m not sure.\u201d A few minutes later he clarified himself: \u201cJust to be clear, the exit summary declarations will be required in terms of Northern Ireland to Great Britain.\u201d\n\nWhat is the difference between a customs declaration and an exit summary declaration?\n\nAs summarised by the Tax Authorities of the Netherlands, before goods leave the European Union\u2019s customs territory, you must submit a \u201cpre-departure declaration\u201d, in one of three types:\n\nIf the UK leaves the EU under the current agreement, and Northern Ireland remains as an integral part of the UK and thus its single customs territory (i.e. not part of the EU customs territory), there would be no question of Northern Ireland persons (individuals and businesses) having to complete an EU customs declaration/export declaration of bringing goods originating in Northern Ireland across to Great Britain.\n\nIn this regard, both Prime Minister Boris Johnson MP and Stephen Barclay MP are correct in their statements that there would be no customs declaration or export declarations for Northern Ireland businesses trading with Great Britain.\n\nBut trading does not cover the act of merely moving goods across the UK.\n\nPost UK departure from the EU, there is the issue of a boundary on the island of Ireland between a member state (UK) and non-member state (Ireland). The EU will treat this as an economic border, and therefore will want to keep track of goods across it. As a compromise, the current UK-EU agreement allows Northern Ireland to retain access to the EU single market, but Northern Ireland businesses will have to comply with the EU\u2019s custom code by completing an EU exit summary declaration when they move goods into Great Britain.\n\nEffectively, the EU is treating Northern Ireland as if it is in the EU customs territory (de facto), but the EU cannot compel Northern Ireland companies to comply with customs declarations/export declarations (because Northern Ireland will remain within the UK\u2019s custom area, de jure). Exit summary declarations are the compromise for Northern Ireland\u2019s access to the EU single market.\n\nNonetheless, having to complete exit summary declarations is a new requirement, as an outcome of the current agreement. It is not accurate to say that there will be no forms, checks, or barriers of any kind for goods leaving Northern Ireland to Great Britain.\n\nImage: Photo by Steve6326 used by license Dreamstime.com\n\nFactCheckNI is Northern Ireland\u2019s first and only dedicated independent fact-checking service and a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network\u2019s Code of Principles.
