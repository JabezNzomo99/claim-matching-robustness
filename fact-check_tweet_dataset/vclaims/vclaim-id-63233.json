If you are well off spend this for the service and help of the needy.lesson for humanity.\" \n\n\n\nRelevant keyword searches on Facebook and Twitter revealed that these images are viral with similar narratives on both the platforms as well.\n\nBOOM did a reverse image search of one of the images, which led us to an article by a local Venezuelan news outlet called Maduradas, published on March 12, 2019. The article spoke of hooded vandals ransacking a bank in the Venezuelan town of Merida, and scattering old currency notes which were demonetised in 2018. It also contained a series of images showing streets of M\u00e9rida littered with old notes, including the images going viral as Italy.\n\nHere is an excerpt from the article:\n\nTERRIBLE! Hooded vandals ransacked the Bicentennial bank in M\u00e9rida and scattered bolivars of the old currency through the streets (+ Photos) This Monday, March 11, hooded vandals ransacked the Bicentennial bank agency on Avenida 3, Glorias Patrias, in the state of M\u00e9rida. The fact was confirmed by the deputy of the National Assembly Williams D\u00e1vila, as well as by the correspondent of El Nacional in the state of M\u00e9rida, Leonardo Le\u00f3n. Through the social network Twitter, they reported that citizens scattered piles of old currency bills in the streets, which were later burned down.\n\nTowards the beginning of 2018, the Venezuelan economy faced hyperinflation which greatly devalued the old currency - bolivar fuerte. In August 2018, the Maduro government decided to demonetise the old currency and introduce a new one - the bolivar soberano, as explained by this CNN report.\n\nOut of the 180 countries affected by COVID-19, Italy currently has the highest death toll at 12,428. However, their currency Euro still remains one of the most valuable currencies in the world. Therefore it is unlikely that people will discard huge amounts of it in the streets.\n\nThese images had previously gone viral as Venezuelans throwing away their existing currency, which was then debunked by Snopes.", "lang": "en"}
