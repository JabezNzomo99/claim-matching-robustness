The image, however, has been manipulated. The stone signage it captures is the foundation\u2019s Discovery Center in Seattle, which is not home to a depopulation effort, nor are the Microsoft co-founder and his wife behind any such initiative.\n\n\n\nBill Gates has been a leading voice on the push for a vaccine to combat COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, pledging $50 million as part of broader funding that has made him a target of anti-vaccine campaigners.\n\nPosts sharing the altered photo on Facebook and Twitter, seek to disparage the tech billionaire.\n\n\u201cPlease could you explain what is this,\u201d a tweet that includes the photo said, in response to a video posted on May 1, 2020 on Bill Gates\u2019s Twitter account about the progress made to find a vaccine to tackle COVID-19 infections that have swept the globe since first emerging in Wuhan, China in late 2019.\n\n\u201cIn case you ever doubted what outcome Bill #Gates planned/plans with his artificial forms of #eugenics\u2026,\u201d a Facebook user wrote in a post shared more than 600 times.\n\nEugenics -- the study of human population control and manipulation of genetic characteristics -- is commonly cited by the anti-vaccine movement as the goal of those who favor vaccination.\n\nA reverse image search shows that signage at the Discovery Center, located at 500 5th Avenue N, in Seattle, Washington, has no writing other than the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation name.\n\nThe center hosts exhibits about the foundation\u2019s mission, and how science and technology can fight inequalities, poverty and diseases. The purported \u201cCenter For Global Human Population Reduction\u201d has been falsely added.\n\nA look at the building through different angles on Google Street View confirmed that the location displayed above matches that of the photo shared on social media.\n\nMultiple conspiracy theories concerning Bill Gates and the novel coronavirus have emerged since the beginning of the pandemic. Posts about a letter said to have been written by the billionaire were debunked by AFP fact checkers in Hong Kong, and warnings about a \u201cBill Gates vaccine,\u201d were proven by AFP Ethiopia to be false, given there is no such treatment.", "lang": "en"}
