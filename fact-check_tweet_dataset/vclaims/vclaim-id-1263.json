This is incorrect.\n\nThe post ( here ), with 178 shares as of July 22, shows an image of police officers attending a protest in London in Hyde Park. The image contains the caption: \u201cDuring this scamdemic the police havent worn masks. Yet they\u2019ve been at all the protests with 1000s of different people, theyve been in multiple peoples homes and theyve been sat in the riot Van\u2019s 8 at a time. I havent seen 1 news story of an active copper dying from the \u2018virus\u2019\u201d.\n\nThe photo was taken by a Reuters photographer (sixth image in article here ) on May 16, 2020 in Hyde Park, London.\n\nGuidelines for police use of PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) were issued in April ( tinyurl.com/y6p9foo9 ) by the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council (NPCC). The guidelines state that police should have PPE readily available when on duty and they are advised to wear fluid resistant surgical masks when a risk of infection exists and social distancing is not possible.\n\nA spokesperson for London\u2019s Metropolitan Police confirmed to Reuters that their officers followed the NPCC guidelines. The spokesperson said: \u201cPolice officers will socially distance where possible and Personal Protective Equipment will be worn when necessary. It is up to each individual officer to decide whether PPE should be used in any given situation. Face coverings can be a barrier to communication and we will be careful about how and when we wear them.\u201d\n\nLegislation requiring people in England to wear face coverings on public transport includes an exemption for police ( here ).\n\nIt is not true that no police officer in the UK has died after contracting COVID-19. A detective with British Transport Police died on April 17 according to a report by the BBC here .\n\nFalse. UK police officers are required to wear masks in some situations in response to the pandemic and there has been a case of an officer dying after contracting the coronavirus.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
