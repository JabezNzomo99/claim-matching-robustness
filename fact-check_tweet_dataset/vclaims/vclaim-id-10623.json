ASCL says its members work in over 90% of secondary schools in the UK, so we do at least know that a wide spread of school leaders were asked to take part. About 6% of those asked chose to.\n\nOfficial statistics show the proportion of classes being taught in secondary schools by teachers without a relevant post A level qualification has been rising. This was the case for about 18% of English Baccalaureate subjects in 2014\u2014up from 14% in 2010. We won\u2019t have the figures for 2015 until June.\n\nMajority of respondents said they had recruited non-specialists\n\n789 people\u201489%\u2014responding to ASCL\u2019s survey said they were experiencing difficulties recruiting teachers.\n\nWhen asked what actions they had taken because of problems recruiting, 595 people said they had \u201csubjects taught by non-specialists\u201d. That was 73% of the people responding to that question, and 67% of all people taking part (885).\n\nThere\u2019s some fluctuation in the responses. More people answered the question about what actions they had taken due to problems recruiting (817 people) than said they were having problems recruiting (789 people). We can\u2019t say why this is.\n\nThe survey wasn\u2019t designed to be nationally representative\n\nThese results aren\u2019t weighted by things like where respondents\u2019 schools were located to match this up with the geographical spread of schools nationally.\n\nIf respondents were more heavily based in certain areas this could make quite a big difference to the results (either by inflating them or deflating them) as we know that there are localised differences in recruitment.\n\nASCL says the majority of respondents were from secondary schools.\n\nThe survey was sent to all 15,000 of ASCL\u2019s full members, who include head teachers, deputy head teachers and managers in schools and colleges. About 6% took part.\n\nWe don\u2019t know how typical the leaders responding were of all secondary schools. The fact that they chose to take part in the survey might mean that they had distinct experiences to those who didn\u2019t. Some of them might also have been responding from the same school.\n\nMore hours are being taught by non-specialist teachers\n\nThe proportion of lessons being taught in secondary schools by teachers without a relevant post A level qualification in the subject has grown in the official figures.\n\nIn maths, about 16% of lessons were taught by teachers with no relevant post A level qualifications in 2010 (the furthest back these figures go), rising to 20% in 2014.\n\nIn English, the equivalent figure rose from 12% in 2010 to 17% in 2014.\n\nTaking all the English Baccalaureate subjects together (English, maths, sciences, languages, history and geography), the proportion rose from 14% in 2010 to 18% in 2014, according to the National Audit Office (NAO).\n\nThe proportion of teachers in each subject without relevant post A level qualifications has also grown. More English, maths and science teachers lacked the relevant qualifications for their subjects in 2014 compared to 2013.\n\nAbout 24% of maths teachers and 21% of English teachers lacked relevant post A level qualifications for their subject in 2014.\n\nWe don\u2019t have the statistics yet for 2015.\n\nThe timing of these statistics\u2014which are collected in November every year\u2014may affect these results. There are fewer vacancies in teaching posts in November, according to the NAO, so this may also affect these statistics.", "lang": "en"}
