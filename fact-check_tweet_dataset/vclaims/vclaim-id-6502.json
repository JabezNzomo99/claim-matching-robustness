In fact, Gorsuch\u2019s spokesman confirmed the senator\u2019s account.\n\nGorsuch, a federal appeals court judge, has begun meeting with senators who will vote on his nomination.\n\nOn Feb. 8, Gorsuch met with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, who later told reporters that he asked the judge about Trump\u2019s Twitter attacks on a federal judge who issued a temporary restraining order blocking the president\u2019s immigration order. In a series of tweets, Trump attacked Judge James Robart as a \u201cso-called judge\u201d and warned that Robart\u2019s ruling \u201cput our country in such peril.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf something happens blame him and court system,\u201d Trump tweeted about Robart, an appointee of President George W. Bush.\n\nAt a closed meeting with Blumenthal, Gorsuch told the senator that he found Trump\u2019s remarks about Robart and the court \u201cdisheartening\u201d and \u201cdemoralizing,\u201d as reported by Bloomberg News and others.\n\nTrump accused Blumenthal of lying in a tweet on the morning after the senator\u2019s meeting with Gorsuch.\n\nThe only problem: Gorsuch\u2019s office confirmed Blumenthal\u2019s account, as reported by Bloomberg News, the Washington Post and others.\n\nUpdate, Feb. 9: Former Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who is guiding Gorsuch as he meets with senators, issued a statement that sought to clarify Gorsuch\u2019s remarks. According to Fox News, Ayotte said the judge made it \u201cvery clear\u201d in all of his meetings with senators that \u201cany criticism\u201d of judicial independence is \u201cdisheartening and demoralizing.\u201d\n\nFox News, Feb. 9: \u201cJudge Gorsuch has made it very clear in all of his discussions with senators, including Senator Blumenthal, that he could not comment on any specific cases and that judicial ethics prevent him from commenting on political matters,\u201d Ayotte said. \u201cHe has also emphasized the importance of an independent judiciary, and while he made clear that he was not referring to any specific case, he said that he finds any criticism of a judge\u2019s integrity and independence disheartening and demoralizing.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
