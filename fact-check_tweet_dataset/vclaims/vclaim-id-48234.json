San Francisco was ultimately one of the cities that suffered the most with a high death rate.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe post includes a black-and-white photo of policemen wearing masks over their mouths and noses. We did a reverse Google search and found the image matches a photo of policemen in a different city \u2014 Seattle \u2014 wearing masks in 1918.\n\nBut there are accurate statements in the text, which draws from a source at the University of Michigan. We found that there was such a thing as the Anti-Mask League in San Francisco in January 1919. The city did have one of the highest death rates from the flu, but the authors said they can\u2019t prove whether the Anti-Mask League played a role.\n\nRELATED: What the 1918 flu pandemic shows us about social distancing\n\nHat tip to NPR reporter Tim Mak for digging up the history of the Anti-Mask League and sharing it in a Twitter thread. Mak pulled from an essay by J. Alexander Navarro at the University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine, a book by Alfred W. Crosby, America\u2019s Forgotten Pandemic and the San Francisco Chronicle archives.\n\nAs the number of flu cases rose in October 1918 in San Francisco, the city passed an ordinance requiring everyone to wear a mask in public except at mealtime.\n\nMask wearing was promoted as a symbol of patriotism. Gov. William Stephens told Californians it was a \"patriotic duty for every American citizen\" to wear a mask.\n\nCity officials and local newspapers reported widespread compliance with the mask order initially, Navarro found. But some resisted the rules, and police arrested 110 people on Oct. 27 for not wearing their masks or for failing to keep them properly adjusted. The majority were fined $5, though some went to jail.\n\nIn November, with cases declining, the city started to lift restrictions, although it still required masks. People flocked to public venues including theaters and sports arenas. At a boxing match, the city\u2019s mayor and city health officer were photographed not wearing masks, for which they were fined.\n\nLater that month, the mayor annulled the ordinance. But new cases quickly emerged, and the mask ordinance was reinstated in January.\n\nOpponents formed the Anti-Mask League, multiple news articles in January 1919 show. Crosby wrote in his book that the league consisted of \"public-spirited citizens, physicians and fanatics.\"\n\nAt a meeting of the Anti-Mask League \"resolutions were passed denouncing the mask ordinance as contrary to the desires of the majority of the people,\" the San Francisco Examiner reported. Nearly 2,000 people attended.\n\nThe league got their wish, and the mask rule was rescinded Feb. 1.\n\nSan Francisco was among the hardest-hit cities\n\nNavarro and colleagues studied how 43 cities fared during the 1918 pandemic and published their results in the Journal of the American Medical Association. They found that many cities experienced second waves after ending social distancing.\n\nSan Francisco had one of the higher excess-death rates: 673 per 100,000 people.\n\n\"It is impossible to say for certainty that the advent of the Anti-Mask League played a role in that outcome,\" Navarro told PolitiFact \"Undoubtedly, having over 2,000 people gather would have helped continue to spread influenza.\"\n\nThe main factors in San Francisco\u2019s outcome, however, were failure to implement interventions such as social distancing quickly and failure to keep them in place long enough.\n\nNavarro said he didn\u2019t find something similar to the Anti-Mask League in other cities. Only a few other cities implemented mandatory face mask orders, while others recommended that the public use masks.\n\nA Facebook post said during the 1918 flu pandemic, San Francisco residents formed an \"Anti-Mask League.\" San Francisco \"was ultimately one of the cities that suffered the most with a high death rate.\"\n\nResidents angry about the reinstatement of a mask order did form the Anti-Mask League in January 1919. It appeared to be short-lived, as the mask rule was quickly rescinded. Researchers found that San Francisco did have one of the higher death rates in the country, but it is impossible to say whether that was directly related to the mask protests.\n\nA photo of masked police officers that accompanies the post is real, but it shows officers in Seattle.\n\nWe rate this statement Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
