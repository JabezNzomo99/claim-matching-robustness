The claim is false; the photo shows a dog\u2019s heart, not a human heart, and experts say the disease is not fatal for humans.\n\n\n\nThe image has been shared multiple times on Facebook, for example here, and in this post shared more than 89,000 since it was published on March 6, 2019.\n\nThere is text above the photo of the heart that says: \u201cA bad practice is to humanize pets. I\u2019m sending you a kid\u2019s heart that, due to sleeping and kissing his dog, it transmitted its parasites.\n\n\u201cThose parasites blocked his heart and he died here at the Children\u2019s Hospital. Please forward this to family and friends.\u201d \n\n\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nA reverse image search found that the same photo appeared in this article on the website of the American Society for Microbiology, which says the research was published online on July 3, 2012.\n\nThe article, titled \u201cHuman and Animal Dirofilariasis: the Emergence of a Zoonotic Mosaic\u201d, uses the photo with the caption: \u201cFig 2: Male and female adult worms of D. immitis in the heart of a dog\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo as it appears in the article:\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has an FAQ page on its website here about the disease caused by the worm mentioned in the scientific article, D. immitis \u2013 also known as \u201cheartworm\u201d.\n\nIt says: \u201cD. immitis adult worms can cause pulmonary artery blockage in dogs, leading to an illness that can include cough, exhaustion upon exercise, fainting, coughing up blood, and severe weight loss.\u201d\n\nThe CDC site says that the disease can occur in humans but it is very rare, with just 81 cases reported in the US between 1941 and 2005, and affects human lungs, not the heart.\n\nAFP spoke by phone to Jan Slapeta, Professor of Veterinary and Molecular Parasitology at the University of Sydney, who said the image in the Facebook post was misleading and that heartworm disease was \u201cnot fatal\u201d for humans.\n\n\u201cThere is no such thing as a human heart in this way. I\u2019m not aware of any worm of this size that would be in the bloodstream of a human,\u201d he said, referring to the photo.\n\nIn humans, heartworm disease is \u201cvery rare and really causes nothing. It\u2019s what we call asymptomatic\u201d, he said.\n\nBoth Professor Slapeta and the CDC website said that humans can only be infected with heartworms through mosquito bites, not by sleeping next to or kissing a dog.\n\nThis article, titled \u201cCan humans get heartworms from dogs?\u201d, was published on healthline.com and medically reviewed by a doctor on July 31, 2018, according to the website. It corroborates the information given by Professor Slapeta and in the CDC article.\n\nIt says: \u201cYou can\u2019t get heartworms from your dogs, cats, or other pets \u2013 only from mosquitos that carry the infection.\n\n\u201cMost heartworm microfilariae die on their way through the skin. Even if they do get into your blood somehow, heartworms can\u2019t mature and will eventually die off.\n\n\u201cIn most cases, heartworms in humans aren\u2019t a serious problem unless they cause pain, discomfort, and other noticeable symptoms.\u201d\n\nComments on the misleading posts like the one in the screenshot below indicate that some Facebook users who saw the post believed it:", "lang": "en"}
