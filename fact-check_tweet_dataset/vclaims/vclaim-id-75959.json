Dan Branch and Jim Pitts are helping Ellen Cohen against her Republican challenger, doing events with her in her district.\u201d Background: Branch and Pitts, supporters of Straus for speaker, were appointed by him to chair major committees.\n\nTo back his Branch charge, Barton pointed us to 25 photos posted online in March by Cohen, a Houston Democrat. The photos, arrayed under the header \u201cHigher Education Forum,\u201d include a shot of Branch, R-Dallas, standing at a lectern in front of a slide headlined \u201cPlanning For A Budget Shortfall.\u201d\n\nBarton later elaborated in an e-mail: \u201cIt is not (standard operating procedure) to do such events in settings in which Republicans help make a single Democrat look favorable to her constituents -- especially when it is in the midst of the campaign cycle rather than the policy/legislative cycle.\u201d\n\nBranch and Cohen each told us that Cohen, a member of the House Higher Education Committee, invited Branch, the committee chair, to speak to residents at a public forum on Feb. 25. Branch said whenever a member of the higher education committee extends such an invitation, he\u2019s got to give it consideration, and that he and Cohen took pains to keep the forum non-political.\n\n\u201cI told her I didn\u2019t think it would be helpful to do it once the general election process was in place,\u201d said Branch. The forum took place before Cohen\u2019s Republican opponent, Sarah Davis, was nominated in the March 2 primary.\n\n\u201cMost Republicans who understand the facts will realize I did the right thing,\u201d Branch said. He also said he has not endorsed Cohen: \u201cI have not campaigned for her, I have not given her a contribution.\u201d\n\nWhat of Republican Pitts helping Cohen? Barton pointed us to a Web post by Cohen\u2019s campaign inviting visitors to a 90-minute \u201cAppropriations Forum\u201d on May 6 featuring Pitts, R-Waxahachie, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, on which Cohen sits.\n\nCohen writes in the Pitts-related post: \u201cI respect Chairman Pitts\u2019 leadership and value his insights as we are face critical days of current cuts and budget shortfalls. I appreciate his willingness to travel to Houston and be a part of this forum.\u201d\n\nPitts told us he might have erred by agreeing to speak at the forum in an election year. \u201cI didn\u2019t go there to help Ellen, that wasn\u2019t the purpose. But I learned my lesson. I am going to be very careful. My timing probably should be before a primary, or even before people file\u201d their candidacies in December and early January before the primaries.\n\nPitts said Davis\u2019s husband approached him after he spoke to question his remark that \u201cEllen and I have our hands full next session\u201d-- implying Pitts expects Cohen to win re-election. \u201cI did say that; I guess I\u2019m guilty,\u201d Pitts said.\n\nKent Adams, the GOP nominee\u2019s husband, later told us he took note of Cohen campaign signs outside the Pitts\u2019 engagement and campaign literature at the Branch event.\n\nTammi Wallace, Cohen\u2019s chief of staff, said the signs were put up so audience members could find their way in.\n\nAdams said Cohen campaign workers and campaign literature were at both events. Wallace said there was no literature as such, though campaign-funded constituent survey cards were put out and Cohen campaign staff members attended the forums \u201cbecause the campaign staff is expected to pitch in and do whatever they need to do to help out.\u201d\n\nWould Pitts accept invitations to speak at forums hosted by Democratic House incumbents facing Republican challengers this November? \u201cI would pass,\u201d Pitts said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to send the wrong signal. I would go any place (to speak) but I don\u2019t want to do it with a Democrat and I\u2019m not going to do it for any Republican against an incumbent Democrat.\u201d\n\nHis rationale: He\u2019ll need the support of members of both parties to advance the next state budget. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to pass a bill,\u201d Pitts said.\n\nAre Branch and Pitts \u201chelping\u201d Cohen against her GOP opponent by speaking to her constituents, as Barton claims? Adams, Davis\u2019s husband/campaign manager, said that Cohen obviously intended for the GOP speakers to boost her campaign, but few people turned out for Branch, he said, and tax talk at Pitts\u2019 stop was off-putting. \u201cThey were inconsequential,\u201d he said.\n\nFor her part, Cohen characterized the appearances by Pitts and Branch as informational instead of political. \u201cThe story to me is the fact that two Republican chairs of committees I serve on willingly agreed to come in and educate my district,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat we find: Barton\u2019s statement accurately refers to the GOP House members appearing at events with Cohen at her invitation, in her district. But the two forums weren\u2019t political rallies--and even her opponent\u2019s campaign manager saw no boon for Cohen.", "lang": "en"}
