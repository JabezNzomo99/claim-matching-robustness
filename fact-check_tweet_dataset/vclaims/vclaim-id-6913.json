Francis \"Kiko\" Pangilinan said attacks against Vice President Leni Robredo and former Tourism Secretary Ramon Jimenez are meant to distract the public from issues hounding the Duterte administration.\n\nIts biggest traffic generators on social media are Duterte Saviours Of Filipinos Today, Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos and Pilipinas Trends.\n\nPhworkit.top has been publishing stories since March 2017, RealNews ThatMatter since March 2016.\n\n(Editor's Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.
