The verdict is unchanged. This story was originally published January 5, 2019].\n\nFollowing the December 28, 2018 arrest in Moscow of Paul Whelan, an American citizen charged with espionage, former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul tweeted:\n\n\u201cI often get asked if it\u2019s safe to travel to Russia as a tourist or student. I always used to say yes, and with enthusiasm. After Whelan arrest, however, I will change my advice.\u201d\n\nWriting for RT, the Russian state media outlet, Ryan attacked McFaul for changing his position on the safety of traveling to Russia in the wake of the Whelan arrest: \u201cMiraculously, the arrest of one American seems to have changed everything. It is unlikely, however, that McFaul issued similar advice to his Russian friends after the arrest of Russian citizen Maria Butina, who last year was accused of acting as a foreign agent in the United States without proper registration.\u201d\n\nRyan writes that the assumption would never be made that the U.S. is unsafe for Russian tourists based on Butina\u2019s arrest, adding that is not because the U.S. is a \u201ccrime-free paradise where justice reigns supreme.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s because of endless and tiresome double standards imposed on Russia by both US officials and the media,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s always one assumption for the US and another for Russia; Whelan is an American arrested in Moscow, so he must be innocent (and Russia must be dangerous), but Butina was a Russian arrested in Washington DC, so she must be guilty (and the US is simply seeking justice). Facts and evidence become irrelevant in the rush to compound the \u2018correct\u2019 narrative.\u201d\n\nButina, in fact, pleaded guilty on December 13, 2018 to conspiracy and acting under the direction of the Russian government.\n\nIn her plea deal, Butina admitted to conspiring with a Russian official and two Americans to infiltrate the National Rifle Association to create unofficial lines of communication between Russian officials and U.S. conservatives, with the goal of advancing Russia\u2019s interests. As part of her plea deal, one count of acting as a covert foreign agent was dropped. She faces a maximum of five years in prison and the prospect of deportation upon completing her sentence.\n\nThe case surrounding Whelan, a Canadian-born former U.S. Marine and security executive who has British and Irish citizenship, is unclear.\n\nA security source told the Russian news agency Rosbalt that Whelan was caught \u201cred-handed\u201d in his Metropol hotel room receiving a flash drive with a list of employees of a Russian security agency.\n\nRosbalt is run by Natalia Cherkesova, the wife of Viktor Cherkesov, a Putin associate, former first deputy director of the Federal Security Service and former head of Russia\u2019s Federal Drug Control Service.\n\nRegarding the thumb drive, Journalist Julia Ioffe tweeted that Russian police and secret services are notorious for planting evidence on suspects. She added: \u201cDoesn't mean that Whelan is not a spy, but just something to keep in mind.\u201d\n\nJohn Sipher, who ran the CIA\u2019s operations in Russia, told the Washington Post the agency would \u201calmost never send someone to Russia without diplomatic immunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven the laxity of Russian laws and the aggressiveness of their espionage apparatus, we could not guarantee the safety of someone traveling under unofficial cover,\u201d Sipher said.\n\nJournalist Julia Davis said that Whelan's lawyer, Vladimir Zherebenkov, who has represented \u201cnumerous\u201d senior Russian government officials, has already floated the idea of an exchange for Butina.\n\n\u201cThis is a long process,\u201d Davis quoted Zherebenkov as saying. \u201cI myself hope that we can rescue and bring home one Russian soul.\u201d -- to which McFaul commented: \u201cSounds like Zherebenkov is representing Butina, not Whelan.\u201d\n\nIf convicted, Whelan faces 20 years in prison, which would make him the first U.S. citizen sentenced in Russia on espionage charges since the conviction of Edmond Pope in 2000.\n\nIn response to Ryan, McFaul wrote that \u201ca regime that arbitrarily arrests foreigners is a dangerous one.\u201d But regarding Whelan\u2019s guilt or innocence, he added: \u201cIf Im wrong about Whelan, Ill delete tweet.\u201d (sic)\n\nMcFaul later tweeted that the State Department had issued a travel advisory saying \u201cexactly the same thing\u201d as he had written: \u201c[E]xercise increased caution due to terrorism, harassment, and the arbitrary enforcement of local laws.\u201d\n\nThe State Department further said that \u201cU.S. citizens visiting or residing in Russia have been arbitrarily interrogated or detained by Russian officials and may become victims of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion.\u201d\n\nIt further notes that \u201cterrorist attacks and risk of civil unrest continue throughout the North Caucasus region, including in Chechnya, North Ossetia, Ingushetia, Dagestan, Stavropol, Karachayevo-Cherkessiya, and Kabardino-Balkariya. Local gangs have kidnapped U.S. citizens and other foreigners for ransom.\u201d\n\nRyan also wrote that \u201cRussia is as safe for American tourists (or any other tourists, for that matter) as any other European country is,\u201d adding that \u201cthe fact that a former official who really should know better is perpetuating the myth of deep, dark, dangerous Russia is utterly ridiculous.\u201d\n\nWe judge Ryan\u2019s op-ed to be misleading at best, and major elements of her argument to be simply untrue.\n\nIt is true that the U.S. State Department lists Russia at a \u201cLevel 2\u201d travel advisory -- the same as Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, Serbia, Spain, Britain, Italy, Ukraine and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The State Department updated its judgment on Russia in mid-December, before the Whelan arrest.\n\nConsider, also, information gleaned from the United Nations.\n\nCiting the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Alexandra Lysova of Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, Candadaand Nikolay Shchitov of the Far Eastern Federal University, Russia, noted that as of 2014, Russia\u2019s homicide rate was \u201cthe highest in Europe and one of the highest in the world.\u201d\n\nThat figure has dropped significantly, from a peak of 33 per 100,000 people in 1994 to 10.82 per 100,000 or 15,561 \u201cintentional homicides\u201d in 2016, according to the UNODC.\n\nLysova told Polygraph.info that while \u201cimproved quality of life and political stability in Russia in the 2000s\u201d could potentially explain the declining murder rate, a so-called \u2018decivilizing process,\u2019 characterized by rampant corruption, predatory policing, political repression, state violence against businesses, rising xenophobia and apathy, could \u201clikewise be expected to be associated with a less precipitous decline in homicide or stable homicide rate in this period.\u201d\n\nLysova, assistant professor in the School of Criminology at Simon Fraser University and once a professor in Vladivostok, Russia said she shares the concerns of other Russian criminologists who doubt that murder rates dropped as precipitously as the statistics show.\n\n\u201cBy considering legal mechanisms alone, the more accurate homicide rate may be at least 1.6 times higher than that reported by the police and reprinted in the UNODC Global Study on Homicide 2013. Sergey Inshakov in his book on a dark figure of crime in Russia (2011) also suggested that there was no a precipitous decline in murder rates and that the real murder rates were much higher than those reported by the police in the 2000s.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ryan \u201cfelt safer\u201d walking in Moscow after dark than Washington D.C. or Budapest, nationwide, Russia has a higher per capita homicide rate than Hungary or the United States.\n\nFor 2016, the UNODC registered 17,250 intentional homicides in the United States or 5.35 per 100,000 people \u2013 roughly half the level in Russia.\n\nThe rate in Hungary was 2.07 per 100,000 or 202 intentional homicides.\n\nStatistically, however, Moscow is a much safer city than Washington D.C. in terms of intentional homicide.\n\nAccording to the Russian Federal State Statistics Service, Moscow city itself registered 2.5 murders per 100,000 people, while Moscow region registered 6.9 murders per 100,000 people.\n\nIn Washington D.C., there were 116 homicides in 2017 or 17 per 100,000 residents, making it America\u2019s 16th most dangerous city, according to an analysis conducted by USA Today.\n\nHomicide statistics for Budapest that year were unavailable.\n\nBut as Lysova noted, the statistics in Russia\u2019s case do not tell the entire story.\n\nAnd it is not just homicide. Lysova said a quick scan of police statistics for showed that there had only been 3,900 reported rapes for all of 2015.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s reasonable to expect that the number of rapes, including attempts, should exceed the number of homicides, including attempts,\u201d she said. \u201cSome unofficial estimates of 10,000 people who became victims of rape in Russia in 2015 seem more realistic. Organizations that help female victims of sexual abuse in Russia provide estimates that only 10-12% of rape victims actually report incidents to the police in Russia. Victims are ashamed and afraid they will not be treated by the police fairly and with respect. Moreover, even if victims decide to report the incidents to the police, only one in about five incidents would be accepted and investigated by the police.\u201d\n\nIt is currently too early to determine if the cases of Whelan and Butina are commensurate. Any conclusions (or comparisons) at this point would be purely speculative.\n\nBut Polygraph.info finds that Ryan\u2019s claim that Russia is as safe for American tourists as any other European country is misleading.", "lang": "en"}
