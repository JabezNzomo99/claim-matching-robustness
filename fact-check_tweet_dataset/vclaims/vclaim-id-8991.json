Trump tweeted afterwards \"Wow, Ted Cruz got booed off the stage, didn't honor the pledge!\"\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about what Cruz said about party loyalty pledges during the 2016 pledge.\n\nAll of the Republican candidates were supposed to sign a loyalty pledge by the Republican National Committee, we reported in an article about former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and the pledge.\n\nThe pledge was intended to get Trump to commit to not run as a third-party candidate. At the first GOP debate on Aug. 6, Trump said he wouldn\u2019t rule out a third-party run.\n\n\"I (name) affirm that if I do not win the 2016 Republican nomination for president of the United States I will endorse the 2016 Republican presidential nominee regardless of who it is. I further pledge that I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate nor will I seek or accept the nomination for president of any other party.\"\n\nThe one-page document included spots for signatures from RNC chairman Reince Priebus and the candidate. Trump held a press conference at Trump Tower in Manhattan on Sept. 3 to announce he had signed the pledge (which was mistakenly dated Aug. 3, although Trump later tweeted a corrected copy).\n\n\"I will be totally pledging my allegiance to the Republican Party and the conservative principles for which it stands,\" Trump said.\n\nSo did Cruz sign the pledge? We couldn\u2019t find a copy of the pledge itself and didn\u2019t hear back from spokespersons for Cruz or the RNC Wednesday night.\n\nHowever, in May spokespersons for Trump\u2019s campaign and the RNC told PolitiFact Florida that all of the GOP candidates signed a pledge.\n\nAnother pledge was put forward by the South Carolina Republican Party, which required candidates to sign a pledge and submit it with $40,000 by Sept. 30 to qualify for the state primary ballot in February. The pledge stated \"I hereby affirm that I generally believe in and intend to support the nominees and platform of the Republican Party in the November 8, 2016, general election.\"\n\nWe didn\u2019t find a signed pledge by Cruz online Wednesday night. However, state party officials announced on Sept. 30 that 15 candidates including Cruz had qualified for the state\u2019s ballot.\n\nCruz wasn\u2019t the only candidate to make conflicting comments about whether he would back the nominee.\n\nOn March 12, three days before the Florida primary, Cruz said he would support the nominee although he had criticized Trump saying that he \"affirmatively encourages violence.\"\n\n\"I committed at the outset, I will support the Republican nominee, whoever it is.\" Cruz told reporters at a suburban St. Louis high school\n\nA day later, he made a similar comment to MSNBC\u2019s Chuck Todd:\n\nTodd: \"You've said some tough things on Trump. Why are you comfortable supporting him as the nominee if he ends up the nominee.\"\n\nCruz: \"Well, listen, I pledged at the outset I will support the Republican nominee, whoever it is ... when I give my word for something, I follow through and do what I said.\"\n\nBut on March 30 at a CNN town hall, Cruz -- as well as Trump and Kasich -- appeared to back away from the pledge. That was shortly after Trump had promised to \"spill the beans\" on Cruz\u2019s wife Heidi.\n\n\"I'm not in the habit of supporting someone who attacks my wife and my family,\" Cruz said.\n\nWhen Cruz dropped out of the primary after losing the Indiana primary May 3, he made no mention of whether he would support the eventual nominee.\n\nA week later, Cruz told conservative talk show host Glenn Beck that picking a presidential candidate \"is not a choice that we as voters have to make today.\"\n\nExperts previously told PolitiFact Florida in May that the pledge was essentially a promise by a candidate. But it\u2019s not the same thing as a legal contract.\n\n\"The pledge is no more binding than any other politician's promise: It is enforceable through the public's future support or lack thereof for the person making the pledge,\" said Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California.\n\nEmory University law professor Michael Kang said the oaths create political pressure but not much more. \"I don\u2019t think there are meaningful legal sanctions under these oaths for failing to do so at this point,\" he said.\n\nNorman Ornstein, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, noted in May that Trump said several times he would only adhere to the pledge if he were treated fairly, and that he would decide what that meant.\n\n\"Of course, Trump has a telling point here,\" Ornstein said. \"The only reason the pledge was raised was to jawbone and bludgeon Trump into staying as a Republican. So there is plenty of hypocrisy on the part of other candidates. But this whole exercise, including Trump's outlandish notion that this is a question of honor, given his own past statements, makes them all look foolish.\"", "lang": "en"}
