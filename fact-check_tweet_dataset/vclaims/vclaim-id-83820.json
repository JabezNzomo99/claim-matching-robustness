The same photo has been used repeatedly for a decade on many social media platforms and blog pages in multiple languages to make similar claims about the words on the soles, but saying that the shoes were made by Nike or Puma. None of the claims are true; the photo is a manipulated image based on an original published by Getty Images in 2008 from a protest by Palestinians against then-US president George W. Bush.\n\nThis version has been shared 201,000 times since being posted on Facebook in April, 2018.\n\nThe Urdu writing above the photo, when translated to English, says: \u201c\"Warning! Be careful when buying shoes. Don't unwittingly wear these shoes made by an Israeli company\".\n\nThe writing circled in red states: \u201cCurse of Allah on him who does not share\u201d.\n\nA Google reverse image search of the image (using a screenshot from another post without the misleading text) showed dozens of results that linked it to similar claims, or allegations that the shoes were made by global brands Puma and Nike.\n\nHere are the results of the search.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of one page from the results showing the image on various social media platforms, and in multiple languages including English, Russian, Arabic and Chinese.\n\nMany of the results trace back to campaigns against Puma and Nike.\n\nHere is a blog published in 2009 calling for a boycott of the two shoe companies for \u201cusing the name of Allah\u201d, and here is a similar one from 2012.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the 2009 blog:\n\nHowever, the reverse image search also produces some results that show the same photo with the word \u201cBush\u201d written on one of the soles.\n\nClicking on these images leads to various news reports that say the image was taken on December 16, 2008, of a Palestinian man protesting against Bush in the Gaza Strip.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of one of the results from the search.\n\nThe original image is viewable here on Getty\u2019s image online platform.\n\nBelow is the caption to the photo on the Getty website.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the image on Getty's website:\n\nThe photographer, Abid Katib, took another image of the same man at that protest.\n\nAgence France-Presse is a partner of Getty and both images are also available to see here on AFPForum.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the other image:", "lang": "en"}
