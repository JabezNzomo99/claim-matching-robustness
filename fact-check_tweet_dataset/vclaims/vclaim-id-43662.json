Kennedy and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev were able to reach an agreement that ended what often has been described as the most dangerous confrontation between the two superpowers during the Cold War.\n\n\u201cIndeed it is arguable that without his prolonged visit to the U.S. in 1959, Khrushchev may not have been so willing to accommodate JFK (the late-President John F. Kennedy) during the Cuban Missile Crisis three years later in 1962\u2026\u201d Wight said.\n\nMark Kramer, the director of the Russian and Eurasian program of Cold War Studies at Harvard University, called this assertion \u201cnonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe meeting Khrushchev had with Kennedy in Vienna in May 1961 left him with contempt for the U.S. president,\u201d Kramer told Polygraph.info. \u201cThe notion that the meetings with [U.S. President Dwight D.] Eisenhower and others in October 1959 were the crucial factor in shaping Khrushchev's behavior three years later is preposterous. What shaped Khrushchev's behavior in October 1962 was the sudden realization that a large-scale nuclear exchange was a distinct possibility, the same realization that shaped Kennedy's behavior in making important concessions to Khrushchev to resolve the crisis.\u201d\n\nWight\u2019s conclusion merits a fact check since a distinct comparison can be made:\n\nIf it were true that Khrushchev\u2019s single visit to the United States helped resolve the missile crisis, then Vladimir Putin has at least nine times the reason to \u201chumanize\u201d the U.S. Public records show he visited the U.S. twice before becoming Russia\u2019s president, and seven times during his three previous terms in the Kremlin. Some of his U.S. trips involved experience in American life well beyond the usual diplomatic rituals and government settings \u2013 debunking Wight\u2019s claim that Putin lacks a \u201chumanizing\u201d experience of the U.S\n\nHere is the chronology.\n\nIn a March 5, 2000 interview with British journalist David Frost, Putin said he had visited the United States before becoming Russia\u2019s president. \u201cI have twice been to the United States on very short visits, on business,\u201d Putin said.\n\nAnatoly Sobchak was mayor of St. Petersburg in the early 1990s, and Putin served as his deputy. Sobchak died suddenly while on a campaign trip supporting Putin\u2019s first presidential bid in 2000, and there were rumors he was poisoned.\n\nPutin\u2019s first official visit to the U.S. as Russian president took place five months after the Frost interview. He participated in the United Nations Millennium Summit in New York City and met with the outgoing U.S. President Bill Clinton.\n\nPutin\u2019s \u201cMillennial\u201d visit to New York City made headlines in mainstream U.S. media mostly because of his infamous response to the CNN\u2019s Larry King question about the Russian navy submarine Kursk that sank in the Barents Sea in August 2000, killing all 118 men aboard. The tragedy captured the world\u2019s attention, and the Russian government and Putin personally were accused of insufficient rescue efforts. When King asked the Russian leader,\u201c What happened with the submarine?\u201d Putin smiled and said: \u201cIt sank.\u201d\n\nPutin spent November 12-15, 2001, in the company of newly-elected U.S. President George W. Bush. Putin visited the White House, and a report on the visit, along with the eight photographs of the two leaders, is available in the archives of the White House website.\n\n\"This is a new day in the long history of Russian-American relations, a day of progress and a day of hope,\" President Bush said during a joint press conference with Putin at the White House on November 13. The two presidents traveled to President Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas.\n\n\"He'll also get a taste of rural life here in Texas,\" Bush said of the Russian leader's visit. \"He'll get to see Houston, and he's also going to get to come to Crawford.\" Putin and Bush visited Crawford High School and spoke to students there, the New York Times noting they \u201cwere clearly more at ease with each other than Mr. Bush's father ever was with Mikhail S. Gorbachev.\u201d\n\nPutin was a guest of the U.S. president at the Camp David residence during the weekend of September 26-27, 2003. The meeting reportedly did not produce the results George W. Bush hoped for \u2013 Russia\u2019s commitment to aid U.S. forces in Iraq or a pledge to end Russian assistance to Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\n\u201cWhile the two leaders underscored what they termed a close diplomatic and personal relationship, the meeting at Camp David nevertheless pointed up sharp differences between the nations and Bush's ongoing difficulty in rallying world support behind U.S. efforts in Iraq,\u201d the Chicago Tribune reported at the time.\n\nBy the beginning of Vladimir Putin\u2019s second official presidential term in March 2004, even the most optimistic Russia watchers have already started questioning Moscow\u2019s commitment to democratic changes, often pointing out Putin\u2019s \u201cautocratic tendencies.\u201d\n\nThen-U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell described Putin\u2019s rule in Russia as \u201cnot fully tethered to the law\u201d and Christopher Cox, a U.S. Representative from California and the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee wrote in an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, that \u201c[M]ore than a decade after the collapse of the Soviet Empire, and six years after G-8 admission, Russia has failed to complete a successful transition from communism to free enterprise, and from a Soviet police state to a stable, securely democratic society.\u201d\n\nSeptember 2005 and June-July 2007 \u2013 New York City and Kennebunkport, Maine\n\nGeorge W. Bush and Vladimir Putin had two more meetings on the U.S. soil before the end of Bush\u2019s second term in the White House.\n\nOn September 15, 2005, the Russian president addressed the UN General Assembly, and visited the White House in Washington, DC on September 16.\n\nDuring the Q and A at the joint press conference one reporter asked, \u201cThe Russian-U.S. relationship largely is based on your good personal relations. In year 2008, you both will cease to be Presidents. So have you laid any guarantees so that U.S.-Russia relationship could go on not worse than it does right now?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre they already firing us? We still want to work,\u201d Putin responded laughing.\n\nOn June 30, 2006 Vladimir Putin \u2013 the sole world leader to receive such invitation \u2013 stayed overnight at the Bush family Kennebunkport summer home on the coast of Main.\n\nVladimir Putin, in his third term as Russia\u2019s President and now his government with a history of journalist killings, repression of the media and civil libertarians, mass protests in Russia against his rule and with ongoing involvement in at least three conflicts, namely Georgia, Ukraine and Syria, spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on September 28, 2015. Putin was portrayed in the Western press as \u201cfacilitating the continued menace of the Islamic State\u201d by \u201cpropping up Assad\u2019s government\u201d in Syria.\n\nPutin\u2019s first formal meeting with the U.S. President Barack Obama was portrayed by journalists and experts as \u201cquite awkward\u201d or \u201ccomically awkward.\u201d\n\n\u201cPutin has been to the United States numerous times and has met with U.S. leaders elsewhere many other times. None of this has made him warm up to the United States, a country he deeply resents and wants to undermine,\u201d Kramer told Polygraph.info.\n\nFinally, Putin does not need a special invitation to come to the United States \u2013 as Russia\u2019s leader he has a standing invitation to participate in the United Nations annual General Assembly sessions, like the one that opens September 17 in New York City, to run until October 5. Putin skipped three previous GA sessions since 2015 and was represented instead by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.", "lang": "en"}
