He bragged about killing large numbers of Ukrainian soldiers and denounced \u201cattacks\u201d against him, claiming that \u201cnot one field commander got such results as I have.\u201d However, an examination of his time with a battalion in Donbas quickly belies the Russian author\u2019s claims.\n\nPrilepin has a rudimentary military background, having served with the Russian Interior Ministry\u2019s OMON (Special Purpose Mobile Detachment) unit in Chechnya and Dagestan in 1996 and 1999. However, when Prilepin was in Donbas in February 2017 to July 2018, allegedly serving with the 4th Reconnaissance Assault Battalion of the Army of the \u201cDonetsk People\u2019s Republic,\u201d he was often identified as a \u201cdeputy commander\u201d or \u201cpolitical instructor.\u201d\n\nThe Digital Forensic Laboratory (DFRLab), the Atlantic Council\u2019s investigative reporting project, identified the battalion\u2019s actual commander as another Russian citizen from Smolensk named Sergei Fomchenkov. Listed as the battalion\u2019s \u201ccommandant\u201d was a man named Oleg Barminov, also a Russian citizen from Yaroslavl. In the DFRLab\u2019s source, Prilepin is listed as deputy commander. This is followed by a long list of personnel with accompanying photos. Many of them are listed as being from cities and towns in Russia, and some come from other states such as Latvia and Serbia.\n\nThe formation and composition of the battalion is crucial to verifying Prilepin\u2019s claims for several reasons.\n\nFirst, for a \u201cbattalion\u201d it was small - just under 200 men, and the DFR Lab does describe him as being in charge of a \u201clarge number of men.\u201d Yet documents have been posted listing the names of the men. In unit photos there are rarely more than a few dozen men visible - more often much fewer.\n\nSecond, it was based in rather comfortable accommodations within Donetsk\u2019s four-star Hotel Praha. Most damning of all was the time of its founding, documented as October 2016. The battalion allegedly deployed to the front only in December of 2016. Major combat operations in Ukraine ended in the summer of 2015. Since then, while there have been many ceasefire violations sometimes on a daily basis, the number of casualties on the Ukrainian side have been slight. Offensive operations in recent years have been almost exclusively carried out by the Ukrainian side, typically involving the seizure of minute territories within what is known as the gray zone.\n\nThen there is the question of Prilepin\u2019s actual involvement in combat. While there is footage of him in the trenches during a segment on Russian state TV, it is impossible to tell where he is or who is actually firing. What is known is that during his time with the battalion, Prilepin supposedly worked as a \u201cpolitical instructor\u201d and even managed to host a weekly TV program on the Russian state-owned TV network NTV. He also may have served as an advisor to the late leader of the \u201cDNR\u201d Alexander Zakharchenko, who claimed to have personally given Prilepin the rank of major in his armed forces. Curiously, Prilepin left his battalion and returned to Moscow in late July 2018, nearly one month before Zakharchenko was assassinated by a bomb placed in a Donetsk caf\u00e9. Naturally Prilepin\u2019s sudden absence shortly before the assassination, as well as his closeness to Vladislav Surkov, the Kremlin\u2019s point-man in Donbas, led to some speculation about the novelist\u2019s departure at a time Zakharchenko\u2019s grip on power was weakening. After the assassination, in September, members of the battalion were surrounded in their HQ in the Hotel Praha by armed men loyal to the \u201cDNR\u2019s\u201d new leader, Denis Pushilin. After a short \u201csiege\u201d the unit was disbanded.\n\nBased on the 4th Reconnaissance-Assault Battalion\u2019s unit history, originating long after the last major battles of the war, and based on Prilepin\u2019s known activities during his time with the unit, it\u2019s clear his boasting about killing large numbers of Ukrainian soldiers and getting better \u201cresults\u201d than any other field commander on the Russian side are likely an invention. Based on his numerous TV appearances it would be more apt to refer to Prilepin\u2019s sojourn in Donbas as a PR stunt.\n\nIn fact, that conclusion is backed up by a Facebook post made by one of the battalion\u2019s former members, the aforementioned Oleg Barminov.\n\n\u201cThe battalion, was not a combat unit,\u201d Barminov wrote in late September 2018.\n\n\u201cIt always occupied positions on the second and third lines of defense, that is, it guarded lines of communication in Donetsk. The command was always striving to be closer to the leadership of the Republic and further from the front. In Donetsk they openly called us a PR battalion,\u201d Barminov posted.", "lang": "en"}
