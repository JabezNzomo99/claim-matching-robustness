Welp, researchers at Stanford's School of Medicine suspect it's because CA had already developed \u2018herd immunity\u2019 to the virus. They're now conducting a study to find this out. Makes sense. \u2026 Building \u2018herd immunity\u2019 is the only way to get rid of a virus when there is no vaccine.\"\n\nThe post also claims that California is a leading tourist destination for people from China and theorizes that the virus has been \"kicking around\" California \"since October or November.\" It was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nHerd immunity, also called \"herd protection,\" is a real phenomenon. It\u2019s when the percentage of the population immune to a virus becomes so high that the virus virtually dies off. But experts, pointing to how relatively little testing is being done, say there is no evidence of herd immunity for COVID-19 anywhere, let alone just in California.\n\nThe numbers of COVID-19 deaths cited in the April 10 Facebook post \u2014 559 in California and 7,067 \u2014 were accurate. News reports at the time cited those figures from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nThat means New York had more than 12 times as many coronavirus deaths, even though its population is only about one-half that of California.\n\nThink of herd immunity as being a situation in which so many people \u2014 above 50% to perhaps 70% \u2014 are immune to a virus that it essentially stops spreading.\n\nIt occurs when enough people in a community become immune through vaccination and/or prior illness, making the spread of the disease from person to person unlikely, the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology says.\n\nThe theory is that once many people develop immunity, the virus will eventually stop spreading to people who haven\u2019t yet caught it.\n\nBased on testing, even hard-hit Wuhan, China, where the virus was first detected Dec. 31, 2019, isn\u2019t close to achieving herd immunity, the Wall Street Journal reported on April 16, 2020.\n\nAnd in the days after the Facebook post, California Gov. Gavin Newsom talked about herd immunity as an aspiration for his state, not as something that has spared it.\n\nThe Facebook post argues that it makes sense that California would have herd immunity because so many people travel there from China. It alludes to a Stanford University study as evidence.\n\nThat study, which tested for coronavirus antibodies among 3,300 people in Santa Clara County, Calif., on April 3 and 4, 2020, was aimed at determining how many people in the county had unknowingly been infected with the virus, but didn\u2019t become seriously sick.\n\nNewsom said the project would show \"how far away we are from herd immunity.\"\n\nThe study concluded that the infection is much more widespread than indicated by the number of confirmed cases \u2014 an estimated 48,000 to 81,000 people were infected in the county by early April, 50 to 85 times more than the number of confirmed cases. That\u2019s likely due to several factors, including early spread, lack of systematic testing, and asymptomatic or lightly symptomatic cases that were previously undetected, the study said.\n\nBut the study\u2019s findings are not evidence that California has herd immunity, Dr. David Hamer, an expert on infectious diseases and global health and medicine professor at Boston University, told PolitiFact.\n\nExperts told PolitiFact that, because relatively little COVID-19 testing has been done, there simply is no evidence of herd immunity for COVID-19.\n\n\"We just don't have the testing data yet to determine who is protected. So, we are still not there in terms of declaring herd immunity,\" said Melissa Brown, professor of microbiology/immunology at Northwestern University.\n\nStephen Morse, professor of epidemiology at Columbia University in New York, agreed.\n\n\"Since almost all of the testing is done only on sick (symptomatic) people, presumably due to limitations in testing capacity, and only a very few counties are testing more widely, we don\u2019t know the level of immunity in either California or New York,\" he said. \"Therefore, we can\u2019t say anything about herd immunity, as we simply don\u2019t know.\"\n\nWhile the federal and state governments are building up their testing capabilities, \"it\u2019s not clear how good all these tests are,\" said Hamer. \"And we don\u2019t have a clearly defined test to tell whether a person has had the disease\" and also has antibodies to protect from getting COVID-19 again.\n\nAs a number of news reports have suggested, experts also told us that one explanation for California\u2019s lower death toll is that it adopted stay-at-home orders and other responses before New York did.\n\nA widely shared post on Facebook claims herd immunity is probably why California has far fewer COVID-19 deaths than New York.\n\nExperts say that with relatively little testing having been done, there is no evidence to indicate that herd immunity explains the large gap in coronavirus deaths in the two states.", "lang": "en"}
