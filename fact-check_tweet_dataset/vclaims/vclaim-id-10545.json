This includes violence by partners and family members, as well as other types of abuse such as coercive and controlling behaviour. The figures also include stalking by any person, including but not limited to partners and family members.\n\nPartners, ex-partners, or family members were the principal suspect in the killing of 99 women in 2014/15, which works out at just under two women a week. These women made up 60% of the 165 killed in total that year.\n\nThe equivalent figure for men was 43 out of 299 killings in total. So the number of people\u2014men and women\u2014killed by partners, exes, and family members is 2.7 a week on average.\n\nA note of caution on those figures. Killings could include those perpetrated by an 'emotional rival' of the victim\u2014for example if a victim was involved in an affair and was killed by their lover's partner.", "lang": "en"}
