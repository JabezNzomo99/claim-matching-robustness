Ram Singh in PM Modi\u2019s speech referred to Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh who has been convicted of raping two of his followers. This case started in 2002 when based on an anonymous letter, CBI filed an FIR in 2002. In 2007, the CBI filed its chargesheet in the special court at Ambala after having located the victims. In 2008, the CBI court ordered framing of charges of rape against Gurmeet Ram Rahim. When Modiji saluted Gurmeet Ram Rahim, he was well aware of the rape charges and yet he chose to make him an icon of the land. Haryana elections were to be held on Oct 15th, 2014 and BJP needed the support of spiritual group Dera Sacha Sauda which has a huge clout. Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh is the head of Dera Sacha Sauda.\n\nBJP won the Haryana elections and Manohar Lal Khattar was elected as the Chief Minister. He assumed office on 26th October, 2014. On 12th November, 2014, 18 BJP MLAs/Ministers led by BJP\u2019s Haryana election incharge Kailash Vijayvargiya paid a visit to Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh to seek his blessings.\n\nSubsequently, Dera Sacha Sauda extended support to BJP in Delhi elections in February 2015 and Punjab elections in Feb 2017.\n\nOther than the Chief Minister of Haryana, Haryana Governor Kaptan Singh Solanki, Haryana BJP President Subhash Barala have also expressed gratitude towards Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh.\n\nMinisters of Haryana Government have also donated a sum total of 1.12 crores towards Dera Sacha Sauda at various points of time including Education Minister Ram Bilas Sharma donating 51 lakhs, Sports Minister Anil Vij donating 50 lakhs and Manish Gover donating 11 lakhs.\n\nWhen Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh\u2019s film Jattu Engineer was released, Haryana Govt declared it tax free.\n\nOther than leaders in Haryana BJP, BJP leaders and spokespersons from other states have also expressed their happiness about being in company of Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh. They\u2019ve often attended the functions for his atrocious films while beaming happily for the camera.\n\nSome BJP leaders now embarrassed about their previous association with Gurmeet Ram Rahim have started deleting their tweets. P Murlidhar Rao who is the National General Secretary of BJP deleted the following tweet.\n\nThe attempts to get in the good books of a rape accused guru is not limited to BJP. In the past, Congress has also reportedly tried to woo Dera Sacha Sauda in 2007 and 2012.\n\nEven after the conviction and arrest of Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, BJP leaders continue to defend him. BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj somehow believes that if a person has a huge number of devotees, the evidence presented in a court of law based on which a person has been convicted is not valid and that one proven accusation of rape is not enough.\n\nAfter Punjab and Haryana high court passed an order to seize properties of Dera Sacha Sauda to pay for the damages by its rampaging followers, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy also put out a tweet claiming that there\u2019s a conspiracy against Sadhus as part of which their properties are being grabbed by sending them to Jail.\n\nFurther more, as reported by NDTV, CM\u2019s office issued a statement claiming that the violence was the handiwork of certain anti-social elements who got mixed up with the followers of Dera Sacha Sauda thus shying away from putting direct blame on the followers. However, DGP Haryana in a press conference stated that weapons were found from the cars of Dera followers.\n\nThus, self styled godmen continue to call the shots in Indian politics. Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh may be friendlier with BJP at the moment, but he\u2019s been friends with Congress in the past. Chandraswami who was investigated in several financial scams was reportedly the spiritual advisor to former Prime Minister PV Narsimha Rao. Just a month before 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Congress President Sonia Gandhi met Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid Syed Ahmed Bukhari to seek support, Shahi Imam being one of the country\u2019s most prominent religious Muslim leaders. Despite Sri Sri Ravi Shankar refusing to pay the fine of 5 crores ordered by National Green Tribunal for damage to Yamuna Plains due to Art of Living\u2019s World Cultural Festival, Narendra Modi inaugurated the event and many other BJP leaders came out in support of Sri Sri. Arvind Kejriwal had also come out in support of Art Of Living during this phase. Till the time, these religious leaders continue to influence Indian politics, political parties talking about secularism means zilch.", "lang": "en"}
