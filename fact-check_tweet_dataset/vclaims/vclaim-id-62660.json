Kym Kemp\u2019s Redheaded Blackbelt blog features the original photograph, along with a snapshot of another demonstrator holding the same sign.\n\nGretha Stenger, the woman in the red scarf pictured above, apologized afterwards and maintained that the sign was not hers and had been handed to her:\n\nGretha Stenger held the sign at a protest in front of the Humboldt County courthouse, where she was photographed for a post in Redheaded Blackbelt, the community news blog in Southern Humboldt. In a statement, Stenger apologized for the image, which was shared thousands of times on Twitter and garnered hundreds of reactions on Facebook from people criticizing the sign\u2019s message. Stenger said the sign was not hers but handed to her by another protester at the demonstration. \u201cHolding that sign up at the lockdown protest was a grave mistake and I ask forgiveness from all those who I have caused pain. As I had no sign of my own, it was handed to me by another protester and a photographer took the picture before I considered the racist implications. My intent was to take a stand for the freedom of all human persons and I mistakenly held a sign that conveyed the opposite. Please know that I respect the dignity of all people and I sincerely regret any suffering it has caused.\u201d\n\nWe note that the function of a muzzle is to prevent the wearer from being able to talk, bite, and or eat, none of which is precluded (literally or figuratively) by the wearing of a face mask used to minimize the transmission of infection.", "lang": "en"}
