The text also says: \"Virus dies in 4 days. 5th day you are Corona Negative.\"\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), the incubation period or the time between catching the virus and the manifestation of symptoms of the disease alone ranges from 1-14 days, most commonly around 5 days.\n\n\"Using available preliminary data, the median time from onset to clinical recovery for mild cases is approximately 2 weeks and is 3-6 weeks for patients with severe or critical disease. Preliminary data suggests that the time period from onset to the development of severe disease, including hypoxia, is 1 week. Among patients who have died, the time from symptom onset to outcome ranges from 2-8 weeks,\" the report said.\n\nA study entitled, \"Epidemiological and Clinical Aspects of COVID-19; a Narrative Review\" said that in case studies conducted outside of mainland China, the period of the onset of symptoms to recovery lasted around 22 days. Meanwhile, the average period of the onset of symptoms to death ranges from 20 to 22 days.\n\nMeanwhile, WHO also said that while some Western, traditional, or home remedies may alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that any current medicine is able to prevent or cure the disease. Furthermore, WHO does not recommend self-medication using any drug for COVID-19.", "lang": "en"}
