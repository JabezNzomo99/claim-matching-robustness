The website consists of statements from sources such as the \u201cLugansk People\u2019s Republic People\u2019s Militia press service\u201d and the \u201cLugansk People\u2019s Republic Healthcare ministry\u201d.\n\nLuhansk is a region of Ukraine, which declared itself independent after the 2014 uprising. The Foreign & Commonwealth Office advises against travel there because of \u201congoing clashes between Ukrainian armed forces and Russian-backed armed separatists\u201d.\n\nThe article claims that: \u201cThe total of 15 volunteers were exposed to the vaccine and medication produced by Americal [sic] virologists in the Kharkov region. Eight of the volunteers were soon transferred to intensive care units, three were put on ventilation.\u201d\n\nNone of this is true. Ukrainian fact checking website Stop Fake was told by head of Ukraine\u2019s Armed Forces Medical Service Corps media relations Oleksiy Mazepa, that the story is fake.\n\nMr Mazepa also told fact checkers at AFP: \u201cThere are no tests with our soldiers. This is obvious fake news. This is the way Russian propaganda works.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ukraine\u2019s military, as of 21 August, there had been 1,365 Covid-19 cases in the military, and of those there were six deaths.", "lang": "en"}
