The claim is false; the video has circulated in Dutch media reports about a disturbance at a mosque in Rotterdam in which police arrested a man after he allegedly attacked them.\n\nThe video was published in this Facebook post on December 7, 2019. It has been shared more than 460 times.\n\nThe two-minute and six-second video shows four police officers with a dog arresting a man inside a mosque.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Indonesian-language caption translates in English as: \u201cA blasphemy to the religion of Islam has happened again. A mosque, the holy house of God, is being degraded by infidels the enemy of God in Norway. For those of you who are not aware. Apparently the government of Norway has started to burn the Koran. A mosque imam was standing outside the mosque offering free Korans to anyone who needs it. And when the imam was reading the Koran, police officers entered the mosque with their shoes on and a dog. He asked them to remove their shoes and take the dog out of the mosque to protect the house of God. The police and the dog attacked and hit him.\n\n\u201cThe person who speaks in the video asks for the video to be shared and to make the incident known by the world. God is great. Oh God, help those who help your religion and exterminate those who want to exterminate your religion and Muslims! Amen.\u201d\n\nThe same video was also shared with a similar claim here and here on Facebook; here on Twitter and here on YouTube, where it has been viewed almost 800 times.\n\nThe video was also shared in Arabic language here and here with the same claim.\n\nIt was also shared in English here and here with a claim that the footage shows Norwegian police officers arresting someone who recited the Koran in a mosque, and here with a claim that Norwegian police entered a mosque to arrest a Muslim.\n\nThe claims are false; the video has circulated in Dutch media reports about a man who was arrested for allegedly attacking police officers during a disturbance at a mosque in Rotterdam. The reports contained no reference to the man being arrested for reciting the Koran.\n\nA reverse image search and a keyword search on Google found the same two-minute, six-second video published on Facebook here on October 6, 2019.\n\nThe Dutch-language caption translates to English as: \u201cPolice officers with a police dog detained a worshipper at Essalaam Mosque in Rotterdam. On September 17, 2019, the police received a message from the leadership of the mosque that they wanted to expel a man causing a disturbance. The four police officers had to use a police dog to overpower the man. The man\u2019s family were also afraid to him. The 43-year-old Rotterdam resident is still in detention.\u201d\n\nMultiple news reports in Dutch have also covered the incident, for example this October 4, 2019, report by Dutch-language daily newspaper De Telegraaf.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of De Telegraaf\u2019s report:\n\nThe report\u2019s headline translates to English as: \u201cOfficers with police dog overpower man in mosque\u201d.\n\nThe sub-headline reads in English as: \u201cImages circulating on the internet show an arrest in the Rotterdam Essalam mosque in Rotterdam South. Four officers and a police dog are attacked by a man sitting in a corner of a room.\u201d\n\nThe first paragraph of the report reads: \u201cOn September 17, the police were called by the mosque because a man inside the Islamic prayer house on Vredesplein was making trouble, a police spokesperson told De Telegraaf. Officers went to the mosque with a dog. The board wanted him to go. The man's family are also afraid of him. He then attacked the officers. He was arrested and is still in detention, the spokesman said.\u201d\n\nThe man is 43 years old and he is from Rotterdam, the report said.\n\nDe Telegraaf\u2019s report also includes the same video of the incident.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison between the video in the misleading post and the video posted by De Telegraaf:\n\nEssalam Mosque is located in the Dutch city of Rotterdam. Here is the interior of the mosque\u2019s hall captured in a Google user's photo tagged at the mosque's location on Google Maps. It matches the interior seen in the footage.\n\nOther news organisations also reported the incident in the video, for example this report by Dutch broadcaster WNL Vandaag on October 4, 2019.", "lang": "en"}
