He did speak before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee multiple times \u2013 first when being considered for the cabinet position and again in October 2017.\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that Tillerson ever made the remark attributed to him in the meme. Had he done so, it would have been widely covered by the media, yet there is no record of it online.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing, Tillerson said that while the U.S. should seek common ground with Russia, it must remain \u201cclear eyed\u201d about its relationship with the geopolitical adversary.\n\n\u201cWhere important differences remain, we should be steadfast in defending the interest of America and her allies,\u201d he said in January 2017. \u201cRussia must know that we will be accountable to our commitments and those of our allies and that Russia must be held to account for its actions.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
