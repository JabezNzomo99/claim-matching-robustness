In a comment beneath the video, the Facebook user who posted it makes the claim: \u201cThis was today\u201d.\n\nThis information is false. The incident in the video took place when police were called to what was reported as a \u201clarge disturbance\u201d in Scunthorpe, northern England, in May 2019.\n\nScreen grabs from the video posted to Facebook can be seen in a local newspaper report (here).\n\nThe first screen grab in the article matches the scene at the 4:41 timecode on the Facebook video. The second screen grab appears at 3.11 in the video and the third screen grab appears at 3.39.\n\nOn April 15, 2020, the date the video was published to Facebook, the Grimsby Telegraph published a report about an April 12 incident in Scunthorpe in which Humberside Police had to intervene after a lockdown party spilled into the street (here) . This incident occurred on a different street to the 2019 disturbance.\n\nFalse. The video shows police responding to an incident in Scunthorpe that occurred in May 2019.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
