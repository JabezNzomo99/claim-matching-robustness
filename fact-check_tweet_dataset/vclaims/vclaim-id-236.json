The claim is false.\n\nThe Reuters Fact Check team previously debunked a claim that Bill Gates planned to launch microchip skin implants to fight the coronavirus ( here ). The claim emerged after a Reddit Q&A in which Gates mentioned foreseeing the use of \u201cdigital certificates\u201d to show who has been tested for COVID-19 or who has recovered from the disease ( here ).\n\nMost of the iterations of this claim misleadingly refer to \u201cquantum dot dye\u201d technology, which was founded by the Gates Foundation. Kevin McHugh, one of the lead authors of the \u201cquantum dot dye\u201d research paper, confirmed to Reuters this technology is not a microchip or human implantable capsule. Instead, it is similar to a tattoo, which would help provide up-to-date patient vaccine records for professionals in places lacking medical records.\n\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told Reuters via email that: \u201cThe reference to \u2018digital certificates\u2019 relates to efforts to create an open source digital platform with the goal of expanding access to safe, home-based testing.\u201d\n\nReuters found no evidence of any statement given by Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID, part of National Institutes of Health), regarding vaccination certificates.\n\nThe viral posts might stem from a CNN interview in which Dr Fauci said the idea of Americans carrying \u201ccertificates of immunity\u201d in the future is \u201cpossible\u201d. He added that this \u201cmight have some merit in certain circumstance\u201d (at the 2:48 mark here ).\n\nAccording to Dr Fauci, these certificates would identify those who have tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies, rather than a potential vaccine. He confirmed these are already being discussed by the White House coronavirus task force and would be useful for vulnerable people and health workers ( here ).\n\nWhile the U.S. Government certainly appears to be considering \u201ccertificates of immunity\u201d, as of May 4, 2020, Reuters did not find evidence suggesting Fauci thought it compulsory that Americans would have to carry immunity certificates in the future.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has recently warned governments against issuing \u201cimmunity passports\u201d as there is no evidence that recovered patients cannot be reinfected ( here ). In late April, Chile confirmed it will move forward with coronavirus \u201crelease certificates\u201d for recovered coronavirus patients, but that these documents will not certify immunity ( https:// www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-chile/in-reversal-chile-says-coronavirus-release-certificates-will-not-prove-immunity-idUSKBN22B2ZY ).\n\nFalse. Bill Gates foresees the use of \u201cdigital certificates\u201d with health records but did not say these would be in the form of microchip implants. Dr. Fauci has accepted the possibility of Americans carrying \u201ccertificates of immunity\u201d in the future, not vaccination certificates.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
