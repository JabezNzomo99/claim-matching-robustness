Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Photos of an Indian Air Force (IAF) jet shot down by Nepal. Fact: The posted photos are old. While one photo is related to Libya, the other one shows IAF\u2019s Mirage-2000 fighter which crashed in Bengaluru in 2019. Also, the Press Information Bureau (PIB) \u2013 India has clarified that the post is fake. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image was run through Google Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found in an article published in 2011. In the article, the image credit is given to \u2018Associated Press\u2019. So, when searched on the \u2018AP Images\u2019 website, the full version of the photo was found. In the description of the photo, it is written that \u2018a pilot ejects from the cockpit of a doomed warplane after it was shot down over the outskirts of Benghazi, eastern Libya, Saturday, March 19, 2011.\u2019 So, the photo is old and not related to India.\n\nThis photo can be found in an article published by \u2018The Statesman\u2019 in February 2019. In the description of the photo, it can be read that the photo shows \u2018the site where Indian Air Force\u2019s (IAF) Mirage-2000 fighter crashed at a military airport in the Bengaluru\u2019s eastern suburb on Feb 1, 2019\u2019. The same photo can be also found in the \u2018Deccan Herald\u2019 article. So, the plane in the photo was not shot down by Nepal or any other country.\n\nAlso, the Press Information Bureau (PIB) \u2013 India has clarified that the post is fake and \u2018no such claimed action has been conducted by Indian airforce on any neighbouring country.\u2019\n\nTo sum it up, old and unrelated images falsely shared as \u2018Indian Air Force (IAF) jet shot down by Nepal\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
