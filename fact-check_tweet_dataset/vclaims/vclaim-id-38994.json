No, that's not true: the post was published by a Facebook page named \"Covid19\", which used the official CDC logo. But the page was created only a few days ago, and it has no relation with the official CDC page.\n\nThe post in question (archived here and in Facebook's ad library) was apparently published on March 2, 2020. It showed a screenshot of what looks like an earlier sponsored post by a page with the same name that showed a picture of an Asian-looking young man in a car and the text:\n\nBreaking News! Authority is looking for this male in his early 20's localed in\n\nthe east bay. He was put in for mandatory quarantine after arrival from Hong\n\nKong. He refused and has escaped the us base quarantine. We need your\n\nhelp to flnd him before the spread ofhe deadly virus.\n\nLead Stories was unable to locate the sponsored post shown in the screenshot and reverse image searching the photo returned no results.\n\nHowever the page transparency information for the Covid19 Facebook page shows it had been created recently, on March 2, 2020:\n\nThe real CDC Facebook page makes no mention of any \"wanted\" patients on the run. It also doesn't mention anything about mandatory quarantines. It does however show several useful tips for protecting yourself from COVID-19:\n\nLead Stories has reported the fraudulent page to Facebook via the \"Find Support or Report Page\" button in the transparency popup that appears if you click \"See More\" in the Page Transparency sidebar widget:\n\nWe encourage our readers to do the same with any fraudulent pages they spot.\n\nThere is a lot of misinformation online about the novel coronavirus.
