Gavin Newsom \u201chas no legal authority\u201d to mandate residents wear face masks.\n\nThe California Emergency Services Act gives Newsom broad authority to issue health mandates during a state of emergency such as the coronavirus pandemic. Legal experts said the governor has the power to mandate California residents wear face coverings.\n\nNewsom announced on June 18 that California residents are required to wear face coverings in \u201chigh-risk settings\u201d as some counties began to ease restrictions meant to curb the spread of the new coronavirus, according to NPR. Michigan, New York and Delaware, among other states, already have statewide mask orders in place, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe order requires people to wear face coverings when in line or inside indoor public spaces, in health care settings, while waiting for or riding public transportation, in outdoor spaces where maintaining six feet of distance is not feasible and in most workplaces, among other settings.\n\nPeople who are exempt from the mandate include children under the age of two, individuals with medical, mental health or developmental disabilities that prevents them from wearing masks and those eating or drinking in restaurants where social distancing is possible, according to NPR.\n\nSome social media users have questioned the legality of such a mandate, with one viral video caption reading, \u201cContrary to the LA Times story, Newsom did NOT issue any mandatory mask orders in CA! (He has no legal authority to do so.)\u201d (RELATED: Viral Post Claims California Is Registering 3 Million Noncitizens To Vote)\n\nKate Folmar, a spokesperson for the state\u2019s Health and Human Agency, told PolitiFact that \u201cthe State Legislature has given the Governor broad authority to respond to state emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic\u201d through the California Emergency Services Act. Newsom declared a state of emergency, making that law applicable, on March 4.\n\n\u201cThe Governor may make, amend, and rescind orders and regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter,\u201d reads section 8567 of the California Emergency Services Act. \u201cThe orders and regulations shall have the force and effect of law.\u201d\n\nThat same executive order, which required Californians to heed public health guidelines, grants the state the ability to enforce the state\u2019s Department of Public Health rules, according to the Sacramento Bee. While the rule change was technically termed \u201cguidance,\u201d the California Department of Health told the Daily Caller News Foundation in an email that the mask mandate \u201cis enforceable if necessary, as a misdemeanor carrying a potential financial penalty and other penalties.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the authority under which the governor declared an emergency on March 4,\u201d Leslie Jacobs, who teaches constitutional law at McGeorge School of Law, told PolitiFact. \u201cThat transfers all the authority of the state to the governor, to the extent necessary, to address the COVID emergency.\u201d\n\nWilliam Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the chair of their governance studies program, agreed Newsom\u2019s face mask mandate was within his power as governor.\n\n\u201cAs a constitutional matter, the states have the principal responsibility for ensuring public health and safety,\u201d Galston told the DCNF in an email. \u201cMost states \u2013 including California \u2013 have enacted statutes giving governors broad executive authority to do so. In my judgment, this is not a close legal call.\u201d\n\nThe state health and safety code allows the California Department of Public Health to \u201ctake measures as are necessary to ascertain the nature of the disease and prevent its spread\u201d to prevent and control the spread of contagious, infectious or communicable disease, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Public Health would appear to have sufficient authority to direct the public to wear masks in order to prevent the pandemic\u2019s spread,\u201d said former state appellate court Judge Daniel M. Kolkey to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nWalter Olson, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, told the DCNF that California law \u201cgives the state government very broad public health powers.\u201d (RELATED: Is It Illegal To Wear A Face Mask While Legally Caryying A Concealed Weapon In North Carolina?)\n\n\u201cThere are always going to be some avenues for legal challenge,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cFor example, litigants could argue that a state of emergency has been kept in effect even though the emergency is over, or that an order is irrational because it doesn\u2019t actually reduce disease transmission.\u201d\n\nBut Olson cast doubt on the strength of such arguments, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think those arguments would be very successful with judges under current conditions.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
