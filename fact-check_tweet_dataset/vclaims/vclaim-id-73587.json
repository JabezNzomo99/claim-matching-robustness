No, that's not true. Owens never even had a show on the network. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to mislead Trump supporters and Republicans into sharing made up stories that are clearly marked as satire when you actually click them. Articles from the site are frequently copied by foreign-run fake news websites. The people liking and sharing these stories are enriching foreign website operators or a liberal from Maine via the ad revenue generated with the content which is probably not what they expected or wanted.\n\nThe satirical story appeared first as an article published by Tater Force One on August 19, 2020 titled \"Candace Owens Fired After Calling Kamala 'Fake Black'\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nOne of the most popular pundits on cable news has been unceremoniously fired this week, after her parent network, One America News, was deluged with calls charging her with racism and \"hate speech.\" During a segment of her show critiquing the Democratic national convention, the dusky conservative spitfire referred to Vice Presidential candidate Kamala Harris as a \"fake black.\" Owens is no stranger to controversy, previously angering American Jews and Israelis with favorable talk about Adolf Hitler. The fiery former pornography fluffer told Sandy Batt of Inside Trumptards magazine that her comments were strictly opinion and that OAN's purpose isn't news, but simply fictional entertainment for those even too stupid for Fox News.\n\nOwens never had a show on One America News (she has one on PragerU) and because of that she obviously never could have called Kamala Harris a \"fake black\" on it. None of the other details of the story are true either (except the remark about being no stranger to controversy). Everything in the story was published under a category named \"Celebrity Fan Fiction\" on a site with a \"Satire\" logo in the header and subheader that reads \"Satirical Confirmation Bias From America's Last Line of Defense\".\n\nThe site is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run by self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. He runs several websites and Facebook pages with visible satire disclaimers everywhere. They mostly publish made-up stories with headlines specifically created to trigger Republicans, conservatives and evangelical Christians into angrily sharing or commenting on the story on Facebook without actually reading the full article, exposing them to mockery and ridicule by fans of the sites and pages.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who omit the satire disclaimer and other hints the stories are fake. One of the most persistent networks of such sites is run by a man from Pakistan named Kashif Shahzad Khokhar (aka \"DashiKashi\") who has spammed hundreds of such stolen stories into conservative and right-wing Facebook pages in order to profit from the ad revenue.\n\nWhen fact checkers point this out to the people liking and sharing these copycat stories some of them get mad at the fact checkers instead of directing their anger at the foreign spammers or the liberal satire writers. Others send a polite \"thank you\" note, which is much appreciated.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes taterforceone.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
