This video has been circulated online over the years with the claim that it shows the aftermath of a tsunami in China. A Facebook page titled \u2018Animesh Digital\u2019 recently shared this video and wrote, \u201cChina betrayed the world by sending the virus, now the Almighty will betray it.\u201d\n\nThe same caption has been used to share the video on Facebook.\n\nSome Twitter users also shared this clip claiming that this tsunami had hit China. Twitter user @GaneshKGavli5 posted the video with the Marathi caption, \u201cDue to heavy rains, three dams collapsed and caused floods in China. See for yourself the kind of lesson China has got. A country which made itself a superpower through inhuman and selfish means. See the terror of this terrible flood. In the end, you will reap what you sow.\u201d\n\nSome of our readers also sent requests to fact-check this video on the official Alt News Android app.\n\nAlt News had also fact checked this video in 2018. It was then viral as visuals from the Kerala floods.\n\nWhen we did a Google search using the keywords \u2018Japan Tsunami\u2019, we came across quite a few videos on YouTube. One of these was titled \u2018TSUNAMI JAPAN 3.11/2011\u2019. This is the video that is currently going viral and being passed off as floods in China. The clip was uploaded by Takuro Suzuki on December 18, 2011, and has received over 43 lakh views. The video description reads, \u201c\u2018Ishinomaki Tidal Wave\u2019 East Japan\u2019s Earthquake. Photo of Ishinomaki-shi, Miyagi. Don\u2019t get stuck in such a bad condition. It\u2019s impossible. I\u2019m taking this picture from the roof of Ishinomaki Gas (Company).\u201d\n\nAnother verified YouTube channel called FNN311 had also uploaded this video on October 25, 2012. The video description mentions that this is a video of a tsunami that occurred on March 11, 2011, in Ishinomaki, Japan. It had been recorded by an employee from a terrace near the port. FNN 311 is a Japanese news network. The channel has also included more information about the tsunami and additional links in the description.\n\nIn this video, a number of cylindrical and spherical structures can be seen between the 3:02 and 3:12 minute mark. A photo of the same location generated by Google Maps\u2019 Street View in May 2013 is shown below. At present, though, there have been considerable changes in the structure and appearance of the place.\n\nTherefore, social media users are sharing a video of the tsunami that struck Japan about a decade ago. This video had previously also been falsely circulated two years ago as a flood in Kerala. The video is completely unrelated to China and was actually taken in Japan.", "lang": "en"}
