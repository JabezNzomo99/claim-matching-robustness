Yousafzai and her father are the co-founders of the Malala Fund, an organization dedicated to promoting girls\u2019 education worldwide.\n\nThe photo in the Facebook post shows Yousafzai posing with a young man, allegedly the son of an Israeli government official. The caption reads, \u201cMalala with son of Israeli Defense Minister, working for education in Pakistan with first and most important lesson.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Times of Israel published a photo in 2019 of Israeli Minister of Defense Benny Gantz with his sons that shows his children bear little resemblance to the young man pictured with Yousafzai. In reality, the young man is Yousafzai\u2019s brother Khushal.\n\nYousafzai\u2019s brothers, Khushal and Atal, are identified in a different photo featured in an April 28 article written by their father that was published by the U.K. newspaper The Sunday Times. The New York Times also published an image of Yousafzai celebrating her graduation from Oxford University with her family that shows the same people identified in her father\u2019s article. Both photos show the same young man that is in the image being shared.\n\nThe image in question was first shared by Yousafzai on July 12, her 23rd birthday, in a tweet that says, \u201cChapter 23! Ready for a quarter-life crisis. Thank you so much to everyone for all the good wishes.\u201d (RELATED: Hoax Letter Claims Missouri Public School Students Must Repeat The School Year Due To COVID-19 Closures)\n\nThis is not the first time social media users have misidentified a man pictured with Yousafzai as Gantz\u2019s son. This month, AFP Fact Check debunked one such post that actually showed the Nobel laureate alongside Pakistani cricket player Faisal Iqbal.", "lang": "en"}
