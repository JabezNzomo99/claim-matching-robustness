Despite being the product of a Moscow-born author, the \u201cRussophobia\u201d criticism took on new life when a Ukrainian-Maltese video game developer designed the Metro Exodus computer game.\n\nNoting on February 18 that Metro Exodus had become an international best seller, Rossiya-24 presenter Alexey Kazakov said it was not \u201cunimportant\u201d that the game was developed by Ukrainians, who had \u201capparently gotten carried away with their own Maidan reality\u201d -- a reference to the 2013 Euromaidan protest movement.\n\nKazakov added that the game\u2019s developers had \u201calso mocked Muscovites,\u201d quoting them as saying residents of the Russian capital didn\u2019t know that \u201cpeople also live\u201d outside Moscow \u201camid the ruins and hordes.\"\n\n\u201cAs the saying goes, it\u2019s a tall tale topped with Russophobia,\u201d Kazakov said, noting how users can earn \"Decommunization\" points through the destruction of Vladimir Lenin statues.\n\nKazakov said that \u201cno small number\u201d of Russians had taken to social media to voice their disappointment with the game, while Westerners were \u201cdelighted\u201d with that the game\u2019s \u201cideology\u201d proved a perfect fit.\n\nGlukhovsky told the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta that he was flattered Rossiya-24 had put a spotlight on his work, saying he\u2019d taken satisfaction in \u201cstirring up a hornets\u2019 nest.\u201d\n\nGlukhovsky called the destruction of the Lenin statue an \u201cinsignificant\u201d episode in the game in the context of its entire plot.\n\n\u201cIn the world of Metro, all external signals are muffled,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cIn this light, the episode with the unfortunate Lenin... Well, think! He's basically an inhuman cannibal. At the end of the day, why not shatter [Lenin\u2019s] monument?\u201d\n\nGlukhovsky added he has had a long working relationship with 4A Games and his political convictions coincide with those of the developers.\n\nThis is not the first time the game series has come under fire for alleged Russophobia.\n\nA promotional poster for the game spelled \u2018\u2019Russia\u2019\u2019 with all lower-case Russian letters, prompting claims the typographical error was instance of Russophobia, noted the Ostrag gaming portal.\n\nIn a 2013 edition of the game, Metro 2033: Last Light, gamers encounter the phrase \u201cROISSYA VPERDE\u201d \u2013 a reference to a popular Russian internet meme -- on the \u2018\u2019Nightfall\u2019\u2019 level of the game (that phrase is a crude-misspelling of Rossiya Vpered! -- Russia, Forward!)\n\nWhether that reference was intended derisively or was merely an \u201cEaster egg\u201d (a hidden video game feature) referencing internet meme culture among Russian-language gamers is unknown.\n\nBut Kazakov\u2019s accusation that targeting a Lenin statue is a manifestation of Russophobia has a far more topical political bent.\n\nIn April 2015, Ukraine initiated a decommunization process, under which Communist symbols were outlawed, communist-era monuments (excluding those related to World War II) were targeted for removal, streets and public spaces were renamed and the Justice Ministry was authorized to block the Communist Party from participating in elections.\n\nMost recently, Russian state media have attacked the renaming of cities and regions in Ukraine to pre-Soviet names under Law of Ukraine No. 317-VIII \"On condemning Communist and National-Socialist (Nazi) totalitarian regimes in Ukraine and banning propaganda of their symbols.\u201d\n\nAFP noted that the fate of myriad Lenin statues was a component in the Maidan protests of 2013 that led to the ouster of Ukraine\u2019s then pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych.\n\nNostalgia for the Soviet past and attempts to conceptualize the Russian-backed war in eastern Ukraine as an extension of World War II have been component features of the pro-separatist disinformation campaign in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe late pro-Russian separatist leader Alexander Zakharchenko, for example, told AFP that \u201cthe USSR was a great country.\u201d\n\nIn December 2018, a Levada Center survey found that 66% of Russians regretted the Soviet breakup \u2013 a 15-year high.\n\nIronically, Lenin himself derided what he called \u201cgreat Russian chauvinism,\u201d leading to a policy of korenizatsiya (\u201cputting down roots\u201d) that sought to curtail Russian linguistic and cultural domination in other Soviet republics.\n\nIn 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin slammed Lenin for this policy, saying it \u201cplanted an atomic bomb under the building that is called Russia which later exploded.\u201d\n\nIronically, many of Lenin\u2019s policies have made him a lighting road for Russia\u2019s far right.\n\nRussian nationalist firebrand Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the misleadingly-named Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, decried Lenin in the State Duma as a \u201cRussophobe,\u201d as Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev could be seen smirking behind him.\n\nRussian white nationalist blogger Anatoly Karlin derided Lenin as \u201ca sadist, a Russophobe and a tyrant\u201d in an extensive polemic echoing a commonly held view among similar ideologues.\n\nIn this context, equating criticism of Lenin to Russophobia is inconsistent with fringe or even mainstream ideological discourse in Russia.\n\nPoygraph.info therefore finds Kazakhov\u2019s claims the video game is Russophobic to be misleading.", "lang": "en"}
