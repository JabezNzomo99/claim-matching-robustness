Kavanaugh has denied the allegations. Ford has been the subject of numerous viral social media posts that falsely suggest she is associated with prominent Democrats.\n\nThis particular photo was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

The sharer notes that the picture \"keeps disappearing from my timeline\" and encourages others to take their own photos of the image and share it -- which appears to be exactly what happened in the post that, when we reviewed it, had generated nearly 362,000 shares.\n\nIn reality, the image is a photo of Clinton and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. Gillibrand tweeted the picture from her official Twitter account on July 25, 2016, on the first day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.\n\nWe rate this viral post Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
