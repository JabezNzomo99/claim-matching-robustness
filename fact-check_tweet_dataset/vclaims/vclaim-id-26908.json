No, that's not true: the story was made up by a Canadian entertainment website that makes a living by publishing fictional stories often involving weird crimes, bizarre sex acts or strange accidents. It is not real. The hoax was published in 2015 and got endlessly copied by other sites ever since. It recently resurfaced again.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by World News Daily Report on December 16, 2015 titled \"Indonesia: Zoo Keeper Accused of Impregnating Female Orangutan\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nSurabaya | A zoo keeper at Indonesia's Surabaya zoo has been arrested and charged with sexual assault on a number of animals and even, strangely enough, of impregnating a female orangutan, reports the Kalimantan Press this morning. The 38-year-old zoo keeper was filmed in full action by a series of hidden cameras put in place by the zoo's security officials after doubts emerged about the man's devious actions towards the zoo animals. \"Some animals seemed sexually aroused when it was time to feed them\" explains Akhiroel Yahya, employee of the zoo for 14 years.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail, with no indication it didn't come from a reliable news source:\n\nBut there is no publication named \"Kalimantan Press\" and the picture of the orangutan already appeared in a 2011 news article so it can't have been a photo of an animal made pregnant in 2015:\n\nWho ape all the pies? Orangutan kicks back with a full belly in the midday sun It looks like this orangutan got more than her fair share of the Christmas hamper. Louise Bleakly, 69, snapped the portly primate as she lazed by a tree after over-indulging. The sedentary creature soaked up the midday sun at Taman Safari Park near Jakarta, Indonesia - and was too lazy to even swing on the trees and ropes.\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories.

Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes worldnewsdailyreport.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
