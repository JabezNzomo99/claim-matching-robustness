There were a number of instances where top news organisations ended up disseminating misinformation, wittingly or otherwise. Disturbingly, on numerous occasions, reportage by media outlets ended up furthering the communal divide.\n\nAnkit Kumar Garg, a 31-year old teacher was shot dead on October 1 in Delhi. Soon after the incident, multiple news organisations reported that this was a case of honour killing. The basis of the reports was the accusation by the victim\u2019s family that Ankit was killed by the family of the Muslim girl he was in a relationship with.\n\nSeveral media organisations including Zee News, Aaj Tak, News18, Dainik Bhaskar and Times Now reported that Garg\u2019s murder was a case of honour killing. The language and tone of the reportage was inflammatory.\n\nIt turned out that the motive for the murder was not honour killing. This was confirmed by Delhi police which stated that a BTech student had been arrested for the murder, and the motive was jealousy over the friendship of the victim with a female.\n\nOn October 13, the wife and son of a Gurgaon district judge were shot in broad daylight by their personal security officer (PSO) while on duty. On October 16, the police declared that the sole motive behind the murder was \u201csudden rage\u201d. Several initial media reports had, however, linked the murder to \u201creligious conversion\u201d even before the police concluded its investigation.\n\nThese media reports declared that the accused had pressurised the judge\u2019s family to embrace Christianity, which led to frequent altercations, and the subsequent attack. The basis of these reports was the perpetrator\u2019s spiritual inclination and the multiple statements he gave during police interrogation. Several news organisations like Dainik Bhaskar, Dainik Jagran, One India and Aaj Tak had reported this.\n\nHaryana police clarified that the murder was not linked to the spiritual inclination of the perpetrator. \u201cAfter probing all aspects of the case, we have reached the conclusion that Mahipal left the car unattended when the judge\u2019s wife and son went shopping in Arcadia market, Gurgaon. When he was questioned and rebuked for not returning on time, he shot the duo in a fit of rage,\u201d said DCP (crime) Sumit Kumar in a press conference.\n\nAlthough many media organisations later updated their reports, there was no acknowledgement or clarification regarding the misreporting of the incident.\n\n\u201cNo rape of the girl in Kathua, postmortem report only talks of injuries\u201d screamed the front page of the Hindi newspaper Dainik Jagran on April 20. The article claimed that the post-mortem report of the Kathua incident makes no mention of rape. It stated that there could be other reasons for the injuries that the victim suffered. The report went on to explain that scratches on the thigh could be a result of a fall and the torn hymen could be a result of activities like cycling, swimming, horse riding etc. The article had no mention of other injuries that also point to a possibility of sexual assault.\n\nThe Dainik Jagran report was in contradiction to the post-mortem report of the rape victim of Kathua. Alt News accessed the post-mortem report, in which there was mention of blood on labia, vulval lacerations, vaginal bleeding, hymen not intact and blood marks on thighs and abdomen. Moreover, a subsequent written response by the Board of Doctors of the District Hospital Kathua to the police clearly explained that \u201cinjuries mentioned could be because of any form of sexual assault\u201d.\n\nOn December 3, a policeman was killed in clashes after a mob went on a rampage protesting alleged illegal cow slaughter in Siana tehsil of Bulandshahr district, U.P. The outbreak of violence coincided with the three-day ijtema gathering of Islamic scholars from December 1 to December 3 in Bulandshahr.\n\nSudarshan News chief Suresh Chavhanke tweeted that the violence was linked to the ijtema gathering. In another tweet, Chavhanke referred to the \u2018Tablighi Jamaat\u2019 as the organiser of the Ijtema, adding that it is on the radar of security agencies. Sudarshan News also broadcast a prime time programme on the same.\n\nBulandshahr police clarified via twitter that the violence which shook the town was NOT related in any way to the Ijtema gathering. Replying to Chavhanke\u2019s tweet, police also appealed not to spread misinformation about the violence.\n\nWith the Ram Janmabhoomi issue once again at the forefront of public discourse, certain news organisations in November 2018 reported that \u201cMuslim women\u201d were wholeheartedly supporting the cause of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. For instance, Amar Ujala published an article titled \u2013\u201cWe swear on God, Mandir will be built there: Muslim women come forward, men\u2019s stance unclear (translated).\u201d\n\nIt turned out that these Muslim women who were spearheading this campaign were doing so under the banner of organisations affiliated to the RSS. \u2018Muslim Rashtriya Manch\u2019 and \u2018Rashtriya Ekta Mission\u2019 are platforms under the umbrella of the sangh parivar. This detail was omitted in the report by Amar Ujala, giving the impression that a mass of Muslim women from Meerut had extended their support to the cause of Ram mandir.\n\n6. Misreporting by Sudarshan News about decree passed by mosque against UP police\n\n\u201c\u0936\u0941\u0930\u0942 \u0939\u094b \u0917\u092f\u093e \u0935\u094b \u0938\u092c \u0915\u0941\u091b \u091c\u093f\u0938\u0915\u093e \u0921\u0930 \u0925\u093e. up \u0915\u0940 \u090f\u0915 \u092e\u0938\u094d\u091c\u093f\u0926 \u0938\u0947 \u0906\u092f\u093e \u092b\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0928 \u2013 \u201c\u091f\u0941\u0915\u0921\u093c\u0947 \u091f\u0941\u0915\u0921\u093c\u0947 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0915\u093e\u091f\u0928\u093e \u0939\u0948 @Uppolice \u0935\u093e\u0932\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b\u201d (Everything we were afraid of has started. #up A decree came from a #mosque \u2013 cut them @uppolice into pieces- translated) tweeted Suresh Chavhanke, the editor-in-chief of Sudarshan News channel on July 21, 2018 with an article titled exactly the same, which claimed that a decree against the UP Police has been passed by a mosque in Uttar Pradesh. What followed was an inflammatory article.\n\nBaghpat police, UP had responded via Twitter through a video that explained the details of the incident of a public threat which was given to a police officer over a death caused due to drowning. In a conversation with Alt News, the police rubbished the claim about a decree passed by any mosque against the police. However, there was no clarification or retraction from Sudarshan News.\n\nIn an alleged case of fake encounters, the Uttar Pradesh police on September 21 shot deadtwo purported criminals \u2013 Mustaqeem and Naushad \u2013 in Aligarh\u2019s Harduaganj, and \u2018invited\u2019 media personnel to film the act. Aligarh SP Atul Srivastava later refuted that the encounters were stage-managed.\n\nActivists, journalists and student leaders of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) and Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), including Umar Khalid, visited the kin of the deceased on September 27 to investigate the encounters. The following day, several media outlets reported that Khalid was involved in abducting family members of the alleged criminals. These included Zee News, Dainik Jagran and Jansatta.\n\nThe women had not been abducted but had accompanied Khalid and others of their own free will. This was affirmed by the women in a conversation with Alt News. Speaking to Alt News, Umar Khalid reiterated the same. The titles of several media reports portrayed Umar Khalid as involved in the abduction, while the articles failed to establish the same.\n\n8. Times Now announces arrest of Nirav Modi in Hong Kong\n\nAt 5:41 pm on April 9, Times Now broke a story. The story was that Nirav Modi, accused in the Rs.11000 crore PNB scam has been arrested in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cAlright, this is the big breaking news coming in now, Nirav Modi has been arrested in Hong Kong. That is what we are breaking for you first on Times Now. Reports coming in of Nirav Modi arrested in Hong Kong; this could be a major major breakthrough for the security agencies, for the investigative agencies who are trying to get Nirav Modi back in India and face the law\u201d, said the Times Now anchor.\n\nCuriously, Times Now did not return to this \u2018big breaking news\u2019, for the simple reason that Nirav Modi had not been arrested. The only update at that time was the possibility of Hong Kong acceding to India\u2019s request for his arrest.\n\n9. Misreporting by Times of India on AMU student\n\nIn January, Times of India published an article titled, \u201cRoommate of AMU PhD student who joined Hizbul also missing\u201d. A day after the news broke out that PhD scholar at Aligarh Muslim University Mannan Bashir Wani had allegedly joined terrorist group Hijbul Mujahideen, Times of India reported that his roommate too has been missing. Quoting Aligarh SSP, Rajesh Pandey, the paper claimed that a preliminary enquiry has revealed the roommate who was also from Baramulla is missing since July 2017.\n\nIn a call to Free Press Kashmir, the gentleman in question stated that \u201cI am very disturbed since I saw this report. I have a career and a life here and this news report has put me in danger. This journalist never called or spoke to me before doing this report. I don\u2019t know how they are claiming that I am missing and what they mean by it.\u201d This was also confirmed by Baramulla police via a tweet.\n\n\u201cWe were very confident that we can never come to power. So our people suggested us just to make tall promises. Now people remind us of our promises\u2026Now we just laugh and move on.\u201d said Union Minister Nitin Gadkari in 34-second clip which went viral on social media. Gadkari was on a Colors Marathi reality show, Assal Pavhane, Irsal Namune alongside Bollywood actor Nana Patekar as a guest on October 4, 2018.\n\nNumerous media organisations such the Times of India, The Week and The Wire misquoted Gadkari by reporting that the latter had acknowledged that his party made promises in the run-up to the general election of 2014.\n\nGadkari was speaking in the context of the Maharashtra assembly election which took place in late 2014, and not the general election of the same year. The false conclusion drawn by media organisations was on the basis of a truncated video clip.\n\n11. Fake news of transfer of top cop by Karnataka CM\n\nA Kannada news channel, BTV News reported in May 2018 that the IGP of Karnataka had been transferred by Karnataka CM H D Kumaraswamy. Several mainstream media organisations reported the same. These included DNA, Financial Express, Zee News and Swarajya. According to reports, the transfer took place because the top cop had made West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee walk almost a kilometre for the swearing-in ceremony of the Karnataka CM.\n\nThe fake news was busted by The News Minute which confirmed that no such transfer order has been issued. \u201cI am only the CM designate, not the CM until the floor test is over. I cannot make decisions about who should be transferred. Neelamani Raju has not been transferred now,\u201d said Kumaraswamy, according to the report by The News Minute.\n\nIn February 2018, Times Now tweeted, \u201cWhen the Abu Dhabi Crown Prince was invited on stage to share his views, he began the speech with \u2018Jai Siya Ram\u2019, sending the crowd into a frenzy.\u201d The tweet was later deleted. The Times Now story went on to say, \u201cAs Abu Dhabi gears to welcome PM Modi today, a video of its Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan is being re-circulated on the social media.Zee News reported the same.\n\nThe two channels had carried this report without due verification. It was revealed that the person in the video is not the crown prince of Abu Dhabi but Sultan Sooud Al Qassemi, a United Arab Emirates-based columnist and commentator on Arab affairs. The channels didn\u2019t pause to think whether it was plausible for Abu Dhabi Crown Prince and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Force to be opening a Ram Katha of Morari Bapu with the chant of \u2018Jai Siya Ram\u2019.\n\n13. Zee News, DNA circulate fake image of AIIMS doctors paying last respects to Vajpayee\n\n\u201cA photograph of the doctors paying their last respect to the veteran political stalwart has been accessed by Zee News\u201d, declared an article by Zee News following the death of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. \u201cAll the doctors stood in queue and observed silence as they bowed their heads as a mark of respect to the former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee\u201c, said a DNA article, describing a picture which showed doctors standing in a row with bowed heads around a dead body on a hospital bed.\n\nA closer look at the photograph would suggest that it is not from India. It is a picture from 2012 of a group of Chinese doctors paying tribute to a woman whose organs were donated after her death. Medical workers bowed to 17-year-old Wu Huajing who donated her organs after her death in Guangdong on Nov 22, 2012. Both Zee News and DNA later realized their gaffe, deleting their tweets and revising their articles.\n\nThere were numerous instances wherein mainstream news organisations fell for parody accounts of news outlets. Early this year, Aaj Tak fell for a parody account of Times Now, called Times HOW which tweeted a quote of a \u2018maulana\u2019 who had supposedly issued a fatwa against teen sensation Priya Prakash Varrier. Aaj Tak broadcast an evening programme on the same.\n\nAnother such instance included the faux pas by the news agency IANS which fell for a parody account of Tripura CM Biplab Deb.\n\nWhile instances of misinformation via media outlets throughout the year were more than a handful, on the flip side, 2018 was also the year when multiple media organisations set up dedicated fact-checking divisions. Hopefully, this will help further the cause of accurate and prudent reporting, and arrest dissemination of erroneous news in 2019.", "lang": "en"}
