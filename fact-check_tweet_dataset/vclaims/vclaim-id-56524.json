The claim is false; the image has been doctored to include the fabricated story; there are no credible media reports that the Muslim leader cited in the misleading posts made any donation to the fund.\n\nThe image was published on Facebook here on April 6, 2020.\n\nThe post\u2019s Hindi caption translates to English as: \u201cMaulana Saad donated 10-million rupees in PM relief fund on March 28. When asked why did he not tell this the people, he replied: \u2018Islam does not permit to show off charity.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe News Letter is a daily newspaper in Northern Ireland.\n\nMaulana Saad is a leader of Tablighi Jamaat, an Islamic revivalist movement that urges Muslims to practice the faith as it was during the life of Prophet Mohammed.\n\nIn March 2020, police launched an investigation after Tablighi Jamaat held a religious gathering in Delhi that was later identified as a major novel coronavirus hotspot. At least 10 attendees died after contracting the virus, AFP reported.\n\nThe same image of the purported newspaper front page was also shared on Facebook here, here, here and here; and on Twitter here, here, here and here with a similar claim.\n\nSome of the other posts include superimposed text over the purported News Letter front page that reads: \u201cThe good one that has been blamed has donated 10-million rupees into the PM\u2019s relief fund on March 29, 2020.\u201d\n\nBut the purported front page has been digitally manipulated.\n\nA reverse image search found the report about Saad was digitally imposed over an image of an authentic a News Letter front page from June 6, 2019. The image of the real newspaper was published here by the BBC.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the image in misleading Facebook post (L) and the News Letter's June 6, 2019 front page published by the BBC (R):\n\nThe News Letter\u2019s archives show that the newspaper did not publish any story on Saad on June 6, 2019. A general search on the News Letter\u2019s website for Maulana Saad also yielded no results.\n\nThe News Letter did not respond to requests for comment from AFP.\n\nThere are also no credible media reports that Saad made a donation to the government\u2019s novel coronavirus relief fund.", "lang": "en"}
