The latest was reported in September 2017, where a fire tornado formed not in Queensland state but in Watheroo town, located at the state of Western Australia.\n\nThe spliced images show a mix of fire tornadoes in other places, wildfires, and even an artwork depicting a fire tornado:\n\u2022 (1st row) Woodville village, Derbyshire in the United Kingdom last Aug. 8\n\u2022 (2nd row, right) a vegetation fire in Queensland, Australia last Aug. 31\n\u2022 (3rd row, center) a \"twister of flame\" rising from a wildfire in Simi Valley, California on Oct. 27, 2003\n\u2022 (3rd row, right) an acrylic painting of a fire tornado posted on artwork sharing community DeviantArt by user VoodooDollyArtwork on Sept. 20, 2012\n\nThe false and misleading online post was published the same week that over 110 bushfires were reported to be blazing across Queensland state.\n\nWildfires or bushfires are known to have contributed to the formation of fire tornadoes in parts of Australia.\n\nThe netizen's false and misleading story received over 790 reactions on Facebook.", "lang": "en"}
