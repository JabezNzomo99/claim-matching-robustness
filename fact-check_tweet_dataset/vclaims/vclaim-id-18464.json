Handicapped and minority children are too disruptive in the classroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cDisaster!\u201d the purported tweet continues. \u201cPerhaps not everyone needs K-12 education.\u201d\n\nThere is no record of the president tweeting this or Education Secretary Betsy DeVos saying it.\n\nThe alleged tweet, which is dated to February 14, 2017, in the screen grab, implies that DeVos believes disabled and minority students are \u201ctoo disruptive in the classroom.\u201d\n\nIf DeVos made such a statement, however, it would almost certainly have been picked up by the media, yet no news outlets have reported on it. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims That Fox News Isn\u2019t Covering The Mueller Hearings)\n\nThe Department of Education press secretary Elizabeth Hill confirmed in an email to The Daily Caller that DeVos never said anything to that effect: \u201cAbsolutely not. The Secretary never said that. And that\u2019s a fake tweet \u2014 not from the president\u2019s account.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that the president ever tweeted this. A search of his Twitter accounts \u2014@realDonaldTrump and @POTUS \u2014 turned up no results. ProPublica\u2019s archive of Trump\u2019s deleted tweets also had no record of him tweeting and then deleting it on February 14, 2017, or any other date.\n\nA Facebook group called \u201cDemocrats for a Blue America\u201d first posted the fake tweet in February 2017, according to Snopes. (The page has since been deleted.)\n\nThe original Facebook post, debunked by Snopes in 2017, likely referred to an exchange between DeVos and a Democratic senator during her confirmation hearing regarding the federal law that guarantees free appropriate public education to students with disabilities. When asked whether schools receiving federal funds should be required to meet the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act requirements, DeVos said that the matter was \u201cbest left to the states,\u201d though she later said, \u201cfederal law must be followed where federal dollars are in play.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
