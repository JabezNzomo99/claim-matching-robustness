Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr. is now attacking it.\n\nThe PET is composed of justices of the Supreme Court.\n\nIn a Jan. 10 media forum, Marcos accused Associate Justice Benjamin Caguioa of being \u201cunfair and unjust\u201d:\n\nNews reports claimed that Marcos\u2019 protest case was raffled off to Caguioa.\n\nMarcos said the PET rushed him during holy week last year to pay P36 million as first tranche to fund the poll recount, while Robredo was given an extension. Robredo was also provided soft copies of the decrypted ballot images for free, while he paid P7 million for the same images that he has yet to receive, he added.\n\nThe PET has denied Marcos' request for official copies of the decrypted ballot images.\n\nIn 2016, Marcos himself defended the PET.\n\nReacting to Robredo, who spoke of a \u201cplot to steal the vice presidency\u201d when she resigned as housing secretary, Marcos said \u201cwe must measure our words\u201d when speaking of the court:\n\nIn at least three instances since the protest case was filed, Marcos\u2019 camp welcomed the PET\u2019s resolutions when they favored him:\n\u2022 It was \u201cpleased\u201d that the PET denied Robredo\u2019s motion to dismiss the case;\n\u2022 It was \u201cglad\u201d when the court again denied Robredo\u2019s motion for reconsideration;\n\u2022 It \u201clauded\u201d the court\u2019s resolution saying the Commission on Elections, not Marcos, should pay expenses for the poll case.\n\nGMA News Online, PET keeping official copies of decrypted ballot images, other docs in VP poll protest, Jan. 18, 2018\n\nThe Manila Times, Marcos to get ballot copies in VP recount, Jan. 18, 2018\n\nbongbongmarcos.com, BBM camp lauds PET resolution rejecting COMELEC\u2019s move to pass on ballot storage fees to Marcos, Oct. 30, 2017\n\n(Guided by the code of principles of the International Fact-Checking Network at Poynter, VERA Files tracks the false claims, flip-flops, misleading statements of public officials and figures, and debunks them with factual evidence.
