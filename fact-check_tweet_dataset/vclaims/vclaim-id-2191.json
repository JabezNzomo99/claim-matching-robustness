Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to cut down on fake news.\n\nThe post appeared after Trump\u2019s Aug. 25 pardon of Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz. Arpaio had been found guilty of criminal contempt after he continued to illegally profile Latinos against a judge\u2019s orders. His sentencing was set for Oct. 5.\n\nDavis, meanwhile, was the Rowan County, Ken., clerk who had in 2015 refused to sign marriage licenses for same-sex couples on religious grounds, in defiance of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling. A federal judge sent her to jail for five days for contempt of court for not complying with an order to issue the licenses. Her deputy clerks were eventually allowed to sign the licenses; Kentucky later took county clerks\u2019 names off marriage licenses.\n\nShe had faced three lawsuits for her refusal, but the suits had been dismissed. The same judge who jailed her later ruled that in one case, the state of Kentucky and not Davis was responsible for paying $225,000 in legal fees for the couple that brought the suit.\n\nSo Davis can\u2019t get a pardon, because technically she wasn\u2019t convicted of a federal crime. But it doesn\u2019t matter, because we know that the website that posted the story makes up all its content.\n\nOurLandOfTheFree.com is a parody site that, like other sites that created stories we\u2019ve debunked, attempts to fool conservatives with absurd stories.\n\nOurLandOfTheFree.com said at the bottom of its home page that the site\u2019s creators \"make no guarantee that what you read here is true. In fact, it most definitely is not.\" Its About Us page noted, \"All posts should be considered satirical and all images photoshopped to look like something they\u2019re not.\"\n\nThe story about Davis being pardoned by Trump is as made up as the other articles on the site.\n\nWe rate this statement Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
