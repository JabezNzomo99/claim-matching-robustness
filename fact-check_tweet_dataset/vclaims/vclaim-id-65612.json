The video is viral on twitter with around 26K views. Vishvas News investigation revealed the claims to be false and the video is a clipping of 2019.\n\nA twitter user has shared a video of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray celebrating birthday with a claim that CM is busy cutting cake amid coronavirus pandemic. The archived post can be accessed here.\n\nWhen we searched on the Internet for recent news on CM Uddhav Thackeray\u2019s birthday, we found news articles on Prime Minister and Ajit Pawar sending birthday wishes to Thackeray on 27 July 2020.\n\nAccording to an NDTV article, the Chief Minister had said that he wouldn\u2019t celebrate his birthday amid covid-19 situation. \n\n \u201cInstead of spending money on garlands, the amount should be contributed to the Chief Minister\u2019s relief fund. Health camps, blood and plasma donation camps should be organised,\u201d Thackeray said, adding he would like to dedicate all the birthday wishes to COVID warriors.\n\nWhen we searched for his birthday videos, we accessed the birthday video in claim on several YouTube channels posted by news organisations on July 29, 2019.\n\nAccording to the ABP news, Chief Minister had celebrated his birthday with his family at Matoshree last year.\n\nZee 24 Taas has also posted the same video in claim on their YouTube channel on July 2019.\n\nWhen we contacted the CM\u2019s office to verify the claim, Chief Minister\u2019s close aide clarified to us that the video is of previous year.\n\n\u201cI think this is the most ridiculous tweet by a political IT cell we have seen. The video is from last year. They have no limits of going low, and every time their standards drop. Their thought process is disgusting and one that creates hate and division in the society, only thinking dirty politics during a pandemic,\u201d he replied to us over Whatsapp.\n\n\n\nConclusion: Viral video claiming CM Uddhav Thackeray celebrated birthday amid coronavirus pandemic is fake. The video is from last year celebration", "lang": "en"}
