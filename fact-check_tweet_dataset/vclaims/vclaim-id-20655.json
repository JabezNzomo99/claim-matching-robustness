Gen. Kenneth McKenzie Jr. during a May 31 press briefing at the Pentagon in Virginia.\n\nWhile discussing the militarization in the South China Sea, McKenzie, in response to a question about the United States' ability to \"blow apart\" the man-made islands in the disputed waters, said: \u201cI would just tell you that the United States military has had a lot of experience in the Western Pacific, taking down small islands.\"\n\nHe later clarified that he was not sending a message to China but was merely stating a \"historical fact.\"\n\n\"We have a lot of experience, in the Second World War, taking down small islands that are isolated. So... that's a core competency of the U.S. military that we've done before,\" McKenzie added.\n\nWebph.info published the story about a week after the U.S. conducted freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea, parts of which are being claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam and Taiwan.\n\nThe fake story, which could have reached more than 1.3 million people, carried as its content a copied 10-minute clip of a 30-minute June 1 newscast by CNN Philippines that also does not reflect the headline's claim.\n\nTraffic to the story was largely generated from social media by Facebook pages We Support Duterte Administration, and Marcos Loyalist and BongBong Marcos United. Webph.info was created a day before it published the story; Youtube channel Tokhang TV that uploaded the CNN clip in November 2016.\n\nU.S. Department of Defense Press Briefing by Pentagon Chief Spokesperson Dana W.
