{"title": "Young people in record levels of debt?", "subtitle": "It\u2019s not clear this is the case looking at the levels of debt of all young people, including those not at university.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-9463", "url": "https://fullfact.org/economy/young-people-record-levels-debt/", "vclaim": "When it comes to all young people, it\u2019s not possible to say if young people are in record levels of debt.\n\nThe official statistics we have suggest that the average debt for 16-24 year olds rose in the late noughties, but fell slightly between 2010-12 and 2012-14.\n\nWe can\u2019t say for sure what has happened because this doesn\u2019t account for inflation, or for possible error in the survey the statistics come from. We don\u2019t have any more recent figures than this.\n\nMr Corbyn\u2019s office pointed us to analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies about the debts of English graduates to back up this claim. The report says that English graduates have the highest student debts in the developed world. At over \u00a350,000, the average debt on graduation is more than double what it was in 2011 before the large increase in tuition fees in 2012.\n\nAbout half of young people study at university level in England.\n\nThe chief of the Financial Conduct Authority told the BBC earlier this week:\n\n\"There is a pronounced build up of indebtedness amongst the younger age group,\" Mr Bailey said.\n\n\"We should not think this is reckless borrowing, this is directed at essential living costs. It is not credit in the classic sense, it is [about] the affordability of basic living in many cases.\"\n\nHe also said \"There has been a clear shift in the generational pattern of wealth and income, and that translates into a greater indebtedness at a younger age\u201d.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority told us these comments weren\u2019t based on one piece of research or set of data in particular.\n\nA survey published by the Authority today found 18-24 year olds had the lowest level of financial resilience, and that 55% had unsecured debt including student loans. This is the first time it has done this survey so there is no comparable data.", "lang": "en"}
