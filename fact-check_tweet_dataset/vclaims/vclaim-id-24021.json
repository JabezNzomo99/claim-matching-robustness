The claim is false; the footage has been taken from a video game.\n\nThe video, which has been viewed more than a million times in this July 9, 2019 tweet, shows an airplane coming into land as an oil tanker parks across the runway, prompting the airplane to take off again, narrowing avoiding a collision.\n\nThe Spanish-language tweet translates to English as: \u201cTerrorist attack in Algeria, which fails to work because of the pilot's immense skill\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the tweet:\n\nThe 51 second video has also been viewed more than 34,000 times in this Twitter post uploaded on July 6, 2019.\n\nThe caption of the post says: \u201cMis-coordination between departments working at any airport in the world can lead to a major disaster. In this clip an oil tanker was crossing runway and at the [sic] same time an aircraft fully loaded with passengers landed. One must appreciate [as] how pilot save lives of the passengers\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading tweet:\n\nThe video has been viewed thousands of times here and here on Facebook, here and here on Twitter, and here on YouTube with an almost identical claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the video does not show a real-life event, it has been taken from a simulation video game.\n\nAFP conducted keyword and reverse image searches on Google and found a very similar clip, in much higher-definition, at the one minute 32 seconds mark in a video published here on a gaming YouTube channel on June 20, 2019.\n\nThe video, entitled \u201cGTA5 -- An \"Oil Tanker\" Accidentally Came in the Runway during landing of A380\u2026\u201d, shows a pilot i.e. gamer\u2019s success in \u201caverting\u201d a plane-oil tanker collision.\n\nGTA5 refers to Grand Theft Auto V, an action-adventure video game published by American video game company Rockstar Games.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of footage in the misleading tweet (L) and the YouTube video (R):\n\nA journalist in AFP's Delhi bureau contacted the creator of the YouTube, Pakistan based gamer Umer Imran.\n\nHe told AFP in an email on July 10: \"This is just a game clip of GTA5.\"\n\nOther GTA5 gamers\u2019 attempts to \u201cland\u201d an A380 can be seen in similar YouTube videos here and here.\n\nFrance 24 and VICE reported in July the false claim started gaining attention after Pakistani politician Khurram Nawaz Gandapur tweeted the video on July 5, 2019.\n\nKhurram Nawaz Gandapur, Secretary-General of the Pakistan Awami Tereek party, wrote in the caption of the post: \u201cNarrow escape of an aircraft which could have ended in a great disaster. Miraculous save by the pilot\u2019s presence of mind.\u201d\n\nThe now-deleted tweet can be viewed here on digital archive site archive.today.", "lang": "en"}
