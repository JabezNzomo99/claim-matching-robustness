This is false; the photo was taken in 2015 and the post riffs on a common complaint among Buhari\u2019s opponents that he is unaware of major developments around him.\n\nThe image, which was posted by a Facebook page called \u201cDailymail gist\u201d on February 16 -- the initial date for the presidential election -- has been shared nearly 4,000 times.\n\n\u201cBreaking news: Buhari Just Arrived His Unit For Accreditation, Saying He Is Not Aware That The Elections Has Been Postponed,\u201d reads the caption.\n\nA similar post by a Facebook page called \"Nigeria Politics Today\" also used a different picture from 2015 to make the same misleading claim.\n\nA tweet with the same message, but without the photo, was retweeted more than 600 times.\n\nBuhari\u2019s opponents have repeatedly accused him of being unaware of major developments around him, including that Nigeria\u2019s former top policeman Ibrahim Idris disobeyed orders to relocate to Benue state last year to deal with a wave of attacks by herdsmen.\n\nThe Facebook post plays on the same theme, and at least some readers appeared to interpret it as a satirical or humorous post.\n\nBut other readers interpreted it as real \u201cbreaking news\u201d. \u201cShould he be hearing the postponement on radio and television? I weep for this nation,\u201d wrote one user under the photo.\n\nBut Buhari had already responded to the announcement of a delay hours before the Facebook post was uploaded, and reporters following him in his hometown of Daura said he did not visit a polling booth that day.\n\nThe president\u2019s campaign team had released a statement at 6:46 am on Saturday condemning the decision by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to delay the elections, while the Facebook post was not uploaded until 11:14 am.\n\nOn Monday, Buhari addressed senior members of his ruling All Progressives Congress party at an emergency meeting in Abuja and told them: \"I was told of the decision by INEC at about 4:35 in the morning.\"\n\nBuhari was indeed in his northern hometown of Daura on Saturday, where he had been due to cast his vote until INEC announced, just hours before polls were due to open, that the presidential vote was being delayed for a week for logistical reasons.\n\nBut an AFP reporting team in Daura said the president did not visit any polling booth on that day. Instead, he headed straight back to Abuja.\n\nA reverse image search shows that the picture used in the post was in fact taken by Associated Press photographer Ben Curtis on March 28, 2015, when Buhari was preparing to vote in the election that brought him to the presidency.", "lang": "en"}
