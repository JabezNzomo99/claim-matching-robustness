I feel it is the indication of their hatred against Hinduism not CAA As an Hindu why should I tolerate such hatred protests under Secularism? It all shows that instead of Rohingya, the Indian secular muslim are dangerous to nation Does JAI BHIM / BABA SAHEEB taught them to hate Hindus in their own land?\n\nUpdate: The clip is also circulating with the claim that this took place in Kerala. It alleges that the Muslim community in the state threw shoes at posters of Hindu deities, then burned them. \u201c\u0915\u0947\u0930\u0932\u092e\u0947\u0902CAA\u0915\u0947\u0935\u093f\u0930\u094b\u0927\u092e\u0947\u0902\u0935\u0939\u093e\u0902\u0915\u0947\u092e\u0941\u0916\u094d\u092f\u092e\u0902\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0914\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0902\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938\u0938\u092e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0924\u092e\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0932\u093f\u092e\u0938\u092e\u0941\u0926\u093e\u092f\u0915\u0947\u0932\u094b\u0917\u094b\u0902\u0928\u0947\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0942\u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0915\u0947\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0924\u093e\u0913\u0902 \u0915\u0940 \u0924\u0938\u094d\u0935\u0940\u0930\u094b\u0902 \u092a\u0930 \u092a\u0939\u0932\u0947 \u091c\u0942\u0924\u0947 \u092e\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u0914\u0930 \u092b\u093f\u0930 \u0909\u0928\u094d\u0939\u0947\u0902 \u0906\u0917 \u0932\u0917\u093e \u0926\u0940 \u0917\u0908\u0964 is this secularism,\u201d reads the complete message.\n\nThe clip is widely circulating on Twitter and Facebook. Alt News has also received a verification request on its official mobile application where the claim suggests that pictures of Hindu gods were set ablaze by members of the Muslim community.\n\nIf one carefully listens to the audio, the people in the clip can be heard chanting slogans in Kannada. At the 58-second mark in the video shared by Satya Bhat Suda, one can hear the protestors chant, \u201cZindabad, Zindabad! Ambedkar Zindabad!\u201d Using this as a cue, Alt News performed a keyword search on Facebook and found a link to this video from 2018.\n\nOn August 23, 2018, Facebook user Prashanth Venkataswamy posted the viral video in question with the claimed and wrote, \u201cWhy this hell\u2026 What Hindus god have done to you\u2026 Secularism should be banned \u2026 Bring uniform civil code.\u201d\n\nOther users had also shared the clip that same month, blaming supporters of B R Ambedkar of burning the posters. (archive)\n\nAlt News couldn\u2019t verify the exact nature of the protest however, it is clearly not linked with CAA protests. The claim made in social media that the viral video shows CAA protestors are burning posters of Hindu deities is false.\n\n[Update: The claim \u2018Muslim community burns posters of Hindu deities in Kerala\u2019 has been added to the report.]", "lang": "en"}
