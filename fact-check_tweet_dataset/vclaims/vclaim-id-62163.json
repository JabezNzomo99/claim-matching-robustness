(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe U.S. Marshals announced in an Aug. 27 news release that it located 39 missing children in Georgia over a two-week period as part of a mission called \"Operation Not Forgotten.\" The operation resulted in the rescue of 26 children, the safe location of 13 others, and nine arrests.\n\n\"These missing children were considered to be some of the most at-risk and challenging recovery cases in the area, based on indications of high-risk factors such as victimization of child sex trafficking, child exploitation, sexual abuse, physical abuse, and medical or mental health conditions,\" the release reads.\n\n\"Other children were located at the request of law enforcement to ensure their wellbeing. USMS investigators were able to confirm each child's location in person and assure their safety and welfare.\"\n\nAuthorities didn\u2019t disclose where the children were found, but there is no evidence that it was in a \"double wide trailer.\"\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t appear that all 39 children were found in the same location, according to the release. CBS News reported that investigators fanned out across two Georgia cities, Atlanta and Macon, to locate the children.\n\nMeanwhile, the story received nationwide coverage from news outlets that include ABC News, CNN, CBS News, Fox News, NBC News, the Hill, the Atlanta-Journal Constitution, and People magazine.", "lang": "en"}
