In recent years this advice has been widely spread as information suggesting that spraying vinegar and water (mixed in a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio) will remove ice from an already iced-over windshield:\n\nI read that the mixture of 2/3 vinegar and 1/3 water mixture to get ice off your car windows will pit the glass. true or false?\n\nThis tip originated not as a method but rather as a way of stopping ice from building up on a windshield in the first place, as noted in a 1992 newspaper advice column:\n\nQ: I keep my car outdoors at night during the winter. I use one of those cardboards on the windshield, but it still ices and frosts up. What can I do to stop this? A: Dip a sponge or cloth into a solution of three parts of either white or yellow vinegar to one part of water. The windshield should stay ice-free. Repeat occasionally.\n\nA 1980 \u201cHints from Heloise\u201d column advocated the same idea:\n\nAs for whether a mixture of vinegar and water will work to remove ice that has already accumulated on a windshield, a number of those who have tried it have found that the concoction doesn\u2019t really seem very effective for that purpose:\n\nThe issue of whether this method of ice prevention will indeed pit windshield glass is a matter of contention, with some cautioning it does:\n\nHowever, others assert vinegar is commonly used in glass cleaning solutions and ordinary household vinegar is far too weak a form of acetic acid to produce this sort of damage:\n\nVery few acids will dissolve glass \u2014 that\u2019s why they keep them in glass bottles. Does your vinegar bottle look pock-marked? Windex (and other glass cleaners) are normally 5% ammonia in some sort of volatile solvent, with some detergents and other chemicals. The more environmentally-friendly variants replace the ammonia with acetic acid. A solution of 5% acetic acid (typical white vinegar) isn\u2019t going to hurt anything that 5% ammonia wouldn\u2019t.\n\nYet others note even if vinegar doesn\u2019t harm windshield glass, it might cause damage to paint, chrome, or other exterior surfaces, so it should be used on automobiles with caution and wiped up promptly if spilled.\n\nIn general, we\u2019ve found no consensus about how effective the use of a vinegar-water mixture to remove or prevent windshield ice might be, or whether it carries a potential risk that outweighs its benefits. However, there are a variety of other methods for dealing with windshield ice that motorists can employ, including the use of commercial\n\n ice and frost prevention sprays:", "lang": "en"}
