The claims in the posts are false; the video has been edited and used out of context from an original in which he promises to not misuse the agencies if he wins the election.\n\nThe clip can be seen in multiple Facebook posts, such as this April 6, 2019, entry which has since been viewed more than 85,000 times, as well as here and here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Facebook post with the most views:\n\nTranslated white text in red area in the video reads: \u201cPRABOWO WILL ABOLISH THE POLICE, THE INDONESIAN MILITARY, PROSECUTOR OFFICES, THE POSITION OF REGENTS AND GOVERNORS, ETC.\u201d\n\nSubianto\u2019s speech in Indonesian translates to English as: \u201cHere, at this televised moment, I swear that, if I got elected president, I would never use the police, the military, the intelligence, the prosecutors, the regents, the governors. I would never use them.\u201d\n\nAFP copied the Indonesian speech on Google and found it was used as a quote in this March 29, 2019, report by Indonesian news outlet Suara.com.\n\nThe report\u2019s translated headline reads: \u201cPrabowo pledges to not use military, police for political interest\u201d.\n\nUsing some keywords from Subianto\u2019s speech in the Facebook video, AFP found the longer version of the video was shared to Twitter here on March 31, 2019, by Fadli Zon, deputy chairman of Subianto\u2019s Gerindra Party.\n\nIn Zon's clip, Subianto says: \u201cHere, at this televised moment, I swear that, if I get elected president, I would never use the police, the military, the intelligence, the prosecutors, the regents, the governors. I would never use them for my personal political interests.\u201d\n\nThe edited versions of the misleading Facebook video deleted the moment when Subianto said: \u201c... for my personal political interests\u201d heard at 0:19 in the original footage.\n\nAlso on March 29, 2019, state-run news agency Antara reported on the same occasion in this article.\n\nSubianto is facing President Joko Widodo in the presidential election in April. The Jakarta Post reported about their ballot numbers here.", "lang": "en"}
