The messages direct would-be applicants to a website \u2013 http://maxhog.com/canada \u2013 urging them that \u201cregistration for the Canada 2019 Immigration Program for getting Canadian citizenship in a few steps,\u201d\n\nThe website also tells would-be applicants that there are 345 visas remaining, prompting them to act fast.\n\nHowever, a message was sent to the High Commission via mail and its official Facebook Page and here\u2019s the response:\n\n\u201cPlease let this be regarded as fake news. For everything related to visa and immigration, the best place to get the most authentic news is WWW.CIC.GC.CA or Canada.ca/visit,\u201d read the response.\n\nEven more, the message from the Commission reads: \u201cit is completely fake news and false and people should please not fall for that.\u201d\n\nWe also checked the official website and nowhere did Canadian Visa Lottery appear on the website.\n\nIn fact, a similar news surfaced in 2018 and the Commission had on May 7, 2018 warned Nigerians to note that a scammer listed an incorrect phone number for the Canadian High Commission in Abuja online that may appear when one searches for the Commission on Google.\n\nThe commission then went on to list its contact information.\n\nOUR CONCLUSION? This is FALSE!", "lang": "en"}
