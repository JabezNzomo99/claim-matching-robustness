There\u2019s ANOTHER hidden message inbox on Facebook https://t.co/2wwv4IoLAM via @hellogiggles\n\nOn 5 April 2016, the blog HelloGiggles published an article reporting that the filtering of messages sent through Facebook\u2019s Messenger facility goes deeper than most users know. Although most users are aware of their \u201cother\u201d inbox (but didn\u2019t always check it), there is a second \u201cother\u201d inbox that\u2019s harder to find:\n\nWe\u2019re about to share with you something that will change your life, probably (and suck up any free time you have). There is a whole vault of unseen Facebook messages in your inbox you didn\u2019t even know existed \u2026 Sounds suspicious and too weird to be true. But stay with us, and we\u2019ll help you uncover them. OK, so you know how there\u2019s a \u201cmessage request\u201d box in your Facebook messenger inbox where you can either accept or deny messages from people who aren\u2019t your friends? Well, Facebook does some filtering of its own to decide which messages even pop up in that request section in the first place. Think of it like your email automatically sifts out spam. This means there are potentially a huge pile of unseen (and unanswered) messages that didn\u2019t make the \u201cmessage request\u201d cut. Who knows? Some of them might be useful \u2026 We just went through all the steps and found so many messages.\n\nReaching the hidden mailbox requires following a particular series of steps. For our trial, we used Facebook Messenger, which can be employed to access Facebook messages without going directly to Facebook.com. Below is the area where Messenger displays \u201cother\u201d messages (filtered from the normal inbox):\n\nAccessing them through Facebook.com was slightly different:\n\nOn Messenger, clicking the gear icon at the top-left corner of the page brings up dialog options for \u201cMessage Requests,\u201d and then at the bottom of that screen, an option for \u201cFiltered Requests\u201d:\n\nAnd indeed, clicking \u201cfiltered requests\u201d leads to an archive of twice-filtered messages that don\u2019t show up in Facebook\u2019s \u201cother\u201d inbox:\n\nThe process of finding these filtered requests is slightly different when pursued through Facebook.com. There, a drop-down \u201cmore\u201d menu appears to the immediate right of the \u201cmessages\u201d link, and clicking it displays three options: \u201cunread\u201d (main inbox messages you haven\u2019t yet opened), \u201cfiltered\u201d (the \u201cother other\u201d inbox messages you haven\u2019t likely seen), and \u201carchived\u201d (messages marked no longer active, either by user choice or due to inactive/blocked accounts):\n\nBy clicking \u201cfiltered\u201d we were able to bring up the same list of previously unseen and unheard messages as before, many of which were relatively recent:\n\nIt\u2019s likely most of your filtered messages are communications from spammers, strangers, or scammers that you would rather not see. But just in case, those hidden messages still exist and are accessible if you know how to find them.", "lang": "en"}
