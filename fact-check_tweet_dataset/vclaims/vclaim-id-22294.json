Facebook users flagged it as potentially false, and it is.\n\nThe story originated on a website called ReaganWasRight.com, which describes its content as \u201cconservative satire.\u201d But the story was recently copied and posted by more than a dozen other websites that don\u2019t have a disclaimer, some of which have names that sound like legitimate news outlets.\n\nOne website calls itself The Hill Live, a name similar to the Washington, D.C. newspaper The Hill, and another calls itself The Politico News, a name similar to the political news website Politico. The two phony sites have no connection to the legitimate ones. They were each created in January and registered through a company that hides the identity of the site\u2019s owner.\n\nThe made-up story that they posted says: \u201cVoting machines in 11 states now tied to a company owned by a group of Democrat \u2018activists\u2019 that includes George Soros, Chelsea Clinton, Barack and Michelle Obama and the estate of John Kennedy have been declared \u2018compromised\u2019 and their votes discounted.\u201d\n\nBut the company those Democratic heavyweights supposedly own doesn\u2019t appear to exist. Novus Ordo Seclorum is a Latin phrase \u2014 meaning \u201cnew order of the ages\u201d \u2014 that appears on the back of the U.S. dollar bill. There is no record of a voting machine manufacturer by that name.\n\nThe market for electronic voting machines is dominated by three companies that control 92 percent of the market, according to a 2017 report from the University of Pennsylvania. The company with the largest share is Omaha, Nebraska-based Election Systems & Software, which was led for more than a decade by Aldo Tesi.\n\nTesi has donated to a political action committee, called Commercial Federal, that supported largely, but not exclusively, Republican candidates for House and Senate races in Nebraska. He also gave $500 to Democrat Ben Nelson\u2019s first campaign for U.S. Senate in 1996. Nelson, who had been the state\u2019s governor throughout most of the 1990s, made it to the Senate in 2001 and became one of that body\u2019s most conservative Democrats, according to GovTrack.us.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that a false story has gotten popular by claiming that millions of Democratic votes were fraudulent.\n\nIn August, we wrote about a claim that 25 million votes for Hillary Clinton were fraudulent. That story wasn\u2019t true, either.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nU.S. Department of State. \u201cThe Great Seal of the United States.\u201d Jul 2003.", "lang": "en"}
