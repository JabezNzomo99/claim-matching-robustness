Kaepernick confirmed the new deal on social media, generating a mixed response of praise and boycotts.\n\nThen a San Francisco 49ers quarterback, Kaepernick started kneeling during the national anthem before games in 2016 to protest the treatment of people of color in the United States. He\u2019s been without an NFL contract for more than a year-and-a-half and has filed a collusion complaint that claims NFL owners have kept him off the field because of his protests, not because of his football ability.\n\nCharlottePost.site posted a fictitious article two days later with the headline, \"BREAKING: Michael Jordan resigns from the board at Nike-takes \u2018Air Jordans\u2019 with him.\"\n\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nJordan\u2019s supposed spokesman is quoted in the article saying Jordan is \"completely against the hiring of a traitor and is taking his shoes elsewhere.\" The spokesman\u2019s name is Art Tubolls, an anagram of \"Busta Troll.\"\n\nBusta Troll is a pen name for Christopher Blair \u2014 the man who runs the America\u2019s Last Line of Defense websites, which are among the biggest sources of false news online.\n\nThe false CharlottePost.site story was copied from one such website, which self-identifies as a satire site. CharlottePost.site did not include a disclaimer on its home page or on the story.\n\nCharlottePost.site \u2014 a month-old stream of anonymous clickbait \u2014 should not be confused with The Charlotte Post, a newspaper that has covered minority communities in North Carolina and South Carolina for nearly 140 years.\n\nWe have checked two other fake news stories this week that were copied from America\u2019s Last Line of Defense and then touted as factual. They were not. We rated both Pants on Fire.\n\nThis copy-paste job is no exception. We rate the claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
