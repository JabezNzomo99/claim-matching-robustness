The animal is real but the claim is false; the video actually shows a type of worm that experts say poses no risk to humans.\n\nThe video has been viewed more than two million times in this Facebook post published on August 14, 2019. The post has been shared more than 50,000 times.\n\nThe Bengali language caption translates to English as: \"Thinnest venomous snake inside the capsicum. Be careful before eating capsicum.\"\n\nThe two-minute five-second clip is shown in a screenshot below:\n\nIn other Facebook posts, the same clip has been said to show a new kind of deadly worm in Portuguese, the world\u2019s thinnest snake in French and Arabic, the world\u2019s thinnest snake which is poisonous in Hindi, and a tapeworm in English. The posts have been shared more than 200,000 times.\n\nThe same video has circulated since at least August 6, 2019 when it was posted on a YouTube channel that includes content from India.\n\nReporters in AFP\u2019s New Delhi bureau confirmed the comments heard in the footage and written below are in Punjabi -- the official language in India\u2019s northern state of Punjab. \u200b\n\n\u201cLook, it\u2019s alive and moving\u2026 now it\u2019s coming out -- it\u2019s got a long body. Look at what\u2019s coming out of the pepper.\u201d\n\nA screenshot of the YouTube clip is shown below with the caption \u201cCheck Capsicum before cooking.. Thread worm..\u201d\n\nThreadworms are small parasitic worms, typically between four to ten millimetres long, which infest the large intestine.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the clip in the Bengali language post (L) and the YouTube post (R):\n\nSome Arabic-language posts like this one referred to the animal is a nematomorpha -- or \u201chorsehair\u201d -- worm.\n\nMaria Achinelly, a doctor of natural sciences and member of the Argentinian Parasitology Association, said the worm in the misleading posts corresponded with images of nematomorpha.\n\nThe \u201cworm appears to be a nematomorpha or perhaps a nematoda of the mermithidae family. They share similar characteristics. To distinguish between them you would need to put them under a magnifying glass or microscope,\u201d Achinelly said.\n\nNematomorpha mostly live in aquatic environments but can also be found in damp soil. They are parasites as larvae and live independently in water as adults.\n\nNematodes -- also known as roundworms -- are parasites that feed on animals and plants, or as \u201cfree-living\u201d creatures in soil and water.\n\n\u201cRegardless which type of worm this is, the biology is similar -- they are worms\u2026 they are parasites that depend on insects and kill those that carry them,\u201d Achinelly said.\n\n\u201cThey are... able to parasite off cockroaches, lobsters, spiders, scorpions, but never animals like birds, reptiles, amphibians or humans\u2026 They are not dangerous to touch or ingest\u201d, Achinelly added.\n\nSixto Raul Costamagna -- a parasite specialist -- suggested people \u201cnot be alarmed, and wash fruit and vegetables before eating them\u201d, adding it\u2019s best not to eat the worms as they could bring on allergies.\n\nThe misleading posts have been fact checked in English, Hindi, Spanish and Portuguese.", "lang": "en"}
