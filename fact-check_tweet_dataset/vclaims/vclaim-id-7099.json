That\u2019s true.\n\nIt\u2019s not true that the drugs they used were approved by the Food and Drug Administration, as was claimed by a story circulating on Facebook under the headline: \u201cBig Pharma Synthetic Marijuana Leaves 2 Dead, 89 Hospitalized In Illinois.\u201d\n\nThe number of those who died is wrong in the headline because the story was copied, for the most part, from a legitimate report that was published on April 6, when that number was accurate.\n\nThe recent story that Facebook users flagged as potentially false comes from a site registered to an owner in Pakistan and differs in a couple of important ways from the original. It has a misleading headline (indicating that the drugs were made by regulated pharmaceutical manufacturers) and it starts out with a sentence that is wrong.\n\nIt says at the top: \u201cThe users ingested an FDA-approved version of synthetic cannabis known as K2 or Spice.\u201d\n\nThe FDA has approved three drugs with synthetic versions of chemicals similar to or the same as those found in marijuana \u2014 Marinol, Syndros, and Cesamet can be used to help with nausea from cancer treatments and Marinol and and Syndros can also be used to treat weight loss in AIDS patients. The FDA is currently reviewing another drug related to marijuana that would treat epilepsy.\n\nNeither \u201cK2\u201d nor \u201cSpice\u201d has been approved by the FDA, administration spokesman Michael Felberbaum confirmed.\n\nNot only are they not approved by the FDA, those are two of the most common names under which imitation marijuana is sold. A Drug Enforcement Administration official, Susan Gibson, used them as an example when she testified in front of Congress earlier this year, saying, \u201cSynthetic cannabinoids and their byproducts (sometimes sold under brand names such as K2 or Spice) continue to be a significant threat to public health and safety.\u201d\n\nSynthetic cannabinoids are typically sprayed onto dried plant material and smoked or used in e-cigarettes to achieve a high similar to marijuana, but their effects can be unpredictable and dangerous, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The drugs used in the recent spate of overdoses in Illinois and surrounding states included a chemical found in rat poison, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nNIDA: These chemicals are called cannabinoids because they are similar to chemicals found in the marijuana plant. Because of this similarity, synthetic cannabinoids are sometimes misleadingly called \u201csynthetic marijuana\u201d (or \u201cfake weed\u201d), and they are often marketed as safe, legal alternatives to that drug. In fact, they are not safe and may affect the brain much more powerfully than marijuana; their actual effects can be unpredictable and, in some cases, more dangerous or even life-threatening.\n\nThe chemical composition of imitation marijuana can vary, which makes legislating against it difficult, although all 50 states have banned some form of synthetic cannabinoids, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In Illinois, imitation marijuana is illegal under two laws \u2014 one that was passed specifically to address those drugs and under the state\u2019s Controlled Substances Act, according to Eileen Boyce, spokeswoman for the Illinois attorney general.\n\nIn April 2017 the DEA temporarily added chemical compounds often used in imitation marijuana to the list of schedule 1 controlled substances, citing overdoses on the increasingly popular drug as the reason. Those compounds are set to remain on the list until April 10, 2019.\n\nSo, if you\u2019ve read the story traveling around Facebook and gotten the impression that people are dying from legal, regulated medications related to marijuana \u2014 they\u2019re not. The imitation marijuana that is killing people is unregulated and illegal.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nIllinois Department of Public Health.
