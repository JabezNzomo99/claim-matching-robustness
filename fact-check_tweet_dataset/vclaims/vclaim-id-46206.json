As per the caption of the video, this incident took place in Mansehra, a city in Pakistan.\n\nWe found the official Twitter account of Manshara Police and found a tweet dated March 30. Replying to the same video, Manshara Police said, \u201cThis incident has already been brought to the notice of DIG Hazara and DPO Manshara and police stations have been directed to refrain from giving such punishments from now on. An inquiry has also been set up, we will keep you updated.\u201d (translated)\n\nThis proves that the video in question is not from INDIA.
