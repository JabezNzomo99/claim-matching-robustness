No, it is a satirical report published by a California website that specializes in social commentary through satire. The claim that the church is planning to add an 11th commandment to the previous 10 handed down by God to Moses is also satire. That commandment purportedly would read: \"Thou shalt not lead thy priest into temptation, for it bringeth upon the Holy Church great annoyance and bad publicity.\" The satire is a commentary on the priest sex abuse controversy enveloping the Catholic Church.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on March 11, 2019 titled \"Catholic Church introduces burka for altar servers\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nFollowing the recent Vatican abuse summit, the Catholic Church today announced key measures to tackle the issue going forward, including a stipulation that altar servers don the burka.
