The Wire took down down the articles in compliance with the ex-parte order of temporary injunction. Rajeev Chandrasekhar is the NDA chairman from Kerala and an investor in Arnab Goswami\u2019s new channel \u2018Republic TV\u2019. Pretty sure the loudmouth Arnab Goswami will have no problem with the gag on media that one of his investors is sponsoring. However, Internet is a place where NOTHING CAN BE DELETED.\n\nA website called \u201carchive.is\u201d came to the rescue. The website \u201carchive.is\u201d can take a snapshot of any webpage and this snapshot will always be alive even if the original webpage disappears. Folks on Twitter took snapshots of the Wire articles from the Cached versions available via Google. Now if Rajeev Chandrashekhar has to bring down these versions available at \u201carchive.is\u201d website, he has to make a court ask Denis Petrov from Prague, Czech Republic, to take down these versions because he is the owner of the \u201carchive.is\u201d website. Pretty sure that is not happening, or at least not in near future.\n\nThe first article by Sandeep Bhushan published on January 25th and titled \u201cArnab\u2019s Republic, Modi\u2019s Ideology\u201d is available here =>http://archive.is/ayuDs\n\nThe second article by Sachin Rao published on February 17th and titled \u201cIn Whose Interests Do Our Soldiers March?\u201d and which talks about the clear conflict of interest in Rajeev Chandrasekhar being part of the parliamentary committee on defence and investing in private defence manufacturing is available here =>https://archive.is/ODFIC", "lang": "en"}
