The archived article can be viewed here. Below is a screenshot of ANI's article.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile Tellychakkar, a popular television news website, Catchnews.com and Dailypioneer confused model and fitness expert Karan Oberoi with the accused.\n\nBOOM reached out to the former, who was distressed by the entire turn of events. Karan said, \u201cI really don\u2019t know how can you confuse between two people just because you have the same name.\"\n\n\"We of course don\u2019t look similar. I am a fashion and fitness model and I have not ventured into acting till now. Even my Wikipedia page says so and there is an URL that leads to the actor Karan\u2019s page. Where, on the other hand, the accused is a seasoned actor on TV. This is utter confusion and something that you would not want to be associated with.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe model also told BOOM that he had called up a news portal to rectify the mistake. \u201cHowever, I was asked to give proof of the fact that I am not him!\u201d\n\n\n\nBOOM also sent the photographs which were wrongly used to identify the accused TV actor to Shailesh Pasalwad, Senior Police Inspector, Oshiwara Police for a verification.\n\nPasalwad identified the accused as the man in the below photo.\n\nActor Karan Oberoi has been arrested for allegedly raping and blackmailing a woman. Oberoi has been booked under sections for 376 (rape) and 384 (blackmail), Pasalwad confirmed to BOOM. \n\n\n\nKaran Oberoi has worked in TV serial Jassi Jaisi Koi Nahin, and was a member of the 90s Band of Boys.", "lang": "en"}
