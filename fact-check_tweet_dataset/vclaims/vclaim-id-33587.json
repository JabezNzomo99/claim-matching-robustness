Russian outlets initially claimed Burkov had been arrested in Israel in December of 2015 under a U.S. warrant and not an INTERPOL red notice, although subsequent Russian state media reports noted that an international arrest warrant was issued.\n\nAccusations of lawlessness, inhumane prison conditions and chronic health issues in the Burkov case mirror similar statements made in connection with convicted foreign agent Maria Butina.\n\nRussian state media have strongly criticized the extradition of other Russian citizens to the U.S., with Dmitry Kiselyov, head of the Rossiya Segodnya state information agency and a Rossiya 1 host, calling Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot who was sentenced to prison for conspiracy to commit drug trafficking in 2011, a \u201chostage.\u201d\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry demanded the release of convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, the so-called \u201cMerchant of Death,\u201d sentenced to 25 years in prison by a U.S. court following his 2011 extradition from Thailand.\n\nRussia\u2019s Foreign Ministry has called Bout\u2019s arrest and extradition to the U.S. illegal.", "lang": "en"}
