In his address, the president claimed African-Americans are coming back to the Republican Party in \u201crecord numbers,\u201d although the president gave no basis for that claim. Only 8% of black voters picked Mr. Trump in 2016, and his support among black voters was just 10% in a recent Quinnipiac poll. Mr. Trump made the case that Democrats are only interested in African-Americans for their votes every four years, saying they \u201cdon\u2019t fight\u201d for the African-American community. Mr. Trump insisted he won\u2019t take those votes for granted. \u201cThey don\u2019t care. But we do,\u201d the president said.\n\nSome photographs purportedly captured at that event that showed both blacks and non-blacks wearing shirts bearing the identifier \u201cBlacks for Trump\u201d prompted readers to query us about the authenticity of those pictures, particularly one photograph featuring an older white couple:\n\nThe latter photograph, and others like it, were indeed authentic, as described in a New Yorker article about the event (which included a different picture of the same couple):\n\nBefore noon on Friday, as he was leaving the Atlanta Regional Commission\u2019s \u201cState of the Region\u201d breakfast at the Georgia World Congress Center, in downtown Atlanta, Bem Joiner, a local entrepreneur, saw an elderly white couple \u201cwalking so jovial towards us,\u201d as he later put it to me, in a direct message. The grinning couple wore matching white T-shirts with black lettering that read \u201cblacks for trump.\u201d Joiner, who is black, said, \u201cmy homegirl took the pic\u201d of the couple, which Joiner later posted on Instagram, \u201ccause I was too in awe of the situation.\u201d In the caption, Joiner referred to the scene as being something out of \u201cThe Twilight Zone.\u201d In fact, the couple was in the building for the inaugural Black Voices for Trump rally, which was going to begin a few hours later, in a nearby room.\n\nSome viewers apparently found such pictures somewhat incongruous, but in general we readily accept that people often support causes that don\u2019t directly affect them: men take part in League of Women Voters functions; healthy people participate in campaigns to raise awareness of breast cancer; citizens hold rallies in support of immigrants, etc. In that same vein, non-blacks might well demonstrate support for a political party or candidate who they felt would undertake greater efforts to assist black citizens.", "lang": "en"}
