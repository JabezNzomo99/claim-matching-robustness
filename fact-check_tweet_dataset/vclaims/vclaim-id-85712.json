Trump\u2019s facile claim that his refugee policy is similar to Obama\u2019s in 2011\n\nObama responded to an actual threat \u2014 the discovery that two Iraqi refugees had been implicated in bombmaking in Iraq that had targeted U.S. troops. Under congressional pressure, officials decided to reexamine all previous refugees and impose new screening procedures, which led to a slowdown in processing new applications. Trump, by contrast, issued his executive order without any known triggering threat. Obama\u2019s policy did not prevent all citizens of that country from traveling to the United States. Trump\u2019s policy was much more sweeping. The Trump White House failed to provide any evidence for its position, pointing to attacks unrelated to countries named in the original executive order. (Note: This is the most popular fact check in The Fact Checker\u2019s 10-year history.)\n\n3. President Trump and accusations of sexual misconduct: The complete list\n\nSuch contemporaneous accounts are essential to establishing the credibility of the allegation because they reduce the chance that a person is making up a story for political purposes. The Fact Checker provided a list of 13 women who have publicly come forward with claims that Trump had physically touched them inappropriately in some way, and the witnesses they provided. We did not include claims that were made only through Facebook posts or other social media or in lawsuits that were withdrawn. We also did not include the accounts of former beauty contestants who say Trump walked in on them when they were half nude because there were no allegations of touching.\n\n5. Ted Cruz\u2019s claim that two-thirds of the Hurricane Sandy bill \u2018had nothing to do with Sandy\u2019\n\n6. Here\u2019s what you need to know about preexisting conditions in the GOP health plan\n\nWhen it comes to health care, readers should be wary about claims that important changes in coverage are without consequences and that people are \u201cprotected\u201d \u2014 or that the changes will result in massive dislocation and turmoil. There are always winners and losers in a bill of this size. In this case, if the House bill ever became law, much would depend on unknown policy decisions by individual states \u2014 and then how those decisions are implemented.\n\n7. Did President Trump add $33 million to Puerto Rico\u2019s debt by bankrupting a golf course there?\n\n9.
