Let\u2019s analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: BJP leaders being beaten in Northeast India during their door-to-door campaign in favour of CAA, NRC and NPR. Fact: The video is of West Bengal BJP workers being heckled in Darjeeling allegedly by rebel Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) workers, in 2017. So, the video has nothing to do with the recent CAA, NRC and NPR issues. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nIn the video, men wearing BJP scarfs can be seen being attacked and the vehicles in the premises have the registration of West Bengal State. So, when searched on Google with keywords \u2018BJP leaders attacked in West Bengal\u2019, many search results were obtained. A news video of \u2018Republic TV\u2019 had similar visuals. This news video had the timestamp as \u2018October 5, 2017\u2019 and it reported that West Bengal BJP President Dilip Ghosh and other BJP leaders were heckled by a rebel group of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) in Darjeeling during a public meeting. The group was of the supporters of expelled GJM leader Tamang. More information about the incident can be read here.\n\n\n\nTo summarize, a 2017 video from WB is being shared with false narrative \u2013 \u2018BJP leaders beaten in NE during a campaign in favour of CAA, NRC and NPR\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new video in the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
