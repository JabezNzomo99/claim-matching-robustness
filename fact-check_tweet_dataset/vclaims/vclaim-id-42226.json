Sameed Kakroo, Jammu Bureau chief of Greater Kashmir tweeted a screenshot of one such press release statement issued by J&K BJP.\n\nThe press release received by the editor at 6:21 pm on February 14, 2019 stated, \u201cI strongly condemn the attack on the police post in Shopian and condole the deaths of 12 CRP personnel in the duty.\u201d Kakroo pointed out BJP\u2019s faux pas, \u201cWhile the entire nations mourns the martyrdom of #CRPF soldiers in Awantipora, the former deputy CM @KavinderGupta from @BJP4JnK condoles \u201cdeath of CRPF soldiers in a police post of Shopian\u201d. Wow. Incompetency at its peak\u201d. It may be emphasised here that no media reports had emerged about such an incident in Shopian district up until this point.\n\nAt 9:34 pm on February 14, Times Now broadcast \u2018breaking news\u2019 on The Newshour Debate about a terrorist attack on a police station located in Shopian district, Jammu and Kashmir. \u201cAs we are talking, if you set aside your politics, then, I want to inform you that terrorists have attacked a police station in Shopian. That\u2019s the latest coming in from there. What do we see in our studio, we see once again warring politicians. Sohail joins me on the phone-line.\u201d, said Times Now anchor Navika Kumar at 34:00 mins in the video posted below.\n\nThe reporter on the phone-line said, \u201cWe have talked about this incident, this has happened in Keegam area of Shopian where a grenade was lobbed on the police station followed by firing. But the police personnel who were deployed at the police station retaliated back and the area is under cordon. Meanwhile, the security forces have also launched coordinated search operations in 15 villages of Pulwama and this is being seen in the backdrop of the attack that took place today on the National Highway 44 in Awantipora area of Kashmir valley.\u201d\n\nNo such attack took place\n\nA senior police official of the Shopian district called out the \u201cfake news\u201d propagated by Times Now.\u201cKindly avoid whatsapp driven fake news cycle @TimesNow like the attack on Keegam PP in Shopian. No such attack took place. @JmuKmrPolice @KashmirPolice\u201d,tweeted the Senior Superintendent of Police Sandeep Chaudhary.\n\nIn a reply to Chaudhary, Times Now clarified with a tweet saying that the news report was unverified and the error is regretted. However, it may be noted that the broadcast video with the misinformation has not been deleted yet.\n\nEarlier, the channel had issued a clarification on Twitter without referring to their misreport.\n\nNews Nation too reported, \u201cAmid growing rage over Pulwama blast, there are reports of another terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s Shopian district.\u201d\n\nIt may be noted that News Nation has not issued a clarification yet.\n\nAt 9:49 pm, ABP News also reported that militants had attacked the \u2018Keegam police station.\u2019\n\nMedia outlets put out the news story without due diligence. As it turned out, the news report about a terrorist attack on a police station in Shopian district was called out by Jammu and Kashmir police. While Times Now has issued a clarification, News Nation and ABP are yet to acknowledge their error.", "lang": "en"}
