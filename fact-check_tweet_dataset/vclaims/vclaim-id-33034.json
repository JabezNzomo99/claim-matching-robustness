(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe reached out to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute about the post. Melissa Giller, the organization\u2019s chief marketing officer, told us that they searched all of their archival records and couldn\u2019t find a reference to the quote.\n\nSearching online we also couldn\u2019t find a credible source attributing it to Reagan, though in 1983 he told the NRA he would \"never disarm any American who seeks to protect his or her family from fear and harm,\" according to Newsweek.\n\nBut several sources, like The Collegian, Walla Walla University\u2019s student newspaper in Washington state, cited German philosopher Karl Marx as the author of the Facebook post quote.\n\nAccording to the Collected Works of Karl Marx, he said it during an 1850 address to the Communist League in London.\n\nThe Facebook post is wrong, so we rate its claim False.", "lang": "en"}
