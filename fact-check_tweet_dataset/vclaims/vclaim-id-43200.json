The safety measures is depriving the children to explore their capacity to percieve the world. I think these is the area I want the government to consider.\u201d\n\nA reader sent the graphic to Rappler\u2019s email for verification. Claim Check, Facebook\u2019s monitoring tool, also spotted at least 22 users on Facebook that posted the graphic. The earliest was shared on March 19.\n\nThe facts: Pangilinan did not say the quote attributed to him. News5 also said the graphic did not come from any of their official social media accounts.\n\nOn March 19, News5 posted on its official social media accounts a quote card of Pangilinan where he suggested the mobilization of the reserve force of the Armed Forces of the Philippines to assist in the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. There was no mention of children in the original quote.\n\nRappler also reached out to the Facebook page that shared the earliest post available online to ask for its source, but the page did not respond.\n\nPangilinan is not the first politician targeted by fake quotes about the coronavirus crisis. Other personalities that became victims of fake quotes were Vice President Leni Robredo and Senator Risa Hontiveros. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
