On September 7, ISRO made news again after an eventful landing of the Vikram lander \u2013 which ended in a deviation from trajectory and loss of communications with the lander.\n\nFacebook page 'With RG' posted the edited graphic with a caption saying: \" \n\nThe Sycophant is at its peak. \" The post has been shared over one thousand times at the time of writing this article.\n\nIt has also been shared by Twitter users taking a dig at the channel.\n\nCloser inspection of the image shows it bears a watermark of 'Memerao'. BOOM found the handle @Memerao1 on Twitter. Tweets from the account make it clear that the image has been photoshopped.\n\nRubika Liyaquat herself took to Twitter to call out the misleading graphic.", "lang": "en"}
