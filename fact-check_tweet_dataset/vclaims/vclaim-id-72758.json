I am hopeful the sanctions will be reversed.\"\n\nWe decided to take a closer look at the idea that it\u2019s \"wrong to sanction a university which has been cleared of involvement.\" Was MU really cleared of all involvement?\n\n\"The NCAA report points to MU\u2019s 'prompt acknowledgement of the violation' by the MU administration once it was discovered,\" Swick said. The NCAA also made note of MU\u2019s \"exemplary cooperation,\" she said. Says the Atlanta mayor is \u201cshutting the city down for\u201d the NBA All-Star Game weekend.\n\n\"They haven\u2019t really done anything in terms of intentional conduct,\" said Justin Sievert, founding partner of Sievert Werly and head of the firm\u2019s college sports law practice. \"But has Missouri been cleared of all involvement? Not in other senses, no. he violations themselves show that they had involvement even if it wasn\u2019t intentional conduct.\"\n\nChristian Dennie, an attorney who works with clients in the sports industry, said institutions can be sanctioned under the NCAA structure because they are responsible for their own employees.\n\nDennie points out that university policy means that Kumar would have been educated on the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of her position as tutor and chose independently to violate them and NCAA policies.\n\nThat responsibility could change if MU considers Kumar a \"rogue employee,\" said Roger Cossack, a former legal analyst for ESPN. But he said that might not make a difference if the NCAA maintains that MU should have known about the misconduct.\n\n\"Yes, Missouri certainly wasn\u2019t asking her to do this, but they had continued responsibility to monitor her actions,\" he said. \"Once you find that she\u2019s a rogue employee, or someone who was not following orders, that just doesn\u2019t mean the university had no responsibility; they have an obligation to be the checks and balances on these things, which is why they have these sanctions.\"\n\nHowever, experts pointed out that due to the sanctions MU faces, the university was still not given the ultimate all-clear as Hartzler said in her original statement. The NCAA still believed MU held the responsibility to monitor its staff, resulting in the sanctions.", "lang": "en"}
