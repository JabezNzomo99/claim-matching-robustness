Two of the judges work ad hoc for an institution separate to the EU\u2014the European Court of Human Rights\u2014but they earn nowhere near as much as \u00a3175,000 from this. The UK\u2019s Supreme Court is a member of the network the claim mentions.\n\nThe judges are not getting \u00a3175,000+ pay cheques from the EU\n\nTwo of the Supreme Court judges (Lady Arden and Lord Reed) are ad hoc judges of the European Court of Human Rights. The Supreme Court told us Lord Carnwath and Lord Kerr had also been ad hoc judges.\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights told us ad hoc judges get paid \u20ac501 (around \u00a3444) per day they spend in court, and they are not paid for preparation days. The court added that \u201cone of the two judges\u2026 has never actually come to the Court while the other has only been here twice in the last four years.\u201d So it doesn\u2019t seem plausible that this work could have earned them as much as the post claims.\n\nIt\u2019s also crucial to point out that, as we\u2019ve written before, the European Court of Human Rights is not part of the EU\u2019s legal system. It is separate from the Court of Justice of the European Union, which is responsible for making sure EU member countries comply with EU laws. The European Court of Human Rights doesn\u2019t have the same members as the EU\u2014for example, it includes Russia.\n\nBut where did the claim come from?\n\nSome of the tweets say the claim comes from \u201cthe Law Gazette\u201d.\n\nWe think that stems from the claim having been made in the comments section underneath an online Law Society Gazette article on the Supreme Court decision that the prorogation of parliament was unlawful. The comment was not made within the article itself.\n\nThe Law Society Gazette\u2019s Web Content Editor confirmed to us that such a comment\u2014about the judges receiving a \u00a3175,000 stipend from the EU and the supreme court being a member of the network of the Presidents of the Supreme Judicial Courts of the EU\u2014was posted under the article in question, and \u201chas since been removed\u201d.\n\nThe Supreme Court, as an institution, is a member of an EU network for member states\u2019 supreme courts\n\nThe UK\u2019s Supreme Court is a member of the Network of the Presidents of the Supreme Judicial Courts of the European Union. This network is not a court in itself, but a group of the Supreme Courts of EU member states (and some observer states). They exchange ideas, discuss matters of common interest, and give their opinions to European institutions.", "lang": "en"}
