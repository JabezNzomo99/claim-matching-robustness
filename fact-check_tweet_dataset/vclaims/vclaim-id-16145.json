The meme claimed that the Nazi newspaper had done the same.\n\nBut the caption of the meme is incorrect. The people shown in Illustrierter Beobachter weren\u2019t judges, and the subtitle doesn\u2019t read \u201cget out of the way of the German Common People\u2019s will\u201d.\n\nThe Nazi newspaper published pictures of what it called \u201cVolksverr\u00e4ter ausgesto\u00dfen aus der Deutschen Volksgemeinschaft\u201d (\u201ctraitors of the people, pushed out of the German people\u2019s community\u201d), and explains that the citizenship of these 33 \u201ctraitors\u201d had been revoked.\n\nThe accompanying text says that all of them were already outside Germany by this time, according to German academic Christian Odendahl.\n\nThe list included journalists, political activists and lawyers, and we\u2019ve republished it below.\n\nThe Twitter user who first posted the comparison, Dr Ned Richardson-Little, didn\u2019t claim that the German paper showed judges. He pointed us to sources for the headline and the names of the \u2018traitors\u2019, which we\u2019ve republished below.\n\nDr Richardson-Little invited his followers to \u2018compare and contrast\u2019 the two images.\n\nIt seems that the original tweet was misunderstood, amended and re-tweeted with the incorrect caption.\n\nWe originally named the German newspaper as the V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter. We have corrected that to Illustrierter Beobachter.", "lang": "en"}
