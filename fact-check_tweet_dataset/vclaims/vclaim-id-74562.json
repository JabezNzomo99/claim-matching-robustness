Jeb Bush -- a Republican presidential candidate -- pointed the finger at former President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration for a law that he said banned the carrying of guns by military recruiters.\n\nThe shootings took place at two sites -- a military recruiting office in a strip mall and a Navy Operational Support Center. The gunman -- , 24, a native of Kuwait who had lived in Tennessee for most of his life -- was shot dead by police. Authorities are investigating the killings but haven\u2019t yet confirmed a terrorist motive.\n\nSpeaking at a Carson City, Nev., on July 17, Bush said, \"A law was passed, apparently in the Clinton administration, about whether, in recruiting offices \u2026 Marines or other military should be able to have guns. Apparently it is prohibited.\"\n\nBush was one of several Republican candidates to call for an end to such a gun prohibition. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, another GOP presidential candidate, also pointed at Clinton.\n\nBush\u2019s claim raised two questions for us: Are guns prohibited at recruiting offices? And if so, is that due to a law passed under President Clinton?\n\nPolicies about guns and the military\n\nAs it turns out, there is a policy that\u2019s relevant here -- but it\u2019s not as straightforward as Bush suggests, and it wasn\u2019t written under Clinton. It stemmed from an effort under Bush\u2019s father, then-President George H.W. Bush.\n\nIn 1992, when Bush was president, the Department of Defense issued a related to firearms for military personnel. That directive replaced an earlier one from 1986. The directive doesn\u2019t specifically address recruiting offices, but it applies broadly to military sites.\n\nThe 1992 directive, signed by then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald Atwood, didn\u2019t outright ban military personnel from carrying weapons. Instead, it said that only certain employees could carry weapons, including those who worked in law enforcement, security and prisons. The directive also did not apply in certain situations, such as in war zones.\n\nThe policy explains that the intent is \"to limit and control the carrying of firearms by DoD military and civilian personnel.\" So the policy did cover most military personnel.\n\nThose who have opposed this policy have sometimes referred to it as a Clinton-era policy because the Army did release a that implemented the Defense Department directive in March 1993, two months after Clinton took office. (For more on a similar claim that circulated after a mass shooting at the Washington, D.C., Navy Yard, see the fact-checking website .)\n\nA new Defense Department directive issued in after a mass shooting at Ft. Hood in Texas tweaked the policy with some new phrases, including that workers have an \"inherent right to self-defense.\" However, the overall policy essentially remained the same. Here is part of that directive:\n\n\"Arming DoD personnel (i.e., administrative, assessment, or inspection, not regularly engaged in or directly supervising security or law enforcement activities) shall be limited to missions or threats and the immediate need to protect DoD assets or persons\u2019 lives. DoD Components have the discretion to keep designated staff personnel qualified and available or on call to perform duties.\"\n\nThe recruiting office where the shooting occurred represented all four branches of the military. We could not reach a spokesperson for the Marines. However Brian Lepley, a spokesman for U.S. Army Recruiting Command, said that \"weapons are not permitted in recruiting stations by DoD because there are no law enforcement personnel there.\"\n\nMany on the Internet noted the on the military recruiting office door.\n\n\"Once you cross that door, you are not allowed to have a weapon in there,\" Lepley said.\n\nSo should we blame Clinton -- or any president -- for the Department of Defense directive?\n\n\"No, I wouldn\u2019t,\" said Richard Brennan, a senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation and a career Army officer. \"And frankly I\u2019m unaware of any statute that prevents military personnel from carrying weapons. What there has been at least since 1975 when I was a cadet were policies and regulations that govern the circumstances under which military personnel can carry weapons.\"\n\nOver the years, those policies have consistently said that personnel working as law enforcement and protecting life or federal property can carry firearms.\n\n\"There hasn\u2019t been marked change in this,\" he said.\n\nWhile a president could get involved in this level of detail if they wanted to, this is generally settled at a lower pay grade. Such directives are \"internally generated by a need seen either within civilian military leadership or military leadership,\" Brennan said. Typically, they update earlier policies, he added.\n\nSteven Bucci, a military expert for the Heritage Foundation and former Army colonel, told PolitiFact that the policy about firearms existed for decades before Clinton, or Bush for that matter.\n\n\"As far back as when I joined the military in 1973, and probably further back, you have never been able to carry firearms, privately owned or government, on military installations. You always had to register it with the MP's and keep them locked in the arms rooms,\" he said, referring to military police.\n\nBucci has disputed that President Clinton \"disarmed\" the military.\n\n\"No one \u2018disarmed\u2019 the military -- the military itself prefers to manage good order and discipline by not having everyone armed,\" he told PolitiFact.\n\nIn the wake of the shooting rampage in Tennessee, several lawmakers have said they plan to introduce bills to get rid of the military directive about firearms. Then-Rep. Steve Stockman, R-Texas, introduced a in 2013 to repeal the Defense Department directive and prohibit the military from instituting any restrictions on guns. But it never received a vote.\n\nWe sent a summary of our findings about the defense directives to a spokeswoman for Bush. She reiterated his viewpoint.\n\n\"The Clinton administration implemented this policy to prohibit guns in military recruitment offices,\" said Allie Brandenburger. \"Gov. Bush believes military recruiters should be allowed to carry guns.\"\n\nBush said that \"a law was passed, apparently in the Clinton administration, about whether, in recruiting offices \u2026 Marines or other military should be able to have guns. Apparently it is prohibited.\"\n\nThe Department of Defense issued a directive, not a law, in 1992 -- when Bush\u2019s father was president. It did not ban firearms outright; it limited them to military personnel who held certain jobs, such as positions in law enforcement. And while the Army issued a regulation implementing that directive in 1993 -- two months after Clinton was in office -- experts say it is not the sort of matter that would typically rise to the attention of a president.\n\nBush has a point that, for the most part, military personnel can\u2019t have firearms at recruiting offices. But most of everything else he said was incorrect. We rate this claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
