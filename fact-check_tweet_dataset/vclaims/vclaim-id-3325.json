Yet, as Mikhail Saakashvili \u2026 leads thousands of angry demonstrators around the streets of Kiev, the same outlets turn a blind eye,\u201d he says.\n\nHe concludes that the papers toe the line of the U.S. government, which \u201cdespises\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s administration but supports that of Ukraine\u2019s Petro Poroshenko.\n\nContrary to MacDonald\u2019s claims, neither the New York Times, the Washington Post, nor a multitude of other western outlets other than the CNN have ignored the events in Kyiv.\n\nThe NYT and the WP indeed did not cover them on the front pages. But they did report on them in regional sections and have done so consistently before, on, and after December 5.\n\nAndrew Higgins with The NYT wrote on the events on December 5 and December 8.\n\nSo did David L. Stern and Rick Noack of The WP, who covered the issues on December 5.\n\nMoreover, both The NYT and The WP have run numerous stories on the ongoing events by wire services, such as the Associated Press, most recently on December 10 and 11.\n\nPresident Poroshenko had appointed Saakashvili as Governor of Odessa in 2015, but Saakashvili resigned a year later alleging extensive corruption within the government. Ukrainian authorities stripped Saakashvili of his Ukrainian passport while he was out of the country last summer. After some absence, Saakashvili returned to Ukraine crossing the border with Poland and has since led anti-government protests in Kyiv.\n\nOn December 5, Ukrainian authorities attempted to arrest Saakashvili as part of an investigation into his alleged collaboration with criminal groups and, as the Associated Press reports, with Ukrainian businessmen who allegedly are tied to the Russian government in an alleged plot to topple Poroshenko. However, Saakashvili\u2019s supporters prevented the arrest, which eventually occurred on December 8. Saaskashvili denies claims he is collaborating with pro-Russian elements, given Saakashvili\u2019s role as president in the events leading to the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008.\n\nOn December 11, next day after thousands rallied in Kyiv in Saakashvili\u2019s support and demanding the impeachment of President Poroshenko, a judge released Saakashvili, despite the general prosecutor\u2019s call for his house arrest, in a move seen as a victory for the opposition-turned figure.\n\nRT does not have a detailed biography of MacDonald other than that he is an Irish journalist in Russia. Polygraph.info has previously done a fact-check on a story MacDonald penned for RT regarding Russia\u2019s military threat to the West, and similarly debunked that claim.\n\nNot much information is available about him online, either. However, Polygraph.info did locate an article, more an expose, by the Interpreter claiming that MacDonald \u201chas been working for many months to influence more respectable Western outlets\u2019 coverage of the crisis in Ukraine.\u201d MacDonald, it says, \u201chas resorted to means both subtle and not-so-subtle.\u201d The article goes on to note that MacDonald focuses on engaging with journalists \u201cwho shape the way the conflict in Ukraine is being reported,\u201d presenting this graphic of associations:\n\nPolygraph.info has not investigated the claims contained in the Interpreter\u2019s report.", "lang": "en"}
