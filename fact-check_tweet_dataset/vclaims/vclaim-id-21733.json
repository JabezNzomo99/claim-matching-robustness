But one expert and Russian agency literature say the system known as Glonass was originally designed for military purposes and has dual use capabilities including military surveillance.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "April 12, 2017", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-21733", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/glonass-nicaragua-russia-surveillance-us/28424106.html", "vclaim": "On April 6, Russia commissioned a ground tracking system in Nicaragua to help monitor the movement of 24 satellites in space belonging to a Russian system known as Glonass.\n\nAt a dedication ceremony, officials from both countries said the tracking station will help the Central American nation improve agriculture projects, aviation navigation, and promote scientific research.\n\n\u201cThis station is very important for Nicaragua and Central America as a whole,\u201d Nicaraguan President Laureano Ortega said. \u201cThe use of the data will enrich all areas of industry and science of Nicaragua.\u201d\n\nThe deputy general director of Roscosmos, Sergey Saveliev, told the Russian government news agency RIA on April 7 that the goal is to create a global net of Glonass stations positioned in more than 30 countries, with a special focus on the Americas and the Arctic.\n\nDays later, the Washington Post said \u201ccurrent and former U.S. officials suspect\u201d the tracking station in Managua \u201ccould have \u2018dual use\u2019 capabilities, particularly for electronic espionage aimed at the United States.\u201d\n\nIn response to the Post report, Vladimir Shamanov, Chairman of the State Duma's Defense Committee and a former commander of Russian forces in Chechnya, said the suggestion that the tracking station is used for spying is \u201cabsurd and fiction designed for an untrained layman.\"\n\nBut his comments ignore a description of the satellite system\u2019s military capabilities posted on the website of the Russian government agency Roscosmos, which oversees and manages Glonass.\n\n\u201cGlonass bares special significance to the effectiveness of tasks of the military forces\u2026including the use of highly precise weapons, drones and operation command of the Army,\u201d Roscosmos said.\n\nThe Russian entity NIS that operates Glonass describes it as \u201chigh-intelligence product of the military-industrial complex\u201d and \u201ca global strategic means for insuring national security.\u201d\n\nIt also states that Glonass \u2013 an abbreviation of Global Navigation Satellite System \u2013 was originally developed in the 1970s as a Soviet era military intelligence system and \u201cadopted as a national defense operational unit since the mid-1990s.\u201d\n\nToday, Glonass according to NIS, has a wide sphere of usage, including \u201cgeodetic survey and location of geographic objects with centimeter accuracy\u201d and \u201csynchronization in communication systems, telecommunications and electric power industry.\u201d\n\nNIS touts Glonass as \u201can outstanding example of how technologies initially developed for military applications can be adopted for the civilian sector\u201d and says citizens of the world can use it for free.\n\n\u201cGlonass systems have become strategic global means of ensuring national security and economic development,\u201d NIS said in its technical description.\n\nAs to whether Glonass can be used as a spy system, one expert says Russia\u2019s Shamanov is shading the truth when it comes to Glonass\u2019s capabilities as it relates to intelligence gathering.\n\nJames Lewis, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in Washington told Polygraph.info: \u201cHe\u2019s being a little fast and loose. The new Russian ground station that they\u2019ve put in Nicaragua, of course, could be used to manage Glonass and could be used for intelligence purposes.\u201d\n\nStill, Lewis said Russia\u2019s technology is \u201cprimitive\u201d and far behind the West and China to cause any serious concerns about spying on the United States.\n\n\u201cThe Russian space intelligence system has been in decline for decades,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were using the old Soviet satellites until recently. The Russians still have primitive technology. So in order to manage Glonass, they need to put in a lot of ground stations around the world.\n\n\u201cThe thing is if they build a ground Glonass station, which is a building with antennas and receivers \u2013 can they use it to spy on the U.S.?\u201d Lewis asked. \u201cAnd the answer is: yes, maybe, if they are desperate.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
