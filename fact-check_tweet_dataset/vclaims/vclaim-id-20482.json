So we looked into the recent spin on health-care figures from the White House. As readers will see, in most instances, the White House used accurate figures but characterized them in misleading ways or out of context.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to make simple comparisons to data from pre-Obamacare plans in 2013. The number of people who qualify for health insurance, and the type of insurance they get, are much different under the ACA than in 2013, before the change. One study found that when adjusting for actuarial value to create an apples-to-apples comparison, individual-market premiums actually dropped after the introduction of the ACA.\n\nIn addition, this does not take into account the impact of premium tax credits, which shield 84 percent of people in the exchanges from premium hikes. On average, eight out of 10 marketplace enrollees receive government premium subsidies, and they are protected from a premium increase (and may even see a decrease) if they stay with a low-cost plan.\n\nThe number of issuers varies widely between states. In 2014, an average of five insurers participated in each state\u2019s marketplace, ranging from one to 16 companies in a state. The average number for 2017 is 4.3, ranging from one to 15 companies in a state, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Still, the White House noted: \u201cIn 2014, 191 issuers offered plans on healthcare.gov. Only 167 issuers offered plans during 2017 open enrollment \u2014 a 13 percent decline from 2014.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that before the ACA, many rural areas only had one or two carriers. After the exchanges, companies jumped into the market in 2015 and 2016 after the exchanges launched \u2014 then left the market after realizing the exchanges weren\u2019t profitable yet. So many states in 2017 are back to the same number of issuers there were in 2014 \u2014 which does not necessarily mean there are \u201cfewer choices.\u201d\n\nThe gradual attrition rate over the course of the year is close to the 2015 rate, notes Charles Gaba, who keeps careful track of enrollment figures at ACASignups.net. Moreover, this statistic ignores that more people are covered under the ACA, and the expansion of Medicaid provided insurance to as many as 14 million people. (The White House disputed our point about Medicaid: \u201cThe stat specifically refers to Obamacare\u2019s exchanges and does not mention Medicaid.\u201d)\n\n\n\nDid they pay penalties because the plans \u201cdid not meet their needs\u201d or because they couldn\u2019t afford them? It\u2019s not clear. Those who truly can\u2019t afford insurance can claim a hardship exemption from the penalty. A 2016 Kaiser Family Foundation survey showed that two-thirds of marketplace enrollees were satisfied with their coverage, and 59 percent said it was easy to find a plan that met their needs.\n\nWe\u2019ve debunked the 2 million statistic before. It comes from a dubious report issued by Health and Human Services, which found 10.3 million had paid for their first premium in February as of March 15, compared with 12.2 million who had signed up for coverage as of Jan. 31, 2017. (This is similar to the earlier claim about 3.6 million dropping off the exchanges by the end of 2016.)\n\nBut the HHS report excludes data from March 15-31, which was usually included in previous versions of the report. Such reports, even ones issued earlier than June 12, included data through March 31. In virtually every state, people signing up for coverage between Jan. 15-31 do not even pay a first premium until March. Gaba estimates that leaves off about 500,000 people. Using enrollment as of Jan. 31 rather than enrollment through Jan. 15 also serves to inflate the purported decline.\n\nAverage insurance premiums in the Obamacare marketplace now are about at the level predicted by the Congressional Budget Office for 2017 when it first evaluated the law in 2009. But premiums have certainly spiked in recent years, as insurance companies grappled with a mix of people in the insurance pools tilted toward people who have chronic illnesses and thus require more care and frequent doctor or hospital visits.\n\n\n\nThe White House frequently tries to discredit CBO estimates by criticizing their previous estimates, but this is misleading. The CBO was mostly correct on its forecast for the overall number of 23 million people who would gain insurance under Obamacare. The CBO was off in its projection is the makeup of the type of insurance gained in the total 23 million population.\n\nThat is only a subset of the number of people who gained insurance. The CBO underestimated the number of people who would gain insurance through Medicaid expansions, due to factors that were unknown at the time. More people than projected signed up for Medicaid \u2014 14.4 million, compared to the projected 10 million. That adds up to 24.8 million total people who gained coverage through Obamacare.", "lang": "en"}
