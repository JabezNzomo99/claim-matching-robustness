The picture is available via Getty Images with the following caption:\n\nA pin, used for training purposes, is placed on the collar of a Chinese paramilitary policeman undergoing a drill to prepare for the upcoming National People\u2019s Congress (NPC) in Beijing on February 28, 2012. China\u2019s parliament, the National People\u2019s Congress, is set to open its annual session on March 5. CHINA OUT AFP PHOTO (Photo credit should read STR/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWhile this is a genuine photograph of a pin being used to correct posture, this is not a training method that all soldiers have to endure. A 2009 article from The New York Times indicated that this is a corrective measure for soldiers whose postures aren\u2019t up to standards (emphasis ours):\n\nThe Olympics that dazzled spectators last year showed China\u2019s knack for meticulous preparation. Participants in the Thursday parade have engaged in similarly intense drills for months, according to reports in the Chinese news media. Soldiers have practiced endless hours to hold their rifles at precisely the same level. Photos show their instructors holding threads as rifle guides, or sticking needles in soldiers\u2019 shirt collars, pointed at their necks, to correct poor posture. They have trained to stand motionless for a solid hour, to refrain from swaying during the second hour and not to collapse after three hours, reported Xinhua, the state-run news agency.\n\nWe found one other photograph from Getty Images showing a Chinese officer with a pin being placed in his collar in an attempt to correct posture.
