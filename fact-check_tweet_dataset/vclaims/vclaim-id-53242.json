One was whether the president had flubbed the pronunciation of the Italian president\u2019s name.\n\nOthers claimed that Trump had said the United States and Italy had been allies since the era of ancient Rome.\n\nBut Trump never actually claimed that.\n\nIt would clearly be wrong because the U.S. was only founded as an independent nation in 1776, and Italy was only unified in the 19th century, becoming a republic in the 1940s.\n\nWhat Trump actually said, in his opening remarks during the press conference, was as follows:\n\n\u201cThe United States and Italy are bound together by a shared cultural and political heritage dating back thousands of years, to ancient Rome \u2026\u201d\n\nTrump said the two countries share a political and cultural heritage, and that that heritage dates back thousands of years. He did not claim that the two countries have shared an alliance for thousands of years \u2014 something that would have required both nations to exist as polities during the era of the Roman Empire, which clearly neither did.\n\nThe phrase \u201cdating back thousands of years\u201d evidently caused many commentators to misunderstand the meaning of Trump\u2019s remarks. But it\u2019s the heritage that goes back that far, not the binding of the two nations.\n\nThe influence of the Roman Republic on the formation and principles of the American Republic is well-documented, and Trump\u2019s point was historically sound.\n\nSee for yourself:", "lang": "en"}
