Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nWhen searched about the double-decker Sydney metro train on Google, the same video was found to be uploaded on YouTube in 2018 whereas the metro trains made in India by the Alstom company began operations only in May 2019. While it is true that 22 \u2018Made in India\u2019 trains manufactured at Alstom\u2019s Sricity facility (Andhra Pradesh) were delivered to Sydney Metro, the train in the video is not one of them. On the Sydney Metro website, it can be seen that the design of the metro coaches made in India is very different from the train design shown in the video. Also, the coaches manufactured in India by Alstom were single-decker, not double-decker.\n\nAlso, in the search results, it was found that the double-decker train in the video is called \u2018Waratah Series\u2019. When looked for more about Waratah trains, it was found that the first CityRail double-decker built by \u2018Reliance Rail\u2019 (not Indian \u2018Reliance\u2019 company) was delivered in 2009. According to an article in Railway Gazette, the manufacturing process was done at China Northern\u2019s Changchun plant and Downer EDI Rail\u2019s plant (in Cardiff). Further details about the Waratah trains can be read here.\n\nTo sum it up, the double-decker train in the video was not \u2018Made in India\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
