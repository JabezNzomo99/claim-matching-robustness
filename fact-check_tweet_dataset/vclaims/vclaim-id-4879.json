Trump likes to take credit for the increased spending by NATO countries, but he cannot say that \u201cprior to last year \u2026 the amount of money being spent by countries was going down and down very substantially.\u201d\n\nNATO Countries Don\u2019t Owe Money to the U.S.\n\nA day earlier at a breakfast meeting, Trump wrongly claimed that NATO countries that have not been spending 2 percent of GDP for defense owe the U.S. \u201ca tremendous amount of money.\u201d\n\nBut Trump is again referring to the amount of money that countries independently decide to spend on their own defense budgets. There is no requirement that countries that spend less than 2 percent of GDP on defense reimburse those countries that do.\n\nThe president\u2019s statement \u201cis not accurate,\u201d Christopher Preble, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, told us in an email.\n\n\u201cNATO countries do not owe the United States money. And the commitment they made to reach the 2% of GDP threshold was to have done so by 2024,\u201d Preble wrote. \u201cNATO member states fund their own militaries. They don\u2019t pay us to fund ours,\u201d he said.\n\nIn fact, for the majority of the 29 countries in the alliance, the 2 percent of GDP benchmark is just a \u201cguideline,\u201d not a mandate.\n\nWhen NATO leaders originally committed in 2006 to try to spend that much on their own defense, a NATO spokesman made it clear that \u201cthis is not a hard commitment that they will do it. \u2026 But it is a commitment to work towards it.\u201d And a 2014 press release about the Wales summit said that countries again agreed to either \u201caim to continue\u201d spending that amount or \u201caim to move towards the 2% guideline within a decade.\u201d\n\nAs of 2018, only four members of the alliance \u201chave either national laws or political agreements which call for at least 2% of GDP to be spent on defence annually,\u201d according to NATO. They are Latvia, Poland, Lithuania and Romania.\n\nTrump repeatedly claimed that \u201ceveryone has agreed to substantially up their commitment.\u201d But leaders of several European nations later said there were no formal agreements to increase spending beyond previously set goals, and none was provided by NATO.\n\nAsked during a press conference for details about new commitments agreed to at the summit, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said only that everyone \u201cdeveloped a better common understanding of the challenges, the urgency of spending more\u201d and that allies had promised to \u201credouble their efforts\u201d to increasing defense spending.\n\nHowever, Trump left the impression that specific new commitments for funding had been agreed upon.\n\n\u201cEveryone has agreed to substantially up their commitment,\u201d Trump said in the press conference after the summit. \u201cThey\u2019re going to up it at levels that they\u2019ve never thought of before.\u201d\n\nLater, Trump said, \u201cEverybody in that room, by the time we left, got along. And they agreed to pay more, and they agreed to pay it more quickly.\u201d\n\nIn the past, funding commitments were only an \u201camorphous number\u201d and a \u201cgoal,\u201d but now, he said, they are \u201ca real commitment.\u201d\n\nAs we explained, in 2006, NATO members agreed to try to spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense spending. And in 2014, they agreed again to aim to meet that standard by 2024.\n\nAfter the summit, several NATO leaders said no new commitments had been made that would alter those agreements.\n\n\u201cI made clear that we know that we have to do more and that we have been doing so for quite a while,\u201d German Chancellor Angela Merkel said. \u201cThat turning point has long been initiated. \u2026 The American president has demanded, what has been discussed for months, that the burden-sharing has to change. And we made clear, well, I made clear for myself and others also made it clear, that we are on this path, which is in our own interest and can make us overall stronger.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt confirms the goal of 2 percent by 2024. That\u2019s all,\u201d said French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\n\u201cEveryone agreed to raise spending as they agreed in 2014, and everyone agreed to respect the commitments they made,\u201d Macron said. \u201cWe reaffirmed a credible budget strategy that meets our needs.\u201d\n\nAnd, Bloomberg reported, \u201cItaly has no plans to change its defense spending plans as a result of the summit, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told reporters. Italy has focused more on targets other than the 2 percent goal, such as increasing its participation in NATO missions. \u2018It isn\u2019t just an accounting issue,\u2019 Conte said.\u201d\n\nAccording to NATO figures, Germany, France and Italy spend 1.24 percent, 1.81 percent and 1.15 percent of their annual GDP on defense, respectively.\n\nIn a press conference after the summit, a reporter for the Washington Post asked Stoltenberg for details on any new commitments agreed to in the meetings.\n\nStoltenberg replied generally that everyone \u201cdeveloped a better common understanding of the challenges, the urgency of spending more, and allies committed to spending and to investing in our shared security.\u201d\n\nA reporter from the Financial Times tried again, asking, \u201cOn the substance, can you confirm then that nothing was agreed this morning either formally or informally that commits member states to going beyond the Wales 2 percent target or indeed any other commitments?\u201d\n\nStoltenberg similarly replied: \u201cWe have made conclusions at this summit which confirms our support for NATO, the importance of investing more and all our allies agreed that we need to deliver on our commitments. There is a new sense of urgency. And all allies agreed to redouble their efforts.\u201d\n\nWhile the Summit Declaration issued after this year\u2019s meeting continued to refer to the goal that 2 percent of GDP be spent on defense by 2024, Stoltenberg did highlight one small change. \u201cInitiated by President Trump, last year, we agreed to develop national plans,\u201d Stoltenberg said. \u201cWe have clearly stated this year that we need credible national plans, and I expect all allies to follow up on their national plans. And the national plans are a very valuable tool to make sure that we deliver, and that we increase defense spending substantially.\u201d\n\nTrump repeated several other inaccurate claims that we have written about before.\n\u2022 Trump repeated the inaccurate claim that the U.S. is paying \u201cprobably 90 percent of the cost of NATO.\u201d But as we wrote recently, the U.S. share of the commonly funded NATO budget is just over 22 percent, according to NATO\u2019s most recent figures. Trump is conflating the cost of operating NATO with the amount NATO countries spend on their own defense, which for most is below 2 percent of GDP. The U.S. share of total defense spending by all NATO members in 2017 was an estimated 67 percent, according to inflation-adjusted figures from NATO.\n\u2022 Trump again wrongly claimed that Wisconsin was the one state Ronald Reagan lost in 1984. \u201cOne of the states we won, Wisconsin \u2014 I didn\u2019t even realize this until fairly recently \u2014 that was the one state that Ronald Reagan didn\u2019t win when he ran the board his second time,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t win Wisconsin, and we won Wisconsin.\u201d In fact, Reagan won Wisconsin in 1980 and again in 1984, and pretty handily at that.\n\u2022 And finally, Trump repeated the claim that he opposed the Iraq war before it started. \u201cI was not in favor of that war,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI was very much against that war. I never thought it was a good thing. But that\u2019s another deck of cards that I inherited, and we\u2019ll do the best we can with it.\u201d As we wrote many times during the 2016 campaign, there\u2019s no evidence he publicly opposed the war before it started, though there is some evidence he supported it.", "lang": "en"}
