But nowhere in these notebooks, which were edited and translated by German art scholar Jean Paul Richter, is the quote ascribed to him in the Facebook post to be found.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very suspicious of it because I\u2019ve never seen anything like it in Leonardo\u2019s writings,\u201d Ross King, author of \u201cLeonardo and the Last Supper,\u201d said in an email to TheDCNF. \u201cI did a search in scanned copies of both vols. 1 and 2 \u2026 and neither \u2018simplicity\u2019 nor \u2018sophistication\u2019 appears in either; and even the word \u2018simple\u2019 doesn\u2019t appear in any context where it\u2019s juxtaposed to complexity. These facts, in my view, disqualify the quote, because it\u2019s very difficult to imagine where it would have come from if not the Richter edition.\u201d\n\nThe website Quote Investigator also found no evidence that da Vinci authored the quote. It traced a version of the phrase to the 1931 book \u201cStuffed Shirts\u201d by Clare Boothe Luce. A character in the novel at one point states, \u201cI have resolved to grow old, naturally and gracefully, content in the knowledge that the greatest intellects are the homeliest ones, and that the height of sophistication is simplicity.\u201d\n\nThe phrase, as written in the Facebook post, was also featured without attribution in a 1977 Apple computer brochure.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
