The unofficial memorial was put in place in November 2018, when some members of the public reportedly removed a paving slab near the site where Fusilier Rigby was murdered and replaced it with a memorial stone.\n\nThe Facebook post was published in December 2018. Greenwich Council confirmed to us in January 2019 that it had no plans to remove the memorial stone. A Facebook live video from 24 January appeared to show the memorial stone intact.\n\nSubsequently, in March 2019, Greenwich Council and the family of Lee Rigby made the decision to remove the unofficial memorials and install a new memorial close to the site of his murder.", "lang": "en"}
