Much of the country endured a bitterly cold stretch, causing more people to be crowded together inside. The strain that has been most pervasive, H3N2, is nastier than most. And, we\u2019re being told, the vaccine this year is particularly ineffective.\n\nThat last fact has had many people wondering if they should still get a flu shot. If you read no further in this column, know this: The answer is yes, you should still get a flu shot. The flu season typically peaks December through February but can last until May, and it usually takes about two weeks for the shot\u2019s immunity to kick in.\n\nIt\u2019s worth exploring what we mean by effectiveness when we\u2019re discussing the flu vaccine.\n\nThe flu virus is unstable, and it changes a lot each season. This means that the immunity you gained from a shot a year ago doesn\u2019t work so well this time around. Each summer, scientists gather and try to make a best guess on which variants are going to be more common in the coming year. They look at data from countries like Australia (whose flu season comes before ours), then they make the shot to match.\n\nThis season, the flu vaccine is most protective against an H1NI, an H3N2 and a B/Victoria lineage strain. Some vaccines also protect against a B/Yamagata lineage strain.", "lang": "en"}
