They argue that the BCRA would no longer protect Americans with preexisting conditions, despite the bill\u2019s explicit ban on states waiving coverage based on preexisting conditions. Yet a Republican opponent of the bill criticized it for not repealing the protection enough. What is going on?\n\nThat is not allowed under the ACA, which requires everyone to purchase insurance. It also requires insurance carriers to offer people in the individual and small group markets \u201cessential health benefits,\u201d such as maternity care, mental health services, prescription drugs, pediatric services and emergency services. The goal was to standardize benefits, offer comprehensive coverage and balance out the risk pool. The 10 essential health benefits are minimum coverage requirements, and don\u2019t include services like dental, vision or hearing services for adults.\n\nWhat does the Senate bill say?\n\nBut states couldn\u2019t use the waiver to deny insurance coverage because a person has a preexisting medical condition. According to the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s analysis of the Senate bill, \u201cInsurers would still be required to provide coverage to any applicant, and they would not be able to vary premiums to reflect enrollees\u2019 health status or to limit coverage of preexisting medical conditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs under current law, however, states could not use waivers to change federal regulations relating to preexisting conditions, requiring insurers to offer coverage to any applicant, or requiring that premiums in the nongroup market not be based on an individual\u2019s health (allowing them to vary only on the basis of age, smoking status, and geographic location),\u201d CBO added. \u201cIn addition, under the legislation, states could not use waivers to change regulations related to continuous coverage.\u201d\n\nIf the law passed, people generally would not be affected unless they lived in a state that sought a waiver. Some states could make changes that affect only a small portion of their population. But the CBO estimated that under both the Senate and House bills, about half of the population would be in \u201cstates substantially affected by waivers to provisions of the ACA.\u201d States would have a mechanism to help reduce cost sharing or out-of-pocket costs for people in the individual and small group markets, though it\u2019s unclear how many states would use this method.\n\nIf states aren\u2019t required to ensure that their coverage is as comprehensive as the essential health benefits package, insurers can redesign plans that do not include certain services that otherwise would have been required under the ACA. These services may be ones that people with preexisting conditions need. So even if they have the insurance, they may end up paying out-of-pocket costs for certain services that are not covered under their new plan. However, ultimately, it will be up these states to decide the services they want to cover, and how comprehensive they will be.\n\nFurther, BCRA allows states to waive the single risk pool, which is an ACA requirement for qualified health plans to make sure that the insurer bases premiums on the expected cost of all applicants in the marketplace, not just those who might enroll in a plan. If this is waived, certain plans could become much more expensive for people with preexisting conditions.\n\nFor example, if Plan A does not cover chemotherapy but Plan B does, the insurer would assume that cancer patients would want to enroll in the latter. So the insurer could charge much more for Plan B, based on the costs of those who might enroll in it. The cancer patient could enroll in Plan A and pay for chemotherapy out of pocket, but it would still be expensive.\n\nAs we always say at The Fact Checker, readers should be wary about claims that important changes in health-care coverage would hurt or protect certain people. There will always be winners and losers in a bill that aims to overhaul something as complex and wide-reaching as the U.S. health system. Ultimately, the exact impact will depend on individual decisions at state level among those who seek waivers, and what insurers do in the waiver program.", "lang": "en"}
