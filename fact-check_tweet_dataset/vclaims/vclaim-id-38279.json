This is a six-year-old photo from the Syrian conflict.\n\nMany Facebook users have shared the same photo. The archived version can be seen here.\n\nWith the help of reverse image search, we found the picture on the website of Getty Images.\n\nThe caption along with the image reads, \"A Syrian woman comforts her children after their house in the Sahour nieghbourhood of the northern Syrian city of Aleppo was bombed on May 14, 2014. Once home to some 2.5 million residents and considered Syria's economic powerhouse, Aleppo has been divided between government and opposition control since shortly after fighting there began in mid-2012.\"\n\nAn article in \"The Jordan Times\" dated May 14, 2014, and a picture gallery in \"CBS News\" also carry the same picture, with the claim that it is from the Syria conflict.\n\nIncidentally, in India, the capital Delhi recently witnessed massive violence between two communities. Many fake pictures, videos and claims relating them to the riots are being circulated on social media.\n\nBut it is clear that the viral picture is not from India but Syria.", "lang": "en"}
