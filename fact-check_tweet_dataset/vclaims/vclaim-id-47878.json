Since then, many Facebook users are posting that the deceased man Bandhu Prakash Pal is a BJP worker and the murder is politically motivated. Let\u2019s analyze the authenticity of that claim. \n\n\n\nClaim: Bandhu Prakash Pal, a deceased in Murshidabad triple murder is affiliated to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the murder of his family is politically motivated. Fact: Bandhu Pal\u2019s mother Maya Pal has denied his son\u2019s association with BJP or RSS. Bandhu Pal\u2019s neighbour and BJP district committee leader Manoj Sarkar has said that Pal isn\u2019t associated with any political party. The West Bengal police have said that Prima Facie the case is of personal enmity and it has nothing to do with politics. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nLast week, a School teacher Bandhu Prakash Pal, his pregnant wife Beauty Pal and their son Angan were found dead in their house in Murshidabad. Since then, a political row broke out between BJP and the ruling TMC. BJP is attacking the Bengal government alleging that the deceased Bandhu Pal is their party worker and was killed because of his political links, while Trinamool Congress said that the murder was due to the BJP\u2019s internal feuds. \n\n\n\nIn an interview with \u2018Indian Express\u2019, Bandhu Pal\u2019s mother Maya Pal has said that her son doesn\u2019t have any association with BJP or TMC or RSS. His relatives have also rubbished the claims regarding Bandhu Pal\u2019s association with any of the political parties. \n\n\n\nBandhu Pal\u2019s neighbour and BJP district committee leader Manoj Sarkar has said that Pal neither spoke anything about politics nor was he associated with any political party.\n\n\n\nWhen \u2018Indian Express\u2019 also got in touch with Bengal senior RSS functionary Bidyut Roy, he condemned the murders and said that Pal was in touch with them for the past four months and is a novice. But Roy added that he wouldn\u2019t believe that Pal was murdered because he was in touch with their organization. \n\n\n\nAs the Murshidabad triple murder incident is being shared in a political context, the West Bengal Police have put out a series of tweets insisting that it had nothing to do with politics. \n\n\n\nTo conclude, the deceased in Murshidabad triple murder case is not politically motivated. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
