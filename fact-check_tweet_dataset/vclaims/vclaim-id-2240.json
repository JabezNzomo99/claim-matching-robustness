Our country takes the position that the United States (should) withdraw its troops from Afghanistan; the legitimately elected government of Afghanistan takes principally the same position. U.S. success in the fight against terrorism, especially in Afghanistan, is not particularly discernible.\u201d\u200b\n\nShvytkin was commenting on the U.S. strategy for Afghanistan and the South Asia region that U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled on August 21. Trump said the strategy would focus on \u201cattacking our enemies, obliterating ISIS, crushing al-Qaeda, preventing the Taliban from taking over the country, and stopping mass terror attacks against Americans before they emerge.\u201d\u200b\n\nShortly after the president\u2019s announcement, the special charge d'affaires of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Ambassador Hugo Llorens, issued a statement reaffirming the U.S. commitment to Afghanistan in the fight against terrorism.\u200b\n\n\u201c[W]e will stand by Afghanistan\u2019s side as long as it takes to get the job done,\u201d Llorens said. \u201cSo just understand, the United States is not going anywhere and we will continue to partner with the Government of National Unity and the Afghan people in our common fight against terrorists\u2026 .\u201d\u200b\n\nSignificant challenges remain in countering the more than 20 terrorist groups operating in Afghanistan and the region, ranging from a reduced U.S. military presence and the weak capabilities of the Afghan army to rifts and corruption within the Afghan government.\u200b\n\nHowever, contrary to Shvytkin\u2019s claims, U.S. and Afghan forces have succeeded in degrading Islamic State and preventing the Taliban from overthrowing the Afghan government, which relies on and supports the U.S. military presence.\n\nIndeed, the governor of Afghanistan\u2019s Achin district, Moallem Mashoq, told The Guardian last November: \u201cWithout US or Nato forces, it would take our [Afghan] army and police 10 years to defeat Daesh [Islamic State].\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan announced in March that the U.S.-led coalition and Afghan forces had reduced the IS footprint significantly, shrinking the group\u2019s area by two-thirds and reducing its fighters by half.\n\nIn July, U.S. forces killed the IS leader in Afghanistan in an airstrike on the group\u2019s headquarters there. Pentagon spokesperson Dana White said the strike would \u201csignificantly disrupt the terror group\u2019s plans to expand its presence in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nThe counterterrorism successes have underscored the importance of close security cooperation between the United States and Afghanistan as part of the new U.S. strategy. \u200b\n\nPresident Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, among other Afghan officials, have declared support for the new course and the U.S. presence in their country.\u200b\n\n\u201cI am grateful to President Trump and the American people for this affirmation of support for our efforts to achieve self-reliance and for our joint struggle to rid the region from the threat of terrorism,\u201d Ghani said in a statement made just hours after Trump announced the new strategy.\u200b\n\nHe added: \u201cThe new strategy will increase the capacity in the Resolute Support mission. It will particularly emphasize enhancing the Afghan air power, doubling the size of the Afghan Special Force and deepening NATO\u2019s ability to train, advice and assist Afghan security forces.\u201d\u200b\n\nGhani also affirmed unequivocally his government\u2019s strong support for the U.S. presence.\u200b\n\n\u201cAfter this there is no timeline or time-based condition, the U.S. will stay with the Afghan people up to the end,\u201d he said, calling on anti-government armed groups to join the peace process.\u200b\n\nAbdullah, for his part, described the new strategy as \u201cunique and perfect,\u201d adding: \u201cThe issue of the existence of terrorists\u2019 safe havens and support to Taliban and other terrorist groups has been highlighted very well (in the U.S. strategy) and there are clear messages (in this regard).\u201d\u200b\n\nSecond Vice President Sarwar Danish said the strategy would bring positive change, noting that Afghanistan could be sure that \u201c(o)ur allies are beside us same as before.\u201d\u200b\n\nSalahuddin Rabbani, Afghanistan\u2019s acting foreign minister, expressed hope the strategy would bolster Kabul\u2019s strategic cooperation with Washington to achieve common goals.\u200b\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s Ambassador to the United States, Hamdullah Mohib, emphasized that both Washington and Kabul want a favorable end to the war. He also stressed that the strategy reflected the \u201cneeds and considerations\u201d of both the United States and Afghanistan.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis announced on August 31 that he had ordered the deployment of additional forces to Afghanistan as part of President Trump's new South Asia policy.", "lang": "en"}
