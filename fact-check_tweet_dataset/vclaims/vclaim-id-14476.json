This message was tweeted by Suresh Chavhanke, the editor-in-chief of Sudarshan News. Tablighi Ijtemais a three day Islamic gathering that took place at Bulandshahr in Uttar Pradesh from December 1-3. On December 3, a cop was killed after a mob protesting alleged illegal cow slaughter clashed with the police in Siana tehsil of Bulandshahr district. By prefacing the tweet with \u201c\u092c\u0941\u0932\u0902\u0926\u0936\u0939\u0930_\u0907\u091c\u094d\u0924\u0947\u092e\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u092c\u0935\u093e\u0932\u201d (Unrest after Bulandshahr Ijtema \u2013 translated), Sudarshan News suggested that the Ijtema was somehow linked with the violence in which the cop was killed.\n\nChavhanke was referring to the violence that broke out in Bulandshahr on December 3 over rumours of cow slaughter. A police inspector was killed in the melee as gaurakshaks went on a rampage, targeting vehicles and state property. Chavhanke has linked the violence that took place at Bulandshahr to the Ijtema congregation. In another tweet, Chavhanke has referred to the \u2018Tablighi Jamaat\u2019 as the organiser of the Ijtema, adding that it is on the radar of security agencies.\n\nIn fact, Sudarshan News also broadcast a programme on prime time on December 2. Chavhanke in his tweet on the same day referred to the Ijtema gathering as a ruse for \u2018show of strength\u2019.\n\nBulandshahr police has clarified via twitter that the violence which shook the town is NOT related in any way to the Ijtema gathering. Replying to Chavhanke\u2019s tweet, police has appealed not to spread misinformation about the violence.\n\nIn the above tweet, Bulandshahr police has stated that the violence took place about 45-50 kilometres from the place where the Ijtema was held, adding that investigation is currently underway.\n\nIt may be noted that the Ijtema congregation was held at a locality called Dariyapur, whereas the incident of violence in which a police inspector was killed, occurred in Chingrawati village in Siyana. Using Google Maps, Alt News found that the distance between the two places is roughly 49 kilometres, which corresponds to the police\u2019s assertion that the violence took place 45-50 kilometres away from the Ijtema gathering.\n\nEarlier in July 2018, Sudarshan Newshad spread disinformation about a decree which was allegedly passed by a mosque in UP against the state police. Reporting of this nature adds fuel to the fire and vitiates inter-faith relations which are already under strain.", "lang": "en"}
