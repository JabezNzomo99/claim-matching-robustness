Dr. Charles Lieber, Head of the Department of Chemistry and Biology at Havard University, USA. USA He was arrested today according to sources from the US department.\u201d\n\nA Twitter user posted the viral video. It has over 3,000 views.\n\nIn the video, US attorney Andrew Lelling can be heard saying that the chairman of the chemistry department at Harvard University Dr Charles Lieber was arrested from his office. Liebling says that the complaint filed against Dr Lieber alleges that he signed a contract with the Chinese University in Wuhan and was paid up to $50,000 per month and up to $158,000 in living expenses. It was further reported that Dr Lieber allegedly received more than one and a half million dollars to set up a research lab in China all while working at Harvard and receiving multiple research grants from the US Department of Defense and national institutes of health.\n\nAlt News has received several requests to fact-check the video on WhatsApp (+917600011160) and on our official Android application.\n\nThe video carries a logo of US-based ABC News on the bottom right corner. Alt News performed a keyword search \u2018dr charles lieber abc news\u2019 on YouTube and found that the video was uploaded by WCVB Channel 5 Boston on January 29. The channel is affiliated with ABC News. The title of the video reads, \u201cHarvard department chair arrested; charged with concealing ties to China.\u201d\n\nNext, Alt News performed a keyword search on the official website WCVB Channel 5 Boston and found three articles that include the keywords \u2018Dr Charles Lieber\u2019.\n\nOn April 9, WCVB Channel 5 Boston published a fact-check report debunking conspiracy and false claims surrounding Lieber, China and COVID-19. Lieber was arrested on January 28 for \u201cmaking false statements to the agency of the United States Government,\u201d or lying to federal authorities about his ties to China, as per the fact-check report. The channel added that prosecutors have never alleged that Lieber was involved in manufacturing and/or selling a virus to China. The full federal court complaint against Dr Lieber can be read here.\n\nThe report also clarified Lieber\u2019s links to Wuhan. The report stated, \u201cLieber travelled to WUT (Wuhan University of Technology) in mid-November 2011 ostensibly in order to participate in a Nano-Energy Materials Forum.\u201d\n\nOn July 29, Dr Lieber\u2019s attorney Marc Mukasey told WCVB Channel 5 that he didn\u2019t hide anything or get paid as the government alleges.\n\nThus, the social media claim that Harvard professor Dr Charles Lieber \u201cmade and sold\u201d the COVID-19 virus to China is false.", "lang": "en"}
