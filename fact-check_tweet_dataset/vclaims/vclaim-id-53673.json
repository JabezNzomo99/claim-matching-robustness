The posts claim the photo shows the city's police force has distanced itself from Lam. The claim is false; the image has been doctored from a photo which has circulated in media reports since at least July 2019; the original photo showed a message purportedly written by police officers expressing opposition to Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung.\n\nThe doctored image was published here on Facebook on October 21, 2019, in a Facebook group that has more than 366,000 members.\n\nThe post has been shared more than 1,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe photo shows a Hong Kong police hat on a surface alongside six police warrant cards.\n\nThe traditional Chinese characters written on a piece of paper underneath the objects translate to English as: \u201cCarrie Lam does not represent me\u201d.\n\nCarrie Lam is the chief executive of Hong Kong.\n\nThe post\u2019s traditional Chinese language caption translates to English as: \u201cCops make a clean break\u201d.\n\nThe post was published on the same day when Lam apologised to Muslim leaders after a mosque in the Tsim Sha Tsui district was sprayed with blue dye from a police water cannon during a pro-democracy protest on October 20, 2019. Here is an AFP report about the incident.\n\nThe same photo was also published here and included here on Facebook, both carrying a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the photo has been doctored to include a message referencing Lam.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the photo included in this news article published by Hong Kong news site Hong Kong Free Press on July 26, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo in the article:\n\nThe article\u2019s headline states: \u201cHong Kong\u2019s chief sec. apologises over handling of Yuen Long attacks, stirring dissent from police\u201d.\n\nThe photo\u2019s caption states: \u201cA police cap and warrant cards placed next to the words, 'Matthew Cheung does not represent me.' Photo: supplied.\u201d\n\nThe article states in part: \u201cHong Kong\u2019s number two official Matthew Cheung has apologised for the way the government handled the Yuen Long attacks on Sunday, and for the first time described its perpetrators as \u2018thugs.\u2019\n\n\u201cHowever, his apology was denounced by some police officers, who appeared to have posted pictures distancing themselves from Cheung\u2019s remarks.\u201d\n\nMatthew Cheung is the chief secretary for administration of Hong Kong.\n\nThis article published by Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post on July 27, 2019, explains the anger triggered amongst senior police officers after Cheung's apology over the force\u2019s handling of a suspected triad attack in Yuen Long, a district in northwest Hong Kong.\n\nBelow is a comparison of the misleading image (L) and the picture posted by Hong Kong Free Press (R):\n\nThe Hong Kong Free Press article includes similar photos purportedly taken and posted online by police officers in a bid to express their anger towards Cheung.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo:\n\nThe original version of the doctored image in the misleading posts was also published by other local media organisations in Hong Kong in July 2019, including news sites hk01 here and Stand News here.\n\nBoth reports state the photo was posted online by police officers following Cheung\u2019s comments regarding the Yuen Long attacks.", "lang": "en"}
