How can the Conservatives\u2019 position be so shaky after weeks at the top?\n\nWell, the answer is that it\u2019s not quite that simple.\n\nThere are two big claims here from Mrs May. First, that the Tories would be kicked out of government if they lost just six seats. Second, that if they lost that handful of MPs, Jeremy Corbyn would walk into Downing Street on 9 June.\n\nWe\u2019re not convinced by either.\n\nWhere is the \u201csix seats\u201d figure coming from?\n\nWe asked the Tories to show us their working, but they didn\u2019t get back to us (we\u2019ll update if they do). In the absence of an explanation from them, we\u2019ve done our best to figure out how they\u2019ve arrived at this number.\n\nStart with the total number of seats the Conservatives won at the 2015 election (330). Then take the minimum number of seats a party needs to get a majority in the Commons (326). Now imagine that the Tories lose six of those 330. That would put the Conservatives on 324, two below the 326 they need.\n\nWe ran our calculations by Dr Nicholas Allen, Reader in Politics at Royal Holloway, University of London, to see if this would be a sensible way to work out Theresa May\u2019s margin of defeat. He said \u201cit\u2019s not unreasonable for the prime minister to calculate what it would take to \u2018lose\u2019 the election based on the seats won in 2015. But [the six seats figure is] technically and politically wrong\u201d.\n\nHe pointed out that if the Deputy Speakerships (which are excluded from the calculations of a government\u2019s working majority) are distributed in the same way after the election as they are today (i.e., one Tory, two Labour), Theresa May \u201ccan lose 7 seats and still command a technical if narrow majority\u201d.\n\nBut whether the figure stands at six or seven seats, it seems the Tories are promoting a pretty one-dimensional interpretation of the parliamentary arithmetic, and ignoring many of the factors that will ultimately decide this election.\n\nWe\u2019ve taken a look at what\u2019s changed in the polls in the last fortnight and how that might translate into seats in parliament \u2013 and ultimately, what it means for Mrs May\u2019s and Mr Corbyn\u2019s chances of being Prime Minister on 9 June.\n\nThere\u2019s been plenty of coverage this week charting Labour\u2019s steady climb in the polls, with one putting the Tory lead over Labour at just nine percentage points. That\u2019s the first time in this election that the figure has dipped below double-digits.\n\nBut before champagne corks start popping at Labour HQ, let\u2019s remember that the so-called \u201cpoll of polls\u201d conducted by Britain Elects, which takes an average of seven major measures of voting intention, still puts the Conservatives nearly 16 points ahead of Labour.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say Labour can\u2019t climb the mountain, but they should be under no illusions: they are still in the foothills.\n\nWhat would this look like in parliament?\n\nThanks to Mrs May\u2019s emphasis on individual leaders, it\u2019s easy to forget that this election, like every other in British history, will still be decided by whichever party, or coalition of parties, commands a majority of the 650 parliamentary seats.\n\nOur \u201cfirst-past-the-post\u201d voting system means that MPs are elected if they get the largest share of votes cast in their constituency. The effect of this is to skew national polling, which looks simply at what proportion of the total electorate intends to vote for one party or another. When we\u2019re predicting which party will be in government, it\u2019s all about distribution, distribution, distribution.\n\nFor example, in 1997, Tony Blair won a landslide of 419 parliamentary seats with only 43.2 per cent of the total votes cast nationally \u2013 giving Labour a 179-seat majority in the Commons. In that same election, the Conservatives received 30.7 per cent of the national vote, but were left with only 165 seats. The polls put them less than 12 points apart, but Labour landed 254 more seats than the Tories.\n\nSo in order to work out who will win this election, we need to consider voters\u2019 views in each of the 650 parliamentary constituencies, not just nationally.\n\nHere\u2019s where the picture gets a little less rosy for Labour.\n\nElectoral Calculus, which analyses opinion polls and \u201celectoral geography\u201d to help bridge the gap between polls and seats, puts the Conservatives on course for a 165-seat majority, and the chances of an overall majority for the Tories at 76 per cent, compared to 7 per cent for Labour.\n\nWhat are the chances of Jeremy Corbyn becoming Prime Minister?\n\nMrs May\u2019s statement suggests she wants you to think two things: 1) that the Tory lead is far from secure and 2) that Jeremy Corbyn has a real chance of becoming Prime Minister if she loses.\n\nBut if her \u201csix seats from defeat\u201d claim is to be believed, Labour would have to enter a coalition with every other party in parliament to give Jeremy Corbyn the 326 seats he\u2019d need to govern. And that doesn\u2019t look at all likely. The Lib Dems have ruled out a coalition with both Labour and the Conservatives, as have the SNP.\n\nElectoral Calculus puts the probability of Jeremy Corbyn becoming Prime Minister on 9 June \u2013 either as head of a majority government or a Labour-led coalition \u2013 at just 11 per cent. The same data says Theresa May has an 85 per cent chance of remaining Prime Minister, if we include (albeit unlikely) Conservative-led coalition scenarios.\n\nSo is Theresa May just six seats away from defeat?\n\nYes and no. On a very basic interpretation of the current state of parliament, if the Tories\u2019 share of seats falls from 330 to 324, they would no longer have a majority in the Commons (although even that ignores some of the intricacies of parliamentary arithmetic).\n\nBut more importantly, according to current polling, the chances of the Tories getting anything less than a landslide at this election are vanishingly small \u2013 let alone actually losing seats. And in the unlikely event that it did happen, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily hand victory to Corbyn, as he\u2019d need to convince every other party to enter coalition \u2013 which all sides have officially ruled out.\n\nAll the reliable data we\u2019ve seen contradicts Mrs May\u2019s suggestion that this election is on a knife edge.\n\nMany are speculating on why she might want to give that impression. Her post majors heavily on what she apparently considers the calamitous prospect of Jeremy Corbyn becoming Prime Minister, \u201csitting down to negotiate with the presidents, prime ministers and chancellors of Europe\u201d.\n\nWe asked Dr Allen for his take. He said: \u201cMay is probably trying to dampen down expectations of an enormous Tory landslide [\u2026] She needs to motivate activists. She needs to mobilise Tory voters, who might otherwise stay at home thinking it\u2019s a dead cert. And she needs to manage her colleagues\u2019 expectations. It\u2019s always better to be seen to exceed expectations than under-perform\u201d.\n\nThat may be the case, but it\u2019s a gamble too, if it gives wavering Labour voters the impression that a Corbyn win is feasible. John Cleese\u2019s party political broadcast for the Lib Dems in 1997 pointed out the tendency for people to avoid voting for a party if they think it\u2019s got no chance of winning. If they think it\u2019s in with a shot, enough voters could head to the polls to make victory possible.\n\nLabour\u2019s fortunes in this election have looked so bleak thus far that Theresa May might be worried that Tory voters will get complacent. Making a Corbyn premiership seem a realistic possibility could be one way to get out her vote.\n\nEither way, we\u2019re we\u2019re not convinced that the election is anywhere near as close as she\u2019d like you to think.", "lang": "en"}
