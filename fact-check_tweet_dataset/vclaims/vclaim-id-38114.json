The quote attributed to him in the Facebook post appears to fall in the latter category. (RELATED: Did Einstein Say, \u2018Certain People Appear Bright Until You Hear Them Speak\u2019?)\n\nA search for the expression in the Einstein Archives Online, which contains around 80,000 documents related to the theoretical physicist, turned up no matches. It appears in the \u201cProbably Not By Einstein\u201d section of Alice Calaprice\u2019s \u201cThe Ultimate Quotable Einstein,\u201d a preeminent text on sayings from Einstein.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation reached out to several experts, none of whom could find the saying in his writings.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no source for this one, and so it\u2019s probably not by Einstein,\u201d said Andrew Robinson, author of \u201cEinstein: A Hundred Years of Relativity,\u201d in an email to the DCNF.\n\nA precursor to the expression appeared in a late 19th century French encyclopedic dictionary, according to the website Quote Investigator. The work, entitled \u201cGreat Universal Dictionary of the Nineteenth Century\u201d in English, includes a saying attributed to writer Alexandre Dumas fils under the entry \u201cStupidity.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thing that humbles me deeply is to see that human genius has its limits while human stupidity does not,\u201d it reads.\n\nVariations of the saying have been attributed to Einstein since at least 1994, according to Quote Investigator.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
