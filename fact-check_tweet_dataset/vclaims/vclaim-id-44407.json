The original text can be found at the bottom of this article:\n\nI\u2019m a liberal, but that doesn\u2019t mean what a lot of you apparently think it does. Let\u2019s break it down, shall we? Because quite frankly, I\u2019m getting a little tired of being told what I believe and what I stand for. Spoiler alert: not every liberal is the same, though the majority of liberals I know think along roughly these same lines: 1. I believe a country should take care of its weakest members. A country cannot call itself civilized when its children, disabled, sick, and elderly are neglected. PERIOD.\n\nWhile several postings of this text attributed the essay to Howard, this article circulated on social media long before his name was attached to it.\n\nThe article was actually written by author Lori Gallagher Witt and was posted to her Facebook page in January 2018. As this article spread on social media, Witt\u2019s name was eventually stripped from the text. When the article appeared on the website Medium in August 2019, for instance, it was preceded by an introduction explaining that a \u201cfriend\u201d had posted the article from an anonymous author on Facebook:\n\nWitt has commented on how her work was separated from her name. In July 2019, she noted how one website was sharing her text without proper attribution:\n\nHe posts my words, doesn\u2019t even mention that they\u2019re written by someone else (though after someone told him I wrote it, there was a line added at the very bottom as an afterthought, while still keeping HIS NAME as the byline). In the comments, he responds to compliments by saying this is him making a stand, AND he uses the post to encourage people to follow him on social media.\n\nIn January 2020, she lamented that her work was once again spreading on social media without her name attached to it:\n\nIn short, the popular internet essay starting \u201cI\u2019m a liberal, I\u2019ve always been a liberal, but that doesn\u2019t mean what a lot of you apparently think it does\u201d was not written by director Ron Howard but by author Lori Gallagher Witt.", "lang": "en"}
