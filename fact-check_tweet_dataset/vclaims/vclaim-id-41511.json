In 2017, Osteen came under fire after he initially did not open his 16,800-seat facility to serve as a shelter for Hurricane Harvey victims.\n\nNow, a screenshot is circulating on social media of what appears to be a woman asking for prayers for her marriage on the Facebook page of Joel Osteen\u2019s Ministries, only to be told that she needs to purchase a \"prayer request account.\"\n\nThe screenshot shows a woman writing on the (supposed) Joel Osteen\u2019s Ministries page: \"I am requesting prayer for my marriage,\" and then displays the following response from the page:\n\n\"Unfortunately, your Joel Osteen prayer request account has not been activated. In order to activate your account, you will need to add a monthly donation of $24.99, which will give you access to 3 prayer requests per month. If you donate $49.99 each month you will become a Platinum Prayer Request member, which gives you access to over 10 prayer requests per month and a chance to buy tickets to my next performance at your local arena.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
