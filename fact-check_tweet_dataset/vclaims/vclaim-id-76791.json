It's also important to remember the pool of refugees we're talking about is about 1,400 people.\n\nTrump\u2019s data comes from information maintained by the State Department\u2019s Refugee Processing Center. The center has an interactive tool that allows the data on admissions to be sifted by country and date.\n\nFrom Feb. 3 to Feb. 11, the percentage of refugees arriving from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen was about 72 percent or 1,049 out of 1,462. (Judge James L. Robart of Federal District Court in Seattle blocked the order on Feb. 3, a decision upheld on appeal.)\n\nThe majority of refugee admissions were from Syria and Iraq, followed by Somalia and Iran and then 37 Sudanese refugees. No refugees were recorded from Libya and Yemen.\n\nThe makeup of refugees entering the United States looked a little different after Trump\u2019s first day as president Jan. 20. Basically, there were more refugees arriving from other countries.\n\nIn the week before his Jan. 27 order, the United States processed 2,108 refugees. The percentage of refugees from the seven countries in the order was lower, but 44 percent (as opposed to 72 percent) were were from those seven countries.\n\nThe number of refugees entering the United States from the seven countries targeted in the order has steadily increased since Feb. 3, while the refugee arrivals from countries not affected by the order has fallen, according to data from the Refugee Processing Center.\n\nOn Feb. 11, Trump tweeted \"Our legal system is broken!\" and cited a report in the Washington Times showing that 77 percent of the refugees who entered the United States since had been from the seven \"suspect countries.\"\n\nTrump said that 72 percent of the refugees admitted into United States between Feb. 3 and Feb. 11 were from seven countries his executive order targets.\n\nAccording to the Refugee Processing Center, of the 1,462 refugees entering the United States between that time frame, roughly 72 percent were from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Syria and Sudan. No refugees were from Libya and Yemen.", "lang": "en"}
