The spokesperson said:\n\nThe \u20b92000 banknote was first introduced after demonetisation on November 8, 2016. The RBI has revealed data on these notes pertaining to:\n\u2022 The \u20b92000 note's share in the volume of all banknotes in circulation\n\u2022 The \u20b92000 notes' share in the value of all banknotes in circulation\n\nThe data has been released for end-March; 2017, 2018 and 2019, in the RBI's annual reports.\n\nThe RBI's annual report for 2019, has shown that while the \u20b92000 note's share in volume is 3%, its share in the circulation value is 31.2%. These values have actually fallen from their 2017 shares, which stood at 3% and 50.2% respectively. \n\n\n\nThe message blends well into the year-on-year declining trend in the share of the \u20b92000 banknote.\n\nEven though the share of the \u20b92000 note in volume and in value of total circulation may be falling, there is no indication of its withdrawal by the RBI - as reinforced earlier in the story - or by the Government of India.\n\nSince the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank (PMC Bank) issue started first on September 24, BOOM has debunked several stories around the banking system in India.\n\nThis story is the latest that BOOM has debunked in among these stories around banks.
