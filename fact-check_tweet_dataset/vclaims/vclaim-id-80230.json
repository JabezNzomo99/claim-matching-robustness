The government body said no complaint had been filed and the Supreme Court has not released any such order.\n\nThe Sabiniya website claims the Supreme Court issued a two-page memo ordering Kris Aquino to return the necklace following a complaint from the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG).\n\nIt said that Aquino wore the necklace to the 2015 Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO Summit in Manila.\n\nThe PCGG was created in 1987 after a popular revolt led by Kris Aquino\u2019s mother, Corazon \"Cory\" Aquino, ended the 20-year rule of Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nIt was tasked with recovering the ill-gotten wealth of the late dictator and his wife, Imelda.\n\nThe PCGG\u2019s spokesman told AFP it did not file any complaint against Aquino regarding the necklace and that its collection of Marcos jewellery was all accounted for.\n\n\u201cNo complaint was filed against Kris Aquino,\u201d the spokesman, John Jao, told AFP.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Marcos jewellery collection stored at the vault of the Central Bank of the Philippines were all accounted for based on the original list made following its seizure in 1986.\u201d\n\nThe Sabiniya article, dated Tuesday February 6, said the Supreme Court released its memo on Monday.\n\nThere are no public records of the Supreme Court releasing any such memo. Its decisions are available online.\n\nThe Supreme Court also has a Twitter account in which it regularly posts updates on its activities. There is no record of any memo on that account.\n\nAquino also posted on her official Instagram account in October 2016 that she bought the necklace and said it was of cubic zirconia and silver, not diamonds.\n\nBenigno Aquino stepped down as president at the end of his six-year term in mid-2016, when he was replaced by Rodrigo Duterte.\n\nThe article has been shared through Facebook groups with combined followers of more than 700,000 people, according to data from social media monitoring tool Crowdtangle.\n\nMost of these Facebook groups support Duterte and the Marcos family.", "lang": "en"}
