Australian officials then alerted their American counterparts.\n\nThe information provided by Mr. Steele did not reach the F.B.I. officials charged with investigating Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign until mid-September, The Times reported last week.\n\nRepublicans who hold the majority vote on the House Intelligence Committee have also stated that the investigation was opened because of information linked to Mr. Papadopoulos \u2014 not Mr. Steele\u2019s dossier.", "lang": "en"}
