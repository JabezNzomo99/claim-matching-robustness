Chances are you\u2019ll end up working for one.\u201d\n\nDespite being widely attributed to Gates, the expression actually originated with political commentator Charles J. Sykes.\n\nGates, a billionaire with an estimated $96.5 billion net worth in 2019, cofounded software firm Microsoft in 1975. He and his wife Melinda chair the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the world\u2019s largest private charitable organization, according to Forbes.\n\nAlthough the quote attributed to Gates in the Facebook post has been linked to him since at least 2010, there is no evidence that it originated with Gates. An internet search reveals no credible sources ascribing it to him.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation search his books \u2013 \u201cThe Road Ahead\u201d and \u201cBussiness @ the Speed of Thought\u201d \u2013 but found no record of the expression in either.\n\nThe statement, which often appears in a list called \u201cRules Kids Won\u2019t Learn In School\u201d that also gets attributed to Gates online, actually comes from Sykes, a political commentator. In his book \u201c50 Rules Kids Won\u2019t Learn in School,\u201d Sykes writes, \u201cBe nice to nerds. You may end up working for them. We all could.\u201d\n\nSykes confirmed in a Twitter direct message to the DCNF that the quote originated with him, not Gates.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
