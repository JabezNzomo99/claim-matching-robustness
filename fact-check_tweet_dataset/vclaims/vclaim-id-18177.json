So he\u2019s just not telling the truth about the polls.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt no point this year have the polls ever shown a consistent Labour lead\u201d according to polling expert Anthony Wells from YouGov.\n\nThat\u2019s the problem with the claim: you need more than a poll or two to know that you\u2019re winning in the polls, whatever party you\u2019re from.\n\nPolls are uncertain and have a margin of error, which means if one party is apparently only slightly ahead of another, you can\u2019t tell it\u2019s actually in the lead from a single poll. You need a series of polls to show a consistent lead in order to be surer.\n\nOnly three have shown Labour ahead of the Conservatives at certain points in the last year, according to Anthony Well\u2019s list of polls. One shortly after the referendum showed the two parties were neck and neck. Each time this has happened, most polls around the same time showed the Conservatives ahead.\n\nLabour did win about half of the local council seats up for election earlier this year, a similar proportion to the previous comparable elections in 2012. It lost a small number of seats overall, though the Conservatives lost more.\n\nWe updated the article to make it clearer, including the claim and conclusion.", "lang": "en"}
