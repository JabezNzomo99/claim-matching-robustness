The president is also referring to the rate of gun deaths, not an absolute total (as the biggest states are almost always going to have the most number of gun deaths).\n\nBut this is also an issue about scope. Most gun deaths \u2014 more than 60 percent in 2013 \u2014 are actually suicides. The president made his remarks in the aftermath of the tragic shooting rampage at an Oregon community college, and so it\u2019s a judgment call as to whether counting suicides is appropriate. After all, Obama wants to thwart mass shootings by enacting universal background checks aimed at people with criminal histories.\n\nSome might argue that it is wrong to exclude suicides from the data, as less access to guns might result in fewer suicides. The data on that is mixed. Gun-related suicides might decline, but studies have shown little connection between suicides and access to guns. A 2004 report published by the National Academy of Sciences concluded that \u201csome gun control policies may reduce the number of gun suicides, but they have not yet been shown to reduce the overall risk of suicide in any population.\u201d\n\nThe data used in this chart calculates the the number of gun-related deaths per 100,000 people by including all gun deaths, including homicides, suicides, accidental gun deaths and legal intervention involving firearms. The states at the top of the chart \u2014 Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and New Jersey \u2014 are listed as having tough restrictions, based on seven kinds of criteria. The states at the bottom \u2014 Alaska, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas and Wyoming \u2014 have virtually none of these restrictions.\n\nGun rights advocates have disputed some of National Journal\u2019s criteria as arbitrary and haphazard. John R. Lott Jr., a gun rights analyst, noted that California, Illinois and Washington are coded by National Journal as states without \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws \u2014 which permit the use of deadly force in self-defense in public. A footnote says that court decisions in those states have in effect permitted \u201cstand your ground\u201d actions with no requirement to retreat. Lott asks: \u201cWho cares whether you have \u2018stand your ground\u2019 provisions because of a law or court precedents?\u201d\n\nIn any case, we were curious to see what would happen if suicides were removed from the totals. After all, rural areas (which may have less-restrictive gun laws) have a lot of suicides of older single men who become lonely. So we ran the numbers \u2014 and in some cases, it made a huge difference.\n\nHere\u2019s a chart showing the results of our research. We highlighted the 25 states deemed to have the least-restrictive gun laws, based on criteria from a 2013 paper looking at gun-death data between 2007 and 2010 assembled by a team headed by Eric W. Fleegler, a pediatric emergency medicine physician at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. (The paper\u2019s criteria, which assigned each state a score based on gun purchasing and ownership requirements during the period studied, is also disputed by gun rights advocates such as Lott, but this seemed the easiest way to distinguish the states.)\n\nFleegler, however, argues that the results, as shown in his paper, still support the case that more gun laws result in lower death rates. He likened the results to an antibiotic that would work for 80 percent of the people who take it. \u201cSome people do not have the same response, just as not every states has the same response to gun laws,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cStates such as Hawaii have had low firearm homicide rates as far back as we have data, long before they have the gun laws that are on the books,\u201d Lott said. \u201cThe issue here should really be whether gun control laws caused crime rates to fall relative to other states after they have been implemented.\u201d He says his own research suggests there is little difference.\n\nObama first stated his claim as a fact \u2014 \u201cwe know\u201d \u2014 but mitigated it with \u201ctend to have.\u201d But then he followed up the statement with a very definite claim: \u201cSo the notion that gun laws don\u2019t work, or just will make it harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns is not borne out by the evidence.\u201d\n\nThis is a classic situation in which a politician bases a statement on a study, but then exaggerated the conclusions to justify a policy. It also lacks context because the results change, sometimes dramatically, when suicides are removed from the gun deaths. (Alaska moving from 50th to 25th, Utah going from 31st to 8th and Maryland falling from 15th to 45th are rather dramatic swings.)\n\nMoreover, the counting of gun laws is certainly open to interpretation, so that also affects the outcome. It\u2019s not enough to count laws to figure out the reasons why gun deaths are lower in one state than another. One would need to specifically determine whether certain laws had an effect, over time, on the gun-death rate in a state.\n\nWe wavered between Two and Three Pinocchios, but in the end settled on Two. Most of the states at the bottom appear to have less-restrictive gun laws even when calculated without suicides. So that\u2019s an interesting data point. But the evidence is not as clear cut as the president claims.", "lang": "en"}
