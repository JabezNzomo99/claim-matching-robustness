The Aug. 29 caption reads, \u201cBikers all over South Africa, are riding together today against farm murders and Racism.\u201d\n\nFrom April 2019 to March 2020, 49 people were murdered on South African farms and small holdings, according to data from the South African Police Service. There were over 21,300 murders in South Africa during that time period, the data shows.

A reverse image search revealed the photo was taken days before at an event in Lithuania.\n\nNexta, a Belarusian website that uses a Telegram channel, tweeted a watermarked version of the photo on Aug. 23. with the caption: \u201cBeautiful scenes from Lithuania today where 50 thousand people formed a solidarity chain from Vilnius to the Belarusian border.\u201d At least one Lithuanian flag is visible in the photo.\n\nTens of thousands of people in Lithuania linked arms on Aug. 23 to show solidarity for demonstrators protesting against the results of the disputed Aug. 9 presidential election in Belarus, according to Fox News. Other photos from the human chain can be viewed on Getty Images.\n\nThe display resembles a similar event that took place in August 1989, when over a million people from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania linked arms to protest against Soviet occupation, the New York Post reported.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
