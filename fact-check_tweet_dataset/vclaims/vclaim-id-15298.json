[1]\n\nMs O\u2019Toole holds Herbert by just 37 votes and a margin of 0.02 per cent, making it the most marginal electorate in Australia. [2]\n\nHerbert takes in the city of Townsville and predominantly its northern surrounds plus Magnetic and Palm Islands. [3] It has 104,815 enrolled voters and a population of 189,429. [4] [5]\n\nAccording to Population Australia 2019 figures, the main employment industry is public administration and safety, accounting for 19.7 per cent of jobs. Only 3.5 per cent of jobs are engaged in mining. [4]\n\nAs a result, unemployment and especially youth unemployment in Herbert is a major issue in the 2019 federal election campaign. [2]\n\nAccording to 2019 Australian Bureau of Statistics, Australia\u2019s national unemployment average is 5.0 per cent. [6]\n\nAccording to the federal Department of Jobs and Small Business Labour Market Information from February 2019, Townsville\u2019s unemployment average is 8.0 per cent. [7]\n\nBased on these figures, AAP FactCheck found Ms O\u2019Toole\u2019s first claim that her area had \u201calmost double\u201d the national unemployment average to be false. The true figure is 1.6 times the national rate of unemployment.\n\nRegarding youth unemployment, Queensland government Statistician\u2019s Office data shows the Townsville region\u2019s youth unemployment was 17.3 per cent in December 2018. [8]\n\nBased on this data AAP FactCheck found Ms O\u2019Toole\u2019s second claim that the area had a youth unemployment rate \u201cabove\u201d 17 per cent to be true.\n\nYoung unemployed people in Australia are generally classified as being aged from 15-24 years. [9]\n\nABS data shows there were 30,545 Townsville citizens aged between 15-24 in 2017. [10]\n\nOf this 15-24 age group, 17.3 per cent are unemployed according to Queensland government Statistician\u2019s Office data. That is equivalent to 5284 people, which is close to Ms O\u2019Toole\u2019s claim of one in five out of work. The true figure is one in 5.78 people out of work.\n\nAAP FactCheck found Ms O\u2019Toole\u2019s third claim that one in five Townsville young people are without work to be mostly true.\n\nAAP FactCheck concludes Ms O\u2019Toole\u2019s three claims to be \u201csomewhat true\u201d overall. Her first claim the area had \u201calmost double\u201d the national unemployment average was false. Her second claim her area had a youth unemployment rate \u201cabove\u201d 17 per cent was true. Her third claim that Townsville had one in five jobless is also true.", "lang": "en"}
