Two days later, he asked the Duma to take contradictory action. Putin\u2019s visit to the Russian military base Khmeimim followed Russia\u2019s announcement of \u201cvictory\u201d over the Islamic State in Syria.\n\nTwo days after his order, Putin requested from the nation\u2019s Parliament approval for a significant expansion of Russia\u2019s military presence in Syria, namely in the Naval base in Tartus.\n\nThe agreement between the governments of Russia and Syria would allow the Russian Naval presence to continue for 49 years, \u201cautomatically renewed\u201d every 25 years. It allows eleven Russian Navy vessels, including nuclear \u2013powered vessels to be based at Tartus.\n\n\u201cRussia will continue to maintain a significant military presence in Syria, despite the announcement,\u201d said Matti Suomenaro, an analyst for the Institute for the Study of War in Washington, DC, referring to Putin\u2019s withdrawal announcement. \u201cRussia regularly uses these partial withdrawals to rotate out redundant capabilities while bringing in units better suited for the next phase of Russian operations in Syria. The announcement nonetheless also serves to help bolster Putin\u2019s image domestically in Russia ahead of the upcoming Presidential elections scheduled for March 2018.\u201d\n\nSome of the Russian media reported on Putin\u2019s order with a sense of pride, highlighting an ongoing Kremlin narrative that Russia was invited to Syria by the Assad regime purportedly to fight terrorists.\n\n\u201cI feel somewhat ashamed [for the Americans] to even comment. We know who won. The world knows who brought the victory. And when somebody wants to cling to someone else's glory \u2013 that is also obvious,\u201d Valentina Matvienko, Putin\u2019s close ally and the Speaker of Russia\u2019s Council of Federation \u2013 the upper House of the Parliament said on Wednesday, December 13, 2017 commenting on the U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of the defeat of Islamic State.\n\nMatvienko also revealed what she said was \u201ca state secret.\u201d\n\n\u201cPutin personally took command over Russian military operation in Syria. This is his personal victory and his great personal achievement,\u201d she said, adding that \u201ceven rivals had to admit Putin\u2019s Middle East visit as triumphant.\u201d\n\nAmong the recent claims Polygraph.info reviewed: \u2013 that the United States and the coalition have indiscriminately targeted civilians, blocked humanitarian aid to a key refugee camp, protected terrorists from Russian troops, and, in a violation of international law , refused to leave despite the fact that there are no terrorists anymore in Syria because IS\u2019s destroyed by Russia, these and others were \u200bdebunked.\n\nRegarding the Naval base, Vyacheslav Volodin, the chairman of the Parliament [State Duma] announced less than an hour after Putin\u2019s request that the President\u2019s proposal will be approved \u201cbefore the end of 2017.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of the Parliament\u2019s Committee of Foreign Affairs Leonid Slutsky announced his Committee\u2019s unconditional support of the proposed legislation and recommended its approval.", "lang": "en"}
