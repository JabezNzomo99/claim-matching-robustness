The message posted along with the video suggests that social media users should see this on-ground news report after the Balakot air strike in Pakistan to comprehend the reality. In the video, some people can be seen carrying the corpses of those who apparently died in the attack. The post, which has now been deleted, had garnered more than 10,000 shares and close to 9 lakh views.\n\nOne Megha Osheen also tweeted the video with the claim that Pakistani journalists are giving us the evidence of the air strike. It has racked up close to 1300 retweets so far.\n\nAnother Facebook page, 4K Viral Hindustanhas also shared the video with the identical text.\n\nIn the comments section of Facebook posts and as responses to the Twitter post, several people expressed their doubts regarding the veracity of the video.\n\nAlt News found that the video attempts to portray a Pakistani news channel trying to cover-up the deaths due to the IAF air strike. When we looked at the video frame-by-frame, in one particular frame, we found that the text inscribed on the microphone, held by the reporter reads, \u201c\u0932\u093e\u0908\u091f \u091f\u0940\u0935\u0940 (Light TV)\u201c. It is highly improbable that a Pakistani news channel\u2019s mic would have a logo written in Hindi. Moreover, the behaviour of the duo shown as reporters in the video is atypical to reporters covering such a serious incident, involving multiple casualties.\n\nEven though the attempt is to portray a Pakistani channel,the language spoken in the video doesn\u2019t even remotely sound like Urdu. For instance, the reporter says, \u201ckhuda ki daya se\u201d, whereas a person with a basic fluency in Urdu would prefer to say, \u201ckhuda ke karam se\u201d. Also, the duo in the video use Hindi words like \u2018jyada\u2019, and \u2018 nivedan\u2019. Had the correspondents been based in Pakistan, their most common choice of words would have been, \u2018zyada\u2019, and, \u2018guzaarish\u2018.\n\nIn conclusion, an staged news report of the Balakot air strike was believed to be a ground report from the bombed site in Pakistan.", "lang": "en"}
