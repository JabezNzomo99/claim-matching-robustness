As mentioned in the sections below, many authorities have given reference to the undersupply of employment data.\n\nBOOM looks at multiple data sources to ascertain the validity of Gandhi's statement.\n\nIn India, the government cites data to showcase job creation from the Employee Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), and these have often been bought up in the course of political discourse.\n\nHere tweet that reflect this:\n\nEven Finance Minister of India, Piyush Goyal, cited EPFO data in the recent Interim Budget that was presented in Parliament on February 1.\n\nThe EPFO data provides figures on the number of new Provident Funds created in the organised/formal sector, and is used as a proxy to gauge new jobs created.\n\nThis proxy has been established due to a lack of comprehensive data on jobs, as stated in an article stated by Rajya Sabha TV (the television and media mouthpiece of India's Upper House of Parliament), an archived version which can be read here. This brief article states the lines:\n\nThe payroll data showed, in total, as many as 61.8 lakh jobs were created during September 2017 to July 2018 period. Amid concerns over jobless growth and lack of comprehensive data on jobs, the government started releasing data on job creations in the formal sector since September 2017. Any company employing more than 20 people gets covered by EPFO.\n\nAs per their data, which is on the website of the Ministry of Labour and Employment and can found here:\n\nHowever, EPFO data may not be the best mirror to gauge job creation, as covered by newspapers here and here.\n\nAmongst points stated in these articles are:\n\u2022 EPFO data could be used as a better indicator of the formalisation of employment than job creation.\n\u2022 EPFO data does not provide clarity on its approach to double-counting.\n\u2022 As per statutory regulation, a PFO is required to be provided by firms with more than 20 employees. Even if a firm employees 19 personnel and adds another to make it 20, EPFO data would show that 20 new jobs have been created, when the new job created is only one.\n\nAssuming EPFO data as the perfect proxy figure to job creation, Gandhi seems to have underestimate job data figures, pegging it at only 450 per day.\n\nMcKinsey Research released a discussion paper in June 2017 on the growth of meaningful jobs in India, which can be accessed here.\n\nThe reports, while highlighting job growth between 2011 to 2015, states:\n\nSurveys showing a three-percentage-point decline in India\u2019s overall labour force participation between 2011 and 2015 should not take focus away from the structural shift from agriculture towards the non-farm sector, particularly construction, trade, and transport. During this period, agriculture shrank by 26 million while non-farm jobs rose by 33 million, largely driven by rapid economic growth between 2013 and 2015.\n\nThis report cites the annual surveys of the Ministry of Labour, and states:\n\nSeven million or seventy lakh (7,000,000) jobs in 5 years translates to:\n\u2022 Which further translates to an average of 3836 jobs a day\n\nThe report further echoes the claims of an employment data deficit and states:\n\nWhile the numbers from the annual report of the Ministry of Labour has been the covered above, the annual employment-unemployment survey does provide these figures according to three labour-related metrics in India:\n\nThe report can be accessed here.\n\u2022 The Annual Economic Survey, that is presented just before the budget. The latest version is the one presented for 2017-2018 (since only the interim budget has been presented in 2019), which can be accessed here. However, it does not give any mention of the jobs created, but only of the statistical status quo across various parameters. Plus, it provides numbers only up to 2012.\n\u2022 Mahesh Vyas of The Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy states a job creation of 1.5 million in fiscal 2017. This averages to 4110 jobs per day, as reported here.\n\u2022 A recent press statement by the NITI Aayog, who stated that 7 million to 7.7 million jobs were being created yearly - which translates to 19,000 - 21,000 daily jobs, in the same vicinity as the EPFO table shared above. The press conference has been covered in the last paragraphs here.\n\u2022 The leaked NSSO survey by Business Standard; while shedding light on the high unemployment rate - at a 45-year high - states no absolute figures (in the public domain) for the number of jobs generated in any given timeframe.", "lang": "en"}
