It is being claimed that people from a specific community are protesting in Bengal.\n\nThis is Bengal . Muslims says we will take over everything. Thanks to Secularism.\u201d\n\nAnother such post can be seen here.\n\nThe same video was posted by Pakistani-Canadian author Tarek Fatah on his official Twitter handle with the same claim. Later it was taken down.\n\nALSO READ: Don\u2019t fall for this statement falsely attributed to President\u2026\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above post and found it to be misleading.\n\nFirstly, on closely analysing the video we noticed the national flag of Bangladesh at 00:39 seconds time counter, which raised the first red flag.\n\nWe also noticed banners about Rohingya Muslims. According to the posters, the protest march was organised by \u2018Islami Shasantantra Chhatra Andolan\u2019 which is one of the biggest Islamist political party in Bangladesh.\n\nMoreover, the Kolkata Police clarified on their official Twitter handle that the video in question is from Bangladesh marking Tarek Fatah\u2019s tweet as FAKE.\n\nMeanwhile, Fatah acknowledged his mistake and apologised on Twitter.\n\nHence, in conclusion, the above information proves that the video in question is NOT from Bengal and the claim attched with the post is false.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
