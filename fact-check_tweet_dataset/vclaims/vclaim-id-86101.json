But the numbers don't really add up.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-07-27T07:00:51Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-86101", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/07/27/have-u-s-taxpayers-spent-72-million-on-trumps-golf-outings/", "vclaim": "But our eyebrows went up when we saw this tweet by a liberal-leaning veterans group \u2014 retweeted or liked by more than 50,000 people \u2014 because it offered such a precise number, to the dollar: $72,181,957. We often warn readers about false precision and decided to examine how this was calculated.\n\nWhile VoteVets says Trump has spent \u201c123 days golfing,\u201d the website says that there are only 59 days when Trump was confirmed to have golfed, as the White House is generally secretive about whether the president has golfed while visiting one of his golf-club properties. Using data compiled by our colleague Philip Bump, she calculates that Trump has likely golfed on 110 days. That\u2019s a lot closer to 123, but it\u2019s still short.\n\nAbout $45 million of the $72 million total comes from an estimate of the cost of Air Force One flights to Mar-a-Lago in Florida and Bedminster, N.J. Germain\u2019s numbers appear based on about four hours of flying back and forth to Florida and 1.5 hours back and forth to New Jersey, at a cost of $518,000 an hour.\n\nGermain cites another Bump article for this $518,000 figure, but that came from what Bump called \u201ca very loose estimate\u201d early in the administration, based on travel by Obama, and it turned out to be too high. (The author of a Government Accountability Office report on Obama\u2019s travel later told the AP that the figures in that report could not be used to calculate the cost of Trump\u2019s travel because Obama included a stop that required additional support equipment.) The GAO report indicated there was a cost for support aircraft to accompany any president, but that figure is unknown in Trump\u2019s case.\n\nThe Air Force, in a letter to Judicial Watch in May 2017 about a round of golf that Trump played at Mar-a-Lago with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, said that the cost per hour of flying Air Force One in fiscal year 2017 was $142,380. (That was a reduction from $206,337 in fiscal year 2015.) With total flying of slightly more than four hours, that added up to about $600,000 for that particular trip.\n\nUpdate, Feb. 5, 2019: The Government Accountability Office released a report looking only at Trump\u2019s first four trips to Mar-a-Lago as president: on Feb. 3-6; Feb. 10-12; Feb. 17-20; and March 3-5, 2017. It concluded the total cost was just under $14 million, for an average cost of $3.4 million per trip. Given that Trump has made 19 trips, Bump concluded the government has spent more than $64 million on Trump\u2019s trips to the resort. Just looking at flying, the cost would be about $40 million \u2014 close to what Germain calculated.]\n\nThe website also includes $16 million for the expense of guarding the coast off Mar-a-Lago, also extrapolated from a 2017 Washington Post report, as well as security costs to local governments that are reimbursed by the federal governments. More recently, Germain added numbers from newspaper accounts for Trump\u2019s trip to his property in Turnberry, Scotland, such as an estimated $1.3 million of the cost of luxury car rental. But that\u2019s pretty standard for a presidential trip overseas.\n\nA note on the website says that an error in calculation led Germain to cut the number in half in late 2017, from $92 million to $42 million, because she wrongly assumed the local reimbursements were only for golf-related costs, when in fact much was for Trump Tower when Melania Trump stays there. Her error indicates just how flimsy such estimates are and why citing a precise dollar figure can be so misleading.\n\nOne can also broadly question whether it is fair to attribute all of the costs of presidential travel and support to a round of golf. Much of the logistical support for a president must follow him wherever he goes, so if the president has one four-hour round of golf in a 24-hour day, is it fair to attribute all of those daily security and logistical costs to that round of golf? We would say no.\n\nThe figures in this tweet are a great example of false precision. We do not know exactly how many days Trump has golfed, and we do not know how much has been paid by taxpayers for his golf outings.\n\nThe website cited by VoteVets combines estimates and extrapolations from newspaper reporting and yet suggests the actual figure as known down to the dollar. That\u2019s pretty misleading, especially because the hourly cost of flying the president to his properties appears much too high. Unless actual, confirmed data is available, estimates should never be presented as actual dollar figures.\n\nUpdate: After this fact check was published, Germain wrote The Fact Checker to thank us for the \u201cexcellent article,\u201d which she said \u201cmake really great points.\u201d She said she would examine more closely the figures used for air travel and would immediately begin using a rounded figure on the website, not a precise dollar amount.\n\nUpdate, Feb. 5, 2019: In light of the more precise numbers from GAO, we are dropping the Pinocchio rating to One Pinocchio. (Originally, it was Three Pinocchios.) It turns out Germain was in the ballpark with her estimates though she should not have have used such precise numbers \u2014 a problem that has now been corrected. But one cannot fairly attribute all of these costs to golf, given the round-the-clock security required for a president.", "lang": "en"}
