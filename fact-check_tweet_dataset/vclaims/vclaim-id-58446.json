The posts add Thailand has the \"lowest number of infected cases at present\". The claims, however, are misleading; the index cited in the posts, the Global Health Security (GHS) Index, was published months before the COVID-19 pandemic; Thailand also does not have the lowest number of COVID-19 infections in Asia or worldwide, according to multiple international authorities.\n\nThe claim was published on Facebook here on May 8, 2020. It has been shared more than 21,000 times.\n\nThe post's Thai-language caption translates to English in part as: \u201cThailand is the only developing country which is in the top ten list of the GHS Index by ranking as number 6 in the world and number 1 in Asia, meaning that Thailand has ranked no. 1 in the COVID-19 fight category, possessing the crown for the world champion in terms of pandemic prevention and has the lowest number of infected cases at present.\u201d\n\nA similar claim about Thailand\u2019s ranking was also shared on Facebook here, here, here, and here.\n\nBut the claim is misleading.\n\nThe Global Health Security Index was published in October 2019, months before the outbreak of COVID-19. The report describes itself as \u201cthe first comprehensive assessment and benchmarking of health security and related capabilities across the 195 countries\u201d.\n\nIn the report, Thailand is the highest ranking Asian country and the 6th most prepared country worldwide for an infectious disease outbreak. The GHS, however, has not been updated to reflect the COVID-19 pandemic and does not rank countries in any \u201cCOVID-19 fight category,\u201d as claimed in the misleading posts.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the report\u2019s pre-COVID-19 ranking categories:\n\nThe misleading posts\u2019 claim that Thailand has \u201cthe lowest number of infected cases\u201d is also false, both in Asia and worldwide.\n\nAs of May 15, 2020, Thailand has 3,018 confirmed cases on COVID-19, according to World Health Organization figures. Several regional countries -- including Cambodia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Nepal and Sri Lanka -- all have lower levels of confirmed infections to date.\n\nWHO Thailand specialist Dr. Richard Brown told AFP by email on May 15, 2020 that \u201cit is incorrect to say that Thailand has the lowest number of cases of COVID-19 globally\u201d.\n\n\u201cThailand has a total of 3017 cumulative cases confirmed to date and 56 deaths as of 12 May 2020. Looking at other countries in the region, where number of cases are lower than Thailand, Vietnam for instance has 288 confirmed cases and zero deaths. In Myanmar there have been 180 confirmed cases and six deaths.\u201d\n\nThe same findings are reflected in figures published by US-based John Hopkins University researchers.", "lang": "en"}
