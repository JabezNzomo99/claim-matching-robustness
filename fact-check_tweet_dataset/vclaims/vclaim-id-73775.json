No, that's not true: The quote originated from a parody Twitter account that poses as the former White House press secretary.\n\nThe quote appeared in a Facebook post (archived here) published on August 6, 2020. The poster used a photo of the fake quote tweet written on a dry erase board. The board read:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nThe quote appeared on May 13, 2020, in a tweet posted by the @hucklebee_sarah Twitter account. Note that it misspells her name as \"Hucklebee\" and the user bio reads in part, \"I'm not who you think I am.\"\n\nThe fke quote took on a life beyond the fake tweet, including in a letter to the editor of the Sumter, S.C., Item, in which the writer using the quote to support an argument against a local mask ordinance apparently was unaware it was not real.\n\nSanders' real account runs under the username, @SarahHuckabee. Sanders stepped down from her post as White House press secretary in June 2019, but she is still a fervent Trump ally.\n\nLead Stories reached out to Sanders, but did not receive a response by the time of this writing. This story will be updated if she responds.\n\nThe content of the misattributed tweet is a variation on a quote by Benjamin Franklin: \"Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.\"", "lang": "en"}
