Both sets of figures are for those working in publicly-funded schools.\n\nThe SNP began governing Scotland in 2007, in a minority administration. The revised statistics for 2007 (published in 2009 to correct data errors) show the total number of teachers was 55,089. This was made up of 52,452 school-based staff, 964 classed as centrally-employed, and 1,672 teaching in pre-school.\n\nThe latest statistics published in December 2016 show Scotland\u2019s total number of publicly-funded schoolteachers at 50,970.\n\nThe general trend during the SNP\u2019s decade in government has been a reduction in teacher numbers, with over 4,000 fewer staff than in 2007.\n\nThere were also significant cuts to teacher training places in Scotland between 2007 and 2010, a decision that the SNP argued was to counteract an oversupply of teachers which left many unable to find work. Recently, education secretary John Swinney admitted the Scottish Government had \u201cprobably over-corrected too far\u201d, and places have been increased for the last six years.\n\nIn defence of its record in government, the SNP and Nicola Sturgeon have often pointed out that the ratio of pupils to teachers has been maintained as there have been fewer children attending school.\n\nPupil to student ratios are also collated yearly, and give an indication of the ability of a teacher to give each pupil the appropriate level of attention and assistance. A higher ratio means there are more pupils to each school teacher.\n\nOn this measure the picture looks better for the SNP. Ratios have increased slightly since they assumed power, though in both primary and secondary school ratios have flatlined or marginally decreased in the last few years. This could be attributed to a decrease in the number of pupils in education in Scotland.\n\nThere are a number of ways in which the Scottish Government\u2019s record can be measured. Some claims that have been made on education have been misleading, but it is clear that Kezia Dugdale\u2019s statement on teacher numbers does add up.\n\nWhile the SNP have pointed to the ratio of pupils to teachers staying at a similar level, there is no doubt that teacher numbers have significantly declined during the SNP\u2019s time in charge at Holyrood. The Scottish Labour leader\u2019s claim that there are 4,000 fewer teachers in Scotland\u2019s schools than when Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s party came into power is accurate.\n\nIn response to an evidence request, Scottish Labour provided FFS with links to the Summary Statistics for Schools in Scotland 2016 report.\n\nThe Ferret was established in 2015 with a mission to publish fearless, high quality journalism.
