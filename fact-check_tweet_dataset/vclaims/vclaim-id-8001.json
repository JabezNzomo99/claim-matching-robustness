Furthermore, his claim that the app was created in Chechnya by a local developer is likely also false.\n\nFor testing purposes, we created an account in Mylistory and discovered certain oddities suggesting the app is controlled and used by Kadyrov\u2019s team as a propaganda tool -- and, possibly, a surveillance tool.\n\nCreating a Mylistory account is similar to how it\u2019s done on a majority of other social networks: the app asks you for an email address, a \u201cNickname\u201d and a password. It is even easier if you have an account with Facebook or its Russian analog vKontakte:you can sign up using either of these. The privacy setting is also standard: Myliststory requests access to your microphone, speech recognition, camera, photos, contacts and location.\n\nOnce you have an account with Mylistory, two things happen instantly: the app tells you who to follow, and somebody almost immediately follows you, no matter how obscure you appear. Studying these two lists provides insight into who controls Mylistory, and to what extent.\n\nOnce you hit a \u201csearch\u201d icon, Mylistory\u2019s gives you a list of 38 profiles, all belonging to people or institutions closely related to the head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.\n\n\u200bNumber One \u2013 Ramzan Kadyrov\u2019s Russian language profile. As was the case with his Instagram account (which Facebook deleted because of the U.S. sanctions), Kadyrov shares videos and pictures of his daily life, both personal and professional, and publishes statements and announcements. His home videos are an ostentatious demonstration of wealth in a republic still emerging from the rubble after two devastating wars with Russia. Kadyrov came to power after living in poverty like the majority of Chechens, and his official salary is nothing close to what would support his lavish lifestyle. According to the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, one of many Kadyrov\u2019s houses built in 2010 and cost 10 billion rubles (approximately $33 million). Kadyrov\u2019s official annual salary has been growing over the years reaching its highest 11.5 million rubles in 2016 (about $174,000)\n\nNumber Two \u2013Grozny TV. A state-owned Chechen TV channel, The Independent newspaper called it \u201cKadyrov TV\u201d because of the Chechen leader\u2019s control over its programming and his omnipresence in its broadcasts.\n\nNumber Three \u2013 Magomed Daudov, aka Lord. The speaker of the Chechen parliament and one of Kadyrov\u2019s closest allies. Daudov has been on the U.S. \u201cMagnitsky list\u201d since December 2014.\n\nDaudov frequently garners international attention for violations of human rights and freedom of speech. In his latest Mylistory post, Daudov mocked Lithuania \u2013 a country he said he \u201ccould not locate on the map\u201d \u2013 for adding his name along with his boss\u2019 on Lithuania\u2019s own Magnitsky list.\n\nNumber Four \u2013 Turpal-Ali Ibragimov, aka Bistriy [Russian for \u201cSwift\u201d]. Ramzan Kadyrov\u2019s secretary, cousin and the head of Chechnya\u2019s Shali district, the republic\u2019s largest municipal territory.\n\nIbragimov also serves as chairman of Chechnya\u2019s infamous \u201cCitizen\u2019s Council\u201d \u2013 a kind of morality police that reportedly dictates social rules and identifies and punishes dissidents, including sexual minorities, and relatives of the suspected rebels.\n\nNumber Five \u2013Akhmat Fight Club. Ramzan Kadyrov\u2019s personal mixed martial arts (MMA) project. Akhmat Fight Club is famous for offering honorariums that are oversized even by the UFC standards, and for attracting big names like Mike Tyson.\n\nThe fight club is also known for videos of cage fights featuring preadolescent children, including Kadyrov\u2019s own sons, which have drawn international criticism.\n\nBesides Ramzan Kadyrov himself, who is probably the champion of his own social network, Mylistory\u2019s top list of \u201cwho to follow\u201d does not seem to be based on popularity, but on how close and how useful the people and entities are to the head of Chechnya.\n\nSeven strangers started following Polygraph.info as soon as the Mylistory account was established. Three of them clearly are local retailers advertising goods, such as furniture makers, and these we left out of this fact-check.\n\nThe others, however, seem to share the self-description \u201cpekhotinets KRA\u201d [KRA\u2019s foot soldier]. KRA is the abbreviation for \u201cKadyrov, Ramzan Akhmatovich,\u201d which is used by Kadyrov\u2019s subordinates. especially members of his personal guard or army, also known as \u201cKadyrovtsy.\u201d The \u201cfoot soldier\u201d phrase became a motto in Chechnya after Kadyrov declared himself Vladimir Putin\u2019s foot soldier.\n\n\u200bThe slain Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya called them \u201cKadyrov\u2019s death squad.\u201d Four Chechens have been convicted for her 2006 murder.\n\nThe \u201cKadyrovtsy\u201d have been linked to numerous high-profile assassinations both in Russia and abroad, including the murder of Vladimir Putin\u2019s political opponent Boris Nemtsov, and several Chechen figures Ramzan Kadyrov viewed as rivals.\n\nThe \"Kadyrovtsy\" have reportedly been involved in Russian operations in Ukraine's Crimea and in Donbass regions, as well as in Syria.\n\nWe do not have sufficient factual evidence to prove that \u201cKRA\u2019s foot soldiers\u201d have instantly followed the Polygraph.info account in Mylistory for surveillance purposes. However, it would be accurate to say that they are demonstrating special interest in watching the new arrivals.", "lang": "en"}
