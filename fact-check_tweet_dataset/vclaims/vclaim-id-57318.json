Protesters had cordoned off the several-block area near downtown Seattle after police withdrew from a police station, according to USA Today.\n\n\u201cSeattle after CHAZ,\u201d reads the caption. \u201cBut wait! There\u2019s more! If you vote Democrat your city can become a shithole too!\u201d (RELATED: Does This Video Show Brooklyn Residents Singing \u2018Juicy\u2019 During The Coronavirus Pandemic?)\n\nHowever, the image does not show trash from CHAZ. Greenpointers, a website focused on Brooklyn\u2019s Greenpoint neighborhood, published an article reporting that it shows garbage near the intersection of West and Huron Streets in New York. In the Google Maps street view of that intersection, the same green fencing and red brick building in the background are visible, confirming the location.\n\nGreenpointers on June 2 posted footage of the trash on Instagram, with the caption saying, \u201cThe large amount of trash sprawled across West Street on Tuesday morning was caused by a lit cigarette tossed from an apartment erupting the pile of trash bags in flames, surveillance video shows, and is apparently not related to the demonstrations last night.\u201d\n\nThere were protests against police brutality and racial injustice across New York City on June 1, according to The New York Times.", "lang": "en"}
