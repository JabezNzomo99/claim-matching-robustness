But FACTLY found that the same video was found to be uploaded on YouTube and Facebook in 2015 with the title: \u2018Sex workers fleeing after FIA raid at a brothel in Karachi\u2019. So, it can be concluded that it is an old video and not related to the current lockdown. More information about the incident in the video can be read in an article debunked by FACTLY earlier.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
