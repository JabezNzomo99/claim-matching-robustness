She had told her parents she was playing tennis.\n\nWhen she didn't return, Boston-based Bain Capital, where Romney was founder and CEO, essentially shut down to help search for Gay's 14-year-old daughter Melissa.\n\nBain Capital's 50 employees went to New York, where they convinced more than 200 other people to help search the streets for two days. They printed and passed out fliers. Romney clearly had a leading role in the company's operations, but news reports from the time also said other Bain partners helped coordinate the search effort.\n\nAccording to news reports, the teen was found in suburban New Jersey. A teenaged boy, who took her in after her partying, called authorities late on July 11.\n\nLt. David Peterson of the Montville Township Police said police reports at the time do not mention Romney, but Peterson and reports at the time show the Bain Capital search generated important attention to the case of the missing girl.\n\n\"The thing was it was a 911 caller that saw her on channel 7 and called in,\" said Peterson, who recalled waiting for the girl to be picked up from Montville police station.\n\nGay says Romney helped \"save\" his daughter, though previous reports have differed on the condition she was in. \"Doctors told Gay she might not have lived another day,\" according to the Boston Globe in 2002.\n\nNewsday reported in July 1996 that \"Melissa's parents said she was physically unharmed though she appeared 'very fragile.' The family's doctor had examined the girl and pronounced her in fairly good condition. ...\"\n\n\"She was not harmed,\" Robert Gay said at new conference after she was found, according to the New York Daily News . \"She was in tears. We just gave her hugs and brought her back home.\"\n\nThe ad says Romney \"helped save\" the girl, and we certainly aren't going to argue over the physical condition of the girl when she was found. Her Dad says she was \"saved,\" and under the circumstances we won't disagree. The ad also says Romney \"helped.\" Hard to argue with that either. True.", "lang": "en"}
