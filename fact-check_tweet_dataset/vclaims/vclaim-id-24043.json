Many users may have mistaken it for genuinely breaking news though, because The British Journal originally published the article with the BBC\u2019s old breaking news image. It has since changed this to a generic \u201cbreaking news\u201d image.\n\nThat matter aside, a wide range of other economists have criticised Economists for Free Trade\u2019s estimate about the economic gains from a no deal Brexit.\n\nWhere does \u00a3135 billion come from?\n\nTwo years ago Economists for Free Trade (EFT) claimed that the UK economy would be better off by \u201cas much as \u00a3135 billion a year\u201d if the UK left the EU without a deal and unilaterally eliminated all trade barriers, including tariffs on imports.\n\nOf the \u00a3135 billion, \u00a380 billion was estimated to come from \u201cfree trade\u201d, \u00a340 billion from reducing regulation, \u00a34 billion from reducing benefit payments to unskilled EU migrants, and \u00a311 billion from no longer paying into the EU budget.\n\nBut a wide range of other economists have criticised the group\u2019s estimates and we\u2019ve looked at a few of their main points below.\n\nThe benefits of free trade have been heavily questioned\n\nMuch of the criticism of EFT\u2019s calculation has focused on the points about \u201cfree trade\u201d\u2014where it identifies the bulk of the economic growth to come from. EFT\u2019s argument is essentially that, if the UK left the EU on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms, it could remove all tariffs and non-tariff barriers on imports from anywhere in the world, which would reduce the prices paid by British consumers by 10%, which in turn would drive an upturn in the economy (GDP).\n\nThe 10% figure has been criticised. Researchers at the London School of Economics (LSE) said the figure \u201ccomes from looking at the differences in price levels between the UK and some other countries and arguing that these higher prices are due to protectionism caused mainly by EU regulations (non-tariff barriers).\u201d\n\nHowever, this argument ignores the possibility that prices in EU markets may be higher for other reasons, for example because EU consumers buy better quality products.\n\nThe LSE continues: \u201csay Europeans put a higher premium on high-quality clothing compared with Americans. It will look like Europeans are paying more for their clothes, but in reality, the higher average prices simply reflect a different mix of purchases.\u201d\n\nAlso the data used by the EFT comes from 2002, meaning the estimates are quite out of date.\n\nThe issue of \u201cnon-tariff barriers\u201d has also been contested\n\nEconomists have also challenged the EFT\u2019s assumption that UK exporters would not face increased non-tariff barriers to trade with the EU if we left on WTO terms. The Institute for Government describes this assumption as \u201cextreme\u201d.\n\nNon-tariff barriers are things like regulatory standards which trading partners have to comply with. They can limit the amount of trade which two countries are able to do together.\n\nIt is estimated that the non-tariff barriers faced by non-EU members exporting to the EU range from 7%-21% of the value of those goods (whereas members of the EU single market don\u2019t face such barriers when trading with one another).\n\nThe EFT acknowledges this, yet believes that UK exporters would not face new non-tariff barriers if the UK left the EU on WTO terms because WTO rules wouldn\u2019t allow it.\n\nThe Institute for Government says: \u201cWTO law is not strong enough to compel the EU to abandon the legal requirements of the Single Market\u201d, a finding supported by trade law experts. This would mean the UK would likely face significant non-tariff barriers on exports to the EU if it adopted the policy proposed by EFT.", "lang": "en"}
