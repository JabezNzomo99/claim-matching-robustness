(Published 2018)", "subtitle": "Democrats are demanding that the Senate majority leader delay confirmation proceedings during an election year, citing his refusal to consider an Obama nominee in 2016.", "author": "www.nytimes.com", "date": "2018-06-28T01:04:52.000Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-4273", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/us/politics/fact-check-supreme-court-senate-confirm.html", "vclaim": "\u201cThe American people\u200e should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\u201d Mr. McConnell said in a statement released the night Justice Scalia died.\n\n\u201cAll we are doing is following the longstanding tradition of not fulfilling a nomination in the middle of a presidential year,\u201d he said in a March 2016 interview with Fox News Sunday.\n\nMr. McConnell\u2019s claim then of keeping to tradition was incorrect, given that the Senate has rejected a Supreme Court nominee one other time in an outgoing president\u2019s final months in modern history. And Democrats have a point in noting now that the crux of Mr. McConnell\u2019s argument \u2014 to give voters a say in the process \u2014 could also apply to the midterm elections since senators must confirm Supreme Court nominations.\n\nStill, it is clear from statements, news conferences, interviews and in speeches on the Senate floor, Mr. McConnell consistently and specifically said that \u201cthe presidential election process\u201d \u2014 and not \u201ca lame-duck president\u201d \u2014 should decide the next Supreme Court justice.", "lang": "en"}
