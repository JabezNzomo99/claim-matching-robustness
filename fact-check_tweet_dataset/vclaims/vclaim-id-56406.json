They were providing a local shuttle service, not transporting protesters.\n\nSoros, a billionaire investor who donates to various progressive causes through his Open Society Foundations, has been a popular target for false rumors.\n\nIn recent weeks, social media users have circulated posts claiming Soros bused rioters into recent protests, with this particular post sharing an image of the alleged buses used. The words \u201cSoros Riot Dance Squad\u201d appear on the sides of both buses.\n\n\u201cGeorge Soros busing the rioters in,\u201d the post\u2019s caption reads. \u201cNWO deep state activity.\u201d (RELATED: Did 163 Paid Protesters File A Lawsuit Against George Soros For Not Paying Their Bail?)\n\nHowever, the photo of two buses passing through a gas station in a town near Ann Arbor, Michigan, has been digitally manipulated. In the edited photo, the words \u201cSoros Riot Dance Squad\u201d have been superimposed onto them.\n\nThe Associated Press first reported that the pictured buses belong to Golden Limousine International. The company\u2019s owner, Sean Duval, explained in an email to the Daily Caller that a photo of the buses fueling at a gas station after providing their daily shuttle service to a local company has been doctored. In reality, they don\u2019t have any writing on them.\n\n\u201cThe only intention was to create controversy and discord,\u201d Duval said. \u201cThe second post was doctored to make the first one appear even worse. This is an obvious and provable fake.\u201d\n\nIn an email to the Caller, a representative for Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations also refuted the claim, saying, \u201cThese are fabrications; there are no buses connected to Mr. Soros or the Open Society Foundations.\u201d\n\nThe doctored photo started circulating amid nationwide protests against racial inequality and police brutality after George Floyd died on May 25 in Minneapolis police custody. There is no evidence Soros has orchestrated any organized networks of out-of-town rioters, according to The Associated Press.", "lang": "en"}
