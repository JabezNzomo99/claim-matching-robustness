(Original caption - Gusano en el labio).\n\nHowever, BOOM cannot independently verify the origins of the video.\n\nThe Coronavirus is microscopic (not visible to the naked eye) and is not a larva / insect as seen in the viral video.\n\nAdditionally none of the research or advisories from any country have mentioned the steps recommended in the viral message. The official Twitter handle of the Ministry of Health had shared preventive measures recommended by the World Health Organisation, however there are no measures recommended as stated in the viral message.\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Coronavirus In China: India On Alert", "lang": "en"}
