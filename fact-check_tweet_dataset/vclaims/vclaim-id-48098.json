Is this form of scam possible? Is it plausible? Is it common? Has it ever occurred at all?\n\nThose are the questions we applied to the following social media meme, which posits a \u201cscam\u201d involving the theft of wallets from purses sitting in grocery carts and related residential burglaries:\n\nThe meme contains no detail that would allow tracking its narrative to a particular crime, and we\u2019ve turned up no verified reports of a similar occurrence. What we can say is that although the theft of purses effected while their owners\u2019 attention is focused elsewhere is not uncommon, the burglary aspect of this warning seems to be based on long-outmoded premises about how Americans live and work that would render it extremely unlikely today.\n\nFor starters, you\u2019re a prospective burglar. You\u2019ve lifted a woman\u2019s wallet from her purse. Now you need to call her to lure her out of her house, but \u2026 what phone number do you call?\n\nThis \u201cscam\u201d seemingly hearkens back to the days of landlines, when one could often tie information gleaned from a driver\u2019s license (i.e., full name and address) to a phone number through the use of a phone directory or directory assistance. But no similar mechanism exists for now-ubiquitous cellphones. (Possibly one could use the internet to quickly match up a name and address with a phone number, but the odds aren\u2019t good.)\n\nMoreover, this scheme relies on the out-of-date notion that if a woman is away from home in the middle of the day, her residence will then necessarily be unoccupied (because, of course, the man of the house will be out working somewhere, and the kids will be in school). But a variety of different domestic scenarios are common these days that would place other people at home in the middle of the day: a woman might be living with roommates or parents or adult children; some 40 per cent of Americans work mostly during nonstandard times and are therefore home during the daytime; working at home is becoming increasingly common, etc.\n\nAs well, just because a residence is unoccupied by human beings doesn\u2019t preclude the possibility that a security system, barking dog, attentive neighbors, or some other impediment to a broad-daylight burglary isn\u2019t present. And in fact, as police routinely point out, most residential burglaries are crimes of opportunity and involve very little planning on the part of the thief (like the type posited here).\n\nAll in all, a crook who has successfully lifted a woman\u2019s wallet is much more likely going to be content with the bounty found within (e.g., cash, debit cards, credit cards) than with trying to parlay that score into a risky residential burglary. And your residence is far more likely to be the target of an opportunistic, spur-of-the-moment burglary than of one involving an elaborate scheme to lure you away from home.\n\nThe best advice to be gleaned from this warning is to be sure not to leave purses (or other valuable items) unwatched \u2014 even for the briefest of moments \u2014 in shopping carts, in restrooms, and in automobiles. And engage in some simple security precautions to make your home less of an inviting target for theft.", "lang": "en"}
