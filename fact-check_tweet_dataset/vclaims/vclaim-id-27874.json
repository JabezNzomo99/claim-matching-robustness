The post shows a picture of a 2013 petition saying this exemption \u201cdoes not apply to other religions\u201d.\n\nThis is not correct.\n\nThe House of Commons Library said in 2018 that this claim and others like it have \u201cno basis in council tax law\u201d. It added: \u201cIt is not possible for owners of domestic property to avoid council tax by claiming that their property, or part of it, is used for religious purposes\u201d.\n\nThe briefing did note it would be \u201ctheoretically possible\u201d for part of a home (not all of it) being used for public religious purposes to be to be \u201cseparately valued for business rates, and to be removed from the council tax valuation list\u201d. But it also said that in such a case, the Valuation Office Agency (the government body that supplies property valuations for tax purposes) \u201cwould have to be satisfied that this reflected the real use of the property\u201d. And it points out that this \u201cwould be unlikely to make more than a minimal difference to the council tax bill on the remainder of the property.\u201d\n\nCouncil tax is charged on homes, and the only exemption or discount relating to religion is for members of \u201creligious communities\u201d, for example nuns living in a convent. There is no exemption that applies only to Muslims.\n\nBuildings registered for public religious worship are exempt from business rates\n\nBuildings of public worship belonging to the Church of England (or Wales) and their church or chapel halls are automatically official places of worship.\n\nIn England and Wales, a place of worship for any other religion or denomination has to apply to the General Register Office to be classed as an official place of religious worship, and so be exempt from business rates.\n\nThe application needs to include things like a weekly timetable of activities and a floorplan of the site. To be granted this status \u201cthe Registrar General must be satisfied that [the place\u2019s] principal use is for worship\u201d.\n\nIn Scotland and Northern Ireland, places of worship can apply for business rate relief as part of the exemption for charities.", "lang": "en"}
