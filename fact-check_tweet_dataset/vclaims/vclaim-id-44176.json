Remind me again why we have to pay their $174,000+ salaries if they\u2019re refusing to go to work?\u201d\n\nIn a search of the HEROES Act, also known as H.R. 6800, no such language about an extended recess could be found. A Democratic House leadership aide confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller that there is no provision related to congressional recess in the HEROES Act.\n\nEarlier on May 15, the House approved H.R. 967, a resolution that set forth the rules for debate on both the HEROES Act and H.R. 965, which allows for proxy voting. The resolution did not contain any language outlining an extended recess but did state the House could adjourn \u201con any legislative day during the period from May 19, 2020, through July 21, 2020.\u201d\n\nThat sort of language is standard practice in House rules, according to USA Today.

It convened for legislative business at 9 a.m. this morning, according to the House Clerk\u2019s office website.", "lang": "en"}
