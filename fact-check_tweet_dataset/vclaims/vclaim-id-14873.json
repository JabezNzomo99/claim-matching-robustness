It shows Rahul Gandhi\u2019s last name replaced with an abusive word. A Twitter user Chowkidar Pooran Bajaj Bjp\u200f, who is followed by railway minister Piyush Goyal, was among those who shared the poster.\n\nAnother user followed by Goyal, Sashi (@Patlliputra), also circulated the poster.\n\nAlt News found that the identical image was viral last year. Sanjib Ghosh, who is followed by BJP Delhi spokesperson Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga, apart from being followed by Goyal, had shared it on August 2018.\n\nLast year, a Twitter user Madhusagar had replied to a person who had shared the image that the banner was fake. Madhusagar had posted an original photograph of the Congress poster, which clearly said \u2013 \u201cRahul Gandhi.\u201d\n\nAlt News also found that a Telugu website, Telugu Rajyam, had debunked the image when it was viral in 2018. This website too had uploaded an original photograph of the poster.\n\nWe further discovered a YouTube channel B News which had shared a video of the real hoarding.\n\nRahul Gandhi\u2019s name on the original banner was, thus, photoshopped with an offensive word. Earlier, Alt News had found that a poster of the Aam Aadmi Party was photoshopped in a similar manner to target Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal.", "lang": "en"}
