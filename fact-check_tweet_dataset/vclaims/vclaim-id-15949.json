The video is supported by the caption \u201cThis is the treatment of cancer.\u201d Vishwas news investigated the video and it was found to be misleading.\n\nAs per the viral Facebook video, the wild pigeon can cure hepatitis by \u2018sucking\u2019 out viruses from the navel of the person suffering from hepatitis. In the video, a man could be seen lying down and another person demonstrates how a pigeon could suck the virus of hepatitis from the suffering man by pressing the pigeon\u2019s anus on the navel of the man. The video suggests that as soon as one pigeon dies, the pigeon should be replaced. When the pigeons stop dying, the patient is cured. The caption written with the video reads: \u201cThis is the treatment of cancer.\u201d\n\nThe video claims that a pigeon could suck out the hepatitis virus from the navel of a person suffering from hepatitis. The caption of the video says that this is a treatment of cancer. This means that the treatment using pigeons can cure both cancer and hepatitis.\n\nThe viral post has been shared on Facebook by the page \u201cThe Lallu Top.\u201d The video has 588K views, 6.3K reactions, 288 comments, and 14,670 shares.\n\nWe looked upon the comments on the viral Facebook post and found that many users questioned the authenticity of the video, calling it fake.\n\nWe investigated further and tried finding out scientific studies on the hepatitis treatment as shared on the viral post. There is no scientific basis for this treatment.\n\nWe contacted a doctor and this is what he quoted:\n\nDr. Sajeev Kumar, C.S.C, D.C.H, M.B.B.S, General Physician: \u201cFAKE. There is no way to suck off viruses by pigeon. This treatment cannot cure hepatitis or cancer.\u201d\n\nQuoting the example of the treatment using pigeon to cure hepatitis, the position paper of the ethics bureau of the Israel Medical Association states that, \u201cpeople tend to follow treatments based on religion and faith when medicine has no solution, and patients and their families are desperate.\u201d Nowhere has it been mentioned that this process of treatment has been scientifically proven.\n\nWe used StalkScan to check the profile of the page \u2018The Lallu Top\u2019 and found multiple misleading posts on its profile.\n\nViral Facebook video claiming that wild pigeon can cure hepatitis by \u2018sucking\u2019 out viruses from the navel is misleading. The claim that this treatment can be used to cure cancer is false.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right. If you have a doubt on any news that could impact you, society or the nation, let us know.
