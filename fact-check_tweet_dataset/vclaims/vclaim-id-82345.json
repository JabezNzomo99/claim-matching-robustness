The false claims had found their way into mainstream media as well.\n\nAfter MyNation\u2019s report was debunked, the outlet removed the girl\u2019s photograph (although it continues to adorn the article\u2019s Hindi version).\n\nNews organisation Newslaundryspoke to the family of the girl in question. The child\u2019s father confirmed that his daughter\u2019s photograph was used without their permission or knowledge.\n\nThe videos of Rahul Gandhi\u2019s multiple addresses in Dubai were uploaded by the Congress. In one of the events, held at IMT Dubai University, a teenaged girl did ask Gandhi a few questions (from 28:22 below). However, neither were these questions as claimed by MyNation nor was Gandhi \u2018dumbfounded\u2019 by them.\n\nThe girl in the video posted above is Amala Babu Thomas, a grade 10 student. She was the youngest person to question Gandhi. After false claims about the address began to surface online, her father uploaded a video of her reiterating the questions she asked and clarifying that a certain section of the media floated misinformation around her interaction with the Congress president.\n\nAmala asked the following question to Gandhi \u2013 \u201cThe Indian National Congress has been successful over 188 years, starting from the period of Dr Annie Besant to transgenders being included in central politics. My question is that women in rural India, the heart of India, have not been given much opportunities or attention compared to the women we have in central politics. What will be your programs to make rural women the attention of central politics?\n\nShe further continued, \u201cI would also like to know \u2013 most of the kids in India have undergone child abuse and child mortality. How would you change in case you become the Prime Minister of India.\u201d\n\nNone of these questions matched the questions MyNation claimed Rahul Gandhi was asked. First \u2013 \u201cHow Rahul Gandhi, who speaks about how caste distinction is rampant, embraced Hinduism while applying ashes on his forehead in Gujarat and wore the kufis (traditional cap that Muslims wear) while visiting Kashmir\u201d; and second \u2013 \u201cCongress prides itself for having ruled India for several decades. The welfare and development that were not achieved then, will be done now?\u201d\n\nAlt News went through the entire length of the 43-minute address to confirm if any other person in Amala\u2019s age group raised questions similar to the ones claimed by MyNation. We did not find any other school student interacting with Gandhi.\n\nIn the most recent update to its story, MyNation claimed that the Congress president answered one of the questions with the counter question \u2013 \u201cWhat will you do if you were the Prime Minister?\u201d\n\nWe found that Gandhi posed a similar question to a girl \u2013 \u201cif you were the Prime Minister of India, what would be your three focus areas?\u201d However, she could not have been between 14-16 age group as she had introduced herself as an MBA student.\n\nMyNation used a minor\u2019s photograph and later deleted it from its report without an apology. The girl who actually had an interaction with Gandhi also clarified via a video statement that she did not ask him the questions viral on social media. Despite the facts, MyNation editor Abhijit Majumdar stood by his outlet\u2019s reportage. He told Newslaundry, \u201cWe ran the story based on information we obtained from reliable sources. We confirmed it with Congress\u2019s overseas secretary Aarathi Krishnan and her office. While we do not have the video, we have enough phone and other trails to defend our story should we need to. MyNation stands by its story.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018confirmation\u2019 Majumdar referred to also was also refuted by the source, Congress\u2019s overseas secretary Aarathi Krishna, who tweeted that she was misquoted by the outlet.\n\nIt is clear that MyNation\u2019s \u201cRahul Gandhi dumbfounded by a 14-year-old\u2019s questions\u201d story doesn\u2019t stand up to the scrutiny of facts. But the more concerning issue at hand is the outlet\u2019s reluctance to take it down despite the undeniable evidence of their story being false.", "lang": "en"}
