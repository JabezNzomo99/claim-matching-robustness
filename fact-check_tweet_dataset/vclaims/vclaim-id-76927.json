Mitt grew up in a wealthy Michigan suburb, attending prep school and ultimately Harvard.\n\n \n\n He's been the target of silver-spoon attacks because he\u2019s worth more than $100 million. (Perhaps far more.)\n\n \n\n But Republicans argue he wasn\u2019t handed his wealth \u2014 he earned it.\n\n \n\n He even \"gave away his father\u2019s inheritance,\" national committee chair Reince Priebus repeatedly told TV interviewers on Aug. 26, 2012, as the party prepared to open its convention.\n\n \n\n We\u2019ve rated a related claim from Romney himself that he \"didn\u2019t inherit money\" from his parents. That earned a Half True, because he previously told interviewers he did get an inheritance, but donated it to Brigham Young University.\n\n \n\n This time we\u2019re checking whether he \"gave away his father\u2019s inheritance.\"\n\n \n\n We\u2019re short on primary evidence for the claim \u2014 we haven\u2019t seen his father\u2019s will, nor a receipt from Brigham Young. But there\u2019s a strong circumstantial case that Priebus is correct.\n\n \n\n Rich get richer\n\n \n\n George Romney died in 1995 at age 88. By that time, his son had led Bain Capital, the private equity firm he launched in 1984, for more than a decade.\n\n \n\n As Romney told a C-SPAN interviewer in 2006:\n\n \n\n \"I did get a check from my dad when he passed away. I shouldn\u2019t say a check, but I did inherit some funds from my dad. But I turned and gave that away to charity. In this case I gave it to a school which Brigham Young University established in his honor. ... And that\u2019s where his inheritance ended up.\"\n\n \n\n Why did he give the money away?\n\n \n\n \"I figured we had enough of our own,\" he said.\n\n \n\n According to a short history of the George W. Romney Institute of Public Management at BYU, the family provided an endowment in 1998, within a few years of George Romney's death.\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n Reince Priebus says that Romney \"gave away his father's inheritance.\"\n\n \n\n Romney has repeatedly said so himself and that's backed up by the simple fact that Brigham Young University has an institute named for his father launched just a few years after his death. And there\u2019s no reason to think Romney would have needed the money a decade after his lucrative move to Bain Capital.\n\n \n\n We find the evidence supports the claim and we see nothing to contradict it. If any evidence emerges, we'll review it. But in the meantime, we rate Priebus\u2019 claim True.", "lang": "en"}
