We will remove the BJP from Cooch Behar for sure, warned Mamata.\" (Translated from Bengali text: \u2018\u2018\u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09af\u09bc\u09cb\u099c\u09a8\u09c7 MIM \u098f\u09b0 \u09b8\u09be\u09a5\u09c7 \u099c\u09cb\u099f \u0995\u09b0\u09ac\u09cb, \u0995\u09cb\u099a\u09ac\u09bf\u09b9\u09be\u09b0 \u09a5\u09c7\u0995\u09c7 \u09ac\u09bf\u099c\u09c7\u09aa\u09bf\u0995\u09c7 \u09b8\u09be\u09ab \u0995\u09b0\u09ac\u09cb\u0987. \u09b9\u09c1\u0999\u09cd\u0995\u09be\u09b0 \u09a6\u09bf\u09b2\u09c7\u09a8 \u09ae\u09ae\u09a4\u09be\u2019\u2019\n\nBelow is the screenshot of the morphed image that is viral on Facebook.\n\nThe Facebook post can be seen here and the post is archived here.\n\nThe edited screenshot, featuring the fake quote of Banerjee is being shared ahead of the by-elections in West Bengal that will take place in three Assembly constituencies Kaliaganj, Karimpur and Karagpur Sadar. The polls are scheduled for November 25, 2019.\n\nBanerjee recently took a jibe at Owaisi's All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) for planning to enter the Bengal politics arena. The chief minister said that Owaisi's entry will only \"serve to help the BJP by dividing minority votes.\"\n\nBOOM ran a relevant keyword search and found the original article that was uploaded to Zee 24's news portal on November 18.\n\nThe original headline of the article read, \"They take money from the BJP, Mamata has warned against Owaisi\u2019s AIMIM.\u2019\u2019 Read the article here.\n\nBOOM did a comparison of the screenshots of the morphed news article and the original article. While the dateline and image of both the articles are same, the headline has been tampered with.\n\nAt the November 18 event in Cooch Behar, Banerjee targeted AIMIM. Though she did not name the party, she asked people to refrain from listening to \"minority extremists\" who have their base in Hyderabad.\n\nOwaisi is a Lok Sabha MP from the city.\n\nIn reply to Banerjee's remark Asaduddin Owaisi retorted that Muslims in Bengal have one of the worst human development indicators among any minority.\n\nALSO READ: Amit Shah Did Not Say He Would Remove Bengalis From India", "lang": "en"}
