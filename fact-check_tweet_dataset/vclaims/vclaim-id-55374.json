His works, often filled with wit and satire, discussed many themes, including civil liberties and freedom of speech.\n\nThough the quote may reflect his views on freedom of speech, there is no evidence that Voltaire authored it. A search of his written works and correspondence returned nothing resembling the expression.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation also reached out to several experts, all of whom said the expression originated with Hall.\n\n\u201cThe quote is widely attributed to Voltaire but actually it was created by Evelyn Beatrice Hall, a biographer of Voltaire, who gave it as an example of Voltaire\u2019s thinking,\u201d City University of New York professor Marvin Carlson said in an email to the DCNF.\n\nIndeed, the earliest instance of the quote occurs in Hall\u2019s 1906 \u201cThe Friends of Voltaire,\u201d a biography of the French writer and philosopher originally published under Hall\u2019s pseudonym S.G. Tallentyre.\n\nIn the passage where the quote appears, Hall discusses Voltaire\u2019s reaction to news that the government had condemned and burned fellow French philosopher Claude-Adrien Helv\u00e9tius\u2019 book. Voltaire, according to Hall, did not find the substance of Helv\u00e9tius\u2019 work particularly impressive but was still dismayed by French Parliament\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201c\u2018I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it,\u2019 was his attitude now,\u201d wrote Hall.\n\nShe later clarified in a 1939 letter that, despite this phrase being in quotation marks, they were not Voltaire\u2019s words, insisting, \u201cThe phrase \u2026 is my own expression.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
