They will develop Begusarai. They aren't even ashamed.\"\n\nThe video shows a woman dancing in a car to the tune of a Hindi film song.\n\nAnd the images are those of Shehla Rashid, former vice president of Jawaharlal Nehru University's students union. Clearly, Gurmehar Kaur is not present either in the video or the images from Kanhaiya's campaign rally.\n\nThe post can be viewed here and the archived versions can be accessed here and here.\n\nThe 2.15 seconds long video shows a woman dancing inside a moving car while a group of youngsters cheer on. The song playing in the background is that of a Hindi film. The viral post claims that the woman in the video, and the one standing by Kanhaiya Kumar's side at the rally, are the same -- Gurmehar kaur. Both claims are false.\n\nThe post, as of now, is going viral, both, from Facebook and Twitter.\n\nGurmehar Kaur is a student activist and an author. In 2017, Kaur became the target of vicious trolling on Twitter after she made a statement 'Pakistan Did Not Kill My Dad, War Killed Him', on social media\n\nBOOM fact-checked the video and the images separately.\n\nWho is the woman in the car?\n\nBOOM went through the video carefully and observed the following points:\n\u2022 The car in the video is a left-hand drive\n\u2022 The bottle shown in the girl's hand has Al Ain imprinted on it. Al Ain is a famous bottled water brand in the UAE\n\nThis makes it clear that the video is not from India.\n\nBOOM then fragmented the video and took mugshots of the woman claimed to be Gurmehar, which we compared with pictures of Gurmehar we found online.\n\nWe also reached out to Gurmehar Kaur. She replied saying the claim was false.\n\nThe student activist also told us that she had campaigned for Kanhaiya Kumar in Begusarai.\n\nWhile BOOM confirmed that the woman shown in the video is not Gurmehar Kaur, we were unable to establish her identity but we found the same video on YouTube uploaded in August 2016.\n\nWho is the woman in the photo?\n\nA reverse image search on the picture directed us to several news reports carrying the same photo.\n\nThe woman in the photo is Shehla Rashid. Rashid is the former vice-president of JNU's student union and a member of the Jammu and Kashmir Peoples' Movement, a political outfit founded by former IAS officer Shah Faesal.\n\nRashid, along with several others, has been proactively campaigning for Kanhaiya Kumar who is ready to fight his maiden election from Begusarai.", "lang": "en"}
