Neither tweet is genuine; both were posted by parody accounts.\n\nA Facebook page called \u201cAustralians For Australia\u201d, which has nearly 20,000 followers, shared the two screenshots in this post dated June 5, 2019.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption says: \u201cWhen being \u2018Woke\u2019 crosses the line\u2026\u201d\n\nAccording to this dictionary definition, \u201cwoke\u201d means: \u201cAlert to injustice in society, especially racism\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe first image contained in the misleading post shows a tweet from an account called \u201cNintendo of America\u201d with an illustration of Mario and Luigi, characters created by Japanese video game giant Nintendo, kissing on the lips.\n\n\u201cHappy #PrideMonth! Our staff is filled with people of all sexualities so we love supporting that,\u201d says the caption on the tweet.\n\nJune was chosen as Pride Month in the US in commemoration of the Stonewall riots, a series of pro-LGBT demonstrations held in New York in June 1969; here is a US government web page about the initiative.\n\nSpliced under the screenshot is an image of another supposed tweet that says: \u201cAin\u2019t they brothers?\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of that part of the misleading post:\n\nThe second screenshot in the misleading post purports to show a tweet by Shigeru Miyamoto, the game designer who created the Mario series for Nintendo.\n\nHere is his IMDb profile and here is a 2010 New York Times article about him.\n\n\u201cSaw a picture of Mario and Luigi kissing one another online. Please do not do that,\u201d says the tweet, purportedly posted on April 24, 2014 by the account @RealShigeruM.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of that section of the post:\n\nThe same two screenshots were also retweeted hundreds of times after being shared on Twitter here.\n\nNeither of the tweets shown in the misleading post are from genuine, verified accounts.\n\nFormer deputy assistant to US President Donald Trump, Sebastian Gorka, appeared to have believed the false tweet by @NIntedoAmerica.\n\nNews site Indy100 reported here on June 7, 2019, that Gorka shared the Mario-Luigi kissing picture and wrote in a now-deleted tweet, stating: \u201cSo @NintendoAmerica is promoting incest now?\u201d\n\nThe image of Mario and Luigi kissing purports to be from a Twitter account called Nintendo of America, with the handle @NIntedoAmerica.\n\nHowever, the verified Nintendo of America Twitter account here has a similar but differently spelled handle: @NintendoAmerica.\n\nTwitter\u2019s blue verified badge, which the social network says \u201clets people know that an account of public interest is authentic\u201d, is present on Nintendo of America\u2019s official account, but not on the one in the misleading post.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the Twitter account details in the misleading post (L) and the official Nintendo of America account (R), with the discrepancies highlighted in green:\n\nA search in the online history of the verified Nintendo of America account from June 1 to 7, 2019, using this advanced search query, finds no such image or statement in support of Pride Month.\n\nThis Twitter account with the handle @realShigeruM has been suspended for violating Twitter rules.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the account:\n\nReports about the @RealShigeruM Twitter account on video game website Kotaku here and tech news blog Tech Digest here say that Miyamoto is not on Twitter and the profile is a parody account.\n\nThe Tech Digest article says, in part: \u201cShigeru Miyamoto, creator of Mario, Legend of Zelda, and the man responsible for most of the joy in your childhood, isn\u2019t on Twitter \u2013 but he is represented in the form of parody account @RealShigeruM. We don\u2019t know who is behind the account, but it is brilliant \u2013 here\u2019s our pick of the funniest tweets.\u201d\n\nNo verified accounts appear in this Twitter search for the name Shigeru Miyamoto, but there are several other profiles with the words \u201cparody account\u201d in their bio.\n\nOther similar false tweets and claims are being shared across social media, for example here on Twitter by an unverified account called \u201cNintendo News Network\u201d, here on Facebook and here on far-right social network Gab.", "lang": "en"}
