Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany at the start of 1933.\n\nThe video was first published by the Sun in July 2015.\n\nAt the time, Buckingham Palace said: \u201cIt is disappointing that film, shot eight decades ago and apparently from Her Majesty\u2019s personal family archive, has been obtained and exploited in this manner.\u201d\n\nThe full clip also shows Edward VIII (then Prince of Wales) and Princess Margaret (then around three years-old) doing the salute. The Queen would have been around seven years-old at the time.\n\nThe Second World War started six years later, in 1939. The Queen joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service, which was then the women\u2019s branch of the army, full time in 1945.\n\nIn their article, the Sun wrote that there was \u201cclearly no suggestion that the Queen or Queen Mother were ever Nazi sympathisers\u201d. The Sun defended publishing the images by saying they provided \u201ca fascinating insight into the warped prejudices of Edward VIII\u201d, who has long been accused of being sympathetic to the Nazis, and would later meet Hitler while visiting Germany in 1937 after he abdicated.", "lang": "en"}
