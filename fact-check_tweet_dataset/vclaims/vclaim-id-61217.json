He\u2019s running against incumbent Democrat Mark Begich and, on the Republican side, tea partier Joe Miller and Alaska Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell. We decided to sort this out.\n\n\"Stand your ground\" was first introduced in the Alaska Legislature in 2010. At the time, Sullivan served as the state\u2019s attorney general, heading an office that reviews every law moving through the Legislature.\n\nThe original \"stand your ground\" bill failed to pass. A second iteration of the bill appeared and failed in 2011.\n\nSullivan left the attorney general\u2019s office to become the commissioner of natural resources at the end of 2010 -- long before a final version of the bill passed in 2013. So even though \"stand your ground\" first appeared in the Alaska Legislature when Sullivan was in a position to put his support behind it, it wasn\u2019t successful until he had moved on to other positions.\n\nWe came across one indication of Sullivan and the attorney general office\u2019s position on \"stand your ground,\" but it doesn\u2019t help his case. His office sent a in March 2010 that attacks the heart of \"stand your ground\" law.\n\nThe letter uses strong language and primarily takes issue with the fact that the law would remove the then-existing \"duty to retreat.\" \"Duty to retreat\" means that if a person believes that they are in imminent danger of death or severe bodily harm, but there is a safe way for them to get away, they are expected to retreat without assaulting or killing the person threatening them.\n\n\"Whatever source one thinks our laws should be drawn from -- the 10 commandments which say 'thou shalt not kill,' simple morality, utilitarianism principles of the greater good or simply the concept that life is sacred -- this bill would encourage the needless taking of human life,\" the letter reads.\n\nAlthough the letter seems to make Sullivan\u2019s position fairly clear, he now has a twofold defense:\n\nFirst, his campaign says the letter took issue with the bill\u2019s , rather than \"stand your ground\" laws in general. That doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.\n\nWhen we read the letter, we found that nearly half of it criticized the bill for nearly eliminating the duty to retreat -- contradicting the core of \"stand your ground,\" according to some experts. \"Duty to retreat\" and \"stand your ground\" laws cannot coexist, as the names suggest.\n\n\"Someone who opposes a self-defense statute that provides that there\u2019s no \u2018duty to retreat\u2019 is also against a typical \u2018stand your ground\u2019 statute,\" said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nTo be fair, we also found that the letter brings up problems with specific language and lack of clarity, and it never says outright that the Legislature should abandon its efforts to pass \"stand your ground.\" But it does say that the bill \"would promote violence and be a bad idea for (Alaska).\"\n\nSecond, he did not pen or approve of the letter even though his name is included in the signature. (A then-assistant attorney general John Skidmore wrote it.) Sullivan\u2019s name was included on any piece of paper that left his office -- even if he didn\u2019t see it first.\n\nThere are nearly 200 assistant attorneys general, and a lot of legislation passes through that office, so it is conceivable that he wasn\u2019t aware that the letter was going out, said Cori Mills, spokeswoman for the Alaska Department of Law.\n\nHowever, Skidmore wasn\u2019t the only assistant attorney general who had problems with the bill. About two weeks later -- after some tweaks had been made in response to the letter -- three other assistant attorney generals (all from different divisions) on behalf of the Department of Law at a House Judiciary Committee hearing.\n\nThe updated version made \"a bad bill better,\" said then-Assistant Attorney General Anne Carpeneti.\n\nWe asked Sullivan\u2019s campaign to point to any public statement showing his support for the law. They could only provide from state Rep. Mark Neuman, R-Big Lake. The undated letter briefly mentions the attorney general\u2019s office as supportive of the 2010 bill -- despite the obvious expressed at the hearing.\n\nThe language in the final bill hasn\u2019t changed since 2010, and the still eliminated the duty to retreat in most circumstances.\n\nA recent radio ad said, \"As Alaska\u2019s Attorney General, Sullivan successfully fought to protect our Second Amendment rights and passed \u2018stand your ground.\u2019 \"\n\nWe found that evidence of Sullivan\u2019s support for \"stand your ground\" is dubious at best. We couldn\u2019t find any public proof of his support, and multiple attorneys under him spoke out against the law. Even if he had publicly shown support for \"stand your ground,\" he wasn\u2019t in a position to push the legislation forward when the law finally passed in 2013.", "lang": "en"}
