The footage is actually from California in 2015, when more than 200 skydivers set a new world record.\n\nThe video has been repeatedly posted on social media, including here where it has been viewed around 246,000 times since it was published by a Pakistani Facebook page on March 23, 2019.\n\nThe post has a caption in Urdu which translates as: \"Enthralling demonstration by Pakistan Air Force on the occasion of Pakistan Day. Like the page.\"\n\nA patriotic Pakistani song plays in the background of the clip.\n\nThe video has also been shared by multiple other Facebook users, for example here and here \u2013 viewed around 235,000 times since it was published March 24, 2019 \u2013 and on YouTube here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of one of the false posts:\n\nThe first part of the footage is filmed in one continuous shot. But at the timestamp 1.35 it changes to a different, blurrier shot of a lone skydiver holding a Pakistani flag.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of that skydiver in the video:\n\nThe footage in the first part of the video is actually from September 2015, when 202 skydivers from nearly 30 different countries set a new record above Southern California.\n\nThe jumpers grabbed each other\u2019s arms and legs to create a giant lattice-like configuration at around 7,000 feet (2,100 metres).\n\nMultiple media outlets covered the skydiving world record in 2015, for example ABC News here and Global News Canada here.\n\nHere is footage of the original event on on the YouTube account of a southern California news outlet called the The Press-Enterprise \u2013 embedded below \u2013 and an online report.\n\nThe skydivers are wearing the same clothes as in the false Facebook post and the ground underneath them is also the same \u2013 with a distinctive pattern of roads, fields, and mountains clearly identifiable in both.\n\nThe image below compares a screenshot from the Press Enterprise footage (L) with a screenshot of the false Facebook post (R).\n\nThe same distinctive corner of a field has been circled by AFP:\n\nFootage of the California event was also uploaded to video platform Vimeo here in 2015.\n\nThe image below compares screenshots from the Vimeo footage (L) with the footage used in the misleading Facebook post (R):\n\nThe same video with a similar claim had also emerged in India, for example here, where it has been shared more than 300,000 times and viewed 11 million times in about one year since it was published by a Hindi-language Facebook page.\n\nAFP\u2019s fact-check report on the Indian social media claims about the video can be read here.", "lang": "en"}
