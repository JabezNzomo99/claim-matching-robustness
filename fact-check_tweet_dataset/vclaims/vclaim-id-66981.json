The claim is false; the image is old and shows Zimbabwean businessman Wicknell Chivayo showing off his personal shoe collection.\n\nThe photo was posted on Facebook on August 10, 2020, with the caption: \u201cPresident Museveni buys more than 100 pairs of sporty shoes that he'll be wearing as the Ugandan elections of 2021 approach, in an attempt to look trendy and connect with youthful voters.\u201d\n\nThe image in the post shows a man arranging dozens of pairs of casual shoes in neat rows.\n\nThe photo was also posted with the same, and similar, claims on Facebook here, here, here and here, and on Twitter here.\n\nAgain, the photo appeared in an article with a similar claim on Kenyan blog Bana, which publishes online news and entertainment. The headline reads: \u201cUganda president Yoweri Museveni buys more than 100 pairs of sporty shoes to lure youthful voters\u201d.\n\nThe article points to another report in Uganda\u2019s Daily Monitor where it claims that Museveni, in addition to buying sporty sneakers, had also \u201cprocured flares\u201d in order \u201cto connect with youths\u201d and win over young voters in next year\u2019s elections. Despite efforts by AFP Fact Check as well as Pesa Check in this debunk, no evidence of such a report by the Daily Monitor was found.\n\nThe claim that it is Museveni in the picture is, indeed, false.\n\nAFP Fact Check conducted a reverse image search that led to an article from October 31, 2017, published on a website called My Zimbabwe News. The headline reads: \u201cPompous Chivayo lambasted after posting photo of his shoes on social media\u201d.\n\nThe story describes the backlash against Wicknell Chivayo, a businessman from Zimbabwe, who used social media to flaunt his wealth and extensive shoe collection.\n\nAn additional search on Chivayo\u2019s Instagram account, where he goes by the name Sir Wicknell, led to a post from April 7, 2015, featuring the photo that was used in the false claim about Uganda's president.\n\nThe caption reads: \u201c... After praying I get into this dressing room, it's a headache again with more than 200 pairs of shoes which ones will I wear today, then lastly in the parking lot which car am I driving today...? \u201d.", "lang": "en"}
