An administration under Narendra Modi spent millions to develop infrastructure for monkeys in Gujarat . I don't want to start a hashtag #BandarModi, but want to add that Mani Shankar Aiyar was prophetic about his #NeechAadmi comments (sic)\u201d the tweet read.Nana Patole, president of the All India Kisan Congress shared the clip claiming \u201cModi can\u2019t differentiate between bandar and bandargaah. Before throwing mud at others, it would have been better if he looked inside.\u201dAnother Twitter user sounded convinced that Modi talked about monkeys.Pakistani journalist Marvi Sirmed opined Modi \u201cconfused port with monkey\u201d.Journalist Swati Chaturvedi too shared the clip with caption \u201cModi bandaron ka vikas karna chahte hain\u201dModi did not talk about the development of monkeys. He was talking about the development of ports, which are called \u2018bandar\u2019 in Gujarati. Case in point: Porbandar, a coastal city in Gujarat. The video from which these misleading claims have been made is an old speech Modi gave in Dwaraka city of Gujarat in 2017. His speech has been edited to give the impression that he talks about the development of monkeys.Using keywords, we found the original video of Modi on YouTube. In this video, one can see Modi using mixed Gujarati and Hindi vocabulary to communicate with those listening to him.Modi uses word \u2018bandar\u2019, \u2018bandaron\u2019 etc repeatedly during his speech. In Gujarati language , \u2018bandar\u2019 means \u2018port\u2019. Gujarat being a state with huge coastline, Modi was talking about development of ports and port-based infrastructural development.On looking for meaning of port in Gujarati, the Google translate threw up \u2018Bandara\u2019 as the top result.There is an entire Wikipedia article about it. It can be read here We also got in touch with the Times group\u2019s IamGujarat editor, who confirmed that Modi indeed was talking about ports and not monkeys.Times Fact Check has found the claims of Modi talking about the development of monkeys in his tenure to be misleading. In reality, he talks about the development of ports.", "lang": "en"}
