{"title": "FALSE: Robredo quote on 28-day quarantine", "subtitle": "Vice President Leni Robredo did not say this quote, which was perpetuated through a manipulated quote card", "author": "rappler.com", "date": "Jul 15, 2020 6:59 PM PHT", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-64499", "url": "https://rappler.com/newsbreak/fact-check/robredo-quote-28-day-quarantine", "vclaim": "Vice President Leni Robredo said if two people in one house need to undergo 14-day quarantine, it will add up to 28 days in total.\n\nAt least 5 Facebook users circulated a graphic in July 2020, which attributed this quote to Robredo: \"My policy is this \u2013 14 days quarantine sundin po natin para sa lahat ng apektado. Kung 2 [kayo] sa bahay 28 days po lahat (My policy is this \u2013 please follow 14-day quarantine for all who are affected. If there are two of you in one house, that will be 28 days in total.)\"\n\nThe photo of Robredo used in the graphic as well as the description matched a quote card posted by News5 on March 12, which contained this quote by Robredo: \"Ang bawat bote ng alkohol na iniimbak natin at di nagagamit ay isang boteng ipinagkakait natin sa ating mga kapitbahay. Sa huli, kung magkasakit sila, lahat tayo madadamay, gaano man karami ang maiimbak nating mga gamit o pagkain.\"\n\nThe quote on hoarding was taken from Robredo's speech on the same day. In this speech, she did not make any mention of a required 28-day quarantine for two co-habitants.\n\nA similar fake quote was also circulated in March 2020, as fact-checked by Vera Files, using another quote card manipulated from one posted by GMA News. The altered graphic was flagged as fake by GMA News.\n\nIn the past, the News5 quote card was used to perpetuate other fake quotes attributed to Robredo, including one falsely claiming that she said the virus should be restrained instead of people. \u2013 Loreben Tuquero/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
