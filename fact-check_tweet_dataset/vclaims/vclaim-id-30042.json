As of early Jan. 27, the estimated death toll is 81 \u2014 all of them in China.\n\nAs health officials around the world grapple with the outbreak of a respiratory illness caused by a new coronavirus that has spread from Wuhan, China, online misinformation has spread about the number of deaths related to the new virus.\n\nThe number of confirmed cases of the virus worldwide numbered 2,886 and the total confirmed deaths stood at 81 \u2014 all of them in China \u2014 as of early Jan. 27, according to data collected and mapped by Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Center for Systems Science and Engineering. The data is drawn from sources such as the World Health Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and China\u2019s National Health Commission.\n\nThe Hubei province in China, which includes Wuhan, has so far reported 76 deaths.\n\nThose figures stand in stark contrast to social media posts and online stories that have erroneously claimed the number of fatalities is actually in the thousands.\n\nThe Geller Report, a website run by anti-Islamic activist Pamela Geller, for example, published and spread a headline reading: \u201cCORONAVIRUS: Reports of 10,000 DEAD in Wuhan, China.\u201d\n\nBut the story links to one \u201cunconfirmed\u201d report that is actually just hearsay on a website about gold and metals, jsmineset.com, which has a disclaimer that says it can\u2019t vouch for the \u201caccuracy or completeness\u201d of its information.\n\nJsmineset.com published an email on Jan. 24 from someone named \u201cRobert,\u201d who wrote: \u201cI just received a call from a close American friend of mine who just got off the phone with a Chinese friend, who has relatives in Wuhan. He says there may already be ~10,000 dead there from the virus.\u201d The email offers no other evidence for the claim.\n\nLikewise, some Facebook users shared a post that claimed \u2014 without any sourcing \u2014 that the \u201cCORONAVIRUS MUCH WORSE THAN YOU\u2019RE BEING TOLD \u2013 THOUSANDS DEAD,\u201d and regurgitated the falsehood that there is an existing patent for the new coronavirus \u2014 which we\u2019ve previously debunked.\n\nCoronaviruses are a family of viruses that often cause respiratory illnesses in humans and other illnesses in animals, according to the CDC. The new coronavirus is being referred to as the 2019 novel coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV.\n\nThe U.S., to date, has five confirmed cases of the virus.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
