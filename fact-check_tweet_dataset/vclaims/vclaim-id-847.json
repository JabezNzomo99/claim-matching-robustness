A recent report by MPs in the Foreign Affairs Committee mentions NATO, the UN Security Council, the Commonwealth, the G8 group, the G20 group, the OECD, the Council of Europe and the World Trade Organisation as examples of key international bodies.\n\nThe UK is an individual member of all these organisations. The EU is also represented, in one way or another, at many of them.\n\nIts role varies. At the World Trade Organisation, the European Commission \u201cspeaks for all EU member States at almost all WTO meetings\u201d, meaning the UK doesn\u2019t represent itself independently. In others, the EU sits alongside the UK.\n\nThe EU \u201cparticipates as an equal\u201d at the G8, according to the American Council on Foreign Relations think tank. At the OECD it doesn\u2019t have voting rights, but the OECD says that \u201cthe European Commission\u2019s participation goes well beyond that of an observer\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
