His statement, from 2016, was critical of now-President Donald Trump \u2014 not of Trump\u2019s rival, Hillary Clinton.\n\nAndy Borowitz\u2019s satirical column in the New Yorker, \u201cThe Borowitz Report,\u201d uses the tagline: \u201cNot the news.\u201d\n\nA popular meme circulating on social media that purports to quote Borowitz is deserving of a similar disclaimer: \u201cNot his words.\u201d\n\nThe meme, which has surfaced on Facebook and Instagram, includes a photo of Borowitz and an erroneous quotation about \u201cstopping Hillary\u201d Clinton.\n\n\u201cStopping Hillary is a short-term solution,\u201d the bogus meme reads. \u201cThe long-term solution \u2014 and it will be more difficult \u2014 is fixing the educational system that has created so many people ignorant enough to vote for Hillary.\u201d\n\nBoth references to \u201cHillary\u201d are in red and, as it turns out, for good reason: The statement Borowitz really made wasn\u2019t about Clinton, but about her 2016 presidential campaign rival, now-President Donald Trump.\n\nBorowitz made his statement in a post to his verified Facebook page in 2016. It reads: \u201cStopping Trump is a short-term solution. The long-term solution, and it will be more difficult, is fixing the educational system that has created so many people ignorant enough to vote for Trump.\u201d\n\nBorowitz has been continuously critical of Trump.\n\nAs we have written before, misattributed quotations often circulate online, using the popularity of high-profile figures to spread political messaging.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media. Our previous stories can be found here.\n\nBorowitz, Andy. \u201cStopping Trump is a short-term solution. The long-term solution, and it will be more difficult, is fixing the educational system that has created so many people ignorant enough to vote for Trump.\u201d Facebook. 4 Nov 2016.", "lang": "en"}
