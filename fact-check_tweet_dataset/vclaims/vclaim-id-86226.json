Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), a major talking point in the 2012 presidential election. One small problem: Ryan had crafted a plan to overhaul Medicare that retained virtually all of the Medicare \u201ccuts\u201d contained in the health-care law but diverted them instead toward helping fund his plan.\n\nBut it\u2019s a misleading figure. Trump is proposing to move two parts of Medicare \u2014 payments to hospitals that treat many patients without insurance and payments to hospitals that educate medical residents \u2014 to another part of the budget. So it looks like a $269 billion \u201ccut\u201d to Medicare. But it reflects spending that would mostly continue, at an inflation-adjusted rate \u2014 just not within the Medicare system.\n\nThere may be policy reasons to oppose such a move \u2014 hospitals are fiercely opposed, because it would result in fewer funds \u2014 but you can\u2019t count it against the old baseline. So, if you want to compare apples to apples, you should subtract $269 billion from the Medicare reductions. (The minority staff of the Senate Budget Committee tries to get around this by saying the \u201cMedicare budget function\u201d would be reduced by $845 billion.)\n\nGranted, some might make the case that Obama already grabbed the low-hanging fruit and that this round of provider reductions could lead to fewer doctors being willing to see Medicare patients. That\u2019s speculative at this point, but hospital associations have vehemently protested Trump\u2019s proposals. Hospitals also would be affected by Trump\u2019s plan to dramatically reshape Medicaid, the health program for the poor, from an entitlement program into state block grants or strict per-person limits that are not affected by economic changes.\n\n\u201cThe ACA was a broader plan to expand access to coverage and improve affordability for beneficiaries while strengthening the Medicare program as a whole, as your fact checks have noted on a number of occasions,\u201d Schumer\u2019s office said in a statement. \u201cThe Trump administration and Congressional Republicans have no such plan to expand coverage or improve affordability \u2026 The Trump Administration\u2019s proposed reductions in Medicare spending aren\u2019t being reinvested into health care programs but rather are cuts that are meant to pay for the Republican tax cut.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
