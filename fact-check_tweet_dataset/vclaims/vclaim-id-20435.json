We have twice officially called on the television channel to react somehow, to apologize for the fact that there has been a real substitution of information,\u201d she said.\n\nZakharova added that the CNN report was aimed at \u201cmanipulating public opinion.\u201d \u201cI promise that we will not just drop this story as CNN would like.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear why Zakharova singled out CNN for criticism since Daqneesh\u2019s story was widely covered by international media. The timing of her comments, several weeks after the boy reappeared, may well be more to do with a scandal at CNN that culminated on June 26 with the resignation of three employees of the station who were involved in the publication of a since-retracted story connecting Anthony Scaramucci, chief executive of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential transition team, with Russia\u2019s Vnesheconombank.\n\nCNN had in fact reported on the reappearance of Daqneesh and his father, relaying his comments as originally broadcast by RT:\n\n\u201cWe were very harmed because of the gunmen and how they used things to their benefit with my child. Thank god, he was only slightly wounded. Thank god after the army advanced and retook these areas; we are now back in our homes. The situation now is very good, thank god.\"\n\nThat Daqneesh was not severely injured had already been widely covered last year by western media, including CNN, which reported in August 2016 that the boy had been discharged from hospital within two hours.\n\nNevertheless, his older brother, Ali, subsequently died from injuries sustained during the same air strike.\n\nAs Polygraph.info has previously pointed out, Russian aircraft were likely responsible for the attack that destroyed the Daqneesh family home.\n\nWhy then should CNN apologize?\n\nOmran\u2019s father\u2019s expression of support for the regime in June 2017 do not change the fact that his home was bombed and son killed. Nor does it make any difference whether he was a supporter of the ruling Baath party or the rebels at the time of the attack.\n\nIt may also be possible that his statements on Syrian state media were made under some form of coercion, as noted by The Guardian\u2019s Kareem Shaheen:\n\n\u201cIt was unclear if the family had been coerced into conducting the interview. The Syrian government has carried out similar disinformation efforts in the past, promising benefits to defectors or displaced civilians if they speak out against alleged rebel crimes.\u201d\n\nBearing this in mind, it is worth reading an interview Omran\u2019s father back in August last year, in then-rebel-controlled eastern Aleppo, published by The Telegraph:\n\nHe asked to be identified only by his nickname for fear that the Assad regime will seek revenge on a family that has become an unwitting symbol of the Syrian government\u2019s violence against its own people.\n\nAbu Ali winced as he described the seconds after the bomb tore through their flat. \u201cIt is very painful to watch your children falling in front of your eyes,\u201d he said.\n\nThe blast split the sofa into two halves and Omran fell into the space between them. It took Abu Ali several long seconds to dig himself out of the rubble but once he was free Omran was the first child he reached.\u201d\n\nOf course, these statements may, too, have been made under duress. But the chain of contradictory information regarding Omran\u2019s father\u2019s attitude towards the Syrian regime does not give Zakharova the right to demand an apology of any sort from CNN, working with what data was available to them. Nor does it remove the real reason that Omran\u2019s image became so widely circulated in the days after the airstrike - that the humanitarian situation in Aleppo, under Russian and Syrian bombardment, was truly dire.", "lang": "en"}
