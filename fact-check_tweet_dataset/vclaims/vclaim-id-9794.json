Bridge\u2019s op-ed suggested that the West \u201cmay be tempted\u201d to use the fallout from the poisoning of ex-double agent Sergei Skripal to \u201cslander Russia and push it out of lucrative [gas] markets\u201d in Europe.\n\nBridge was referencing a statement by U.S. President Trump who said during his visit to Poland in 2017 that the U.S. was ready to help Europe reduce its energy dependence on Russia.\n\n\u201cAmerica stands ready to help Poland and other European nations diversify their energy supplies so that you can never be held hostage to a single supplier,\u201d Trump then said after talks with Polish President Andrzej Duda, adding, \u201cWhenever you need energy, just give us a call.\u201d\n\nWhile experts question the ability of U.S. companies to help Europe substantially reduce its dependence on Russia for gas supplies in the medium and even long term, they agree that Bridge\u2019s assertions represent speculation unsupported by either facts or logic.\n\nAs Bridge suggests, the Soviet Union and European states had a relatively stable energy relationship during the Cold War, but this has changed since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nAccording to Jae-Seung Lee and Daniel Connolly, who researched the issue of regional energy geopolitics in the period before and after the end of the Cold War, the collapse of the Soviet Union forced changes in transnational energy distribution patterns, resulting in ownership and other disputes.\n\n\u201cIt was this kind of conflict that spilled over and affected European customers in the Ukrainian crises of 2006 and 2009. It also explains Eastern European resistance to the Nord Stream pipeline,\u201d they write.\n\nRussia and Ukraine were both locked in a series of gas disputes in 2006 and 2009 that resulted in gas supply cut-offs affecting numerous countries in Europe, raising concerns that Moscow was using its dominant position as a gas supplier to pressure Ukraine and other European countries.\n\nEdward Chow, an energy and security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Polygraph.info that Russia has, in fact, used its position as a dominant gas supplier to selectively pressure Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia.\n\nEuropean capitals thus view U.S. companies\u2019 efforts to expand their energy market share as a way to reduce their heavy dependence on gas supplies from Russia, which in 2017 accounted for 34 percent of Europe\u2019s total gas consumption.\n\nBut questions remain regarding the ability of the U.S. companies to do so in any foreseeable feature. The EU, for instance, estimates that supplies from LNG providers in the U.S., Norway, the UAE, and Russia could together meet only 25% of the EU gas consumption needs by 2030.\n\nA lack of political will compounds the problem. Pavel Molchanov, an energy analyst with Raymond James, says that politicians in Europe \u201cstill pay lip service to diversifying gas supply away from Russia,\u201d but notes that the region\u2019s reliance on gas imports from any source is actually declining. Even then, according to the estimates in \u201cthe Roadmap of the EU-Russia Energy Cooperation until 2050,\u201d Russia will remain one of Europe\u2019s major natural gas suppliers.\n\nAs part of the effort, Russia is building the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to deliver gas to the European market bypassing Ukraine, which has borne the brunt of its gas supply cut-offs.\n\nAs recently as March, Russia\u2019s Gazprom withheld the supply of $125 million worth of gas amid a dispute with Kyiv, causing a 10% gas supply shortfall for Ukraine. Garzprom also decreased pipeline pressure for gas transiting via the country to the rest of Europe.\n\nExperts say Moscow is interested in completing Nord Stream 2 to avoid gas disputes with Ukraine and position itself as a reliable supplier to the EU. But Russia may also be seeking to undermine the reliability and position of Ukraine, which has largely weaned itself off Russia\u2019s gas supplies for its own consumption but serves as a transit state for the gas bound for Europe.\n\nSuch disputes can therefore hold Russian gas supplies to Europe hostage, though Russia has not, according to Molchanov, directly targeted the EU in \u201cpolitically motivated ways.\u201d \u201c\u2026In January 2009 -- and a few other instances \u2013 Russia has sought to punish Ukraine by curtailing gas supply to Ukraine, and an indirect consequence of that was reduced gas supply to the EU. The Kremlin\u2019s target was Ukraine, but EU countries were affected as well,\u201d he says.\n\nLee and Connolly write that talking about Russia\u2019s use of its \u201cenergy weapon\u201d given the created energy dependencies can be misleading because it is \u201ca complicated and multifaceted phenomenon,\u201d as the dependencies \u201crestrict the maneuverability\u201d of parties involved when it comes to choosing \u201cmore extreme measures.\u201d\n\nYet, this co-dependency has a twist, providing more wiggle room for Russia. Chow explains: \u201cRussia is more dependent on the European gas market than Europe as a whole is dependent on Russia as gas supplier. However, Russia acts as one unit whereas Europe does not.\u201d\n\nThe suggestion that Russia has not used its dominant gas supplier position as a pressure tool does not withstand scrutiny. And the op-ed speculation about a nexus between the Skripal case and the West\u2019s alleged efforts to push Russia out of the European gas market is unsupported by facts.\n\nThe author\u2019s evidence supporting the reasoning is a European lobbyist\u2019s suggestion of the U.S. \u201cgetting tough\u201d on the Nord Stream 2 effort and the German foreign minster\u2019s suggestion that an largely unenforced U.S. sanctions law \u201caggressively\u201d combines foreign policy and economic interests.\n\nAccording to Chow, the Skripal case \u201chas absolutely nothing to do with US LNG.\"\n\n\u201cThe whole world suspects Russia in the Skripal case because it is the only one with the motivation and the means. It also fits a Russian pattern of behavior,\u201d he says.\n\nJohn Herbst, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine (2002-2006) and current director of the Atlantic Council's Dinu Patriciu Eurasia Center, says the op-ed assertions are devoid of logic. \"Problem number one with this is that Britain, which took the first steps against the Kremlin, is not a gas supplier. More important, if Western companies can supply gas more cheaply than Gazprom, they will win European contracts,\u201d he told Polygraph.info.\n\nHerbst says the op-ed statements on the alleged Skripal nexus represent a \u201cdiversion\u201d resting on \u201cincorrect ideas\u201d about the workings of the market. \u201cIt suggests that greed \u2013 something people understand \u2013 pushed the British, the Americans and twenty-five other governments to accuse the Kremlin of a bogus chemical weapons assassination attempt in the UK,\u201d he said.\n\nThe statements, he explains, also divert attention from \u201cNovichok\u201d nerve agent allegedly used to poison Skripal as well as from the UK accusation of a \u201cchemical weapons assassination\u201d of Aleksandr Litvinenko by \u201ca Russian state operative,\u201d also on the UK soil, in 2006.\n\nAccording to Geysha Gonzalez, the associate director of the Dinu Patriciu Eurasia Center, Bridge\u2019s reasoning involves \u201ca series of half-truths\u201d that ignore the instances of the Kremlin\u2019s aggression.\n\n\u201cFrom the state-sponsored doping program to the illegal annexation of Crimea, and most recently to the use of a nerve agent in a NATO country, the Kremlin has more than warranted the expulsion of its diplomats from several nations, including the U.S.,\u201d she told Polygraph.info.", "lang": "en"}
