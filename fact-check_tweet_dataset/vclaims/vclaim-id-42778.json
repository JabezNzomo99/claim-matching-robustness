The purported tweet is circulating in the backdrop of people questioning the Home Minister\u2019s low profile during the Covid-19 outbreak that continues to rage.\n\nThe text in the viral image reads, \u201cMy fellow countrymen, each step that I took was for the nation\u2019s well-being, I don\u2019t hate any person from any caste or religion. Since the past few days due to poor health I haven\u2019t been able to serve the citizens of the country, I am sad to share that I have bone cancer in the back of my throat. I hope during good months of Ramzan, Muslim community will also pray for my speedy recovery and I will be at your service soon.\u201d\n\nAlt News has received several requests to fact-check this on WhatsApp (+91 76000 11160) and on our official Android application.\n\nThe viral image of Home Minister Amit Shah\u2019s tweet is not authentic. The tweet has been manufactured and this is evident from the inconsistencies.\n\n1. Tweet is not in perfect alignment\n\nAlt News has compared the viral tweet with a screenshot of a recent tweet by Shah. In the viral tweet, the text crosses over the red line towards the left and beyond the display picture. It is not aligned.\n\nThe viral tweet has been manufactured to imitate how a tweet appears on mobile phones. The time \u201912h\u2019 appears beside the username and not on the bottom in the time-date format, meaning that the fake tweet attempts to replicate tweets that appear on the home page when they haven\u2019t been opened (clicked on).\n\nAt first glance itself, the text in the viral screenshot seems over the 280 character limit on Twitter. Alt News extracted the text from the image by saving the file and opening it in Google docs. Upon pasting the text on Twitter, we found that it has 149 extra characters.\n\nThe tweet carries more commas than required and only one full stop at the end. The entire paragraph is essentially one sentence. Furthermore, the word \u2018\u091c\u093e\u0924\u093f\u2019 (caste) has been wrongly spelt as \u2018\u091c\u093e\u0924\u0940\u2019, \u2018\u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u2019 (health) as \u2018\u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0925\u2019, \u2018\u092e\u0948\u0902\u2019 (Me) as \u2018\u092e\u0947\u0902\u2019 and \u2018\u0914\u0930 \u091c\u0932\u094d\u0926\u2019 (and soon) as \u2018\u0914\u0930\u091c\u0932\u094d\u0926\u2019.\n\nOn May 9, Amit Shah tweeted a statement in Hindi which clarified that he is \u201ccompletely fine and does not suffer from any diseases.\u201d\n\nTherefore, a fake tweet is widely circulating on social media in the name of Amit Shah. Moreover, if such a tweet was put out from the Home Minister\u2019s official account, it would not be taken down. But we were unable to find the tweet on Shah\u2019s timeline. Even if we assume that the tweet has been deleted, there would be a clarification from the Home Minister which is not the case. In March, Alt News debunked two images that claimed Shah was infected with the coronavirus.\n\n[This article was updated with Home Minister Amit Shah\u2019s tweet.]", "lang": "en"}
