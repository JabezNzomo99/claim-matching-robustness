The claim is false; fire officials in Wuhan and Chongqing, a city in Sichuan province, clarified the video in fact shows a fire ignited by a cigarette at a residential block in Chongqing; Baidu Maps' street view imagery of the address provided by authorities shows the same building seen in the video.\n\nThe video was published on Facebook here on February 7, 2020. It has been viewed more than 200 times.\n\nThe post\u2019s simplified Chinese-language caption translates to English as: \"An explosion at Jiaxingyuan on Gutian 4th Road, Wuhan, was caused by the use of air conditioner at an apartment thoroughly disinfected by alcohol. Be warned, be warned\".\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe novel coronavirus, which emerged in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province in late 2019, has killed more than 1,000 people and infected more than 42,000 others in China, AFP reported here on February 12, 2020.\n\nThe video was also shared on Facebook here, here, here and here; on Twitter here and here; and on YouTube here, here and here with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; Wuhan and Chongqing fire officals clarified the fire in fact took place in Chongqing in Sichuan province, and had no connection to the novel coronavirus.\n\nWuhan Fire Service refuted the claim in a February 7, 2020, post on its verified Weibo account, which translates to English as: \"A resident at Jiaxingyuan, Gutian 4rd Road, Wuhan, used alcohol disinfectant, which led to a fire and an explosion? Rumour debunked: The truth is the blaze took place at a building at Jiazhou Garden residential area in Chongqing around 5 pm January 1, 2020\".\n\nThe post also contains a screenshot from the misleading video with \u201crumour\u201d in red Chinese characters superimposed on it.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Weibo post:\n\nOn January 1, 2020, Chongqing Fire Service reported a fire at the same address here. In a separate Weibo post on January 20, 2020, the department said the blaze was ignited by a cigarette.\n\nTranslated to English, the January 20 post states: \"At about 16:42 January 1, 2020, a fire erupted at building A4 in Jiazhou Garden residential area, Yubei district, Chongqing city, but caused no casualties.\n\n\u201cOur investigations show the blaze started after Yang, a tenant living in unit 2-5 at building A4, accidentally set fire to a quilt while smoking. Yang subsequently placed the quilt on the balcony without completely extinguishing the fire, leaving the quilt ablaze again. Flammable objects nearby were then set alight during the full-blown fire.\"\n\nThe building on Baidu Maps at the address provided by fire officials corresponds with the tower block seen in the video in the misleading posts.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the corresponding Baidu Maps street view imagery:\n\nThe Chongqing fire was also reported here and here by Chinese state media People\u2019s Daily on January 1, 2020.", "lang": "en"}
