The Facebook post included one photo the user said was from the media, showing a modest gathering, and another one, with clear evidence of manipulation, said to be from the White House and depicting a thick crowd.\n\nThe White House doctored the image \"to make the crowd look bigger,\" the post claimed.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Trump held a fundraiser in Tampa for his re-election campaign that evening.\n\nBut it turns out the doctored image borrowed from the Twitter user was the work of a prankster trying to make a joke out of the president\u2019s sensitivities about crowd size.\n\nDespite the shoddy cut-and-paste work, some social media commenters appeared to take the allegation against the White House seriously. One Twitter user wrote:\n\n\"This should be pointed out by every major news organization in the country. It should be shown. It matters that the WH is openly engaging in this type of manipulation. I\u2019m so sick of our collective reaction being, \u2018Meh, it\u2019s Donald.\u2019\"\n\nAfter observing the reaction, the Twitter user who created the image tweeted:\n\n\"I figured that by using Paint (no Photoshop was harmed in the production) the resulting edits would be so obvious that EVERYONE would immediately recognize it as a joke, chuckle and move on. But this has been eye-opening.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s been labeled now as a joke but it should have been labeled originally because none of us know reality anymore!\"", "lang": "en"}
