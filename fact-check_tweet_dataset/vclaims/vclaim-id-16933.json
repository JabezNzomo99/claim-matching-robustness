Kennedy in Dallas. According to the Miami Herald, another man in the picture was never identified by the Warren Commission, whose investigation concluded Kennedy was assassinated by Oswald and that Oswald acted alone.\n\nThe tabloid story got legs on May 3 when Trump referenced it in an interview on \u201cFox and Friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald\u2019s being, you know, shot!\u201d Trump said. \u201cI mean, the whole thing is ridiculous. What \u2013 what is this right, prior to his being shot. And nobody even brings it up. I mean, they don\u2019t even talk about that, that was reported and nobody talks about it. But I think it\u2019s horrible, I think it\u2019s absolutely horrible, that a man can go and do that, what he\u2019s saying there.\u201d\n\nTrump later added, \u201cI mean what was he doing with Lee Harvey Oswald, shortly before the death \u2013 before the shooting? It\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\nThe Enquirer cited two photo experts to make the connection that the unidentified man \u200b\u201dcaught on camera in New Orleans \u2014 alongside Lee Harvey Oswald\u201d \u2014 was Rafael Cruz.\n\nCentral to the story was the analysis of Mitch Goldstone, president and CEO of ScanMyPhotos, a California-based digitizing photo service. He is quoted as saying, \u201cThere\u2019s more similarity than dissimilarity. \u2026 it looks to be the same person and I can say as much with a high degree of confidence.\n\nRead that carefully. He\u2019s not saying with a high degree of certainty that it\u2019s Rafael Cruz. He\u2019s saying with a high degree of certainty that it \u201clooks to be the same person.\u201d There\u2019s a difference.\n\nWe reached out to Goldstone, and he told us by phone, \u201cI stand behind those comments 100 percent.\u201d But he explained that he did not employ facial recognition technology to reach his conclusions, because the photographs are too grainy. Rather, he said, he utilized a tool called FotoForensics to authenticate that the photos had not been digitally altered.\n\nThen he compared, by eye, the photo of the unidentified man in the picture with Oswald with a passport photo of a young Rafael Cruz. Based on features like facial structure and skin texture, he concluded \u2014 using a phrase that he repeated numerous times \u2014 that there were \u201cmore similarities than dissimilarities\u201d in the appearance of the two men.\n\n\u201cI never said categorically that it is him,\u201d Goldstone told us. \u201cI said it looks to be more similar than dissimilar.\u201d\n\nGoldstone said that contrary to at least one report he saw, he was not paid by the National Enquirer for his opinion.\n\n\u201cI think anyone who would look at that would come to the same conclusion,\u201d he said.\n\nGoldstone is calling on the Cruz campaign to release all of the photos they have of Rafael Cruz from that period, because \u201cit\u2019d be really helpful\u201d in reaching a conclusive determination.\n\nThe National Enquirer story also quotes Carole Lieberman, a University of California at Los Angeles forensic psychiatrist and expert witness based in Beverly Hills, California. She also compared the photos and told the Enquirer that \u201cthey seem to match.\u201d We reached out to Lieberman as well, but did not hear back from her.\n\nRegardless, Anil Jain, a computer scientist and expert on facial recognition and biometric identification at Michigan State University, told us not to put much stock in those assessments.\n\nThe images are of a poor quality, black and white, and grainy, he said. \u201cIt would be very difficult, even for a photo expert, to extract facial attributes,\u201d he said. Any conclusion about similarities is subjective, he said.\n\nAs for the features of the people in the pictures being \u201cmore similar than dissimilar,\u201d Jain said, \u201ccompared to what?\u201d To do such a comparison, you\u2019d need to compare the image with hundreds of others to determine if they are more similar or dissimilar.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d Jain said of Goldstone\u2019s conclusion. \u201cAnyone can make that statement.\u201d\n\nIn fact, he said, Rafael Cruz\u2019s flared out ears don\u2019t seem to match those of the unidentified man in the Oswald photo. \u201cThere is no scientific basis to say the unidentified person in the Lee Harvey Oswald photo has any similarities with the Rafael Cruz picture. There is no way you can reliably extract any facial characteristics,\u201d Jain said.\n\nAnd, we would note, even if it were Rafael Cruz in the picture with Oswald, there is no evidence whatsoever that he had anything to do with the Kennedy assassination, despite a headline that claimed \u201cTed Cruz Father Linked to JFK Assassination!\u201d\n\nThe Cruz campaign has vigorously denied that the unidentified man in the photo with Oswald is Rafael Cruz. Cruz called Trump\u2019s claim \u201ckooky.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is another garbage story in a tabloid full of garbage,\u201d Communications Director Alice Stewart told McClatchy. \u201cThe story is false; that is not Rafael in the picture.\u201d The Miami Herald reported that while the elder Cruz was once a supporter of Fidel Castro, he turned away from the Cuban leader when Castro declared in 1961 that he was a Marxist.\n\nThe Herald\u2019s April 22 story also noted a McClatchy report that quoted Gus Russo, an author and journalist who has written extensively about the JFK assassination and Oswald, as saying the Enquirer report is dubious. Russo told McClatchy in an interview that Oswald, \u201cwho was living in New Orleans in 1963, was not connected to the Cuban community there and would not have had a Cuban supporter helping him,\u201d the Herald said.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to our inquiries for backup for Trump\u2019s claim.\n\nThis is not the first time the Enquirer has injected itself into the presidential campaign. A March Enquirer piece alleged multiple extramarital affairs for Cruz \u2014 an accusation that his campaign vehemently denied. Trump also landed a rare endorsement from the publication in March of this year, and has written several op-eds for the magazine. In addition to Cruz, the Enquirer has attacked many of Trump\u2019s other campaign rivals, including Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson and Hillary Clinton.\n\nDavid Pecker, the CEO of the Enquirer\u2019s parent company, American Media Inc., has been said to have a close personal relationship with Trump. New York Magazine called them \u201cfriends for years,\u201d and the New York Daily News reported that they are \u201cvery close.\u201d Trump has voiced support for Pecker in the past, endorsing him to take over Time magazine in 2013. It is worth noting that the Enquirer has also run several less-than-flattering stories on Trump in the past, especially in the 1990s before Pecker came on as CEO.", "lang": "en"}
