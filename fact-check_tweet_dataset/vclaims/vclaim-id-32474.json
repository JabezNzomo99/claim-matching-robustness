The video has been edited to add a voice-over giving a misleading description that the incident is from Kashmir.\n\nThe video is being shared after the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government on August 5 abrogated Article 370 and revoked the special status granted to Jammu and Kashmir. The state was placed under a communications lockdown and internet connectivity services shutdown.\n\nBOOM received the video with the added voice over on its helpline (7700906111) to verify the claim.\n\nThe video was also received by BOOM on its helpline number (7700906111) from a user asking for its veracity. Given the graphic nature of the video, we have decided to not include it.\n\nThe video shows a mob kicking and brutally assaulting the women while they plead with the crowd to stop.\n\nThe false claim is in the Hindi voice over which translates to, \"Assalamu alaikum dear brothers, how are you? I have received this video from Kashmir. If you don't know this, I am telling you that it is from Kashmir. You can watch with your own eyes what is happening in Kashmir. We receive such videos daily. We watch it and for two minutes we are disturbed. But this time we are going to give this to the media and make it viral so that it will even reach Imran Khan. When the Prime Minister will look at it maybe then he will show some mercy.\"\n\n\n\n(Original text in Hindi - \u0905\u0938\u094d\u0938\u0932\u093e\u092e\u0941 \u0905\u0932\u0948\u0915\u0941\u092e \u092a\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u092d\u093e\u0907\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0939\u093e\u0932 \u091a\u0932 \u0939\u0948? \u092f\u0939 \u090f\u0915 \u0935\u0940\u0921\u093f\u092f\u094b \u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u092a\u093e\u0938 \u0906\u092f\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u091c\u094b \u0915\u0936\u094d\u092e\u0940\u0930 \u0915\u0940 \u0939\u0948 | \u0915\u093f\u0938\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u092f\u0926\u093f \u0928 \u092d\u0940 \u092a\u0924\u093e \u0939\u094b \u0928 \u0924\u094b \u092e\u0948\u0902 \u092c\u0924\u093e\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0942\u0901 \u0915\u0940 \u092f\u0939 \u0935\u0940\u0921\u093f\u092f\u094b \u0915\u0936\u094d\u092e\u0940\u0930 \u0915\u0940 \u0939\u0948 | \u0915\u0936\u094d\u092e\u0940\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u091c\u094b \u0939\u094b \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0906\u092a \u0905\u092a\u0928\u0940 \u0906\u0901\u0916\u094b\u0902 \u0938\u0947 \u0926\u0947\u0916 \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0939\u094b | \u0930\u094b\u095b \u0907\u0938 \u0924\u0930\u0939 \u0915\u0940 \u0935\u0940\u0921\u093f\u092f\u094b \u0939\u092e\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u092a\u093e\u0938 \u0906\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948\u0902 | \u0939\u092e \u0930\u094b\u095b \u0926\u0947\u0916\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948 \u0914\u0930 \u0926\u094b \u092e\u093f\u0928\u091f \u092a\u0930\u0947\u0936\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u094b\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902 | \u0907\u0938 \u092c\u093e\u0930 \u0939\u092e \u0907\u0938 \u0935\u0940\u0921\u093f\u092f\u094b \u0915\u094b \u092e\u0940\u0921\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0924\u0915 \u092a\u0939\u0941\u091a\u093e\u090f\u0902\u0917\u0947 \u0914\u0930 \u0907\u092e\u0930\u093e\u0928 \u0916\u093e\u0928 \u0936\u093e\u092c \u0924\u0915 \u092d\u0940 \u091c\u093e\u0928\u0940 \u091a\u093e\u0939\u093f\u090f | \u0914\u0930 \u092f\u0939 \u0935\u095b\u0940\u0930-\u090f-\u0906\u095b\u092e \u091c\u092c \u0926\u0947\u0916\u0947\u0917\u093e \u0928 \u0907\u0938 \u0935\u0940\u0921\u093f\u092f\u094b \u0915\u094b \u0924\u094b \u0936\u093e\u092f\u0926 \u0909\u0938\u0915\u0947 \u0926\u093f\u0932 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0930\u0939\u092e \u0906 \u091c\u093e\u090f | \u092e\u0948\u0902 \u0915\u0938\u092e \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0926\u0942\u0902\u0917\u093e |\")\n\nThe same video was viral in August just days after the incident in Rohtas, Bihar that led to the arrest of hundreds of people for attacking the two women.\n\nAccording to news reports, on July 26, the victims - Sangeeta Devi and Baby Devi were accompanied by three children and asking for directions at Maliyabagh in Rohtas.
