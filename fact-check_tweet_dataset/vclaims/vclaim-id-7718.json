The Russian media, including official government outlets, extensively covered Depp\u2019s visit.\n\nSome of the reports turned out to be fabrications -- in particular, the reports that he had a car accident in S. Petersburg and private dates with 40 Russian girls in Moscow, for which the girls had to pay $1,000 each. Both reports were false, yet they crossed the Atlantic to appear in the English language media.\n\nIn the article published this past March headlined \u201cHow Did an Itty-Bitty Piece of Russian Propaganda Wind Up in Slate?,\u201d Slate Magazine looked into \u201chow and why\u201d the Russian media intentionally target popular Western personalities.\n\nThe article explained how Slate had become part of a Columbia Journalism Review study of 32 U.S. media outlets that unintentionally shared content produced by the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency (IRA).\n\nApparently, Slate unintentionally shared an embedded IRA tweet ridiculing Johnny Depp, who had caused controversy by joking about assassinating President Donald Trump. The Slate story ran in June 2017, after Trump had been elected.\n\nAt this point it is impossible to say whether the latest fabrications concerning Depp are part of the IRA campaign. However, the fact that not only Russian tabloids, but official government media took part in the defamation campaign against Johnny Depp raises questions.\n\nThe car accident was fabricated by St. Petersburg\u2019s popular Channel 5 TV. The report was based on an incident in which a van being used by the Hollywood Vampires, while exiting the hotel parking garage hit a wall without causing any damage to the vehicle or to its occupants. The incident was recorded and the video posted on Channel 5\u2019s website. This \u201cnews\u201d quickly spread through the Russian media, including some state-owned channels.\n\nLater in the day, the St. Petersburg information agency Nevskie Novosti debunked the story about the car accident. Moreover, Johnny Depp was not even in the van that the Channel 5 TV video showed.\n\nThe second fabrication found even a broader coverage and caused a wave of speculation.\n\nThe \u201cnews\u201d that Johnny Depp had private dates with 40 Russian girls who paid $1,000 each for a few minutes alone with the American star in Moscow originated with Komsomolskaya Pravda (KP.ru), Russia\u2019s oldest and most popular newspaper.\n\n\u201cJohnny Depp is a pirate not only on screen, but in life also. For the dates with Russian fans, the capricious Hollywood star demanded a thousand bucks from each of them,\u201d KP.ru said. The newspaper quoted one of Depp\u2019s fans, a businesswoman named Anastasia Niyazgulova, as its source for this information.\n\nThe tabloid newspaper Express Gazeta gave the same figure, adding that Depp\u2019s earnings from the dates totaled \u201cabout two and a half million rubles.\u201d\n\nHowever, the KP.ru source, businesswoman Anastasia Niyazgulova, debunked the information. As quoted by the Ridus.ru news agency, Niyazgulova accused Kosomolskaya Pravda of \u201ctwisting\u201d her words and taking them \u201cout of context.\u201d\n\nIn her interview with Ridus.ru, Niyazgulova said the meetings with were not private dates with Johnny Depp, but a regular meeting between fans of the Hollywood Vampires and members of the band, and that tickets were officially sold on the band\u2019s website.\n\nApparently, the meetings were part of a standard \u201cUltimate Meet & Greet Package,\u201d and this confused the Russian media and served as a basis for the fake news.\n\nBritish fans of Johnny Deep who saw photos of him from Russia said they were concerned about his well-being, calling his appearance \u201cpale and gaunt.\u201d\n\n\u200bRossiyskaya Gazeta, the official newspaper of the Russian government, said Johnny Depp was \u201clooking ill\u201d because he was \u201cexhausted\u201d after meeting with 40 Russian girls.\n\nOne bit of news that appeared false but proved to be true was that during Johnny Depp\u2019s concert in Moscow, women took off and threw their lingerie at the star, who then collected the items from the stage and tied them to his guitar.", "lang": "en"}
