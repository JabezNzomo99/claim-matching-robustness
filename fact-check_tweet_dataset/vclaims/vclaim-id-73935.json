Through this article lets fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of a couple playing in the floodwaters that entered into their home in Delhi. Fact: The video is actually from Prayagraj, the incident took place in September 2019 when Prayagraj was hit by floods. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nReverse image search led us to a news article which reported the same video. According to the article, the incident happened way back in September 2019 in Prayagraj, UP. Video reporting of this news can be seen here.
