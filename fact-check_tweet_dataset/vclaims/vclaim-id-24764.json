This is largely incorrect.\n\nThe majority of flu vaccines are injected and contain an inactive strain of the virus so cannot give the flu to the person receiving the injection or anyone they come into contact with.\n\nThe only case where this is slightly true is with nasal flu vaccines and immunocompromised people; people with severely weakened immune systems are recommended to avoid close contact with children who have received the spray, as it contains an active strain. The spray poses no risk to healthy individuals.\n\nDespite this, immunocompromised people are encouraged to get an inactive version of the vaccine.\n\nYou can read more about vaccine exposure here.", "lang": "en"}
