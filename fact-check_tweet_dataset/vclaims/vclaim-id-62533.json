The letter claimed that the worker had been \u201coverpaid your Emergency Pay in the gross amount of $461.60.\u201d Readers asked whether the letter was authentic.\n\n\n\nGrocery store workers have been deemed an essential part of the workforce during the pandemic. Their close contact with the public has also placed in them in harm\u2019s way, and some have died as a result. Kroger and other large grocery store chains have come under scrutiny for how they treat workers during the ongoing pandemic.\n\nIn March 2020, the store chain announced that workers officially diagnosed with COVID-19 could qualify for 14 days emergency sick leave. But some criticized that move as insufficient. Shortly after, Kroger announced it would expand the paid sick leave to include employees who were simply experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, or who were self-isolating to protect themselves from the illness.\n\nBut two months after these announcements, some employees reported receiving letters from Kroger stating that they were \u201coverpaid\u201d under the coronavirus emergency leave policy. Basically, that meant they had taken time off from work under the policy, but that Kroger had retroactively deemed them to have not met the qualifications to do so, according to Jonathan Williams, communications director for United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Local 400, the labor union representing the workers. It\u2019s unclear why the company deemed those employees unqualified for the pay.\n\nOne such letter was posted on social media (as pictured above), went viral, and resulted in another round of outrage directed at Kroger. A spokeswoman for Kroger confirmed to Snopes via email that the company did send letters to a \u201csmall number of associates,\u201d but that the grocery store chain would no longer be requiring those employees to pay for the sick leave taken.\n\nIn a statement, Williams said UFCW Local 400 was glad to hear that Kroger changed course on collecting what it described as overpay but added the union \u201cwill also investigate any incidents in which a member may have already paid some money back to the company to ensure they are made whole. We are pleased Kroger has come to its senses. Now they can focus their attention on extending \u2018hero pay\u2019 until this crisis is over.\u201d\n\n\u201cHero pay\u201d refers to an extra $2 an hour that had been added to Kroger employees\u2019 paychecks as a form of hazard pay associated with working during the pandemic. Kroger ended the extra pay on May 17.\n\nBecause Kroger did send letters to some employees stating they were required to return what was described as overpaid emergency pay, but changed course and stated this repayment was no longer required, we rate this claim \u201cMixture.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
