The headline reads, \"PM Announced To Shut Down Internet Services For 1 Week, To Avoid Panic In Public Through Social Media.\"\n\nSimilar graphic with the logo of ABP News has also surfaced online.\n\nOne of our community members also sent it to us on our WhatsApp fact check number asking us to verify the claim.\n\n\n\nPM Modi did not announce an internet shutdown during the lockdown.\n\nOn comparing the actual ABP Bulletin from 24 March with the title 'Coronavirus Crisis: PM Modi Puts India Under Complete Lockdown For 21 Days' with the viral graphic, several discrepancies were found.\n\nThe top band and Narendra Modi's attire are the same in both, the lower band, however, is different, both in the terms of content and layout.\n\nThe viral photo has a red band whereas the original bulletin has a yellow band with a completely different headline.\n\nOn viewing the entire broadcast, no such claims on internet shutdown could be found. PM Modi only announced that a lockdown was to be imposed.\n\nIn the case of the Aaj Tak bulletin, the actual one has a totally different layout from the viral graphic. Aaj Tak uses the \"Breaking News' band in a different format.\n\nAaj Tak bulletins display both a headline and no lower band.\n\nAlso, PM Modi's attire does not match in the two photos.\n\nIt must be noted that Aaj Tak is a Hindi news channel and therefore does not display information in English as the viral graphic showed.\n\nTherefore, internet shutdown was not announced by PM Modi and the viral graphics are fake. \n\n\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343", "lang": "en"}
