The quote seems to have first appeared in the 1950s, over 100 years after his death, and has been repeated by other political figures such as President Gerald Ford.\n\nThe quote has been so often misattributed to Jefferson that the Thomas Jefferson Encyclopedia, curated by his estate at Monticello, has an entry dedicated to this \u201cspurious quotation.\u201d\n\nNeither this quotation nor any of its variant forms has been found in the writings of Thomas Jefferson,\u201d Research Librarian Anna Berkes wrote. \u201cThis quotation was not attributed to Jefferson until relatively recently.\u201d\n\nThe phrase was common in the 1950s in newspapers and political cartoons, according to Berkes, though the first known attribution to Jefferson in print came in 2005 with \u201cThe Quote Manual\u201d by Robert G. Moscatelli.\n\nThe quote was repeated by Ford over the years. His assistant claims that Ford heard the expression from another man, Harvard McClain, at the Economic Club of Chicago. Republican Barry Goldwater also used the saying during his political career, according to author Lee Edwards.", "lang": "en"}
