The original image is from 1995 and shows the future president with his then-13-year-old daughter.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first photo of Donald and Ivanka Trump that has been manipulated in connection with Epstein. In July, we fact-checked another photo that was edited to make it look like Epstein was with the father-daughter pair.\n\nWe rate this image Pants on Fire.\n\nCorrection: The original photo is from 1995. This story previously said it was from 1990.", "lang": "en"}
