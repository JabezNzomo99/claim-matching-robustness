The image shows a packed beach with CNN\u2019s logo at the bottom and the words \"Jacksonville Beach reopens.\"\n\nThis is bogus. CNN didn\u2019t air the image or claim that it depicts Jacksonville Beach in 2020. It also wasn\u2019t taken recently, or in Florida.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe photo was manipulated to include the CNN logo. A reverse-image search shows that the photo was taken in 2013, not 2020.\n\nWhere, you ask? The mountains in the background should be the first red flag. There are no mountains in Florida.\n\nThe image also isn\u2019t even from the United States. It was captured on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on July 28, 2013, for a mass held by Pope Francis during a weeklong visit to the country. About 3 million people attended, according to news reports.\n\nDespite what recent posts on social media might say, the photo has nothing to do with CNN, Florida or beaches currently reopening in the U.S.\n\nWe rate it Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
