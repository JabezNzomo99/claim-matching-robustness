Dhiren Yadav, owner of King's Ice-Cream said, \u201cThe image has been viral in local UP WhatsApp groups for the past one week. He was not asked to chant 'Jai Shri Ram'. The ice cream seller\u2019s name is Harishankar Verma and he is a resident of Shuklaganj, Unnao. Harilal had an altercation with a local goon which resulted in a fist fight. They knew each other and the matter was solved later.\u201d\n\nWe also spoke to Awadhesh Verma, Harishankar Verma's son, who corroborated the events and rubbished any communal overtone to the incident.\n\n\"All these claims are false. My father was returning from his daily business when some local goons roughed him up and beat him up. I wanted to share the incident through WhatsApp and make people aware of the lawlessness prevalent in Gangaghat. However, someone stole the image and changed the incident completely. I have been since then getting calls from a lot of people. And I would like to clarify that I never said that my father was asked to chant 'Jai Shri Ram'.\"\n\nWe also reached out to Shuklaganj police station. Shyam Pal, station head officer, Shuklaganj, said that the matter did not reach the police station and no complaints were filed.\n\n\u201cThe incident happened in Gangaghat. It was an internal clash and we were told that it was solved later. No complaints were also filed,\u201d Pal said.", "lang": "en"}
