But here\u2019s the best possible estimate we received, as of March 27, after communications with officials in different agencies.\n\nAbout half of the money scheduled for Puerto Rico comes from the HUD grants. But virtually none of that funding has been spent yet. HUD in July said it had approved spending $1.5 billion but the funds had not been drawn down yet, according to a Government Accountability Office report released this month. About 50 percent has been earmarked for home repair and reconstruction.\n\nA HUD official said Puerto Rico has the $1.5 billion in hand, but has spent just $42,000. \u201cIt should take Puerto Rico approximately two to three years to spend the $1.5 billion,\u201d the official said. \u201cFollowing Superstorm Sandy, the state of New Jersey disbursed $1 billion over the course of two years.\u201d\n\nIn other words, depending on how you do the math, only about a quarter of the total pot of money has actually been spent on the island \u2014 $11.2 billion.\n\nOfficials told The Fact Checker that the president was referring to an internal Office of Management and Budget estimate of the potential liabilities over the life of the disaster that would need to be committed under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1988. The estimate was described as a high-end estimate subject to change year by year.\n\nNotice that we said the additional $50 billion was \u201cover the life of a disaster.\u201d That means it\u2019s a long-term figure, beyond the traditional 10-year budget horizon. Indeed, one congressional aide estimated that Stafford payments will continue for 20 years in Puerto Rico. The government is still paying for the damage from Hurricane Katrina almost 14 years after it struck New Orleans.\n\nWithout a direct, verified quote, we cannot evaluate the accuracy of the president\u2019s statement. His remarks were interpreted by senators as money already committed or spent. But administration officials said he was talking about future liabilities, especially in relative terms to other recent disasters.\n\nThe president sometimes speaks about future spending as if it\u2019s already taken place. But if he\u2019s comparing various Stafford estimates, it could be reasonable to use 20-year figures as long as he indicated that this did not reflect current obligations.\n\nUpdate: On March 28, Trump put it this way in remarks to reporters: \u201cWe have $91 billion going to Puerto Rico. We have $29 billion to Texas and $12 billion to Florida for the hurricanes.\u201d He did not indicate that he was talking about long-term, 20-year estimates.", "lang": "en"}
