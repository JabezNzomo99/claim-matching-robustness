Michigan has not taken any formal regulatory action to restrict access.\n\nThe post, which features photos of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, alleges the bans include \u201cthreatening the licenses of doctors and pharmacist.\u201d It has been shared nearly 450 times to date.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and others have touted hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment for the disease caused by the new coronavirus. The drug, officially approved for treating malaria and some autoimmune diseases, can have potentially serious side effects, with some coronavirus patients developing heart issues while taking it, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe governors of New York, Nevada and Michigan have not banned the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 patients, however.

Five days later he amended the order to allow doctors to prescribe the drug for \u201cpatients in inpatient settings and acute settings; for residents in a subacute part of a skilled nursing facility; or as part of a study approved by an Institutional Review Board.\u201d\n\nSisolak signed on March 24 an emergency regulation that prohibits doctors in outpatient settings from prescribing and dispensing hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for COVID-19 treatment and limits prescriptions to 30-day supplies to prevent stockpiling, per the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The regulation does not apply to doctors who order the drugs for COVID-19 treatment in an inpatient setting, according to CNN.\n\nWhiter\u2019s administration has not taken any formal action to restrict access to hydroxychloroquine. On March 24, the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA) sent a letter to \u201clicensed prescribers and dispensers\u201d that warned them against prescribing the drug \u201cwithout a legitimate medical purpose.\u201d The letter did not mention any regulatory action related to hydroxychloroquine access.\n\nDavid Harns, interim communications director at LARA, confirmed to The Associated Press that the drug is not banned in Michigan, saying, \u201cLARA recognizes the ability of prescribers to make proper clinical decisions regarding these drugs, including the need to follow responsible prescribing practices to combat drug hoarding and to prevent unnecessary shortages.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
