Some of them have more than one.\n\nNewspapers across the country also have done memorial features on the victims.\n\nBut a website that posts conspiracy theories recently suggested that there were no obituaries for the victims of the shooting in a story headlined, \u201cFlorida Obituaries show no Parkland school shooting deaths.\u201d\n\nThe site, called Fellowship of the Minds, has been spreading conspiracy theories since 2013 about such tragedies as the Sandy Hook school shooting and the Boston Marathon bombing. We recently wrote about another false story on the website that claimed the \u201cMarch for Our Lives\u201d rally was planned months in advance \u2014 it wasn\u2019t.\n\nThe story on the Parkland obituaries has been copied by several other websites and posted to Facebook, where users flagged it as potentially false. It leaves the false impression that there were no deaths.\n\nThe story is based on the results of a search on the obituary website Tributes.com.\n\nIt\u2019s true that obituaries for the victims of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, don\u2019t show up in a search on that site. But it\u2019s not true that the victims don\u2019t have obituaries at all.\n\nHere is a list of all 17 who died with their ages and links to their obituaries on the website of Parkland\u2019s local newspaper, the Sun-Sentinel. Some also have obituaries posted on the website of the funeral home that handled their services:\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.", "lang": "en"}
