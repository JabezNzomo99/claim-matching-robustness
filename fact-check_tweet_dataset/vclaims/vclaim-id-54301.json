The Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) and the Tuscaloosa mayor\u2019s office refuted the claim.\n\nSocial media platforms have become replete with misinformation related to COVID-19 testing during the coronavirus pandemic. This particular post claims unused COVID-19 tests that already showed positive results were recently found in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.\n\n\u201cPLANdemic!! In Tuscaloosa, a load of Covid test kits were found to test positive before they were ever used,\u201d reads the post, which has been shared over 13,000 times. \u201cThe health department, fire department & local CDC came & examined all the kits. They found positive results on all unused kits.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no evidence such a thing happened. Had unused COVID-19 tests that already showed positive results been found there, it likely would have been picked up by news outlets, yet none have reported on it.\n\n\u201cThe Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) does not have any information related to any SARSCoV 2 kits that were found to be positive without tests performed,\u201d Dr. Karen Landers, an ADPH medical officer, told the Daily Caller in an email. \u201cADPH has not been asked and did not participate in any activity related to this Facebook post.\u201d\n\nRichard Rush, the communications director for the Tuscaloosa mayor\u2019s office, said in a phone call with the Caller that the mayor\u2019s office had not heard anything to substantiate the Facebook post\u2019s claim.

Mayor Walt Maddox said over 500 samples from the city could not be processed because of issues that included a lack of proper identification of the individuals tested, improper storage and insufficient material to run the tests, according to the Montgomery Advertiser.\n\nAs of press time, Alabama has reported over 70,400 confirmed COVID-19 cases and some 1,300 confirmed deaths, according to data from the ADPH.", "lang": "en"}
