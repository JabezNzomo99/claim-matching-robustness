Variations of the quote have appeared in print since at least 1951.\n\nTocqueville, a 19th century French author and political scientist, is best known for his two-volume work \u201cDemocracy in America,\u201d in which he recounts the nine months he spent traveling and observing the U.S.\n\nHowever, the Daily Caller found no record of the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post in \u201cDemocracy in America,\u201d or any of his other written works.\n\n\u201cNothing like this appears in \u2018Democracy in America,'\u201d Robert Tracy McKenzie, a history professor at Wheaton College, told the Caller in an email.\n\n\u201cThe sentiment contained in the quote you refer to sounds like nothing Tocqueville would have argued,\u201d added McKenzie. \u201cThe entire thrust of volume I is concerned not with how the government might corrupt the people, but the ways in which popular pressure may corrupt democratic government and render it simply an instrument for the \u2018tyranny of the majority.'\u201d\n\nAn internet search revealed that it may actually be a variation of a statement frequently misattributed to Scottish academic and author Alexander Fraser Tytler. He is credited with saying, \u201cA democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury.\u201d\n\nThis expression also seems to be spurious, according to \u201cYale Book of Quotations\u201d editor Fred Shapiro.\n\n\u201cIn The Yale Book of Quotations, for which I tried to trace all famous quotations to their accurate origins, the earliest version I found for this passage was in the New York Times Book Review, May 3, 1959,\u201d wrote Shapiro in a 2009 blog post. \u201cAnd the earliest attribution to Alexander Fraser Tytler I found was in Martin Dies, The Martin Dies Story (1963).\u201d\n\nShapiro later found an earlier instance of the longer quote, which is also often attributed to Tocqueville, in a 1951 edition of the Daily Oklahoman newspaper.", "lang": "en"}
