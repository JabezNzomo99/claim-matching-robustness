The survey data was misinterpreted by ICTU. 1 in 10 of those surveyed experience physical abuse at least once weekly.\n\nAre one in five school staff assaulted once a week?\n\nA headline in the Belfast News Letter of 21 March 2019 states \u201cOne in five school staff assaulted once a week in Northern Ireland\u201d (sic). The newspaper reported the findings of a survey of education workers by the Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Committee of Trade Unions (ICTU) Education Group.\n\nDuring October 2018, 1,427 members of the ten trade unions affiliated with ICTU were surveyed: 1,133 teaching union members and 294 members of support staff unions.\n\nICTU\u2019s press release states that \u201c1 on 5 receive physical abuse ONCE a WEEK\u201d (sic).\n\nThe press statement quotes Denise Walker, the Chair of the Education Group:\n\n\u201cIf you work in one of Northern Ireland\u2019s schools in a support role you could be one of the 51% who have been subjected to a physical incident at work. 43% of whom reported having been a victim of physical violence weekly\u201d.\n\n43% of the 728 who responded as being subject to any physical incident would indeed mean that 22% of all surveyed members (1,427 respondents) experience violence or physical abuse weekly.\n\nHowever, the document presenting the survey results reveals different figures. 46.4% of respondents (665 out of 1,427) had experienced any violence or physical abuse, rather than Walker\u2019s press release figure of 51%. And out of the 665 respondents who had experienced any violence or physical abuse, the document reports that 21.6% of them (instead of the 43% figure quoted in the press release) said that they are experiencing such abuse at least once a week.\n\nThese full results reveal that 10% of those surveyed (144 out of 1,427) are experiencing violence or physical abuse on a weekly basis. The \u201c1 in 5\u201d claim only refers to people who had ever experienced such abuse.\n\nThe results also show that 53.6% of school staff surveyed have never experienced violence or physical abuse.\n\nThe ICTU inaccurately presented the findings of its education workers survey in their press release. As a consequence, it was misreported by the Belfast News Letter. The survey found that 1 in 10, rather than the claimed 1 in 5, of education workers experience physical abuse at least once a week.\n\nImage: Photo by Alexander RATHS used by license Dreamstime.com\n\nFactCheckNI is Northern Ireland\u2019s first and only dedicated independent fact-checking service and a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network\u2019s Code of Principles.
