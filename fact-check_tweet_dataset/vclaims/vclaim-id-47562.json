The claim appears to have originated on a satirical news website.\n\nPelosi has been a popular target for viral misinformation and fabricated quotes on social media in recent weeks, with this particular Facebook post claiming the House speaker said, \u201cSocial Security recipients are just a burden on society.\u201d (RELATED: Did Nancy Pelosi Announce A 2-Month Suspension Of Social Security Starting In April?)\n\nThere is, however, no evidence Pelosi ever made the statement. A search of her social media accounts and congressional websites didn\u2019t turn up any matches. Had she made such a comment, it would have been picked up by major media outlets, yet none have reported on it, except to debunk the remark.\n\nThe quote appears to derive from a similar quote on Bustatroll.com, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes \u201cparody, satire, and tomfoolery.\u201d That website states in a fictional story that Pelosi made a very similar comment while \u201cat a recent $5000-a-plate fundraising event for orphaned San Francisco lemurs.\u201d\n\nDespite the disclaimer of the website\u2019s satirical content, multiple Facebook users have continued to share the fake quote as if it was true.", "lang": "en"}
