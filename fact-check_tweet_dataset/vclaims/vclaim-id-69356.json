More than a dozen bills introduced by Stewart-Cousins and other Democrats would allow automatic voter registration and early voting among other changes.\n\nIs voter turnout really as bad in New York state as Stewart-Cousins said?\n\nIn the November 2016 election, New York state had the eighth-worst voter turnout among states, when 57.2 percent of voting-age citizens went to the polls, according to U.S. Census Bureau figures.\n\nBefore 2016, New York state has ranked in the bottom half of states for voter turnout in all but one election during the last two decades, according to the census figures.\n\nThe state ranked 29th in voter turnout among states in the 1996 presidential election. Some years have been better than others, but the state\u2019s turnout has mostly declined since then.\n\u2022 2000: New York state ranked 35th in voter turnout at 59 percent.\n\u2022 2004: The state ranked 42nd, but the turnout rate increased that year to 60.2 percent.\n\u2022 2008: Turnout dropped to 58.8 percent. The state ranked 43rd that year.\n\u2022 2012: The state ranked 39th with a turnout rate of 58.7 percent.\n\nThe state has also ranked poorly in most non-presidential election years, when turnout is generally lower in all states.\n\u2022 1998: New York state ranked 23rd among states, its best ranking in the past two decades with a turnout rate of 48.2 percent.\n\u2022 2002: The ranking went down to 39th with a turnout rate of 43.6 percent.\n\nExcept for 2014, the state\u2019s voter turnout rate has not varied much between four-year periods.\n\nRates for other low-turnout states have shifted New York state\u2019s ranking each year. Turnout in Georgia, for example, has increased from about 51 percent in 1996 to 60 percent in 2016.\n\nElection data experts also rank New York state near the bottom of states for voter turnout.\n\nThe United States Election Project, with election numbers dating back to 1980, ranked New York state 14th lowest in voter turnout in 2016.\n\nThe project uses different methodology than the Census Bureau to calculate turnout, according to Dr. Michael McDonald, the University of Florida professor who created and manages its database.\n\nThe Census Bureau tracks turnout rates based on self-reporting from people in each state. McDonald, instead, uses the total population of eligible voters in each state drawn from administrative records. He then compares that population with the number of votes for the highest office on the ballot each year.\n\nNew York state ranked in the bottom 10 states for voter turnout in all but two elections over the last decade, according to McDonald\u2019s numbers.\n\nStewart-Cousins said \"New York consistently ranks as one of the worst voting turnout states in the nation.\"\n\nVoter turnout rates reported by the U.S. Census Bureau and McDonald confirm that claim. New York state has ranked near the bottom of states for voter turnout in most elections over the last few decades.", "lang": "en"}
