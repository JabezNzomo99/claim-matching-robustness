Sometimes they made false claims about the false claims made by each other.\n\nThat said, the Treasury didn\u2019t predict that house prices would fall by 10%, immediately after the UK voted to leave the EU.\n\nThe Treasury did say something that sounded similar. It expected house prices to be 10-18% lower than it would have otherwise expected at the end of 2017/18.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t a 10-18% fall from what they were on June 23rd 2016, it was a 10-18% fall compared to what they would have been, in the parrallel universe where the UK voted to remain in the EU.\n\nTo be fair to the audience member, many news outlets didn\u2019t spell out the difference clearly. Nor did Mr Osborne, then Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to spell out the difference between the debate about the short term economic consequences of voting to leave the EU, which created lots of uncertainties, and the long term economic effects of actually leaving the EU and trading under different rules.\n\nJust because the Treasury\u2019s expectations about the immediate impact of a vote to leave were wrong, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that its long term expectations about different trading arrangements are automatically wrong.\n\nBut economic forecasts should always be taken with a pinch of salt.\n\nAnd there\u2019ll always be a debate about just how \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019 the pre-referendum forecasts turn out to be. We\u2019ll never know exactly what would have happened if the referendum result had gone the other way.\n\nThe Treasury based its expectations on some key things that didn\u2019t happen. Among other things, it appeared to assume the government would trigger Article 50 straight away, as David Cameron had indicated, and that the Bank of England would keep interest rates the same, which it didn\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s a similar story with the \u2018Brexit budget\u2019 presented by George Osborne, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Alistair Darling, a former Chancellor, which the audience member on BBC Question Time referred to as the \u2018punishment budget\u2019.\n\nThat was a 7-page pamphlet which republished some of the economic forecasts and gave rough, hypothetical figures for the kinds of cuts which a future government could make\u2014assuming it still wanted to run a balanced budget in 2020/21.\n\nPeople will disagree on whether that was a believable assumption at the time. The government hasn\u2019t stuck to its aim for a balanced budget, and now plans to run a deficit in 2020/21.", "lang": "en"}
