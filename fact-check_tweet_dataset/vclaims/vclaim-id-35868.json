This is false; her office has denied it, and the claim apparently originated on a satirical website.\n\nAccording to the article, Pelosi violated a federal law that requires the speaker to preserve every speech \u201cgiven before Congress\u201d for the National Archives, and will have to pay a $40,000 fine.\n\nPelosi\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, told AFP by email that Pelosi had not been charged or financially punished for her actions.\n\nWhen contacted by AFP, the Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nThe original post, from a subsidiary of satire group America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, is clearly labeled as parody, but the popular copycat version is not. Accordingly, many Facebook users have shared the article believing it to be true.\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration -- which retains historical records for Congress -- said it expected the White House to send Trump\u2019s version of the speech to them. The document that Pelosi tore up was a copy of the president\u2019s remarks.\n\nCountering the claim that the speaker had breached record-keeping rules by destroying the document, a spokeswoman for the National Archives suggested there was no requirement to submit a copy to the agency.\n\n\u201cThe rules governing those records are not determined by federal laws or overseen by NARA, but rather by each Chamber\u2019s agreed upon rules,\u201d said an emailed statement.\n\nRegardless, Representative Matt Gaetz, a Republican from Florida, sought legal action when he filed an ethics complaint against Pelosi on February 5.\n\nHis complaint urged the House Committee on Ethics to request a criminal referral for Pelosi\u2019s \u201cpotential violation\u201d of 18 US Code section 2071, which bans \u201cwillfully\u201d destroying records filed in a public office.\n\nSeveral versions of Gaetz\u2019s accusations have spread on social media, including this tweet with more than 8,000 retweets.\n\nA.J. Kramer, a federal public defender who has previously litigated on this statute, called the claim \u201ca bunch of nonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I understand it, that was a copy of the speech. It wasn\u2019t filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States,\u201d Kramer said.\n\nPelosi ripping up her personal copy \u201cwouldn\u2019t come even close to violating the statute,\u201d Kramer said.\n\n\u201cThere was no violation,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump himself retweeted a misleading video that included footage of Pelosi ripping up her copy of the February 4 remarks several times after key moments of the speech. In fact, she did so only at the end.\n\nThe more than five-minute video -- originally posted by the president's director of social media, Dan Scavino -- implies that in ripping up the speech, Pelosi was criticizing the people Trump spoke of and honored in his remarks.\n\nPelosi has meanwhile accused Trump of using \u201cthe Congress of the United States as the backdrop for a reality show,\u201d and said that she \u201ctore up a manifesto of mistruths.\u201d\n\nTrump is also in the habit of tearing up official documents, POLITICO reported in 2018. But since the Presidential Records Act requires that the White House preserve all documents that pass through Trump\u2019s hands, his staff often has to tape the pieces back together to make sure the president did not break the law.", "lang": "en"}
