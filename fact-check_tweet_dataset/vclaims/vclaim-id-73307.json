The claim circulated as governments around the world recommended temperature checks as part of efforts to fight the spread of the novel coronavirus. The claim is false; health authorities have said infrared thermometers can safely be pointed at a person's head; the image in the misleading posts has been taken from a photo gallery which also shows officials in Saudi Arabia pointing infrared thermometers at people's heads.\n\nThe image was published here on Facebook on July 24, 2020.\n\nThe Malaysian-language caption translates to English as: \u201cIn Medina and Mecca, they don\u2019t \u2018shoot\u2019 temperature on the head but on the hand is also allowed!\n\n\u201cBecause it is feared the brain can be affected if it is \u2018always shot on\u2019 by laser. Avoid being shot!\u201d\n\nThe image was also repeated alongside the same claim here, here and here on Facebook.\n\nThe claim, however, is false. Health authorities say infrared thermometers are safe.\n\nThe Malaysian Ministry of Health (KKM) retweeted a thread by a local doctor, Muhamad Shazwan Sazali, commenting on a viral video advocating a similar misleading claim.\n\nThe ministry\u2019s Malaysian-language tweet translates to English as: \u201cInfrared Thermometers are safe and do not cause cancer.\u201d\n\nDr Shazwan\u2019s tweet reads in part: \u201cInfrared thermometers cause cancer? I don\u2019t know who made this video, but this is clearly not accurate.\u201d\n\nIn this press release on August 3, 2020, Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah, Malaysia\u2019s director general of health, said: \u201cNon-contact infrared thermometers are not a shooting tool and do not emit radiation. It is designed to detect and absorb the infrared light signals from the surface of the skin and convert it to electricity signals. The electronic circuit in this thermometer processes these electrical signals to determine the human body\u2019s temperature being measured and show it on the display screen. Since the infrared thermometer does not emit dangerous radiation, it is safe to use.\u201d\n\nIn this August 4, 2020 post on Facebook, Dr Ahmad Firdaus Mohd Haris, a medical doctor and co-founder of Medical Mythbusters Malaysia, wrote that the non-contact infrared thermometers \u201conly have sensors that detect temperature on the surface of the body\u201d and that temperatures are taken from the forehead because it is \u201cmore accurate\u201d compared to other parts of the body.\n\nIn a Facebook post dated July 25, 2020, here, the National Metrology Institute of Malaysia also explained that infrared thermometers are safe.\n\nThey wrote: \u201cEvery object with a temperature of over 0 Kelvin (-273 degrees Celsius) will produce infrared spectrum or ray. Infrared thermometers will detect this infrared ray or spectrum on wavelengths between 8-14 micrometers and convert it to a temperature reading \u2026 No laser rays are involved for the human body\u2019s temperature range.\u201d\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration states here that thermometer guns \u201cmay reduce the risk of spreading disease between people.\"\n\nA reverse image search on Google found the image featured in the misleading posts previously appeared in this photo gallery published by Iran\u2019s Mizan Online News Agency on July 22, 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo on Mizan\u2019s website \u2013 AFP has circled the relevant photo in red:\n\nThe first sentence of the gallery\u2019s Persian-language sub-headline translates to English as: \u201cEvery year, before the start of the hajj, the curtain of the Kaaba is lifted and white linen cloths are placed around the Kaaba.\u201d\n\nKaaba, considered by the most sacred spot for Muslims, is a shrine located near the centre of the Great Mosque in the Saudi city of Mecca.\n\nAnother photo in the photo gallery shows a guard aiming the infrared thermometer at a man\u2019s forehead, as shown below:\n\nAFP Fact Check has also debunked a similar false claim about thermometer guns causing brain damage here, and killing neurons here in Spanish.", "lang": "en"}
