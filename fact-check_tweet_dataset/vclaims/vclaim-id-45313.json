It has been suggested that the images come from last weekend\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests in the UK.\n\nHowever, half of the six pictures shown in the composite weren\u2019t taken at those protests. The image of a police medic with a cut under his eye was taken at a protest in support of Tommy Robinson in London on 9 June 2018. The image of a police officer with blood on her cheek was taken at a protest in London on 9 April 2016 against David Cameron.\n\nThe image of a police officer sat on the ground was taken at a far-right protest in Liverpool on 27 February 2016. You can see the officer from another angle here.\n\nThe other three images were from the Black Lives Matter protests in London on 7 June. The picture of the officer with the head injury was taken at the protest and can be seen later in photographs here and here.\n\nThe other two images are of the same officer. One shows the officer lying on the ground, and the other of her being dragged from the road. These were taken after a widely reported incident where a mounted police officer fell from her horse. The Metropolitan Police has said it will be investigating the circumstances.", "lang": "en"}
