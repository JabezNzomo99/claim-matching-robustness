The only election should be for President.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence of Trump saying this, on cable television or anywhere else. A representative for the Trump Organization said the quote is fake.\n\nWhile Trump and his siblings have frequently appeared on the cable news networks during their father\u2019s presidency, this quote does not reflect the comments of Trump, in November or at any other time.\n\nThe Daily Caller found no evidence of him making this remark, which would have likely been covered by news outlets, especially during a contentious midterm election cycle.\n\n\u201cThat quote is absolutely fake,\u201d Kimberly Benza, executive assistant to Trump, told the Caller in an email.\n\nFurthermore, the assertion that the country\u2019s founders meant for the president to appoint governors, senators, et cetera, defies the process laid out in the Constitution.\n\nTrump did appear on Fox Business on the date noted in the meme, but he discussed his father\u2019s record and the electoral prospects of Republicans ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.\n\n\u201cAssuming Republicans get out, assuming Trump supporters get out, and they vote for the Republican ticket, we\u2019re going to have an amazing night tomorrow,\u201d Trump said of the impending elections, in which the Democrats took the House and the Republicans kept the Senate.", "lang": "en"}
