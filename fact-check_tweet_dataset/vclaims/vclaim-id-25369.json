It may actually come from a 1926 list of library slogans.\n\nFuller, a prominent early feminist writer and editor, wrote the book \u201cWoman in the Nineteenth Century,\u201d which is considered to be an important work in the American feminist movement.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation searched for the quote in that book, as well as her other works, including letters, poems and memoirs, but found no matching or similar phrases.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not familiar with that in her writings, and, as usual, the internet is confused!\u201d said Chris Highland, author of \u201cMeditations of Margaret Fuller,\u201d in an email to TheDCNF.\n\nWe consulted with members of the Margaret Fuller Society, who didn\u2019t recognize the expression either, with board member Megan Marshall adding in an email to TheDCNF, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like the language of her day.\u201d\n\nQuote Investigator, a website dedicating to researching quotes, traced the saying to a 1926 report published in a journal called \u201cThe Library,\u201d though elements of the expression appeared earlier. According to the site, the report contained 43 library slogans written for a classroom exercise, with the alleged Fuller quote attributed to a student named W. Fusselman.\n\nThe close alphabetical proximity of the names \u201cFusselman\u201d and \u201cFuller\u201d in a collection of quotations may have caused the misattribution, Quote Investigator speculated.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
