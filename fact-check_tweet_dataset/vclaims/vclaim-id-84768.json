In the past, Pandey has been falsely identified as DCP Vikram Singh of Delhi and Sachin Pilot's father-in-law. BOOM debunked the same video in April when Republic Bharat misreported it. We had earlier fact checked the fictitious character by the same name Anil Upadhyay, who was 'created' to spread misinformation on multiple occasions irrespective of any political party, during the general elections.", "lang": "en"}
