Gilani is currently serving as the chairman of the Central Film Censor Board in Pakistan.\n\nFollowing the reply Gilani deleted his original tweet and acknowledged the statement being wrongly attributed to Lockheed Martin.\n\nHowever, he refused to budge from his stand regarding the Government of India\u2019s \u2018failure to prove\u2019 that it downed an F-16 of PAF.\n\nThe article by World News Observer (WN Observer ) titled \u2018India to face another loss: F-16 manufacturer to file law suit against false Indian claims\u2019 fabricated a series of claims that Lockheed Martin had 'expressed its annoyance over the factually incorrect statement by Indian Foreign Office spokesperson regarding alleged shooting down Pakistan\u2019s F-16 by IAF on February 27, 2019. '\n\nThe story authored by one Zubair Yaqoob claimed Lockheed Martin claimed all F-16s Pakistani inventory were well counted for and that the story was \"concocted for political gains\" by the Indian government at the cost of the reputation of the F-16s fighter jets globally.\n\nThe archived link of the article can be viewed here.\n\nWN Observer had earlier spread fake news claiming Western Command Air Marshal Chandrashekharan Hari Kumar was sacked when in fact he retired on March 1, 2019 after a distinguished career spanning over 39 years.\n\nWN Observer claims to be a news media platform and was founded in 2018, according to its Facebook page.\n\nPakistan and India are in a war of words regarding the reported downing of an F-16 jet of PAF. While Pakistan has vehemently denied such claims by its neighbour, India, however, in a press conference on February 28, produced remains of AMRAAM missile found in F-16 jets.", "lang": "en"}
