So from 1980 to 2012, that\u2019s the latest year for which we have data, the 90 percent, everybody outside the 10 percent, do you know how much they got? They got zero percent of income growth; 100 percent of income growth \u2014 GDP kept going up \u2014 100 percent of income growth went to the top 10 percent in America.\u201d\n\nThis is a very interesting but highly technical issue. Warren pitches it in a fairly partisan manner \u2014 everything turned south after \u201ctrickle-down economics\u201d (i.e., President Ronald Reagan) was introduced. She also offers somewhat simplistic reasons (such as the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission) for the shift in income growth, though her staff says she was not intending to exclude other factors.\n\nBut there are limitations. Social Security and unemployment benefits are not counted. Neither are government transfer payments, such as food stamps or veterans benefits. The data also does not include noncash items, such as employer-provided health insurance. Lastly, the impact of income and payroll taxes are not part of the calculations, even though the rich pay most of the taxes \u2014 and some lower-income workers actually receive payments such as the Earned Income Tax Credit that offset all of their federal payroll and income taxes.\n\nThere is a bit of an irony here. By focusing on wage income, Warren is not counting the impact of programs often celebrated by Democrats as success stories. Indeed, the official poverty rate also does not count the impact of those programs, which is why the Census Bureau in recent years has developed an alternative version that does include such impacts.\n\n\u201cThe great advantage of tax record data is that it goes back to 1913,\u201d Burkhauser said. \u201cThat is what is so special about the Saez numbers. But they can easily be misused by those who confuse the market income to tax units with the full after-tax income of households. Elizabeth Warren is one of those people.\u201d\n\nIn a more recent paper, Burkhauser and his colleagues concluded that during the Great Recession, government tax and transfer programs dramatically cushioned the decline in market income of the middle and bottom part of the income distribution. \u201cWhen you measure properly the role of government, you get the fullest measure of income distribution,\u201d he said. \u201cGovernment is doing its job. That\u2019s the story. I don\u2019t understand why the liberals don\u2019t celebrate this.\u201d\n\nSaez acknowledged that limitations of his data and said he and Piketty are trying to improve it. \u201cBoth pre-tax and post-tax are interesting precisely to assess how government programs help,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to produce both in the (hopefully) near future. There\u2019s no doubt that the government softened the blow of the Great Recession by running big deficits.\u201d\n\nBut then \u201c1973 marks the end of the fast growth of middle class incomes. In the late 1970s neither the middle nor the top did well. After 1980, the top does extremely well while the middle grows slowly. Like Warren, I do believe the drastic changes of the Reagan administration (financial deregulation, weakening unions, end of the very progressive top tax rates) played a key role in the unequal distribution of economic growth we\u2019ve seen since the early 1980s.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
