The article also said\n\nthere is a fort in Pakistan that looks exactly like the Mehrangarh Fort.\n\nIndia Today Fact Check found that it is the Derawar Fort in Bahawalpur district of Pakistan's Punjab which resembles the Kishangarh Fort in Jaisalmer, and not the Mehrangarh Fort.\n\nThe claims about the Mehrangarh Fort made by Amar Ujala as well as Dainik Bhaskar in the past are false.\n\nAlso read| Fact Check: No, these rail coaches are not manufactured under Make In India\n\nAlso read| Fact Check: Amit Shah's claim about Opposition leaders not raising patriotic slogans incorrect", "lang": "en"}
