The story provides no evidence and repeats the same story posted by the satirical fake news website Reagan was Right, adding in a screenshot of Fox News\u2019 Lou Dobbs.\n\nSeveral fake stories during the past couple of years have alleged voter fraud to the benefit of Democrats or involving undocumented immigrants following an election cycle in which Donald Trump repeatedly made ridiculous statements about voter fraud. After being sworn into office, Trump continued to falsely claim substantial evidence of voter fraud. Voter fraud does happen, but not to the widespread amount that Trump has alleged.\n\nThe Politico News story said that voting machines in 11 states have been declared \"compromised\" as a result of a software glitch \u2014 and as a result, the story says, \"17 elections involving ballot referendums for free entitlements for immigrants, legalized marijuana and decriminalizing heroin overdoses should be overturned.\"\n\nThe story said that the company that owns the machines, Novus Ordo Seclorum, INC, is owned by a group of Democrats including George Soros, Chelsea Clinton, Barack and Michelle Obama, and the estate of John Kennedy.\n\nAccording to LinkedIn, Novus Ordo Seclorum was a Delaware consulting firm formed in 2010 to help identify strengths and weaknesses in businesses. Its profile makes no mention of voting machines. It\u2019s unclear if the company still exists; the website was a dead link and the voicemail for the phone number was full.\n\nNot surprisingly for a made-up story, we found no evidence that the company is owned by the high-profile Democrats it mentioned.\n\nBrenda Bowser Soder, U.S. Election Assistance Commission spokeswoman, told PolitiFact that Novus Ordo Seclorum doesn\u2019t make voting machines and that the story is inaccurate.\n\nThere is no evidence that 4 million Democratic votes were \"just declared fraudulent.\" We rate this story Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
