The video spawned rumours that foreign nationals were going around local schools, kidnapping children. But officials have dismissed the rumours as \u201cfake news\u201d, saying no such abductions were reported. The traffic warden seen in the video has since been suspended from her job for her role in the panic.\n\nThe video was widely shared across various social media platforms -- we\u2019ve archived one of the Facebook posts, viewed more than 20,000 times, here.\n\n\u201cSchools are out all around Thokoza and Katlehong,\u201d reads the caption on the September 4 post, referring to two townships in the Ekurhuleni municipality east of Johannesburg.\n\nThe caption continues: \u201cApparently the foreign nationals are alleged to have kidnapped about 17 school kids, Parents are advised to fetch their kids.\u201d\n\nThe video itself shows an agitated traffic warden pacing across the street while a crowd of people gather in front of a wall.\n\nSpeaking in Tswana, she looks into the camera and instructs parents to fetch their kids from school, cautioning that Pakistani nationals were \u201cgoing to all the schools\u201d.\n\n\u201cFetch your kids, I\u2019m here at Monde to fetch my child.Please fetch your kids from school, it\u2019s not safe, the Pakistanis are going to all the schools. Please,\u201d she says.\n\nAFP verified the location of the video as Monde Primary School, in Katlehong with a resident of the area.\n\nWe took recent images outside the school to compare with the video screenshots to identify the location where the traffic warden collected her child. The concrete wall, the tree without leaves on the right, the roof, and the metal gate are highlighted below.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear when exactly the video was filmed, but it began spreading on September 4 in posts claiming that Pakistanis were abducting children. Variants on the rumour quickly began spreading online, most of them locating the \u201ckidnappers\u201d in Katlehong.\n\nIn this tweet also posted on September 4, which was retweeted more than 900 times, the \u201ckidnappers\u201d were identified as Somali nationals. A specific school in Katlehong was also mentioned: Lungisani Primary School.\n\nSome posts said that 17 children had been kidnapped, others gave the number as 30. Various messages said that Lungisani Primary School had been set on fire. We\u2019ve archived a few of the panicked messages here, here and here.\n\nThe scare came after a wave of attacks on foreign-owned shops broke out in Johannesburg on September 1, prompting looting, fighting and, in Nigeria, reprisal attacks on South African-owned businesses.\n\nTen people were killed in the unrest in South Africa, the latest of numerous outbreaks of violence in recent years linked to tension over immigration. Migrants from other African countries, heading to the economic powerhouse in search of work, are often accused of taking up scarce jobs.\n\nAs reported by AFP, the tensions had eased by mid-week. However, there was continuing unrest in Katlehong, fuelling the kidnapping rumours.\n\nIn fact, officials said no school had been set on fire, and that there had been no reports of kidnappings by Pakistani or Somali nationals.\n\nThe education department for Gauteng province, which counts Johannesburg as its capital, described the rumours as \u201cfake news\u201d.\n\nIn a statement published on Facebook, the education department called on parents in the province not to panic -- saying that amidst the unrest, school was the safest place for people\u2019s children.\n\n\u201cWe would like to appeal to parents to remain calm and urge the community to refrain from disrupting teaching and learning. We believe that with the ongoing criminal activities, our schools are a safer and conducive environment for learners than roaming in the streets,\u201d Gauteng education chief Panyaza Lesufi said in the statement.\n\n\u201cThere are circulating social media posts suggesting that Lungisani Primary School was torched this morning, the department strongly refutes all these allegations. We want to reiterate that no school was burned today.\u201d\n\nLungisani Primary School -- the school which had found itself at the centre of the rumours -- similarly described them as \u201cfake and threatening rumours\u201d and confirmed that the school was safe. It deplored the fact that few children had come to school on Thursday after the rumours began spreading.\n\nLocal newspaper The Sowetan reported that 13 schools had briefly closed over the scare.\n\nIn a week marked by a flood of misleading social media posts about the violence -- you can read a round-up of AFP fact-checks here -- Gauteng Premier David Makhura said the traffic warden\u2019s comments had not helped.\n\n\u201cThe mayor will deal with an officer of the law, who basically is the one who circulated the video that caused lots of panic,\u201d Makhura told a provincial briefing.\n\n\u201cMany parents rushed to the schools to go and pick up their children -- that was fake news, total fake news. There were no Somalis, there were no Pakistanis who were going to schools to kidnap children.\u201d\n\nMzwandile Masina, mayor of the Ekurhuleni municipality which covers the area hit by the rumours, said the traffic warden had been suspended.\n\n\u201cThe decision has been made by the chief of police investigation to suspend the officer with immediate effect because she actually has plunged the city into crisis,\u201d said Masina.", "lang": "en"}
