The claim is true, but it doesn\u2019t include the number of people migrating from the UK to the EU: net migration in 2015 was +184,000. There is no single source that tracks migration to Northern Ireland. Medical card registrations are one method. The 2011 Census showed that 2.16% of the Northern Ireland population held an EU/EEA passport.\n\nThe Leave Campaign recently published a leaflet with \u2018eight facts\u2019 to support their case for leaving the European Union (EU). The first \u2018fact\u2019 is about migration: \u201cOver a quarter of a million people migrate to the UK from the EU every year.\u201d There is no statement in the leaflet about net migration (immigrants minus emigrants) nor the scale of immigration to Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that in 2015, 630,000 immigrants (i.e. those who change their country of residence for at least one year) entered the United Kingdom (UK). At the same time, 297,000 people left the UK. This sets net migration for that year at +333,000 people.\n\nOf the 630,000 immigrants to the UK in 2015: 270,000 came from the EU, 277,000 came from the rest of the world, and 83,000 were British citizens returning to the UK.\n\nWhile there were 270,000 immigrants from the EU in 2015, another 85,000 EU citizens emigrated from the UK; net migration from the EU to the UK in 2015 was +184,000.\n\nFrom the independent think tank, Migration Watch UK, the following graph shows net migration of EU citizens to the UK, based on ONS data, from 1991-2015:\n\nThere is no single source that tracks migration to Northern Ireland. NISRA estimates international (i.e. outside the UK) migration to Northern Ireland by using the registration and de-registration of medical cards. This produced the following graph, which shows inflows, outflows, and net international migration to Northern Ireland, from 2000-2014:\n\nFrom the graph above, for 2014 net migration to Northern Ireland is estimated at +2,237 people.\n\nThis NISRA report also presented a count of medical card registrations from non-UK nationals, by country of last residence. From this data, the following table shows registrations from previous EU residents, from 2010-2015 (n.b. de-registration data not presented here):\n\nOne can infer EU migration from the 2011 Census in Northern Ireland. By tracking passport ownership, data was collected on the nationalities of everyone in the country at the time of the census. There were 39,103 EU/EEA passports among the total population of 1,810,863. This amounts to 2.16% of the population.\n\nFactCheckNI is Northern Ireland\u2019s first and only dedicated independent fact-checking service and a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network\u2019s Code of Principles.
