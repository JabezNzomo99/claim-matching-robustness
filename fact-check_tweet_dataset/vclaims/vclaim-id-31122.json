The BJP spokesperson has mentioned India Today reporter Mausami Singh's name in his tweet.\n\nYou can view Bagga's tweet below and access its archived version here.\n\nBagga's tweet comes at a time when Singh is already in news for being manhandled at Srinagar airport on August 24. Singh was covering the Srinagar visit of Rahul Gandhi and other opposition leaders.\n\n\n\n\n\n You can watch the video here.\n\nAn opposition delegation led by Gandhi had reached Kashmir on Saturday to take stock of things in the valley after the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5. However, the delegation was sent back hours after it landed at the Srinagar airport.\n\nThe same viral clip has also been shared on several Facebook pages with the same fake claim.\n\nVideo From January 2019 And Not After The Abrogation of Article 370\n\n\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search on one of the frames from the viral clip and found a seven month old YouTube link that had the same video on January 24 this year.\n\nThe video has been shot in front of Anand Bhavan - the house museum of the Nehru family - in Prayagraj.\n\nThe same video was also tweeted by Major Surendra Poonia of the BJP in January. Poonia, in the caption, had accused Singh of planting pro-Priyanka and anti-Modi slogans in the crowd.\n\nMausami Singh Did Not Direct Congress Workers To Raise Slogans\n\nBOOM listened to the video closely and here is what we found.\n\nMausami Singh can be heard saying at the beginning of the video 'Uttar Pradesh me Congress party ki sachhi vichardhaara...kamzor logon ki vichaardhara...sabko le kar aage badhne ki baat hai.....aage bhi...ye Rahul Gandhi bol rahe hain.'\n\nHere, Mausami takes a momentary break and adjusts her ear piece.\n\nWe found the original video clip of the India Today show reporting Priyanka Gandhi's elevation in the party published on January 23 this year, the day Gandhi was appointed as in-charge for UP east. Here, Rahul Gandhi can be heard making the same statement verbatim as was said by Mausami Singh. However, the original footage doesn't include portions from the viral clip which seems to have been recorded by some onlooker before making it viral.\n\nFor Rahul Gandhi's byte on Priyanka Gandhi's elevation as party's Uttar Pradesh eat in-charge, watch from 4.56.\n\nFor Mausami Singh's reportage from Anand Bhavan, Prayagraj, watch from 6.35.\n\nLater in the video one can clearly hear people sloganeering 'Burn Down Modi's Lanka, Sister Priyanka' as Singh urges them to raise their voices.\n\nIf one listens to the video carefully, it becomes clear that the the reporter was not asking the crowd to raise any particular slogan and neither is the crowd repeating the words that she says.", "lang": "en"}
