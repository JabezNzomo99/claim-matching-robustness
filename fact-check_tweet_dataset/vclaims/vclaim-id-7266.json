How much are season tickets increasing by?\n\nThat\u2019s correct. \u201cRegulated rail fares\u201d from January 2019 in Great Britain will go up by July\u2019s inflation (RPI) which is 3.2%. Average wages have increased by 2.4% over the past 12 months.\n\nFor the past 15 years, it\u2019s been government policy to increase the share of rail operation paid for by passengers as opposed to subsidies (and by implication, taxpayers).\n\nWhich fares are going up?\n\nThe price rise applies to regulated rail fares which make up around 45% of all GB fares. They\u2019re primarily for commuter trips.\n\nThese are regulated in order to \u201cprotect passengers in markets where train operators have a significant degree of market power\u201d. Non-regulated fares are set by train operating companies.\n\nWhy are they going up?\n\nWhen fare policy was revisited in 2003, the Strategic Rail Authority said one of their aims was to \u201cto redress the balance between taxpayer and passenger, as increasing industry costs have so far been borne almost entirely by the taxpayer.\u201d\n\nThat was reiterated by the Coalition government who said they wanted to relieve pressure on public spending .\n\nIn 2011/12, \u00a38 billion of the rail industry\u2019s income came from passengers and \u00a34.3 billion came from the government (and therefore taxpayers). In 2016/17 passenger income went up to \u00a39.5 billion while government income fell to \u00a33.4 billion. So subsidies are decreasing as a share of rail funding.\n\nAs of 2012, commuter fares (which make up a large proportion of regulated fares) did not receive any taxpayer subsidy. Taxpayer subsidies went into regional and long-distance routes. (We\u2019ve asked the Department for Transport whether this is still the case and are waiting for their response.) Around 56% of train trips in England in 2016 were for commuting.\n\nAs a side note, while taxpayers contribute over \u00a33 billion towards the running of the railways, that\u2019s relatively small by European standards. Research done for the Office for Rail and Road in 2012 found that railways in Britain are \u201cmore user financed\u201d than in other European countries.\n\nHow much are fares going up by?\n\nRegulated fares will be going up by the level of the Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation measure for July \u2013 3.2%.\n\nFare increases have historically been linked to RPI. From 2004 to 2013 the cap in England was RPI+1%, and since 2014 it\u2019s been just at RPI.\n\nRPI is a measure of inflation that includes changes to mortgage costs. The Office for National Statistics (ONS), who publish the measure, say: \u201cWe do not think it is a good measure of inflation and discourage its use.\u201d\n\nThere are various technical reasons for why the ONS don\u2019t like RPI, but the main problem is that inflation measures are meant to measure the change in prices, and the ONS say that with RPI, \u201cthe evidence suggests it is likely to overstate inflation.\u201d\n\nThat means that some people criticise government for using RPI to set regulated fares.\n\nThe Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has called for rail fare increases to be pegged to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), an official measure of inflation typically around 1% lower than RPI. He also says the same measure should be used for calculating wage rises in the industry.\n\nSimply put, no. While regulated fares will increase by 3.2%, wages over the past 12 months have grown by 2.4%.\n\nIt is theoretically possible that the commuters as a group may have experienced a wage increase higher than that of the broader population, but we\u2019ve not been able to find data that separates out commuters\u2019 wages. (Rail passengers tend to have higher incomes, but this doesn\u2019t tell you anything about how their wages are changing.)\n\nAlso, given that the aim of rail fare policy is to reduce taxpayer subsidy, we looked at whether tax cuts in recent years (primarily through the growth of the personal allowance) counterbalanced the fare rises. We found this makes very little difference to the calculations.\n\nFor example, from April 2017 \u2013 April 2018, pre-tax wages increased by 2.6%. After applying tax changes, take-home pay increased by 2.7%.", "lang": "en"}
