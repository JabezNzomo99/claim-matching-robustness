The clip is actually from an Indian satirical news segment that runs on the Hindi news channel Aaj Tak.\n\nIn the 48 seconds cartoon clip, Xi Jinping and Modi fight off each other with Indian Prime Minister emerging victorious against China with the support of other state leaders including Russsian President Vladimir Putin, United States President Donald Trump, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe.\n\nThe clip is being shared in the backdrop of a skirmish between Indian and Chinese troops at the Galwan Valley in Eastern Ladakh on June 15-16, 2020 which left nearly 20 Indian soldiers dead and more injured.

On comparing both the clips it becomes clear that it is taken from the So Sorry segment titled, \"36 \u0915\u093e \u0906\u0902\u0915\u0921\u093c\u093e\" which idiom roughly translates to rivalry in English.\n\nWhile the viral video shows the names of the world leaders as they first appear displayed in Japanese text, that is not how it appears in the original clip linked above.\n\nOn searching in Japanese with the relevant keywords like 'Modi' 'Xi Jinping' we found that the So Sorry clip was being shared by Japanese Twitter users appreciating it. The translation of the tweet reads, \"The person who made this must have a genius sense! !! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 [Anime \"Xi Jinping and Modi prime minister, Kamehameha confrontation (Prime Minister Abe also appeared)\"....\"\n\nThis clip also has the Japanese text as in the viral clip. The tweet also links to a YouTube video uploaded on June 29, 2020, that has the same viral clip.\n\nA look at the video shows the Aaj Tak logo in the clip with only the text in Japanese.\n\nBOOM reached out to the YouTube channel '\u30a2\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9' (Anti Red), which confirmed that the So Sorry video viral with Japanese text was added and uploaded by the channel.\n\n\"Yes, I added the Japanese subtitles, not only this video but many. Whenever I get interesting videos, I add Japanese subtitles and upload to spread in my Youtube channel for four months,\" the YouTuber told BOOM.\n\nAlso Read: Was Modi's Visit To Leh Hospital Staged?
