The elephant who originally belonged to Silent Valley National Park (SVNP), Palakkad remained calm though she was under excruciating pain. She faced one of the most brutal forms of animal abuse as the fruit exploded in her mouth, leading to her death.\n\n\n\nAs public discourse ensued over the cruelty the wild elephant-faced, a graphic started circulating online which apparently shows the culprit behind the horrific incident. The image shows 2 photos, a man on one side and the elephant's on the other side. \"In Kerala, he killed a pregnant elephant with a pineapple, and should be severely punished for killing the animal,\" reads the caption of one such viral post.\n\nAccording to the report, Madhu, a 27-year-old tribal youth of Kaduka Manna region in Attappady, got caught by a group of people who tied him up for several hours. He was also beaten with sticks. Madhu used to allegedly steal rice and other food items from shops in the area.\n\n\n\nThe man was later handed over to the police at Mukkali junction. He, however, died on his way to the hospital. According to an official at the Agali police station, he appeared to be mentally unsound.
