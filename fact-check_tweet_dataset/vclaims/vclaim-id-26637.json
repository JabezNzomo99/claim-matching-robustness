A graphic pertaining to News18\u2019s anchor Amish Devgan\u2019s show \u2018Aar Paar\u2019 is generating a lot of buzz on social media. The graphic, which includes a picture of news anchor Amish Devgan, has text which translates to \u201cDid Modi\u2019s pressure force Trump to eliminate Baghdadi?\u201d The ISIS Chief was killed by the US military in a raid conducted in northwest Syria. Among those who shared the image is Congress leader Sachin Choudhary. However, he later deleted the tweet. The graphic is being widely circulated on Twitter with the claim that Devgan, on his show, will discuss how Prime Minister Modi\u2019s pressure on US President Donald Trump led to the killing of ISIS Chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Screenshot of the viral claim on Twitter. The post has also found its way to Facebook.\n\nThe Quint could verify that the graphic has been photoshopped. A key word search using the terms \u2018Amish Devgan\u2019 and \u2018Aar Paar\u2019 directed us to the original graphic which was uploaded by the news channel on 24 September 2019 during Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to the United States for the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). The original graphic which was uploaded by the news channel on 24 September. There are multiple red flags which hint towards the fact that the graphic template has been tampered with. Firstly, on the top right corner of the graphic plate which is being shared online there\u2019s an unexplained grey mark. Baghdadi is wearing a black robe and the background colour of the text plate is red. So where does this come from?\n\nThis comes from the original image which has the images of Modi and US President Donald Trump on one side and Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on the other. A portion of the grey suit that Khan is seen wearing has not been superimposed with the brown colour used under the hindi text. The second thing which makes it evident that the graphic is edited is the font size and the font style of the text which is written in Hindi. On viewing the template of the graphic used for the show, we could see that the fonts don\u2019t match. Another thing which doesn\u2019t match the usual template or the show design is the background colour of the text plate. The usual colour used by the channel is brown but the post which is now viral uses red colour. Further, the show anchor Amish Devgan took to Twitter to clarify that the image has been photoshopped and that the channel didn\u2019t run a show crediting Modi for Baghdadi\u2019s death. We also checked News18\u2019s website and YouTube channel and looked at episodes of Devgan\u2019s show aired after Baghdadi\u2019s death to find that no such episode had been aired.", "lang": "en"}
