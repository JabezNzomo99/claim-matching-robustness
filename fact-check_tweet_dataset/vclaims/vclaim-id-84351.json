We also got in touch with the woman who can be seen in the midst of the brawl between Supriyo and the students.\n\nBabul Supriyo, Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, visited the Jadavpur University campus on September 19 to attend a freshers\u2019 party organised by the ABVP, the students\u2019 wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party.\n\nSupriyo was blocked by hundreds of students from the Student Federation of India (SFI) and its affiliates for over five hours until Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar came to his rescue. The students insisted that Supriyo should not enter the campus as he represented a \u201cfascist force.\u201d\n\nThe posts shared on multiple Facebook pages have featured two images \u2013 one taken during Supriyo\u2019s heated interaction with the students and the other a screenshot of Shilpi Afreen\u2019s Facebook profile, in a bid to identify the woman in the first photograph.\n\nThe images have been accompanied with a derogatory caption, which can be loosely translated to, \u201cAre these women sexually frustrated? They are purposely tearing a man\u2019s shirt and trying to be touched by him without consent so that they can claim that they have been molested. As there is no stringent law against men who are molested, these women are taking its advantage. This should be discussed at a larger level. A union minister is being molested. And because they are not males they can do anything by showing these images. Why would a singer be subjected to such a behaviour for attending a freshers\u2019 party? Now we know why Communists are hated through out the world.\u201d\n\nMultiple posts have also shared the now deactivated account of Shilpi Afreen to falsely claim that \u201cshe is a disgrace to womanhood,\" as an aftermath of the protests against Supriyo.\n\nNot only is a screenshot of the Afreen's profile but BOOM also observed that multiple of her images are viral with a similar narrative.\n\nBOOM could ascertain that the woman photographed with Babul Supriyo is not Shilpi Afreen, whose Facebook bio describes her as a Philosophy student from the varsity.\n\nWe reached out to Afreen who seemed to be shaken at the turn of events. She said, \u201cThat is not me in the photograph. I have been getting threat calls since yesterday following which I had to deactivate my Facebook profile.\u201d\n\nAfreen also informed BOOM that she was harassed and given rape threats through Facebook messenger and WhatsApp from the time her photographs went viral.\n\n\u201cShilpi is very scared. She has been flooded with abuses since yesterday. We are trying to provide her complete protection,\u201d Sandip Naskar, local committee president of JU, SFI, told BOOM.\n\nFurthermore, we got in touch with the student pictured with Supriyo.\n\nBOOM has decided not to reveal the same in order to protect her identity.", "lang": "en"}
