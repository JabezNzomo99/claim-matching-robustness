While it is true that Kevin Jonas Rojano-Nieto assaulted a 3-year-old girl and judge M. Marc Kelly only sentenced him to 10 years instead of 25 for it in 2014, he did never claim the little girl \"asked for it\". And on appeal the sentence will most likely be increased to the full 25 years.\n\nYourNewsWire's article titled \"Judge Cuts Pedophile's Prison Term Claiming 3-Yr-Old 'Asked' To Be Raped\" (which is archived here) was published on February 10th 2018 and opened:\n\nA California judge has caused outrage after slashing 15 years off the prison sentence of a pedophile convicted of raping a 3-year-old child. Orange County Superior Court Judge M. Marc Kelly cut the child rapist's prison term down to ten years from 25 years claiming that \"he didn't mean to harm\" the 3-year-old girl that he raped. He also backed the claim from child rapist Kevin Rojano that the young girl initiated the act of sodomy. Rojano said in his own defense that \"she asked me to do it.\"\n\nNote YourNewsWire doesn't mention this happened in 2014 as you can read in this article on the Orange County Register. It also conveniently omits to mention more recent reporting about the appeals case in which the judge literally said Rojano would get 25 years:\n\nThe higly misleading story managed to rack up over 75,000 likes/shares/comments on Facebook in a very short period of time, probably leading to an advertising revenue bonanza for the site.\n\nYourNewsWire has published several hoaxes and fake news articles in the past so anything they write or publish should be taken with a large grain of salt. Their Facebook page \"The People's Voice\" recently lost its verification checkmark according to a report from MMFA.\n\nThe Terms of Use of the site also make it clear they don't really stand behind the accuracy of any of their reporting:\n\nThe site was profiled in the Hollywood reporter where it was described as:\n\nRationalWiki described it as:\n\nA while ago we also reported that YourNewsWire had rebranded itself as NewsPunch by changing its domain name in an apparent effort to evade filtering/blocking. It appears the site has changed back to it's old name in the mean time but you can still see the NewsPunch name in the contact email address in the footer.", "lang": "en"}
