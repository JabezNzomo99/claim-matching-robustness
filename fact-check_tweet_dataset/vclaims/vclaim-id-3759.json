Facebook user Yves Merlette posted this video with following caption, originally in French:\n\nMeeting between trump and the city governor of Mexico city (sent by a Brazilian friend): a video that will certainly not be shown On TV in the USA!!! (not in France!!)\n\nHere is an embedded version of the video (which is also archived here):\n\nThe post was published on March 14, 2018 with the originally French caption \"Rencontre entre Trump et le gouverneur de la ville de Mexico (envoy\u00e9 par un ami br\u00e9silien) : une vid\u00e9o qui ne sera certainement pas montr\u00e9e \u00e0 la TV aux USA !!! (ni en France!!)\" (archived here).\n\nIn fact the video was shown on TV in the United States but it predates the Trump presidency by quite a few years. It shows a clip from the WrestleMania 23 event that took place on April 1, 2007 and in which Donald Trump fought with Vince McMahon in a staged fight.", "lang": "en"}
