Here\u2019s a rundown of polls back to January 2016. (Figures shown are support followed by opposition.)\n\nAll but one of these polls had Democratic support above 90 percent -- between 91 percent and 98 percent. And all but one of these polls had Republican support above 77 percent -- between 85 and 93 percent.\n\nKimmel: \"89 percent of Republicans and Democrats are in favor of restricting gun ownership for the mentally ill.\"\n\nKimmel overstated recent survey results, but only slightly. (We assumed that Kimmel meant the overall results from all respondents, rather than saying that 89 percent of both Republicans and Democrats favored that policy. The polls do not support the latter interpretation.)\n\nThe most recent poll to ask this question was CNN/ORC in June 2016, the month of the Pulse night club shooting in Orlando: \"Please tell me whether you would generally favor or oppose each of the following proposals which some people have made to reduce the amount of gun violence. \u2026 Preventing certain people, such as convicted felons or people with mental health problems, from owning guns.\"\n\nIn this poll, 87 percent of respondents supported that policy, and 12 percent opposed it.\n\nThe only other polls we found that asked a similar question go back to 2015 and earlier.\n\nQuinnipiac University asked something similar three times, in September 2015, June 2014 and September 2013. In each case, either 88 or 89 percent supported the policy and 9 percent opposed it.\n\nPew Research Center polls from January 2013 and July 2015 found the lowest support levels of recent polls, though support was still substantial.\n\nThe July 2015 poll found 79 percent support and 19 percent opposition. The January 2013 poll found 80 percent support and 16 percent opposition.\n\nKimmel: \"Right now there are loopholes in the law that let people avoid background checks if they buy a gun privately from another party, if they buy a gun online or at a gun show.\"\n\nKimmel is correct that certain private gun sales do not require background checks.\n\nAll federally licensed gun dealers must run checks. But as we\u2019ve noted previously, not all sellers need to be licensed. And some unlicensed sellers sell guns privately to others, sometimes transacting sales over the Internet or at gun shows.\n\nWhen previously examined the phrase \"gun show loophole,\" some experts told that to refer to such exemptions as \"loopholes\" is a bit of a misnomer because the law intended to exclude certain sellers.\n\n\"The term \u2018loophole\u2019 suggests that it was a minor, unintended flaw in the design of the law, something inadvertently overlooked by lawmakers,\" Gary Kleck, a criminologist at Florida State University, told PolitiFact in January. \"It was actually the very intentional result of a carefully worked-out political compromise between those who wanted background checks on all gun acquisitions and those who did not want any at all.\"\n\nCorden: \"11,660 people have died from gun violence in the last 275 days in this country. ... How does every other developed country do a better job at preventing these attacks?\"\n\nCorden appears to be largely correct on the numbers, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit organization that tracks gun-related injuries and deaths.\n\nSince Jan. 1, 2017, the group has counted 11,686 deaths through Oct. 3, 2017 (presumably Corden was citing Gun Violence Archive figures that were current as of the time of taping, hence the discrepancy). We'd note these figures do not include suicides.\n\nHowever, Corden\u2019s claim comparing United States to other developed countries is a bit trickier to parse. If he\u2019s referring to gun homicides, we\u2019ve previously rated it Mostly True that Americans are 25 times more likely to be shot and killed than others in developed countries.\n\nBut if by \"other attacks\" Corden meant mass shootings, then the picture is more complex.\n\nNoah: \"Just to give you an idea of how far away America is from actual gun control, this week Congress is going to vote on deregulating gun silencers. Because I guess Congress is thinking gun violence is out of control: 'How can we make it quieter?' \"\n\nNoah is correct that Congress was expected to vote on a bill to relax restrictions on buying suppressors, sometimes referred to as silencers. But according to reports, House Republican leaders appear to have postponed indefinitely a vote on the bill. (It\u2019s possible news of the postponement hadn\u2019t reached Noah before airtime.)\n\n\"That bill is not scheduled now, I don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to be scheduled,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution.\n\nThe measure, known as the Hearing Protection Act, is part of the Sportsmen\u2019s Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act.\n\nNoah\u2019s reference to quieting out-of-control gun violence was a wry commentary about a pattern of gun-related homicides appearing to fall on deaf ears in Congress.\n\nBut when it comes to the literal effect of suppressors, there\u2019s disagreement over the extent to which the accessory would reduce the volume of gunfire during active shootings. Gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety has previously tweeted that \"hearing shots can be the difference between life & death.\" NRA Spokeswoman Dana Loesch tweeted that suppressors \"only reduce by around 30 decibels,\" which is akin to the front row of a rock concert. (We are working on a related fact-check and will share our results when it is finished.)", "lang": "en"}
