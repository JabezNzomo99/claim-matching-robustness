If there is, the expectation will be for the government to publish the information in more accessible media channels for citizens.\n\nIn the face of the covid-19 outbreak in Nigeria, the Federal Government announced the closure of schools until the proper containment of the coronavirus in affected states. In the face of this, rumours regarding the reopening of schools never seem to end.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of controversies surrounding school resumption dates, with different blogs publishing unverified dates ranging from May 1st November to the June 1st date by this Facebook user June 1st 2020.\n\nRecently, there has been an increase in misinformation as to the approved dates for the resumption of schools. Amidst these, the most recent says the federal government\u2019s resumption date is June 1st 2020.\n\nOver two weeks ago, the Federal ministry of education advised Nigerians to shun news circulating in this regard. Through her spokesperson, Ben Goong, the department debunked every claim that schools were to re-open at specific dates.\n\nThis rebuttal published by PREMIUM TIMES on the 13th of April quoted the spokesperson of the ministry of education as saying; \u201cOn the issue of reopening of schools, the ministry has not directed the reopening of any school at any level\u201d. We are urging parents and guardians not to be misled by fake news but to continue to abide by the government\u2019s regulations to tackle the ravaging pandemic.\n\nThe Federal Government has in no way announced or declared a date for general resumption of schools. Moreover, several schools have gone virtual in their bid to make sure their students don\u2019t miss out on the term\u2019s syllabus during the lockdown.\n\nContrary to the reopening claim, the Federal government has announced plans to disinfect schools nationwide; this was, of course, premised on collaborating with the ministry of education to collate data on schools nationwide.\n\nThe Presidential task force confirmed this during a briefing already published by PREMIUM TIMES and other newspapers.\n\nIn essence, there is currently no specific date for schools to resume classes; parents\u2019 best bet is to wait for further directives from the Federal government.\n\nEducational establishments in the country, currently, do not have a scheduled date of resumption. The Federal Government, however, did announce plans for nation-wide decontamination of schools, without providing a date for schools to resume.", "lang": "en"}
