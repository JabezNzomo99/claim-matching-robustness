The quote is missing some context.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2018-05-14T21:44:35Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-86035", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/10/08/the-repeated-claim-that-obama-vowed-to-bankrupt-coal-plants/", "vclaim": "This made us wonder: When did the president make such a statement? (For her part, Grimes also runs ads saying she opposes Obama on \u201cgun, coal and the EPA.\u201d The ad makes the dubious connection that because she, as a Democrat, supports Obama and because Obama hates coal, she\u2019s anti-coal)\n\nCrossroads spokesman Paul Lindsay pointed us to an interview that Obama gave to the San Francisco Chronicle in January 2008 \u2014 before he became president. He was then just a senator, but he was running for president, and he was asked about his proposal for an aggressive cap-and-trade system to limit greenhouse gas emissions and provide incentives to turn to new technologies. Lindsey sent us this clip:\n\nIn the clip, Obama says: \u201cSo if somebody wants to build a coal power plant, they can. It\u2019s just that it will bankrupt them because they are going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that\u2019s being emitted.\u201d\n\nThis is what came before that statement, which was prompted by question asking how he squared his support for coal and his promise to limit greenhouse gas emissions, given that coal is considered such a pollutant.\n\n\u201cThis notion of no coal, I think, is an illusion, because the fact of the matter is that right now, we are getting a lot of our energy from coal, and China is building a coal-fired plant once a week. So what we have to do then is we have to figure out how can we use coal without emitting greenhouse gases and carbon. And how can we sequester that carbon and capture it? If we can\u2019t, then we\u2019re going to still be working on alternatives.\u201d\n\nThen Obama goes on to describe his version of a cap-and-trade system, which he said would create \u201cmarket in which whatever technologies out there are being presented, whatever power plants are being built, that they would have to meet the rigors of that market and the ratcheted-down caps that are imposed every year.\u201d Then he said the sentence that forms the basis for this \u201cbankrupt\u201d claim.\n\nIn other words, Obama was talking about disincentives to building coal-powered plants with old technology, not coal plants with cleaner technology. That\u2019s an important distinction. He is also talking about a hypothetical, not making a \u201cvow\u201d to bankrupt coal operators.\n\nAs for Obama\u2019s cap-and-trade proposal, it never emerged from Congress. The administration has announced rules to cut carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants by up to 30 percent by 2030, compared to 2005 levels, which certainly could be fodder for an ad\u2014but that\u2019s not the same thing as a snippet of a conversation from nearly seven years ago.\n\nThis is another one of those gotcha statements, when an inartfully worded statement is treated as a moment of high policy. In context, it\u2019s clear that Obama made no vow to bankrupt coal operators \u2014 though he clearly wanted to push for a system that would promote cleaner uses of coal and other forms of energy and a phase-out of dirtier plants. Given that his old proposal is dead and buried, it seems odd to dredge it up again and again.", "lang": "en"}
