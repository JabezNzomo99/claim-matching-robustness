Among members of Congress during this election cycle, Cantor ranks No. 10. His $187,250 from the oil and gas industry groups trails Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who topped the list with $358,200.\n\n \n\n Others who surpass Cantor in oil and gas money are Rep. Rick Berg, R-N.D.; Rep. Denny Rehberg, R-Mont.; Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio; Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo.; House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.; Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., and Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich.\n\n \n\n Among House members, he ranks No. 7. In the 2009-10 cycle, he ranked 18th.\n\n \n\n Cantor\u2019s campaign committee had raised $6.3 million and spent $5.1 million as of July 30. That ranks No. 4 among current House candidates, behind Boehner, Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., and Allen West, R-Fla.\n\n \n\n In his leadership PAC, the Every Republican Is Crucial PAC, Cantor raised $4.4 million and spent nearly all of it. Oil and gas industry groups donated $68,650 to his PAC.\n\n \n\n Powell\u2019s campaign has apologized for the inaccurate claim and changed the statement, which we encourage others to do when they realize their claims aren\u2019t up to snuff.\n\n \n\n Our ruling\n\n \n\n The Powell campaign accused Cantor of having collected more money from oil and gas industry folks than any other member of Congress. They quickly acknowledged that the statement was false and changed it.\n\n \n\n We applaud them for changing the claim, but we still have to rate the original one.\n\n \n\n The claim was False.", "lang": "en"}
