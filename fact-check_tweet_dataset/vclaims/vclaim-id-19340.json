While a few odd coincidences exist, Simpsons prediction hoaxes may outnumber actual Simpsons predictions.\n\nFor example, \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d did not predict that U.S. President Donald Trump would ride down an escalator while announcing his bid for president; Lady Gaga\u2019s Superbowl halftime show; the video game Pokemon Go; the fire at Notre Dame cathedral; a mass shooting during a screening of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d; Trump\u2019s touching a glowing orb; or Trump\u2019s death.\n\nIn August 2019, after Trump mulled the idea of buying Greenland and then announced that he was canceling a trip to the area after Denmark\u2019s prime minister rejected the idea, another Simpsons \u201cprediction\u201d started to circulate on social media.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted a message on Twitter about how the animated show had predicted the kerfuffle.\n\nWhile these tweets were likely posted in jest, some people didn\u2019t quite get the joke. At least two threads were started on \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d section of Reddit asking if the prediction was real, and multiple people chimed in on Twitter about the show\u2019s uncanny ability to tell the future. Murphy\u2019s tweet was also shared on Fark as proof that \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d creator Matt Groening had a time machine.\n\nWe searched Frinkiac, a website named after the Simpsons\u2019 bumbling mad-scientist character Professor Frink. The site allows fans to search the show\u2019s archives for favorite quotes and jokes. And nothing surfaced for mentions of the words \u201cGreenland,\u201d \u201cTrump,\u201d and \u201cDenmark\u201d together.\n\nFurthermore, we\u2019ve previously covered the show\u2019s \u201cpredictions\u201d about Trump\u2019s presidency. And as far as we can tell, the first mention of a \u201cPresident Trump\u201d came during the season 11 episode, \u201cBart to the Future,\u201d in 2000. Trump was mentioned in prior seasons, but never as president or a potential buyer of Greenland:", "lang": "en"}
