(June was the most recent month for which data was available when Obama gave his speech.)\n\nAs the chart shows, the total for 2013 is indeed the highest since 1999.\n\nHowever, we\u2019ll take this opportunity to note a caveat that\u2019s often overlooked in the discussion of employment statistics: The figures released by the BLS actually represent the midpoint in a range.\n\nBLS obtains these numbers through a survey of businesses and government agencies, and as with any survey, there\u2019s a margin of sampling error.\n\nBLS told us that for private-sector employment figures, the standard margin of error for a six-month comparison of this sort is 106,370 jobs on either side. This means, for instance, that if the reported change in jobs is 1,000,000, the actual change is assumed to be somewhere within the range of 893,630 to 1,106,370 jobs.\n\nThis point may seem esoteric, but it\u2019s relevant for the comparison Obama\u2019s making because several other years since 1999 have produced job increases very close to the gain of 1,234,000 during the first six months of 2013.\n\nIn the three years noted in italics in the chart -- 2012, 2011 and 2005 -- the gain in private-sector jobs fell shy of the 2013 amount by fewer than 106,370. Such cases are analogous to an election poll with a margin of error of 3 percentage points that shows one candidate two points ahead of the other. Such races are deemed too close to call. So too, technically speaking, is the contest for which six-month period created the biggest gain in private-sector jobs -- 2013, 2012, 2011 or 2005.\n\nOf course, three of these four years came on Obama\u2019s watch. One -- 2005 -- came under President George W. Bush.\n\nObama said, \"This year, we're off to our best private-sector jobs growth since 1999.\" The official statistics show that more jobs were created in the first six months of 2013 than in any equivalent period going back to 1999, but it\u2019s worth noting that three other years came very close to the amount gained in 2013 -- so close that they were within the survey\u2019s margin of error. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
