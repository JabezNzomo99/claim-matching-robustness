Just under 21% of inspected state schools in England were rated as outstanding for \u201coverall effectiveness\u201d by Ofsted inspectors.\n\nIn comparison, almost 82% of the 163 selective schools in England were rated as outstanding and 17% were rated good. That totals 99%, as the Prime Minister says\n\nAltogether, 88% of inspected schools were rated as good or outstanding as of August this year.\n\nThis includes nurseries, primary schools, secondary schools, special schools and pupil referral units. It ignores schools that haven\u2019t been inspected.\n\nHow do selective schools compare to other secondary schools?\n\nAll of the selective schools in England are secondary schools. Of the 3,000 non-selective secondary schools that have been inspected, 19% were rated \u201coutstanding\u201d. Altogether 76% were rated as good or outstanding.\n\nWhile only two selective schools were rated as \u201crequiring improvement\u201d, or 1%, for non-selective schools 19% were in this category.\n\nThere were no selective schools rated as \u201cinadequate\u201d, but 8% of non-selective secondaries were.\n\nIs there an economic effect?\n\nStudents who attend selective schools are, by definition, higher achievers, and less likely to be entitled to free school meals.\n\nOfsted data shows that 40% of grammar schools take their pupils from the least deprived postcodes. For non-selective secondary schools, this figure was only 20%.\n\nYou could argue that it\u2019s easier for schools to get a good Ofsted rating in those circumstances.\n\nStudies have looked into the relationship between the economic background of pupils and the rating received by the school. The Sutton Trust, a social mobility think tank, found that primary schools rated \u201coutstanding\u201d were much more likely to have pupils from a higher economic background. The report also stresses that although this was the case, one did not necessarily cause the other.\n\nThe head of Ofsted has also suggested that in selective areas good and experienced teachers are more likely to want to teach at grammars, citing research by Education Datalab.\n\nAn inspection usually lasts two days. Ofsted says that its inspectors consider:\n\nThe data doesn\u2019t mean that 88% of inspected schools were rated as outstanding or good this year. The figures are based on the ratings a school was given the last time it was inspected. For some schools that will mean this year, for others it might mean ten years ago.\n\nIt all depends on the rating a school has and whether or not Ofsted thinks they need to be inspected.\n\nSchools that are judged to be outstanding don\u2019t generally have to be inspected, though there are some exceptions. Instead Ofsted will monitor the school\u2019s performance beginning three years after an \u201coutstanding\u201d rating to see whether or not inspections need to be done.\n\nSchools judged to be good at their last inspection receive shorter inspections, lasting only one day. These begin three years after a \u201cgood\u201d rating is awarded. They\u2019ll receive a full inspection if any concerns are raised or standards are seen to decline.\n\nOfsted, or the Office for Standards in Education, Children\u2019s Services and Skills, is an independent body which reports directly to Parliament. It\u2019s responsible for monitoring the state of services in England that care for and educate children and young people.\n\nOfsted inspectors visit maintained schools, academies, and some independent schools as well as other educational institutions. They also monitor childcare, adoption and fostering facilities as well as teacher training.\n\nWe\u2019ve recently looked at the government\u2019s proposals for selective schools as well as comparing other types of schools.", "lang": "en"}
