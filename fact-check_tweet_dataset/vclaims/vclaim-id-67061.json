Fire tornadoes occur when intense heat from a wildfire rises and surrounding air quickly replaces it, causing a spinning column of air, according to USA Today.\n\nThe video in the Aug. 20 Facebook post appears to show firefighters trying to put out a fire tornado while the wind picks up their hose. The video\u2019s caption identifies it as a scene in California and includes a link to a YouTube video of the same footage, also claiming to be from the ongoing California wildfires.\n\nHowever, Check Your Fact found the video in a September 2018 article on Canada\u2019s publicly-owned news service, CBC News. The video was filmed by firefighter Mary Schidlowsky during a wildfire near Vanderhoof, British Columbia, on Aug. 18, 2018, according to the article. Schidlowsky shared the video on her Instagram account Sept. 15, 2018.\n\n\u201cFire tornado (fire devil) destroyed our line. It threw burning logs across our guard for 45 minutes and pulled our hose 100 plus ft in the air before melting it. That\u2019s definitely a first,\u201d Schidlowsky wrote on Instagram. \u201cNote: It got over 200ft tall but the smoke was too think (sic) to see it clearly on video.\u201d (RELATED: Does This Image Show The 2020 California Wildfires From Above The Clouds?)\n\nCalFire, California\u2019s fire fighting agency, has reported more than 700 wildfires covering over 1.3 million acres of land since Aug. 15, according to The Washington Post.", "lang": "en"}
