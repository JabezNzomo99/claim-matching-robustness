A new program from the National Rifle Association, in partnership with Smith & Wesson, seeks to change that. Share the Safety is a revolutionary online store that will open its digital doors on July 4. Taking its cue from other \u201cbuy one, give one\u201d retailers, customers of ShareTheSafety.org will have the pleasure of knowing that for each handgun purchased, one will be donated to an at-risk American citizen in the urban center of their choice. \u201cWe know that the only protection from bad guys are good guys with guns,\u201d said Hensley Cocker, Program Director of Share the Safety. \u201cBut tragically the people who need to protect themselves the most \u2014 the urban poor \u2014 are often unable to afford a lifesaving firearm. We\u2019re excited to watch the impact this will have on our nation\u2019s undeserved communities.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the above-quoted press release, the ShareTheSafety.org web site was launched to inform people how they could participate in the new program:\n\nHowever, neither the web site nor the press release is affiliated with the NRA. Amber Niblock, the digital media manager for the NRA, confirmed that the \u201cShare the Safety\u201d web site was a hoax:\n\nThe ShareTheSafety.org web site used several tactics to fool users into thinking they were viewing an official NRA web site. For instance, all of the social media links on ShareTheSafety.org pointed to official NRA accounts, and the fake press release was published on a web site nearly identical to that of the National Rifle Association\u2019s lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA):\n\nOne obvious difference between the two web sites to knowledgeable viewers was that the fake press release was published on NRApress.org (not affiliated with the NRA) while the NRA-ILA\u2019s web site resides at nraila.org.", "lang": "en"}
