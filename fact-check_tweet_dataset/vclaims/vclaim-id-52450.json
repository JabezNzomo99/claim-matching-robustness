It is being claimed that these tanks are being transported by the Indian Army to the Indo-China border.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above video and found that the claim attached to the video is FAKE.\n\nWe extracted the keyframes of the video and put them through Reverse Image Search. The search results led us to the extended version of the same video on YouTube which was posted on July 16, 2017.\n\nThe caption of the video read: \u201cBNSF Military (Abrams Tanks) Train over Tehachapi\u201d\n\nUpon searching, we found that BNSF is a part of the US Military and Tehachapi is a town in California. Moreover, at the beginning of the video, the date appears which is April 22, 2017.\n\nIn conclusion, upon putting our discoveries together, we can safely say that the video in question is OLD. It is from the United States, hence, it has no connection to the Indian Army.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
