They are invaders!\"\n\nThis story was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It\u2019s accompanied with three images, one showing a man\u2019s face as he lights a flag on fire, another of a flag burning on the ground, and a third of a man holding a burning flag surrounded by a group.\n\nBut the photos aren\u2019t from Mexico, where the migrants are now walking toward the southern border. The first image is the thumbnail used on Fox News TV reports on an anti-Trump protest in New Mexico that turned violent in May 2016. And the flag isn\u2019t an American flag but a Trump flag. \"Trump for president 2016,\" it says. \"Make America Great Again!\"\n\nThe second photo was taken by Dan Kitwood, a Getty Images photographer who took a picture of a flag burning outside the American embassy in London during a protest in September 2010. As a stock image, it has been repurposed in subsequent stories, like one about Judge John Bates and a Deadspin article about \"movies that made us feel crappy about America.\"\n\nThe third photo is care of Reuters, and shows protesters burning the American flag outside the Republican National Convention in 2016.\n\nOn Oct. 19, two people burned an American flag \"during a protest in favor of the caravan of migrants,\" according to a caption to an Associated Press photo that shows two men holding the corners of a burning flag with a swastika scrawled on it. But that happened in front of the American embassy in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, when the caravan was stuck at the Guatemala-Mexico border.\n\nWe haven\u2019t found credible reports of other instances of flag-burnings connected to the caravan, and no stories of migrants making the march north burning the American flag themselves. As some Americans fret about the growing group en route to the U.S.-Mexico border, this post misuses old, unrelated photos of flag-burnings and wrongly feeds fears of an invasion.
