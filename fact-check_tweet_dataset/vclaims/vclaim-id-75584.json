REUTERS/Amit Dave - RTSUD7L[/caption] Swathes of identical tweets hailing the success of demonetisation cropped up on Twitter on Thursday as the government went on a public relations overdrive to prove the benefits of demonetisation a day after the Reserve Bank of India released a report which led many to debate whether the move was worth the disruption to the economy. Several senior ministers were also responsible for hammering home the message on social media that demonetisation achieved its stated objectives, despite rumblings from the opposition and a tiny section of the media. In its annual report for 2016-17 released on Wednesday, the RBI said about Rs 15.28 lakh crore of the Rs 15.44 lakh crore of notes taken out of circulation, had found its way back to the system via deposits by the public. This means only 16,000 crore was not deposited back to the banks and 99% of the demonetised notes made a return.

Infographics, quizzes, images and Periscope Lives are all part of its social media arsenal. Followers of the BJP are the most vocal on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. It also uses the more direct and private medium of WhatsApp to spread its message. The party has also been accused of creating bots and troll accounts to counter negative social media narratives. The amorphous nature of social media engagement makes these types of online behaviour acceptable but raises the question whether the average Indian is aware of these meticulously planned PR tactics and manufactured public opinion.", "lang": "en"}
