The Trump campaign demanded Kelly\u2019s removal from the Jan. 28 debate, but the network refused, inciting the billionaire\u2019s ire and a boycott.\n\nIn response, the network wrote in an :\n\n\"Donald Trump is refusing to debate seven of his fellow presidential candidates on stage that night, which is near unprecedented.\n\n\"We\u2019re not sure how Iowans are going to feel about him walking away from them at the last minute, but it should be clear to the American public by now that this is rooted in one thing \u2013 Megyn Kelly, whom he has viciously attacked since August and has now spent four days demanding be removed from the debate stage. Capitulating to politicians\u2019 ultimatums about a debate moderator violates all journalistic standards, as do threats, including the one leveled by Trump\u2019s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski toward Megyn Kelly.\"\n\nWe were curious about Fox\u2019s assertion that Trump\u2019s decision is \"near unprecedented.\"\n\nWe didn\u2019t hear back from the network, but our research finds Fox\u2019s claim is slightly exaggerated. Many other candidates on both sides of the aisle have ditched debate, but the clearest connection to Trump happened more than 35 years ago, when then-frontrunner Ronald Reagan skipped the final debate before the Iowa caucus in 1980.\n\nLet\u2019s go through some examples of candidates passing up the chance to debate, tracing back from the cycle we\u2019re in now.\n\nTrump\u2019s Fox News debate boycott marks the Trump has threatened to pull out of a debate (though he has showed up to all of them so far). But Trump the only candidate who\u2019s toyed with the idea, and one candidate actually beat Trump to it.\n\nAfter failing to qualify for the main debate, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul skipped the undercard round hosted by Fox Business News and Facebook on Jan. 16. \"I won\u2019t participate in anything that\u2019s not first-tier because we have a first-tier campaign,\" Paul .\n\nPaul\u2019s self-extraction from the earlier debate isn\u2019t quite the same thing as Trump, the front runner, pulling out of the prime time event in Iowa days before the Iowa caucuses. But Paul isn\u2019t the only other example, and Trump isn\u2019t the only leading candidate to have refused to debate.\n\nThere were 20 GOP primary debates in 2012. (The Democrats did not have any, given President Barack Obama\u2019s incumbency.) Eventual Republican nominee Mitt Romney was invited to the first Republican debate on May 5, 2011, before he announced his candidacy, but Romney .\n\nSimilarly, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman declined an invitation for the second debate held June 13, 2011, by CNN and announced his candidacy the following day. Huntsman then another CNN debate to attend a town hall forum instead.\n\nFive out of seven Republican candidates (Romney, Huntsman, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann and Texas Rep. Ron Paul) bowed out of a Newsmax debate scheduled for Dec. 27, 2011, \u2014 with Trump as the moderator.\n\nWhile the others cited conflicting schedules or didn\u2019t say why they were declining, the Ron Paul campaign specifically Trump himself as the reason, saying, \"Mr. Trump\u2019s participation will contribute to an unwanted circus-like atmosphere.\"\n\nOnly former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Kentucky Sen. Rick Santorum accepted the invitation. The debate was cancelled after Trump from moderating. (Trump to air his grievances.)\n\nIn 2008, four leading Republican candidates \u2014 Arizona Sen. John McCain, Romney, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson \u2014 a primary debate held Sept. 27, 2007, by PBS, citing conflicting schedules.\n\nA few months later, Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., a Univision debate because \"a Spanish debate has no place in a presidential campaign,\" he said.\n\nIn the Democratic primary, Obama, then a U.S. senator from Illinois, Hillary Clinton, then a U.S. senator from New York, and former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards to participate in a Sept. 23, 2007, debate hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus and Fox News.\n\nThe three said they would participate in a CNN debate co-sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus instead, with an Obama spokesman noting that \"CNN seemed like a more appropriate venue.\" The debate was .\n\nNew Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson in a radio-only debate hosted by NPR in December 2007 in order to attend the funeral of a Korean war veteran.\n\nBeyond the more recent cycles, there are even more examples of major candidates declining to debate in both primary and general elections.\n\n\"It\u2019s not unprecedented for frontrunners to skip out in primary debates,\" said Mitchell McKinney, a University of Missouri professor of political communication who specializes in presidential debates. McKinney gave a few other examples of no-shows.\n\nIn 1980, Ronald Reagan passed on the last debate before the Iowa caucus, thinking he had the state in the bag. However, he lost the caucus to George H.W. Bush, who had a strong performance.\n\nIn 1996, Bob Dole the first primary debate in order to campaign. And in 1999, then Texas Gov. George W. Bush was absent for the primary debates. (He had planned to skip all the debates until January 2000 but began participating in December due to falling poll numbers and pressure from the party, .)\n\nEven further back, there\u2019s also Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson (who refused to debate Barry Goldwater in 1964) and Richard Nixon (who, after debating and losing to John F. Kennedy in 1960, opted out in 1968 and 1972), according to Ohio University\u2019s William Benoit, who\u2019s authored several books on presidential debates.\n\nTo debate or not to debate\n\nSo Trump\u2019s decision to skip the Fox News debate, while rare, isn\u2019t unique. And what\u2019s more, experts said, bowing out is an old strategy for moving forward.\n\n\"Candidates who lead may not want to risk making a blunder in the debate,\" Benoit said. \"Occasionally a candidate in the primary will skip a debate; for example a candidate who knows he or she will lose in Iowa might skip one or more Iowa debates to concentrate on New Hampshire.\"\n\nUnlike other candidates who choose not to participate, Kinney argues, Trump doesn\u2019t have to fear losing exposure (given his knack for garnering media attention) or being accused of weakness (given his blustery, aggressive brand).\n\n\"This Megyn Kelly (spat) has obviously been ongoing, but honestly it could be cover,\" he said. \"To use that to dodge attacks from anyone else on that stage \u2014 since frontrunners are in line of fire \u2014 it\u2019s pretty smart.\"\n\nFox News said Donald Trump\u2019s decision to skip its upcoming debate in Des Moines \"is near unprecedented.\"\n\nFox takes its claim a bit too far, as we found many examples in recent cycles of candidates skipping primary debates and in some cases even sitting out debate for a year at a time. The clearest comparison to Trump happened with Reagan about 35 years ago. However, the news channel has a point that the Trump situation is pretty uncommon.", "lang": "en"}
