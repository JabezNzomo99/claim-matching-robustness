The pols are grossly incompetent, spend the money foolishly or corruptly, & only take from USA \u2026. The best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico is President Donald J. Trump. So many wonderful people, but with such bad Island leadership and with so much money wasted. Cannot continue to hurt our Farmers and States with these massive payments, and so little appreciation!\u201d (Pair of tweets, April 2)\n\nThe president gets many things wrong in this pair of tweets. Puerto Rico so far has only received over $11 billion out of nearly $41 billion in funds that have been appropriated. As we have detailed before, Trump\u2019s $91 billion figure includes $50 billion in additional estimated liabilities that could emerge over the next 20 years, but that\u2019s a figure subject to change. Trump suggests that the money has already been received but that\u2019s simply wrong. By the end of fiscal year 2019, the Federal Emergency Management Agency estimates, Puerto Rico will have received about $21 billion.\n\nAxios reported in November that Trump became furious after reading an article in the Wall Street Journal that said \u201cPuerto Rico bond prices soared . . . after the federal oversight board that runs the U.S. territory\u2019s finances released a revised fiscal plan that raises expectations for disaster funding and economic growth.\u201d Aides suggested that the president misinterpreted the article and concluded that island officials were using disaster funds to pay down debt. But neither Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 nor a federal board that oversees the territory\u2019s finances has argued that federal disaster relief funds should be used to directly pay off debts. Rossell\u00f3 and other local leaders have actively advocated against such a move.\n\nBut maybe he does mind. On April 2, Trump brought up old comments from Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who opposed the full release of independent counsel Kenneth Starr\u2019s report on President Bill Clinton\u2019s affair with Monica Lewinsky. \u201cIt\u2019s grand jury material. It represents statements which may or may not be true by various witnesses. Salacious material. All kinds of material that it would be unfair to release,\u201d Nadler said in 1998, as The Post\u2019s Colby Itkowitz reported.", "lang": "en"}
