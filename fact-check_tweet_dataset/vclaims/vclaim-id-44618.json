Portions of protests devolved into mayhem, with some people looting stores and burning buildings, including a police station. A video showing a man smashing the windows of an AutoZone shop also started to circulate on social media.\n\nThe video seemed suspicious to many social media users. Why was this man carrying an umbrella on a sunny day in May? Why was he dressed head to toe in black? Why was this white man, in the middle of a protest about racial injustice, casually smashing the windows of an AutoZone?\n\nThe video began to be spread with the additional claim that the man was actually a police officer, not a protester, and that he was purposefully causing property damage as a way to incite demonstrators to violence. As the video went viral, some social media users claimed they had identified the man in the video as a police officer named Jacob Pederson.\n\nTwitter user Dylan (@dyllyp) appears to have been the first to \u201cconfirm\u201d the man\u2019s identity:\n\n@dyllyp also shared a purported screenshot of a text message conversation the user allegedly had with a \u201cclose friend\u201d who knew the person in the video:\n\nThe image of this text conversation was later shared by other social media users with the claim that @dyllyp\u2019s \u201cclose friend\u201d was Pederson\u2019s ex-wife:\n\nWe reached out to @dyllyp for more information about the identity of the person in the text message but have yet to receive a response.\n\nThe St. Paul Police Department denied that officer Pederson was the man in the video. The police department issued a statement on Twitter calling the rumor \u201cfalse\u201d and claiming that \u201cthe person in the video is not our officer.\u201d\n\nWe are aware of the social media post that erroneously identifies one of our officers as the person caught on video breaking windows in Minneapolis. We\u2019ve seen it. We\u2019ve looked into it. And it\u2019s false. So we also want to be perfectly clear about this: The person in the video is not our officer. We don\u2019t know who that person is, but we hope he\u2019s identified and held accountable for his actions. Our officer? He\u2019s been working hard, keeping people and property safe, and protecting the right to peacefully assemble. It\u2019s sad that people would post and share this untrue information, adding more confusion to an already painful time in our community.\n\nOn June 7, 2020, the Saint Paul Police Department released more information about Pederson\u2019s whereabouts during the incident, including a surveillance video which supposedly showed the officer at another location at the time the Autozone windows were smashed.\n\n\u201cWe knew right away that our officer was not involved in instigating the unrest in Minneapolis because we knew exactly where he was at the time\u2014and he was in Saint Paul. Unfortunately, some people continue to spread the lie\u2014either out of genuine concern, a lack of knowledge about the situation, or maliciousness\u2014so we\u2019ve taken the extraordinary step of releasing the video that shows exactly where the officer was. \u201cThis type of disinformation can jeopardize the officer\u2019s reputation and safety and chip away at the trust this police department has worked so hard to build with its community.\u201d\n\nAs it stands, scant evidence exists to support the claim that the man seen in the video dressed in black and smashing the windows of an AutoZone was Pederson, or indeed that it was even a police officer. For starters, the person\u2019s face in the video is covered by a mask that simply makes him impossible to identify. We\u2019ve also seen dozens of similar rumors over the years that misidentified people because they had a passing resemblance to another person. Just this week, we saw rumors that falsely identified Derek Chauvin, the officer identified as kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck before he died, as a man at a rally for U.S. President Donald Trump, and as a man wearing a \u201cMake Whites Great Again\u201d hat.\n\nThe evidence to support the claim that he is a police officer named Jacob Pederson is scant, and the St. Paul Police Department has issued a statement denying that one of its officers is seen in this video. However, as the identify of the \u201cumbrella man\u201d in this video is still unknown, we can\u2019t rule out that this person was a different undercover police officer and have therefore marked this article as unproven.", "lang": "en"}
