The photos have been shared alongside a claim accusing Hong Kong water company Watsons Water, as well as the founder of its parent company, property tycoon Li Ka-shing, for supporting students who participated in the 2019 pro-democracy protests. The images have been shared in a misleading context; Watsons Water confirmed the bottled water belonged to one of its limited-edition runs that was on the market between May 2018 and March 2019, before the pro-democracy protests began in June 2019.\n\nThese side-by-side photos have been shared more than 2,500 times after being published on Facebook on December 17, 2019.\n\nThe photos purport to show a water bottle from different angles. The image on the left shows the Chinese characters for \u201csuccess\u201d at the top of the label being circled in red, and those for \u201cin exchange for limited edition prize\u201d and \u201ccheer Hong Kong students on\u201d at the bottom being circled in orange.\n\nThe image on the right shows another side of the label featuring the logo of Watsons Water, a Hong Kong water company owned by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing's conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings.\n\nThe traditional Chinese-language caption translates to English as: \u201c[Li Ka-shing cheers students on]\n\nThe Chinese characters for \u201csuccess\u201d, when flipped 180 degree, can be read as \u201cadd oil\u201d, which according to this Oxford English Dictionary definition, is a common Chinese expression used to show encouragement.\n\n\u201cHong Kongers, add oil!\u201d is a popular slogan often chanted by pro-democracy protesters, as reported by AFP here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe images were also posted here, here, here and here on Facebook, here on Twitter, and here and here on Weibo alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe posts were published in December 2019, during Hong Kong\u2019s seventh consecutive month of pro-democracy protests. A New Year\u2019s Day democracy rally prompted mass arrests and clashes between police and demonstrators, AFP reported here on January 1, 2020.\n\nThe images have been shared in a misleading context; Watsons Water has confirmed the photos show a limited-edition bottled water that was on the market between May 2018 and March 2019 -- before the pro-democracy protests began in Hong Kong in June 2019.\n\nThe photos in the misleading posts show traditional Chinese-language text highlighted in blue at the bottom of the label.\n\nTranslated to English, the text states: \u201cBeacon College commissioned Mr. Issei Nomura to create this ambigram to cheer Hong Kong students on.\u201d\n\nBeacon College is a Hong Kong cram school that helps students prepare for public examinations.\n\nIssei Nomura is a Japanese artist specialised in ambigrams, which are words or phrases that carry more than one meaning when viewed from different angles.\n\nReverse image and keyword searches on Google led to this Facebook post published by Watsons Water on May 16, 2018.\n\nThe seven-second clip in the post shows an identical bottled water with a camouflage label, in either blue or green, as well as a message at the end that states: \u201cWatsons Water joins hands with Beacon College to cheer Hong Kong students on!\u201d\n\nThe traditional Chinese-language caption of the post translates to English as: \u201c[Add oil, always! Succeed and break boundary!]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not easy to be a student in Hong Kong, so Watsons Water has joined hands with Beacon College to roll out a brand new packaging design for our bottled water and cheer you on!\n\n\u201cThe packaging includes an ambigram created by Japanese artist Issei Nomura. Turning the bottle upside down, the characters for \u2018success\u2019 become \u2018add oil\u2019!\n\n\u201cWe hope all Hong Kong students can carry the same spirit, add oil, break boundary, work towards your dream!\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Watsons Water Facebook post:\n\nAFP found the same video in this Beacon College Facebook post also published on May 16, 2019, alongside a similar caption.\n\nArtist Issei Nomura tweeted about the bottled water in this Japanese-language Twitter post on May 17, 2018.\n\nThe caption translates to English as: \u201cAn ambigram of \u2018add oil\u2019 - \u2018success\u2019 was produced at the request of Beacon College, and in collaboration with Watsons Water. It seems that they are already sold in store. Amazing!\u201d\n\nWatsons Water issued a clarification regarding the packaging issue in this Weibo post on December 17, 2019.\n\nThe post\u2019s simplified Chinese caption, translated to English, states: \u201cIt has come to our attention that there is a misunderstanding over the 2018 packaging design of Watsons Water. The design was part of a one-off, limited-edition run only available in Hong Kong, China, in 2018.\n\n\u201cWe hereby reiterate that the design and promotion were part of a 2018 marketing campaign, which ended in March 2019. The idea behind the design was to encourage students who were facing exams and to help them relieve stress. We hope relevant individuals and platforms would stop spreading untrue remarks.\u201d\n\nAn image of a statement that carries the same message was also included in the Weibo post, as seen in the screenshot below:\n\nIn addition, Watsons Water stated in this Facebook comment on December 17, 2019, that the bottle design was created for students who were going to take the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination (HKDSE), the city\u2019s university entrance examination.\n\nThe traditional Chinese-language caption translates to English states: \u201cThank you for your inquiry. This design for our bottled water was rolled out in May 2018 in support of HKDSE students. It belonged to a one-off, limited-edition run.\n\n\u201cThese designs, pictures and promotional materials were part of a 2018 marketing campaign, which ended in March 2019. Thanks again for your support.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of Watsons Water\u2019s comment:\n\nYoung people, many still in school, form the vast majority of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protesters, according to this August 2019 AFP report.\n\nThe ongoing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong began in June 2019, AFP reported here.\n\nStatistics published by the Hong Kong government here on December 4, 2019, show 66 percent of the people arrested in connection to the protests between June 9 and November 30, 2019, were aged between 18 and 30.\n\nThe government press release states in part: \u201cAs at November 21, the Police arrested a total of 5 856 persons, aged between 11 and 83.\n\n\u201cThe offences involved include \u2018riot\u2019, \u2018unlawful assembly\u2019, \u2018wounding\u2019, \u2018assault occasioning actual bodily harm\u2019, \u2018arson\u2019, \u2018criminal damage\u2019, \u2018in possession of offensive weapons\u2019, \u2018assaulting police officer\u2019, \u2018obstructing a police officer in the execution of his duty\u2019, etc.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the relevant statistics, circled in red by AFP:", "lang": "en"}
