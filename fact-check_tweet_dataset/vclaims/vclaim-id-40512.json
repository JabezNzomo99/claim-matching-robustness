The misattribution likely stems from Carnegie quoting Franklin in close proximity to the saying.\n\nThis Facebook post attempts to use the quote, featured along with a photoshopped image of Franklin wearing a \u201cMake Our Government Great Again\u201d hat, to promote unity in American politics.\n\nThe purported saying is just one of the many quotes attributed to Franklin, inventor of the lightning rod and one of the nation\u2019s best known founders. However, a quick Google search shows this quote actually belongs to Carnegie, the American author who wrote \u201cHow to Win Friends and Influence People.\u201d (RELATED: Did Benjamin Franklin Say, \u2018We Are All Born Ignorant, But One Must Work Hard To Remain Stupid\u2019?)\n\nSince its original publication in 1936, the self-help book has been sold to millions of readers worldwide. It\u2019s also the source for the misattributed quote.\n\nThe book holds up successful men as role models and quotes Franklin just a line above the phrase in question. \u201cThe secret of his success? \u2018I will speak ill of no man,\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2026 and speak all the good I know of everybody,'\u201d wrote Carnegie. \u201cAny fool can criticize, condemn and complain \u2013 and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.\u201d\n\nThe misattribution likely comes from the close proximity of these lines. \u201cThis \u2018don\u2019t criticize, condemn, or complain\u2019 trio is the starting point for many Carnegie seminars to this day,\u201d Blaine McCormick, a professor at Baylor University and author of \u201cBen Franklin: America\u2019s Original Entrepreneur,\u201d told The Daily Caller in an email.", "lang": "en"}
