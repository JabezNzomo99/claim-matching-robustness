She does so with her hand over her heart\u201d\n\nTlaib, the first Palestinian-American woman elected to Congress, did wear a keffiyeh on the House floor Dec. 6, while delivering remarks against House Resolution 326, which promotes a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But, contrary to the post\u2019s claim, the keffiyeh does not symbolize the Islamic State.\n\nThe keffiyeh actually represents \u201ca solidarity with the Palestinian people,\u201d said University of Northern Iowa political science professor Evan Renfro, according to The Associated Press. \u201cThere\u2019s no connotation with terrorism.\u201d\n\nThe red-and-white keffiyeh, PolitiFact reported, is often associated with Islamic militant group Hamas, while the black-and-white version connects more to Fatah, a nationalist group that has renounced armed violence. Keffiyeh-inspired fashion designs have been worn by people around the world, according to The Guardian.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Tlaib has worn traditional Palestinian clothing. In January 2019, she wore a traditional Palestinian gown to her swearing in to the House of Representatives, reported CNN.", "lang": "en"}
