The university, which enrolled about 12,300 students in fall 2015, is in Hunt County, which Trump carried with 76 percent of the vote to Clinton\u2019s 20 percent.\n\nAnd according to I Am A Texan, the letter offered counseling services to students with election-related stress, \"outlining all the ways that the university was prepared to help its fragile students who can\u2019t bear the thought of living now that Donald Trump has won the election.\"\n\nAdministrator: No intent to focus on fears of Trump\n\nAnd did the university spell out ways for students to deal with fears of Trump?\n\nTo get a fix on that, we reached out to Tom\u00e1s Aguirre, the university's assistant vice president and dean of students; Aguirre\u2019s digital signature was stamped on the email that included the attached letter.\n\nBy phone, Aguirre confirmed the authenticity of the posted email, which was blank save this subject line: \"An Open Letter to Students: How to De-Stress from Election.\"\n\nAguirre also insisted there was no administration intent to focus on students fearful of the president-elect, who was not mentioned in the letter.\n\nWe also emailed Miller\u2019s office, and got a phone call in response from spokesman Todd Smith, who said, \"Who else would they be offering emotional counseling to if not people opposed to Donald Trump being president?\" Smith\u2019s point: Trump fans would have been happy--not in need of counseling--after election day.\n\n\"Commissioner Miller believes that the mere fact that college students need counseling after a presidential election is a sad commentary on the state of our nation and many of its young people,\" Smith said. \"Commissioner Miller thinks they\u2019re a bunch of wusses.\"\n\nSo exactly what offer did the university make?\n\nBy email, Aguirre sent us a copy of the original \"open letter,\" pictured below, which he said was emailed to students on Nov. 10, 2016.\n\nThe letter doesn\u2019t mention Trump or any candidate by name.\n\nIt opens by calling the national election cycle \"a particularly stressful one.\" Next, it says the Counseling Center staff \"wants to acknowledge a range of reactions you might be experiencing Including excitement, joy, relief, fear, sadness, anger, dread, hopelessness, anxiety, and numbness.\"\n\nThe letter\u2019s second paragraph opens: \"We are here to listen and support you as our nation works through this election transition.\" It goes on to offer services especially to students \"struggling with the impact of the election or the tone of the national discussion\" and students who have experienced negative treatment because of \"race or ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, religious affiliation, country of origin or other aspects of your identity.\"\n\nThe letter closes with tips for students at \"this highly emotional time for our nation\" to remain productive. That comes after a sentence stating the center \"provides a safe space for discussions on identity, empowerment, intercultural competency, and the impact of the election.\"\n\nBy phone, Aguirre described the letter as a reminder of services available year-round. Also, he said, it was similar to letters distributed to students through the school year such as at mid-term exams and around Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nAguirre said he put the letter in motion after the election because the school\u2019s Counseling Center had seen an uptick in student visits during the fall 2016 semester. Aguirre said, though, that he he didn\u2019t know if the spike related to the election; confidentiality constraints bar the university from saying why students seek counseling.\n\nWe wondered if students saw eye to eye with Aguirre regarding the undertones of the open letter. So we messaged the Facebook page for the College Republicans at Texas A&M University - Commerce, and got a response from Michael Faz, the group\u2019s vice president.\n\nFaz, a senior majoring in political science, said by phone that Aguirre \"sends those emails out all the time,\" up to a few times a month. Faz said he read the letter himself but doubted that most students did. The College Republicans on campus, Faz said, did not feel the reminder of support services was a message catered to students fearful of Trump.\n\n\"We didn\u2019t think anything of it,\" Faz said.\n\nMiller posted an article saying Texas A&M University - Commerce was offering counseling and \"safe spaces for students who are afraid of President-elect Trump.\"\n\nAfter the election, the university sent a letter to students describing its counseling center as a \"safe space.\" Yet that letter didn\u2019t specifically mention Trump while offering services for students experiencing varied reactions.\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
