The first announcement covered the domains of direct taxation, relief for discoms; micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs);provident funds and housing finance corporation and non-banking financial corporation.\n\n\n\nThe government is hoping that these measures will simulate the economy, as well as enhance self-sufficiency and localisation within the Indian economy.\n\nApart from the tax relief given on TDS and TCS, the government said that it would also clear all refunds to charitable trusts, and non-corporate businesses & professions (LLPs, co-operatives, partnerships) immediately.\n\nEarlier in March, the government had announced that for firms with less than 100 employees, they would pay the employer's share and the employee's contribution to the public provident fund, for March, April and May. The government is extending this for June, July and August. Further, the government has reduced the statutory contribution to the PF from 12% to 10%.
