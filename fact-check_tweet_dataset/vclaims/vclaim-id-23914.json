The meme alleges that Russian journalists, by contrast, were allowed in the room.\n\n\u201cWell sure. Putin knows his media will only say what he tells them to say, and Trump knows our media will tell THE TRUTH,\u201d reads the meme. \u201cHe can\u2019t let that happen!\u201d\n\nA standard contingent of American journalists was present before the bilateral meeting between Trump and Putin, according to a member of the press pool who attended.\n\nTrump and Putin met during the 14th G20 summit, a forum for the leaders of 19 countries and the European Union that collectively make up nearly 75 percent of global trade. The 2019 summit, held in Osaka, Japan, focused on themes including innovation and women\u2019s empowerment. The two leaders last held a formal meeting in July 2018 at a summit in Helsinki, Finland.\n\nThe meeting in Osaka received attention after Trump jokingly urged Putin not to meddle in the 2020 election in response to a journalist who asked if Trump would press him on that issue.
