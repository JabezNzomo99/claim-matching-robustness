Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral claim is false.\n\nA viral video on social media is shared with a caption that reads: 3 \u0926\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0916\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0938\u0947 72 \u0918\u0902\u091f\u0947 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0939\u094b \u091c\u093e\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0932\u093e\u0938\u094d\u091f \u0938\u094d\u091f\u0947\u091c \u0915\u0948\u0902\u0938\u0930 \u092d\u0940 \u091c\u0921\u093c \u0938\u0947 \u0916\u0924\u094d\u092e | canser ka ilaaj. (English: Eating 3 grains can cure last stage cancer in 72 hours). In the viral video, it has been claimed that last stage cancer can be cured in 72 hours by consuming a home-made mixture made of walnut, sprouted grains, honey, garlic, and lemon. As per the video, the mixture needs to be stored in the fridge and eaten multiple times a day.\n\nThe video has 107,733 views on Youtube so far.\n\nVishvas News started its investigation by going through the comments of the video. Upon reading the comments we found that many users commented that the video is fake.\n\nWe read the caption of the video carefully and the spelling of cancer was mis-spelt.\n\nWe further investigated whether diet has got anything to do with cancer prevention and treatment. We found a report on the website of the American Institute of Cancer research which states \u201cno single food or food component can protect you against cancer by itself. But research shows that a diet filled with a variety of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans and other plant foods help lower risk for many cancers.\u201d\n\nWe also spoke to Dr. Vimal N., an Ayurveda doctor. He said: \u201cThis combination does not work for cancer treatment. And this is completely fake news.\u201d\n\nA video claiming that cancer can be cured in 72 hours by consuming mixture made of walnut, sprouted grains, garlic, honey, and lemon is fake.", "lang": "en"}
