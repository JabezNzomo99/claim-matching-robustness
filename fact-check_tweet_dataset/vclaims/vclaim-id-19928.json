However, European customers have taken Gazprom to court, and the European Union launched an antitrust case against it. Gazprom customers have characterized the company as an \u201ceconomic blackmailer\u201d and an \u201cunreliable supplier.\u201d", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "June 01, 2017", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-19928", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/gazprom-russia-eu-antitrust-investigation/28523245.html", "vclaim": "The Russian government holds a majority stake in Gazprom, which produces, transports and distributes natural gas domestically and abroad.\n\nIn a speech to the Annual International Business Congress in Vienna, Austria, on May 25, Gazprom CEO Alexey Miller stressed the advantages of natural gas versus clean energy. He also described his company as a reliable business partner and one of the major forces boosting global economy.\n\n\u201dWhen Gazprom\u2019s consumers send us a request for gas offtake, they can be absolutely sure that they will receive that gas at the delivery point, right on time and in the amount agreed upon between the parties,\u201d Miller said.\n\nMiller\u2019s description of Gazprom, however, differs from how the company is viewed by customer-countries and experts.\n\n\u201cThis, of course, is an outrageous lie and a standard one,\u201d Anders \u00c5slund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told Polygraph.info.\n\n\u201cAll along, Gazprom has claimed that they are impeccably reliable, while they have cut gas supplies repeatedly to all East European countries, notably in January 2006 and January 2009, which prompted the EU Third Energy Package,\u201d he said.\n\nThe EU Third Energy Package is legislation adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union in 2009. It is aimed at regulating and diversifying Europe\u2019s gas and electricity market.\n\nThe legislation was initiated after Gazprom repeatedly cut off supplies to multiple European countries in the middle of winter.\n\nIn September 2012, the European Commission launched an antitrust investigation of Gazprom involving eight EU countries. Lithuania stepped forward as a whistleblower in the case.\n\nAfter more than six years of investigation, Gazprom pledged to comply with the requirements of the EU competition law.\n\nHowever, the antitrust investigation is ongoing, with member-countries urging the EU Commission to take a \u201ctough\u201d stance against Gazprom.\n\nOn May 30, Poland\u2019s state-run energy firm PGNiG (Polish Oil and Gas Company) described Gazprom as an \u201cunreliable supplier\u201d and the gas giant\u2019s policies as \u201cexploitation\u201d and \u201ceconomic blackmail.\n\nIn June 2014, Gazprom and Ukraine\u2019s Naftogaz lodged multi-billion-dollar claims against each other with a Stockholm arbitration court that resolves commercial disputes. On May 31, Naftogaz claimed victory in the case against Gazprom.\n\nEarlier this week, Norway, a country that has maintained broad economic ties with Russia despite the Western sanctions targeting Moscow for actions against Ukraine, announced it is seeking greater scope to restrict foreign ownership of offshore resources. Observers say the move may be in response to Russia\u2019s growing interest in Norway\u2019s Arctic oil and gas fields.", "lang": "en"}
