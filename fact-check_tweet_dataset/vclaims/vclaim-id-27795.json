While the Sun article didn\u2019t directly quote him as saying that, to describe the speech (which was mostly discussing warning signs of a global economic slowdown) in that way is misleading.\n\nOn Brexit, Mr Carney actually said: \u201cIn many respects, Brexit is the first test of the new global order and could prove the acid test of whether a way can be found to broaden the benefits of openness while enhancing democratic accountability.\n\n\u201cBrexit can lead to a new form of international cooperation and cross-border commerce built on a better balance of local and supranational authorities.\n\n\u201cIn these respects, Brexit could affect both the short and long term global outlooks so it's in the interests of everyone, arguably everywhere [\u2026] that a Brexit solution is found that works for all.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
