There is no military draft, and immigrants \u2014 including those in the country illegally \u2014 are already required to register with the Selective Service.\n\nThe recent conflict between the U.S. and Iran heightened fears about a potential war \u2014 and with it came elevated interest in the topic of a military draft. The U.S. Army Recruiting Command, for example, warned of a text message hoax \u201cinforming individuals they have been selected for a military draft.\u201d\n\nThere is no draft \u2014 which would require Congress to pass legislation, and President Donald Trump to sign it. There has not been a military draft since 1973.\n\nOn Facebook, a popular meme distorts the facts about that to make a political point about illegal immigration.\n\n\u201cIllegals crossing back into Mexico after Trump makes illegals eligible for the WW3 draft,\u201d reads the text, above a photo of several individuals walking toward a border fence. A page called \u201cThe Hispanic Conservative\u201d shared the meme, which contains a logo for its page, before it was shared elsewhere.\n\nThe meme may be someone\u2019s idea of a joke, but it contains false information about U.S. military service. Not only there is there no draft currently, but male immigrants \u2014 regardless of their immigration status \u2014 are already legally required to register with the Selective Service System, if they are at least 18 and younger than 26.\n\nThe Selective Service System, a federal agency, maintains a database of adult men who could be tapped if a national emergency were to compel the U.S. to implement a draft. President Jimmy Carter in 1980 resumed Selective Service registration after a hiatus. There is no exception for immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.\n\n\u201cWith very few exceptions, all males between ages 18 and 25 must register with the Selective Service System (SSS) within 30 days of arriving in the United States,\u201d the Selective Service notes. \u201cThis includes U.S. born and naturalized citizens, parolees, undocumented immigrants, legal permanent residents, asylum seekers, refugees, and all males with visas of any kind which expired more than 30 days ago.\u201d\n\nThere are potential penalties for failing to register, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services notes that an immigrant\u2019s failure to do so could affect his application to naturalize as U.S. citizen before the age of 31.\n\nSome Facebook users appeared to believe the meme\u2019s suggestion that immigrants in the country illegally are not eligible for the draft. \u201cI wish,\u201d one wrote. Another: \u201cFANTASTIC IDEA!!!!\u201d\n\nWe used reverse image searches to trace the picture used in the meme; it\u2019s actually a Getty Images picture that shows Central American migrants approaching a U.S.-Mexico border fence in El Paso, Texas, in February 2019. They were seeking political asylum in the U.S., not leaving it.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
