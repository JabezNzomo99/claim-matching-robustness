As we have noted before, Obama\u2019s claim at the time was quickly criticized by fact checkers, including The Fact Checker, as dubious and unrealistic. Moreover, the pledge came with a very large asterisk: He was not saying premiums would fall by $2,500, but that health-care costs per person would be that much lower than anticipated.\n\nFirst, the report Portman referenced was not a CBO estimate of the actual law as passed, but an earlier Senate version in 2009. The CBO has not done a similar estimate for the law, but in this case said that in 2016 average premiums for family policies would be $15,200, compared to $13,100 under the pre-Obamacare law. That\u2019s how Portman comes up with an increase of $2,100.\n\nFinally, as Table 1 in the report makes clear, there are a variety of factors that affect the premium estimate. The biggest reason for an increase in premiums is that the law mandates a comprehensive package of benefits \u2014 benefits that many plans in the individual market previously lacked. So that increase in insurance coverage boosts the premium of nongroup plans by about 30 percent, but the impact is negligible for large group plans, which already provided many of those benefits.\n\nFinally, Portman says that Ohio premiums are 41 percent higher because of the Affordable Care Act. This statistic comes from a news release quoting the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, who makes it clear she is a foe of the law. The news release says individual exchange plan premiums are expected to increase an \u201caverage\u201d of 41 percent in 2014, compared to 2013.\n\n\u201cThe reason we went with this approach is that we were trying to look at things from the standpoint of someone who doesn\u2019t have coverage today because high premiums are a barrier,\u201d said Avik Roy, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. \u201cAll of the market research that has been done on the exchanges has shown that consumers are extremely sensitive to the price of premiums, and that their decision to purchase insurance is largely driven by premium costs. Hence, if someone is uninsured today because premiums are too high, the question of whether or not that person buys insurance in the future is also going to be driven by the lowest-priced plans available.\u201d\n\nThe Manhattan Institute also adjusts pre-law prices to take into account people who could not get those low rates due to their worse health status. Finally, Roy noted that a large number of insurers chose to participate in the Ohio market, making possible a broad range of prices. That menu of options gets obscured in the straight-line average of the Ohio news release.\n\nUpdate: Generally, The Fact Checker prefers to rely on official documents, and Portman\u2019s spokeswoman, Caitlin Dunn, questioned why we would favor the work of an outside group rather than a study by the Ohio insurance commissioner. This is a fair point. In this case, the Manhattan Institute, which is no friend of the Affordable Care Act, produced a more sophisticated look at what is happening in the Ohio insurance market. But Dunn is correct that Portman did rely on an official document for this particular statistic and generally that is to be commended.\n\nBut he gets into trouble when he compares that figure to an out-of-date estimate and also cites a figure for premium rates in Ohio that, while official, appears overly simplistic. As it turns out, a think tank frequently cited by Republicans has concluded that Ohio has fared rather well in the post-Obamacare health-care world. Portman needs to update and amend his talking points.", "lang": "en"}
