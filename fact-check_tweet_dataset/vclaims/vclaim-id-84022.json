For PM Modi\u2019s 27th February rally in Mau, Uttar Pradesh, wheat farmers lost many acres of their crop as they had to prematurely harvest their crop. This issue was covered by ABP News, a video of which can be seen below.\n\nYet another video of the poorest of poorest losing their hutments was also circulated on social media a couple of weeks ago. In the video below, one can see how people are complaining about how their hutments, specifically those of the Muslim families, were demolished in order to accommodate PM Modi\u2019s rallies.\n\nBack in Feb 2016, for a PM Modi rally in Madhya Pradesh, a farmer was forced to cut down 15 acres of his standing wheat crop thus leading to losses.\n\nIn December 2016, several school children had to miss school because their school buses had to get busy for political duties of PM Modi\u2019s rally.\n\nA man who came to power with the slogan of \u2018Achhe Din\u2019 is bringing \u2018Bure Din\u2019 for the poor, farmers and students who live in the vicinity of his rallies, the very rallies in which he appeals to people to vote again for BJP for more \u2018Achhe Din\u2019.", "lang": "en"}
