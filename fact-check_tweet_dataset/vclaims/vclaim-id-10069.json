The story is fabricated.\n\nThe website france24-tv.com, which ran the story \u201cWe are Going to Put Duterte on Trial in January\u2014ICC,\u201d is imitating france24.com, website of international French television company France 24.\n\nAdding characters like \u201c-tv\u201d in the URL of news websites is a common trick employed by imposter sites, or websites masquerading as legitimate ones.\n\nFrance24-tv.com also possesses these telltale signs of a fake news site\u2014no bylines or author\u2019s names; no About Us and Contact Us sections. Per a domain name lookup service, the website was created only on Oct. 14. It ran its first story on Oct. 20.\n\nSought for comment, lawyer Ruben Carranza of the International Center for Transitional Justice said if the ICC prosecutor were to take a formal step, it would be called a \u201cpreliminary examination.\u201d\n\nMore, it would refer to a situation in a country rather than particular persons at that point, Carranza said.\n\nUpon checking, France 24 last ran a story on Duterte on Oct. 29 about his appointment of Rep. Harry Roque as presidential spokesperson.\n\n(Guided by the code of principles of the International Fact-Checking Network at Poynter, VERA Files tracks the false claims, flip-flops, misleading statements of public officials and figures, and debunks them with factual evidence.
