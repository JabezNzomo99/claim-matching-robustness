Gen. Don Bolduc, Messner\u2019s opponent in the GOP primary, misled reporters in New Hampshire into writing he was a member of the famous \u201chorse soldiers\u201d depicted in a Hollywood movie. He was one of the first Special Forces officers in Afghanistan but not part of the 12-man team that rode horses to victory.\n\nBut Messner, who has been endorsed by President Trump, has his own problem with how he touts his military credentials. In his ads and on his website, he describes himself as an Army Ranger. That\u2019s an elite unit within the military. As with Bolduc, the media has accepted the claim, describing him as \u201cformer Army Ranger Corky Messner.\u201d\n\nSimply put, there\u2019s the Ranger School, and there\u2019s the Ranger Regiment, a Special Operations unit. Anyone in the military can attend the Ranger School, whether or not they served in the Ranger Regiment. The Ranger School is an intense 62-day small-unit tactics course for dismounted infantry that only about 40 percent manage to complete. If a soldier makes it through the course, he or she earns the right to wear a uniform \u201ctab\u201d \u2014 a small cloth arch \u2014 that reads \u201cRanger.\u201d\n\nMessner graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in 1979 and rose to be a captain before leaving the army in 1984 to go to law school. He completed the Ranger course in the summer of 1977 \u2014 before he graduated at U.S. Military Academy, not afterward, as stated on the campaign website \u2014 and earned the right to wear the tab, but he was not part of the Ranger Regiment.\n\nWe posed the question to the Army, starting with the Ranger School at Fort Benning. We explained that a political candidate is running ads saying he is a former Army Ranger, but one of his rivals, also ex-Army, says he can\u2019t be considered a Ranger. Our query was passed up the line until we received this statement from a U.S. Army Special Operations Command spokesperson:\n\nThe U.S. Army Ranger Course is the Army's premier leadership school, and falls under Training and Doctrine Command, Fort Eustis, Virginia, and is open to all members of the military, regardless of whether they have served in the 75th Ranger Regiment or completed the Ranger Assessment and Selection Program. A graduate of the U.S. Army Ranger Course is Ranger qualified. The 75th Ranger Regiment is a special operations unit with the mission to plan and conduct joint special military operations in support of national policies and objectives. The Regiment\u2019s higher headquarters is the U.S. Army Special Operations Command located at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The Regiment is the Army\u2019s largest, joint special operations force. All members of the 75th Ranger Regiment have passed the Ranger Assessment Selection Program 1, 2, or both. Anyone who is serving or has served within the 75th Ranger Regiment is a U.S. Army Ranger.\n\nI served in the US Army until 1984, and during that service, there was never a question about graduates of Army Ranger School being Army Rangers. And during the 36 years since I left the Army, I was never questioned about referring to myself as an Army Ranger. That is, until a few months into my campaign for U.S. Senate.\n\nWhen I was first asked about this, I was surprised that this was even a question. Nonetheless, I decided to conduct research and wanted to gather as much information as possible to accurately represent my military service. So I contacted the Army Ranger Hall of Fame, spoke to fellow members, and reached out to other Army Rangers. More recently, I received the attached response from the US Army Ranger Association.\n\nBased upon the statements I have gathered and set forth below, it is clear that even recent retirees of the US Army, and a former commander of the Ranger Regiment, have views different than that of the statement you provided. As for the official statement you provided, one cannot expect to go through life adapting one\u2019s proud military service to the ever-changing designations currently used by the US Army.\n\nI am a proud member of the U.S. Army Ranger Association. Acceptance into the Association is limited to Rangers who have earned the U.S. Army Ranger tab, WWII Rangers, Korean War Rangers, Vietnam War Rangers, all Rangers who participated in Operations Urgent Fury, Just Cause, Desert Storm, Restore Hope, Enduring Freedom, and all Rangers who have served honorably for at least one year in a recognized Ranger unit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all a very subtle, nuanced thing within the Army,\u201d he said. \u201cShould he say he was \u2018Ranger-qualified\u2019 in his ads? Probably. Maybe.\u201d He noted that the Ranger community is very small, even those who earned the tab. He believed it would be more problematic if Messner specifically said he was part of the 75th Ranger Regiment \u2014 and we did not find evidence that is the case.", "lang": "en"}
