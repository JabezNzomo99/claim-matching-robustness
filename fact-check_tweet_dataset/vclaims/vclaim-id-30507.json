We rated that outdated claim Four Pinocchios: Not only is the United States not being hurt by China\u2019s current currency manipulation, China also is not devaluing its currency anymore. In fact, China is selling foreign currency to prop up its own in an effort to prevent the yuan from depreciating further and destabilizing the Chinese and global economy.\n\nWe\u2019ll first note these two things have nothing to do with each other. Trump repeatedly said he would release his federal tax returns once they are done being audited by the Internal Revenue Service. Nothing in law prohibits him from releasing his taxes while under audit. In fact, the first president to release his taxes, Richard M. Nixon, did so in the middle of an audit.\n\nHe said in interviews about releasing his tax returns: \u201cI have no problem and it should be and I hope it\u2019s before the election.\u201d (Here\u2019s Fact Checker\u2019s look at what we know about his taxes so far.)\n\nIn any case, he\u2019s incorrect that winning the electoral college was an \u201cimpossible thing to do for a Republican\u201d and his electoral college votes were not \u201ceasily won.\u201d According to a tally by John Pitney of Claremont McKenna College, Trump ranked 46th out of 58 electoral college results. (More on that here.)\n\nTrump keeps touting his successes in his first 90 days, but we\u2019ve found the evidence sorely lacking. As we\u2019ve written, few presidents achieve much on foreign policy matters in their first 100 days in office, as such policy advancements take time. Trump, so far, has been meeting with many foreign heads of state, but it\u2019s too early to say whether his policies will result in real changes.\n\nTrump tweeted several times leading up to and on the day of the April 18 special election in Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District, to fill the seat vacated by Tom Price, now the secretary of health and human services. Trump is referring to Jon Ossoff, who is headed to a runoff election with Republican Karen Handel.\n\nHe did not accurately describe Ossoff\u2019s stances on illegal immigration and taxes, as our friends at PolitiFact and FactCheck.org found. Ossoff supports a comprehensive immigration bill that allows a \u201cpath to legal status\u201d for undocumented people (excluding felons) living in the country. But he also said he supports strong border security. This is not the same as \u201callowing illegal immigration.\u201d\n\nMS-13 is believed to have started in Los Angeles in the 1980s by Salvadorans who immigrated there to flee civil war in their country, according to the Congressional Research Service. As of 2005, the gang had traveled to many cities across the country, from California to the East Coast. PolitiFact and FactCheck.org dug into this in depth.\n\nThe day after the Georgia special election, Trump took credit for the ensuing runoff election. He said he was \u201cglad to be of help,\u201d even though Republicans in the race distanced themselves from him as the election got closer. And while Republicans avoided an embarrassing loss, it wasn\u2019t exactly a BIG \u201cR\u201d win that Handel will face Ossoff in the runoff. Ossoff garnered 48 percent of the vote in a strong Republican district, just shy of the 50 percent needed for an outright win. Many pundits said the result indicated danger signs for Republican lawmakers in the Trump era.\n\nTrump had a long history of outsourcing a variety of his products and has acknowledged doing so. When asked during a Republican primary debate in Miami why voters should trust that Trump \u201cwill run the country differently from how you run your businesses,\u201d he answered: \u201cBecause nobody knows the system better than me. \u2026 I\u2019m a businessman. These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We\u2019re allowed to do it. \u2026 I\u2019m the one that knows how to change it.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
