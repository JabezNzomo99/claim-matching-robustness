Users also flagged a follow-up post on June 24 at WashingtonFeed.com that said Depp was in critical condition after suffering a cardiac arrest during his interrogation.\n\nThere\u2019s more to the entire saga, according to a number of posts that first appeared on June 22-23 at TheLastLineOfDefense.org.\n\nThe website said that Depp, who was taken into custody and held under the Patriot Act, later died from his heart malady, although not before recanting his faith in Islam on his deathbed.\n\nNone of this is real.\n\nTheLastLineOfDefense.org, which created the stories, is run by Christopher Blair. Blair has told us before that he fabricates absurd news posts in an attempt to fool conservative readers with his fake news. His site\u2019s About Us section noted that TheLastLineOfDefense.org \"is a satirical publication that may sometimes appear to be telling the truth\" \u2014 but it isn\u2019t.\n\nThe website has a history of writing multiple posts about far-out events involving famous personalities. It\u2019s published tales of U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy\u2019s fictional son being found dead, Tucker Carlson being assassinated in a car crash, Sarah Palin being run off the road and Ted Nugent faking his own death.\n\nThese contrived storylines, often barely keeping their own counterfeit details straight among the various posts, end up being passed around on other fake news websites, with no indication that they are made up.\n\nThat is again the case with Depp, who was not detained by the feds and did not die during questioning.\n\nWe rate this series of fake posts Pants On Fire!", "lang": "en"}
