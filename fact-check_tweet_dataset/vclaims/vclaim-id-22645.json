The claim is false; the video actually shows a street play staged by workers for India\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in March 2018.\n\nThe video, which is two minutes, 39 seconds long, was posted to Facebook here on April 14, 2019. It has been viewed around 60,000 times and shared more than 1,600 times since.\n\nIt shows a woman wearing a white-and-blue sari being interviewed by a man with a microphone, surrounding by a jeering crowd. She can be heard saying in Bengali language:\n\n\"I will not tolerate any undue intervention from the central government. People in West Bengal will live their lives peacefully.\" West Bengal is a state in eastern India.\n\nLater in the video, the woman addresses a crowd of people, some of whom are wearing scarves and caps, which are symbols of Islam.\n\nShe says to them: \u201cI will give you everything. All the welfare projects will be diverted to you and only you.\u201d\n\nHundreds of thousands of Muslim Rohingya have fled Myanmar, according to the UN, and some now live in India. Here is an AFP report on Rohingya in India.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s English-language caption reads: \"Must watch.... Trinamul leader KAKOLI GHOSH DASTIDAR supports ROHINGYA Muslims unabashedly. Police also openly supports her.\n\n\"Says, will not allow RAM naam, Hari naam to be chanted. Openly threatens Reporter calling for cancellation of his licence. Where is West Bengal heading to....Shame on us.\"\n\n\"Trinamul\" refers to the All India Trinamool Congress (TMC), the ruling party in the eastern Indian state of Bengal. Here is the party\u2019s official Twitter page.\n\nKakoli Ghosh Dastidar is a TMC member of parliament, this is her verified Twitter profile. As reported by NDTV here, she is running for reelection in West Bengal in polls to be held on May 19 \u2013 part of India\u2019s six-week national election.\n\nAnd finally, \u201cRAM naam, Hari naam\u201d refers to the Hindu god Lord Rama.\n\nThe same clip was also also posted to Facebook alongside similar claims here, here and here.\n\nHowever the video does not show a speech by Dastidar; it actually shows a street play staged more than a year ago by members of India\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n\nThe woman in the video is actually Aditi Mukherjee, who describes herself on her Facebook profile here as the secretary of \u201cMohila Morcha\u201d, the women\u2019s wing of the BJP in West Bengal.\n\nMukherjee shared a full three minute, 26 second version of the video on Facebook here without a caption on April 24, 2018.\n\nThe exact same video was also published on Facebook here by another user called Sanghamitra Chaudhuri, who describes herself on her profile as the State Vice-President of the BJP women\u2019s wing in West Bengal.\n\nThe post, dated March 23, 2018, is embedded below. Its caption reads, in part: \u201cStreet play \u2018Infiltration\u2019 enacted at Red Road today. Organised by Bharatiya Janata Mahila and Yuva Morcha. With Locket Chatterjee. Aditi Mukherjee...\u201d\n\nThe caption also contains several other names, many of whom are also affiliated with the BJP, according to their Facebook pages.\n\nFor example, part of the caption says: \u201cVideo Courtesy: Abhijit Paul\u201d. On his Facebook page here, Paul says he is a BJP official.\n\nAnd in a second video published alongside the footage of the play by Chaudhuri, the man holding the microphone introduces himself as Jayanta Roy and says the group is standing at a refugee camp in Baruipur, a city in West Bengal.\n\nRoy shared Chaudhuri\u2019s post here on his Facebook page on March 24, 2018, with a comment that says, in English: \u201cJayonto the play was good congrats\u201d.\n\nThe image below contains three rows, comparing various close-up pictures of:\n\n1. The woman in the video in the misleading Facebook post\n\n 2. Aditi Mukherjee, the BJP activist\n\n 3. Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, the TMC politician\n\nThe photos of Mukherjee and Dastidar have been taken from publicly shared images on their Facebook and Twitter pages. Here is Dastidar\u2019s Facebook page.\n\nExamining the pictures closely shows that woman 1 and 2 are the same person, while woman 3 has a different face shape:\n\nThe play was mentioned by Indian newspaper The Tribune in this report dated May 7, 2018. The section in question says:\n\n\u201cThe BJP has alleged that one of its workers, Aditi Mukherjee, is being harassed by the police for playing Mamata Banerjee in a street play on the Rohingya issue.\n\n\u201cThe actress says she was asked by the CID to appear at the state police headquarters at Bhawani Bhawan. 'The Chief Minister likes to lambast the Central Government for destroying democracy. But look at the state of democracy in her own state,' remarked BJP\u2019s Shamik Bhattacharya.\u201d\n\nThe play was also mentioned in this diary column published May 12, 2018, in another Indian newspaper, the Sunday Guardian.", "lang": "en"}
