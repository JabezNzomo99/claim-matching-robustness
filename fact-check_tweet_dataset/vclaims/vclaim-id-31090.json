In practice, there is.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that this saying originated with Berra.\n\nThe only player in Major League Baseball history to win 10 World Series titles, Berra played catcher for the New York Yankees for 18 seasons.\n\nAside from his ball-playing skills, Berra is perhaps best known for his humorous non sequiturs called \u201cYogi-isms,\u201d which were eventually compiled into the 1998 book \u201cThe Yogi Book: I Really Didn\u2019t Say Everything I Said!\u201d (RELATED: Did Albert Einstein Say, \u2018Two Things Inspire Me To Awe \u2013 The Starry Heavens Above And The Moral Universe Within\u2019?)\n\nHowever, the quote appears nowhere in that book, or any of his others.\n\n\u201cAs to our knowledge, that quote is not in fact genuine,\u201d confirmed Nikki Morton of the Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nThe website Quote Investigator traced the earliest instance of the saying back to 1882, where it appeared in the Yale Literary Magazine. Benjamin Brewster, a student at Yale University, recounted a philosophical argument he had with a friend, writing, \u201cWhat does his lucid explanation amount to but this, that in theory there is no difference between theory and practice, while in practice there is?\u201d\n\nIn the 1980s, Walter Savitch included the quote \u2014 cited only as a \u201cremark overheard at a computer science conference\u201d \u2014 in his computer programming textbook, according to etymologist Barry Popik.\n\nA variation of this expression has also been attributed to theoretical physicist Albert Einstein.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
