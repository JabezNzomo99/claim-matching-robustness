He then realized they were suspects in the robbery he had heard on the police radio and backed his vehicle, an SUV, to stop them from walking any farther. Brown then reached through the open driver\u2019s window and punched and grabbed Wilson, according to the report.\n\nThere were numerous witnesses deemed credible by investigators. (Others were found not to be credible because their accounts were inconsistent or did not match the forensic evidence.) We will let their accounts, taken from the Justice Department report, tell the rest of the story. Some testified reluctantly, with one recounting signs on the street where Brown was shot that said: \u201csnitches get stitches.\u201d\n\nWitness 103, a 58-year-old black man: The witness \u201csaw Brown punching Wilson at least three times in the facial area, through the open driver\u2019s window of the SUV. Witness 103 described Wilson and Brown as having hold of each other\u2019s shirts, but Brown was \u2018getting in a couple of blows.\u2019 Wilson was leaning back toward the passenger seat with his forearm up, in an effort to block the blows. Then Witness 103 heard a gunshot and Brown took off running.\u201d\n\nWitness 104, a 26-year-old biracial woman: The witness \u201cheard two gunshots. She looked out the front window and saw Brown at the driver\u2019s window of Wilson\u2019s SUV. Witness 104 knew that Brown\u2019s arms were inside the SUV, but she could not see what Brown and Wilson were doing because Brown\u2019s body was blocking her view. Witness 104 saw Brown run from the SUV, followed by Wilson, who \u2018hopped\u2019 out of the SUV and ran after him while yelling, \u2018stop, stop, stop.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWitness 102: \u201cWilson then chased Brown with his gun drawn, but not pointed at Brown, until Brown abruptly turned around at a nearby driveway. Witness 102 explained that it made no sense to him why Brown turned around. Brown did not get on the ground or put his hands up in surrender. ... Brown made some type of movement similar to pulling his pants up or a shoulder shrug, and then \u2018charged\u2019 at Wilson.\u201d\n\nWitness 104: \u201cWilson did not fire his gun as Brown ran from him. Brown then turned around and \u2018for a second\u2019 began to raise his hands as though he may have considered surrendering, but then quickly \u2018balled up in fists\u2019 in a running position and \u2018charged\u2019 at Wilson. Witness 104 described it as a \u2018tackle run,\u2019 explaining that Brown \u2018wasn\u2019t going to stop.\u2019 Wilson fired his gun only as Brown charged at him, backing up as Brown came toward him.\u201d\n\nWitness 108, a 74-year-old black man: This man, a reluctant witness, confided to a friend that he \u201c'would have f------ shot that boy, too.\u2019 In saying so, Witness 108 mimicked an aggressive stance with his hands out in front of him, as though he was about to charge.\u201d He did not come forward to police, but detectives tracked him down and he reluctantly \"explained that Wilson told Brown to \u2018stop\u2019 or \u2018get down\u2019 at least ten times, but instead Brown \u2018charged\u2019 at Wilson.\u201d\n\nIn the report, Johnson is listed as Witness 101. In a recent interview with The Washington Post, he stood by his story that Brown had \u201cput his hands in the air\u201d but that Wilson approached him with his weapon drawn and shot him. The Justice Department report, citing witness statements, said Johnson did not appear to be in a position to see what happened because he fled as soon as the first shots were fired.\n\nThe report said the ballistics analysis showed that the officer \u201cfired a total of 12 shots, two from his vehicle and ten on the roadway,\u201d in \u201cthree gunshot volleys.\u201d The autopsy found Wilson\u2019s shots struck Brown \u201cas few as six or as many as eight times,\u201d killing him. But, the report said, \u201cThere is no credible evidence to refute Wilson\u2019s stated subjective belief that he was acting in self-defense.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
