One of the most viral of these articles appeared on websites known to publish misinformation in the past, such as ZeroHedge and Infowars, and was written by an anonymous person under the fictitious name of Tyler Durden.\n\nThe basis for this claim is a preprint of a research study uploaded to bioRXiV on 2 February 2020. The paper, titled \u201cUncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag\u201d, has not been peer reviewed and was soon withdrawn by the authors after the study received extensive criticism from other scientists.\n\nNevertheless, the paper\u2019s findings have been used by many on social media as evidence to support the baseless assertion that 2019-nCoV is a man-made virus. The authors had reported finding \u201c4 insertions in the spike glycoprotein (S) which are unique to 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses\u201d. The authors further asserted that \u201call of [these inserts] have identity/similarity to amino acids residues in key structural proteins of HIV-1 [which] is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature\u201d.\n\nHowever, the authors failed to check the similarity of the four insertions to the protein sequences of other organisms besides HIV, explained Aaron Irving, a virologist and senior research fellow at Duke-NUS Medical School. \u201cAs it turned out, the region is also homologous to many unrelated sequences\u201d, Irving said. \u201cAs such, the conclusions drawn from the data are no longer valid and there are many open-ended questions regarding this region highlighted.\u201d [See Irving\u2019s full comment below.]\n\nCriticism of the study\u2019s findings by experts have been published in several other outlets. In this Forbes article, Arinjay Banerjee, a postdoctoral fellow at McMaster University who has studied coronaviruses, said that:\n\nResearchers also took to Twitter to demonstrate this problem first-hand. Trevor Bedford, a faculty member at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center who studies viral evolution, re-analyzed the gene and protein sequences used by the authors and found that the so-called \u201cunique\u201d inserts appeared in many other organisms, including Cryptosporidium and Plasmodium malariae, which cause cryptosporidiosis and malaria, respectively.\n\nAssistant professor at Stanford University Silvana Konermann also checked the authors\u2019 findings and came to the same conclusion, calling the similarity \u201cspurious\u201d.\n\nIn summary, there is no reason to believe that these inserts are unique to either HIV or 2019-nCoV, or that their presence in 2019-nCoV indicates they were inserted from HIV. This is because the sequences analyzed by the study authors were so short that it is easy to find similarities to a wide variety of organisms. An analogy would be to search for a short word, like \u201ctrain\u201d, in a search engine and claim that the contents in the search results must be identical or similar to each other based on that one word.\n\n \n\n \n\n Aaron T. Irving, Senior Research Fellow, Duke-NUS Medical School:\n\n It\u2019s easier to believe misinformation when it is mixed with truth. The region highlighted in the pre-print is indeed an insertion in nCoV-2019 relative to its bat ancestors and indeed it has high identity to the HIV gp120/gag. However, the authors chose to align only this small region and not do a basic check on whether there were other sequences which were also homologous (showing high degree of similarity/identity). As it turned out, the region is also homologous to many unrelated sequences. As such, the conclusions drawn from the data are no longer valid and there are many open-ended questions regarding this region highlighted. I see the authors themselves agree with this criticism by other scientists and have voluntarily withdrawn their preprint pending a much deeper investigation.\n\nSeveral competing hypotheses have been proposed to explain where the novel coronavirus actually came from. Health Feedback investigated the three most widespread origin stories for the novel coronavirus (engineered, lab-leak or natural infection), and examined the evidence for or against each proposed hypothesis in this Insight article.", "lang": "en"}
