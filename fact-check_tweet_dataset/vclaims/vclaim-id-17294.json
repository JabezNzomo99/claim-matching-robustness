This is the turnover\u2014revenue before costs and tax\u2014generated by Britain\u2019s legal sector in 2015, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. It\u2019s not the take-home pay of lawyers.\n\nThese figures do show a rise of almost a quarter since 2011. But alternative ONS figures show a smaller rise, of less than a fifth over the five-year period. No matter which figures are used, taking inflation into account and looking at growth from year to year rather than over several years would show a much smaller increase.\n\nMore problematic is the contrast made between this picture of robust growth and the protests of lawyers over reductions in government legal aid spending.\n\nGovernment funding for lawyers is falling, even as the legal sector overall expands\n\nAs barrister Barbara Rich puts it, the gist of the Mail\u2019s story is that lawyers have \u201cwrongly complained about financial pressures at a time when lawyers\u2019 incomes were in fact rising\u201d.\n\nBut the legal sector is diverse. It\u2019s perfectly possible for lawyers representing people granted government legal aid to be feeling the pinch, while those doing commercial work on the high street or for big corporate clients are growing their business.\n\nThis is borne out by the figures. Turnover from legal aid work has been falling. Partly because of this and partly because of the rise in overall turnover, the proportion of the sector\u2019s gross revenue accounted for by legal aid was down to 7% in 2014/15. It was 9% in 2006/07, according to the Legal Services Board.\n\nThe Mail\u2019s article notes that \u201cformer Justice Secretary Michael Gove abandoned the attempt to save \u00a3100 million from the \u00a31.6 billion legal aid total at the beginning of this year\u201d. That cut may have been dropped, but others weren\u2019t: before this, the budget for legal aid was over \u00a32 billion throughout the last decade, even before adjusting for inflation.\n\nThe changes that made this reduction possible led to protests by criminal legal aid lawyers in particular. Their counterparts working in the likes of corporate, tax or intellectual property law weren\u2019t directly affected, as their business comes from private clients rather than government legal aid.\n\nLegal sector turnover isn\u2019t the same as salaries, but they\u2019re also up\n\nSolicitors working in legal aid earn around a third less than their counterparts who don\u2019t take publicly-funded work, according to a 2015 survey by the Law Society.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that such lawyers are poor: legal aid solicitors who own a stake in their firm earned an average of \u00a370,000 that year: well over twice the national average. Again, that\u2019s considerably less than equity partners who don\u2019t take legal aid clients. As the Law Society told us, though, partners\u2019 income is more like the profits from their company than a salary.\n\nSalaried solicitors have seen their incomes rise slowly but surely: the \u00a344,000 average pay of an assistant or associate solicitor has risen 12% since 2000, adjusted for inflation. Again, there\u2019s considerable variation within that: the Law Society survey suggests that a quarter of those lawyers earned \u00a335,000 or less, while another quarter\u2014likely to be concentrated in large commercial firms\u2014earned \u00a364,000 or more.\n\nThis distinction between privately-funded legal work and the publicly-funded part of the legal profession is the main reason that lawyers accuse the Mail of not comparing like with like.", "lang": "en"}
