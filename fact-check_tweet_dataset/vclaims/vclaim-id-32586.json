Among those who shared it is the editor-in-chief of Newstrack, Yogesh Mishra, who also used the hashtag #Kashmir.\n\nThe claim is viral on both Facebook and Twitter.\n\nA few users have also shared the video using a caption in English \u2013 \u201cCloud sitting on road at Tibet.\u201d\n\nEntertainment website Latestly had written an article on the video in September 2018, also claiming that it shows \u2018clouds\u2019.\n\nAmerican TV host Ken Rutkowski was among those who shared the video in 2018, tweeting, \u201cThis natural phenomenon is very rare.\u201d\n\nUpon reverse-searching one of the frames on Yandex, Alt News was redirected to a Croatian website according to the which the video shows a desert storm. This article was published on July 4, 2016, and claims that the event took place in China.\n\nWhile Alt News was unable to independently verify the location, a close look at the video makes it evident that the mass is not made of clouds. There\u2019s a distinct difference in the shade of the clouds visible in the sky and the mass on the road, which is wheatish brown in colour.\n\nFurthermore, there are several such videos of sandstorms available on YouTube.\n\nThe phenomenon has also been reported in the media where similar images can be seen.\n\nThe misinformation was debunked by ABP Newsin 2018 when the channel spoke with Mahesh Palawat, meteorologist at Skymet Weather Services. \u201cWhen clouds descend to the ground, the phenomenon is called \u2018Cloud Resting on Ground\u2019 or fog. But this is a sandstorm,\u201d he informed.\n\nThe video viral on social media does not show cloud cover on the road but sandstorm.", "lang": "en"}
