TRUMP 2020,\u201d reads the lower portion of the image.\n\nThis picture is a doctored image of Obama and Khamenei.\n\nRepublicans criticized Obama during his presidency for appearing to bow during introductions with multiple foreign heads of state. In this case, however, Obama not only didn\u2019t bow to Khamenei, the meeting shown actually never took place. The image in question was photoshopped using two unrelated photographs.\n\nThe image of Obama was taken when 5-year-old Jacob Philadelphia visited the Oval Office in 2009. During an interview with TIME, Pete Souza, chief photographer for the White House, explained the picture.\n\n\u201cHis friends had said his haircut was just like the president\u2019s, and he wanted to see if it really was,\u201d said Souza, speaking of the child. \u201cHe asked the president if he could touch his head and the president bent over, and he touched his head.\u201d\n\nThe photograph of Khamenei was taken at the 2005 inaugural ceremony for former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Tehran.\n\nThe meme has been circulating since at least 2013, according to Snopes, and originally featured a watermark for the website \u201cAll the Right Snark.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
