Nagar, Hyderabad. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Photo of the kids missing from L.B. Nagar, Hyderabad. Fact: Kids in the photo are not missing from L.B. Nagar (Hyderabad) but from Coimbatore. The Rachakonda Police has tweeted that no such missing case was reported in L.B. Nagar. The Ramanathapuram Police in Coimbatore has confirmed that the two kids in the photo and their father are missing from Coimbatore, and a missing case was filed at their station. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen looked for some information on the missing children, it was found that the Rachakonda Police has tweeted the same photo and wrote that no such missing case was registered at L.B. Nagar Police Station. They also called it as \u2018Fake news\u2019.\n\nIt was found that Tamil actor Dhanush has also tweeted the same photo without specifying the location of missing. The same photo was also shared as a missing case from Coimbatore.\n\nWhen searched on Google with the keywords \u2018\u0b95\u0bc1\u0bb4\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc8\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bc8\u0b95\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bbe\u0ba3\u0bb5\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0bb2\u0bc8\u2019 (\u2018kids missing\u2019 in Tamil), it was found that a local news website in Coimbatore has written an article on this missing case. In the article, it was found that a missing case regarding the two kids (Shasha Laydisa (9) and Sarah Laydisa (4)) and their father (Ashwin Terry Sam (37)) was filed by the kids\u2019 mother at Ramanathapuram Police Station (Coimbatore). To confirm the news, FACTLY has contacted the Ramanathapuram Police Station. The Ramanathapuram SI has confirmed that a missing case has been filed at their station regarding the two kids in the photo. So, it can be concluded that the two kids in the photo are in no way connected to L.B. Nagar or Hyderabad.\n\nTo sum it up, the two kids in the photo are missing from Coimbatore, not L.B. Nagar (Hyderabad).\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Indian Rivers?", "lang": "en"}
