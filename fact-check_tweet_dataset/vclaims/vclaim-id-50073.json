Poubel and the people accompanying him go through the facility\u2019s gate, appearing angry and yelling at individuals already inside.\n\n\u201cWOW!!!

The field hospital had neither opened nor started accepting patients yet when the footage was taken, according to AFP Fact Check.\n\nThe video comes from a Facebook livestream Poubel shared on May 27, expressing his displeasure at the unfinished field hospital. He also posted the footage on YouTube later that day. In the video, Poubel can be heard addressing viewers, saying at the beginning that he has come to inspect the facility because it failed to open the day it was supposed to, according to the YouTube\u2019s English closed-caption subtitles.\n\nPoubel appeared to confirm that the video had been miscaptioned when he retweeted AFP\u2019s Arabic-language fact check article debunking the claim.
