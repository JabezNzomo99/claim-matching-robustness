The claim is misleading; the video shows Ardern visiting the temple on August 6, 2020, three days before the country hit its 100-day milestone; on August 11, New Zealand recorded four new locally transmitted COVID-19 infections after 102 consecutive days of no community infections.\n\nThe two-minute and 54-second video was published on Facebook here on August 8, 2020.\n\nThe caption reads: \u201cNew Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern visits Hindu Temple after declaring no Covid patients in her country.\u201d\n\nThe video was also shared alongside the same claim here, here, here and here on Facebook, and here, here and here on Twitter.\n\nThe claim, however, is misleading.\n\nKeyword and reverse image searches found that the footage shows Ardern visiting the Hindu temple in the city of Auckland on August 6, 2020.\n\nThree days later, on August 9, New Zealand announced that it had been 100 days since it had recorded a single COVID-19 case that \u201cwas acquired locally from an unknown source,\u201d the Ministry of Health declared here.\n\nThe same footage of Ardern\u2019s August 6 visit was also published on YouTube here on August 7 by Desh Gujarat, a regional Indian news outlet. The post is titled: \u201cNew Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern visits Radha Krishna Hindu Temple in Auckland.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of keyframes in the misleading post (L) and the YouTube video (R):\n\nArdern visited the temple to speak at an event organised by Indian Newslink and Radio Tarana, two Indian community media outlets in New Zealand.\n\nIndian Newslink published the livestream of Ardern\u2019s speech here and a photo album of the event here and here. Radio Tarana published photos from the event here.\n\nThe August 6 event was also attended by Muktesh Pardeshi, India\u2019s High Commissioner to New Zealand. Pardeshi published photos of Ardern\u2019s visit to the temple here on Twitter on August 8.\n\n\u201cSome precious moments with the honourable Prime Minister of New Zealand, Ardern, at \u2066Indian Newslink event on 6 Aug 2020. She paid a short visit to Radha Krishna Mandir and enjoyed a simple Indian vegetarian meal- Puri, Chhole and Daal,\u201d the tweet read.\n\nNew Zealand's dream run of 102 days without locally transmitted coronavirus ended on August 11, prompting a stay-at-home lockdown order for the country's largest city, Auckland, AFP reported here.\n\nThe misleading post was also debunked by BOOM, an Indian fact-checking organisation, here on August 11, 2020,", "lang": "en"}
