Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: COVID-19 sensor inserted into everyone illegally by Apple and Google which can track people. Fact: While it is true that Apple and Google have jointly developed and rolled out the \u2018Exposure Notifications System\u2019 which uses Bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies reduce the spread of COVID-19 through contact tracing, it does not track everyone freely. The system remains \u2018off\u2019 unless the user opts for it and one can opt-out of it anytime. It is one\u2019s choice whether to accept it or not, so there is no illegal coercion. Also, it does not collect or use location data. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\n\nOn looking in the \u2018Settings>Google\u2019 section on any Android phone (Also, on iPhone), one can find the option \u2013 \u2018COVID-19 exposure notifications\u2019. In it, it can be read that a participating app is required to turn on COVID-19 exposure notifications and that it uses Bluetooth technology. When searched for information on that option, it was found that Apple and Google have jointly developed and rolled out the \u2018Exposure Notifications System\u2019 which uses Bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies reduce the spread of COVID-19 through contact tracing. The related documents can be found on Google and Apple websites.\n\nIn the below gif (taken from Google website), one can see how the technology works.\n\nIt can be seen in the documents on the Google and Apple websites that the system does not track everyone freely. The system remains \u2018off\u2019 unless the user opts for it and one can opt-out of it anytime. It is one\u2019s choice whether to accept it or not, so there is no illegal coercion. Also, it does not collect or use location data.\n\nIt can also be read that, in the first phase, \u2018both companies will release application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow contact tracing apps from public health authorities to work across Android and iOS devices, while maintaining user privacy.\u2019 And, in the second phase, \u2018this capability will be introduced at the operating system level to help ensure broad adoption, which is vital to the success of contact tracing. After the operating system update is installed and the user has opted in, the system will send out and listen for the Bluetooth beacons as in the first phase, but without requiring an app to be installed\u2019. More detailed information can be found here and here.\n\nTo sum it up, Apple and Google\u2019s \u2018Exposure Notifications System\u2019 works on your phone only if you opt for it.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
