The clip is misleading; it claims to show a family devastated by infection, as well as the doctor who invented the mask it is trying to sell, but the images are stock footage.\n\n\"Do It Now or Never!\u201d says text under the video, which was posted on April 5, 2020 and urges people to buy \u201cFilterMax\u201d face masks. Following the publication of this fact check, the clip was removed for violating Facebook's community standards.\n\nThe video -- which refers to \u201cthe fatal pandemic\u201d and the shortage of masks it has caused, does not name the novel coronavirus -- but tells the alleged story of Justin, the \u201cyoungest son from a family of five\u201d who it claims is the \u201csole survivor from a deadly tragedy.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe video says Justin\u2019s family ignored warnings to stay indoors -- issued by governments and health authorities during the ongoing novel coronavirus crisis -- and went to a church event, where they were infected and died. Justin, it says, wore one of the masks and lived.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m devastated right now but at the same time I couldn't stop thinking I narrowly escaped death, thanks to FilterMax,\u201d says text in the video that appears with an image of a boy identified as Justin.\n\nAFP conducted reverse image searches of screenshots from the clip, which revealed that the videos and photos of key people shown in the clip were taken from stock image websites.\n\nThe family seen at the beginning of the video can be found here and here.\n\nThe footage of the boy in the clip comes from this stock video.\n\n\u201cDr Hiroshi,\u201d described in the video as the \u201cInfectious Disease specialist\u201d who created the mask, is actually two different models from stock image sites here and here.\n\nThe same story has been used before to advertise \u201cFilterMax\u201d face masks on Facebook, but with different images.\n\nAnother version of the misleading ad, now removed from Facebook, used a photo of a family taken during a professional photoshoot. After seeing the video pop up in her feed, one family member reported it to the platform, according to a local TV report.\n\n\n\nFootage of the boy in that version of the clip came from a video about a teenager with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, while it used footage of Nobel laureate Yoshinori Ohsumi to represent the inventor of the mask.\n\nThe misleading ads, which play heavily on fears with dramatic music in the background, have been viewed more than 1.1 million times on Facebook.\n\nAlthough advertising the same product, the videos linked to different sites where they could be bought -- here and here -- both of which are now unavailable.\n\nAnd while the videos claim the boy\u2019s life was saved because he wore a mask, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends the use of face coverings to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus to others, not to keep the wearer from becoming infected.", "lang": "en"}
