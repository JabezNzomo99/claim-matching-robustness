The exemption limit is therefore still Rs 2.50 lakhs, ie, you are exempted from paying tax on taxable income (income minus relevant deductions) of upto Rs 2.50 lakhs per year.\n\nIf your income is above Rs 2.50 lakhs, you are liable to tax, depending on how much your income is. The amount of tax you pay can, however, be reduced if you are eligible for any tax rebates.\n\nA rebate is therefore a reduction in the amount of tax you are required to pay. It is different from a refund, which you get after first paying the tax. It is also different from an exemption, which reduces your taxable income.", "lang": "en"}
