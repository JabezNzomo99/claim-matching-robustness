Let\u2019s check the veracity of the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Images of BJP men smearing cow dung on one another after their party leader Suman Haripriya has said that cow dung may help cure Coronavirus. Fact: Assam BJP MLA Suman Haripriya has made those statements on 02 March 2020. But the images are from \u2018Goraihabba\u2019 festival that was celebrated in Thalavadi (Tamil Nadu) on 30 October 2019. In the festival, people smear cow dung on one another as part of their celebration. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nAs per 2 March 2020 article of \u2018New18\u2019, Assam BJP MLA Suman Haripriya claimed that cow dung may help cure Coronavirus.\n\nWhen the images were subjected to reverse image search technique, a video of \u2018News flare\u2019 website was obtained in the search results. In that video, visuals related to both the images were seen. The video had the description that it is related to \u2018Goraihabba\u2019 festival that was celebrated in Thalavadi (Tamil Nadu) on 30 October 2019. In \u2018Goraihabba\u2019 festival, people smear cow dung on one another as part of their celebration. More about the festival can be found here and here.\n\nTo conclude, old images of people smearing cow dung during a festival are being shared in the wake of BJP leader\u2019s statements about cow dung being a cure for Coronavirus. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
