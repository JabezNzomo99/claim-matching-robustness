By 2030, another 11 years away, it might be $5 trillion.\u201d\n\nAAP FactCheck examined the claims by Greg Combet, a former Labor government minister and now Industry Super Australia chairman, that Australia\u2019s superannuation pool was bigger and growing faster than the ASX market and GDP and could reach $5 trillion by 2030. [1]\n\nSuperannuation is a major factor in the retirement plans of millions of Australians who will rely on it to supplement any government pension and fund their lifestyle to the grave. Any changes to super are contentious and both sides of politics have been criticised for making changes to super laws.\n\nAustralia\u2019s modern superannuation system, in which employers make compulsory contributions of 9.5 per cent to employees, started in 1992. The rate is due to rise to 10 per cent on July 1, 2021.\n\nAhead of the March 18 election the coalition government is \u201cguaranteeing no new taxes on superannuation\u201d and \u201cimproving flexibility of the superannuation system\u201d. [2]\n\nLabor has been criticised for its plan to close a concession, introduced by the Howard government, that gives \u201ccash refunds for excess dividend imputation credits\u201d , a move it says will make Australia's tax system fairer. Labor says this tax loophole costs $8 billion a year and \u201cmainly benefits millionaires who don\u2019t pay income tax\u201d. [3]\n\nAccording to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, total superannuation assets as of December 31, 2018 totalled $2.65 trillion [4]\n\nAccording to Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) data, its market capitalisation in March, 2019 stood at $1.95 trillion. [5]\n\nAustralian Bureau of Statistics data shows GDP in 2017-18 stood at $1.81 trillion. [6]\n\nBased on these figures, AAP FactCheck found that Mr Combet\u2019s claim that Australia\u2019s superannuation pool was larger than the ASX market capitalisation and Australia's GDP by a \u201cdecent margin\u201d to be true.\n\nRegarding Mr Combet\u2019s second claim that super will grow more rapidly than the ASX and GDP, global auditing and financial firm Deloitte predicts Australia's superannuation pool will grow by at least 200 per cent between 2015 ($2 trillion) and 2030 (above $6 trillion). [7]\n\nDeloitte said its research was \"based on a combination of data collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia (ASFA) and other public organisations and associations, together with research conducted by Deloitte\". [7]\n\nAccording to ASX data, market capitalisation has grown 33.83 per cent in the six years from April 2013 ($1.457 trillion) to April 2019 ($1.95 trillion). [5]\n\nAccording to Reserve Bank data, Australia's GDP has grown between two and three per cent per year since 2013 and is projected to stay in that range until 2022. [8]\n\nBased on these figures, AAP FactCheck found Mr Combet\u2019s claim the superannuation assets will grow more rapidly than the ASX and GDP is true.\n\nRegarding the third claim that the super pool could reach $5 trillion by 2030, Deloitte projects it will be closer to $6 trillion.\n\nBased on this projection, AAP FactCheck found that Mr Combet\u2019s third claim to be true.\n\nAAP FactCheck concludes that the three claims made by Mr Combet regarding Australia\u2019s superannuation total are all true.", "lang": "en"}
