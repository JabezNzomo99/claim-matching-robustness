The tweet claims that the image shows \u2018Hindu\u2019 Danish Kaneria & \u2018Christian\u2019 Yousuf Youhana offering Namaz during a match of Pakistan cricket team under the captaincy of Inzamam-ul-Haq. Let\u2019s analyze the authenticity of the claim. \n\n\n\nThe tweet (archived) in the screenshot was put by BJP Mahila Morcha\u2019s National In-charge of social media \u2013 \u2018Priti Gandhi\u2019. In the comments section of the tweet, \u2018Umar Farooq Kalson\u2019, whose Twitter profile describes himself as Pakistan correspondent to \u2018ESPNcricinfo\u2019, has written that the man in the extreme left is not Danish Kaneria. He said that the person is Abdul Rauf, Pak cricket team\u2019s physiotherapist in 2006, and also, Yousaf at the time of that photo was \u2018Mohammad\u2019 Yousuf.\n\nWhen the image in the screenshot is cropped and subjected to reverse image search, it was found in the \u2018Getty Images\u2019. The image was found to have been clicked in August 2006 at Bristol (England) during Natwest T20 Series.\n\nWith the above information, when searched on Google, the full scorecard of that match was found. The scorecard clarifies that Danish Kaneria wasn\u2019t part of the team played during that match.\n\nAnd, from the 2005 article of \u2018ESPNcricinfo\u2019, it was found that Yousuf Youhana has converted to Islam and from thenceforth would be known as \u2018Mohammed Yousuf\u2019. So, the image was clicked after Yousuf has converted to Islam.\n\nTo sum it up, the image in the post doesn\u2019t have Danish Kaneria in it and also, it was clicked after Yousuf had converted to Islam.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
