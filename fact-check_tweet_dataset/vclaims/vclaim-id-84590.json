In this video, he claims that the car in which he was traveling was attacked near then Chief Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s residence. The original video has been deleted hence we have re-uploaded the video.\n\nThe rough transcript of the video is as follows:\n\nAnd we came out 50m from his residence and we were stopped. Suddenly our Ambassador car is stopped and there are people who are breaking the windows with trishuls. They are breaking the windows..all the windows are broken. It\u2019s almost as if there are trishuls all around and I know this is very unsavory but I must share with you the reality of life as I have seen it. When that happens we are all going to reveal our religion. It is 50m from the Chief Minister\u2019s house. How it happened, I don\u2019t know. We said we are journalists .. (No, No.. what is your religion, what is your religion) And thankfully there was nobody from minority community with us\u2026We had our identity cards, press cards, my driver didn\u2019t have a press card, I looked at him, and I was sitting in the front, I have an obsession with sitting in the front seat and I looked to my right and I can see the look on my driver\u2019s face. When people talk of secularism, I have seen hate from up close and I know that group of people would have killed him. He had a Tattoo, he put a \u2018hey ram\u2019 or something on his .. it is not a tattoo, it is just actually an imprint that you put which stays with you. He showed that and we walked out. But I saw for that moment how scared you..\n\nHowever, soon after the video reappeared on social media, Rajdeep Sardesai in a series of tweets claimed that Arnab was misrepresenting facts. It was actually Rajdeep himself who was in the car and he had written about this in his book \u201c2014: The Election That Changed India\u201d.\n\nHe also retweeted a couple of journalists who were in Ahmedabad with Rajdeep during this period with Sanjeev Singh being the NDTV Correspondent based out of Ahmedabad during this time period.\n\nAlt News spoke to Sanjeev Singh and he told us that Rajdeep had gone to CM Modi\u2019s place to get his views on the Godhra train burning incident and the ensuing riots on Feb 28th. Later they realised that the clip did not have any audio which meant that the interview had to be re-recorded. At this point, Rajdeep and the crew had to go back to CM Modi\u2019s place. There were 5 people in the car including Rajdeep. When they left from CM\u2019s residence after recording the interview, their car was gheraoed by a mob. Sanjeev Singh also told Alt news that Arnab Goswami came later and he was deputed to Kheda district in Gujarat.\n\nAlt News further spoke to one of the camera technicians who was in the crew that visited CM Modi\u2019s place on that day. He confirmed that the sequence of events that were narrated by Arnab Goswami actually happened but Arnab was not present in the car.\n\nAs a face saving measure, a Republic TV employee Prema Sridevi has put out a picture in which Arnab Goswami and Rajdeep Sardesai are seen in the same frame with the text, \u201cThe crew that covered 2002 Gujarat riots\u201d.\n\nHowever, Maya Mirchandani of NDTV confirmed that the picture was taken at a later date.\n\nIt is shameful enough that Arnab Goswami passed off an incident that happened with someone else in a first person narrative but the backhanded attempts of putting out misleading pictures via a Republic Employee puts a further question mark on Arnab Goswami\u2019s journalistic ethics.", "lang": "en"}
