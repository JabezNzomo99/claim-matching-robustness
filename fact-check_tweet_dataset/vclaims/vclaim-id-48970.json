You should not click this link.\n\nThere are a number of clues on the page which bring into question the page\u2019s legitimacy.\n\nThe website appears to be hosted via a Polish domain, despite claiming to report UK local news.\n\nThe story claims that the child went missing on 12 May in one paragraph, but on 15 January in the next. As we\u2019ve also seen before the article headline appears to have been adapted to say the little girl went missing in various locations, for example, Watford, Milton Keynes and Aylesbury, all using the same photo.\n\nIt includes a quote from a police \u201cCaptain\u201d, a rank that does not exist in UK police forces.\n\nThe apparent Facebook comments under the article are not real, and clicking on them does not lead to any Facebook profiles.\n\nThere have been no reports from Missing People, Child Rescue Alert, or news stories about a child called Alice going missing in the UK this year.\n\nThis all suggests the story about the missing girl is not real.\n\nYou should never give your Facebook password to a website other than Facebook.
