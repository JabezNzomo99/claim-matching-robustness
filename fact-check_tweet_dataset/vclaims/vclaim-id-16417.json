It is geographically small, about one-quarter the size of Rhode Island. Ashok Kumar Mirpuri, the country\u2019s ambassador to the United States, says Singapore\u2019s tough drug laws are an effective deterrent to trafficking. \u201cSingapore has one of the lowest rates of drug abuse in the world: 30 opiates abusers per 100,000 people, compared with 600 in the United States,\u201d he wrote in a letter to the editor to The Washington Post in March.\n\nIndonesia: The president of Indonesia has called on police to shoot drug dealers who resist arrest. \u201cShoot them because we indeed are in a narcotics emergency position now,\u201d he was quoted as saying by Reuters in 2017. However, HRI did not learn of instances of drug dealers being executed in 2017, and it reported that \u201cin January 2018, Indonesian politicians agreed to soften the country\u2019s harsh death penalty laws by imposing a 10-year stay on executions, after which death sentences could be commuted to a prison term.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cIt is also worrying that President Trump states that the death penalty would have a deterrent effect on drug crime, when there is no evidence suggesting that this is the case, for drug or any crime. We have seen already in other countries that the death penalty has failed to stop the illegal drug trade or protect those who use drugs and those around them.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
