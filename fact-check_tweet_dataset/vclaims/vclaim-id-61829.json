He criticized fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton's candidacy, arguing that he represents a more dramatic contrast to John McCain, the apparent Republican front-runner.\n\nIn making his argument, Obama attacked Clinton for voting with Republicans on national security issues.\n\nAmong Obama's points: \"It's time for new leadership that understands that the way to win a debate with John McCain is not by nominating someone who agreed with him on voting for the war in Iraq.\"\n\nObama is referring to the 2002 vote authorizing the use of force in Iraq, widely considered to have given President Bush the authority for the invasion. Clinton voted for the measure, as did McCain. Obama was not in the U.S. Senate at that time, though he did give a speech opposing the war while an Illinois state senator.\n\nObama is right: Clinton and McCain were on the same side in voting for the use of force in Iraq.
