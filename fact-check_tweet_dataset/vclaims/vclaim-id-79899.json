A spokesperson for the union denied it created the image.\n\nIn recent weeks, the U.S. has seen a significant delay in mail delivery from the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), according to The Washington Post. President Donald Trump has been accused of meddling with the postal service in order to stifle mail-in voting efforts in the upcoming presidential election, NBC News reported.\n\nAn image seemingly shows a graphic from the \u201cpostal workers union\u201d that appears to assure people mail will be delivered in various circumstances. The graphic depicts the words \u201csnow,\u201d \u201crain,\u201d \u201cheat,\u201d \u201cnight\u201d and \u201cfascism\u201d with red lines through them, followed by the phrase \u201cnothing stops the mail.\u201d The logo of the USPS and a link to the APWU website also appears at the bottom.\n\nHowever, the APWU, one of several postal workers unions that contract with the USPS, did not create or share the graphic. The Daily Caller News Foundation searched the union\u2019s website, as well as its verified Twitter account, but found nothing resembling the image.\n\n\u201cThis did not come from us,\u201d confirmed Jamie Horwitz, a spokesperson for the union, in an email to the DCNF. \u201cOur lawyers would have killed us if we ever used the USPS logo in this manner.\u201d (RELATED: Did The Postal Service Unveil A Donald Trump Postage Stamp?)\n\nThe USPS also confirmed they had no hand in creating the graphic. \u201cThe below did not come from the Postal Service and is not an authorized use of our logo,\u201d said Dave Partenheimer, a USPS spokesperson, in an email to the DCNF.\n\nThe graphic appears to have been created by Twitter user @RobinCantDance, who shared the image in an Aug. 10 tweet, saying, \u201cI made a meme. Share it.\u201d It has circulated widely on Twitter and Facebook in recent days.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
