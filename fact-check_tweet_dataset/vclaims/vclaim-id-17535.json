Mueller\u2019s team may have had with his March 24 memo summarizing the Mueller report. We\u2019ll lay out the facts about Mueller\u2019s letter to Barr, Barr\u2019s April testimony to Congress, and what the attorney general said about it in his May 1 testimony.\n\nOn March 24, Barr issued a four-page memo about the Mueller report, which wouldn\u2019t be released, in redacted form, until April 18. We now know that Mueller had concerns about Barr\u2019s memo, which he expressed in a March 27 letter. That letter says the special counsel\u2019s office also had \u201ccommunicated\u201d concerns on March 25.\n\nThe Washington Post and New York Times reported on the existence of the March 27 letter on April 30, and the Justice Department released it the following day, before Barr was set to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nIn his letter, Mueller told Barr that the attorney general\u2019s March 24 summary \u201cdid not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office\u2019s work and conclusions,\u201d a point Mueller said his office made to the Department of Justice on March 25. Mueller asked that Barr publicly release redacted introductions and executive summaries from the special counsel report, which Mueller included with his letter, saying, \u201cRelease at this time would alleviate the misunderstandings that have arisen and would answer congressional and public questions about the nature and outcome of our investigation.\u201d\n\nMueller, letter to Barr, March 27: As we stated in our meeting of March 5 and reiterated to the Department early in the afternoon of March 24, the introductions and executive summaries of our two-volume report accurately summarize this Office\u2019s work and conclusions. The summary letter the Department sent to Congress and released to the public late in the afternoon of March 24 did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office\u2019s work and conclusions. We communicated that concern to the Department on the morning of March 25. There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations.\n\nOnce that letter came to light, Democrats said Barr had misled Congress and should resign. In the May 1 hearing, Sen. Mazie Hirono said Barr had \u201clied.\u201d Democrats pointed to two exchanges on April 9 and 10 between Barr and Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist and Sen. Chris Van Hollen.\n\nPrior to those hearings, on April 3, the Times, and the following day the Post, reported that members of Mueller\u2019s team were concerned that Barr\u2019s memo didn\u2019t adequately reflect their findings, in particular that the evidence on possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump was more damaging than Barr\u2019s memo indicated.\n\nOn April 9, when Barr testified before a House appropriations subcommittee, Crist asked him about those media reports.\n\nCrist, April 9: Reports have emerged recently \u2026 that members of the special counsel\u2019s team are frustrated at some level with the limited information included in your March 24th letter, that it does not adequately or accurately, necessarily, portray the report\u2019s findings. Do you know what they\u2019re referencing with that? Barr: No, I don\u2019t. I think, I think, I suspect that they probably wanted, you know, more put out. But in my view, I was not interested in putting out summaries or trying to summarize, because I think any summary regardless of who prepares it not only runs the risk of, you know, being under-inclusive or over-inclusive but also, you know, would trigger a lot of discussion and analysis that really should await everything coming out at once.\n\nOn April 10, Barr was before a Senate appropriations subcommittee when Van Hollen asked him about his conclusion in the March 24 memo that \u201cthe evidence developed during the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t know what Mueller thought of Barr\u2019s conclusion on whether the president had committed obstruction of justice. Mueller doesn\u2019t say anything about that in his March 27 letter to Barr. Instead, the special counsel took issue with what Barr\u2019s memo said about the conclusions of Mueller\u2019s investigation. Mueller wrote that Barr\u2019s memo \u201cdid not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office\u2019s work and conclusions.\u201d\n\nWith the Crist exchange, however, we know that Barr was aware of Mueller\u2019s concerns about the March 24 memo. In May 1 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Barr drew a distinction between being asked about the concerns of \u201cmembers of the special counsel\u2019s team,\u201d which was Crist\u2019s question, as opposed to being asked about Mueller himself. Barr also claimed that Crist\u2019s question was \u201ca very different question\u201d than one \u201crelated\u201d to the Mueller letter.\n\nBarr said in his opening statement \u2014 and this was part of the Washington Post report the day before \u2014 that he called Mueller after receiving the March 27 letter.\n\nBarr, May 1: I asked [Mueller] if he was suggesting that the March 24th letter was inaccurate, and he said no, but that the press reporting had been inaccurate and that the press was reading too much into it. \u2026 He said that his concern focused on his explanation of why he did not reach a conclusion on obstruction, and he wanted more put out on that issue. He wanted, he argued for putting out summaries of each volume, the executive summaries that had been written by his office, and if not that then other material that focused on the issue of why he didn\u2019t reach the obstruction question. But he was very clear with me that he was not suggesting that we had misrepresented his report.\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy, a Democrat, asked Barr why he didn\u2019t reveal that Mueller had concerns when he was questioned by Crist in April.\n\nLeahy, May 1: Why did you testify on April 9 that you didn\u2019t know the concerns being expressed by Mueller\u2019s team, when in fact you had heard those concerns directly from Mr. Mueller two weeks before? Barr: Well, as I said, I talked directly to Bob Mueller about his letter to me and specifically asked him, what exactly are your concerns, are you saying that the March 24th letter was misleading or inaccurate or what. He indicated that it was not. \u2026 The question from Crist was, reports have emerged recently, press reports that members of the special counsel\u2019s team are frustrated at some level with the limited information included in your March 24th letter in that they don\u2019t adequately or accurately portray the report\u2019s findings [Barr emphasized the word \u201cfindings\u201d]. I don\u2019t know what members he\u2019s talking about, and I certainly am not aware of any challenge to the accuracy of the findings. Leahy: \u2026 My question was why would you say you were not aware of concerns when weeks before your testimony Mr. Mueller had expressed concerns to you? \u2026 Barr: Well, I answered a question. And the question was relating to unidentified members who were expressing frustration over the accuracy relating to findings. I don\u2019t know what that refers to at all. I talked directly to Bob Mueller, not members of his team. And even though I did not know what was being referred to, and Mueller had never told me that the expression of the findings was inaccurate, but I did then volunteer that I thought they were talking about the desire to have more information put out. But it wasn\u2019t my purpose to put out more information. Leahy: Mr. Barr, I feel your answer was purposefully misleading, and I think others do, too.\n\nMueller\u2019s letter said Barr\u2019s March 24 memo \u201cdid not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office\u2019s work and conclusions,\u201d while Crist asked about media reports that members of Mueller\u2019s team \u201care frustrated at some level with the limited information included in your March 24th letter, that it does not adequately or accurately, necessarily, portray the report\u2019s findings.\u201d Barr focused on the word \u201caccurately,\u201d saying that Mueller never told him \u201cthe expression of the findings was inaccurate.\u201d But Mueller did say the Barr memo didn\u2019t \u201cfully capture\u201d Mueller\u2019s conclusions, and he asked Barr to release more information.\n\nLater in the May 1 hearing, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse accused Barr of \u201cmasterful hairsplitting\u201d when Barr denied that Crist\u2019s question was \u201cvery related\u201d to the Mueller letter.\n\nWe\u2019ll leave it to readers to decide whether Crist\u2019s question was \u201cvery related\u201d or \u201cvery different.\u201d But at the very least, the attorney general didn\u2019t give Congress the full story about what he knew regarding the special counsel\u2019s concerns about his March 24 memo.", "lang": "en"}
