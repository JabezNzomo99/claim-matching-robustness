Why isn\u2019t the media showing this???\u201d\n\nThis is a photoshopped image of a 1985 Live Aid benefit concert in London.\n\nThis image attempts to depict large turnout for a supposed rally held by Trump, who officially kicked off his 2020 presidential election campaign Tuesday. Posted on May 27, the meme suggests the rally had occurred the day before.\n\nThe president did hold a rally in Pennsylvania that month, but it took place on May 20 in Montoursville, coming two days after Democratic candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden made his own stop in Philadelphia. Trump\u2019s visit was meant to bolster support for Republican congressional candidate Fred Keller ahead of a special election. However, this image does not show that rally.\n\nThe actual picture, found on a Queen fan page, captures the band\u2019s performance at a 1985 Live Aid benefit concert, according to the photo caption. The event raised relief money for a then-ongoing Ethiopian famine, with more than 72,000 people in attendance at Wembley Stadium on July 13, 1985. The photoshopped image covers up the Live Aid branding on either side of the stage with \u201cTrump 2020\u201d logos and hides the tent featured in the original image with a Trump banner.\n\nFurthermore, signage above the stage in the photoshopped image gives away the true nature of the photo. \u201cFeed the World. July 13th 1985 at Wembley Stadium,\u201d it reads.\n\nThe image also closely resembles a picture taken by photographer Brendan Monks at the event.", "lang": "en"}
