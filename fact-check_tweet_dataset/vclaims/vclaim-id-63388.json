The message has a link which states that the users can \u2018instantly claim\u2019 the amount using the given link. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim.\n\nLet\u2019s check for clues and try to ascertain the authenticity of the message:\n\n1. When the link (https://bit.ly/free\u2014funds) in the post is opened, it is directed to a website (http://fund.ramaphosafoundations.com/). The website address (domain) of this website is different from the website domain of government sites which generally end with \u2018gov.in\u2019 or \u2018nic.in\u2019.\n\n2. Regardless of the number of times a person visits the website, the page will show \u2013 \u2018Left 1936 FREE lockdown packages\u2019.\n\n3. Clicking on any of the options on the page, it displays packages offering \u2018\u20b9 2,000, \u20b9 5,000 and \u20b9 10,000 (not unavailable)\u2019. Regardless of whatever option is chosen, it is directed to a page asking what will the free Rs 5,000 will be used for.\n\n4. After finishing the survey, comments are displayed. In them, the users have mentioned that they received benefits offered by the website. However, irrespective of the number of times the website is visited, the names of the \u2018beneficiaries\u2019 and \u2018timestamp\u2019 always remains the same. Also, the number of \u2018likes\u2019 and \u2018comments\u2019 do not change.\n\n5. At the end of the survey, the website asks users to share the website on WhatsApp groups to get the benefits. It is unlikely for a government website to include such steps for its schemes.\n\nAlso, during the search process, it is found that the same message is also viral in Nigeria and Kenya. Those posts can be seen here and here. The website is in the name of \u2018ramaphosafoundations\u2019. So, when searched if they have started any such scheme, it was found that \u2018Cyril Ramaphosa Foundation\u2019 has already clarified that the message is a scam.\n\nTo conclude, a dubious website promises of providing Rs 5,000 relief fund to each citizen.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
