PM Narendra Modi had said that a soldier dies on the battlefield because he receives a salary for it. The claim is False. A Google Reverse Image search led to a video on Youtube, which is the longer version of the viral clip. Uploaded on March 14, 2017, the video is titled, 'Modi speech related to tiranga yatra'. In the six-minute video, Modi starts the monologues with the same statement as in the viral clip.\n\nThe subsequent statements paint a clearer picture as to what the PM meant to say. \"... a soldier in the army goes to the battlefield to die. Why, because he is paid? He doesn't go to die in the battlefield because he is paid for it...he is ready to die because he loves his motherland,\" Modi can be heard \n\n Further, a prior clip of the same video, that was uploaded in 2012 can be found on Youtube. The viral video is the later part of the longer six-minute video mentioned earlier.\n\nSince the video is on the internet since 2012, it is clear that the PM statement was deliberately edited out and posted on social media\n\n On June 19, at an all-party meeting, PM Modi had said: \"Neither is anyone inside our territory nor are any of our posts captured\", responding to which the Congress questioned whether the PM meant Indian Territory had been ceded to China.
