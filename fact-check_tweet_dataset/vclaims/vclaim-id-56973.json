Vande Mataram)\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above claim and found it to be FAKE.\n\nWhen we extracted the keyframes of the video through InVid and put them through Reverse Image Search, we found a report by a UK tabloid, The Sun, dated August 7, 2019, featuring the same video. The headline of the article read, \u2018SUPERMARKET SWEEP Bizarre moment two women are \u2018caught using Muslim dress to try to steal baby formula in Asda\u2019. According to the report, the police was investigating the footage of two women who were \u2018disguised as Muslim women\u2019 and were allegedly trying to steal items on August 4, 2019, from an Asda store in East London, by hiding them inside their robes. The incident is also covered by another UK daily, Evening Standard. Read the report here. Hence, the above information proves that the video being circulated is old and not from India.
