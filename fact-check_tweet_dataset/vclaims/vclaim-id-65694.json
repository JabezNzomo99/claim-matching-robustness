Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, \u201cIf food runs scarce, it\u2019s okay to eat pets.\u201d\n\nThere is no record of Ocasio-Cortez making the remark. The quote came from a satirical article.\n\nThe image being shared shows the headline of an article published on the website Republicannew.blogspot.com, which no longer appears to be accessible. The headline reads, \u201cOcasio-Cortez: \u2018If Food Runs Scarce, It\u2019s Okay To Eat Pets.'\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no record of Ocasio-Cortez making the statement attributed to her in the headline. It appears on neither her social media pages nor her congressional website. The Daily Caller also didn\u2019t find any credible media reports quoting her as saying the comment, only fact-checkers debunking the attribution.

In May, the Daily Caller debunked the claim that the congresswoman said Jesus \u201cwas a lot like Trump, both con artists,\u201d a quote that came from the satire website Bustatroll.org.", "lang": "en"}
