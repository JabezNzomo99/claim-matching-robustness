On Facebook, thousands have shared a lengthy political statement attributed to him on \"January 24 at 5:41 AM.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m a liberal, but that doesn\u2019t mean what a lot of you apparently think it does,\" the post begins. \"Let\u2019s break it down, shall we? Because quite frankly, I\u2019m getting a little tired of being told what I believe and what I stand for.\"\n\nIt goes on to address 16 points about social services, health care, education and more.\n\n\"I don\u2019t throw around \u2018I\u2019m willing to pay higher taxes\u2019 lightly,\" the author says at one point. At another: \"All I ask is that Christians recognize *my* right to live according to *my* beliefs.\"\n\nThe missive concludes like this: \"Bottom line is that I\u2019m a liberal because I think we should take care of each other. That doesn\u2019t mean you should work 80 hours a week so your lazy neighbor can get all your money. It just means I don\u2019t believe there is any scenario in which preventable suffering is an acceptable outcome as long as money is saved. Copy & paste if you want.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nActress Debra Messing was among an unknown number of people who indeed copied and pasted the message. \"THANK YOU, RON HOWARD,\" she wrote.\n\nBut we checked Howard\u2019s verified Facebook account and there\u2019s no post from Jan. 24, 2020. Or Jan. 24, 2018. On Jan. 24, 2019, he posted a Hollywood Reporter story about a documentary he was tapped to direct. On Jan. 24, 2017, he posted about a book he was adapting for film. Nothing in 2016.\n\nOn Jan. 7, 2018, however, a writer named Lori Gallagher Witt published an open letter that is virtually the same as the one attributed to Ron Howard. At the bottom, it says \"(c) 2018 Lori Gallagher Witt. Feel free to share, but please give me credit, and if you add or change anything, please not accordingly.\"\n\nMore than a year later, she posted about someone poaching her words and publishing them without credit. \"Talk about some brass balls,\" she said.\n\nHer Facebook bio as of May 26? \"Ron Howard didn\u2019t write it. I did.\"", "lang": "en"}
