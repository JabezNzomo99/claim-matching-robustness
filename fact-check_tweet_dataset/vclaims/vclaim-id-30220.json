The fires are so powerful they are creating their own weather and are expected to continue burning for months to come.\n\nBut some, including Alex Jones\u2019 conspiracy site InfoWars that spreads climate change denialism, falsely reported that \u201cnearly 200 people\u201d were arrested in Australia for \u201cdeliberately\u201d starting bushfires.\n\nThat would be a distortion of the facts. Police in New South Wales released a statement disclosing that since Nov. 8, 2019, 183 people, including 40 juveniles, have been charged with 205 bushfire-related offenses. Of the 183, 24 people have been charged with deliberately setting fires. According to police, of the 183, another \u201c53 people have had legal actions for allegedly failing to comply with a total fire ban,\u201d and an additional \u201c47 people have had legal actions for allegedly discarding a lighted cigarette or match on land.\u201d\n\nLocal press reports indicate that not all of the people charged committed acts that contributed to the raging brushfires. For example, a man in the Sydney suburb of Wallacia was fined for lighting a fire to make a cup of tea. That blaze was extinguished by firefighters. Another man was cited for lighting a fire to cook food in the town of Tarro. That fire was also put out by responding crews.\n\nJason Wilson, a columnist and journalist for The Guardian, wrote, \u201cSadly, arsonists exist among us, and are always a factor in bushfires. The number of arrests is being highlighted across right wing media in order to muddy the waters and avoid discussing the real reason that bushfire season is longer and more dangerous.\u201d Wilson pointed to a statement by a fire captain fighting the fires, who said crews are seeing fires the likes they\u2019ve never seen before, and the evidence that climate change is driving them is \u201coverwhelming.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
