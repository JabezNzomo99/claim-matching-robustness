This incident happened in Titas subdivision of Coomilla district in Bangladesh. The issue was also covered by the local news website called Coomilla-r-Kagoj which translates to \u201cCoomilla\u2019s Newspaper\u201d.\n\nThe video of the incident was uploaded by a Bangladeshi resident to Youtube on April 2nd.\n\nThis video is now being circulated by the right-wingers as a Hindu being killed in West Bengal by Muslims. At the time of writing, a cock and bull post by one Ghanshyam Jangid has been already shared over 37000 times on Facebook. This same video is also viral as a Hindu killed in Nawada, Bihar, and we wrote about this yesterday.\n\nHail the unjust media: If a Muslim is killed in Rajasthan, it is \u201cHindu terrorism\u201d, if a Hindu is killed in West Bengal, it is not even covered?\n\n No media channel will show this video.. neither will the Congress party in opposition come on the roads to protest this.\n\n For the murder of those men who were carrying 40 cows for the purpose of slaughtering, Congress and other opposition MPs went to the town chest beating..Based on this incident, they declared that the National integrity is in danger..\n\n In this country where cow slaughter is declared illegal, and even then cows are being cut, then if Hindus get enraged and kill the people who are slaughtering cows then should the Hindus be blamed for this or should those people be blamed who are being unconstitutional and are hurting Hindu sentiments? What is the need to incite our religious feelings? Continue your silence and keep acting like a Hijra (transgender)..\n\nThis post is referring to the mob lynching of 55-year-old Pehlu Khan in Alwar by Gau Rakshaks. The post lies blatantly about 40 cows being transported for the sake of slaughter. As reported by Huffington Post, Pehlu Khan was a dairy farmer who had made a last minute decision of buying a milch cow instead of a milch buffalo at a cattle fair because the cow produced more milk and they had a valid receipt for the purchase of the cow. Other dairy farmers in Pehlu Khan\u2019s village Jaisinghpur confirmed that he indeed used to sell milk for a living.\n\nWhat is happening here is that to cover up the ghastly murder of Pehlu Khan in Alwar, the right-wingers are not only propagating complete falsehoods regarding the incident itself, they also want to justify the murder of Pehlu Khan by showing a fake video of a Hindu being killed in West Bengal and cry wolf as to how no one is talking about it. The video that was shared by Ghanshyam Jangid was downloaded by many others on social media and shared again via their individual social media accounts and pages with the identical text thus resulting in lakhs of views.\n\nThis was also carried by right-wing websites like Hindutva.info thus resulting in many more shares. We have reported how Hindutva.info routinely carries such fake videos like the Mexican video which was portrayed as RSS workers being killed in Kerala.\n\nKindly report this post on Facebook before this causes yet another riot due to a fake video.
