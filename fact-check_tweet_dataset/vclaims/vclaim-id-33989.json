A Facebook user asked people to zoom into the picture and read the placard.\n\nA prominently circled placard in the image reads, \u201c\u0915\u0948\u092c \u0939\u091f\u093e\u0913 \u0907\u0938 \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0915\u094b \u092e\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0932\u093f\u092e \u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930 \u092c\u0928\u093e\u0913\u0902 (Remove CAB and make the country a Muslim nation -translated)\u201d.\n\nA few more individuals on Twitter posted the same image with a similar narrative.\n\nWith a Google search with keywords, \u201cPriyanka Gandhi protest\u201c, Alt News found several images of the Congress leader at a sit-in-protest led by the Congress party in solidarity with the students of Jamia Millia Islamia and several other universities which opposed the Citizenship Amendment Act 2019. Gandhi can be seen wearing the same attire as in the viral image.\n\nWe then searched for images and videos from the same protest and found that the placard held by a woman in a black dress actually reads, \u201c\u0932\u093e\u0920\u0940-\u0917\u094b\u0932\u0940 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0930\u094b\u091c\u093c\u0917\u093e\u0930-\u0930\u094b\u091f\u0940 \u0926\u094b (Not lathis and bullets but employment and food -translated)\u201d.\n\nThe text is clearly visible in the zoomed-in screenshot of the image posted below.\n\nIn the comparison below, we compared an original image taken from a similar angle but a different time-frame with the morphed photo. The similarities are evident.\n\nIn conclusion, a morphed image of Priyanka Gandhi sitting on a protest along with party workers is circulating on social media to a false claim that one of the protesters was holding a placard that they are against \u201cCAB\u201d because they want this country to become a \u2018Muslim Rashtra\u2019.", "lang": "en"}
