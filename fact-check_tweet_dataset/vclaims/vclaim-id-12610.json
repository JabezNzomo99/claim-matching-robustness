Gen. Michael Flynn \u2014 President Trump\u2019s former national security adviser. It has not. Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his post-election conversations with a top Russian government official.\n\nThe Geller Report published an item on Nov. 5 that begins: \u201cIt was all a big fat lie \u2014 a coup against the President that continues to this very day. But the real criminals \u2014 Hillary Clinton and co. \u2014 escape justice.\u201d The next three paragraphs are identical to a Jan. 24, 2017, story in the New York Post that carried the headline, \u201cFBI clears Michael Flynn in probe linking him to Russia.\u201d The Geller Report used the same headline.\n\nBut Geller disregards developments that have occurred since the New York Post story appeared nearly 22 months ago.\n\nThat New York Post story was based on Washington Post article from a day earlier that said FBI agents investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election had \u201creviewed intercepts of communications\u201d in December 2016 between Flynn, then an adviser to the president-elect, and Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the U.S. at the time. Citing U.S. officials, the Washington Post reported that the FBI \u201chas not found any evidence of wrongdoing or illicit ties to the Russian government.\u201d\n\nHowever, a day after the Washington Post published its story, the FBI interviewed Flynn about his conversations with Kislyak. And months later, on Dec. 1, 2017, the special counsel\u2019s office announced that Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to FBI agents during that interview, as we\u2019ve explained in our article about \u201cMichael Flynn\u2019s Russia Timeline.\u201d\n\nDuring a Dec. 22, 2016, call with Kislyak, according to the special counsel\u2019s office, Flynn asked Russia to delay or defeat a U.N. Security Council resolution \u2014 something Flynn initially denied to the FBI. In another call, seven days later, Flynn discussed sanctions the Obama administration placed on Russia for its interference in the election. The special counsel\u2019s office said that Flynn asked Russia to refrain from escalating the situation; Kislyak agreed that Russia would \u201cmoderate its response to those sanctions\u201d following the request. When interviewed about that second call by the FBI, Flynn denied making that request and couldn\u2019t recall if Kislyak had agreed to it.\n\nWhen Flynn agreed to plead guilty for lying about those conversations, he said in a statement that he would cooperate with the special counsel\u2019s investigation. He is scheduled to be sentenced next month.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nGeller, Pamela. \u201cFBI clears Michael Flynn in probe linking him to Russia.\u201d Geller Report. 5 Nov 2018.\n\nOrder No. 3915-2017: Appointment of Special Counsel to Investigate Russian Interference with the 2016 Presidential Election and Related Matters.
