A post is going viral on social media that claims that an Australian man has named his Apple Company after Indian PM Narendra Modi. In our investigation we found that this news is wrong, the name of this Australian company is indeed Modi Apple, but it is not named after Indian Prime Minister. The company is in fact named after Italian painter Amedeo Modigliani.\n\nThe viral post comprises of 4 photos along with a description that roughly translates to \u201cMelbourne, Australia: A man named Filipino was so inspired by Narendra Modi that he named his apple company after his name, these apples will soon be available in India\u201d.\n\n1) Australian man named his company \u2018Modi Apple\u2019 after the name of Indian Prime Minister.\n\n2) These apples will soon be available in India too.\n\nIn order to investigate this post, we decided to check these two claims one-by-one. We first searched \u2018Modi Apple\u2019 on the Internet. On the first page itself we found both\u2019 Modi Apple\u2019s\u2019 Facebook page and website.\n\nWhen we opened the about us section of Modi\u2019s Facebook page, we found that it is clearly stated here that \u201cThe name (Modi Apple )comes from the world of art, more exactly from Amedeo Modigliani, an artist born in Livorno and affectionately known as Mod\u00ec to his friends. \u201c\n\nWe also called Australia-based Modi Apple\u2019s office and we were told that \u201cAs written in the company\u2019s website, the name of Modi Apple is derived from Italian artist Amadeo Modigliani.\u201d\n\nWe then investigated the second claim, and found that this claim is correct. The news section on Modi apple\u2019s website says that \u201cthe Chairman of CIV \u2013 Consorzio Italiano Vivaisti \u2013 Pier(Modi Apple) Filippo Tagliani and the Director of I.G. INTERNATIONAL Pvt Ltd Tarun Arora have officially signed a Commercial Partnership Agreement to develop the Mod\u00ecciv\u2122 apple brand in India.\u201d\n\nIn this context, we also found a story on Economic Times, which states that \u201cModi apples, a popular apple variety from Italy has officially entered India by appointing IG International as its authorised distributor for the country.\u201d\n\nLet us tell you that all the photos in the viral post have been taken from Modi Apple, Australia\u2019s Facebook page.\n\nThis post was shared by a Facebook user Tinkle Gupta on a Facebook page named RSS. This page is not RSS\u2019 official page. On scanning this profile, we found that according to the intro of Tinkle Gupta, he is a fan of a particular politician. He is a resident of Chhattisgarh and has more than 2000 Facebook friends.\n\nConclusion: In our investigation, we found that the viral post is wrong. In fact, the name of this Australian company is indeed Modi Apple, but it is not named after the Indian Prime Minister. The company is actually named after an Italian painter Amedeo Modigliani.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right.
