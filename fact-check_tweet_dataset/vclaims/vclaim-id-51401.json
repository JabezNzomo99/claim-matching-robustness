The warning inscription was emphasised in red.\n\nThe ICIR reached out to Kayode Adegoke, the Spokesperson for NIMC, and in the phone interview he acknowledged the existence of the app.\n\nHe also stated that he has it downloaded on his mobile.\n\nHe however, dismissed the viral message being shared on WhatsApp platforms, saying it did not originate from NIMC.\n\n\u201cThe message is not from us,\u201d Adegoke said. \u201cWe have our official communication channels which include but not limited to our website, press releases or official social media platforms. Anything outside that is not from us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe general public should be aware so that they won\u2019t be swindled of their money.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are building up the mobile applications where Nigerians can actually access their cards. We are doing the pre-trial stage but we have never asked anyone to supply their BVN number or Tax number or so,\u201d Adegoke explained.\n\nHe added that \u201cWe notice that some unscrupulous elements want to manipulate Nigerians. It is still being processed, that\u2019s why it has not been officially launched.\u201d\n\nBased on the available findings, the claim about the mobile application belonging to the NIMC is TRUE but it has not been launched as it is still at the pretrial stage.\n\nHowever, the claim that the message originated from NIMC is FALSE.", "lang": "en"}
