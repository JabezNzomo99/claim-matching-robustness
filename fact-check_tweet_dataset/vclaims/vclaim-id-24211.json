Roy Cooper recently vetoed a bill that would place new penalties on any medical professional who willingly allows infants to die if they survived an abortion.\n\nCooper and most Democrats said the legislation brings needless government rules into complicated medical situations.\n\nRepublicans, though, say the rules are necessary. And on April 30, the state Senate voted to override Cooper\u2019s veto.\n\nAfterward, legislator Dan Bishop, who\u2019s running for Congress in North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District, took credit for advancing the override.\n\n\"I was proud to cast the deciding vote tonight in the State Senate to end infanticide in North Carolina, over liberal Governor Roy Cooper\u2019s veto,\" Bishop posted on his Facebook page and website.\n\nFirst, Bishop\u2019s claim that he voted to \"end infanticide\" in North Carolina is misleading because current federal laws already protect newborns born alive through the course of an abortion, as PolitiFact reported last month.\n\nSince we\u2019ve already written about that, let\u2019s look instead at Bishop\u2019s claim that he was the \"deciding vote.\" We believe this statement warranted attention because it suggests Bishop was a swing vote and that the bill\u2019s fate depended on Bishop and Bishop alone.\n\nThis is a type of claim that PolitiFact has been reviewing for years. It\u2019s common for politicians to try to take sole credit for a law\u2019s success or, conversely, for their opponents to try to assign someone sole blame.\n\nBut often those claims are exaggerated, and that\u2019s the case with Bishop too. Thirty votes were needed for the override and Bishop provided one of the predicted Republican votes. But the GOP-authored bill wouldn\u2019t have advanced without the help of a Democrat.\n\nTo override a veto, the state House and state Senate each need three-fifths of their present members to support the idea. On April 30, the Senate\u2019s override vote was 30 in favor and 20 opposed \u2014 meaning the effort advanced by one vote.\n\nWhile Bishop\u2019s vote mathematically was important, it\u2019s misleading for him to say he cast the \"deciding\" vote.\n\nGerry Cohen, former special counsel to the N.C. General Assembly and longtime legislative staffer, described Bishop\u2019s claim as a \"non sequitur.\"\n\n\"I suppose with an oral roll call vote you could definitively say who the 30th yes vote was,\" Cohen said. \"Otherwise it\u2019s puffery (though) not incorrect from a technical sense.\"\n\nIn North Carolina, key votes are typically conducted electronically at the same time. It\u2019s not like an elementary school classroom where a teacher calls out each student\u2019s name, one by one. So there\u2019s rarely the kind of drama that the late U.S. Sen. John McCain generated in 2018, when he walked to the center of the Senate floor and made a thumbs-down motion to vote against a \"skinny repeal\" of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s voting procedure is more like a silent auction, or the final round of the television show \"Jeopardy!\" The chamber is silent, and senators are given time to press a button. Votes are anonymous until the results are displayed on a screen. And the screen doesn\u2019t show results until each vote is cast.\n\nThe system is structured in a way that it rarely places pressure on any one legislator. However, lawmakers sometimes bring the spotlight upon themselves by voting out-of-lockstep with their party, by trying to change their vote, or both.\n\nIn 2012, for instance, fracking was legalized in North Carolina after a Democrat from Charlotte accidentally pushed the wrong button and voted with Republicans. Rep. Becky Carney made the mistake late at night.\n\nJust after the vote, her voice could be heard on her microphone, saying \"Oh my gosh. I pushed green,\" WRAL reported. She asked Thom Tillis, who\u2019s now a U.S. Senator but at the time was NC House Speaker, if she could change her vote. Changing votes is sometimes allowed, but Tillis said no.\n\nIn the vote Bishop referenced, Sen. Don Davis of Pitt County received the most attention. He was the only Democrat who voted with Republicans to support the override, giving the GOP the one vote it needed to advance the override effort.\n\nAs of May 8, Cooper\u2019s veto still stands because the House hasn\u2019t taken an override vote.\n\nBishop said he \"cast the deciding vote\" to override a vetoed \"born-alive\" bill. His vote was important because, without it, the override effort would fail. But it would have also failed without any of the other 29 votes. So it\u2019s misleading for Bishop to say he cast the \"deciding\" vote. We rate this claim Mostly False.\n\nThis story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters\u2019 Lab and PolitiFact.
