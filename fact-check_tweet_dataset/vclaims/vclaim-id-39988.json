The number $32.6 trillion is often used, but the study actually offers a possible range of $32.6 trillion to $38.8 trillion for the years 2022 to 2031.\n\nThe Sanders campaign has cited this study to claim his plan would lower health-care costs, but the author, Charles Blahous, has publicly and persistently insisted the campaign has misinterpreted his findings. In particular, he says the \u201clower-bound\u201d estimate is unrealistic because it assumes Sanders would be successful in reducing payments for treatments now covered by private insurance by 40 percent.\n\nRoughly speaking, there are two parts of the $50 trillion in national health expenditures that would be affected by a Medicare-for-all plan: $17 trillion in current government spending on Medicare, Medicaid, Obamacare and the like, and $26 trillion in spending by households, employers and states. (Another $7 trillion would not be affected.) Medicare-for-all would essentially take over the state, employer and household spending, so that\u2019s the key variable.\n\n\u201cBottom line is that it is incorrect to say that the plan is cheaper than current law, even on a national basis,\u201d Blahous said. \u201cMost of the range of possible outcomes would have total NHE increasing under Medicare-for-all. The increase occurs primarily because of the increase in the numbers of those covered as well as in the generosity of coverage, both of which would spur additional demand and, other things being equal, additional spending.\u201d\n\nThat study, by Gerald Friedman, an economics professor at UMass-Amherst, found health spending would decline over a 10-year period from a baseline of $46.8 trillion in health spending between 2019 and 2029 under six scenarios. The most optimistic model, assuming Americans shared some costs with the government, shows a decline in spending to about $34 trillion, or 28 percent. But a model with no cost-sharing \u2014 Sanders\u2019s plan envisions no out-of-pocket spending except for prescription drugs \u2014 would have national health expenditures of nearly $41 trillion, or a decline of 13.2 percent.\n\n\u201cBernie is overstating things,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cEven with optimistic assumptions about savings realized and a slowdown in growth to Canadian or European growth rates and an actuarial value of 87 percent (not the 96 percent in his program), spending would not decline by $20 trillion, or 40 percent. I am perfectly comfortable in saying that there will be financial savings, savings over-and-above the improvements in health that would come with greater access and improvements in financial stability with universal quality insurance. The benefits of Medicare-for-all are substantial enough that there really is no need to exaggerate.\u201d\n\nThat might have been a logical assumption. During the debate, his staff shared, as the source of the $50 trillion figure, a pair of Washington Post opinion columns that made a similar comparison. But a spokesman has since said that the campaign was not endorsing the analysis in those columns. Instead, he says Sanders was simply pointing to a government estimate for health expenditures over a 10-year period.\n\nSince the spokesman declined to explain why Sanders made the comparison, we are left with a conundrum. It certainly sounded as if he was saying his plan would reduce health-care spending from $50 trillion over 10 years to $30 trillion, even though most studies predict spending will increase. The Washington Post columns originally cited as a source also framed the issue that way.\n\nWe can understand a misfired talking point in the heat of a debate. Regular readers know that we always offer the opportunity to politicians to explain that he or she made an error and then we leave the claim unrated. We don\u2019t try to play gotcha and simply want to inform readers about the facts. (For instance, in response to our queries about a fact check, Biden recently admitted he misspoke about his opposition to the Iraq War.) Similarly, we offered multiple opportunities to the Sanders campaign to explain his statement or acknowledge an honest mistake. The campaign did not respond to that request.", "lang": "en"}
