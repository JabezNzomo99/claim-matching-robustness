The verdict, which fell just hours before the International Women\u2019s Day, is considered \u201chistoric\u201d by some experts and advocacy groups for women\u2019s rights. \u201cThis is a great leap forward for women\u2019s rights in Saudi Arabia,\u201d concludes Jane Austin, spokeswoman for the Women\u2019s Liberation Action Network. \u201cIt may seem too little, too late, but it is truly a milestone event for all women in the region,\u201d she says, visibly excited. \u201cFrom now on, women will be considered as members of the mammal class, whereas before women shared the legal status of an object, similar to that of a home appliance,\u201d she admits.\n\nThe large visible logo visible in the accompanying photograph purportedly showing the panel of Saudi scientists indicates that it was taken at the World Government Summit, a yearly event held in Dubai as a \u201cglobal platform dedicated to shaping the future of government worldwide.\u201d\n\nThe program for the World Government Summit 2016 did not include any Saudi scientists listed among the event\u2019s speakers, nor any presented reports touching on the biological classification of women.\n\nNot surprisingly, this unusual news about a ruling from \u201ca panel of Saudi scientists\u201d was reported exclusively by World News Daily Report, a well-known purveyor of fake news whose disclaimer says:\n\nWNDR assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website \u2013 even those based on real people \u2013 are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.", "lang": "en"}
