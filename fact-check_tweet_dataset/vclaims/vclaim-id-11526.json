This means it\u2019s not an up-to-date reflection of the situation regarding the cost of an extended transition period. However, it still accurately reflects our assessment of the claim\u2014based on information available to both us and the claimant at the time.\n\n\u00a339 billion is the upper estimate of the amount that the UK may pay to the EU, following Brexit, to cover outstanding EU budget contributions and other financial commitments and liabilities. We\u2019ve written about this \u201cdivorce bill\u201d in detail here.\n\nThe claim that extending the Brexit transition period could cost an extra \u00a315 billion a year on top of that is newer. It has been circulated by various newspapers and MPs in recent weeks, but the original source of the figure is unclear.\n\nSo we decided to speak to some experts to try and work out how realistic it is.\n\nThe short answer is that we don\u2019t know how much we would have to pay if the transition period was extended: it would be dependent on negotiations, and the size of the EU\u2019s next budget. However, based on what we do know, \u00a315 billion a year seems a reasonable estimate for the time being. If transition were extended by only a few months and not a whole year (as has been mooted), the sum we owe would fall.\n\nWhat does extending the transition period mean?\n\nWe are formally leaving the EU on 29 March 2019. But once we leave, the plan is for there to be a \u201ctransition period\u201d during which we would have the same obligations as an EU member, but not be represented on EU bodies. The transition period is designed to give the UK and EU more time to negotiate a trade deal which will define our future relationship.\n\nThis proposed transition period (it hasn\u2019t been formally signed off yet) would last until the end of 2020, giving the UK and EU 21 months to negotiate a future deal. Experts have suggested that this is \"very unlikely\" to be enough time to conclude all necessary talks.\n\nRecently, the Prime Minister suggested that the transition period could be extended by \u201ca matter of months\u201d. This remains a proposal, and is not an official position committed to by the UK or EU.\n\nExtending the transition period would almost certainly mean paying more to the EU\n\nDuring the transition period, the UK will still be part of the EU\u2019s structures (for example being part of the single market and customs union), and continue to contribute to the EU\u2019s budget until the end of 2020. That\u2019s when the current EU budget ends\u2014these run in seven year cycles.\n\nThese contributions make up part of our \u201cdivorce bill\u201d with the EU. The total bill is expected to be \u00a335-39 billion, though that\u2019s not been fully agreed yet. As well as outstanding budget contributions, this money also covers financial commitments and liabilities we have towards the EU up to the end of 2020 and beyond.\n\nBut what happens if the transition period is extended past 2020, as the Prime Minister suggested? Brexit specialists at the Institute for Government, an independent think tank, told us that it\u2019s unlikely the EU would let us stay a part of its structures beyond 2020 without continuing to contribute to its overall budget. Recent statements from the EU suggest as much.\n\nWhat exactly would extending the transition period cost?\n\nThere isn\u2019t a clear figure, but \u00a315 billion a year seems a reasonable estimate based on what we know at the moment. The best we can do for now is look at the UK\u2019s existing budget contributions.\n\nIn 2017, the UK government paid just under \u00a313 billion into the EU budget. In the previous three years, it paid between roughly \u00a313 billion and \u00a315 billion in cash terms. That doesn\u2019t factor in what we get back in terms of EU spending on the UK though. Once we deduct this, the UK\u2019s \u201cnet\u201d contribution was just under \u00a39 billion in 2017, and between roughly \u00a310 billion and \u00a311 billion in the three years before that.\n\nBut we also get a discount on these contributions, known as the \u201crebate\u201d. This tends to be worth around \u00a34-5 billion a year.\n\nThe EU has said we would lose our rebate if we ended up a part of the EU\u2019s next budget\u2014which is what would happen if we remained in transition after 2020. This is in line with an EU proposal to get rid of all the rebates it gives to its members\u2014including Denmark and the Netherlands\u2014over the course of the next budget. Even if affected member states resist the proposal, none are likely to fight the UK\u2019s corner. The Institute for Government told us that, given this picture, it could be very difficult for the UK to hold onto its rebate if the transition period is extended beyond the end of 2020.\n\nWithout a rebate, our typical net annual contribution to the EU\u2019s budget could be around \u00a315 billion, assuming of course we remained in transition for a year. If it was only a few months, then the sum would be less.\n\nA couple of factors could change that though\n\nThe main issue which could change this is the total size of the next EU budget, and therefore what the UK would have to pay in.\n\nIf we extended the transition period and remained in the EU past 2020, our contributions would have to be calculated against the EU\u2019s new budget for 2021-27. We don\u2019t yet know how big this will be: the EU has proposed that it will be bigger (even with the UK leaving), but a number of members are reportedly resistant to that idea. The Institute for Government told us that the UK\u2019s budget contribution would probably rise or fall in line with the overall EU total.\n\nThe EU is, of course, planning its next budget without the UK as a part of it, so that could further complicate how our contributions will be calculated. Ultimately, the exact sum we owe would be finalised in negotiations between the UK and EU.", "lang": "en"}
