No, that's not true: The neo-soul singer herself has said the words in a viral social meme aren't hers.\n\nThe meme appeared in a post (archived here), published on Facebook on June 26, 2020, under the title \"GramFam has spoken.\" It said:\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nBadu let fans know that those are not her thoughts or beliefs in an Instagram post shared on June 29, 2020. Erykah Badu said,\"I didn't say those words attached to my picture. Nice picture tho.\"\n\nShe said she understands the frustration being conveyed in the statement falsely attributed to her, but she also encourages people to direct their energy in more useful ways.\n\n\"THE SHAMING TACTIC \" Tho I understand the frustration in the sentiment of the authors statement it is a misdirection of energy. If The \"rappers\" to whom this statement references are victims of the same society that fed their communities left-overs of capitalism and Murder, then the author is requiring \"UN WELL\" people to do \"WELL\" things. People evolve at their own rates ...EVEN when they are SHAMED in to behaving a certain way to gain respect or acceptance from the HIVE . There are artist who have a true passion for THE WORK. There are others who pretend to be activists for credibility. There are artists -activists who you will NEVER see on social media at all OR those who ARE on social platforms that do not have the NEED to be seen as activists, yet do THE WORK. The talk of KILLING will stop when KILLING stops just as the talk of LIBERATION will stop when there is no longer a need. I guess what I am saying is AIM YOUR GUNS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. These are my observations. But I didn't say those words attached to my picture. Nice picture tho . \ud83d\ude09 This statement does not serve as a PARDON for any ones behavior Nor as a glorification of any ones actions. -eb Thanks.", "lang": "en"}
