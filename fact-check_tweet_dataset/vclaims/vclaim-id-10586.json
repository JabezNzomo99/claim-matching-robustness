Let us stop propounding how mad this all is, but instead, do something.\n\nOf course, this putative 1929 statement was of interest in 2016 because it seemed to many to so aptly describe Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Too aptly, to some skeptics, who began to question who \u201cLiselotte H\u00fcbner\u201d was.\n\nThe image was first posted to the Facebook page of Sebastian Mueller-Soppart on 22 February 2016:\n\nAccording to Sebastian Mueller-Soppart, Liselotte H\u00fcbner was a woman who spent time in a concentration camp after voicing her opinion about Adolf Hitler. She was also Sebastian\u2019s grandmother:\n\nSebastian admitted that the quote, as lyrical as it is, may not be entirely accurate, as there is no way to determine exactly what Liselotte H\u00fcbner might have said back in 1929:\n\nIn other words, this quote is a modern translation of someone else\u2019s recollection of what a third party reportedly said over eighty years ago. As such, while the general sentiment it expresses may be accurate, the specific wording used may be much more reflective of 21st century American politics than 1920s-era German politics.", "lang": "en"}
