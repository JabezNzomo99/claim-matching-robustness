Bernie Sanders was arrested in 1963 for \u201cthrowing eggs\u201d at black civil rights protesters. He was arrested while protesting on behalf of civil rights.\n\nA black-and-white photograph from 1963 shows a young Bernie Sanders being arrested by Chicago police officers. Wearing thick frame glasses and hunching over in apparent resistance, the future senator appears to be escorted away from a throng of people by two officers.\n\nThat photo emerged in 2016, when the Chicago Tribune located a negative of the picture in its archives and Sanders\u2019 2016 presidential campaign positively identified the individual as the Vermont senator, who graduated from the University of Chicago in 1964.\n\nIn the days since Sanders announced another run for the presidency, however, viral Facebook posts have shared the photo with a false narrative about the circumstances surrounding the arrest.\n\n\u201cIn 1963 Bernie Sanders was arrested for throwing eggs at black civil rights protestors,\u201d the posts read. \u201cThis is the side of Bernie Sanders that CNN and the Fake News Media don\u2019t want you to know.\u201d\n\nWhen the Tribune reported on the photo in 2016, it also cross-referenced the known details about the photo (when and where it was shot) with a January 1964 article that reported on the dispositions of 159 people \u201carrested during demonstrations at four locations during which they protested alleged segregation in the city\u2019s public schools.\u201d\n\nThat article identified a \u201cBernard Sanders, 21\u201d who was \u201carrested Aug. 12 at 74th and Lowe and charged with resisting arrest.\u201d He was found guilty and fined $25. In other words, Sanders was not arrested for harassing the demonstrators, as the Facebook posts claim. He was one of the civil rights demonstrators.\n\nAt the university, Sanders for a time led the campus chapter of Congress of Racial Equality, or CORE. Under Sanders, according to the campus newspaper the Chicago Maroon, the organization participated in a nationwide protest of Howard Johnson restaurants for its \u201crefusal to adopt a non-discriminatory policy in the south.\u201d\n\nThe arrest photo\u2019s emergence was welcomed by Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign. Some had previously questioned whether another picture, from a 1962 sit-in over discrimination in the university\u2019s housing policies, was actually of him \u2014 or of another student. But the photographer Danny Lyon, who took that photo and others of Sanders, confirmed it was the senator.\n\nSanders\u2019 college activism is something he still cites today. In a recent tweet promoting a rally in Chicago, he wrote, \u201cMy time at the University of Chicago, at the height of the Civil Rights Movement, changed my life and helped shape me into the person I am today.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nMurphy, Tim. \u201cHere\u2019s What Bernie Sanders Actually Did in the Civil Rights Movement.\u201d Mother Jones. 11 Feb 2016.", "lang": "en"}
