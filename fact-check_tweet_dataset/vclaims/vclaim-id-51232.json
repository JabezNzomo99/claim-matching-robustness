One prominent hoax claimed the elections were due to be staged on November 25, not November 24. Another hoax falsely claimed voters could select more than one pro-government candidates. Some social media posts even urged voters to write additional notes of support for candidates on their ballot sheets, which risked making their vote invalid. Despite the disinformation, the elections saw a record turnout and huge gains for pro-democracy candidates.\n\nThe posts were circulating online ahead of Hong Kong\u2019s district council elections, which saw pro-democracy candidates win an overwhelming majority of 452 elected seats in the city\u2019s 18 district councils.\n\nHere is an AFP report about the elections, which were held during the sixth consecutive month of unrest in the semi-autonomous territory.\n\nThe election results were published here on the official election website.\n\nOne misleading post was published here on Facebook on November 22, 2019. It has been shared more than 2,500 times.\n\nThe post wrongly suggests the elections were due to be held on November 25, not November 24.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nTranslated from traditional Chinese to English, the red text on the image says: \u201cStop destruction, rebuild Hong Kong\". Words underneath it state: \"November 25, vote for DAB\".\n\nThe DAB, or Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, is a pro-Beijing political party in the city.\n\nThe same image was published here on Facebook and here on Twitter with a similar claim.\n\nAnother image published here on Facebook on November 22 also falsely claimed the elections would be held on two separate days for supporters of the pro-Beijing and pro-democracy blocs.\n\nThe post has been shared more than 180 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe traditional Chinese-language text on the image translates to English as: \u201cToday, reliable news about the two-day elections had arrived. November 25 is for those voting for the pro-establishment camp, and November 24 for supporters of the pro-democracy camp. This measure is implemented to avoid violent clashes. \n\n #PleaseMakeSuretoSendThistoFamilyMembers\n\n #ShareasYouSee\u201d.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption translates to English as: \u201cEmergency\n\n Please share with your family members\n\n 25/11 vote for DAB\n\n Good people will have rich blessings\u201d.\n\nThe same image was also published here on Facebook with a similar claim.\n\nA third image of a purported ballot sheet was published here on Facebook on November 21, 2019, encouraging voters to vote for more than one candidate in the elections.\n\nThe post\u2019s traditional Chinese-language caption translates to English as: \u201cVote for multiple pro-establishment candidates. If one fails, another can still make up for it\n\n Turn one vote into three, greatly increase our chances to kick the yellow ribbons out \n\n \u201c#SupportProEstablishment #SaveLivelihood\n\n \u201cPeacefulHongKong #ComingSoon\u201d.\n\nThe blue text on the image translates to English as: \u201cVote multiple times on one ballot paper, stop violence and chaos!\" At the bottom of it, a message alongside a thumbs-up sign states: \"Work together and kick pro-democracy candidates out of the council\".\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe image shows a red cross over the box for the pro-democracy party Alliance for True Democracy.\n\nThe three boxes beneath it are assigned for pro-Beijing groups the DAB, Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions and New People's Party, and the purported candidates' names were replaced with: \u201cProtect society\u201d; \u201cCherish homeland\u201d and \u201cAdmire police\u201d. A red arrow has been placed next to each \"candidate\"\u2019s name, and a red tick in each of the parties' boxes.\n\nThe same image was also published here on Facebook. It received more than 2,000 shares.\n\nA fourth misleading image was published here on Facebook with a message that says: \u201cShare quickly\u201d. It has been shared more than 740 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe image\u2019s simplified Chinese-language text translates to English as: \u201cIgnore the pro-democracy candidates during the elections, all in all, when voting for the pro-establishment heroes, remember to write 'add oil' or 'support' on the ballot paper after stamping it to cheer for the pro-establishment camp! And you should choose more than one pro-Beijing candidates! Make sure they are all elected!\n\nThe same image also appeared here on Facebook with a similar claim.\n\nAll of the claims in the misleading posts are false.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s official election website states here the 2019 district council elections were held on November 24, 2019.\n\nThe voting regulations state in part: \u201cVote for ONE candidate only on the ballot paper.\n\n\u201cYou must use the chop provided. Do NOT use a pen or any other means to mark or amend your ballot paper. This will render your vote invalid.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the voting instructions:\n\nJohnny Patterson, director of human rights group Hong Kong Watch, said the online disinformation was evidence of \u201cunderhand tactics\u201d deployed in the elections.\n\n\"Regarding new reports of internet disinformation to deter voting, underhand tactics are regularly part of Hong Kong's elections and it is vital that the electoral process is cleaned up,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, these legitimate concerns should not be allowed to distract from what was an unequivocally emphatic result on November 24 with an unprecedented high turnout despite this disinformation. This results give a clear statement that Hong Kong's silent majority are behind democratic reforms and the introduction of an independent inquiry.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
