Bush, the former Texas governor, saying \"family values do not stop at the Rio Grande\u2026 People are coming to our country to do jobs that Americans won\u2019t do to be able to feed their families. And I think there\u2019s a humane way to recognize that, at the same time protect our borders,\" Bush said, \"and at the same way to make sure we don\u2019t disadvantage those who have stood in line for years to become a legal citizen.\"\n\nTodd asked: \"Do you agree with that statement?\"\n\nAbbott replied: \"In a way I understand this even more powerfully because my wife is going to be the first Hispanic first lady in the history of Texas. And Texas has had a long tradition of uniting the Hispanic culture with Texas values.\"\n\nAbbott, the state attorney general, talked up his wife making history on the campaign trail in 2014, perhaps to good effect.

Notably too, the flags that have flown over Texas include the banners of Spain and Mexico.\n\nAnd has there previously not been a Hispanic first lady of Texas? Not since statehood, it appears.\n\nBut we started our look into Abbott's claim by looking into the next first lady\u2019s roots.\n\nThe next First Lady\n\nAbbott aides didn\u2019t respond to our inquiries into how Abbott decided his wife was breaking ground.\n\nWe looked for clues on , the online genealogy database, which led us to information credited to the indicating Cecilia Phalen Abbott, the governor-elect\u2019s wife, is the granddaughter of Mexican immigrants--Leonara and Augustine Segura--who settled in San Antonio before 1935.\n\nWe shortly confirmed the validity of those census on a federal website that included a chart showing Maria de la Luz Segura, Cecilia Abbott\u2019s mother, was born in 1935 in San Antonio, where she lived with her parents, grandparents and siblings.\n\nWe also uncovered for Cecilia Abbott\u2019s father, William Joseph Phalen--born in Michigan in 1933 to parents from Ohio and New York and then raised in Houston.
