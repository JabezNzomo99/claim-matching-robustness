The global information organization, which operates in a number of countries and languages on the Web and TV, has begun displaying \u201cpolitical\u201d ads on electronic billboards deployed in busy Russian airports\n\nThe message board at St. Petersburg\u2019s Pulkovo International Airport has a sophisticated and sleek appearance, and sits atop a phone charging booth in the terminal.\n\nThe RT message boards present something of fact-checking challenge, given that some of the messages seem to be tongue-in-cheek admissions of RT\u2019s role in Russian propaganda.\n\nWe chose the two that seemed to be aimed directly at two Western governments\u2019 conclusions that Russia influenced their elections:\n\u2022 \u201cThe president of France slanders us because we slander him.\u201d\n\nDuring the 2017 French presidential election, the eventual winner, Emmanuel Macron, accused Russian hackers of attempting to derail his candidacy. Several cybersecurity research firms backed the Macron campaign\u2019s allegations, linking hacking efforts to the Russian-affiliated group sometimes known as \u201cFancy Bear.\u201d Polygraph.info debunked a Russian denial.\n\nThe message on the American election is in English:\n\u2022 \u201cThe longer you watch, the more upset Hillary becomes.\u201d\n\nIn the 2016 presidential election campaign, U.S. intelligence agencies concluded the Russian government injected itself into the campaign by releasing emails hacked from Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. In January 2017, the Director of National Intelligence presented an unclassified version of a report that concluded President Putin \u201cordered an influence campaign\u2026 to undermine public faith\u201d in the U.S. election and \u201charm her (Clinton\u2019s) electability and potential presidency.\u201d\n\nOther messages seen in the St. Petersburg airport, in Russian and some in English:\n\u2022 \u201cDo you know how we refer to the CI\n\u2022 \u201cCome closer and find out who we\u2019re planning to hack next.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cMissed a plane? Lost an election? Blame it on us.\n\nThe online American news organization BuzzFeed concluded in July that the RT airport electronic billboards by \u201ca propaganda wing for the Russian government\u2026(are) meant to troll Americans and mock allegations that the Kremlin interfered in last year\u2019s elections.\u201d\n\nRT\u2019s apparent attempt at humor created a bit of a stir on Twitter in July, and perhaps that is the goal of the ad campaign, which an RT spokeswoman told BuzzFeed would continue until next year. BuzzFeed reported the ads are also displayed at airports in Moscow and Sochi.\n\nIn an article in July, RT called its own \"satirical messages\" a \"provocative ad campaign\" and displayed a number of tweets from Democrats who each called themself a \"DNC hack survivor.\" The RT article also quoted tweets from \"a deluge of trolling.\"\n\n\u200bBuzzFeed, which is not a fact check site, reached the same conclusion as Polygraph.info, pointing out that U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russian election interference \u201cdid in fact happen.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
