Let\u2019s check the authenticity of the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Video of Muslims applying their saliva to plates and spoons to spread the coronavirus disease. Fact: The first Coronavirus case in the world was registered in December 2019. But the video is found to exist on social media at least since July 2018. So, the video is an old one and the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe first Coronavirus case in the world was registered in China in December 2019.\n\nThrough reverse image search, the video was found to have existed on the internet at least since July 2018. The video was first posted on Twitter and it was found that the Muslims in the video belonged to \u2018Bohra\u2019 community and they were doing so in the video to not waste food. When searched on Google with specific keywords, the same video was found on \u2018Vimeo\u2019. The description in this video also had the same information about that video.\n\nWhen searched for more information about the \u2018Bohra\u2019 community, an article of news agency \u2013 \u2018The National\u2019 was found. As per this video, the entire Bohra family eats in a single plate \u2018Thaal\u2019 and they have \u2018no-wastage\u2019 policy. So, they do not leave a single grain of rice on their plate when it is taken away. Also, Bohra men are easy to identify as they put white topis (head caps) with golden embroidery.\n\nWhen the head caps of the persons in the video are compared with the head caps worn by Bohra Muslims, they were found to be similar. So, the Muslims in the video belong to Bohra Community and they are licking plates and spoons to not waste food.\n\nTo sum it up, an old video of Bohra Muslims licking plates and spoons to have the leftover food is being shared as \u2018Muslims spreading coronavirus disease\u2019.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
