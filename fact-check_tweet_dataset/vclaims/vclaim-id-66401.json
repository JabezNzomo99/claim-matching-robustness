Scott Walker declares:\n\n\"With a record investment in schools \u2026 we\u2019re putting students first.\"\n\nThe ad, released June 19, 2018, as part of Walker\u2019s campaign to win a third term, has turned some heads. It\u2019s a claim he essentially repeats on the official governor\u2019s website.\n\nIn the run-up to the Aug. 14, 2018, primary election, which pits eight candidates seeking the Democratic nomination, Walker\u2019s spending on schools has been an issue. And it\u2019s likely to be debated ahead of the Nov. 6, 2018, general election, as well.\n\nWhat does \u2018record\u2019 mean?\n\nIn one of our latest fact checks, on a claim by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mahlon Mitchell, we reported that Walker\u2019s first two-year state budget, for 2011-\u201913, cut state funding to schools by nearly $800 million. Since then, Walker has gradually put back more than $1 billion.\n\nBut the initial cut certainly put him in the hole, in terms of achieving \"record\" school funding.\n\nAnd what does Walker -- who has a history of using different phrasing to claim exceptional funding -- mean by \"record,\" anyway?\n\nIn the ad, as Walker begins to speak, words on the screen cite a February 2017 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article for support.\n\nWe found it\u2019s a news article reporting that Walker\u2019s state budget for 2017-\u201919 proposed $11.5 billion over the two years for schools \u2014 a new high, before accounting for inflation, which of course is crucial in comparing dollars over time.\n\nWalker\u2019s campaign confirmed to us the $11.5 billion figure is what Walker relies on in making his \"record investment\" claim.\n\nWhen Walker introduced his 2017-\u201919 budget in February 2017, he made a claim very similar to the one in the new TV ad, saying: \"We are investing more money into education than ever before in the history of Wisconsin.\"\n\nWe rated that claim Mostly False.\n\nWe found that the $11.5 billion is the largest two-year tally in state history -- in raw dollars, but not so when taking into account inflation, based on figures provided to us then by the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance.\n\nThe alliance, which has since merged to become part of the Wisconsin Policy Forum, did calculations for us dating back more than 25 years:\n\nSo, adjusting for inflation, the seven state budgets prior to Walker\u2019s taking office spent more on schools than Walker\u2019s current budget does.\n\nBut, as we found in the earlier fact check, Walker\u2019s statement has only an element of truth, when considering the funding without regard to inflation.\n\nHis claim of a \"record\" suggests a new high mark in real terms. But with inflation, his current school funding is well below that of several other budgets.\n\nWalker says he made \"a record investment in schools.\"\n\nHe refers to the $11.5 billion being spent on kindergarten-through-12th grade schools in his 2017-\u201919 state budget. In raw dollars, that is a record in Wisconsin.\n\nBut inflation, of course, is crucial in measuring dollars over time. On that score, seven state budgets spent more on schools than Walker\u2019s current budget does.\n\nThe governor\u2019s statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, making it Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
