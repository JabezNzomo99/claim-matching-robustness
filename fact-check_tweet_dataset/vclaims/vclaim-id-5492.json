That\u2019s exactly why criminals are putting them up. You and everyone else is used to seeing them on the backs of doors and walls. But now new information has come to light. And it\u2019s terrifying. These coat hooks are actually carrying something that can ruin your life. Don\u2019t let their unassuming appearance trick you. Many of these coat hooks are actually a high-tech spy camera\u2026\n\nAlthough the item claimed \u201cmany\u201d hotel hooks harbored these cameras, it went on to cite a 31 May 2016 Facebook post published by the Monroe County Sheriff\u2019s Office in Key West:\n\nAccording to that warning, police in Key West located three cameras in womens\u2019 restrooms in separate locations in May 2016, but while they were hidden in coat hooks, none of the cameras were located in private hotel rooms (or even in hotels at all):\n\nIn all three incidents, miniature cameras hidden in coat hooks were found mounted on the walls in the women\u2019s restrooms. They were found at Anne\u2019s Beach on May 26th, the Circle K Store at the 99.8 mile marker of Highway U.S. One on May 28th and in the women\u2019s bathroom at Harry Harris Park in Tavernier today. The coat hooks mounted in all three locations are identical to devices available for purchase on line, sold by various companies as \u201chome security devices\u201d. Detectives have notified Monroe County Public Works and Islamorada Public Works and asked them to check all the bathrooms at county and city facilities; Sheriff Rick Ramsay wants to let everyone know so they also can be on the lookout.\n\nAlthough it was certainly possible such hooks could be mounted in hotel rooms by predators, the occurrence didn\u2019t appear to be a regular one. We found a tiny number of hotel-related camera reports since surveillance equipment of that nature was available. A 2015 incident in England made headlines due to the its rarity:\n\nHarmony Hachey, 23, was using the cubicle when she noticed a small electronic device hidden behind the vent. On closer inspection, she realised it was in a hidden camera pointing directly at where she was standing naked in the shower. The police are now investigating the incident, which has left Miss Hachey feeling \u201cviolated\u201d. A force spokesman said the camera was not connected to the caretaker\u2019s room, with a flex left dangling inside the maintenance unit behind the shower. After realising it was a camera, she took several photographs as evidence and alerted hotel staff. When the receptionist investigated, she went to the janitor\u2019s cupboard in the main hallway at the back of the shower. There, she is said to have found a USB cable attached to the camera, but it appeared to be switched off.\n\nIn that case, the camera was concealed behind a vent, not embedded within a fixture of the room. The cheap plastic hooks housing cameras in the viral warning were unlikely to go unnoticed for long in hotel rooms, where unusual unauthorized fixtures would likely be immediately apparent to maintenance.\n\nIt is true that police in Key West issued a warning about spy cameras in public bathrooms in May 2016, but the warning had nothing to do with hotel rooms.", "lang": "en"}
