That\u2019s looking at all countries (including non-EU ones) where at least 100 people got citizenship from an EU member state.\n\nBut this is a very small proportion of the number of citizenships handed out by EU states overall in 2016. Of the nearly one million people granted citizenship to EU states that year, 87% of those were from a non-EU country.\n\nYou can use this Eurostat tool to see how many people from non-EU countries were granted citizenship by an EU state.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t necessarily mean more people are leaving the UK for other EU countries. Estimates for the number of British citizens who emigrated from the UK long-term (for at least a year) do not show a dramatic upturn over the same period.\n\nWe\u2019ve written more about the number of Brits living in the rest of the EU here.\n\nEurostat told us that this data included British citizens who had taken up citizenship of another EU country and become dual citizens, as well as those who had renounced their UK citizenship.\n\nAround 740 people renounced their British citizenship in 2016, up from 430 the year before. This is only granted to applicants who have or are about to become citizens of another country.\n\nEligibility for and treatment of citizenship varies from country to country, and not all countries accept dual citizenship. For example, Norway doesn\u2019t allow it in most cases, although their rules may soon change.\n\nEurostat\u2019s definition of citizenship is the \u201cparticular legal bond between an individual and his or her state, acquired through birth or naturalisation, whether by declaration, choice, marriage or other means according to national legislation\u201d.\n\nThis data only shows how many citizenships were granted in a year, not how many were applied for. Applications can take time to process, for example it can take up to six months to process an application to become a UK citizen, and in some cases longer.\n\nSo some of these applications may have been made before 2016, and without knowing how the granted applications were spread out over the course of the year we can\u2019t say if there was an increase following the EU referendum.\n\nThe BBC\u2019s Reality Check and Radio 4\u2019s More or Less contacted EU countries to find out how many passport applications they received from British citizens in the year before and after the referendum. They found that in the eight EU countries that replied to them the number of applications had increased in the year after the referendum.\n\nThese countries included Ireland, Spain and Sweden. We don\u2019t have the original source of their figures yet, but we\u2019ll report back when we know more.\n\nWe also don\u2019t know where these people were living when they applied for citizenship\u2014they may have been resident in the EU country whose citizenship they applied for or remained in the UK.", "lang": "en"}
