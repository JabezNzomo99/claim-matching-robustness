Paul Bedard, a columnist with the conservative Washington Examiner, recently took up the cry.\n\n\"President Obama is using executive actions to impose gun control on the nation,\" Bedard wrote . \"Targeting the top-selling rifle in the country, the AR-15 style semi-automatic, with a ban on one of the most-used AR bullets by sportsmen and target shooters.\"\n\nWe left phone messages and sent emails several times to Bedard and did not hear back. Our focus is whether Obama is using executive action to impose gun control through a bullet ban.\n\nThere\u2019s some information to unpack here.\n\nWhere the claim comes from\n\nThough we didn\u2019t hear back from Bedard, he\u2019s talking about the ATF\u2019s plan for one particular type of bullet -- a 5.56 mm \"green tip.\" It is found in SS109 and M855 cartridges, and it\u2019s one of the more popular types of ammunition in America, experts told us.\n\nBut this February, the ATF announced a proposal to remove an exemption that allowed gun owners to use this particular kind of ammunition. The agency\u2019s reasoning? It can pierce the sort of body armor often worn by police, and it can be fired from a handgun.\n\nThe ammunition isn\u2019t new, nor is its ability to pierce body armor. What is new is that gun manufacturers are making handguns that use a 5.56 mm \"green tip.\"\n\nThat, ATF says, violates the that aimed to ban armor piercing bullets.\n\n\"The AR-based handguns and rifles utilize the same magazines and share identical receivers,\" the ATF wrote in an . \"These AR-type handguns were not commercially available when the armor piercing ammunition exemption was granted in 1986. To ensure consistency, upon final implementation of the sporting purpose framework outlined above, ATF must withdraw the exemptions for 5.56 mm \"green tip\" ammunition, including both the SS109 and M855 cartridges.\"\n\nThe public has until March 16 to comment on the proposal. ATF will assess those comments and then issue a final ruling. It has not said when it will decide.\n\nNearly 240 members of Congress to ATF opposing the change.\n\nThat\u2019s the background. Now how does that jibe with Bedard\u2019s claim?\n\nBedard called this an executive action by the president. That is a stretch of the common reading of the phrase.\n\nYes, ATF is part of the executive branch, but there\u2019s no evidence this was a decision made by Obama (compared to, say, Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration.)\n\nATF said the proposal came after it received 30 requests for exemptions to permit this sort of bullet in handguns between 2011 and today. Until then, the agency said it had received few such requests. ATF spokeswoman Janice Kemp told PunditFact \"this started with us.\"\n\nWhen this issue came up in a daily , press secretary Josh Earnest said this was an ATF process that was open to public comment. (The comment period ends on March 16.) However, he said the administration supports the proposal as a \"common sense\" step.\n\n\"This seems to be an area where everyone should agree that if there are armor-piercing bullets available that can fit into easily concealed weapons, that it puts our law enforcement at considerably more risk,\" Earnest said.\n\nBedard also said Obama\u2019s actions \"impose gun control on the nation.\"\n\nThat claim is also a stretch of the common meaning of the phrase. The ATF says that banning this particular kind of bullet would leave gunowners with 168 other varieties of bullets to use in the same weapons. Bullets made with copper or lead remain legal under the 1986 law.\n\nSteven Howard, a Michigan attorney and firearms specialist, agrees with ATF\u2019s basic point. \"Instead of shooting this particular cartridge with the forbidden bullet, you\u2019d still have a whole bunch of different ones that you could run through,\" he said. \"A lot of this is fear mongering more than anything else. People are afraid that the list of banned ammo will grow.\" (Howard among them, he told us.)\n\nAnother important point: People who already have these bullets could still use them, but they wouldn\u2019t be able to get any more in the future.\n\nThat said, removing the exemption for this type of bullet would have consequences.\n\nSam Raheb owns Close Focus Research, a ballistics testing lab in California. Raheb said the main impact on shooters is that their ammunition might cost more. \"Before this, you could get a green-point for about 40 cents a round,\" Raheb said. \"If you had to buy a commercial hunting grade cartridge, it could cost you $1 a round.\"\n\nKyle Weaver, the National Rifle Association\u2019s executive director of operations also cited cost . Weaver was asked about the effect on shooter training. \"This is the inexpensive ammo they train with and shoot with,\" Weaver said. \"This is not the high-end stuff. This is what they shoot every day.\"\n\nAnd Wes Mason, manager of technical operations at another testing center, HP White Laboratory, said the proposal wouldn\u2019t address other types of handgun ammunition that could pierce armor and would still be legal under the proposed change.\n\n\"Its counterparts have the same characteristics when you\u2019re talking about piercing body armor,\" Mason said.\n\nThat would make the proposal ineffective in protecting police.\n\nLastly, Bedard said the administration was targeting the rifle version of the AR-15. That is his interpretation. It is the pistol version that drew the ATF\u2019s attention. The agency\u2019s proposal would leave both the pistol and rifle versions untouched, although the ammunition for both would be affected if the \"green tip\" is banned.\n\nBedard said Obama was using executive action to impose gun control through a ban on certain bullets.\n\nAn executive agency, the ATF, has proposed removing an exemption for a specific type of ammunition because gun manufacturers have started selling handguns that fire the rounds. That violates a 1986 federal law, the ATF says, aimed at protecting police from armor piercing bullets.\n\nBedard\u2019s shorthanding this as \"executive action\" is misleading, though Obama does support the proposal.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s worth noting that the ban would not amount to gun control per se; the ATF notes that 168 other varieties of bullets will work in the same weapons. The primary impact would be a higher price for ammunition. And while Bedard says the move targets the rifle version, it is the pistol version and the cartridges it uses that lie at the center of the ATF proposal.\n\nThe claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give another impression. We rate it Mostly False.\n\nNote: This claim was fact-checked as part of a reward to our Kickstarter campaign to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union.
