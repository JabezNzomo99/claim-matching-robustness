A provocative statement threatening to burn India has been attributed to Dalit organisation, Bhim Army\u2019s chief, Chandrashekhar Azad Ravan by Zee News Hindi and News18. According to articles by these two media outlets, speaking at a Dalit event in Muzaffarnagar, Chandrashekhar reportedly said that the crowd is only waiting for his signal, if we can shut down India, we can burn it too. There is a limit to our patience, there is a limit of the atrocities too\u201d (translated) \u201c\u091c\u093f\u0924\u0928\u0940 \u092d\u0940\u095c \u092f\u0939\u093e\u0902 \u0916\u095c\u0940 \u0939\u0948, \u0909\u0938\u0947 \u0938\u093f\u0930\u094d\u092b \u090f\u0915 \u092c\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u0907\u0936\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u0915\u093e \u0907\u0902\u0924\u091c\u093e\u0930 \u0939\u0948. \u0905\u0917\u0930 \u0939\u092e \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u092c\u0902\u0926 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u093e \u091c\u093e\u0928\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902, \u0924\u094b \u0939\u092e \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u0915\u094b \u091c\u0932\u093e\u0928\u093e \u092d\u0940 \u091c\u093e\u0928\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902. \u0939\u092e\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u0938\u092c\u094d\u0930 \u0915\u093e \u0907\u092e\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0928 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0932\u093f\u092f\u093e \u091c\u093e\u090f, \u090f\u0915 \u0938\u0940\u092e\u093e \u0939\u094b\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u0909\u0924\u094d\u092a\u0940\u095c\u0928 \u0915\u0940 \u092d\u0940\u201d\n\nThe reports predictably led to an outrage and reaction on social media. A twitter user, @shrialokmishra, who describes himself as a nationalist, threatened to use the same fire to make a biryani out of those threatening to burn India and feed it to the dogs. \u201cTry it and watch the fun\u201d, he tweeted.\n\nDid Chandrashekhar Azad really make a controversial statement threatening to burn down India? Alt News accessed the video recording of the event to confirm if he indeed made such a statement. His statement can be heard starting 1:30 in the following video clip.\n\nIt is evident from the video clipping that Chandrashekhar said \u201c\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u091a\u0932\u093e\u0928\u093e\u201d and not \u201c\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u091c\u0932\u093e\u0928\u093e\u201d (\u201crun India\u201d and not \u201cburn India\u201d). We slowed the video down and listened to that specific portion of the speech in a loop. In the slow-motion video, it even more clear that Chandrashekhar said \u201cChalana\u201d and not \u201cJalana\u201d.\n\nTo make sure that there was no element of misinterpretion, Alt News also listened to older speeches of Chandrashekhar and found that he has made the same claim about the ability of Bhim Sena to run India (\u201c\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u091a\u0932\u093e\u0928\u093e\u201d) in another speech as well. At 2:07 in the speech below, Chandrashekhar makes the same statement that he\u2019s made in the present rally.\n\nTweeting from his twitter handle, Chandrashekhar slammed Zee TV and News18 for being anti-Dalit and wrote that he had said \u201c\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u091a\u0932\u093e\u0928\u093e\u201d not \u201c\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u091c\u0932\u093e\u0928\u093e\u201d (\u201crun India\u201d and not \u201cburn India\u201d). He also threatened legal action against them.\n\nChandrashekhar also published a video statement on his Twitter account.\n\nIn a conversation with Alt News, Chandrashekhar reiterated that he had been misquoted by Zee News and News18. Till the time of writing the article, there was no official statement or apology from the two media outlets.", "lang": "en"}
