Harmony will obtain not more than 23 seats out of 100 and KPVLV will get 16. To form a governing coalition one needs 51 votes in the parliament (the Saeima).\u201d\n\nPolygraph.info contacted Dr. Bergmane to learn how the press coverage got it wrong. She said the claim by some foreign media that the Harmony party is \u201cpro-Russia\u201d is an oversimplification.\n\n\u201cThe basic idea is that on one hand, Harmony has tried to rebrand itself as a pro-EU social democratic party; it has tried to attract votes of ethnic Latvians,\u201d she said. \u201cOfficially they would not brand themselves a pro-Russian party. The problem is we have their behavior of failing to rally behind the Latvian position on Russian aggression against Ukraine. They are against sanctions on Russia.\u201d\n\nBergmane noted that Harmony once had a cooperation agreement with Russia\u2019s ruling United Russia party, but that prior to the most recent elections, the party broke the agreement and denounced it.\n\nThere is internal tension among the ethnic Russian population in Latvia that occasionally rises to the surface, most recently over a reform that would require high school students be taught mostly in Latvian and not in the Russian language. Russia appealed to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), accusing Latvia of violating the rights of minorities. About one quarter of Latvia's population in ethnic Russian, harkening back to the Soviet era and Moscow's \"aggressive Russification policy.\"\n\nLatvia's education minister defended the reforms as continuing Latvia \"our path toward long-term development of a self-confident and independent nation.\"\n\n\u201cOfficially Harmony is trying to distance itself from Russia,\u201d she said. \u201cI would say this image does not correspond to reality but that\u2019s the image they\u2019re trying project.\u201d\n\n\u200bShe also noted that Harmony is no longer outspoken in opposing EU sanctions against Russia.\n\nBergmane also noted in her Facebook post that the Harmony party has far fewer seats in the Saeima than it needs to form a ruling coalition.\n\n\u201cIf we look at the results, Harmony got the most votes and the highest percentage, but the results are not as good as before,\u201d she said. \u201cHarmony in these elections actually lost one seat and 43,000 votes.\u201d\n\nThe publication BNE Intellinews, Business News Europe, came to a similar conclusion, pointing out that Harmony \u201cwon the most votes in the previous three elections yet it was invariably pushed aside by a coalition government of other parties, a scenario that appears likely following last weekend\u2019s vote.\u201d\n\nBergmane also had a recommendation for international journalists covering elections in Latvia and other small countries: \u201cIf people write about elections in other countries, just Google and read the most basic Wikipedia article. They could also go to the government\u2019s website and read about the electoral system and how it works. It will make the analysis much better and it will be better for the readers. In this case, if you don\u2019t understand how the electoral system works it\u2019s very easy to get the wrong picture.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
