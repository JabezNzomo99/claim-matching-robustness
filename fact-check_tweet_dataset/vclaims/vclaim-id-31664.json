The viral video is a little more than seven years old and not from India.\n\nTamil actor Ajith recently met with an accident in Chennai on the sets of his film Valimai while shooting a bike sequence. This was reported by several news websites as can be read here and here. But the viral video has no connection to the incident.\n\nWith the help of InVID and reverse image search, we found that the same video has been on the Internet since 2012. YouTube channel integraf40 had uploaded the video in 2012 with the caption, Motorbike crashes into boat literally. Epic fail!\n\nOne viewer, BenjaminP, commented on the YouTube video that a bike tester of the French magazine Moto Journal met with this accident during the filming of testing a Yamaha FJR 1300 motorbike.\n\nGetting a clue from the viewer\u2019s comment, we used keyword searches and found reports regarding this incident with the same video published in some websites related to motorbikes and cars in 2012.\n\nAccording to websites such as lematin.ch and TyreSmoke , this freak accident took place when Lolo, a bike tester of French magazine Moto Journal, was filming a testing of Yamaha FJR 1300 at the commune of Saint-Martin-de-R\u00e9 in southwestern France.\n\nWhile taking a turn, the bike\u2019s saddle baggage hit a metal post, sending Lolo and his brand new motorbike down towards the water. The tester experienced minor bruises.\n\nTherefore, we can say that the viral video has no connection to Tamil actor Ajith\u2019s recent accident on the sets.\n\nAlso read: Fact Check: Before Trump\u2019s visit, slum image from Mumbai passed off as Gujarat on social media\n\nAlso read: Fact Check: Before US president\u2019s visit, a sensational Trump lookalike video goes viral", "lang": "en"}
