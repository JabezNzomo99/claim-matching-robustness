The report claimed that the incident happened in quarantine centres in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh.\n\nDelhi\u2019s Nizamuddin was identified as a coronavirus hotspot after several members of Tablighi Jamaat tested positive. They had all attended a meet in mid-March in Nizamuddin Markaz. Since then, governments across states are trying to contact trace attendees for quarantine and testing.\n\n\u201cSDM SN Sharma informed that Jamaatis from different regions were kept in the quarantine ward set up at Jain inter college. [We were] informed that when the Jamaatis were given the food, they threw it and demanded non-vegetarian food. When their demands weren\u2019t completed, they defecated in the open,\u201d stated the report.\n\nThe article shared from Amar Ujala\u2019s official Facebook page garnered close to 4,800 shares.\n\nAnother prominent daily Patrika reported along similar lines: \u201cNon-veg food isn\u2019t served in quarantine centre but jamaatis had asked for non-veg food. When they didn\u2019t get non-veg food, they threw the \u2018pure protein-rich\u2019 food. Not just that, there is an allegation against the jamaatis for defecating in the open.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, this article also quoted [Rampur Maniharan] station in-charge who said that according to their primary investigation, members of Tablighi Jamaat had thrown leftovers behind the building. However, reports of open defecation are yet to be confirmed, the cop was further quoted. The article is no longer available on Patrika\u2019s website and the link to the article now redirects to the website\u2019s homepage.\n\nSaharanpur police investigated the claims about members of Tablighi Jamaat defecating in the open when they weren\u2019t served non-veg food as per their demands. The police found the report to be untrue.\n\nThe police informed that SHO Rampur Maniharan was directed to lead the probe and he found that the claims propagated on social media, newspapers and news channels were completely false.\n\nIn conclusion, two national dailies amplified an unsubstantiated allegation at a time when misinformation against Tablighi Jamaat is widespread. Alt News has been debunking unrelated videos shared to falsely claim that attendees spat on policemen and sneezed inside Nizamuddin mosque.", "lang": "en"}
