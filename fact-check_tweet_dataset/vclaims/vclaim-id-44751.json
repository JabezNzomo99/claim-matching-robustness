AFP found no evidence to support the claim; both the church and the US embassy in Nigeria have rejected the claim as false.\n\nLocal newspaper THISDAY reported on January 31 that David Oyedepo, founder of the Living Faith Church Worldwide, was denied a visa at the Lagos office of the US embassy. Quoting sources, the newspaper said the preacher told the embassy he had been travelling to the United States since the 1980s and \u201chad not violated any rules or committed any crime to have warranted being denied a renewal of his visa\u201d.\n\nThe preacher is also the founder and chancellor of Covenant University, Nigeria\u2019s best university, according to THE rankings. In 1999, he was reported to have built the largest church in the world.\n\nThe story about him was picked up by many newspapers and blogs in Nigeria, some of which we have archived here, here, here, here, here and here.\n\nQuoting THISDAY, Nigerian newspaper PM News said the preacher \u201cwent ballistic\u201d after he was denied a visa.\n\nThe story emerged as US President Donald Trump in late January announced plans to slap immigration restrictions on citizens of six countries including Nigeria. His administration confirmed the ban on February 1 as AFP reported, with the curbs set to come into force on February 22.\n\nIn response, Nigeria\u2019s government said it had created a commission to work with the US to cooperate on the restrictions.\n\nThe Church says Oyedepo renewed his US visa in 2019\n\nAFP\u2019s calls to the church have not been returned. However, church spokesman Sheriff Folarin denied the visa report in a statement reported in the local media.\n\n\u201cWe wish to put it on record and categorically submit that this piece of information is NOT TRUE. At no time was the Bishop denied (a) visa nor did he create a scene at the US consulate in Lagos, as purported by some mainstream and online newspapers,\u201d the church said.\n\n\u201cThe Bishop renewed his visa, last year, without any initial denial or drama, or scene. The Bishop was NOT at the Embassy or Consulate anytime this year. Bishop has been in Canaanland all this week.\n\n\u201cBishop Oyedepo is a good friend of the US government and has a very good relationship with US Embassy and Consulate in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe US embassy says the preacher was not denied visa\n\nThe United States embassy in Nigeria has also denied the allegation.\n\n\u201cBe advised, the reports making the rounds about a visa being denied to Nigerian Bishop Oyedepo are false,\u201d the embassy said via Facebook. \u201cIf you have seen this manufactured item in the media, help defeat this #misinformation by communicating to everyone that it is completely false.\u201d\n\nThe US embassy in Nigeria told AFP in 2019 -- when a similar spate of false news hit the media -- that \u201cunder U.S. law, individual visa records are confidential\u201d and details cannot be provided on any persons affected by US immigration policies.\n\nTHISDAY has now deleted its article.", "lang": "en"}
