Or perhaps even by 720 degrees? Nope, not at all. The story isn't true and is just an English version of a German satire article published in 2013.\n\nThe English version appeared on March 26, 2018 on The Postillon and was titled \"St Paul's Cathedral turned 360 degrees by unidentified perpetrators overnight\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nIt is indeed a prank: a prank article!\n\nHere is the German original from 2013, which was about the Dom in Cologne being rotated by 360 degrees:\n\nAs anyone with a minimum of geometry knowledge knows: rotating something by 360 degrees just means it is back in the original position. For example this post was rotated 360 degrees before publication and we bet you didn't notice it either.\n\nWe wrote about the-postillon.com last week too when they had a viral hit with another satirical story:\n\u2022 Fake News: British Police Did NOT Find Putin's Passport at Scene of Salisbury Poison Attack\n\nThe Postillon has a disclaimer on it's FAQ page that reads:\n\nThe site is the English version of the German original der-postillon.com, another well-known satire website.", "lang": "en"}
