The viral post also claims that Dr. Kafeel Khan will be the director of that hospital.\n\nSeveral Facebook users have posted this message with a caption in Hindi along with a graphic image of the purported hospital with \u201cBabri Hospital\u201d written on it.\n\nThe loose English translation of the Hindi caption written on the viral message reads, \u201cMasterstroke. Sunni Waqf Board has decided to build \u201cBabri Hospital\u201d on the 5-acre land given to them by the Supreme court, where like AIIMS free treatment will be given. Famous doctor Kafeel Khan could be the director of this hospital. A floor would be dedicated to the treatment of the children. Viral diseases like viral meningitis and other diseases will be treated here\u201d.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake-News War Room ( AFWA) found this to be a misleading claim. The Sunni Waqf Board of Uttar Pradesh has called this viral claim completely baseless and untrue. According to the Board so far nothing has been decided about the construction on the 5-acre land.\n\nMultiple users have posted this content on Facebook believing that the Sunni Waqf Board is coming up with Babri Hospital on the 5 acre land in Ayodha.\n\nThe archived versions of the viral posts are saved here, here and here.\n\nIn a historic judgment in November 2019, the Supreme Court cleared the decks for the construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya and also directed centre to allot 5 acres of land to the Sunni Waqf Board for the construction of a Mosque.\n\nThere are several news reports which claim that the trust built by the Waqf Board to oversee the construction of the mosque will also build a hospital, library and an Islamic research center on the 5-acre land.\n\nIndia Today spoke to Syed Mohammad Shoeb, the Chief Executive Officer of UP Sunni Central Board of Waqf, who confirms that the viral post claiming that the Board will build a \u201cBabri hospital\u201d and Dr. Kafeel Khan will be the director is completely fake. \u201cWe are going to take legal action against whoever created and circulated this fake post,\u201d said Syed Mohammad Shoeb.\n\nAccording to the CEO of the Sunni Waqf Board, the board has not taken any final decision about the construction. \u201cThe hospital, library, research centre, that people are talking about are all proposals, we are yet to take any final decision,\u201d he added.\n\nA 15 member trust called the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation Trust has been formed by the UP Sunni Waqf Board, recently.\n\nThe members of the trust will meet soon to discuss these proposals and will come out with final decisions about the construction on the 5-acre land given by the Supreme court.\n\nWith the help of reverse image search, we found the viral image of a hospital with \u201cBabri hospital\u201d written on it has been randomly picked up from a LinkedIn page and photoshopped.\n\nHence, the viral claim made by the Facebook post about the \u201cBabri hospital\u201d being constructed on the 5-acre land is misleading.", "lang": "en"}
