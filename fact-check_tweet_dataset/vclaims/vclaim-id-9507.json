That\u2019s according to research by King\u2019s College London and Oxford University. The majority of these people were in part-time work.\n\nAround 1.2 million emergency food parcels were handed out by the Trussell Trust\u2014which runs the UK\u2019s largest network of food banks\u2014in 2016/17. This isn\u2019t the number of people using food banks. The Trussell Trust thinks that people need an average of two emergency food parcels a year.\n\n84% of those in the survey had \u201cno employment indicated\u201d. This meant that they were either economically inactive\u2014not working because of illness or disability, studying or looking after someone else\u2014or unemployed and looking for work. Around 70% of households surveyed said they received one of the main out-of-work benefits.\n\nThe survey covered over 400 people using Trussell Trust food banks across Great Britain. Those who participated were thought to be fairly representative of all kinds of people using Trussell Trust food banks, but as with any survey, the authors stressed there may be some differences not identified.\n\nThe Trussell Trust has told us before that it doesn\u2019t usually collect information on what kind of jobs people using its services have.", "lang": "en"}
