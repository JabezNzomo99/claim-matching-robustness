He made his escape by swimming through chemical waste, which turned his skin white and his hair green. He took his name from the eponymous playing card and has been arching Batman ever since.\n\nBut something sounded off to this fact-checker, who thought Shapiro had a point about the Joker\u2019s past being mysterious. PolitiFact has written about whether there\u2019s been a female Thor, and whether Wonder Woman\u2019s Gal Gadot or Man of Steel\u2019s Henry Cavill is paid more money, so we have some experience.\n\nIn true geek fashion, we raised this objection with Tapper, saying that the Red Hood origin story was just the one with which people were most familiar.\n\n\"Because it's the true one,\" Tapper replied.\n\nWe\u2019ll see about that.\n\nThe most succinct reply to this came from Nick Valente, a publicist for DC Comics.\n\n\"You are correct, there is no definitive backstory for the Joker,\" he said.\n\nBut wait! Like most comic book plotlines, there\u2019s always room for this story to expand and change.\n\nThe Joker has been around almost as long as Batman himself, first appearing in 1940s Batman No. 1, when the Dark Knight got his own title after starting in Detective Comics a year earlier.\n\nThere have been several iterations of the character, but through the decades he has been portrayed largely as a psychotic killer, bent on antagonizing Batman and the people of Gotham City.\n\nThe Joker had no backstory to speak of until 1951, when the anecdote about the Red Hood that Tapper cited was printed. Versions of this origin have appeared in various forms over the years, with details changed.\n\nGlen Weldon, author of The Caped Crusade: Batman and the Rise of Nerd Culture\u200e, said that DC gave the character an origin story, but that was \"back in the halcyon days before a ravenous fanbase insisted that every random story must calcify into canonical truth.\"\n\nOne of the most famous modern versions of the Red Hood story is Alan Moore\u2019s account in 1988\u2019s The Killing Joke, in which the Joker is a former engineer and failed comedian who leads armed robbers into his former employer, Ace Chemical Processing, Inc., after the death of his pregnant wife. He wears the Red Hood as a disguise and jumps into the chemicals to flee Batman.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean we should believe the Joker, because, well, he\u2019s the Joker. He\u2019s an unreliable narrator, because his insanity keeps him from telling the truth, and us from knowing the difference.\n\nEven Moore\u2019s version of the Joker acknowledged that his story is essentially unknowable.\n\n\"Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another,\" the Joker said. \"If I\u2019m going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!\"\n\nThere are plenty of other variations of the story. Sometimes Batman knocks the Joker into the vat, sometimes the hapless criminal jumps. Sometimes the Red Hood isn\u2019t involved at all. Later storylines show that the Red Hood is an alias adopted by many other criminals. Eventually, even Batman\u2019s sidekick Robin dons the Red Hood.\n\n\"Since that (1951) story was first published, just about every time any comic's made even the most casual reference to Joker's origin, the Red Hood bit has come and gone, but the \u2018fall into a vat of acid, goes nuts\u2019 thing remains,\" Weldon said.\n\nIn the 1989 film version of Batman, Jack Nicholson\u2019s Joker is a lifelong criminal named Jack Napier (the only time the Joker is given a first and last name) who actually is the man who killed Bruce Wayne\u2019s parents. The late Heath Ledger\u2019s acclaimed 2008 take on the Joker in The Dark Knight gives a nod to the ambiguity of it all, with the grease-painted antagonist telling different characters more than one version of how he was disfigured. (There\u2019s also an offshoot movie based on Jared Leto\u2019s tattooed Joker and Harley Quinn from 2016\u2019s Suicide Squad coming, but that\u2019s a different set of issues altogether.)\n\nDC Comics recognizes that their most famous villain juggles the truth. Their Origin of the Joker showed the killer acknowledging that even he gets confused by which story is right.\n\n\n\n \"Though the Red Hood story \u2014 in its blurriest form of spills and chemical burns \u2014 is perhaps the most-pointed to origin story for the Joker, it is by no means the definitive one,\" said Brad Ricca, SAGES Fellow at Case Western Reserve University and a comics historian.\n\nRecent comic book storylines have suggested that Batman has actually matched wits with three different Jokers through the years. Other stories hint further that the Joker may be immortal. The character has cycled through several personalities and backstories, sometimes insane and sometimes not, but always a dark-humored and lethal opponent for Batman. That\u2019s the strength of comic books, which are free to retroactively change the continuity however the creators see fit, our experts said.\n\nWill Brooker, a film and cultural studies professor at Kingston University, said that the most sinister aspect of the character is that inability to define how he became the way he is.\n\n\"My feeling is that to pin Joker down to a fixed backstory and identity is reductive, unimaginative and suggests a lack of understanding of what Joker is really about,\" said Brooker, author of Batman Unmasked: Analyzing a Cultural Icon.\n\n\"He is essentially the opposite of Batman, who has a fixed, definite origin. The whole point is that Batman can never work out who Joker is and where he came from.\"\n\nTapper said the Joker's \"Red Hood\" origin story is \"the true one.\"\n\nThat's right, we're fact-checking where the Joker came from. So sue us!\n\nThis claim is throwing down the gauntlet for comic book nerds, pointing to a 1951 backstory about the Joker wearing a disguise and swimming through chemical waste as the one, true origin of the archvillain. He may prefer that version, and that\u2019s fine, because it\u2019s not wrong. But comic historians and even a DC Comics publicist we consulted agreed that the Joker has no definitive backstory \u2014 indeed, that is one of the defining strengths of the character.", "lang": "en"}
