Liberals have been attacking Judge Roy Moore relentlessly after a fishy story surfaced alleging that he sexually abused a 14-year-old girl decades and decades ago when the now-76 year old man was in his early 30s. Unfortunately, like most of their bombshell stories about people they don't like, this one didn't pass the smell or the reality test. After the publicity began to die down and Harley Hannah, Moore's accuser, began to get tired of lying all the time, she finally admitted the truth during an interview on MSNBC. \"It was like a bad dream,\" she told host Dan Fitzpatrick. \"I don't really remember what happened but my mind filled in the gaps.\"\n\nThere never was any interview on MSNBC and Harley Hannah is not even one of the named women accusing Roy Moore of sexually inappropriate behaviour. The actual named women accusing Moore are:\n\nWe are not sure who the Harley Hannah mentioned in the story is, but we did find a New York conceptual artist by that name. But she was still in college until just a few years ago so she wouldn't have been 14 when Moore was in his late thirties because she probably wasn't even born yet.\n\n\n\nThe image used with the story is also entirely unrelated to the Roy Moore abuse allegations: it shows reality TV star Charlotte Crosby who is crying during an interview about a breakup and a troubled pregnancy.\n\nThe entire article is clearly intended to be satirical in nature since Reagan Was Right carries following disclaimer on all pages:\n\nThe crybaby, ivory tower elitists at Snopes have decided we don't qualify as satire, but we feel the disclaimer still needs to be as plain as the lack of Googling skills in conservative America:\n\n________\n\nsat\u00b7ire ~\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nthe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, OR ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.\n\n________\n\nSorry, Snopes.
