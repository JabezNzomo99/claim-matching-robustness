It has been claimed therein that the RRB has drastically reduced the number of NTPC posts. In this \u2018notice\u2019, it is mentioned, \u201cThis is to inform that indian railways is improving its infrastructure and giving priority to privatisation so hiring process will be through IRCTC. NTPC vacancies 2019 are decreased from 35,277 to 10,648 to decrease the burden on indian railways.\u201d\n\nSeveral Alt News readers sent this image to the official Alt News app for verification.\n\nA cursory look at the image reveals the fact that it is fake. A few indications to this effect are as follows:\n\n1. \u2018Passengers\u2019 has been spelled as \u2018passnegrs\u2019.\n\n2. The words \u2018windows\u2019 and \u2018go to settings to activate windows\u2019 can be seen in the background where the word \u2018Chairpersons\u2019 is mentioned.\n\n3. There is space between the words \u2018recruitment\u2019 and \u2018boards\u2019 at the bottom-right of the page.\n\n4. \u2018Indian railways\u2019 has been written at most places with the small \u2018i\u2019 instead of the capital \u2018I\u2019.\n\nWe then checked the website of the RRB, but found no such notice. The latest notice on the RRB website pertains to the postponement of the exam for recruitment to NTPC posts, which was scheduled to be held between June and September. This notice was issued on October 14. It is worthwhile to note that the fake notice being shared on social media contains October 15 as the date. Had such a dramatic reduction in the number of posts been effected, it would invariably have been covered by the media. However, we found no such report.\n\nAn attempt to create panic and despair among candidates has been made through the spread of this rumour. It may be reiterated that RRB has not reduced the number of NTPC posts from 35,277 to 10,648.", "lang": "en"}
