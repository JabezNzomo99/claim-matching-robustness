No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website set up to mislead Trump supporters and Republicans into sharing made up stories that are clearly marked as satire when you actually click them. Articles from the site are frequently copied by foreign-run fake news websites, including this story. The people liking and sharing these stories are enriching foreign website operators (or a liberal from Maine) via the ad revenue generated with the content which is probably not what they expected or wanted.\n\nThe story originated from an article (archived here) where it was published by Obamawatcher.com on July 29, 2019 under the title \"Federal Court Rules Obama Can Be Charged as a Terrorist\". It opened:\n\nThe 13th Federal Court of Writs and Warrants has cleared the path for Barack Hussein Obama to be tried for treason. According to the unanimous three-judge ruling, if private citizen Barack Obama committed crimes, he can be prosecuted, regardless of his position when he held them. That means no more hiding behind \"Executive Privilege\" or claiming you can't press charges against a President. You're not a President anymore. The court agrees. It will now be up to the Justice Department to see to any charges. According to department spokesman, Art Tubolls: \"Obama can now be charged with treason on 7 counts, including offering foreign aid to the Musselman Brotherhood and sanctioning Islam in the White House. His high crimes and misdemeanors also include saluting with an object in hand, forced servitude of an officer when he made a Marine hold his umbrella, and the wearing of tan after Labor Day before Labor Day.\"\n\nThis particular story was posted under a category named \"Barack Obama Fan Fiction, Hot Potato\", to indicate the story was fiction. And the \"13th Federal Court of Writs and Warrants\" does not exist. The name of the spokesman in the story is a further hint the story is baloney: \"Art Tubolls\" is an anagram for \"Busta Troll\", the owner of the site.\n\nThe site is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run byself-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact checking website Snopes for some time now and has also criticized other fact checkers in the past who labeled his work \"fake news\" instead of satire. In reaction to this he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry extremely visible disclaimers everywhere.\n\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\n\nAbout Satire\n\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\": sat\u00b7ire\n\n\u02c8sa\u02cct\u012b(\u0259)r\n\nnoun\n\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site's pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you're still having an issue with that satire thing.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up. This particular story ended up being lifted by a site named \"usanetwork\" (archived here):\n\nHere is a video of Blair explaining how his process works:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes obamawatcher.com as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
