He argued that it is easy to replace the defensive Aegis missiles with intermediate-range attack missiles, which would be a violation of the treaty.\n\nThe U.S. State Department rejected the accusations, saying Washington has complied with the treaty, and a department spokesperson accused Moscow of \u201cdeflecting attention from Russia's own very clear violations,\u201d which Polygraph.info fact-checked. On December 8, 2017, the State Department said it was seeking Russia\u2019s \u201creturn to compliance.\u201d\n\n\u200bAccording to the INF Treaty, signed in 1987, the United States and Russia are required to eliminate nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges from 300 to 3,400 miles. The treaty resulted in the destruction of some 2,692 intermediate-range nuclear-armed missiles, contributing to international security well after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nMoscow and Washington have accused each other of violating the agreement. According to Russian authorities, Japan\u2019s deployment of the two U.S. systems by 2023 would:\n\n--Go against regional security and stability efforts\n\nOn the first point, according to the U.S. Bureau of Arms Control, the Aegis Ashore system is \u201cfully consistent\u201d with U.S. treaty obligations, as it is \u201conly capable of launching defensive interceptor missiles.\u201d\n\nMoreover, U.S. officials argue that the INF Treaty allows the systems, including Aegis Ashore, which are produced only to intercept \u201cobjects not located on the surface of the earth.\u201d\n\nZack Cooper, senior fellow for Asian security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told Polygraph.info that the system\u2019s current configuration does not violate the INF Treaty, and that Japan chose to deploy it because it is a cheaper option that \u201cfrees up Japanese ships to conduct other missions.\u201d\n\nIn his comments to Polygraph.info, Michael Elleman, senior fellow for missile defense at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) and a contributor to 38 North, a website devoted to analysis of North Korea, explains that Japan requires a layered defense with different systems in order \u201cto optimize the protection of Japan against DPRK missiles.\u201d\n\nSecond, it was Tokyo\u2019s decision, not Washington\u2019s, to deploy the systems. Japan is not a party to the INF Treaty, so the deployment cannot be classified as a violation, Cooper notes.\n\nMoreover, a violation of the INF Treaty would assume that the system in question was not consistent with U.S. treaty obligations, which is not the case given the current configuration of the system.\n\nThird, Japan decided to deploy the systems in response to North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile threat to its national security and that of its allies, thereby bolstering regional security efforts.\n\nNorth Korea has for years conducted numerous missile and nuclear tests that violated UN resolutions. It ramped up such tests significantly in 2017 in its quest for a nuclear deterrent.\n\nAs part of such efforts, Pyongyang test-fired a missile on August 29 over Japan, prompting concerns about Japan\u2019s ability to protect its population. In September 2017, North Korea threatened to use nuclear weapons to \u201csink\u201d Japan and reduce the U.S. to \u201cashes and darkness\u201d after they denounced its nuclear test. And on November 29, it test-fired a Hwasong-15, its most capable missile yet, with the country\u2019s leader Kim Jong Un declaring on January 1 that its nuclear forces are now a reality and the entire U.S. mainland is within its \u201cnuclear strike range.\u201d\n\nFourth, experts say the system does not undermine Russia\u2019s nuclear deterrent given Russia\u2019s large nuclear arsenal and missiles capable of penetrating any missile defense shield.\n\n\u201cAegis Ashore in Japan (or Europe) is not capable of intercepting Russian or Chinese strategic missiles; it is not a threat,\u201d Elleman says.\n\nMoreover, according to Cooper, the shorter ranges of Japanese missiles prevent them from posing \u201ca real challenge\u201d to Russia\u2019s second-strike capabilities critical for strategic stability.\n\nThe Aegis Ashore system might defend Japan against intermediate-range missiles if, say, Russia deployed and used such missiles in a conflict following a collapse of the INF Treaty. But Russia\u2019s \u201ccountermeasures would compromise defense effectiveness,\u201d Cooper notes.\n\nMoscow argues that the seamless and effective operation of U.S. and allied regional missile defense components could undermine Russia\u2019s second-strike capabilities in a conflict with the United States. But that would be contingent on multiple variables and thus unlikely to ensure total protection against the highly capable missiles that Russia has threatened to continue developing.\n\nAlong with inter-continental ballistic missiles, Moscow appears to be relying on nuclear-armed drone submarines for a second-strike capability seen as critical to its security and global stability.", "lang": "en"}
