The leaders were placed under house arrest before the march could commence.\n\nAlt News found the same video posted on Twitter by a handle @WithKashmir_, on April 4, 2018.\n\nIn conclusion, the video of Syed Ali Shah Geelani under house arrest, is of April 2018 and not related to the recent crackdown in the valley.", "lang": "en"}
