Reed, a professor at the School of Environment and Sustainability at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, told Polygraph.info. \u201cEither the words \u2018biosphere sustainability\u2019 are a poor translation or what he is saying is meaningless.\u201d\n\nIvan Blokov, who monitors Russian environmental policies for the watchdog group Greenpeace told Polygraph.info: \u201cI am not familiar with the term biosphere sustainability. Moreover I don\u2019t know how it can be measured in percentage and I do not know what the 10 percent means.\u201d\n\nAs for Russia being an environmental donor, as Putin claims, the Russian ministry report says Russia's \"assimilatory capacity\" exceeds its environmental footprint, making Russia a \"donor of biocapacity to the Earth.\"\n\nBut a check by Polygraph.info shows the figures used in the Russian ministry report appear to be higher than those provided by the Global Footprint Network.\n\nUsing the network's figures, Russia' \"donor\" share of \"biologically productive land\" is around 7 percent. The calculation is derived by measuring Russia's biologically productive land areas compared to its demand on nature known as the ecological footprint.\n\nThe network's Kelly told Polygraph.info: \"As shown in the 2016 WWF Footprint report, using our latest numbers, Russia contains 7.9 percent of the planet\u2019s biocapacity This contrasts to Russia\u2019s Ecological Footprint, which adds up to 6.7 percent of the planet\u2019s biocapacity.\"\n\nStill, without more specifics from Putin, it is unclear how to evaluate his claims.\n\nEnvironmental protection groups say too that Russia is one of the world's major polluters.\n\nA Greenpeace report found that \"Russia's oil giants have been polluting parts of the country's once thriving landscape, often in secret, spilling oil onto the land and into the Arctic Ocean, poisoning the water and destroying the livelihood of local communities and Indigenous Peoples.\"\n\nGreenpeace\u2019s Blokov told Polygraph.info: \u201cIt is difficult to claim whether Russia is contributing to the preservation of the planet\u2019s environment or\u2026to the destruction of its many key elements.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the Russian government is doing very little in solving problems that the Russian Federation creates domestically and for the entire world,\u201d Blokov said of Russia\u2019s environmental policies.\n\nAlexey Yablokov, a professor at the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow and a prominent Russian environmental advisor, told Polygraph.info that the Kremlin is not investing in bettering the environment.\n\n\u201cWe have passed the point of no return and I do not see Russian government willing to preserve what is left of the nation\u2019s vital natural wealth,\u201d he said. \u201cEnvironmental spending had been cut significantly during the last 15 years and now consists only of 0.01 percent of the federal budget.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
