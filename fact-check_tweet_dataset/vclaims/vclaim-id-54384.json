The report stated that Patna Medical College Hospital staffers were seen disposing off an unclaimed body.\n\nWhile the image does not clarify why the body was being disposed off, but it does refer to only one unclaimed body as opposed to multiple dead bodies as mentioned in the viral posts.\n\nWe then checked whether Patna Medical College Hospital treated COVID-19 patients and came across a post on Indian Express dated July 11, 2020, which reported that in Bihar, COVID-19 treatment has been made available only in three medical colleges so far \u2014 NMCH at Patna, ANMCH at Gaya and JLNMCH at Bhagalpur.\n\nHence, the Patna Medical College Hospital is not sanctioned to treat COVID-19 patients. These claims are thus misleading.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
