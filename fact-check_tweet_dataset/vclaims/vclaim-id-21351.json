Let\u2019s try to check the veracity of the claim made in the post \n\n\n\nThe sight of a man in Pakistan Police uniform at -0:25 duration and the men with luggage and backpacks suggesting them to be at some \u2018training camp\u2019 makes the claim fishy.\n\nIn the Facebook post, the user went on to write that, a \u2018tweet\u2019 from a Twitter user even confirmed the same thing he had claimed. When one goes through the comments section of that tweet, a certain user has written that the video was shot at \u2018Kohat Police Center\u2019 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nA search on \u2018Google maps\u2019 confirmed the presence of a Police training centre at Kohat in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the name of the academy was found to be \u2018Police Training College\u2019.\n\nWhen ones goes through the \u2018Photo Gallery\u2019 section in the dashboard of the academy\u2019s website, a photo of the building that resembles the one seen in the video was found.\n\nIn the collage, it can be seen that the colour of the building, the pattern of balcony grills(yellow indicators), and the design of the high walls(red indicators) in both the photos are same.\n\nThough the true purpose of the men seen in the video cannot be ascertained, the above findings lead us to the conclusion that the video was actually shot in the premises of Police Training College at Kohat of Pakistan and not in \u2018Pakistan occupied Kashmir\u2019(PoK) as claimed in the post.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Indian Rivers?", "lang": "en"}
