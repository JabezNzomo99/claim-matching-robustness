Press reports immediately following Obama\u2019s announcement identified the SEALs\u2019 involvement; some explicitly named Team 6.\n\nThen, on May 3, Biden in remarks at an Atlantic Council event lauded the SEALs for their work. He did not mention the specific unit or any specific members by name.\n\n\u201cLet me briefly acknowledge tonight\u2019s distinguished honorees. Admiral Jim Stavridis is the real deal,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe can tell you more about and understands the incredible, the phenomenal, the just almost unbelievable capacity of his Navy SEALs and what they did last Sunday.\u201d\n\nHe later continued: \u201cI\u2019d be remiss also if I didn\u2019t say an extra word about the incredible events, extraordinary events of this past Sunday. As vice president of the United States, as an American, I was in absolute awe, awe, of the capacity and dedication of the entire team \u2014 both the intelligence community, the CIA, the SEALs.\u201d\n\nBiden wasn\u2019t the only one in the administration to publicly confirm the SEALs\u2019 involvement. Then-CIA Director Leon Panetta, in an interview with PBS NewsHour the same day, credited the \u201csplit-second action on the part of the SEALs.\u201d\n\nThere was criticism about the details of the raid emerging from the administration at the time, including by then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates. In particular, as he shared that SEALs were concerned for their safety, Gates said that an agreement to \u201cnot release any operational details\u201d from the mission \u201cfell apart\u201d the day after the raid. But a Defense spokesman later said that statement was not intended \u201cas a criticism of any particular person or office.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was indeed voicing his concern about the breakdown in operational security after the killing of Bin Laden,\u201d Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Geoff Morrell told CNN. \u201cAnonymous sources revealing secret information about the tactics, training, and equipment of covert forces put at risk our ability to successfully mount similar missions in the future.\u201d\n\nThree months after the raid, during a mission to capture or kill a Taliban leader in Afghanistan, Taliban fighters shot down a helicopter carrying 30 U.S. service members, including some members of SEAL Team 6. The episode is often referred to as \u201cExtortion 17,\u201d the call sign for the helicopter transporting the troops.\n\nSome commentators and family members of the victims subsequently criticized the Obama administration for openly crediting the SEALs with the Bin Laden raid. But officials have said that an investigation into the fatal helicopter attack did not support the notion that it was a targeted effort.\n\n\u201cWe do not believe Extortion 17 was the victim of a pre-planned enemy ambush, nor do we believe the enemy had advance knowledge of our flight route and landing zone location,\u201d Garry Reid, who was principal deputy assistant secretary of Defense for special operations and low intensity conflict, told Congress in 2014.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
