A strong proponent of states\u2019 rights, he was also critical of the Constitution\u2019s opening line of \u201cWe the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho authorized them to speak the language of, \u2018We, the people,\u2019 instead of, \u2018We, the states?\u2019 States are the characteristics and the soul of a confederation,\u201d Henry said during the Virginia Ratifying Convention in 1788.\n\nAlthough he believed in a limited federal government, the quote in question does not appear in the transcripts of Henry\u2019s speeches, which are made available by the Patrick Henry Memorial Foundation, and neither can it be found anywhere else credible online.\n\nThomas S. Kidd, a distinguished professor of history at Baylor University who has written about Henry, researched the origin of the quote, writing in a 2012 piece for HuffPost that it \u201cseems to have been entirely fabricated.\u201d He believes the quote first appeared in 2003 in the text of two books. Google Books shows references dating back to at least the 1990s.\n\nThe meme appears to be pulled from Constituting America, a group that seeks to educate students and adults about the Constitution. The organization shared the same meme on Facebook in December 2013, receiving nearly 62,000 shares.", "lang": "en"}
