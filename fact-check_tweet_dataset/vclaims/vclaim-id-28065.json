The caption accompanying the image suggests that the lawmakers are members of Congress.\n\n\u201cThese are the folks that couldn\u2019t get the budget out by Oct. 1, and are about to control your health care, cap and trade, and the list goes on and on,\u201d reads the caption. \u201cShould we buy them larger screen computers \u2013 or \u2013 a ticket home, permanently? This is one of their 3-DAY WORK WEEKS that we all pay for (salary is about $179,000 per year).\u201d\n\nThe image does not, however, depict members of Congress using their computers for entertainment while in session. Taken by photographer Jessica Hill for The Associated Press, it actually shows Connecticut state legislators, according to its caption.\n\n\u201cHouse Minority Leader Lawrence F. Cafero Jr., R-Norwalk, far right, speaks while colleagues play solitaire on their computers as the House convenes to vote on a new budget for the fiscal year in the Capitol, in Hartford, Conn., Monday, Aug., 31, 2009,\u201d reads the caption.\n\nDemocratic state Rep. Jack Hennessy, one of the two lawmakers caught playing solitaire, publicly apologized after the photo started circulating, calling it \u201cpoor judgement.\u201d (RELATED: Have Congressional Salaries Gone Up 231% In The Past 30 Years?)\n\nThe post\u2019s claim that the pictured lawmakers make $179,000 per year doesn\u2019t hold up either. Non-ranking members of Congress currently make $174,000 per year, according to a Congressional Research Service report. Meanwhile, base pay for rank-and-file Connecticut legislators is $28,000, according to a 2015 government report.\n\nThe photograph has been falsely attributed to Congress and various state legislatures since 2009, according to Snopes.", "lang": "en"}
