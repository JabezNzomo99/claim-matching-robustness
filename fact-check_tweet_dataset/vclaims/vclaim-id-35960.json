The list included Sanchez, who has been serving jail time for 25 years for the Eileen Sarmenta-Allan Gomez case and for the double murder of Nelson and Rickson Pe\u00f1alosa.\n\nUnder the law, those authorized to grant time allowances are the director of BuCor, the chief of the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, and/or the warden of a provincial, district, municipal or city jail. (READ: Early release of Antonio Sanchez? Here's what the GCTA law says)\n\nThe news that Sanchez might soon go free enraged Filipinos. The backlash prompted the DOJ to backtrack on August 22, the same day Maravillas\u2019 video was released. BuCor Director General Nicanor Faeldon said that Sanchez may not be qualified after all, because of reports that he committed violations in jail.\n\nAre the likes of Antonio Sanchez eligible for reduced sentence? The ambiguous provisions of the GCTA law should either be interpreted by the Supreme Court or amended by Congress.

But he said later that it would be best if the Supreme Court or Congress clarified this once and for all.", "lang": "en"}
