The girl seen in the photos was made district superintendent of police (DSP) just for a day in Maharashtra's Buldhana district ahead of International Women's Day.\n\nMany Facebook users have shared the misleading post. The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nWith the help of reverse search, we found a YouTube video of \"The Times of India\" regarding the incident. As per this news report, 14-year-old Sahrish Kanwal of the Zilla Parishad Urdu High School in Malkapur tehsil took over as DSP for a day in Maharashtra's Buldhana district.\n\nThe district administration had taken the initiative just before International Women's Day to motivate girls and allow them to experience how officials function and also address other issues.\n\nThe week-long initiative was conceptualised by Buldhana collector Suman Chandra and the administration is also celebrating 'Pink Week', focusing on women's health.\n\nThe Times of India had published a detailed report on the same on March 5.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that the girl seen in the viral photos has not cracked the IAS exam but took over as DSP for a day.", "lang": "en"}
