That\u2019s an old distortion of the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s analyses, which found some workers would choose to work fewer hours or retire earlier mainly due to the insurance-expansion provisions of the law.\n\u2022 Trump uses outdated Census data to falsely claim that household income is \u201c$4,000 less today\u201d than it was 16 years ago.\n\u2022 Trump touted an increase in those who are \u201coutside of the labor force\u201d of nearly 14 million people under President Obama. That figure includes retirees \u2014 such as the baby boom generation \u2014 teenagers and stay-at-home parents.\n\u2022 Trump also said that \u201c58 percent of African-American youth are either outside of the labor force or not employed.\u201d That factors in those age 16 to 24 who are not looking for work, which would include many in school.\n\nIn his speech, Trump combined two misheard quotes to wrongly claim that Clinton wants to raise taxes on the middle class. But as the Tax Policy Center has concluded, under Clinton\u2019s plan, \u201cthe bottom 95 percent of taxpayers would see little or no change in their taxes.\u201d\n\nThere are actually two Clinton quotes taken out of context in this Trump statement.\n\nThe \u201cshort-circuited\u201d comment came during a conference of black and Hispanic journalists on Aug. 5. Clinton was asked to explain her claim in a \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d interview that FBI Director James Comey found her public statements about not sending or receiving classified email on her private server to be \u201ctruthful.\u201d (It\u2019s a claim we looked at and concluded was false.) Clinton said that she and \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Chris Wallace \u201cwere probably talking past each other\u201d and, she said, \u201cI may have short circuited it\u201d \u2014 meaning her answer to Wallace.\n\nAlthough that context is clear, Trump had some campaign fun with the remark, claiming that Clinton said she herself \u201cshort-circuited.\u201d\n\nThe second Clinton quote taken out of context came during a speech Clinton gave recently in Omaha, Nebraska. Trump claims that Clinton said, \u201cWe are going to raise taxes on the middle class.\u201d The Clinton campaign says that she said, \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to raise taxes on the middle class.\u201d\n\nOur fact-checking colleagues at PolitiFact reached out to a linguistics professor at the University of Chicago who ran the audio through a computer program that analyzes phonetics. PolitiFact concluded that Clinton said \u201caren\u2019t,\u201d \u201cbecause she definitely pronounced the \u2018n,\u2019 though she didn\u2019t really hit the \u2018t.\u2019\u201d\n\nRegardless of whether or not one hears the \u201ct,\u201d the context of Clinton\u2019s speech and her consistent claims on the campaign trail make clear that Clinton meant to say that she didn\u2019t intend to raise taxes on middle-income earners. More important, as we have written before, the Clinton tax plan would not raise taxes on middle-income earners.\n\nAccording to a Tax Policy Center analysis of Clinton\u2019s tax plans to date, \u201cNearly all of the tax increases would fall on the top 1 percent; the bottom 95 percent of taxpayers would see little or no change in their taxes.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton campaign website claims she would give \u201cworking families \u2026 tax relief that helps them manage rising costs.\u201d The Clinton campaign points to several tax cuts that Clinton supports, such as a tax credit for out-of-pocket health care costs, tax relief for families caring for ailing parents or grandparents, and an extension of a tax credit for college tuition. But those are all targeted tax relief measures, not across-the-board tax cuts for middle-income families.\n\nThe Clinton campaign told us \u201cthere will be more\u201d middle-income tax cuts, but has not revealed any further details.\n\nTrump said Clinton\u2019s plan \u201cwould tax many small businesses by almost 50 percent.\u201d That\u2019s a reference not specifically to \u201csmall businesses\u201d but to households earning more than $5 million a year. Such households already pay a marginal income tax rate of up to 43.4 percent; Clinton proposes an additional 4 percent tax on income above that threshold.\n\nThat would apply to a small fraction of \u201csmall businesses.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, Trump isn\u2019t talking about corporate taxes. Instead, he\u2019s talking about individual income taxes. Business owners who are part of partnerships, LLCs and sole proprietorships pay taxes on profits through their individual tax returns \u2014 what\u2019s called pass-through taxes. Anyone who invests in such businesses \u2014 not necessarily runs or operates them \u2014 and therefore gets disbursements from profits, pays these pass-through taxes on their individual returns.\n\nA footnote to Trump\u2019s speech explains how Trump arrived at the \u201cnearly 50 percent\u201d tax. It says: \u201cthe Sum of a Statutory Rate of 39.6%, a Medicare Wage and Salary Surcharge of 0.9%, a Medicare Investment Income Surcharge of 3.8%, and an Income Surcharge over $5 million of 4.0%.\u201d That adds up to 48.3 percent.\n\nTax experts told us that figure is a little too high because, as Alan Cole, an economist at the Tax Foundation explained to us, the 0.9 percent Medicare surcharge is mutually exclusive with the 3.8 percent net investment income tax. So, he said, adding all those together would never get to more than 47.4 percent.\n\nAnd all but 4 percent is in existing tax policy.\n\nThe top statutory rate is currently 39.6 percent. It was first set at that rate under President Bill Clinton, Cole said, but was then temporarily lowered to 35 percent as part of President George W. Bush\u2019s 2001 tax cuts. However, President Obama and Congress allowed the lower rate to expire under the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.\n\nThe 3.8 percent net investment income tax was implemented as part of the Affordable Care Act. So was the 0.9 percent additional Medicare wages tax.\n\nThe only new tax that is proposed by Clinton is her plan for a 4 percent tax on income over $5 million (or $2.5 million for married couples filing separately).\n\n\u201cThat is based on adjusted gross income (AGI), so it would apply to pass-through business income reported on individual returns,\u201d said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center.\n\nAnd, Rosenberg said, it would only apply to a small fraction of business owners with very high incomes.\n\nHow many exactly?\n\nRosenberg told us there is no perfect answer, but based on the most recent year of IRS data:\n\u2022 About 34,000 returns had AGI above $5 million.\n\u2022 About 9,000 returns with AGI over $5 million reported either a net profit or loss on Schedule C (out of the 23.5 million returns overall).\n\u2022 About 30,000 returns with AGI over $5 million reported either a net profit or loss from a partnership or S corporation, which is less than 0.4 percent of the 8.5 million returns overall.\n\nCole explained: \u201cThere are about 34,000 tax filers above Hillary Clinton\u2019s $5 million threshold. Since a lot of such high-income taxpayers have income from one or more pass through businesses, there are probably quite a few businesses that would be affected in some way. But there would also be millions that wouldn\u2019t be.\u201d\n\nSo, the current top possible rate on individual income (and therefore, pass-through business income) is 43.4 percent, which would increase to 47.4 percent under Hillary Clinton\u2019s proposals, which would apply to only multimillionaires.\n\nVowing to repeal the estate tax, Trump said that \u201cAmerican workers have paid taxes their whole lives, and they should not be taxed again at death.\u201d Very few estates \u2014 roughly one out of 500 \u2014 were subject to the federal estate tax in 2014.\n\nIn 2015, the first $5.43 million is exempt from the estate tax (and it\u2019s double that for couples). The value of an estate over that is taxed at a rate of 40 percent. As a result of that threshold \u2014 much higher than in decades past \u2014 very few actually pay any federal estate tax. In 2014, for example, among the nearly 2.6 million deaths, fewer than 5,000 people had to pay any estate tax, according to the IRS.\n\nAs for Trump\u2019s claim that families are \u201ctaxed again at death\u201d \u2014 which echoes a frequent criticism that estates are subject to double taxation \u2014 as we have written in the past, that\u2019s only the case for cash that had been taxed when it was earned as income. Investments, such as stocks, bonds and real estate, would not have been taxed before, if they had not been sold prior to the owner\u2019s death.\n\nAn Old Distortion of CBO\u2019s Analysis\n\nTrump resurrected an old GOP talking point in claiming he\u2019d save \u201c2 million American jobs\u201d by repealing the Affordable Care Act. Trump is twisting the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s analyses of the law. The CBO has estimated a decline in the amount of labor workers choose to supply \u2014 not a reduction in the number of jobs \u2014 in response to mainly the insurance-expansion provisions of the ACA.\n\nThe Trump campaign\u2019s prepared remarks cite a December 2015 report by the nonpartisan CBO, which describes workers deciding to work fewer hours or retire earlier than they otherwise would mainly in response to the law\u2019s income-based subsidies and other coverage-expanding provisions. The report says it all amounts to a reduction in the supply of labor equal to 2 million full-time equivalent workers in 2025. It\u2019s not a loss of 2 million jobs.\n\nRepublicans have been distorting this finding from the CBO for years. We wrote about the talking point in 2014, when several members of Congress inaccurately claimed a CBO report was on \u201clost jobs\u201d due to the ACA. In fact, that report, like the updated estimate released in December, said the health care law would cause a reduction in \u201cthe amount of labor that workers choose to supply.\u201d\n\nA day after the 2014 report was released, then-CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf explained in a congressional budget hearing why claims about \u201clost jobs\u201d would be wrong. \u201cThe reason that we don\u2019t use the term \u2018lost jobs\u2019 is there\u2019s a critical difference between people who would like to work and can\u2019t find a job or have a job that is lost for reasons beyond their control and people who choose not to work,\u201d Elmendorf said on Feb. 5, 2014.\n\nBack in 2011, in a GOP presidential debate, Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota was twisting an earlier CBO report on this topic.\n\nThe 2015 CBO report goes into detail on how CBO calculated its estimates and how the law would impact the amount of labor that some workers would choose to supply. For instance, those who receive premium assistance subsidies (available to those earning between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level) would get less in subsidies if their income rises above certain levels, since the subsidies are phased out based on income. That would create a disincentive to work more hours for some of those workers, who essentially wouldn\u2019t get enough of a benefit from the additional work to make up for the loss in subsidies.\n\nSome in that situation may also realize they don\u2019t have to work more in order to pay for health care. \u201cThe exchange subsidies also boost recipients\u2019 effective income, on average, by reducing their out-of-pocket spending on health care or health insurance,\u201d CBO explains. This would then \u201creduce the amount of labor that recipients supply.\u201d\n\nCBO also explains how insurance-regulation provisions that prohibit the denial of coverage to those with preexisting conditions and limit premium pricing based on age \u201clower the cost of insurance plans available to many older people outside the workplace. As a result, some will choose to retire earlier than they would have otherwise, CBO expects.\u201d\n\nA Medicare payroll surtax in the law \u2014 of 0.9 percentage points for those earning more than $200,000 (or $250,000 for couples) a year \u2014 will also reduce the supply of labor, CBO says.\n\nThe CBO noted that these estimates are uncertain for various reasons, one of which is that the analysis relies on estimates of how people may react to work incentives.\n\nConversely, in a June 2015 report on the impact of repealing the ACA, the CBO estimated that repeal would \u201cincrease the aggregate number of hours worked by about 1.5 percent over the 2021\u20132025 period.\u201d\n\nTrump falsely claimed that household income is \u201c$4,000 less today\u201d than it was 16 years ago. That was the case in 2014, but not today.\n\nThe Trump campaign points to annual Census data for real median household income, which is adjusted for inflation, to support his claim. But that Census data \u2014 which is derived from the American Community Survey \u2014 is current only through 2014.\n\nReal median household income was $53,657 in 2014 \u2014 down from $57,724 in 2000. That\u2019s how Trump arrives at his \u201cmore than $4,000\u2033 figure.\n\nHowever, as we have written before, Sentier Research provides more current household income estimates based on the monthly Current Population Survey, a different statistical series from the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Sentier\u2019s most recent report places the median household income at $57,206 as of June \u2014 slightly below the $57,826 it was in January 2000, which is when this statistical series started. That\u2019s a difference of just $620 \u2014 not more than $4,000.\n\nThe Sentier Research estimate reflects economic changes since 2014. As we have also written before, paychecks are rising faster than inflation \u2014 especially in the last two years. The most recent figure on average weekly earnings for all workers in June was 3.1 percent above the figure for the same month in 2014.\n\nTrump\u2019s use of the 2014 Census data is outdated and inaccurate.\n\nTrump said that the number of people \u201coutside of the labor force\u201d is up by 14 million under President Obama. However, that figure includes millions of retirees and students who do not want to work.\n\nTrump\u2019s figures are correct based on the most recent seasonally adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Those who are not in the labor force are not working and not looking for work. And most of those people have no desire to work.\n\nBLS provides a breakdown of the 92.9 million people outside the labor force as of July 2016 (that\u2019s the nonseasonally adjusted figure). It includes almost 39 million retirement-age Americans 65 and older. It also includes 9.5 million teenagers \u2014 age 16 to 19 \u2014 many of whom aren\u2019t looking for jobs. It includes 5.8 million 20- to 24-year-olds, some of whom are in college. Millions of stay-at-home parents are also among those not in the labor force, as well as early retirees and anyone else who doesn\u2019t need or want to work.\n\nOf all those not in the labor force, just over 6.2 million want a job, according to BLS data. When Obama took office in January 2009, the figure was 5.9 million.\n\nAs we have written before, the change in the labor force is mostly due to demographic factors, such as the retirement of post-World War II baby boomers.\n\nTrump also said that \u201c58 percent of African-American youth are either outside of the labor force or not employed.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign cited annual average data for 2015 from the BLS. That year, 583,000 African Americans age 16 to 24 were unemployed. That was roughly 9.9 percent of the total civilian noninstitutional population for African Americans in that age group.\n\nTo get to 58 percent, the Trump campaign also counted the nearly 2.88 million African Americans 16- to 24-years-old \u2014 many of whom are in school \u2014 who were not in the labor force, which, as we mentioned, means that they are not working and not looking for work.\n\nAs of July 2016, 22.5 percent of the labor force for African Americans in that age group \u2014 who were not enrolled in high school or college \u2014 were unemployed, according to the most recent nonseasonally adjusted data from the BLS.\n\nCorrection, Aug. 9: We originally wrote that the unemployment rate for African Americans age 16 to 24 averaged 10 percent for 2015. That\u2019s the percentage of the civilian noninstitutional population for African Americans in that age group that were unemployed.", "lang": "en"}
