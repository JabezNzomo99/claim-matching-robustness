It can be used when someone is being prosecuted for an offence that carries a custodial sentence of at least one year, or has been sentenced to imprisonment or detention for at least four months.\n\nIn some cases the EAW does not apply if a suspect is in a country which doesn\u2019t recognise the crime they are charged with.\n\nIn 2014 the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency issued 228 EAWs for suspects in other EU countries, and 228 again in 2015. In return it received 13,500 EAWs in 2014 and 12,600 in 2015.\n\nThe EAW doesn\u2019t apply to non-EU member countries. However, other non-EU member states, such as Norway have negotiated similar arrangements (although they\u2019re not yet in force).\n\nWe changed the word \"deport\" to \"remove\" in our conclusion, to make clear that the process under a European Arrest Warrant is separate to that of deportation.", "lang": "en"}
