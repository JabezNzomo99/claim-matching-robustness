President Donald Trump has blamed antifa, short for anti-fascist, activists for some of the looting and rioting that has occurred alongside such protests, according to The Associated Press.\n\nIn the video, a law enforcement officer brandishing a gun with other officers behind him allegedly delivers the message to the groups, saying, \u201cYoung man, I\u2019ll meet you on solid ground anytime, anywhere, light or heavy, makes no difference to me. You won\u2019t walk away.\u201d\n\nHowever, the video actually shows Clay Higgins, then a captain with the St. Landry Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office, sending a message to suspected local gang members in February 2016. Neither antifa nor Black Lives Matter is mentioned in Higgins\u2019 address, which was posted on YouTube in its entirety by ABC affiliate KATC.\n\nThe video being shared leaves out the introduction of the speech where Higgins says the names of wanted gang members and displays the suspects\u2019 photos, the full video shows.

He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in December of that year and won reelection in 2018, according to The New York Times.", "lang": "en"}
