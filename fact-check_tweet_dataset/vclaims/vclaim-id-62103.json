The quote first appeared in a headline from a website that calls its work satire.\n\nA longtime purveyor of made-up news is behind a headline shared on Facebook claiming that former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s wife, Jill Biden, has said that \u201cAll Americans Will Be Required to Learn Spanish When We Win.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that the former second lady has ever said that.\n\nThe website tatersgonnatate.com published its story on Aug. 20, claiming in the text that Jill Biden\u2019s \u201conly initiative as First Lady will be to require all Americans to learn Spanish.\u201d\n\nThe website belongs to America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, a publisher that deems its work satire and has concocted many stories over the years, with the purported mission of duping conservatives. Many of its claims generate confusion or are spread online without the disclaimers that exist on the originating websites.\n\nIn this case, the same fabricated quote from the headline also appeared in a popular Aug. 26 Facebook post, erroneously attributing the information to \u201cNew York Post.\u201d\n\nWe could find no New York Post article actually reporting on the supposed quote. Instead, we came across other fact-checks that made note of dubious websites that also reportedly spread the claim.\n\nEven the link to the original story \u2014 which includes disclaimers that make clear the story is fake, for those who click through and read \u2014 has evidently tricked some Facebook users.\n\nFor example, the story was shared in a Facebook group honoring Fox News host Tucker Carlson, where many commenters derided the false story as if it were real. One claimed the supposed proposal was part of the Bidens\u2019 \u201csocialist demands,\u201d and another said it was an \u201ceffort to sway Hispanic votes.\u201d\n\nJill Biden, who holds a doctorate in education, has taught English at a community college and recently told CBS News that she plans to continue teaching if her husband is elected president.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
