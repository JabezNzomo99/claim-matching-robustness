Ilhan Omar checking an automatic rifle while wearing a military uniform.\n\nThe photo shows a female Somali Army recruit in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia. It was taken four years before Omar was born.\n\nSocial media users frequently post images that falsely claim to depict politicians, often in attempts to show them in a negative light. This image is one of those cases, allegedly showing Omar checking an automatic rifle at an extremist group training camp.

She was elected to Congress in 2018.\n\nHowever, the woman featured in the picture shared on Facebook is not, in fact, Omar. The original image, which the Daily Caller found through a reverse image search, actually shows a female Somali Army recruit at a training camp in Mogadishu, according to the caption.\n\nIt was taken in February 1978, so it is impossible for the woman in the photograph to be Omar, as she was born in 1982.", "lang": "en"}
