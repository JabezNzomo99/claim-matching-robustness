He interacted with the workers and also arranged for their travel, a move most politicians from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) dubbed as a photo-op.\n\nNow, several images are being shared on social media with a claim that Gandhi\u2019s meeting with the migrants was staged as the labourers who can be seen interacting with the former Congress president are actually members of the Congress party.\n\nHowever, the claim is false and misleading.
