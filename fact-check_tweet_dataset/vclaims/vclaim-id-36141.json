Ilhan Omar, who wasn\u2019t born until 1982.\n\n\n\nA 41-year-old photo of a woman with a gun in Somalia is being used to spread misinformation about Rep. Ilhan Omar, a 36-year-old Democrat from Minnesota.\n\nOmar, whose family fled civil war in Somalia and came to the U.S. when she was a child in the 1990s, became one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress in 2018. Since then, she has become a frequent target of false online attacks, has had her commitment to the U.S. Constitution questioned, and has been accused by President Donald Trump of harboring sympathy for terrorists.\n\nNow, she\u2019s been falsely identified as a participant in an \u201cAl-Qaeda terrorist training camp\u201d based on a photo of someone else. There are several versions of this false claim circulating on social media, but the photo in question is actually from 1978. Omar was not born until four years later on Oct. 4, 1982.\n\nThe Associated Press photo shows an unidentified female recruit for the Somali army during a Cold-War fueled dispute between Somalia and Ethiopia over territory in the Ogaden region between the two countries. So, the claim that it shows an \u201cAl-Qaeda terrorist training camp\u201d is also false. Al Qaeda wasn\u2019t founded until 1988, a decade after the photo was taken, and the group didn\u2019t expand into Somalia until even later.\n\nThis mislabeled photo is just another bogus attempt to tie Omar to terrorism.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
