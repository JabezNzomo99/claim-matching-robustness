Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Dainik Jagran\u2019s article on Hardik Patel stating the plan to discredit Modi by spreading violence in the country, and Kejriwal\u2019s support to fund this through the Ford Foundation Fact: Hardik Patel hasn\u2019t made any such statement. The \u2018Dainik Jagran\u2019 epaper clip from 2013 is morphed and edited with a different title. The original title mentions about 150 Mulsim families accepting the Hindu religion. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched on the internet about the news mentioned in the post, it is found that this image of Dainik Jargarn\u2019s article was in circulation since 2015 and was found as a text post on 5 November 2015.\n\nWhen we observe the headline carefully, one can notice that it is not in proper alignment with the borders and looks to be edited. When searched if Hardik Patel ever made such a statement about spreading violence in the country to discredit Modi, no relevant results were found. Also, the content in the article talks about the religious conversion of 150 Muslim families in the presence of Badrinath Dham\u2019s Shankaracharya. Hence the image looks to be an edited one.\n\nThe image shared also has an epaper URL of Dainik Jagaran\u2019s article, which is currently not available. But when searched with relevant keywords from the content and by applying time filter, search results with the same URL and content, but with a different headline were found. The image found on \u2018World Hindu News\u2019 has the headline \u2018150 \u092e\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0932\u093f\u092e \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0930 \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0942 \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0936\u093e\u092e\u093f\u0932\u2019. On further search, the original story published by Dainik Jagaran was also found.\n\nBased on the above findings, it is clear that the headline of an article published by Dainik Jagran on 24 December 2013, about conversion of 150 Muslim families into Hindu religion, is edited to claim that Hardik Patel accepting his plan to discredit Modi by spreading violence in the country, and Kejriwal\u2019s support to fund this through the Ford Foundation.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
