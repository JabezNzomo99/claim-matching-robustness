Let\u2019s try to check the authenticity of the image posted.\n\nClaim: Modi, wearing a Muslim skull cap, was seen sitting beside Imran Khan on the dining table. \n\n\n\nFact: The image has been photoshopped. In the original picture, Imran Khan\u2019s wife can be seen sitting beside him. Also, a Muslim skull cap has been placed over the picture of Modi. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the image posted on Facebook is cropped (keeping only Imran Khan) and ran through Yandex Reverse Image search, the original picture can be found in the search results. In the original picture, beside Imran Khan, his wife Reham Khan can be found. In the edited photo, Modi\u2019s picture has been placed in her place to misguide people.\n\nWhen the Modi\u2019s portion in the edited photo is cropped and ran through Yandex Reverse Image search, the original photo from where the Modi\u2019s portion was taken can be found in the search results. The original picture of Modi was taken in 2015 while having lunch in the Parliament canteen. In the picture, it can be found that Modi was not wearing any skull cap. So, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nFinally, Modi was not having lunch with Imran Khan. It\u2019s a photoshopped image.", "lang": "en"}
