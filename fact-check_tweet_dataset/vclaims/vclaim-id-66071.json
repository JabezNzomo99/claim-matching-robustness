If you clean, come on clean, you know?\" he said to colleague Chris Wallace on July 14. \"My grandmother used to say ... \u2018Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.\u2019 The deception, Chris, is mind-boggling.\"\n\nNow here\u2019s where things get really weird.\n\nSeveral days after Smith\u2019s on-air editorializing went viral, a website called America\u2019s Last Line of Defense posted a story claiming Smith had been fired by Fox News for criticizing Trump.\n\nThe story then takes a wild turn, claiming Smith reacted to his firing like a violent madman in the throes of a Godzilla-like meltdown during which Smith threw things across the Fox studio, kicked barrells and punched Fox News host Sean Hannity in the nose, drawing blood.\n\nThere are two major problems with this story, however.\n\nFirst, as the screengrab below shows, the day after Smith\u2019s supposed firing and meltdown, his hourlong Fox News show Shepard Smith Reporting aired according to its regularly scheduled time.\n\nSecond, and most importantly, America\u2019s Last Line of Defense admits it\u2019s a satirical site with a stated mission is to draw readers, especially conservatives, into mistaking its extraordinary conspiracies for truth.\n\n\"While everything on this site is a satirical work of fiction, we are proud to present it to those who will have called it real anyway,\" reads the disclaimer.\n\nAt least one website, American News -- which does not explicitly state its satirical intent (if it has one) -- appears to have taken the bait.\n\nAs the previous work of our friends at Snopes makes clear, this is not the first time Smith has been the center of a hoax claiming he was fired from Fox News for being too controversial.\n\nWe rate this Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
