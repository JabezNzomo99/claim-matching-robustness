They want $12 billion more. It\u2019s $54.4 billion, which is by itself a lot, but in foreign aid they want $12 billion over the $54 billion. Think of it. We give $54 billion, a lot of it because they want to give it. They don\u2019t even know who they\u2019re giving it to. In many cases, people don\u2019t ever \u2014 don\u2019t even know the name of the country. They know nothing about the country, and yet \u2014 so they\u2019re going to give 54.4 billion in foreign aid but they want 12 billion more than that in foreign aid but they won\u2019t approve $5.6 billion for a wall that\u2019s going to pay for itself almost on a monthly basis.\n\nThe House bill, which passed largely along party lines, does not seek $12 billion more than current spending levels. It seeks $54.4 billion, a little less than 1 percent more than the current spending level.\n\nIt\u2019s also the same amount approved by Republican-led congressional appropriations committees last summer.\n\nAnd, finally, it is wrong to call the entire $54 billion \u201cforeign aid.\u201d About $16 billion of that amount is for State Department operations.\n\nWith its new majority in the House, Democrats passed a bill Jan. 3 to fund various parts of the government through Sept. 30. It passed 241-190, with every Democrat and seven Republicans supporting it. That plan includes a little over $54.4 billion in \u201cDepartment of State, foreign operations and related programs\u201d funding.\n\nThe bill did not include the $5.6 billion in additional funding for border wall construction the president seeks, despite Trump\u2019s vow that he would veto a spending bill without that wall funding. Due to the president\u2019s veto threat, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would not bring up the bill in the Senate. The government is in a partial shutdown pending resolution of the issue.\n\nA day after the bill passed, the RNC tweeted an image of Pelosi and text that said, \u201cThis is immoral: Instead of addressing the border crisis here at home, the Pelosi plan would spend $54 billion taxpayer money on foreign countries.\u201d\n\nThe RNC tweeted the same image on Jan. 7, along with the additional comment that the $54 billion was \u201c$12 billion over President Trump\u2019s request.\u201d\n\nA review of the legislative history of funding for the State Department and foreign operations shows why it is misleading, however, to link that $54 billion amount solely to the Democrats.\n\nIn February of 2018, the Trump administration released a fiscal year 2019 budget that would have reduced funding for the \u201cDepartment of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs\u201d to about $42 billion, according to a Congressional Research Service analysis. That was a proposed cut of about $12 billion from fiscal 2018.\n\nBut the Republican-controlled House and Senate appropriations committees balked.\n\nOn June 30, the House Appropriations Committee signed off on about $54.2 billion. The vote in the committee was 30-21, with every Republicans on the committee and one Democrat supporting it.\n\nAlthough the White House budget had called for slashing the State Department spending bill by about 22 percent, Republican Reps. Rodney Frelinghuysen, who chaired the committee, and Hal Rogers, who chaired the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee, justified the higher amount as necessary to the keep America secure.\n\nFrelinghuysen, June 20: This bill provides funding to ensure that America remains secure and that our diplomats and allies around the world have the tools they need to increase stability during this volatile time of international threats and unease. It will help advance peaceful and effective solutions to the many rising challenges facing the nation and the globe \u2013 including terrorism, threats from nuclear and chemical weapons, and emergency response efforts. Rogers, June 20: In the face of unprecedented challenges around the globe from terrorism and violent extremism, transnational crime and drugs, and humanitarian crises, I am proud that this legislation continues to strengthen our diplomatic and development tools \u2013 core components of our nation\u2019s security framework \u2026 In particular, this bill prioritizes funding for embassy security, combatting drug trafficking, global health and humanitarian assistance, and countering Russian aggression while maintaining vigilant oversight of every dollar spent.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Nita Lowey, who was ranking Democrat on committee at the time, said the GOP budget bill avoided the White House\u2019s \u201cirresponsible FY 2019 proposal to cut our diplomatic and development efforts.\u201d Still, she opposed the bill, arguing that it should have invested more in the country\u2019s overseas efforts.\n\nThe Senate Appropriations Committee unanimously passed a bill the following day to provide $54.4 billion for the State Department, foreign operations and related programs.\n\nRepublican Sens. Richard Shelby, chairman of the appropriations committee, and Lindsey Graham, chairman of the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, praised the funding bill, which was never voted on by the full Senate.\n\nShelby, June 21: This bill works to ensure that our foreign assistance funding is both effective and efficient. Additionally, it provides the appropriate resources for programs impacting global health. Whether for humanitarian, diplomatic, or national security purposes, foreign aid programs can play a role in preserving the security of the United States. Graham, June 21: First and foremost, this is a national security bill. This bill makes America safer by supporting critical diplomatic efforts around the world, providing security assistance for our allies, directing stabilization assistance for areas in chaos due to conflict, and supporting life-saving health and humanitarian assistance to people in dire need. The challenges we face are increasingly dynamic and complex, with hostile regimes seeking to undermine our standing on the world\u2019s stage at every turn. Now is not the time for retreat. This bill signals to the world that America is not backing away from its role as the leader of the free world.\u201d\n\nWhether that spending level is \u201cimmoral,\u201d as the GOP tweet put it, is a matter of opinion. But it is misleading to cite that figure as \u201cThe Pelosi\u2019s Plan.\u201d The $54 billion included in the House bill was \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to the amount in the bill that passed unanimously out of the Senate appropriations committee in June, Mike Burns, a spokesman for Lowey, told us.\n\nThe president was also wrong to suggest the Democratic bill sought an additional $12 billion over the current spending level of about $54 billion.\n\nAs we said, the Democratic-sponsored House bill mirrored the $54.4 billion in the Senate appropriations bill that was about 1 percent higher than current funding. Rather, $12 billion is the amount Trump sought to slash from current funding levels, as the RNC\u2019s Jan. 7 tweet accurately stated. But neither Democrats nor Republicans in the House and Senate appropriations committees supported that cut.\n\nTrump was also wrong to characterize the entire amount as \u201cforeign aid.\u201d According to staffers in Lowey\u2019s office, about half of that $54 billion goes to USAID for international development and humanitarian efforts and other State Department assistance such as global health, economic support and development assistance \u2014 all of which could certainly be described as foreign aid. But it also includes about $16 billion for State Department operations and embassy security, according to a breakdown of funding in the bill passed by the Senate Appropriations Committee provided by Lowey\u2019s office.\n\nFinally, Trump repeated the dubious claim that \u201c$5.6 billion for a wall\u201d would \u201cpay for itself almost on a monthly basis.\u201d As we have written, Trump claimed that the wall \u201cprobably would pay for itself in a month or two because we lose pretty close to $250 billion on illegal immigration\u201d \u2014 but there is no support for that cost estimate.", "lang": "en"}
