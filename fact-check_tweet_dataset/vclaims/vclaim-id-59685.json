But medical experts and government guidelines indicate that the risks in the flyer are misleading, though the rights stated are broadly accurate.\n\nA \u201cregional authority has mandated all persons entering indoor facilities wear a mask,\u201d says this July 19, 2020 post from a Facebook user in Canada, which features the image of the flyer and does not specify which regional authority it is referring to.\n\nThe flyer also appears on Facebook here.\n\nAFP Fact Check breaks down the claims in the flyer below.\n\nThe false claims that a mask will decrease oxygen intake and cause the wearer to inhale toxins have been made in multiple social media posts, including those fact-checked by AFP here, here, here and here.\n\nVinita Dubey, Associate Medical Officer of Health at Toronto Public Health, told AFP via email that, if worn correctly, a cloth mask is unlikely to reduce oxygen intake.\n\n\u201cIn general, a cloth mask does not fit tightly to the face. Air can still go around the mask as well as through the pores in the material,\u201d while acting as a barrier to small virus particles, she said.\n\nThis was confirmed by Dr. Shelley Payne, director of the LaMontagne Center for Infectious Disease at the University of Texas at Austin who told AFP via email: \u201cA properly fitted mask will not cause hypoxia (oxygen deprivation).\u201d\n\nAs for increased toxin intake due to mask wearing, Jean-Luc Gala, Head of Clinic at Saint-Luc University in Brussels, Belgium told AFP via email: \u201cWe don\u2019t exhale toxins, we exhale carbon dioxide,\u201d meaning \u201creinhalation,\u201d and therefore \u201cincreased toxin intake,\u201d would not occur.\n\nClaim: Compromises immune system, making you more likely to get sick\n\nThis claim was also made in social media posts previously fact-checked by AFP here, and is based on the assumption that masks decrease oxygen intake and increase CO2 intake, both of which are false.\n\n\u201cHealthcare workers spend eight hours a day wearing a mask and do not develop secondary infections or health problems,\u201d Yves Coppieters, epidemiologist and public health professor at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles, told AFP by email.\n\nClaim: Cross-contamination from repeated use or misuse\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence to support that repeated mask wearing leads to toxicity of any sort,\u201d though \u201cthere is a theoretical risk of contamination by microbes with repeated use if contaminated,\u201d Alon Vaisman, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Toronto, told AFP via email.\n\n\u201cAppropriate handling of masks will lead to substantial decrease in risk of contamination,\u201d Vaisman added.\n\nBoth Health Canada and the province of Ontario have issued best practices guidelines for face coverings, which state that masks must be clean before use and disposed of if not washable.\n\n\u201cA mask should fit comfortably and be easy to breathe to avoid frequent adjustments of the mask while using it,\u201d Dubey said.\n\nDubey and Health Canada are both clear that, when masks are used correctly, they will reduce the risk of contamination.\n\nThe flyer claims that surgical ear loop masks come with the warning: \u201cThis product is not a respirator and will not provide any protection against COVID-19 (coronavirus) or other viruses or contaminants.\u201d\n\nThe wording matches that in misleading social media posts fact-checked by AFP here.\n\nShane Shapera, Director of Toronto General Hospital\u2019s Interstitial Lung Disease Program, told AFP by email: \u201cThe purpose of wearing a surgical mask during the COVID-19 pandemic is to protect others from the wearer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is excellent data showing us that the main way that COVID-19 spreads is through infected patients coughing or sneezing and having those droplets land in the mouth and nose of people nearby,\u201d Shapera said.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that by having everyone protect each other, that will eventually protect you. (ie. if you and I are both wearing masks, your mask protects me while my mask protects you).\u201d\n\nPayne added that the probability of spread \u201cis highest if the carrier or case is not wearing a mask and lowest if both the carrier and contact are masked.\u201d\n\nThe flyer also lists a number of exemptions to orders mandating the wearing of face coverings. They are broadly accurate, but AFP has not found a Canadian provincial or local authority with the exact same exemptions as listed in the post.\n\nWearing a face mask or face covering indoors has not been made mandatory by the federal government, but is recommended by Health Canada.\n\nQuebec is the only province to have made face coverings mandatory in all indoor public places where social distancing is not possible.\n\nThe official mandate has permanent exemptions for children under the age of 12, people whose particular medical condition prevents them from wearing a mask or face covering, including those who are unable to put it on or take it off by themselves, and other temporary exemptions.\n\nSimilar exemptions exist in the rules established by Nova Scotia, Toronto, Ottawa and those soon to go into effect in Calgary, but these jurisdictions require masks for children over the age of two.\n\nOther provinces, such as British Columbia and Alberta, have not implemented mandatory mask orders.\n\nThe premier of Ontario, Doug Ford said in this May 22 press conference that, \u201cAny business has the right to refuse anyone, that's their business.\u201d\n\nBut the flyer is accurate in its claim that businesses cannot ask a customer to prove their exemption, as highlighted in Toronto, Ottawa and Calgary bylaws, leaving merchants in a difficult position when they try to enforce mask regulations.\n\nThe flyer claims that businesses cannot refuse to serve someone who is exempt as it would constitute a violation of the \u201cOntario Human Rights Code as well as the Regional Bylaws.\u201d\n\nThe Ontario Human Rights Code does protect people with disabilities from discrimination and harassment \u201cwhen receiving goods, services and using facilities,\u201d but courts have not yet ruled on a specific case regarding mask requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe post also accurately says that \u201cconstitutional lawyer, Rocco Galati, currently has a large constitutional claim filed for COVID-19 unlawful laws.\u201d Galati filed legal action on behalf of Vaccine Choice Canada, which can be found here.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked more than 560 examples of false or misleading information about the novel coronavirus.
