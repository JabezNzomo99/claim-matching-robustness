The pope was actually making the ASL sign for \u201cI love you\u201d at the Mall of Asia arena in the Philippines in January 2015, per the photo caption.\n\nWhile the ASL sign does bear some resemblance to the \u201csign of the horns\u201d some view as a satanic gesture, it has a key difference. The \u201csign of the horns\u201d needs the thumb toward the palm; the \u201cI love you\u201d sign needs it to be extended.\n\nThe \u201csign of the horns\u201d has cultural meanings unrelated to satanism, including showing spirit for sports teams at some universities and expressing enthusiasm at heavy metal concerts.", "lang": "en"}
