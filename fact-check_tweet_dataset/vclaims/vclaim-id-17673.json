No, that's not true: While during the 2016 presidential campaign candidate Trump called for \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on,\" his series of executive orders as president limited entry only for people from a short list of Muslim-majority countries and not to visitors of a specific religion.\n\nThe misleading claim has been made in a widely-shared meme, including in a post (archived here) published on May 3, 2019. It opened with a quote from Vice President Michael Pence about protecting religious freedom, followed by a comment that Trump banned an \"entire religion\":\n\nPresident Trump has taken steps to ensure that the Federal Government will never, ever penalize anyone for their religious beliefs ever again. Well, you know, except for that one time when he banned an ENTIRE RELIGION from entering the country.\n\nThe meme looked like this on social media:\n\nVice President Pence's quote was delivered in his National Day of Prayer speech on May 2, 2019. You can read the full speech here.\n\nThe comment that followed claiming that Trump had \"banned an ENTIRE RELIGION\" is rooted in Trump's real campaign call for a ban on an entire religion -- Islam -- soon after the San Bernardino terror attacks by two Muslims.\" \"Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on,\" Trump said. Watch it here:\n\nTrump renewed his call for a Muslim ban months later after the Orlando, Florida, nightclub attack by a Muslim.\n\nA week after Trump took office, he signed an executive order to temporarily suspend immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations and the entry of Syrian refugees. While it did not specify banning Muslims, federal judges upheld legal challenges that it violated constitutional religious liberties. Trump's campaign calls for a Muslim ban were cited as support for the decision to prevent implementation.\n\nIt took two more executive orders before Trump could get a court to allow a travel ban. Opponents argued each time that the orders equaled a ban based on religion, with the Trump lawyers contending the orders were based national security concerns. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the third version, which restricted entry of nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, North Korea and Venezuela, in a 5-4 decision. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the court's majority opinion that the order was \"facially neutral toward religion.\" Read the full opinion here.\n\nWhile Trump made a campaign promise to ban an \"entire religion,\" he never pursued it as president. While his executive orders prevented some Muslims from entering the United States, he never \"banned an entire religion.\" This meme is false.\n\nClick here to see a full timeline of the \"Muslim ban\" controversy", "lang": "en"}
