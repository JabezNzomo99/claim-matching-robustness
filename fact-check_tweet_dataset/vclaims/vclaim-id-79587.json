Eric Cantor in the 7th District Republican primary on Tuesday.\n\nLaura Ingraham, a conservative radio talk show host, headlined a June 3 rally for Brat at Henrico County\u2019s Dominion Club and quickly brought up immigration.\n\nShe noted that Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., held a May 28 rally in Richmond and urged Cantor to allow the House to vote on immigration reforms. Cantor, the House majority leader, has blocked votes on a comprehensive immigration bill and an amendment to the defense authorization bill that would allow children of illegal immigrants to join the military and receive legal status once they\u2019ve served.\n\nCantor has signaled, however, that he might support a narrowly drawn bill establishing a path to citizenship for children who were brought into the country illegally by their parents. That\u2019s spurred Brat to label Cantor weak on immigration and claim the majority leader is quietly working on a deal with Gutierrez to pass reforms. Brat said Gutierrez\u2019s appearance in Virginia was designed to bolster Cantor\u2019s credentials as tough on immigration prior to the GOP primary.\n\nIngraham picked up that note, saying the immigration rally was \"beautifully choreographed.\" She likened Cantor and Gutierrez to a touring \"Simon and Garfunkel in the 70s.\"\n\nIngraham said of the two politicians, \"They\u2019re touring the country last year talking \u2018How to Make Life Work\u2019 -- some ridiculous, meaningless titled tour -- joined at the hip, working together, in a bipartisan fashion indeed for the goal of immigration reform.\"\n\nThe Cantor-Gutierrez national immigration tour was news to us. So we looked into Ingraham\u2019s claim.\n\nJulia Hahn, Ingraham\u2019s executive producer, said the radio personality was referring to a widely publicized \"Becoming America Pilgrimage\" held July 25-27, 2013. The , organized by the non-profit Institute for Faith & Politics, took lawmakers to Ellis Island, the Museum of Jewish Heritage and other sites around New York City.\n\nA delegation of about 100 people, including House members, academics and faith leaders, traveled from Washington for the event.\n\nAn in Politico previewing the New York event said it wasn\u2019t \"meant to hash out the nitty-gritty of legislation or debate the politics of specific immigration policies. But lawmakers hope it will be small step forward in Congress\u2019s effort to enact immigration reform.\"\n\nGutierrez and Cantor attended parts of the three-day event.\n\nCantor spoke at the Jewish Center of Jackson Heights in Queens about the \"special struggles that Jewish people had arriving in a country that often did not understand or welcome people of his faith and culture,\" according to a of his speech by the Faith & Politics Institute.\n\nHahn pointed to a of part of Cantor\u2019s address on the conservative Breitbart.com website. It shows Cantor acknowledging Gutierrez in the audience and saying, \"Luis, thank you for the leadership you\u2019re providing through thick and thin right now as we try and navigate these very tough political times and choppy waters. My hat is off to you.\"\n\nRay Allen Jr., a Cantor political adviser, said the majority leader\u2019s recognition of Gutierrez was a simple courtesy.\n\n\"No, Congressman Cantor did not tour the country with Congressman Gutierrez,\" Allen emailed. \"No, they had no meetings on immigration and no, they never talked prior to Mr. Gutierrez coming to Richmond to attack Eric Cantor for stopping the Senate\u2019s comprehensive immigration plan. And yes, despite what the Left says, we believe it is an amnesty plan.\"\n\nDouglas Rivlin, a spokesman for Gutierrez, said while the Illinois congressman sat in on Cantor\u2019s speech in New York, Gutierrez only attended about 12 hours of the three-day immigration pilgrimage.\n\nRivlin also said his office checked the congressman\u2019s schedule and found Gutierrez \"has never once had a meeting with Majority Leader Eric Cantor on any issue, including immigration.\"\n\nRivlin also said that beyond the \"Becoming America Pilgrimage,\" he\u2019s not aware of any other immigration-related events that Gutierrez and Cantor both attended.\n\nWe asked Ingraham\u2019s executive producer if, beyond the New York event, she could name other immigration functions Cantor and Gutierrez attended. She came up empty.\n\nIngraham said Cantor and Gutierrez were \"touring the country last year \u2026 joined at the hip, working together in a bipartisan fashion indeed for the goal of immigration reform.\"\n\nCantor and Gutierrez were among 100 leaders who attended a pilgrimage to the New York City area last July that focused on immigration issues. Aides say that\u2019s the only immigration event Cantor and Gutierrez both happened to attend and that the two lawmakers have never met to discuss immigration.\n\nOne event in New York does not make a national tour. Ingraham can\u2019t point to another immigration gig Cantor and Gutierrez both attended. Her likening the two politicians to Simon and Garfunkel \"joined at the hip\" on a tour to promote immigration reform is not only false, it\u2019s ridiculous.", "lang": "en"}
