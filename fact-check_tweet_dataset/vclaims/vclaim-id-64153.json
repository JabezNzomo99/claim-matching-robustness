On the national stage, the phrase \"under God\" was used during the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance at the start of each night of the 2020 DNC.\n\nThe phrase \"under God\" was omitted from at least two recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance at individual caucus meetings during the DNC in 2020.\n\nA rumor circulated on social media during the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in August 2020 alleging that the DNC had omitted the phrase \u201cunder God\u201d from the Pledge of Allegiance. The following text (also shown in the above-displayed meme), for instance, was copied and pasted to multiple accounts on Facebook:\n\nThis statement is misleading at best. The DNC did not omit \u201cunder God\u201d from the pledge, nor did they forbid its use. In fact, during every recitation of the pledge before each night\u2019s events \u2014 the 2020 DNC lasted four nights \u2014 the phrase \u201cunder God\u201d was included.\n\nHere, for example, is a video of Cedric Richmond Jr., the son of Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., reciting the pledge (and saying \u201cunder God\u201d) during the final night of the DNC.\n\nHere are links to videos of \u201cunder God\u201d being said during the pledge on nights one, two, and three.\n\nPolitical conventions are sprawling events. In addition to the \u201cmain events\u201d that take place during the nationally televised program each night, individual caucuses and councils also meet throughout the week.\n\nOn Aug. 17, for instance, the first day of the DNC, the Hispanic Caucus, the Labor Council, the AAPI Caucus, the Black Caucus, the Interfaith Council, the Ethnic Council, the Youth Council, and the Women\u2019s Caucus all held meetings prior to the night\u2019s nationally televised program. In at least two of these meetings of smaller individual caucuses \u2014 the LGBTQ caucus meeting and the Muslim Delegates Assembly on Aug. 18 \u2014 the phrase \u201cunder God\u201d was omitted from the pledge.\n\nDavid Brody of the Christian Broadcasting Network brought attention to both of these instances on Twitter. Here\u2019s one of the videos posted by Brody:\n\nThe phrase \u201cunder God\u201d was omitted from at least two recitations of the pledge during the DNC in 2020. Both of these instances occurred during individual council meetings. On the national stage, however, the phrase \u201cunder God\u201d was spoken during the recitation of the pledge during each of the DNC\u2019s four nights.", "lang": "en"}
