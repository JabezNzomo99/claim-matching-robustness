This fact check features their work:\n\nIn late February, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry launched a Russia-wide tour for its so-called \u201ctrophy train,\u201d an 18-car train hauling vehicles and equipment captured from \u201cterrorists\u201d in Syria. Some of the vehicles were indeed used by terrorist groups like Islamic State (IS), which captured large quantities of American-made military equipment during its 2014 offensive in Iraq, including Humvees like the ones on display on the train.\n\nUpon closer examination, however, open source intelligence investigators noticed certain distortions and in some case, fabrications, in the traveling exhibition. In April, a group of independent bloggers in Russia known as the Conflict Intelligence Team evaluated some of the train\u2019s exhibits and found that many of them could not be properly sourced, and were in some cases \u201cblatant propaganda.\u201d\n\nAccording to CIT, some of the weapons can be identified from their specific modifications as well as insignia. One example is a Humvee captured from Iraq\u2019s Counter-Terrorism Service, which is readily identifiable by its still-intact insignia and black paint job. Other vehicles are unique, such as the so-called \u201cEagle head\u201d improvised armored vehicle captured from the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) by IS, and subsequently captured from IS by Syrian government forces.\n\nCuriously, the information display attached to that exhibit claims the vehicle was assembled in Turkey. Given that Turkey views the YPG as an arm of the Kurdish Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), which Ankara has designated a terrorist group, and that Turkish authorities closed the border with the Kurdish-controlled regions of Syria, it is unlikely that the YPG would assemble a large armored vehicle in Turkey and drive it across the fortified border.\n\nThe CIT team found two clear fabrications. One is a T-55 tank, which the exhibit claims was delivered to the rebels from Georgia, a country with an ongoing border dispute with Russia and its local proxies. Based on the tank\u2019s modifications, the CIT team determined that it was most likely sold to the Syrian government by Ukraine in the 1990s. It was most likely captured by rebels, then recaptured by Syrian government forces.\n\nLastly, the CIT calls a collection of equipment described by the Russian exhibit as a \u201cmilitant chemical lab\u201d the \u201cmost blatant example of deliberate disinformation.\u201d Experts from Bellingcat and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) determined that the equipment could not be used to manufacture chemical weapons, and was more likely used for making explosives.\n\nThis is not the first time Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry has falsely labeled \u201ctrophies\u201d from Syria. Last year, Polygraph.info published a fact-check showing how the ministry mislabeled a French-made ANPILAS rocket launcher, claiming it was a much more advanced American FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank guided missile.", "lang": "en"}
