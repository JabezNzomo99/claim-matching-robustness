The claim is false; the photo actually shows a Canadian girl who died in 2018 from neuroblastoma, a cancer that develops from immature nerve cells.\n\nThe post shares a photo of a young girl smiling and putting her thumbs up with text superimposed across the image saying: \u201cMy vaccines gave me cancer\u201d.\n\nThe text across the bottom of the image says: \u201cNow I\u2019m being poisoned to death with nitrogen mustard gas\u201d.\n\nThe lengthy caption of the post says in part: \u201cThis little girl is merely one of thousands across the United States with cancer from vaccines. Those 'children's hospitals' are NOT hospitals they are extermination compounds. First they give kids cancer in their shots and then they put them down with nitrogen mustard gas otherwise known as chemotherapy.\u201d\n\nThe post has been shared more than 600 times since it was uploaded to Facebook on January 11.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nBut the person in the photograph is not a young American girl who got cancer from her vaccines.\n\nA reverse image search on Google led to this report from Canadian broadcaster CTV on August 7, 2018.\n\nThe caption of the original photo reads: \u201cNevaeh Denine, a 9-year-old girl from St. John\u2019s, N.L., who raised thousands of dollars for other kids with cancer, has died after a battle with neuroblastoma\u201d.\n\nThe premier of Newfoundland and Labrador and mayor of St John\u2019s both tweeted their condolences following Denine\u2019s death, see here and here.\n\nThe report coordinates with this Facebook post uploaded on the same day. The post says Denine was \u201cwelcomed into heaven in her daddy\u2019s loving arms\u201d, along with the dates of her birth and death.\n\nThe Facebook page, called \u201cHappiness for Nevaeh\u201d, states on its \u201cAbout\u201d page here that Denine was \u201cdiagnosed with neuroblastoma in December 2013, but relapsed February 2016\u201d.\n\nAccording to Minnesota-based medical centre Mayo Clinic here, neuroblastoma is a type of cancer caused by immature nerve cells forming a tumor, instead of maturing by birth.\n\n\u201cNeuroblastoma is a cancer that develops from immature nerve cells found in several areas of the body. Neuroblastoma most commonly arises in and around the adrenal glands, which have similar origins to nerve cells and sit atop the kidneys. However, neuroblastoma can also develop in other areas of the abdomen and in the chest, neck and near the spine, where groups of nerve cells exist. Neuroblastoma most commonly affects children age 5 or younger, though it may rarely occur in older children.\u201d\n\nThe same photograph in a larger size that shows Denine\u2019s dress as well as her face was originally posted to the Facebook page here on March 12, 2017.", "lang": "en"}
