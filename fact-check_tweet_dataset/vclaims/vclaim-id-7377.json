No, that's not true: the same story has appeared earlier on various fake news sites and was said to have happened in Elgin, Illinois and Katy, Texas before. It is not real.\n\nThe latest form of the story appeared in from an article published on NewsView on August 19, 2018 titled \"Salina, KS man booked a prostitute - and she turned out to be his wife\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nA 52-year old man in Salina, Kansas was taken by surprise after a prostitute he hired through a website turned out to be his own wife of the past 19 years. The man had been using the site for some months to hire prostitutes and meet them for sex at motels in neighboring areas. Last weekend, the man told his wife he was going out drinking with work colleagues, when in reality he was travelling to a motel on the outskirts of town.

The man had been using the site for some months to hire prostitutes and meet them for sex at motels in neighboring areas.\n\nAnother version from yet another different site placed the events in Katy, Texas:\n\nHowever both sites previously pushing the story, United News and The Telegrap Sun, used to belong to a now defunct network of fake news websites that often published the same stories about bizarre accidents or weird sex tales over and over again but with locations and names changed.\n\nIt is unclear if the site that published the \"Salina, KS\" version of the story is part of the same network or if they just copied the article from somewhere else and changed the location. We were unable to find any other site that published a copy of the story mentioning that town so we are assuming they were the ones that changed it.", "lang": "en"}
