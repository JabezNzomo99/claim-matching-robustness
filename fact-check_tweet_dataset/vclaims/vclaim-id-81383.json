The email alleges that since then, subsequent meetings have taken place with the state government to convince them on the issue.\n\nThe fake email also lists nine diabolical steps to go about converting Lingayats to Catholicism. These include sponsoring 100 Lingayat scholars to develop material which could prove \"spiritual supremacy of Lingayats over other Hindus.\" The fake email also lists a goal of evangelizing at least 5% of Lingayats by 2043 and by 2020 building \"emotional bridges\" with Lingayat saints and Mutts. This can be achieved through European Union's developmental schemes and through funds exploited through the \"Embassy of the Holy See\", the fake email claims.\n\nThe fake email has been shared by many including a Twitter handle named Swami Nischalanand, who later deleted his tweet. (Click here to view an archived version of it)\n\nHis tweet was shared by Subramanian Swamy's verified Facebook page.\n\nThe email spins a convenient narrative and gives unnecessary background for a supposedly internal mail between bishops who are alleged to be co-conspirators.\n\nThe email stands out as peculiar because of the way it reads. Skipping articles such as 'the' in several places suggesting it was written by a non-native speaker of English. The reference of \"harvesting of souls\" is almost exclusively used as a sarcastic and derogatory reference by the Hindutva right-wing while speaking about so called forced religious conversions in India. The word 'reap' has been misspelt as 'rip'. Even the apostrophe in the name of the organisation (Catholic Bishops' Conference of India) has been placed incorrectly.\n\nFurthermore, the email was purported to be sent by His Eminence Oswald Cardinal Gracias to Dr. Bernard Moras, Archbishop of Bangalore. However, the signatory of the email is supposedly the 'Secretary General' whereas Oswald Gracias is the president of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India.\n\nIn a strongly-worded clarification, the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India called the email a fake and said that it reserved the right to take legal action against those involved in making and promoting the letter. The letter signed by Bishop Theodore Mascarenhas, the actual secretary general of the religious organisation also questioned the timing of the letter on the eve of elections in Karnataka and called the document a \"disgraceful mischievous ploy\".\n\nThe issue of granting a separate religious identity to the numerically significant and politically decisive community has become a hot potato in poll-bound Karnataka.\n\nALSO READ - Who Are The Lingayats?
