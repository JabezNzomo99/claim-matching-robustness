Let\u2019s try to analyze it.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be found here.\n\nClaim: India\u2019s National Anthem \u2018Jana Gana Mana\u2019 is declared by the UNESCO as the best anthem in the world. Fact: UNESCO\u2019s official website has a document saying that the news \u2018Jana Gana Mana\u2019 declared by the UNESCO as the best anthem in the world is a rumor. Hence the claim is FALSE\n\nWhen visited the official UNESCO website , a document was found regarding various rumors and fake news spread across the world in the name of UNESCO. In that document it can be found that the news \u2018Jana Gana Mana\u2019 being declared as the world\u2019s best anthem by UNESCO was one of the favorite rumors.\n\nThe misinformation spreading about the national anthem is not new. The same news was viral 11 years back and has been shared by many during these eleven years. When searched for the news on the Google, an India Today news article published in 2008, where it terms the news as false, can be found.\n\nHence, the claim made in the post stands to be FALSE.", "lang": "en"}
