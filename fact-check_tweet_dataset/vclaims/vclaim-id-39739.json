The segment touched on the involvement of the Wagner Group, a Russian private military company, and the murder of three Russian journalists who had been investigating Wagner\u2019s activities in CAR last year.\n\nVesti Nedeli\u2019s special correspondent Alexander Rogatkin visited a CAR military base where Russian instructors who train local soldiers were present, and spoke with a Russian man named Gennady Ivanov, who was identified as a \u201csenior military instructor.\u201d Ivanov said the Russian instructors have \u201cno relationship to PMC Wagner,\u201d and that they work \u201cby contract.\u201d However, he did not specify on whose contract they were working there.\n\nThis denial is problematic, given that Russia has laws banning \u201cmercenary activities.\u201d While two articles of Russian law prohibit mercenary activities and creation of unlawful military groups, it allows such firms to operate under the umbrella of military consulting and security guards. Wagner claims to be exactly that -- a private military company providing consulting and security guard services. Independent journalists in Russia uncovered connections between a mercenary group dating back to 2013 and a former GRU officer Dmitry Utkin who went by the alias \u201cWagner.\"\n\nShortly after the three Russian journalists were murdered in the Central Africa Republic, the Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman admitted \u201cthe presence of Russian instructors\u201d avoiding any reference to Wagner\u2019s presence or mention of its role in active combat in Ukraine and Syria. On April 15, 2018, Maxim Borodin, a Russian journalist from Ekaterinburg who had been investigating the deaths of Wagner mercenaries in Syria, died from injuries sustained after falling from either the balcony or window of his fifth floor apartment.\n\nOn Vesti Nedeli, Ivanov\u2019s statement was seemingly refuted in the same segment, when the camera focused in on a sheet of paper displaying a list of guidelines for Russian military personnel. It was titled \u201cThe Fighter\u2019s Ten Commandments,\u201d and the first \u201ccommandment\u201d read: \u201cDefend the interests of Russia always and everywhere.\u201d\n\nSome of the commandments contradicted Ivanov\u2019s claims about who the \u201cinstructors\u201d are and what they are doing in CAR. Thus, while the second \u201ccommandment\u201d stated that \u201c[t]he honor of a Russian soldier is above all,\u201d Ivanov said he and the other Russians were simply working \u201cunder contract.\u201d The next \u201ccommandment\u201d stated: \u201cFight not for money, but from principle! There is one principle - victory!\u201d Again, Ivanov claimed he and his men work \u201cby contract,\u201d meaning they are in fact working for money.\n\nBut the most revealing thing was the image that appeared under the text of the \u201cThe Fighter\u2019s Ten Commandments -- that of a medal issued by the Wagner group to its men who fought in Ukraine and Syria. This is not a Russian military medal, and Russian media have confirmed that it is a Wagner award.\n\nWhile there is strong evidence that Wagner was originally affiliated with the Russian state, since 2017 it has become associated with Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian businessman with close ties to the Kremlin who has benefited immensely from, among other ventures, contracts with the Russian Defense Ministry. Prigozhin came under U.S. sanctions in 2016, and several of his companies, including Concord Management and Consulting, were added to the sanctions list in 2017. The U.S. District of Columbia court in 2018 indicted Prigozhin and several of his firms including Internet Research Agency, often known as the \u201ctroll factory,\u201d along with twelve employees for alleged interference in the U.S. 2016 presidential elections.\n\nOn September 30, the U.S. Treasury Department announced additional sanctions against Prigozhin, targeting his private assets.\n\nOn October 2, the Russian independent media site Meduza reported on the death of 10 to 35 Russian mercenaries in Libya. Earlier, Bloomberg had reported on the presence of approximately 100 Russian mercenaries affiliated with Wagner, who were in the country supporting the Libyan National Army leader Khalifa Haftar, who is supported by Moscow.", "lang": "en"}
