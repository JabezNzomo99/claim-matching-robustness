The construction of the stadium is not yet been completed.\n\nThe magazine reported that some 110 North Koreans working to build Zenit Arena were essentially \u201cslaves and hostages,\u201d and revealed details in a case that appears to involve both major corruption and grave human rights abuses.\n\nRussian officials categorically denied there was any abuse of the immigrant workers at the construction sites for the 2018 World Cup.\n\nIn a lengthy statement, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova called the accusations \u201cfake,\u201d and further described them as a Western plot aimed at \u201cscaring off\u201d foreign football fans from visiting Russia.\n\nRussian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko, who was the country\u2019s sports minister when the doping scandal erupted, said Russia is the victim of a \u201cnegative information campaign\u201d that is \u201cspecially arranged by some foreign media.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have no knowledge of the abuse of rights of workers from North Korea,\u201d said Alexey Sorokin, director general of the 2018 World Cup organizing committee.\n\nAfter the Josimar article was published, the presidents of the Swedish, Danish, Norwegian and Icelandic football associations wrote to FIFA president Gianni Infantino expressing their concern about the North Koreans working on construction of the St. Petersburg stadium.\n\nInfantino responded with a letter acknowledging that a FIFA inspection group which visited St. Petersburg last November found \u201cstrong evidence for the presence of the North Korean workers on the construction site in St. Petersburg.\u201d Infantino\u2019s letter added that these issues \u201cwere subsequently raised with the respective company and with the general contractor.\u201d\n\n\u201cFIFA is aware of and firmly condemns the often appalling conditions under which North Korean workers are employer in various countries around the world,\u201d the FIFA president wrote.\n\nLast November, Marzuki Darusman, United Nations special rapporteur on human rights in North Korea, said he would probe allegations that an estimated 20,000 North Koreans are working in slave-like conditions abroad, mainly in China, Russia and the Middle East.\n\nThe popular Russian photo-blogger Ilya Varlamov followed up the Norwegian magazine report with his own investigation, confirming the suspicions of both corruption and the slave-like treatment of North Korean workers building the stadium in St. Petersburg.", "lang": "en"}
