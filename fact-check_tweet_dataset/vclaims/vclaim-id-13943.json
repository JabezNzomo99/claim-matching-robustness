This is apparent if one watches the 25-second clip. Kumar did not say \u201capmaan (disrespect)\u201d but said \u201capharan (kidnap)\u201d.\n\nHis complete statement is \u2013 \u201c\u0926\u0942\u0938\u0930\u0947 \u0915\u0940 \u092a\u0924\u094d\u0928\u0940 \u091c\u094b \u0939\u0948 \u0909\u0928\u0915\u093e \u0905\u092a\u0939\u0930\u0923 \u0939\u0941\u0906 \u0909\u0938\u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u0932\u0902\u0915\u093e \u091c\u0932\u093e \u0926\u0940. \u0914\u0930 \u092f\u0939\u093e\u0901 \u0939\u0928\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0928 \u091c\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0928\u093e\u092e \u092a\u0947 \u0905\u092a\u0928\u0947 \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u094b\u0917\u094b \u0915\u093e \u0918\u0930 \u091c\u0932\u093e \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0939\u0948. (Hanuman ji burnt Lanka for another man\u2019s wife and here, in the name of Hanuman ji, the houses of our own people are burning.)\u201d Upon searching for videos of Kumar with the keywords \u2013 \u201cKahnaiya Kumar Hanuman speech\u201d \u2013 we found that this particular speech is at least a year old. Kumar was talking about the appropriation of Hanuman, who has now become a prominent symbol of Hindutva.\n\nMisinformation targeting Kanhaiya Kumar has often found a place in social media. Earlier, another one of his speeches was presented with false rhetoric.", "lang": "en"}
