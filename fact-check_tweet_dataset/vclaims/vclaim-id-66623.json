Production companies can earn a 20 percent income tax credit on in-state costs of projects worth at least $500,000.\n\nAnother 10 percent credit is given for using a Georgia logo in production credits.\n\nThe MPAA used the federal government\u2019s own data, compiled by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, in calculating the total job and wage estimates.\n\nThe BLS data broad categories of motion pictures and broadcasting show an annual average of 20,869 employees and total annual wages of $1.55 billion in 2013.\n\nBut the MPAA drills down deeper into those broad categories and others, excluding the recording artists covered in the broad category but captures jobs from other categories \u2013 such as payroll workers and electricians \u2013 it can show work in the film or TV industry, said Julia Jenks, the vice president of research for the MPAA.\n\nIn some of those more specific groups, such as cable TV production, all of the jobs and pay count toward the MPAA tally.\n\nOthers, such as costume rental and wardrobe, are counted based on U.S. Census or research calculations that tell what proportion of those jobs work in the industry. The MPAA calls that its adjustment factor on the government figures.\n\n\"It\u2019s our best estimate, and a very conservative estimate,\" Jenks said.\n\nUsing those parameters, the BLS counts 48,539 jobs but the MPAA tally for Georgia is 24,162:\n\nUsing the BLS tables, PolitiFact Georgia was able to replicate all of the job figures, except in three categories.\n\nThe 2013 quarterly census shows 303 jobs in audio/video reproduction \u2013 exactly double the MPAA\u2019s count.\n\nAnd, the official BLS data does not have an annual average for jobs in the one category few think of as a movie industry gig: working in movie and drive-in theaters, economist Timothy Ewing said.\n\nA nine-month average is available for those jobs, which have high turnover. But that means they are comparable to the yearly figures in other categories.\n\nEwing could not comment on the adjustments the MPAA made in categories, other than to note it would create more conservative estimates.\n\nSo, using the BLS-confirmed data, and the MPAA\u2019s own adjustments, the total number of jobs drops to 20,873.\n\nBut the MPAA is conservative in other ways. It does not include at all freelance workers common in production, who provide contract work in, say, makeup or construction.\n\nPolitiFact Georgia recently showed that Tyler Perry\u2019s new studio planned for Fort McPherson will alone create between 2,000 to 6,000 of those jobs.\n\nIt is reasonable to think the MPAA could easily reach its 24,000 jobs figure if it counted contract work on the 23 movies or 39 TV series filmed in Georgia in 2013.\n\nThe question remains if those jobs, and their pay, are truly Georgia jobs. The state incentive allows movie companies to get credits on what they pay stars, and accountants, for the time they work in the state.\n\nThe MPAA released data this week to bolster its lobbying to fast-track a trade deal that would open more of Asia to its content.\n\nIt claimed the industry supported 24,000 direct jobs and paid workers more than $1.68 billion in the Peach State in 2013.\n\nFederal data confirms nearly all of the job figures and payroll, many of which have been reduced from the official headcount.\n\nThe MPAA overreaches in deciding movie theater workers such as ushers are industry workers, versus retail employees. But those jobs would likely be outweighed by freelance workers on production sets, which the MPAA did not count in its tally.\n\nWe rate the group\u2019s claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
