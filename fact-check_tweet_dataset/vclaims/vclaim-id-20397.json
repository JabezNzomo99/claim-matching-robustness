He was trapped and died when workers filled the oven with six tons of canned tuna and turned it up to 270 degrees to cook and sterilize the food.\n\nAngel Rodriguez, the plant operations director; Saul Florez, the safety manager; and Bumble Bee Foods all faced three counts of violating Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules. Bumble Bee Foods settled the case in August 2015 for $6 million.\n\nTo be clear, no one chopped up Melena and put his remains in the meat.\n\nA website called TheRacketReport.com posted the story excerpt on April 28, 2015, the same day the AP story was published. It carried the headline, \"Massive Bumble Bee Recall After 2 Employees Admit Cooking A Man And Mixing Him With A Batch Of Tuna.\"\n\nThe story doesn\u2019t mention anyone being mixed in with the fish, despite the headline. The site\u2019s About Us link noted that \"the articles and stories may or may not use real names, always a semi real and/or mostly, or substantially, fictitious ways.\"\n\nFast forward to the following year.\n\nOn March 16, 2016, Bumble Bee Foods did issue a real recall for \"process deviations,\" and not for the incident related Melena.\n\nFake news site News4KTLA.com recycled the AP story about the workers being charged in Melena\u2019s death the next day. The post also re-used the fake headline \"Massive Bumble Bee Recall After 2 Employees Admit Cooking A Man And Mixing Him With A Batch Of Tuna.\"\n\nThe site attempts to look like a real media outlet, but does not give an indication it is fake, saying it covers \"southern Louisiana and the surrounding area.\" The real KTLA TV station is based in Los Angeles. The fake headline has been passed around ever since.\n\nWe rate the headline Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
