MPs disagree\n\nThe government plans to \u201ccurtail\u201d the future growth of subsidised onshore wind power, which it says will help bill payers. It plans to do this using a couple of measures contained in the Energy Bill, as we\u2019ve discussed in the past. The changes have been controversial.\n\nAlso controversial, it seems, is the exact contribution wind power is currently making to the UK\u2019s energy supply. While debating the Bill on Monday, MPs disputed each other\u2019s statistics on how much of the UK\u2019s electricity comes from wind turbines.\n\nAlthough it seemed like they couldn\u2019t all be right, they were. Over the course of a year wind produces about 11% of the UK\u2019s electricity, but at times that can dip to below 1%.\n\n\u201cBefore the debate today, I checked and discovered that 1% of our power is currently being generated from wind, 30% from coal and 42% from gas.\u201d \u201cI would simply say that when we talk about this, whatever the personal positions that may come into it, we should not try to introduce personal facts, because some of the things said today are simply untrue. The figure for the contribution of UK wind to our electricity mix during the past 24 hours is 5%, not 1%.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear when exactly Mr Redwood checked the figures, but they\u2019re correct for the few hours before the debate started at about 5pm.\n\nThat\u2019s based on data from electricity administrators Elexon, which shows how much energy comes from different sources during half-hour periods.\n\nAt 4pm on the afternoon of the debate about 1% of electricity came from wind, 29% from coal, and 42% from gas.\n\nThe same figures show 5% of power had come from wind farms during the whole 24 hour period up to that point, as Mr Reynolds said.\n\nThe debate seems to have happened during a particularly placid day, at least where wind energy was concerned. As MPs were speaking wind power was beginning a slump that lasted a couple of days.\n\nAll of this goes to show that the electricity coming from wind can vary.\n\nBut taking one point in time, or even one 24 hour period, doesn\u2019t tell us much about what wind power contributes overall. MPs seemed to disagree on that too.\n\nMr Pincher is right about onshore wind. The difference in figures seems to be because he is talking about onshore wind alone, and during the windiest periods. Ms Nandy, on the other hand, seems to be using figures for both onshore and offshore wind that are averaged out across the year.\n\nFigures for the last year show wind turbines contributed a greater share of the UK\u2019s power in the winter months.\n\nOnshore wind on its own provided 7.3% of the UK\u2019s electricity from January to March of 2015, compared to 5% of it in the three months from July to September that year.\n\nWe don\u2019t have figures for the following three months yet. In the last full 12 months we have figures for\u2014the year beginning in October 2014\u20146.4% of electricity came from onshore wind.\n\nThat rises to 11% if you look at all wind power, including offshore turbines. It was 10% in the 2014/15 financial year, which started and ended six months earlier.", "lang": "en"}
