No, that's not true: a website with a reputation for inventing facts blew up a single unconfirmed tweet from two days ago into \"reports\" of an action that the FCC doesn't even has jurisdiction for.\n\nThe story went viral via an article published by YourNewsWire on May 23, 2018 titled \"CNN Raided By FCC For Deceiving American Public\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe CNN head office in Atlanta, Georgia, was raided by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) agents Tuesday in an operation related to the \"violation of press guidelines\" including \"publishing and promotion of blatantly false information designed to deceive the American public,\" according to reports. The FCC arrived unannounced and seized documents and hard drives as part of their investigation, including all of the \"source data\" the network has used for their stories. MSNBC and the Associated Press are also reported to have been raided by the FCC for violating press guidelines, including the \"printing of blatant lies\", the \"publishing and promotion of stories which require immediate retractions while not promoting the retractions\", according to a source within one of networks.\n\nStrong claims require strong evidence.

And do you really think CNN and MSNBC (and all their colleagues in the media) would not make a huge stink about such a raid if it happened? It would be the perfect opportunity to paint President Trump as an \"enemy of the First Amendment\". If you think their Stormy Daniels coverage was over the top, just imagine what wall-to-wall coverage a \"direct attack on press freedom\" by \"Trumps FCC\" would get if it really happened.\n\nYourNewsWire has published several hoaxes and fake news articles in the past so anything they write or publish should be taken with a large grain of salt. Their Facebook page \"The People's Voice\" recently lost its verification checkmark according to a report from MMFA.\n\nThe Terms of Use of the site also make it clear they don't really stand behind the accuracy of any of their reporting:\n\nThe site was profiled in the Hollywood reporter where it was described as:\n\nRationalWiki described it as:\n\nA while ago we also reported that YourNewsWire had rebranded itself as NewsPunch by changing its domain name in an apparent effort to evade filtering/blocking. It appears the site has changed back to it's old name in the mean time but you can still see the NewsPunch name in the contact email address in the footer.\n\nWe wrote about yournewswire.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: 20 Priests Killed In Plane Crash NOT Connected To Vatican Pedophile Ring\n\u2022 Fake News: CNN NOT To Permanently Close Its Doors As Ratings Plunge 30 Percent\n\u2022 Fake News: Pedophile Who Raped 5-Year-Old Boy NOT Found Dead With Testicles Removed\n\u2022 Fake News: Congress Did NOT Call For Immediate Arrest Of John Kerry For Treason", "lang": "en"}
