The claim also circulated on WhatsApp. The claim is misleading; the offices of the president and the former ministers cited in the misleading posts said no such committee was ever formed.\n\nThe claim was published on Facebook here on July 17, 2020.\n\nThe text image features a photo of President Rajapaksa posing with the expert committee that was appointed to review the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Sri Lanka compact. The MCC is a US-based international aid and development agency that in 2019 established a five-year agreement with the Sri Lankan government to promote economic growth.\n\nThe image also features three photos the former ministers referred to in the claim: Rohitha Abeygunawardena, Johnston Fernando and S.M. Chandrasena.\n\nThe Sinhala-language text in the image translates to English as: \u201cApparently the committee report of the three professors cannot be comprehended it seems!!\n\n\u201cSo he has appointed three people of his intelligence level to study that report!! Here\u2019s the trio!!\n\nThe MCC agreement was criticised by some due to concerns over Sri Lanka\u2019s sovereign integrity.\n\nIn December 2019, the Sri Lankan government appointed an expert committee to conduct an independent and professional review of the MCC\u2019s compact.\n\nA similar claim about Rajapaksa appointing another committee to analyse the expert committee\u2019s reports was also published on Facebook here, here and here.\n\nThe claim, however, is misleading.\n\n\u201cNo such committee has been appointed to further analyse the review report by the expert panel,\u201d Mohan Samaranayake, Rajapaksa\u2019s media division director, told AFP by phone on July 17, 2020.\n\nSamaranayake added that \u201cif such a decision was made, the announcement would definitely be made via official channels of the [President\u2019s Media Division (PMD)].\u201d\n\nA search of the PMD website and its Twitter feed found no announcement about the alleged new committee of former ministers.\n\nIn phone interviews with AFP, representatives for all three former ministers named in the misleading posts also denied the formation of a new panel to analyse the expert committee\u2019s MCC review report.\n\nIn July 2020, Rajapaksa did ask all ministers to submit their views on the MCC pact, however, there was no announcement of the alleged three-member committee.", "lang": "en"}
