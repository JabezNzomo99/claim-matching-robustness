Kavanaugh and what Kavanaugh\u2019s record shows on these issues.\n\nSeveral Democratic senators have claimed that Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s history shows he would be a danger on the court to the Affordable Care Act. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Aug. 28 on the Senate floor: \u201cJudge Kavanaugh has written opinions skeptical of our health care law, reproductive rights, and even the contraception coverage requirement.\u201d\n\nThe criticisms have focused on two dissents Kavanaugh wrote in cases challenging the constitutionality of the individual mandate, and a third dissent in a case challenging the ACA\u2019s contraception coverage accommodations for certain religious organizations. Also, Democrats have repeatedly stressed that a case in District Court in Texas could reach the Supreme Court and affect preexisting condition protections in the health care law. We\u2019ll look at the facts.\n\nWhat Democrats are saying: \u201cThere\u2019s a Texas case where that\u2019s being challenged right now, that\u2019s moving up, it could likely go before the Supreme Court. Well knowing your record, it is right that these Americans, so many of them with preexisting conditions are asking whether the Supreme Court will be an institution that affirms and protects the rights of people with access to healthcare,\u201d Sen. Cory Booker said during the first day of the confirmation hearings on Sept. 4. \u201cWe all know too many people who have set aside prescription drugs because they\u2019re too high, because of what corporations are doing there. People who have put off going to see the doctor because a visit is too expensive, that is in the balance with this nomination.\u201d\n\n\u201cJudge Kavanaugh, you wrote, for example, in Seven-Sky v. Holder that a president can disregard a law passed by Congress if he deems it to be unconstitutional, even if a court has upheld it,\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar said in the Sept. 4 hearing.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a July 9 tweet: \u201cJudge Kavanaugh\u2019s own writings make clear that \u2026 he would welcome challenges to the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nAlso in a July 9 tweet, Sen. Elizabeth Warren described Kavanaugh as being \u201chostile to health care for millions.\u201d\n\nWhat Kavanaugh\u2019s record shows: As an appellate judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Kavanaugh issued dissents in two cases that challenged the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate, which requires most people to have health insurance or pay a penalty on their tax returns. (The Republican tax law signed in December 2017 eliminated the tax penalty, effective for the 2019 tax year.)\n\nSeven-Sky v. Holder, 2011. The appeals court rejected this challenge to the ACA\u2019s individual mandate. Kavanaugh dissented, but his objection concerned the jurisdiction of the court, not the constitutionality of the health care law.\n\nKavanaugh wrote that the court shouldn\u2019t have heard the case because the Anti-Injunction Act said a tax must be assessed and collected before a suit against it could be decided. (The individual mandate didn\u2019t go into effect until the 2014 tax year.)\n\nHe argued that what the law referred to as \u201cpenalties\u201d were to be \u201cassessed and collected in the same manner as taxes.\u201d And he said he would \u201cleave these momentous constitutional issues for another day \u2013 a day that may never come.\u201d\n\nThere are differing views on what Kavanaugh\u2019s lengthy dissent may say about his stance on the ACA.\n\nOne commentator called it a \u201croadmap to save Obamacare,\u201d noting that Kavanaugh wrote that \u201cthis case could disappear by 2015 because, by then, Congress may fix the alleged constitutional shortcoming and ensure that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate provision fits comfortably within Congress\u2019 Taxing Clause power.\u201d In fact, the Supreme Court in 2012 in NFIB v. Sebelius upheld the constitutionality of the individual mandate under the taxing clause.\n\nBut on July 3, The Federalist published a second analysis that said the \u201croadmap\u201d claim was \u201cnonsense.\u201d Justin Walker, a former law clerk for Justice Anthony Kennedy and Kavanaugh, and an assistant professor at the University of Louisville Brandeis School of Law, wrote in that piece that Kavanaugh\u2019s dissent was actually a \u201croadmap\u201d for the Supreme Court dissenters in the NFIB v. Sebelius case.\n\nAnother former clerk for Kavanaugh, Sarah E. Pitlyk, wrote in the National Review that Kavanaugh said in his dissent that the taxing clause \u201chas not traditionally authorized a legal prohibition or mandate.\u201d And while \u201che ultimately determined that a challenge to Obamacare had to be brought later,\u201d she said, \u201che left no doubt about where he stood.\u201d\n\nBut Timothy S. Jost, an emeritus professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law and an expert on health care, wrote in a July 16 analysis of Kavanaugh\u2019s record for the Commonwealth Fund that the Supreme Court nominee didn\u2019t show \u201cstrong opposition\u201d to the health care law in this case, or the one we\u2019ll examine next.\n\n\u201cAfter a long discussion of the Tax Anti-Injunction Act in Seven-Sky, Kavanaugh concluded his opinion by musing about the possible invalidity of the mandate under Congress\u2019s commerce power,\u201d Jost wrote. \u201cOn the one hand, he entertained arguments that the mandate encroached on state authority and individual rights, but on the other, he suggested that it was a novel approach to providing safety-net services through the private sector. Seeing both sides of the argument, he concluded that the court should avoid a constitutional ruling until the case was properly before it.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar, and other Democrats, have highlighted one line in particular from Kavanaugh\u2019s dissent, where he says: \u201cOr the President might not enforce the individual mandate provision if the President concludes that enforcing it would be unconstitutional.\u201d In a footnote, Kavanaugh says: \u201cUnder the Constitution, the President may decline to enforce a statute that regulates private individuals when the President deems the statute unconstitutional, even if a court has held or would hold the statute constitutional.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar framed this as an executive power issue, not explicitly a health care issue.\n\nJost told us in a phone interview that it\u2019s \u201cnot unprecedented\u201d for a president to take the position that a law is unconstitutional, but it is \u201cvery controversial\u201d to hold that a president can refuse to enforce a statute after a court has upheld its constitutionality.\n\nOur fact-checking colleagues at PolitiFact.com spoke with several legal experts about this issue, finding: \u201cExperts generally agree that a president is not bound by a lower court\u2019s decision when deciding a law is unconstitutional but diverge on whether the Supreme Court has the final say.\u201d\n\nAbbe R. Gluck, a professor of law and the faculty director of the Solomon Center for Health Law and Policy at Yale Law School, told us in an email: \u201c[T]hat is indeed a very controversial position to take, one that embraces what I would say is a dangerously broad view of presidential power, especially in the case where a court has upheld the law in question.\u201d But Kavanaugh\u2019s statement doesn\u2019t reveal much about his views on the ACA, she said, noting that \u201cthe footnote was dropped in the very same case in which Judge Kavanaugh actually rejected an early major constitutional challenge to the ACA.\u201d\n\nSissel v. HHS, 2015. Schumer\u2019s July tweet included a graphic that cited this case, saying: \u201cJudge Kavanaugh argued that the D.C. Circuit Court should consider a claim that the ACA was unconstitutional. His fellow judges described it as a \u2018flawed\u2019 \u2018misread\u2019 of SCOTUS precedent.\u201d\n\nIn Sissel v. HHS, an Iowa artist named Matt Sissel argued that the Affordable Care Act was unconstitutional because it violated the origination clause of Article 1, which says that legislation that raises revenue must originate in the House of Representatives. The three-judge panel for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled against Sissel, and he requested the court reconsider the case en banc, meaning the full court would hear the case.\n\nThe appeals court again rejected the claim, saying, \u201cThe purpose of the ACA was to overhaul the national healthcare system, not to raise revenue.\u201d\n\nKavanaugh dissented, joined by three other judges. He said the ACA was indeed \u201ca revenue-raising bill subject to the Origination Clause.\u201d But, he said, the ACA complied with the clause. \u201cAlthough the original House bill was amended and its language replaced in the Senate, such Senate amendments are permissible under the Clause\u2019s text and precedent,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote.\n\nHe said he would grant the en banc hearing \u2014 so, Schumer is technically correct that Kavanaugh \u201cargued that the D.C. Circuit Court should consider a claim that the ACA was unconstitutional.\u201d But that ignores the fact that Kavanaugh went on to argue that the court should \u201crule for the Government on the ground that the Affordable Care Act originated in the House and thereby complied with the Origination Clause.\u201d\n\nThe court\u2019s opinion also did say that Kavanaugh\u2019s reading of Supreme Court precedent was \u201cflawed\u201d \u2014 but Kavanaugh, along with his fellow dissenters, described the panel opinion as \u201cflawed\u201d as well. The disagreement was over whether the origination clause applied in the case, not whether the ACA was constitutional.\n\nKavanaugh argued that not ruling on the case would raise constitutional questions about the origination clause and the balance of power between the House and the Senate.\n\nThe Harvard Law Review wrote of the case: \u201cSissel sends a very strong message regarding the constitutionality of the ACA under the Origination Clause. Even the four dissenting judges reached the conclusion that the ACA is constitutional, likely indicating unanimity across the D.C. Circuit.\u201d\n\nThe Texas case and preexisting conditions. As we wrote this summer, in their opposition to Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, Democrats have highlighted a case filed in District Court in Texas, and the Trump administration\u2019s decision to not defend the federal government in that case.\n\nThe Texas suit, filed by that state and 19 others, points to the Supreme Court\u2019s 2012 decision that the ACA\u2019s individual mandate to have health insurance was lawful under Congress\u2019 power to tax. Since Congress has now eliminated the tax penalty associated with the individual mandate (starting in tax year 2019), the suit argues, the mandate itself is unconstitutional. Without the mandate, the suit says, \u201cthe remainder of the ACA must also fall.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Justice has sided with the plaintiffs, but disagrees that the entire health care law must be eliminated. Instead, the DOJ said a finding that the mandate were unconstitutional would mean ACA preexisting condition provisions \u2014 provisions guaranteeing that those with medical conditions won\u2019t be denied coverage or charged more based on health status \u2014 would have to be eliminated as well.\n\nThe case has a long way to go before the Supreme Court would have any potential impact. It would need to make its way through the District Court in Texas, which began hearing oral arguments on Sept. 5, then through an appeals court and then to the Supreme Court.\n\nWhat Democrats are saying: \u201cAnd he would not uphold the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate,\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders claimed this summer.\n\nWhat Kavanaugh\u2019s record shows: Kavanaugh sided with religious organizations in a case challenging the ACA\u2019s requirement that insurance policies include coverage of birth control. There\u2019s some nuance, though, to this dissent as well.\n\nPriests for Life v. HHS, 2015. The plaintiff \u2014 a Catholic anti-abortion rights group \u2014 challenged the Obama administration\u2019s accommodation to the ACA\u2019s contraception mandate for religious employers. That accommodation, which pertained to nonprofits with religious affiliations and closely-held for-profit companies, said that women working for those groups could get contraception coverage paid for by the insurers, instead of their employers, if the employers notified the insurance companies or the Department of Health and Human Services of their religious objections.\n\nThe appeals court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a rehearing en banc. Kavanaugh dissented, saying he would \u201crule for the plaintiff religious organizations.\u201d But he also said that the Supreme Court ruling in the 2014 Hobby Lobby case \u201cstrongly suggests that the Government has a compelling interest in facilitating access to contraception for the employees of these religious organizations.\u201d However, Kavanaugh said, the accommodation for the religious groups \u201cis not the Government\u2019s least restrictive means of furthering its interest.\u201d\n\nJost, writing for the Commonwealth Fund, said that Kavanaugh acknowledged this \u201ccompelling interest\u201d and \u201cargued only that the government could have fulfilled that interest through an approach less restrictive of the rights of religious organizations.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these cases, Jost includes one on abortion and another on Medicare coverage in his full analysis, finding that \u201c[i]n none of these cases did Kavanaugh stake out a strong ideological position, for example, opposing abortion or the ACA. \u2026 This is not to say, however, that as a Supreme Court justice Kavanaugh might not effectuate major changes in law affecting controversial health policy issues.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
