The picture shows the Trump supporters lining up out of order, misspelling his name.\n\nThis image was doctored; in the original photo, the students stand in the correct order, spelling Trump\u2019s name properly.\n\nTrump, then a candidate vying to become president, spoke at Liberty University in January 2016. At that event, the five students posed for photos with the press. One of the images, posted to Facebook by CBC News photographer Meagan Fitzpatrick, shows the students standing in the correct order.\n\n\u201cA group of Liberty University students dressed for the occasion when Donald Trump spoke at their school on Jan. 18, 2016. They said they like that Trump is not afraid to offend people,\u201d the photo caption reads on the CBC website.\n\nHow do we know the students didn\u2019t pose in a different order moments earlier? The student posing in the middle of the group photo wearing white sneakers has an \u201cM\u201d on his shirt in the meme, but a \u201cU\u201d in the original photo.\n\nOther photos taken at the event show the letters in the right order as well. Whoever created the meme appears to have photoshopped the letters from one student to another.\n\nOne of the students featured in the image, Austin Miller, shared the same doctored photograph, this time posted by the Occupy Democrats Facebook page in March 2016, with the caption, \u201cTotally photoshopped but still kinda humorous. Haters gonna hate. Go Trump!\u201d", "lang": "en"}
