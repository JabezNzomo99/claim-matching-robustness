Let\u2019s try to check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: The video shows moving sand in the Allen Alkhai desert. Fact: The video is not that of a desert. It is Lake Nahuel Huapi (Argentina) which was filled with ash from the Puyehue volcano (Chile) in 2011. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nIn the comment section of the post, a user commented that the video was taken at the Lake Nahuel Huapi in Argentina when it was filled with volcano ash. But another user contradicted the claims made by the initial user.\n\nSo, when googled with the keywords \u2018Lake with ash\u2019, a \u2018Telegraph\u2019 news article published in 2011 with the same video can be found in the search results. In the article, the video has the following description, \u201cLake Nahuel Huapi in Argentina fills with ash from the Puyehue volcano that is erupting in neighbouring Chile.\u201d So, the video was not taken at the Allen Alkhai desert.\n\nTo sum it up, the video shows Lake Nahuel Huapi filled with volcanic ash. It is not Allen Alkhai desert.\n\nDid you watch the first Episode of DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
