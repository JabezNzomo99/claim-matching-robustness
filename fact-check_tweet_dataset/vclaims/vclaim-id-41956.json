Mitt Romney, R-Utah, do not work for Ukrainian gas companies. Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter did serve on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, but has not been accused of criminal conduct in connection with that position.\n\nAs to the first claim in the tweet, that from 1999 to 2014, \u201cUkraine donated more money to the Clinton Foundation than [did] any other foreign country,\u201d the source is an October 2019 story posted by the right-leaning website Lifezette, headlined \u201cUkraine Donated the Most Cash of Any Country to the Clinton Foundation.\u201d But the headline is misleading and not supported by the story itself.\n\n\n\nThe Lifezette story reported Ukraine donated \u201ca whopping $10 million to the Clinton Foundation\u201d but cites a chart published by The Wall Street Journal in March 2015 for that information. The chart doesn\u2019t record the amount of money donated by Ukraine government but rather the amount donated by individual donors by nationality. \n\n The Wall Street Journal story itself reported that the Clinton Foundation received millions of dollars in donations from individuals with ties to their respective governments, with the top donor in that time period being the charitable foundation of a former Ukraine parliamentarian:\n\nBetween 2009 and 2013, including when Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state, the Clinton Foundation received at least $8.6 million from the Victor Pinchuk Foundation, according to that foundation, which is based in Kiev, Ukraine. It was created by Mr. Pinchuk, whose fortune stems from a pipe-making company. He served two terms as an elected member of the Ukrainian Parliament and is a proponent of closer ties between Ukraine and the European Union. Mr. Pinchuk and his wife \u2014 the daughter of former Ukraine President Leonid Kuchma \u2014 began donating to Clinton charities in 2006 after being introduced to Mr. Clinton by Doug Schoen, a pollster who has worked for both Clintons. In 2008, Mr. Pinchuk made a five-year, $29 million commitment to the Clinton Global Initiative, a wing of the foundation that coordinates charitable projects and funding for them but doesn\u2019t handle the money. The pledge was to fund a program to train future Ukrainian leaders and professionals \u201cto modernize Ukraine,\u201d according to the Clinton Foundation. Several alumni are current members of the Ukrainian Parliament. Actual donations so far amount to only $1.8 million, a Pinchuk foundation spokesman said, citing the impact of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nAlthough the tweet from Educating Liberals did accurately note the time frame in which $10 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation were made by Ukrainian nationals, it left out important context from the 2015 news report published by The Wall Street Journal. That omission left the impression that the country of Ukraine, i.e. its federal government, donated $10 million to the Clinton Foundation.\n\nThe tweet from Educating Liberals was posted amid impeachment proceedings against Trump, which are based on allegations that he attempted to extort the Ukrainian president by withholding crucial military aid in order to acquire dirt from Ukraine on a political opponent. The tweet appeared to be an attempt to give the impression that Trump\u2019s political opponents have engaged in an equivalent quid pro quo scheme.", "lang": "en"}
