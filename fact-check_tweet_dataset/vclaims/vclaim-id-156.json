While soap can kill the virus on hands or surfaces, it can't be used the same way inside the body. A cure for the coronavirus does not yet exist, which is why it is important to take preventative measures like handwashing ( here ).\n\nThe Global Handwashing Partnership explains on its website how handwashing with soap destroys viruses such as the new coronavirus here .\n\nIn short, washing hands with soap and water protects people from spreading diseases and infections ( here ).\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) confirms that the novel coronavirus had not been seen before in humans. Although many trials are taking place, there is currently no treatment or vaccine for it ( here ).\n\nSoap is effective in killing the coronavirus as a preventative measure but this has little to do with the medical science behind finding and launching a vaccine or treatment.\n\nFalse: The fact that soap can destroy the coronavirus does not mean the disease must be easy to cure.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
