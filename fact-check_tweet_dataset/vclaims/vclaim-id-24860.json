The body reads: The last Islamic conference on \u201cpeace\u201d held in Abuja was just a front to flag off and open a new front on total jihad in Nigeria and to appoint Buhari as its supreme commander in our nation\u2019.\n\nThis post was also seen on Facebook.\n\nHowever, our findings show that this is FALSE. President Muhammadu Buhari did not receive such a flag and in fact, the story is not even new. We traced it to March 19, 2016 on the same Nairaland.com and subsequently on Biafrasay.com in July 14 the same year; a period when religious tensions where heightened in the country.\n\nEbere Agozie is a Senior Correspondent with the News Agency of Nigeria(NAN) with a staff strength of about 880, Joined in 2014 as a correspondent.
