The post is actually a replica of a parody published two days earlier.\n\nThe Facebook post falsely presenting the information as genuine was shared here on April 7, 2019, by a group that presents itself as critical of Duterte.\n\nThe post contains a photo of the president\u2019s son, Paolo \u201cPulong\u201d Duterte with an image of a chest X-ray in the background. Here is Paolo Duterte's official Facebook page.\n\nThe misleading post has been shared more than 170 times since it was published on a page with more than 19,000 followers.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe Tagalog language post translates to English as: \u201cJESUS MARY JOSEPH. DUTERTARDS are very much in awe again of Polong because he proved in an X-RAY that there is no dragon tattoo on Polong's back. HOLY! Is the TATTOO in his lungs that he need to have its X-RAY taken?\n\n\u201cDAVAO CITY, Philippines - So he can silence his critics, Pulong released to the media the x-ray of his back. It can be recalled that Senator Antonio Trillanes IV first dared \"Pulong\" Zimmerman Duterte, the former vice mayor of Davao city, to show his back so he can prove that he has no connections with the drug syndicates. But, after the video of alias \u201cBikoy\u201d spread, he was forced to appear in front of the media and show the x-ray of his back. 'Wow ha, you invent things ceaselessly. That's Black and white, there is no coloured dragon tattoo!' the President's eldest son said.\u201d\n\n\u201cDutertards\u201d is a derogatory term for Rodrigo Duterte supporters. This report by Philippine news site ABS-CBN News published on April 1, 2018, references the term.\n\n\u201cSenator Antonio Trillanes IV\u201d refers to Philippine senator Antonio \u201cSonny\u201d Trillanes IV. This is his official Facebook page.\n\nThe post claims Rodrigo Duterte supporters have been convinced that Paolo Duterte is not a member of a drug gang after he released an X-ray of himself in a bid to prove he did not have a tattoo on his back which connected him to a drug gang.\n\nIt references an allegation made by a Philippine lawmaker in 2017, who claimed Paolo Duterte had a dragon tattoo on his back, which the lawmaker said proved Duterte was a member of a drug gang. This is an AFP report published on September 7, 2017 about the allegations, which Paolo Duterte denied.\n\nThe Facebook account that posted the statement, named \u201cPepeng Makabayan\u201d, does not identify itself as a parody account. Its name translates to English as \u201cPepe the Patriotic\u201d.\n\nThe \u201cAbout\u201d section of its Facebook page translates to English as: \u201cShake the BRAINS of the 16M DUTERTARDS!\u201d\n\n\u201c16million\u201d refers to the votes cast for Rodrigo Duterte in 2016. This report published by CNN on May 30, 2016 states that he received 16,601,996 votes.\n\nAFP copied the text from the misleading post into Google\u2019s search engine, which led to this Facebook post on a parody page published on April 5, 2019. The parody page, entitled \u2018Don\u2019t Be Gullible Christian News\u2019 clearly identifies itself as a \u201creligious parody\u201d page.\n\nThe text in both posts is identical except for the first two sentences in the misleading post.\n\nThe photo used in the \u2018Don\u2019t Be Gullible Christian News\u2019 parody post, which shows Paolo Duterte and an X-ray, is also identical to the photo used in the misleading one.\n\nBelow is a screengrab of the misleading post (l) and the version on the parody page (r)\n\nComments on the Pepeng Makabayan post indicate that some Facebook users believed the post was true.\n\nOne user\u2019s post translates to English as: \u201cOh Lord,, He even went to have an x-ray,, when it's very easy to lift your shirt, you won't even have to spend a cent\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the comment:\n\nAnother comment states: \u201cOnly fools rush in. X-rays doesn\u2019t pick up soft tissues. My golly\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the comment:", "lang": "en"}
