Paul Gosar asks Capitol Police to arrest illegal immigrants attending State of the Union,\" stated the Jan. 30 headline on USA Trainnews, a right-leaning website.\n\nFacebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network\u2019s efforts to combat fake news. However, we found that the article correctly cites Gosar\u2019s efforts to summon law enforcement to arrest Dreamers.\n\nThe fate of Dreamers, which played a role in the January federal government shutdown, appears uncertain. In September, Trump announced that he was ending Obama\u2019s program that temporarily deferred deportation for certain illegal immigrants, prompting talks about how to come up with a permanent solution. A White House framework would offer a path to citizenship over 12 years in exchange for $25 billion for the border wall and other improvements, but members of both parties have raised objections.\n\nGosar, who was first elected to his Arizona district in 2010, received an A+ from NumbersUSA, a group that advocates for lower levels of immigration.\n\nGosar posted a few tweets from his U.S. House account at 1:33 p.m. Jan. 30, hours before Trump\u2019s State of the Union address:\n\n\"Today, Congressman Paul Gosar contacted the U.S. Capitol Police, as well as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, asking they consider checking identification of all attending the State of the Union address and arresting any illegal aliens in attendance.\n\n\"Additionally, Congressman Gosar asked that they arrest those using fraudulent social security numbers and identification to pass through security.\n\n\"Of all the places where the Rule of Law needs to be enforced, it should be in the hallowed halls of Congress. Any illegal aliens attempting to go through security, under any pretext of invitation or otherwise, should be arrested and deported.\"\n\nGosar\u2019s tweet drew criticism from members on both sides of the aisle on twitter.\n\n\"Oh my goodness, Rep. Gosar. Dreamers don't pose a threat to us,'' she tweeted. \"This is so drastic and cruel. Dios m\u00edo.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said that Ryan clearly does not agree\" with Gosar's suggestion.\n\nSenate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin tweeted: \"How many Republican members of the House and Senate will condemn this attempt to punish Dreamers who were brought to this country as kids?\"\n\nGosar\u2019s chief of staff Tom Van Flein told PolitiFact that Gosar spoke on the phone with the Capitol Police chief, but he didn\u2019t know how the police ultimately responded to Gosar\u2019s request.\n\nWe sent an email and left messages for spokespersons for the Capitol Police and the Justice Department and did not get a reply.\n\nUSA Trainnews wrote that \"Rep. Paul Gosar asks Capitol Police to arrest illegal immigrants attending State of the Union.\"\n\nGosar tweeted on Jan. 30 that he contacted police and Attorney General Jeff Sessions asking that they arrest any illegal immigrants attending the State of the Union.", "lang": "en"}
