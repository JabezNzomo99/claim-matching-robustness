Foster said the money was use-it-or-lose-it, while Ford said the plan takes money from the city\u2019s general funds.\n\n\"If we use (Tax Increment Financing) funding, that's going to take funds from the general fund for Pinellas County, as it will take funds from the general fund for the city of St. Pete,\" Ford said.\n\nWe decided to look into Ford's comments. (We'll look at Foster's in a separate fact-check.)\n\nLet\u2019s go back to 1969, when the Florida Legislature passed the Community Redevelopment Act. The intent was to allow a city and a county to target a specific geographic area -- say, a downtown -- for improvements. The law allows local officials to create a Community Redevelopment Area, so that a portion of property taxes collected in the area can be used for major development projects there.\n\nIn 1981, the city of St. Petersburg and Pinellas County set up such an area with the goal of paying for projects downtown. Each time the property taxes within the area rise above the 1981 level, that additional money goes into an improvement fund, usually called TIF, which stands for tax increment financing.\n\nWe should note that a pier project of some kind has long been on the drawing board. The inverted pyramid made in 1973 and underwent a major renovation in 1987. Since at least 2005, city officials have been looking at either another renovation or a total replacement, paid for with TIF money.\n\nCommunity Redevelopment Areas usually only last 30 years, and then the districts dissolve. But in 2005, the Board of County Commissioners granted the city a 30-year extension until 2035, said Ken Welch, a Pinellas County commissioner.\n\nFord\u2019s point is that if St. Petersburg\u2019s district didn\u2019t exist, the property tax money would go into the city and county\u2019s general funds.\n\nBut the district does exist, and that means TIF money is out of bounds for the city\u2019s day-to-day operations or anything outside the downtown district, said Joe Zeoli, managing director of administration and finance in city development.\n\nCity leaders have never supported abandoning the pier without a replacement, Zeoli said. Though Ford doesn\u2019t support the Lens design, she did advocate refurbishing the inverted pyramid at Tuesday\u2019s debate. Refurbishment money would likely come from the TIF fund.\n\nRight now there\u2019s about $50 million in TIF money available for a pier project, with about $37 million of that intended for construction. If the money isn\u2019t spent by 2035, only then could the county reclaim its 44 percent share. The city would take the remaining money.\n\nVoters will approve or reject the Lens on Aug. 27. If the Lens fails and a different pier project goes forward, the same method of financing would apply, Welch said.\n\nWhat had been coming from the general fund is a roughly $1.5 million subsidy for yearly operating costs for the now-closed inverted pyramid pier structure. The Lens would call for a $680,000 annual subsidy, as estimated by a third party, said Chris Ballestra, the city\u2019s managing director of development coordination.\n\n\"Any new project including a revamp of the inverted pyramid would likely reduce that $1.5 million burden,\" Ballestra said, not just the proposed Lens.\n\nIf the new structure makes the surrounding property more valuable, then taxes in that area would go up and feed back into the TIF fund, said David Cruz, Florida League of Cities legislative advocate.\n\nThe TIF money means no money for pier construction comes from general city funds. It doesn\u2019t raise people\u2019s tax bills, nor does it come from money the city is allowed to re-appropriate.\n\nFord said that TIF money takes away money from the city\u2019s general fund, implying that taxpayers would pay for the Lens with money that could be used elsewhere. Actually, the funds come from a special financing district, not from general funds. We rate her claim False.", "lang": "en"}
