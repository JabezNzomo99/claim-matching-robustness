BOOM found multiple instances where the organisation claimed to have found a cure for COVID-19, one of which is where Baba Ramdev calls the medicine a cure.\n\nAcharya Balkrishna was reported to have said that the organisation did not claim that their medicine- Corona kit can cure or control coronavirus but stated that they had made medicines and used them in clinically controlled trials which cured corona patients.\n\nIn another interview to Amar Ujala, Balkrishna went on to say that neither did they advertise the product, nor did they give it in newspapers that the product cures COVID-19. He further elaborated that they only shared results of a trial that they had conducted.

On June 23, during the launch, Patanjali founder and yoga guru Ramkrishna Yadav better known as Baba Ramdev repeatedly stated that their medicine was a cure for Corona. He mentioned that Corona patients had a 100% recovery rate from COVID-19 in three days after consuming their medicine.\n\nThe AYUSH ministry had then asked the organisation to share its research documents while the Uttarakhand State Licensing Authority clarified that they did not license the product as a potential cure for COVID-19.\n\nBOOM found six different instances of Baba Ramdev, Acharya Balkrishna, and Patanjali spokesman SK Tijarawala claiming that Patanjali has created a medicine specially for COVID-19\n\n\"This is Not Only Control, Cure Hai\": Ramdev\n\nBOOM accessed the video of the press conference from June 23 held in Patanjali Yogapeeth , Haridwar.
