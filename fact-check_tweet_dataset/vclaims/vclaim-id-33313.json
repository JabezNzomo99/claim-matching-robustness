The video is actually footage of a volcano erupting in Guatemala in June 2018.\n\nThe 30-second video, which seems to be taken from a moving vehicle, shows a massive ash cloud spewing into the sky.\n\nThe October 3 post says: \u201cMount Soputan in North Sulawesi erupted at 8.47 am local time. Let\u2019s pray for the safety of our brothers and sisters there.\u201d\n\nThe Facebook post was shared more than 2,500 times.\n\nThe same video footage can be seen in this Al Jazeera article dated June 4, 2018 and this YouTube video from Univision Noticias on the same date, the day after Fuego volcano erupted in Guatemala.\n\nMount Soputan, situated around 1,000 kilometres (600 miles) from the tsunami-ravaged town of Palu, did erupt on October 3, spewing volcanic ash 4,000 metres into the air, as seen in this AFP-sourced photo.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s disaster mitigation agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in an October 3 tweet that the video in question did not show the Soputan eruption.\n\n\"This video does not show Mount Soputan erupting. This is a volcano eruption in South America. If any reports say this video is of Mount Soputan, that must be a hoax. Please ignore and don't spread it on social media,\" he said.", "lang": "en"}
