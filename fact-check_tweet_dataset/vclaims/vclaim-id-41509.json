Also, Ghana is not on the U.S. State Department\u2019s Visa Waiver Program list.\n\nA story published on a website called [email protected] on April 3, 2019, has generated some excitement among travel hopefuls. With the headline \u201cBREAKING NEWS: U.S is now Visa-free for Ghanaians without criminal records; stay of no more than 30 days allowed\u201d, the story claims that \u201cholders of Ghanaian passport without criminal records are entitled to visit the U.S. without visas for a period of 30 days only.\u201d\n\nIt cited a \u201cSatirist Attachee at the embassy,\u201d a portfolio which sounds dubious, as saying the only documents Ghanaians need to travel to the United States (U.S.) are a valid passport and police clearance certificate.\n\nThe story was sourced almost verbatim by other online platforms who missed the caution on the \u201cdisclaimer and who we are\u201d section of News @ 7 that it is a \u201csatirical website\u2019 which should not be relied on for news unless otherwise indicated.\n\nIt has received 964 retweets, 991 likes and 136 comments on Twitter with some users urging their respective countries to emulate Ghana in order to enjoy the same privilege. The interest generated by the story is understandable considering the number of would-be travellers who are refused visas every day across Africa.\n\nUnfortunately, the United States Embassy in Ghana in a tweet has debunked the story. It further directed persons seeking to travel to the U.S. to visit their website for accurate and up-to-date information about US visas.\n\nThis is not the first time such news is being circulated. In 2017, the US Embassy in a tweet refuted reports of visa policy change for Ghanaians following claims on some websites that President Donald Trump had signed an executive order allowing Ghanaians to travel to the U.S without visas.\n\nWHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR A VISA-FREE US ENTRY?\n\nThe U.S. Department of State lists countries whose citizens can travel to the U.S. without visas under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) on its website. Under the program, citizens from 38 countries can travel to the U.S. for not more than 90 days without a visa if they meet certain requirements. Ghana is NOT on the list. A country must meet the visa refusal rate (that is how often the U.S. refuses a visa request) of less than 3 per cent among other requirements to qualify. This may however not happen anytime soon for Ghana considering its current visa refusal rate of 49.35 per cent, an improvement on a refusal rate of 65.7 per cent in 2016.\n\nNews @ 7, a \u201csatirical website\u201d reported that Ghanaians without criminal records could travel to the U.S. without a visa. The story was widely circulated with other websites sourcing it almost verbatim. The U.S. Embassy in Ghana has denied the report and has directed persons aspiring to travel to its website for accurate information. Also, Ghana is not on the U.S. State Department\u2019s Visa Waiver Program list!", "lang": "en"}
