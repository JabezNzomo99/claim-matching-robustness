The image being remarked upon, however, was digitally manipulated to add the words \u201ckilling all\u201d to the phrasing. The original sign simply read: \u201cEnding White Supremacy Starts with White People\u201d (with no mention of killing anyone).\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the original photograph (left) and the doctored image (right):\n\nThe original photograph has been online since August 2017 and was most likely taken at a counter-protest to the \u201cUnite The Right Rally,\u201d a white supremacist event held in Charlottesville, Virginia, that resulted in the death of one person. The pictured protester was urging \u201cwhite people\u201d to do their part in ending racism, similar to a number of other protest signs seen at the rally, including one in the background of this photograph which reads \u201cWhite America: It\u2019s on us. Fight White Supremacism.\u201d\n\n<!\u2013\n\n Although the notion of a \"white genocide\u201d has been a major talking point of the alt-right, white nationalist, and neo-Nazi communities for a number of years, President Trump helped put this idea into the mainstream when he tweeted about the \u201clarge scale killing\u201d of farmers in South Africa in August 2018:\n\nThe idea that there is a \u2018genocide\u2019 of white farmers in South Africa was once the province of conspiracy theorists but, thanks to News Corp\u2019s media promotion, it has moved into the policy realm. On Wednesday night, the Fox News presenter Tucker Carlson once again talked about the alleged plight of white South African farmers on his Fox News program. On Twitter, Donald Trump indicated that he had been watching. The president\u2019s tweet called for further study, but treated the \u201clarge scale killing of farmers\u201d as a settled fact, when reporting indicates that against the background of a generally high murder rate in South Africa, there is no evidence of white farmers being specifically targeted. But Trump\u2019s tweet came at the end of a long process whereby the far-right idea of \u201cwhite genocide\u201d in South Africa had been mainstreamed, working its way from far-right websites and forums, into the rightward edge of mainstream media, and then into policy proposals. News Corp outlets have played an outsized role in that process. The conspiracy theory of \u201cwhite genocide\u201d has been a staple of the racist far right for decades. It has taken many forms, but all of them imagine that there is a plot to either replace, remove or simply liquidate white populations.\n\nIt appears that the words \u201ckilling all\u201d were added to this image just a few days after President Trump posted this tweet.\n\n \u2013>", "lang": "en"}
