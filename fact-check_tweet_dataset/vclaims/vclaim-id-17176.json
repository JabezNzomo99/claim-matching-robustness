The post claims that the message has been received from Dahisar senior police inspector Ramkant Patil.\n\nIndia Today\u2019s Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA), however, has found it to be a hoax. In fact, there is no officer by the name of Ramkant Patil posted at Dahisar police station.\n\nOn June 24, Facebook user Pooja Mehta uploaded a post that says, A group of 15-20 people, including women and children, are active between Malad and Dahisar. They are armed. Please do not open the door at night or any other time if you hear a baby crying outside.\n\nThe archived version of this post can be seen here.\n\nOther Facebook users have shared the post along with videos. One such post by Arpan Kothari shows CCTV footage and a press conference by a police officer. While the CCTV footage shows a few men and women talking and climbing the stairs of a building, the police officer speaks about some arrests. The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nFacebook user Jigna Dhanak uploaded another video containing CCTV footage different from the earlier video. This post too had the same claim of the message being forwarded by Ramkant Patil. CCTV footage in this video shows a woman being attacked by a man.\n\nAFWA searched the Internet to find incidents in Malad or Dahisar where a group of 15-20 armed people, including women, robbed houses using crying children as baits. But we could not find even one such incident.\n\nAFWA then looked through the website of Mumbai police. There is a list of senior police inspectors in charge of every police station. The name of senior police inspector of Dahisar police station is Vasant Narayan Pingle.\n\nAFWA spoke to Pingle who said, This post has been viral for the last one-and-a-half years. People keep asking me and I keep telling them it\u2019s fake. I have been posted in Dahisar police station since August 4, 2017. Before me, there was an officer named Subhash Sawant in my position. He was here for one-and-a-half years. Before him, another officer named Prakash Jadhav served here for two years in this position. No one here has heard of a senior police inspector named Ramkant Patil in several years.\n\nAFWA also checked the videos that have been posted along with the viral claims. The post with CCTV footage and press conference by a police officer is actually about an incident unrelated to the viral claim.\n\nDahisar police had arrested 13 people, including two women, who had raided the house of a real estate agent by posing as income tax officers. News about the incident can be seen here.\n\nCCTV footage in the other post shows a man following a woman into a building lift and subsequently attacking her when she tries to get out. Neighbours come to the rescue of the woman and the attacker is caught. This clearly has nothing to do with the viral claim of a group of 15-20 people robbing a house with weapons.", "lang": "en"}
