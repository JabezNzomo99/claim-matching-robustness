The article opened:\n\nSan Mateo, CA | A Californian man is being treated at the San Mateo Medical Center after his boyfriend's fist was stuck for a painstaking 14 hours in his own rectum. The couple who were allegedly practicing \"fisting,\" a sexual activity that involves inserting a hand into the partner's rectum, called 9-1-1 after they were unable to release the man's hand from his boyfriend's anal cavity. Both men were transported by ambulance to San Mateo Medical Center where hospital staff successfully released the man's hand only 14 hours later, a complicated task due to heavy inflammation, blood loss and risk of laceration, say doctors. \"I know I'll never have the opportunity to give birth in my lifetime, but I think I know what it feels like now\" Mathew Cunning, 23, told reporters. \"I just talked to my mom on the phone and she told me she had felt the same thing when she was in labor,\" he admitted.\n\nThe story is entirely fictional and there is no truth to it at all. The photo that was used to illustrate the story actually shows David Priestman, a 35-year old Manchester man who gave up his own hospital bed to victims of the May 2017 terror attack on an Ariana Grande concert in which 23 people were killed and over 500 injured. Priestman was recovering from surgery but discharged himself from hospital in order to be able to do something to help.\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known hoax website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories.
