The organisers claimed that an estimated 670,000 people marched, and we\u2019ve been asked by readers to check this claim.\n\nThe reality is that it\u2019s really hard to accurately measure crowd sizes at non-ticketed events. That said, our crude estimate is that, based on available evidence, it looked like around 450,000 people were present at the start of the march.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t account for people outside the official march route, or who joined along the route or to hear speeches at the end.\n\nThat means we can\u2019t say that 670,000 is wrong as an estimate, although from what organisers have told us about how they came up with their estimate, we suspect it might be on the high side.\n\nWe\u2019ve asked experts in crowd science at Manchester Metropolitan University to help us estimate the size of the crowd, and will update this piece when we hear back.\n\nHow did we make our estimate?\n\nLooking at overhead imagery is a common way to estimate the size of a crowd, but one of the problems with marches is that they\u2019re fluid, and not necessarily consistent in density throughout.\n\nLuckily in this case, we were helped by the fact that the start of the march was delayed, so the main mass of marchers were all gathered in a space from Marble Arch down Park Lane and south to Wellington Arch.\n\nWe then digitally sketched that area out and found it covered roughly 100,000m\u00b2. The aerial imagery showed people packed in very tightly at points, but sparsely at others, and some areas were altogether inaccessible. Therefore we estimated that the area was occupied on average by 3 people per square metre , giving an estimate of 300,000. These images indicate what that might look like:\n\n\n\nAlso, helicopter imagery shows that more marchers gathered along Piccadilly and St James\u2019s Street when the march started, or just after. While Piccadilly appears very tightly packed, St James\u2019s Street was much sparser.\n\nWe don\u2019t have footage of the rest of the route that early in the march (although we can see what areas like Trafalgar Square and Whitehall looked like about half an hour in). Based on all that footage, we estimate that the route past Park Lane up to Parliament Square was occupied by, on average, 2 people per square metre at the start of the march.\n\nAdding those tightly packed people at Park Lane to the less tightly packed people on the rest of the route, we estimate that around 450,000 marchers may have been on the streets at the start of the march.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean we think the 670,000 estimate is necessarily wrong though. The organisers told us that people also gathered outside the official route.\n\nAlso, regardless of how many people were in attendance when the march started at 1.23pm, it\u2019s plausible that more joined further along the route, or just at Parliament Square for the closing speeches.\n\nWe do disagree with the People\u2019s Vote methodology in some respects\n\nThough we can\u2019t say that the 670,000 figure is incorrect, there are parts of the People\u2019s Vote estimation methodology we do disagree with. We\u2019ve largely followed the same approach as them, but think they may have somewhat overestimated the density of the march.\n\nThey told us that at the start of the march Park Lane and Piccadilly were packed at 4 people per square metre which seems unlikely given the large free areas, especially along Piccadilly, observed at the start of the march.\n\nThey also said that at around 1.30pm Trafalgar Square was completely packed with people, when footage from roughly 1.45 suggests this wasn\u2019t the case.\n\nSo overall, an estimate of 670,000 is possibly on the high side.\n\nWhy is it difficult to measure crowds?\n\nWithout data like ticket sales or turnstile counts, measuring crowds relies on rough estimates.\n\nOne common method for estimating the number is called the Jacobs method. You simply divide a crowd area into sections, determine the average number of people in a section, and then scale that up. That\u2019s provided you have good enough aerial images to show the size and density of a crowd.\n\nIdeally to estimate a crowd using the Jacobs method, you\u2019d have high quality aerial images of the entire crowd, which unfortunately are not available for the People\u2019s March.\n\nEven with these, the Jacobs method isn\u2019t perfect for various reasons. You can never be sure if the average number of people per section you\u2019ve used is representative of the whole crowd (i.e. it could be much denser or much less dense than the crowd average).\n\nAnd the method assumes that people are static which isn\u2019t that helpful when measuring crowds at marches, like the one on Saturday, because people aren\u2019t necessarily all in the same place at the same time.", "lang": "en"}
