The posts claim that the warning comes from the City of London Police fraud team.\n\nThe messages have been shared on social media, private messaging apps and via SMS, according to Action Fraud, the UK\u2019s national reporting centre for fraud run by the City of London Police (here). Action Fraud states that the content of the message is false.\n\nThe posts on Facebook have slight differences in wording, but many reference the City of London Police fraud team. The posts warn that Danske Bank customers are being targeted by a text message scam resulting in \u201cthousands\u201d of pounds being taken from people\u2019s accounts. The messages encourage others to \u201cspread the word\u201d.\n\nDanske Bank commented on the rumour on March 26, sharing a screenshot of a message that it described as being shared on WhatsApp, text and social media (here). The version the bank shared included text that suggested the warning came via a call centre manager rather than the City of London Police. Danske Bank warned customers in the same post that this type of SMS-based scam, referred to as \u2018smishing\u2019, is very common. The bank advised customers that they should not click a link in a message asking for \u201cpersonal information under the pretence of needing to make a payment\u201d (here).\n\nFalse: rumours of a messaging scam specifically targeting customers of Danske Bank are false.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
