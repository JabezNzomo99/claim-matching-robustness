The Bhim Army chief himself mocked the claim on Twitter and wrote, \u201c\u091c\u092c\u0938\u0947 \u092f\u0947 \u092a\u094b\u0938\u094d\u091f \u092a\u0922\u093c\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u092e\u0947\u0930\u0940 \u0924\u094b \u0939\u0902\u0938\u0940 \u0928\u0939\u0940 \u0930\u0941\u0915 \u0930\u0939\u0940 \u0939\u0948\u0964 \u0935\u0948\u0938\u0947 \u0928\u0938\u0940\u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0926\u0940\u0928 \u0928\u093e\u092e \u092c\u0941\u0930\u093e \u0928\u0939\u0940 \u0939\u0948 (I cannot stop laughing since I came across this post. By the way, Naseeruddin isn\u2019t a bad name.)\u201d\n\nAzad has built his politics around his Dalit identity \u2013 a fact known to all. According to several media reports, he hails from Chutmalpur, a small town situated near Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh. He is the son of late Govardhan Das who was a retired government school principal. In a 2017 interview with The Quint, Azad talked about how his father was insulted in the school due to his \u2018chamar\u2019 identity. The \u2018chamar\u2019 community is regarded as \u2018Dalits\u2019 or \u2018untouchables\u2019, however, they officially fall into the scheduled caste category.\n\nChandrashekhar Azad has been targetted with misinformation in the past well when Zee News and News18 misquoted the Dalit leader.", "lang": "en"}
