He also added that the patients have not shown any symptoms. \n\n\n\nAlso Read: No, Thane Thyrocare Lab Is Not Sealed Over False Positive COVID-19 Tests\n\nA Tripura-based news portal, Tripurainfoway, and Zee News Hindi also reported on the incident. The video was also uploaded by Tripurainfoway on YouTube.\n\nAn examination of the videos being shared with the NSCI centre claims and the videos from the Agartala centre shows they are from the same place.\n\nIn the videos, two men can be identified by their clothes. A man wearing a blue vest with a read seam, camouflage shorts and a red cloth tied on his neck can be seen in both the videos. Another man wearing a light blue t-shirt and checked shorts can also be seen.\n\nIn a tweet on June 4, Tripura CM Biplab Deb posted images of the quarantine centre at Hapania Exhibition Hall.\n\nBOOM identified two visual markers in the videos and in the images shared by Deb. A vent with holes and an orange wall can be clearly seen in the videos.\n\nThe two men as well as the physical markers can also be seen in this video which BOOM received on its WhatsApp helpline.\n\nA video of quarantined patients sharing their thoughts of dancing was also later viral. An unidentified patient in this video, can be heard saying \"We are in the center for some time. We have been trying to make it interesting by engaging in some music and dance. People who are outside (the centre) are commenting about us dancing. But they should know that we are under tremendous mental pressure and we need to unwind as well.\"\n\nMumbai has been one of the worst-affected cities in India by COVID-19. As of June 12, 55,357 people have tested positive for COVID-19 and 2,042 have died in Mumbai so far.", "lang": "en"}
