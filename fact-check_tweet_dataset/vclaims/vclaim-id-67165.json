The man in the video can be seen speaking against certain politicians and journalists. It begins with his criticism of the Congress party and ends with him demanding that a total of 100 people be sent to jail.\n\nThe same video was also widespread earlier in August.\n\nWe found that this video has been viral with the same claim on Twitter since July.\n\nThis video cannot possibly show \u201cCongress MLA Anil Upadhyay\u201d because there is no such MLA by this name. This is a fictitious name that goes viral every few months with a new video. Alt News has investigated many such videos with this name.\n\n1. Fictional BJP MLA \u2018Anil Upadhyay\u2019 revived, now with false claim that he was thrashed by women\n\n2. BJP MLA \u2018Anil Upadhyaya\u2019 talking about CAA? No, videos yet again viral with fictitious name\n\nIn the screenshot below, the search results of the name \u2018Anil Upadhyay\u2019 on myneta.info is shown. This website is a database of contesting political candidates. As evident, there is no Congress politician named \u201cAnil Upadhyay\u201d.\n\nNow, let\u2019s find out who is the person in the video. On the bottom of the clip, the words \u2018The Newspaper Exclusive\u2019 can be seen.\n\nWe found a verified channel called \u2018The Newspaper\u2019 on YouTube that has more than 5 lakh subscribers. However, its social media accounts on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are not verified and have a much smaller follower count. The channel uploaded this 11-minute video of a professor on March 4, 2020. The video is entitled, \u201cWhat did this professor say about Rahul Gandhi that made people lift him up in the air? | Delhi.\u201d\n\nIn this video, the person seen talking for eight minutes is the same one from the video going viral but his name is not mentioned anywhere in the video. We contacted \u2018The Newspaper\u2019 and tried to find out who he was. We were told that his name is Vinay Kumar Singh. Singh is from Delhi who had contested elections from the Janashakti Party (Rashtriya).\n\nWhen we looked for him on myneta.info, we discovered that he had contested elections from Patparganj on a Janshakti Party (Rashtriya) ticket in the recent Delhi Assembly Elections of 2020. The entry also has a photo of him along with other information and affidavits on the Election Commission of India website.\n\nTherefore, Delhi-based Janshakti Party (Rashtriya) leader Vinay Kumar Singh is being misidentified in this viral video as fictional Congress leader Anil Upadhyay.", "lang": "en"}
