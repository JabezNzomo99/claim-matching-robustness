This is misleading and false.\n\nExamples can be seen ( here ) and ( here ) .\n\nMost iterations of this claim link to a YouTube video clip of Winfrey that is low resolution and overlaid with emojis and text.\n\nThe original video, from which the clip is taken, is an interview called \u201cOprah Winfrey Presents: After Neverland\u201d about the documentary \u201cLeaving Neverland\u201d that aired in 2019. In the video, Winfrey is interviewing Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who were subjects of the documentary, and Dan Reed, the director. ( here )\n\n\u201cLeaving Neverland\u201d, in which two adult men say they were befriended by Jackson and were abused by him from the ages of seven and 10 in the early 1990s, was met with a mixture of horror and disbelief by audiences after a two-part airing on U.S. cable channel HBO ( here, here ).\n\nWinfrey\u2019s words have been taken out of context in the short video that is the subject of this check, and the video is misleadingly headlined to suggest she is condoning or promoting sexual abuse. The video singles out a two-minute section out of the original, almost hour-long interview, in which Winfrey talks about the topic of grooming.\n\nThe clip has also been edited together, leaving out a dialogue exchange between Winfrey and her guests. The original interview can be viewed on HBO, starting around 31 minutes in. ( bit.ly/3bqYakm )\n\nThe title of the short video reads \u201cOPRAH SAYS \u2018IT FEELS GOOD TO BE MOLESTED AS A CHILD\u2019 & IF DONE RIGHT THE CHILD SHOULDN\u2019T REMEMBER\u201d. This is false. Oprah does not say this in the original video.\n\nWinfrey talks about how an abuser can be someone that the victim knows personally and loves or admires. By gaining a victim\u2019s trust, she says, the victim might not be aware of the abuse, and that abuse may in some circumstances feel good to the victim in that moment. She goes on to explain that this is \u201cone of the reasons it\u2019s so confusing for children\u201d.\n\nWinfrey, herself a sexual assault survivor, has been open about her own years-long experiences of abuse when she was a child. ( here ). In an interview with PEOPLE in 2018 she said: \u201cIt happened to me at 9, and then 10, and then 11, and then 12, 13, 14. You don\u2019t have the language to begin to explain what\u2019s happening to you. That\u2019s why you feel you\u2019re not going to be believed. And if the abuser, the molester, is any good, they will make you feel that you are complicit, that you were part of it. That\u2019s what keeps you from telling.\u201d\n\nShe told the story for the first time in 1989 on the Oprah Winfrey Show ( here ).\n\nFalse. This video has been edited, taken out of context and given a misleading headline. In the HBO interview from which the clips were taken, Oprah Winfrey was not condoning child sexual abuse but discussing grooming and dynamics that can arise in situations of abuse.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
