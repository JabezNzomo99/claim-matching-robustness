Mr Hunt\u2019s proposal cuts that further to 12.5%, meaning the UK will remain having one of the lowest such tax rates in the OECD group of rich countries.\n\nBut the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) is clear that \u201cThis is not a tax cut that would pay for itself\u201d.\n\nThe exact impacts on economic growth are hard to predict, but as an example, in 2013 HMRC estimated that cutting the rate from 28% to 20% (between 2010 and 2016)\u2014along with other smaller changes\u2014could increase GDP by 0.6-0.8% after 20 years.\n\nCutting corporation tax obviously has the direct impact of reducing the amount that businesses have to pay in tax and so reduces the amount that the Treasury gets in tax receipts. The IFS estimates Mr Hunt\u2019s cut would reduce the amount of tax collected by \u00a313 billion in the short-run.\n\nBut it\u2019s also argued that, indirectly, this can encourage investment and business growth, which means either more companies paying tax in the first place or higher economic growth. If higher growth leads to higher employment and higher wages, that increases what the government gets in other forms of tax.\n\nPutting numbers on how big those effects are is difficult, especially given that the indirect impacts would play out over several years, and that naturally leads to greater uncertainty.\n\nGiven the indirect effects, the cut probably won\u2019t cost as much as \u00a313 billion in the long run, according to the IFS. But it also says that \u201cOne thing we can be fairly sure of is that a cut of this magnitude would not pay for itself\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is implausible to believe that profits earned or recorded in the UK could increase by enough to make up for the immediate \u00a313 billion fall in revenue\u201d.\n\nIf the Irish can do it, why can\u2019t we?\n\nJeremy Hunt mentions the example of Ireland, which in 2015 cut its corporation tax rate substantially and in turn saw a large increase in the size of its economy (measured by GDP).\n\nAccording to the OECD, Ireland\u2019s economy grew by a massive 25% that year and continued to grow relatively strongly in the following years (though nowhere near 25%). The clear implication of Mr Hunt\u2019s claim is that the UK could also see an uptick in growth with a more competitive rate.\n\nThe IFS isn\u2019t so sure, and points out that the Irish case is quite different to that of the UK. \u201cThe difference is that prior to that decision very little was raised in corporate tax revenue as few big and profitable corporations were headquartered there, so there was little to lose and much to gain. The UK has far more tax revenue to lose in the first place.\u201d\n\nIt has also pointed out that while the UK would have a competitive main rate of corporation tax, other factors make the UK less competitive, such as relatively ungenerous capital allowances.\n\nIn addition, the Irish Central Statistics Office cautioned that the huge uptick in growth in 2015 was \u201clargely related to relocation of multinational companies to Ireland, which had a limited impact on the underlying Irish economy\u201d.\n\nMr Hunt specifically mentions that Ireland moved from having a lower GDP per head than the UK to one that was 50% higher.\n\nThis is incorrect: we\u2019ve seen no measure of GDP per head that suggests this. Several measures show Ireland had a higher GDP per head than the UK in recent years even before its tax changes and that the difference grew larger (some suggest more than 50%) since 2015.", "lang": "en"}
