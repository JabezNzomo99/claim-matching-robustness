The footage was broadcasted by TV9 Bharatvarsh as the Modi and Singh meeting at the latter\u2019s residence to discuss India\u2019s economy. In the broadcast, the anchor also spoke with Supriya Bhardwaj, a journalist associated with the channel. The reporter claimed that according to sources, it was a courtesy meeting where subjects related to the economy were discussed. However, TV9 Bharatvarsh later deleted their broadcast video from YouTube, after their faux-pas was highlighted by an individual named Ankur Singh. TV9 Bharatvarsh has yet not issued a clarification for the same.\n\nDabang News, a local media organization from Madhya Pradesh, had also published the video on YouTube with a similar narrative.\n\nKhusboo Bhagat, a Twitter user, who claims to be the National Delegate of NSUI, also posted the video with the same narrative that Modi met Singh to discuss GDP.\n\nBhagat\u2019s tweet was quote-tweeted by Lavanya Ballal, the state spokesperson of Karnataka Congress.\n\nUmpteen users have shared the video with an identical narrative on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nA simple keyword search on Google reveals that the video pertains to a meeting dating back to May 27, 2014, a day after Narendra Modi took oath as the Prime Minister of India. The original video was also posted on Narendra Modi\u2019s official YouTube channel. At the time, The Indian Express reported, \u201cIn a special gesture, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday visited his predecessor Manmohan Singh to make a courtesy call.\u201d\n\nIt is noteworthy that the newly appointed Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently met Dr Manmohan Singh. There are no news reports claiming that a meeting also took place between Dr Singh and the PM Modi. It is unlikely that such a meeting held by the Prime Minister of India goes unnoticed in the media.\n\nAn old video of a courtesy-call meeting, which took place in 2014, was circulated on social media and published by a mainstream media outlet as recent.", "lang": "en"}
