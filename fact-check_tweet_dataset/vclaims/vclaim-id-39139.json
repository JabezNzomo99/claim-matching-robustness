This is misleading; experts and health agencies say there is not enough research on the virus to make these specific claims.\n\nThe posts -- which have been distributed by various users copying and pasting it -- is made up of 14 points on the novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, all allegedly provided by the uncle of a friend \u201cwho worked in Shenzhen Hospital (Guangdong Province, China).\u201d\n\nThe post has been shared in Canada, the United States and Britain, but several of the claims it makes are inaccurate.\n\nThe Facebook posts warn readers that having a runny nose and sputum means the patient has a common cold, while the novel coronavirus manifests itself as pneumonia featuring a dry cough and no runny nose. This is false.\n\nBrandon Brown, a professor at the University of California Riverside\u2019s Center for Healthy Communities, told AFP by email that the novel coronavirus \u201ccan cause a runny nose and sputum,\u201d because \u201c\u2018the symptoms are first similar to a common cold.\u201d\n\nThe misleading posts also describe novel coronavirus symptoms as chronological, with a throat infection as the first symptom, lasting three to four days, followed by pneumonia lasting five to six days.\n\nSymptoms of the novel coronavirus, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties.\n\nHealth Canada also said that certain patients may have little to no symptoms, and people may not know if they have symptoms of the virus \u201cbecause they are similar to a cold or a flu.\u201d\n\nVirus resilience on various surfaces and temperatures\n\nAccording to the post, the novel coronavirus dies at temperatures above 26/27 degrees, but it can survive for five to 10 minutes on someone\u2019s hand, six to 12 hours on fabric, and 12 hours on metal.\n\nResearch is still underway to understand the resillance of the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe CDC states on its novel coronavirus information page: \u201cIt is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization also states in an informational note that \u201cThe new coronavirus can stay on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days (depending on the type of surface).\u201d\n\nA US government funded study published on March 17, 2020 in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease had similar levels of viability outside the body to its predecessor that caused SARS.\n\nAFP reported that the new coronavirus was detectable for up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel, and for up to 24 hours on cardboard.\n\nThe posts also claim that \u201cdrinking warm water is effective for all viruses,\u201d say people should avoid drinking water with ice, and advise drinking plenty of water in general.\n\nWater temperature is not a factor when it comes to hydration. Brown told AFP that there is \u201cno need to change the temperature of your drinking water,\u201d while adding that, \u201cdrinking water is always important, not just for coronavirus prevention.\u201d\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked several posts claiming harm or benefit from drinking water at a certain temperature.\n\nRegarding the advice to gargle with warm salt water, Brown answered that it is a common remedy for sore throat in general, not for the novel coronavirus in particular.\n\nVariants of the post cite internal memos from Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and Stanford Hospital in California as the source.\n\nOn March 12, 2020, Stanford Health Care published a statement on Facebook in which they denied any affiliation with the viral post and its content.\n\nA variant of the posts appears in WhatsApp messages that make nearly identical claims, attributing them to UNICEF, the UN\u2019s children\u2019s agency.\n\nChristopher Tidey, a spokesman for UNICEF, told AFP in an email that it did not send out such a message.\n\n\u201cThat post is NOT from UNICEF and it is not accurate,\u201d Tidey said.\n\nTidey warned that misinformation on the novel coronavirus can be dangerous: \u201cIt can spread paranoia, fear, and stigmatization, and have other consequences like offering a false sense of protection.\u201d\n\nInstead, UNICEF recommends washing hands frequently, covering one\u2019s mouth when coughing and sneezing, avoiding close contact with anyone showing cold or flu-like symptoms, and seeking medical care early when developing a fever, cough, or difficulty breathing.\n\nThe alleged UNICEF posts claim that the coronavirus has a cell diameter of 400-500 micrometers (0.4-0.5 millimeters), \u201cso any mask prevents its entry.\u201d This is also false.\n\nNovel coronavirus particles have a diameter ranging between 60 and 140 nanometers (0.06-0.14 micrometers), according to a February 2020 report published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Chinese researchers.\n\nFor health professionals working with potentially infected patients, the CDC recommends wearing N95 respirators rather than facemasks when possible.\n\nFor the general population, the CDC \u201cdoes not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19.\u201d The WHO says that for those without symptoms, \u201cthere is no need to wear a mask.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), 72 cases had been confirmed in Canada as of March 9, 2020, and one death was reported in the country. In the US, the CDC reported 423 cases and 19 deaths on March 9.\n\nCanadians can consult this page from the PHAC for more information on the virus\u2019 progression in the country.
