Many an older generation who had come as grandparents. Census 2011.\u201d\n\nThe figures given in the Casey review are correct. Leaving aside those under 16, a total of 768,000 people in England reported that they couldn\u2019t speak English well or at all at the 2011 census.\n\nMr Travis\u2019s figures refer to England and Wales, and are also correct.\n\nIn the last census, about 0.3% of the population of England and Wales aged three or over reported that they spoke no English or Welsh.\n\nNot all 138,000 of those people were immigrants. 118,000 people born outside the UK spoke no English or Welsh. The rest of the group was born inside the UK and included, for example, people whose main language was a was a sign language.\n\nAnother 726,000 people said that they spoke either English or Welsh but not well, making up another 1.3% of the population. 687,000 of them had been born outside the UK.\n\nSo overall, about 1.6% of the population said they didn\u2019t speak either English or Welsh well or at all.\n\nIt\u2019s also true that older immigrants were less likely to speak either English or Welsh well\n\nAbout half of people born outside the UK had a first language that wasn\u2019t English (or Welsh).\n\n59% of non-English speakers who arrived after they turned 50 said that they didn't speak English well or at all, compared to 20% of those who arrived before the age of 50.\n\nAbout 23% of non-English speakers who arrived after the age of 50 said that they spoke no English at all, compared to just 2.4% of those who arrived before.\n\nBut older immigrants make up a fairly small proportion of non-English speaking immigrants\n\nAlthough older immigrants make up a disproportionate number of those who can\u2019t speak English, they\u2019re still in the minority.\n\n25% of immigrants who can\u2019t speak any English arrived after they turned 50.\n\n9.3% of immigrants who can\u2019t speak English well or at all arrived after that age.\n\nThe picture is similar in Scotland and Northern Ireland\n\n1.4% of the Scottish population and just over 0.9% of the Northern Irish population said they couldn\u2019t speak English well or at all\n\nThat\u2019s slightly lower than the 1.6% of people in England and Wales who can\u2019t do so.\n\nIn Scotland, migrants who arrived over the age of 50 were also less likely to be able to speak or write English. We haven't seen data from the Northern Irish census which shows language proficiency by age.", "lang": "en"}
