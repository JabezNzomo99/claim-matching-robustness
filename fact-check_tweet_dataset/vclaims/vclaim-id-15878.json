The claim is false; the Twitter handle in the picture is different to Tata\u2019s verified account and there is no record of Tata posting such a tweet.\n\nMultiple online posts, for example this one published to Facebook March 17, 2019, and shared more than 650 times since, contain the false image.\n\nIt purports to show a Hindi-language tweet from prominent Indian businessman Ratan Tata, the 81-year-old chairman emeritus of major conglomerate Tata Sons. Here is his profile on the Tata website.\n\nTranslated to English, the purported tweet says: \u201cNo one can save that country from being ruined where the death of 65 of its soldiers increases the popularity of its Prime Minister.\u201d\n\nThe same or similar images containing the false tweet have been published elsewhere on Facebook, for example here and here, where it has been shared nearly 600 times since being published March 26, 2019, and on Twitter for example here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of one of the misleading posts:\n\nThe image also includes Hindi text above the purported tweet that says, when translated to English: \u201cCountry's industrialist tweeted. Look at India's future through his thinking!\u201d\n\nTata\u2019s name, profile picture, and a blue \u2018verified\u2019 tick appear in the false image, along with figures suggesting the tweet was shared thousands of times.\n\nHis Twitter handle is given in the false post as \u201c@Rntata200\u201d. However a search on Twitter for Tata\u2019s official account here reveals that his verified handle is actually \u201c@RNTata2000\u201d.\n\nThe image below compares the false post (L) with a screenshot of Tata\u2019s verified account (R), with the two different handles highlighted in red by AFP:\n\nThe date given on the purported tweet is March 13, 2019. There is no record of Tata posting any tweet from his verified account on that date and all his recent tweets are in English, not Hindi.\n\nTata did post a tweet on February 26, 2019, praising Modi\u2019s leadership and hailing the Indian Air Force (IAF) for carrying out air strikes in Pakistan. Here is an AFP report on the air strikes also dated February 26.\n\nThe tweet, embedded below, says: \"We congratulate the PM and the IAF for the successful air strikes on the terrorist training camps which Pakistan has claimed never existed! India is proud of the firm action taken in retaliation to the suicide attack on our soldiers a few days ago\u201d.\n\nThere is a Twitter account with the handle @rntata200 here, but it is not verified and only has 27 followers whereas Tata\u2019s official account has 7.6 million followers.\n\nThe account\u2019s only post is dated November 24, 2011, and is not the same as the one circulated in the false Facebook post. It says: \u201cCyrus P Mistry will be the next chairman of the TATA Group starting from december 2012. cyruspmistry.com\u201d. The URL does not lead to a live website.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Twitter account @rntata200:\n\nDebasis Ray, head of public affairs for the Tata Trusts in Mumbai, told AFP in an email dated April 8, 2019: \u201cMr. Ratan N. Tata\u2019s twitter handle is @RNTata2000. You will have noticed that the post in question is from a handle -- @RnTata200.", "lang": "en"}
