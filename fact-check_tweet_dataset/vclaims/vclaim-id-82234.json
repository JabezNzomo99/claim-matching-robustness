And yet we find that he is still going on television and spreading this misinformation. In this case, he repeatedly brought up this factoid during an interview about the tragic mass shooting at a church in Charleston, S.C.\n\nGraham, who is running for the 2016 GOP nomination for president, decried the \u201clack of dedication\u201d to capturing fugitives and asserted, \u201cIf I get to be president of the United States, you fail a criminal background check, you try to buy a gun when you\u2019re not supposed to, you\u2019re going to meet the law head on.\u201d\n\nThe key purpose of the background checks in the Brady law is to prevent certain individuals \u2014 particularly those with criminal records \u2014 from easily buying guns. But from its inception, few people have been prosecuted for lying on the application form. A 2000 General Accounting Office report and a 2004 Justice Department Inspector General report disclosed a lack of clear guidelines for prosecution but also indicated that these are very hard cases to make.\n\nIn 2010, the FBI referred about 76,000 denials of firearms to an arm of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), but after a review 90 percent were not deemed worthy of further investigation, while another 4 percent turned out to be incorrect denials. But then even of the relatively small percentage of cases referred to ATF field offices, another quarter turned out to be cases of mistaken denial and most of the rest had no prosecutorial merit.\n\nWe believe that the number of referrals and prosecutions is low because of the difficulty in obtaining convictions in NICS cases. These cases lack \u201cjury appeal\u201d for various reasons. The factors prohibiting someone from possessing a firearm may have been nonviolent or committed many years ago. The basis for the prohibition may have been noncriminal (e.g., a dishonorable discharge from the U.S. military). It is also difficult to prove that the prohibited person was aware of the prohibition and intentionally lied to the FFL [federally licensed dealer]. We were also told that in parts of the United States where hunting historically has been part of the regional culture, juries are reluctant to convict a person who attempted to purchase a hunting rifle.\n\nOn the surface, these numbers might suggest Graham is on the right track. But, as we explained before, it would be wrong and misleading to assume that the federal numbers tell the whole story about prosecutions stemming from background checks. Here\u2019s what a Justice Department official explained about the people listed as fugitives in the NICS data:\n\nSpeaking generally since we\u2019re talking nearly 14,000 \u2014 most of these people are state fugitives, not federal fugitives. When NICS denies based on an outstanding warrant, they routinely call the issuing jurisdiction (that would be state/local law enforcement) and let them know that the fugitive is, at that moment, at \u201cBob\u2019s gun shop\u201d trying to buy a gun. In most cases, that means the issuing jurisdiction (state/local) will send a radio car to Bob\u2019s (the gun shop), scoop up the fugitive, then prosecute him/her in state court for whatever charges are pending. That means they get prosecuted on those charges \u2014 not NICS/gun offenses.\n\nIn other words, Graham is citing incomplete data. The state fugitives would turn up in state statistics, not federal data. Unfortunately, as far as we can tell, there does not appear to have been any nationwide study of how many fugitives are captured via background checks.\n\nHowever, the 2000 GAO report said \u201cif the background check indicates that the prospective purchaser is a fugitive (i.e., an outstanding arrest warrant exists), applicable law enforcement agencies can attempt to arrest the individual\u2026. Although no comprehensive statistics are available, some of these individuals subsequently have been arrested as a result of having been identified by the background check process.\u201d\n\nWe also did spot checks of some of the annual reports filed by state police agencies. None list the data in the same way, but both Pennsylvania and Virginia, which have state-run systems, indicated that they identified and arrested fugitives in 2010 using background checks. In the most recent year available, 2013, both states indicated that they also arrested fugitives as a result of gun background checks.\n\nThis is emerging as a \u201czombie claim\u201d \u2014 something that keeps popping up even after it has been debunked. As we explained before, just looking at the federal-level data does not tell the whole story. While there is no comprehensive nationwide survey of fugitive prosecutions, the state-level data from Virginia and Pennsylvania clearly shows that fugitives have been arrested as a result of the Brady law. Pennsylvania alone indicated that it has arrested about a 100 fugitives a year in the past 17 years.", "lang": "en"}
