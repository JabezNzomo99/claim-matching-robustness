And we are taught that Nehru and Gandhi had given us freedom,\" reads the caption of one such post.\n\nAccording to a report by Byline Times, the photograph shows an instance of Indians being flogged following the Amritsar Massacre in 1919.\n\n\n\nIn 1919, Bhagat Singh was 12 years old and a school student. He had visited Jallianwala Bagh just hours after the massacre. According to his book, The Jail Notebook and Other Writings, he had brought back some mud as memorabilia.\n\n\n\nThe Logical Indian could not independently identify the man in the photograph, however, it is clear that he is definitely not Bhagat Singh who was 12 at that time.
