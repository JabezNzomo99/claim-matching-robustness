Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., would switch parties unless the GOP stops supporting President Donald Trump.\n\nThe headlines are wrong, even though the stories use real quotes from Graham.\n\n\"Lindsey Graham threatens to convert to Democrat if Republicans don\u2019t Dump Trump,\" read the headline from a March 21, 2017, post from TrueTrumpers.com. Facebook users reported the post as potentially being fabricated, as part of the social media site\u2019s efforts to crack down on fake news.\n\nThe headline is certainly made up, because there\u2019s no evidence Graham has considered trading in his elephant for a donkey. The story, meanwhile, does use real quotes in which Graham disagreed with Trump \u2014 albeit before the real estate billionaire was president.\n\nWe can tell this is an old article, because TrueTrumpers.com\u2019s post called Trump the \"the Republican Party\u2019s presumptive nominee.\" The bulk of the story concerns Trump\u2019s attacks on U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, the judge overseeing a fraud case involving Trump University.\n\nTrump had said in June 2016 that Curiel had \"an absolute conflict\" because of his \"Mexican heritage,\" saying Curiel was biased against Trump over his calls to build a wall on the border with Mexico.\n\nCuriel shrugged off the comments, and approved a $25 million settlement in the case. The judge has recently been assigned a case brought by a young man deported in February 2017, despite being protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n\nThe TrueTrumpers.com post said Graham told the New York Times that Trump\u2019s comments were \"the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy. If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it.\"\n\nGraham did say this, in a June 6, 2016 story in the New York Times.\n\nThe post also uses another real quote from Graham, who told NBC News\u2019 Hallie Jackson the following day:\n\n\"There are a lot of people who want to be loyal to the Republican Party, including me. But there\u2019ll come a point in time where we\u2019re gonna have to understand that it\u2019s not just about the 2016 race, it\u2019s about the future of the party and I would like to support our nominee. I just can\u2019t.\"\n\nThere are also quotes from Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Susan Collins of Maine (although the post referred to Collins as a representative instead of a senator).\n\nThe TrueTrumpers.com story largely copied a June 7, 2016, article on the Huffington Post, and has appeared on other websites prior to this March 21 post.\n\nA June 9 post on WeAreChange.org had the same story, but with a slightly different headline that read, \"Lindsey Graham will become a Democrat if Republicans select Trump,\" reflecting that Trump had not yet been officially nominated. The first couple of paragraphs were altered from the Huffington Post article.\n\nBy March 20, 2017, a post on Spinzon.com had the same headline as the TrueTrumpers.com post.\n\nIt\u2019s apparent that a radical headline was slapped on the story to drive traffic. Graham did not say he was planning on changing his party affiliation, but he did disagree with Trump\u2019s comments about a federal judge.\n\nWhile the story itself is accurate (albeit with little context), the headline is not. We rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
