This apple will be available in Indian markets too- translation).\n\nThis message has been shared on social media along with some photographs showing apples with the brand name \u2018Modi\u2019 on it. It has been uploaded by a Facebook page Namo Again, and also by the group WE SUPPORT NARENDRA MODI.\n\nThe message along with the photos has also been shared on Twitter and WhatsApp.\n\nEntrepreneur Harsh Goenka was among those who tweeted about it.\n\nMuch to the chagrin of fans of Narendra Modi, the Modi apple has not been named after India\u2019s Prime Minister. It is in fact a variety of apple which was developed in Italy. The official name for this variety is CIVG198. Information about this brand of apple is available on the website www.modiapple.com. Alt News found that the domain was registered in the year 2007, long before Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister.\n\nAccording to the website, this variety of apple is named after the 19th century Italian painter Amedeo Modigliani.\n\nAnother thing to note is that Modi is spelled differently. Moreover, It has been announced by the firm that Modi apple will be launched in the Indian subcontinent.\n\nIt may be reiterated that there is no connection between Narendra Modi and this variety of apple.", "lang": "en"}
