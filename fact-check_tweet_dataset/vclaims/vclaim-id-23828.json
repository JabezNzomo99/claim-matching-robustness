The stomach-churning video shows some men floating in the turbulent sea and a few being rescued.\n\nMany social media users have claimed that the video is of a sea storm near Uran Mora. Uran Mora is a fishing village in Navi Mumbai off the Arabian Sea coast. Social media users also claimed that police are busy in relief work and there has been no loss of lives so far.\n\nIndia Today's Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the video is not from Uran Mora but from Kakdwip in West Bengal off the Bay of Bengal.\n\nFacebook user Pinky Punjabi uploaded the video of fishermen fighting an impossible battle, trying to save their boat from going under the sea. Some of these fishermen are later saved by fellow fishermen on an adjoining fishing trawler.\n\nAlong with the video posted on July 13, Pinky Punjabi wrote, \"Sea Storm today at 9 am at Uran Mora.\" The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nThis post has been shared across various social media platforms such as YouTube and Twitter with the same claims.\n\nIf one hears the video, there is a distinct Bengali conversation that can be heard among the fishermen on the trawler from where the video is being recorded.\n\nAFWA did a reverse search of the video and found that it has been uploaded on Youtube on July 8, claiming that this incident is from Kakdwip in West Bengal.\n\nIn West Bengal, fishing in the coastal areas is banned between April 15 and June 15. It is after June 15 that fishing starts. Hundreds of trawlers go out into the Bay of Bengal for fishing. This particular incident took place on July 6 at around 7 pm when these trawlers were returning from Haribhanga Char which is in Bangladesh waters.\n\nThere were 61 fishermen on board the four trawlers that drowned in the sea that evening. While most of the fishermen were picked up by fellow fishermen in adjoining trawlers, 24 fishermen are still missing. News about this can be read here and the same viral video can be seen in a news clip here\n\nAFWA also checked the Internet to see if there had been any such incident off the coast of Navi Mumbai. But we did not find any news of any fishing vessel turning turtle in the Arabian Sea off the Mumbai or Navi Mumbai coasts.\n\nIn fact, fishing is banned in the Arabian Sea off the Maharashtra coast from June 1 when monsoon arrives and the sea becomes rough.
