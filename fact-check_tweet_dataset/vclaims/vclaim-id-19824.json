Duterte, magpapadala ng warship sa Libya oras na masaktan ang 3 Pinoy na bihag doon.\u201d (President Duterte plans to send warships to Libya if the 3 kidnapped Filipinos get hurt)\n\nThe original video was taken down, along with the Facebook post in the People\u2019s Television Network (PTV 4) page that featured the same video.\n\nThe original photo comes from a Wikipedia article of the Type 054A frigate. They are Chinese utility vessels first entering service in 2007. The photograph is specifically the \u201cYueyang\u201d ship.\n\nBelow is a comparison of the original and the fabricated photo and screenshots from the now taken-down Facebook post.\n\nWhile the original video has been taken down, the same hoax photo is still being used in another related video report in PTV4's Newsbreak on August 4. The video of this segment is still up as of this posting.\n\nIn an erratum posted on its Facebook page on late Tuesday afternoon, August 7, PTV, through its news program Ulat Bayan, apologized and explained that the photo was \"downloaded from the Internet by an Ulat Bayan video editor.\"\n\nThe video editor has already been sanctioned, and other staff have been warned against repeating the error. \"Moving forward, we shall take more diligent measures to deliver straightforward and accurate news to the Filipino people,\" said PTV.\n\nThis claim was sent by a reader who wanted to verify the legitimacy of the photo. Rappler\u2019s fact-checking service also relies on its readers who send dubious online posts for checking.\n\nIf you suspect a Facebook page, group, account, a website, or an article is spreading false information, let Rappler know by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
