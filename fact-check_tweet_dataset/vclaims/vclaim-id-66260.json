And next year, $716 billion. So I wanted to let you know. And, by the way \u2014 I know you don\u2019t care about this \u2014 but that also includes raises for our military. First time in 10 years.\"\n\nThat\u2019s flat wrong. In fact, the last time that service members didn\u2019t receive an annual pay increase was in 1983.\n\nAnd that was only because of a one-time technical quirk.\n\nTrump was \"totally incorrect,\" said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"The military has gotten a pay raise each and every year.\"\n\nThe full historical rundown is available in Table 5-12 here. We summarized those figures in this chart:\n\nThe increase of 2.4 percent in 2018 represented the biggest bump since 2010. But there have been increases every year since then, ranging from 1 percent to 2.1 percent. For 2019, the White House is proposing a 2.6 percent increase; the bill to enact that pay raise is working its way through Congress.\n\nSo how about that missing increase in 1983? That was the year Congress began starting pay raises on Jan. 1 of the new year, rather than the first day of the government\u2019s fiscal year in October. So service members received their pay at the start of the fiscal year a few months earlier, just not during the calendar year, Harrison said.\n\nBeyond that, you have to go back to 1961 to find a calendar year without a military pay increase.\n\nTrump said that recent legislation \"includes raises for our military. First time in 10 years.\"\n\nThat\u2019s wrong. Depending how you count it, the most recent year without a military pay raise was either 35 or 57 years ago \u2014 not 10. And the most recent pay raise wasn\u2019t even the biggest in the past 10 years; it was exceeded by raises in 2008, 2009 and 2010, during the Bush and Obama administrations.\n\nWe rate the statement Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
