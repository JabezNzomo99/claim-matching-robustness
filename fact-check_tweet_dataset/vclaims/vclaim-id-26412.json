Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren referred to Brown\u2019s death as a \u201cmurder.\u201d\n\nOn the fifth anniversary of Brown\u2019s death, Harris tweeted, \u201cMichael Brown\u2019s murder forever changed Ferguson and America. His tragic death sparked a desperately needed conversation and a nationwide movement.\u201d Warren tweeted: \u201c5 years ago Michael Brown was murdered by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Michael was unarmed yet he was shot 6 times.\u201d\n\nSome of their fellow Democratic presidential candidates also tweeted about Brown\u2019s death, but they did not say Brown was \u201cmurdered.\u201d Sens. Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand said Brown was \u201ckilled\u201d by a police officer, which he was. However, the Obama administration investigation, conducted by the Criminal Section of the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Missouri and the FBI, found that \u201cthe evidence does not support an indictment of [officer] Darren Wilson.\u201d\n\nBrown was shot at least six times, as Warren said: The DOJ report said a ballistics analysis showed Wilson fired 12 shots and that he hit Brown six to eight times, according to autopsies. Brown\u2019s death also boosted a \u201cnationwide movement\u201d \u2014 the Black Lives Matter movement \u2014 and \u201cconversation,\u201d as Harris said.\n\nHis death led to weeks of protests, some turning violent. When a grand jury decided not to indict Wilson on Nov. 24, 2014, then-President Barack Obama addressed the nation, saying, \u201cwe need to recognize that the situation in Ferguson speaks to broader challenges that we still face as a nation. The fact is, in too many parts of this country, a deep distrust exists between law enforcement and communities of color.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division issued a separate report in 2015 on its investigation of the Ferguson Police Department, finding that the department\u2019s focus on revenue had led to \u201ca pattern of unconstitutional policing\u201d and court \u201cprocedures that raise due process concerns.\u201d It said both the police and court practices \u201creflect and exacerbate existing racial bias, including racial stereotypes\u201d and that \u201cdiscriminatory intent\u201d had contributed to racial disparities. \u201cOver time, Ferguson\u2019s police and municipal court practices have sown deep mistrust between parts of the community and the police department, undermining law enforcement legitimacy among African Americans in particular,\u201d the DOJ report said.\n\nThe city settled a wrongful death lawsuit in 2017, agreeing to pay $1.5 million to Brown\u2019s parents.\n\nBut on the issue of whether Wilson acted in self-defense in shooting Brown, the DOJ\u2019s 86-page report said that he had.\n\nThe shots Wilson fired \u201cwere in self-defense and thus were not objectively unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment,\u201d which prohibits unreasonable seizures and use of force, the report said. It concluded that Wilson\u2019s \u201cactions do not constitute prosecutable violations under the applicable federal criminal civil rights statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242, which prohibits uses of deadly force that are \u2018objectively unreasonable,\u2019 as defined by the United States Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nDepartment of Justice Report Regarding the Criminal Investigation into the Shooting Death of Michael Brown by Ferguson, Missouri Police Officer Darren Wilson, March 4, 2015: As detailed throughout this report, the evidence does not establish that the shots fired by Wilson were objectively unreasonable under federal law. The physical evidence establishes that Wilson shot Brown once in the hand, at close range, while Wilson sat in his police SUV, struggling with Brown for control of Wilson\u2019s gun. Wilson then shot Brown several more times from a distance of at least two feet after Brown ran away from Wilson and then turned and faced him. There are no witness accounts that federal prosecutors, and likewise a jury, would credit to support the conclusion that Wilson fired at Brown from behind. With the exception of the two wounds to Brown\u2019s right arm, which indicate neither bullet trajectory nor the direction in which Brown was moving when he was struck, the medical examiners\u2019 reports are in agreement that the entry wounds from the latter gunshots were to the front of Brown\u2019s body, establishing that Brown was facing Wilson when these shots were fired. This includes the fatal shot to the top of Brown\u2019s head. The physical evidence also establishes that Brown moved forward toward Wilson after he turned around to face him. The physical evidence is corroborated by multiple eyewitnesses.\n\nThose eyewitnesses \u201cstated that Brown appeared to pose a physical threat to Wilson as he moved toward Wilson.\u201d The report said that the \u201cuse of deadly force is justified when the officer has \u2018probable cause to believe that the suspect pose[s] a threat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others.'\u201d\n\nThe report went on to say that there was \u201cno credible evidence\u201d disproving Wilson\u2019s stated intent \u2014 that he believed Brown was a threat to him.\n\nDOJ report, March 4, 2015: Multiple credible witnesses corroborate virtually every material aspect of Wilson\u2019s account and are consistent with the physical evidence. Even if the evidence established that Wilson\u2019s actions were unreasonable, the government would also have to prove that Wilson acted willfully, i.e. that he acted with a specific intent to violate the law. As discussed above, Wilson\u2019s stated intent for shooting Brown was in response to a perceived deadly threat. The only possible basis for prosecuting Wilson under Section 242 would therefore be if the government could prove that his account is not true \u2013 i.e., that Brown never punched and grabbed Wilson at the SUV, never struggled with Wilson over the gun, and thereafter clearly surrendered in a way that no reasonable officer could have failed to perceive. Not only do eyewitnesses and physical evidence corroborate Wilson\u2019s account, but there is no credible evidence to disprove Wilson\u2019s perception that Brown posed a threat to Wilson as Brown advanced toward him.\n\nThe Washington Post Fact Checker in March 2015 cited the DOJ report in debunking a popular belief that Brown had raised his hands in surrender and said \u201cdon\u2019t shoot.\u201d The DOJ investigation found: \u201cWitness accounts suggesting that Brown was standing still with his hands raised in an unambiguous signal of surrender when Wilson shot Brown are inconsistent with the physical evidence, are otherwise not credible because of internal inconsistencies, or are not credible because of inconsistencies with other credible evidence.\u201d\n\nHarris and Warren may disagree with the findings of the Obama administration\u2019s Justice Department, as Michael Brown\u2019s father does. On the anniversary of Brown\u2019s death on Aug. 9, Michael Brown Sr. called for a reopening of the investigation into the fatal shooting of his son.\n\n\u201cJustice has not been served,\u201d he said, according to the Associated Press. \u201cMy son was murdered in cold blood, with no remorse and no medical treatment.\u201d\n\nWe contacted the Harris and Warren campaigns about the candidates\u2019 statements, but we have not received a response.", "lang": "en"}
