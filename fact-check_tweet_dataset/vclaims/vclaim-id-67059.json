It was even shared on Twitter Aug. 30 by Dan Scavino, the White House deputy chief of staff for communications.\n\nIn the manipulated video, Biden\u2019s eyes appear to be closed as a news anchor says, \u201cWake up. Wake up. Wake up.\u201d The sound of snoring also was added to the clip.\n\nBut the video was created by splicing together two separate videos. The chyron that says \u201cON AIR: JOE BIDEN | THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ELECTION\u201d was made-up too.\n\nThe video of the news anchor, Leyla Santiago, comes from a 2011 segment during a local news show in California. She was trying to interview entertainer and activist Harry Belafonte, who was reportedly meditating and couldn\u2019t hear her due to audio issues. That\u2019s why she can be heard saying in the manipulated video, \u201cThis is your wake-up call, Harry.\u201d\n\nThe video of Biden comes from a virtual town hall he did with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in April. The manipulated version uses a moment from that event when Biden appears to be looking down.\n\nSnopes.com found that Twitter user @damonimani took credit for mixing the two videos together and adding the sound effects.\n\nTwitter later labeled the altered interview video as \u201cmanipulated media,\u201d and has since removed it in response to a claim filed by a copyright holder. The version that Scavino shared from his personal Twitter account was watched 2.4 million times.\n\nTrump campaign Communications Director Tim Murtaugh told the Washington Post Fact Checker: \u201cThis was a retweet of someone else\u2019s video, and it was quite obviously a parody. It is sad that there is actual concern that people could mistake it for the real thing, though.\u201d\n\nPeople did mistake it or question whether it could be real, as evidenced by the multiple questions we received about the video from our readers.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.
