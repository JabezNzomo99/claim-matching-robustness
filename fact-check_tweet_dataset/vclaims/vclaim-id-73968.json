Kamala Harris, D-California, to moderate tweets posted by U.S. President Donald Trump. Joe Biden, the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, tapped Harris as his vice-presidential running mate in August 2020.\n\nThe media pile-on was initiated on Aug. 5, 2020, after Twitter\u2019s Nick Pacilio stated in a tweet that a post from Trump\u2019s reelection campaign account, retweeted by Trump, had been removed for violating the platform\u2019s rules against spreading misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\nBut the tweet above, posted by the co-founder of The Federalist website, is misleading.\n\nFirst, Pacilio isn\u2019t currently Harris\u2019 press secretary \u2014 he served in that role from 2011 to 2014, while Harris was the attorney general of California. Second, he doesn\u2019t enforce Twitter rules in his role at the company.\n\nAlthough the tweet above, and other content like it, insinuated that Pacilio was hired recently (late summer of 2020) by Twitter, Pacilio\u2019s employment there actually started in 2014. Furthermore, in Pacilio\u2019s position with Twitter\u2019s communications department, he has no role in platform rules.\n\nThat latter point was made pointedly in a tweet by Brandon Borrman, Twitter\u2019s head of communications:", "lang": "en"}
