This claim is false; the store fronts in the photos do not match protest livestreams broadcast by local media at the same street on the same day; at least one of the signs visible in the photos belonged to a shop that had closed in January 2020.\n\nThe photos were published here on Twitter on May 24, 2020. It has since been shared more than 4,000 times.\n\nBoth photos provide an aerial view of the streets of Hong Kong's popular shopping district Causeway Bay, which appear to be packed with people.\n\nAlso Read: Photo From 2018 Police Training Exercise Given Hong Kong Protests Spin\n\nThe caption of the Twitter post, written in simplified Chinese, translates to English as: \"From a wide angle, check out today's heroic act of Hong Kong protesters who are not afraid of death\".\n\nThousands of people took to the streets in Hong Kong on May 24, 2020, to protest a controversial security law proposed by China. Police fired tear gas and water cannons in an attempt to disperse the crowd, according to this report by AFP.\n\nThe photos were also shared here on Facebook and here on the Hong Kong-based viral site 9GAG alongside a similar claim.\n\nHowever, livestreams from local media on the day show that neither of the photos were taken during the May 24 protests.\n\nThrough a keyword search, AFP located this Facebook Live video broadcast by Hong Kong newspaper Apple Daily on May 24.\n\nAt the video's six-hour, 17-minute and 19-second mark, a section of a street shows the adjacent Bank of China, Citibank and Breitling buildings, which corresponds to the photos in the misleading post.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Apple Daily livestream at the above timestamp:\n\nThe Apple Daily video, however, differs from the photos in that there is no advertisement on the Breitling building, and no scaffolding on the Bank of China building.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison between the first (L) and second (C) photos in the misleading post and a keyframe of the Apple Daily live video (R) with mismatched features circled in yellow by AFP:\n\nSimilarly, the scaffolding and advertisement seen in the photos are also missing in this live video broadcast by Hong Kong broadcaster i-CABLE News Channel on YouTube on May 24.\n\nAlso Read: Video Of Chinese Man Arrested In Java Shared With Misleading Claim\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison between the first (L) and second (C) photos in the misleading post and the i-CABLE video at its 47-minute 11-second mark (R) with mismatched features circled in yellow by AFP:\n\nAlso, a close examination of the first photo in the misleading post shows a shop sign reading \"Chow Sang Sang\" next to the Breitling sign.\n\nA screenshot of the first photo with the Chow Sang Sang shop sign circled yellow by AFP\n\nThis March 2020 report by Hong Kong newspaper Ming Pao says that particular branch of Hong Kong jewellery company Chow Sang Sang had closed in January 2020.\n\nThe misleading claim was also debunked by Hong Kong fact checking organisations Kauyim Media here and TrueNews here.", "lang": "en"}
