Kavanaugh\u2019s house was not attacked, and the photo illustrating the reports was taken in Canada in 2016.\n\n\u201cProtesters wearing masks, shouted profane slogans, waved signs, and threw calendars, bricks, and bottles at the property,\u201d of Brett Kavanaugh, the controversial American Supreme Court nominee, according to an article on abcnews.live, a spoof of the American Broadcasting Channel\u2019s website.\n\nThe article was originally published on September 30 on trumpbetrayed.us, one of many websites affiliated to America\u2019s Last Line of Defense. America\u2019s Last Line of Defense is a network of self-proclaimed satirical news websites whose content is often copied and republished without disclaimers. The Kavanaugh story was no exception, and quickly spread online.\n\nDespite the current climate of political division in US politics, no mob of \u201c200 left-wing protesters\u201d launched a coordinated attack on Kavanaugh\u2019s house. The address of the house mentioned in the story, 1512 Whiteman Street in Mayo Lake, PA, does not exist. No town bears the name of Mayo Lake in Pennsylvania, and Judge Kavanaugh and his family actually live in the US state of Maryland.\n\nOne of the photos illustrating the false article shows two women erasing graffiti from a house, and was allegedly taken by Kavanaugh\u2019s neighbors, according to the trumpbetrayed.us article.\n\nThe picture was not taken in Mayo Lake, Pennsylvania, nor was it taken in the United States. It was taken by Cathie Coward, a Hamilton Spectator staff photographer, in 2016 in Ancaster, Ontario, in Canada.\n\nThe house in the photo was vandalized in a misdirected reprisal against its owners, thought to have cut down a city-owned tree, when city workers had in fact cut the tree down, the Hamilton Spectator reported at the time. The inscription, \u201cThis tree is worth 10,000 of you\u201d is visible on the photograph even in the fabricated story.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Last Line of Defense and its affiliated websites and Facebook pages have started many viral rumours in the past, always written as satire, yet often mistaken for true stories.", "lang": "en"}
