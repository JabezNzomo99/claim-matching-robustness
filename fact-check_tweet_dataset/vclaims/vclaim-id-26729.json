Check if your name is in the list of the people who have the rights to withdraw this benefit: https://socialdraw.top/epf\"\n\nThe forward includes the EPFO's real website www.epfindia.gov.in to pull its logo and lend credibility to the message but redirects a user to the fake site - socialdraw.top/epf\n\nThe URL socialdraw.top/epf is a giveaway that the site is not genuine. Government websites in India end with the domain name .gov.in.\n\nA Google search for EPFO's official website (EPFO official website) shows the right URL - https://www.epfindia.gov.in \n\n\n\n2. Top Half Of The Site Is An Image\n\n\n\nThe top portion of the site 'socialdraw.top/epf' is actually an image and not clickable unlike the EPFO's actual website where one can click on various menu options. The image was uploaded to the fake site under the file name 'header'.\n\nThe bottom half of the site asks users to answer three questions which are as follows. The questions are replete with grammatical mistakes such 'did you worked.'\n\u2022 Are you over 18 years old?\n\u2022 Did you worked (sic) in one of periods between 1990 - 2019?\n\u2022 Are you currently working somewhere?\n\n\n\nA Whois look-up of the site shows it was recently created on October 15, 2019.\n\nThe fake site uses eerily similar text on its site as scammers in South Africa. South Africa's Department of Labour had warned of the same in April this year. Click here to read the press release.\n\nLike the Indian site the message in South Africa said, \"The workers who worked between the 1990 and 2019, have the rights to get the benefits of $R30.000 by Department of Labour of South Africa\u201d \u2013\n\nIndia's EPFO in recent days has been warning provident fund holders of potential frauds. In general, it asks PF holders to never provide their Universal Account Numbers (UAN), PAN or Aadhaar details to anyone over the phone.\n\nIt also states that the agency will never call subscribers asking them to deposit any amount in any bank account.", "lang": "en"}
