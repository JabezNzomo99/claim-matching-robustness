Including things like hospitals, public health initiatives, education training and IT, the cost was \u00a3125 billion.\n\nThis is paid for mainly through general taxation, and National Insurance contributions from employees, employers and the self-employed.\n\nGeneral taxation funds about 80% of the budget, and National Insurance contributions cover most of the rest. Total NI contributions to the NHS in 2017/18 were estimated to be just under \u00a324 billion, which is just under 20% of the total budget.\n\nA small amount of cash is generated by patient charges, like those for prescriptions and dental care, which were introduced in the 1950s. In 2016/17, \u00a3555 million was charged for prescriptions in England. In total, \u00a31.6 billion was collected in patient charges in 2016/17.\n\nIn Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, there are no charges for prescriptions. Health is a devolved matter, so these governments decide how much to spend on health from the block grant they receive from central government.\n\nNational insurance contributions became a much bigger part of the contribution to health spending in 2003 (from 12% in 2002 to 20%) when rates of contribution were increased to accommodate proposed increases to health spending.\n\nTheresa May announced recently that the NHS in England would get a real terms funding increase of just over \u00a320 billion by 2023/24. She said this was a 3.4% annual increase, accounting for inflation.\n\nShe said part of this would come from a \u201cBrexit dividend\u201d, although extra money following ceasing payments to the EU are not guaranteed. She also said that \u201ctaxpayers will have to contribute a bit more in a fair and balanced way to support the NHS\u201d, implying some of it would come from taxation.
