Col. Davina Petermann of the U.S. Air Forces in Europe \u2013 Air Forces Africa Public Affairs Office told Polygraph.info that U.S. Air Force B-52 Stratofortresses were conducting training flights on March 20 in the Baltics and Poland \u201cas a clear and visible demonstration of U.S. commitment to regional security.\u201d\n\nPetermann said while a U.S. B-52 was exercising its \u201cfreedom of navigation and overflight\u201d in international airspace, it had \u201ca routine interaction with a Russian Su-27 while conducting operations over the Baltic Sea.\u201d\n\nShe said the B-52 pilots were using their transponders and operating in line with international law.\n\n\u201cThe Russian aircraft did not chase the B-52 away, and the bomber was able to complete its mission,\u201d Petermann said, adding \u201coperations and engagements with our allies and partners demonstrate and strengthen our shared commitment to global security and stability.\n\nPetermann affirmed the B-52 was not diverted from Russia\u2019s borders, nor was its course changed, as a result of that \"routine interaction,\" reiterating it \u201cwas able to complete its mission as scheduled.\u201d\n\nThe B-52s conducted flights from RAF Fairford, England, to Lithuania and Poland for the purposes of \u201cinteroperability training with NATO Enhanced Forward Presence units,\u201d a U.S. Air Force press release read.\n\nAccording to that statement, the B-52s conducted training with NATO Joint Terminal Attack Controllers attached to the multinational battalion battle group in Lithuania and Battle Group Poland.\n\n\u201cIn Lithuania, the B-52s dropped inert munitions and integrated into Close Air Support training alongside Lithuanian L-39 Albatros high-performance training jets,\u201d the statement read.\n\nThe bombers arrived in the area on March 14-16.\n\nThe statement continued that operating out of forward locations \u201cenables collective defense capabilities and provide the U.S. and NATO the strategic and operational breadth needed to deter adversaries and assure our allies and partners.\u201d\n\nSteffan Watkins, a Canadian IT security consultant and open source intelligence enthusiast, however, disputes portions of the U.S. Air Force\u2019s account. He also disputes Russia\u2019s conclusions.\n\nWatkins said that on the day of the intercept, his reading of open source flight trackers indicated that one of the two American planes which flew in formation over the Baltic Sea were using transponders.\n\nWatkins said that while the Russian Su-27s photographed the American B-52 numbered 61-0013, \u201cthere was another with their transponder on, not photographed, that shows up as 60-0061 (which it is not),\u201d he told Polygraph.info.\n\n\u201cThe lead plane (60-0061) flew right at the Kaliningrad flight information region and did a 90 degree turn to the right,\u201d he said.\n\nWatkins claims that as 61-0013 \u201cdoesn\u2019t use\u201d a transponder, \u201cthe Russians were completely justified in intercepting it, just as NATO intercepts (Russian Air Force) flights without transponders (over) the Baltic.\u201d\n\nWatkins points out that the Russian Su-27 fighter jets did not use transponders, even as the fighters approached U.S. aircraft in international airspace. \u200b\n\n\u201cWhat I wonder is why the Russians didn't say they intercepted two bombers? Did they miss the other? Was their radar blind? For all we know the U.S. took out the radar with a cyber attack or otherwise blinded them with something sneaky/electronic warfare related,\u201d he said, adding those assumptions were \u201chighly speculative.\u201d\n\nThat said, Watkins added there is no evidence to support the B-52s were \"chased off.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026The B-52 made a 90 degree right turn right before getting to the Kaliningrad FIR, which, if the Su-27s were headed directly at them, would *sort of* look like they were fleeing... which I'm sure they weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted regarding Watkin\u2019s comments, Petermann confirmed to Polygraph.info the plane that had an interaction with the SU-27s was 60-0013. But she dismissed any suggestion that the U.S. Air Force bombers were not using their transponders.\n\n\u201cAll B-52 aircraft are equipped with Mode 3C transponders and they squawk the assigned Air Traffic Control code in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organization procedures at all times,\u201d Peterman said.\n\nEarlier 'Interactions' Between Russian and US Air Forces\n\nThe March 20 interaction is not the first time disputes have arisen between the Russian and U.S. air forces over international waters.\n\nIn November, an \u201cinteraction\u201d between a U.S. Navy EP-3E Aries II reconnaissance aircraft flying over the Black Sea in international airspace and a Russian Su-27 fighter jet prompted allegations from the U.S. side of an unsafe flyby.\n\nIn August 2018, the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump moved to suspend funding for the Open Skies Treaty after the U.S. accused Russia of not complying with the terms of the international agreement, which allows states to perform a certain number of observation flights over each other\u2019s\u2019 territories.\n\nAnd in January 2018, a Su-27 was accused of \u201cintimidating\u201d a U.S. \u0415\u0420-3\u0415 Aries II in international airspace over the Black Sea after reportedly getting within five feet and \u201ccrossing directly in front of the U.S. aircraft.\u201d\n\nThe European Leadership Network [ELN], a London-based policy group focusing on defense and security issues, reported that 66 such incidents identifiable from public sources had taken place between March 2014 and March 2015.\n\nAs for the March 20 incident, the video evidence provided by the Russian Defense Ministry does not corroborate its version of events, while the language used in the Russian state media report appears to sensationalize the Russian government's version of events.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force information would be dispositive for purposes of this fact check, if it were accompanied by verifiable information, which it is not.\n\nAs it is, the Air Force statement comports with U.S. and NATO policies regarding operations in the region setting up a verbal disagreement between the two sides.\n\nWithout additional evidence, Polygraph.info at present finds the Russian claims regarding the incident to be unclear. Should more definitive video, or other information emerge, we will reconsider our verdict.", "lang": "en"}
