Hundreds suffered brutal beatings at the hands of Cossacks. A majority of the protesters were young people aged 12 to 25. Photos and videos emerged on social media of police detaining scores of teenagers. There were no reports of protesters behaving violently.\n\n\u201cWhy is Putin afraid of this young man?\u201d Michael McFaul, former U.S. Ambassador to Russia tweeted on Saturday commenting on the picture of a 14-year-old protester arrested by riot police.\n\n\u201cPutin pretended he did not notice the youth protests, and ignored it in his inaugural speech,\u201d Lev Ponomarev, director of the Russian NGO, For Human Rights, told Polygraph.info. Putin\u2019s statement has \u201cvery little to do with reality,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand the young people hear what the President tells them from the TV screen, on the other \u2013 they see the reality with their own eyes,\u201d Yuri Djibladze, the president of Moscow-based NPO, For the Development of Democracy and Human Rights, told Polygraph.info, \u201cNo one will believe him.\u201d\n\nThere are numerous Kremlin-created and supported youth organizations in Russia that are loyal to Putin and support his policies. These include the notorious Nashi (Ours) movement, now inactive, Molodaya Gvardiya (Young Guard). Young people who belong to such pro-Putin organization reportedly benefit both financially and socio-politically.\n\nYoung critics of the Putin government are treated differently.\n\n\u201cPutin and his system are not capable of an intelligent, tolerant, positive approach to the freedom-loving youth, but respond with brutal repression, like how it responded to the protests on Saturday,\u201d Ponomarev said. He added that the number of young people \u201ccritical of the authoritarian system, which is now moving towards a totalitarian regime, is growing.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
