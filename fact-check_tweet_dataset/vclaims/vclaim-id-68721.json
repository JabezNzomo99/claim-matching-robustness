And ever since then, continually my whole time in the legislature, we have loosened restriction.\"\n\nWe were wondering, are machine guns legal in Missouri? Are they under federal or state jurisdiction? And, has Missouri loosened restrictions on them? We tried to reach out to Newman to clarify her statement, but received no response.\n\nThe sale of automatic weapons has been restricted since the National Firearms Act was enacted in 1934. The act was inspired, in part, because of frequent use of machine guns in crime, including the 1929 St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre in Chicago and the 1933 Union Station Massacre in Kansas City.\n\n\"It essentially amounted to a ban, because it became a crime to possess a machine gun without having it properly registered with the government,\" Rostron said. \"But technically it wasn\u2019t actually a ban, because it didn\u2019t prohibit machine guns. It just made them subject to much stricter regulations than other guns.\"\n\nPrior to 2011, Missouri prohibited the possession of machine guns in the state. HB 294, which Newman referenced, \"Allows a person to possess, manufacture, transport, repair, or sell a machine gun, short barreled rifle or shotgun, or firearm silencer if he or she conforms with federal law,\" according to the bill summary. The bill passed by a majority in both the House and the Senate and was signed into law by Gov. Jay Nixon.\n\n\"If her statement gives people the impression that machine guns have been legalized in Missouri and so now they\u2019re not subject to any special restrictions, then that is not correct, because machine guns remain subject to the federal (National Firearms Act) restrictions that apply throughout the nation,\" Rostron said.\n\nHowever, other experts disagreed, and claimed that machine guns are solely a federal issue.", "lang": "en"}
