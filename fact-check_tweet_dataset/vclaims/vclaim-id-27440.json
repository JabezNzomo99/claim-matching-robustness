Adam Schiff, D-Calif.\n\nTo be clear, Fox News also aired graphics presenting the same biographical information about Taylor, Schiff and others found on other TV news networks.\n\nBut the visuals featuring Trump-friendly claims had social media users buzzing. So we decided to put the false and misleading claims in context.\n\nA screenshot of Fox News' coverage of the Nov. 13 hearing.\n\nThis claim is in reference to the way Schiff described the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nDuring a Sept. 26 congressional hearing, Schiff gave his interpretation of what Trump said on the call, which he said \"reads like a classic organized crime shakedown.\" He was not reading word-for-word from the readout of the call, but Republicans said he made it seem like he was.\n\nWhen Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, pointed out that what Schiff said did not match the readout of the call, Schiff said his summary was \"meant to be at least part in parody.\"\n\nWe noted that Schiff explicitly introduced his remarks as \"the essence of what the president communicates\" and described them as \"in sum and character, what the president was trying to communicate.\" He said he was presenting Trump\u2019s message \"shorn of its rambling character and in not so many words,\" and he never pretended to offer Trump\u2019s exacts words.\n\nWe also compared Schiff\u2019s dramatized version to the White House readout of the call. We found that his summary was mostly accurate with a few exaggerations.\n\n\"Schiff admitted to not being clear about contact w/ whistleblower\"\n\nSchiff did learn the outlines of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint days before it was submitted to the intelligence community inspector general, despite what he said several times in September.\n\nBut there\u2019s no evidence that Schiff personally had contact with the whistleblower, nor is there evidence that he helped write the complaint that spurred the launch of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nSeeking guidance, the whistleblower turned to a House Intelligence Committee aide, who advised the whistleblower to get a lawyer and file a complaint through the formal channels, per the committee procedures. The aide shared some of that information with Schiff.\n\nWhen this information came out, we rated Schiff\u2019s September claim that \"we have not spoken directly with the whistleblower\" False. His spokesperson told us his statement should have been more carefully phrased, and Schiff later said he should have been more clear.\n\n\"Trump has repeatedly implied that Schiff has committed treason\"\n\nA screenshot of Fox News' coverage of the Nov. 13 hearing.\n\nTrump has repeatedly accused Schiff of treason for his retelling of Trump\u2019s June 25 call with Zelensky. But experts and the Constitution say Schiff\u2019s actions don\u2019t constitute treason.\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted, treason is defined narrowly in the Constitution to keep it from being applied to mere differences of opinion. The Constitution defines it this way:\n\n\"Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.\"\n\nBecause the definition is so narrow, charges have only been brought a few dozen times in the country\u2019s history. Experts agreed that nothing Schiff has said or done constitutes treason.\n\nTrump\u2019s accusation blurs the distinction between loyalty to a president and loyalty to the United States, said Carlton Larson, a law professor at the University of California-Davis and author of a book on treason. Even if Schiff had made up Trump\u2019s words, it wouldn\u2019t count as treason.\n\nA screenshot of Fox News' coverage of the Nov. 13 hearing.\n\nTrump has called Taylor, a career diplomat and military veteran, a \"Never Trumper,\" including on Twitter the morning of Taylor\u2019s testimony.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that Taylor would qualify as a Never Trumper under any reasonable definition for the term, and leading Never Trumpers told us they had never heard of him associating with the movement. We rated Trump\u2019s statement False.\n\nTaylor is currently the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, a role known as the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asked him to fill. He has worked in every administration since 1985, including most recently as ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009.\n\nWhen Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., asked Taylor during his testimony if he was a Never Trumper, Taylor said no.", "lang": "en"}
