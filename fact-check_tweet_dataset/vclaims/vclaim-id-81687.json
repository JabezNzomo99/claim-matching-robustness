The senate candidate was the ninth of 10 kids of a restaurant hostess and a police officer. She grew up in Rhawnhurst. She\u2019s hosted numerous campaign events at diners.\n\nBut what\u2019s drawn the most scrutiny over the last few days are the statements she\u2019s made about college. The third paragraph on the about page of McGinty\u2019s website touts a claim we often hear about candidates from less privileged upbringings: \"She was the first in her family to go to a four-year college.\" Keep an eye on that phrasing.\n\nThroughout her campaign, McGinty has returned to this theme. She was quoted by the AP in January , \"As the ninth of 10 kids and the first in my family to go to college, I\u2019ve been privileged to live the American dream.\" This week, McGinty\u2019s account tweeted what appeared to be a comment from a college student \"Katie understands what I\u2019m going through. She was the 1st in her family to go to a 4-year college & didn\u2019t let anything hold her back.\"\n\nThen that one of McGinty\u2019s older brothers had attended and graduated from LaSalle University nearly a decade before McGinty entered St. Joseph\u2019s.\n\nThe brother, John Patrick McGinty, Jr., first attended the Community College of Philadelphia and then graduated from La Salle in 1973 with a bachelor of arts degree, according to the 1973 commencement program . A spokesperson for La Salle confirmed to Billy Penn the university was a four-year college, and that to graduate from the university, one would have to attend the university.\n\nMcGinty graduated from St. Joseph\u2019s in 1985, according to a list of notable alumni from the university, and started there in 1981, according to her LinkedIn page.\n\nThrough campaign spokesperson Josh Levitt, brother John provided this statement: \"The way that Katie and our family have always talked about our experience is she was the first of the 10 McGinty kids to attend and graduate from a four-year college, straight out of high school. We were all really proud of that, just as we were proud that I earned my degree by completing a two-year program and then enrolling in La Salle.\"\n\nU.S. Senate candidate Katie McGinty\u2019s campaign website claims she was first person in her family to go to a four-year college. She\u2019s elided this statement further through the course of her campaign.\n\nBut documentation from La Salle, a four-year institution, shows her brother, John McGinty, graduated from the university in 1973 with a bachelor\u2019s of arts, and the university confirmed to Buzzfeed he started attending the school in 1971.\n\nJohn took a different route to a four-year college by first attending Philadelphia Community College, so McGinty was the first in her family to attend *only* a four-year college directly out of high school. But the language used on McGinty\u2019s website and at other times throughout her campaign doesn\u2019t include this important distinction.", "lang": "en"}
