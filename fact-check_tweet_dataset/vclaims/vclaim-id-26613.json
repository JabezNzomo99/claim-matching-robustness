The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nTo verify the claim along with the viral image, we ran a reverse search and found that the fingerprint building\u2019 is not a real building, but in fact, a digital creation. We found some articles claiming that the digital art work was part of a marketing campaign by advertising agency SpicyH, based out of Bangkok in Thailand.\n\nSpicyH had created this campaign for a Bangkok-based company named It Works\u2019, which manufactures fingerprint security systems such as software and panels. SpicyH had created three different architectural designs Home, Office and Lab as can be seen here. Details attached to the campaign say it was aired in March 2011.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that the claim attached to the viral photo is not true, as this is not a real building.", "lang": "en"}
