It shows a few buildings standing amid piles of rubble near what looks like the ocean.\n\n\"Pray for the Bahamas. This is Abaco Island,\" the post reads. \"The Bahamas holds a special place in my heart and waking up to this picture of the devastation from Dorian is heartbreaking.\"\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) And it\u2019s been shared more than 1,500 times, so we decided to check it out.\n\nPolitiFact messaged the user who posted the photo to see where they got it, but we haven\u2019t heard back.\n\nA reverse image search for the photo pointed us to a story from WKRG-TV in Mobile, Ala., which was originally published by WFLA-TV in Tampa. The lead photo for that article, captured by Getty Images, is identical to the one published on Facebook.\n\nBut that story was published May 23 \u2014 before Hurricane Dorian formed in the Atlantic Ocean. The caption indicates that the image was taken Oct. 17, 2018, in Mexico Beach, Fla., after Hurricane Michael \u2014 a storm that caused catastrophic damage in the Florida Panhandle.\n\nHowever, early reports and images from the Bahamas, and the Abaco Islands specifically, do indicate that there has been widespread devastation. The New York Times reported that thousands of homes have been destroyed, and early images from the Associated Press show flooding and structural damage.\n\nThe Facebook post is not accurate. We rate it False.", "lang": "en"}
