A post is going viral on social media having a picture of a lady protesting at Delhi\u2019s Jawahar Lal Nehru University. By sharing the image users are claiming that the lady appearing in the image is 43 years old student of JNU and her daughter also studies in JNU.\n\nIn our Investigation, we found the claim to be fake. The lady in the viral image is 23 years old student of JNU, not 43 years old.\n\nA post is going viral on social media having a picture of a lady protesting at Delhi\u2019s Jawahar Lal Nehru University with claim: \u201c\u092e\u094b\u0939\u0930\u094d\u0924\u092e\u093e JNU \u0915\u0940 43 \u0938\u093e\u0932 \u0915\u0940 \u091b\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e \u0939\u0948, \u0914\u0930 \u0915\u092e\u093e\u0932 \u0915\u0940\n\n \u092c\u093e\u0924 \u0909\u0928\u0915\u0940 \u092c\u0947\u091f\u0940 \u092e\u094b\u0928\u093e \u092d\u0940 12 \u0935\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0902 JNU \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0939\u0940 \u092a\u095c\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\u201d\n\nWe noticed that the viral photo is a screengrab of Zee News\u2019 show DNA. So we reached out to Zee News\u2019 Youtube account and found the same video. The video was aired on 15th November 2019 with headline \u201cDNA Analysis of JNU students misbehaviour with Zee News Reporters\u201d\n\nIn this video, we can see AISA\u2019s (All India Student Association) banners. So, we contacted AISA\u2019s National Chief, Sandeep Saurav regarding the viral post. Saurav said, \u201cviral post is fake and the girl appearing in the grab is not 43 years old\u201d. Saurav also told us that the name of the girl appearing in the viral picture is Shambhavi Siddhi and she is pursuing M.A. French from JNU.\n\nWe now contacted Shambhavi Siddhi regarding the post. Shambhavi Said, \u201cMy name is Shambhavi Siddhi, and I am a student of masters 2nd year, french literature and I am 23 years old. The fact remains that, while everything else is just post-truth. Our intentions are right and we will keep protesting against privatization of education and save JNU from the hands to these miscreants.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why women are primary target of fake news mongers, she said, \u201cBecause of course, they are scared that we\u2019ll get educated and liberate ourselves from the clutches of patriarchy and basically just dismantle and destroy this whole patriarchal system at work..\u201d\n\nMany people are sharing this post on social media. One of these is a Facebook profile named \u201cVikram Singh\u201d.\n\nConclusion: In our Investigation, we found the claim to be fake. The lady in the viral photo is 23 years old student of JNU, not 43 years old.", "lang": "en"}
