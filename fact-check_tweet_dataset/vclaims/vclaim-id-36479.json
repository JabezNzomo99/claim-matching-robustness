As store shelves were temporarily emptied, a viral message started to circulate on social media that claimed anyone looking for baby formula during this pandemic could obtain some by simply calling the number on the back of one of these products:\n\nThis viral meme reads: \u201cFor parents who cannot find formula in stores for their babies right now grab the can of formula that you do have, and call the number on the back and they will send you a whole case during this time!\u201d\n\nThis is not true. You can\u2019t receive a free case of baby formula simply by calling the number on the back of a product. This claim appears to have originated out of whole cloth.\n\nOne red flag that indicates this post contains faulty advice is that no specific company is identified in the message. We searched the websites of some of the larger baby formula brands, such as Gerber and Enfamil, and found no announcements about how parents could obtain baby formula via this method during the pandemic.\n\nThe Motherload, a Facebook group for mothers, reached out to Aptamil Customer Services and quoted the company as saying the rumor was false. From the Facebook post:\n\nAnd a spokesperson for that company also confirmed to Yahoo News that the rumor was false:\n\nA spokesperson for Gerber confirmed to us via email that this rumor wasn\u2019t true. Gerber also told us that families can find information about discounted products on the website gerber.com/coupons:\n\nAs a partner for both parents and healthcare professionals, we know our products play a vital role in a family\u2019s life. We are here to help navigate the coronavirus (COVID-19) situation and ensure families can access our nutritional formulas, foods and beverages as the response to the pandemic evolves. We want to reassure families across the nation that there is currently adequate supply of Gerber infant formula in the United States. We are working closely with our retail partners to restock any empty shelves as quickly as possible to meet demand. We have increased production and are now operating seven days a week, doing everything we can to quickly fill retail orders as soon as they\u2019re received so we can help stores maintain their stocks. We are aware of rumors claiming that Gerber is giving away free formula in response to the out of stocks. While this is not true, we are committed to our goal of supporting babies and families with dependable, affordable nutrition, and parents can find information about discounts by visiting https://gerber.com/coupons.\n\nOn March 16, Enfamil also responded to this rumor via a Facebook post. Enfamil confirmed that they were not giving away free cases of formula and informed parents that they can use the Enfamil store locator or the Enfamil shop to find baby formula:", "lang": "en"}
