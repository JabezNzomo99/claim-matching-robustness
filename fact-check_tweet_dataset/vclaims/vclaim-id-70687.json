But we have to act with more urgency \u2013 because a changing climate is already harming western communities struggling with drought, and coastal cities dealing with floods.\"\n\nWe wondered whether Obama was correct that \"over the past eight years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth.\"\n\nWe turned to data from the , a trusted source for all types of energy data run by the U.S. Energy Department. The agency has a table showing \"total carbon dioxide emissions from the consumption of energy.\"\n\nObama is correct if you measure the total reduction in carbon emissions. Between 2003 and 2011 -- the latest eight-year period for which data is available -- the United States\u2019 carbon emissions fell from 5.853 billion metric tons to 5.490 billion metric tons. That\u2019s a reduction of 363 million metric tons -- far larger than any other country.\n\nHowever, the statistic is not as enlightening as it would seem, because it fails to account for the relative size of countries.\n\n \n\n A more useful comparison is to measure the percentage reduction for countries all around the world. We looked at the largest nations -- those with at least 100 million tons of carbon emissions in 2011 -- and found six other nations that managed to cut their carbon emissions more steeply than the United States did during the past eight years. They are:\n\nTo be fair, many nations increased their emissions over that period -- including such big economies as China, India and Russia -- and in this context, the scale of the United States\u2019 cuts is impressive. Still, this suggests that a half-dozen advanced industrialized economies made emissions cuts that were larger, proportionately, than the United States achieved.\n\nObama said, \"Over the past eight years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth.\" Looked at by the total amount of emission reductions, Obama is right. But when you look at the scale of the cuts proportionately -- which puts nations on a more equal footing when making comparisons -- the United States did not achieve the kind of steep cuts that other industrialized countries did.
