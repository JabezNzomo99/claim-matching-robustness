After protecting those now in receipt of EU funding, we will still have billions more to spend on our priorities. We propose that at least \u00a35.5 billion of that be spent on the NHS by 2020, giving it a much-needed \u00a3100 million per week cash transfusion, and to use \u00a31.7 billion to abolish VAT on household energy bills.\n\nAn open letter signed by leading Leave campaigners this morning implies that leaving the EU will benefit public finances, leaving \u00a35.5bn more to spend on the NHS and allowing VAT to be removed on energy bills.\n\nThe Leave campaign say that this would still be possible, even if all funding which now comes from the EU was replaced by direct funding from the UK government.\n\nWould there be more money to spend on public services?\n\nMost economists think it's unlikely to be the case. Most predict that leaving the EU would probably put additional strain on the UK public finances overall, making it harder to pay for public services out of tax revenue.\n\nAfter leaving the EU, the UK would gain discretion over about \u00a313bn per year, based on the UK\u2019s contributions for 2015. \u00a34.5 billion of that already comes back to the UK in spending, but the UK doesn\u2019t control where it\u2019s spent. If that was used to replace lost EU funding, then about \u00a38.5bn would be left to spend on government priorities.\n\nVote Leave is suggesting that \u00a35.5bn of the savings on the UK\u2019s membership fee could be allocated to the the NHS, and \u00a31.7bn to repeal VAT on household fuel. This isn\u2019t an unrealistic sum of money if savings on the membership fee are considered on their own.\n\nBut focusing on the membership fee alone would be a red herring. Experts on both sides agree that the potential impact on economic growth would be much bigger than any savings on the membership fee\u2014 whether or not they think the effect on growth would be positive or negative.\n\nMost economists forecast the UK will have grown less by 2020, the time frame referred to by Vote Leave, should the UK leave the EU. If this were the case then the loss in potential tax revenue would probably outweigh the gains from not paying the membership fee.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies, a think tank that has surveyed the economic forecasts, has stated its position clearly:\n\nAs a result, the Institute for Fiscal Studies forecasts that extra years or additional cuts would be required to meet a political target of eliminating the deficit.\n\nHow this would impact the NHS is less clear. Past governments have chosen to protect NHS spending and, during the most recent recession, UK spending on the NHS continued to increase. So the size of the NHS budget is not directly related to how much tax revenue is available.\n\nFinally, the UK might also end up contributing to the EU budget under future trade agreements, as Norway does.\n\nWould the UK be able to lower VAT on household energy bills?\n\nThe UK would be able to lower VAT on domestic energy bills if the UK voted to leave. VAT on household gas and electricity is currently charged at 5% in the UK and EU rules mean we can\u2019t lower this..\n\nThe EU sets a standardised system for VAT across EU member countries, including a standard VAT rate of no less than 15% and a reduced rate for certain goods or services of no less than 5%. The UK has charged household energy at 5% since 1997.\n\nWhether rates would be lowered if the UK votes to leave would be a decision for future governments.", "lang": "en"}
