Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: 5-meter tall human skeleton was unearthed in Australia by a team of archaeologists from the University of Adelaide. Fact: The news was taken from a satirical website called \u2018World News Daily Report\u2019. Similar news items were in circulation from the last 5 years and have already found to be untrue. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen you look for any such news on Google using keywords \u20185-meter tall human skeleton unearthed\u2019, an article with the title similar to the description in the post (i.e. \u20185-METER TALL HUMAN SKELETON UNEARTHED IN AUSTRALIA\u2019) is found in the search results. The website (\u2018World News Daily Report\u2019) which published that article is a satirical website. The description of the website at the bottom of the page reads, \u201cWorld News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website \u2013 even those based on real people \u2013 are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.\u201d So, the news published by it should not be taken seriously. Further, the image found in the article is actually that of a mammoth skeleton found at site in Changis-sur-Marne, east of Paris in France.\n\nAlso, the website published an article regarding the same site in 2013 with a different narrative of finding ruins of a lost city. Both the articles have been already fact-checked by different organizations when the news went viral in the previous years\n\nTo sum it up, a 5-meter human skeleton has not been unearthed in Australia. It is a satirical post turned hoax.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
