So, obviously, that would include heating costs, making Harris\u2019s original language overstated. Two different analyses of census data \u2014 by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Joint Center for Housing Studies \u2014 have found that 11 million rental households paid more than half their income on housing costs.\n\n\u201cNon-Hispanic black women experience maternal deaths at a rate three to four times that of non-Hispanic white women, a racial disparity that is mirrored across many maternal and infant outcomes,\u201d the report said. \u201cNearly 50 percent of all pregnancy-related deaths were caused by hemorrhage, cardiovascular and coronary conditions, cardiomyopathy, or infection. . . . Preeclampsia and eclampsia, and embolism were leading underlying causes of death among non-Hispanic black women.\u201d The report said that more than 60 percent of the pregnancy-related deaths were preventable.\n\nThe figures on New York City come from a study that looked at pregnancy-related mortality in the city between 2006 and 2010. \u201cBlack, non-Hispanic women were 12 times more likely than White, non-Hispanic women to die from pregnancy-related causes between 2006 and 2010,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis represents a widening of the pregnancy-related mortality gap since the period from 2001 to 2005, when the mortality risk was seven times greater among Black, non-Hispanic women.\u201d The figures are a bit dated, but a report on 2011-2015 data is pending.\n\nOne reason the farmer\u2019s share is declining is that foods today involve a higher degree of processing or special handing \u2014 and the more processing involved, the smaller the return for farmers. As an example, eggs require little processing before they are sold \u2014 they just end up in a carton \u2014 so farmers in the early 2000s received almost 58 percent of the marketing bill, compared with the then-average of 17.8 percent for the farm share. But farmers received only 8.3 percent of the marketing bill for cereals and baked goods. USDA once estimated that a $1 loaf of bread contains about 5 cents worth of wheat.\n\nUSDA also divides the dollar by industry. Under this metric, farm production receives only 7.8 cents of the dollar. The gap between 14.6 cents and 7.8 cents indicates that farms spent 6.8 cents of the money they earned to purchase products from the other industry groups. (After all, even farmers may eat at McDonald\u2019s.) Since Warren used the phrasing about how much of the agriculture dollars \u201cwent into a farmer\u2019s pocket,\u201d the lower number of 7.8 cents may be more appropriate than 15 cents. (Even this figure, however, does not account for 1.4 cents that must go to hire labor, so the amount going into \u201cthe farmer\u2019s pocket\u201d is even lower.)", "lang": "en"}
