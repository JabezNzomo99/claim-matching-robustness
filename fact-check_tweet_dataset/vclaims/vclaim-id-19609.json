Galvan, 35 and Teresa Vance, 31, arrested at a Trump rally for literally handing out shit sandwiches? No, that's not true: a fake story making that claim was being spread by a website connected to a network of fake news sites that has been dormant for a while but which seems to have woken up again. There is no truth to the story.\n\nThe story originated from an article published on July 25, 2018 by a website at yahoonews-us.com falsely claiming to be Yahoo! News. The story was titled \"Kentucky Couple charged after handing out free sandwiches containing their own feces at Trump rally\" (archived here) and it opened:\n\nA Kentucky couple has been arrested and charged after giving out free sandwiches filled with their own feces to unsuspecting President Trump supporters at a local rally.\n\nThe incident is said to have taken place in Paducah, Kentucky over the weekend. According to witnesses, Joseph P. Galvan, 35 and Teresa Vance, 31, were handing out free sandwiches and bottles of water to the crowd. \"Everyone thought that it was a really nice gesture\", said one pro-Trump supporter who did not want to be named. \"I then saw a few people start to gag and vomit after eating them. We originally thought they may have just gone off or something, but when you opened them up it was pretty clear by the smell they contained feces\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail and they may have confused it for a real Yahoo! News story:\n\nThe Paducah police department has already denied the story was true:\n\nThe statement they put out read:\n\nIt has been brought to our attention that a \"fake news\" story is circulating on social media regarding the arrest of two people for passing out sandwiches containing human feces last weekend at a Trump rally in Paducah. The article goes so far as to quote Chief of Police Brandon Barnhill. There is no truth to the article. There was no rally, there were no arrests, and Chief Barnhill did not speak to a reporter or provide a quote. If you see the article, please do not repost or share it. It's a bunch of poop and the whole article stinks.\n\n\ud83d\ude06\n\nWe wrote about yahoonews-us.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: McDonald's Did NOT Announce They're Permanently Removing The Big Mac From Their Menu\n\nThe site that put out the hoax is connected to several other fake news sites all mimicking several well known media brands:\n\nSome of these sites in turn are connected to a larger network that went offline about nine months ago:\n\nEntire Network Of Fake News Websites Vanishes In Wake Of Mandalay Bay Hoax | Lead Stories An entire network of fake news websites designed to look like local news outlets has vanished without a trace.
