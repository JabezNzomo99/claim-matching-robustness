We checked.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2013, the year the president took office, the Kenyan economy grew 5.9%, and 5.4% in 2014, according to data from the national statistics office.\n\nshows economic growth was 5.7% in 2015, 5.9% in 2016 and 4.9% in 2017.\n\nThe average over those five years works out to 5.56%. We therefore rate the president\u2019s figure as correct. -Alphonce Shiundu\n\nKenyatta said the rate the Kenyan economy grew at had outpaced the world.\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s\n\nupdate in January 2019, the world economy grew 3.7% in 2018, a slight dip from 3.8% in 2017.\n\nshows global growth was 3.2% in both\n\nin 2014. In 2013 this\n\n. This averages to 3.36% between 2013 and 2017, which is well under Kenya\u2019s growth that same period. The figures appear to bear the president out.\n\nBut there\u2019s more. Is Kenya doing better than the rest of the world? We asked Kwame Owino, the\n\nof think tank the\n\n'Compare ourselves with our peers'\n\nThe numbers are expected, Kwame said. This is because mature economies grow at a slower rate, having exhausted the capital and gains they can get from technology. But the US with 2% growth still created significantly more wealth than Kenya did with a 5.6% growth rate.\n\nKenya therefore needed to grow even faster to close the public welfare gap, Kwame said. But the broader comparison distorts the picture.\n\n\u201cIt is misleading. We should compare our growth rates with our peers, people within our range,\u201d Kwame said.\n\nFor instance, according to World Bank\n\n, in eastern Africa, over the last five years, Kenya\u2019s economy has been growing faster than Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, but slower compared to Tanzania and Ethiopia.\n\nin 2018. This is according to the national treasury\u2019s\n\nThe economy grew 5.8% in the first three months of 2018, 6.2% in the second quarter and 6% in the third quarter of the year. This, the\n\nsaid, was due to \u201cfavourable weather conditions and a stable macroeconomic environment\u201d.\n\n\u2013 a non-partisan office that advises lawmakers on the economy -\n\nIn a forecast the same month, the\n\nfor the year. This would be due to \u201crecovery in agriculture, better business sentiment, and easing of political uncertainty\u201d.\n\nFor the economy to grow at 6.1%, growth for the last quarter will need to come in at 6.4%. But given the proximity of the other forecasts to the president\u2019s figure, which he noted was provisional, we rate this claim as mostly correct.\n\nof the president\u2019s speech gave the number of connections as 2.264 million in March 2013 and 7.029 million in March 2019. But when he spoke he said \u201c2.2 million\u201d and \u201c7.1 million\u201d.\n\nsays it had an estimated 6.76 million customers connected to electricity. An earlier report says there were\n\ncustomers at the end of June 2013.\n\nKevin Sang, a spokesperson for Kenya power, told Africa Check the latest figures were 7 million customers connected to power.\n\nWhat the president actually said is therefore mostly correct\n\nKenyatta said clean energy plants had helped increase capacity, with wind projects in Lake Turkana and Ngong and a solar project in Garissa joining the grid in 2018.\n\nin June 2013 at 1,765 MW. By June 2018 it had risen to 2,351 MW, according to\n\n\u201cAccording to our latest figures, the installed capacity is now 2,712 MW, while the effective capacity is 2,638 MW,\u201d Kenya Power spokesperson Kevin Sang told Africa Check on 5 April 2019, the day after Kenyatta\u2019s State of the Nation Address.We therefore rate the claim as correct.\n\nprovided for the creation of 47 county governments. The law provides for equitable sharing of money with the counties of \u201cnot less than 15%\u201d of all revenue collected by the national government.\n\nThe Division of Revenue Acts show the total allocations to county governments were KSh 1.76 trillion. However, not all this money was actually transferred.\n\nThe sums actually sent to the counties\n\nThe treasury releases money to the county governments' accounts, but the controller of budget then finalises the transfer by allowing the counties to access the money.\n\nThe amount transferred to the counties as per the latest available figure is KSh1,503.87. The president\u2019s amount is thus off by KSh190 billion. We therefore rate the claim\n\nIn 2017, some 699,055 passengers travelled on the train, according to December 2018\n\n.They brought in receipts of KSh627 million.\n\nIn 2018, revised official data showed that the train carried 1,665,627 passengers, bringing in KSh1.6 billion in revenue. This, Rosemary Bowen, an official with the statistics agency, told Africa Check.\n\nThe first two months of 2019 recorded 226,027 passengers. Since its launch in May 2018 the train has carried 2,590,709 passengers and earned revenue of KSh2.5 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis number of passengers also counts repeat passengers, Bowen said. \u201cIt is not unique passengers.\u201d In November 2018, a passenger recognised as the\n\npassenger said she was a frequent user of the service.\n\nData from the national bureau of statistics showed that 5 million tonnes of cargo had been moved by December 2018 - about 1.1 million tonnes of cargo more than the President stated.\n\nWe asked about the discrepancy. The agency said the data had been revised. Transportation of cargo did not start\n\n. That year, the cargo service moved 2.9 million tonnes, earning revenue of KSh4.1 billion. In the first two months of 2019 some 662,419 tonnes of cargo were transported.\n\nThis brought the total to 3.6 million tonnes. With March 2019 not accounted for, we rate the president\u2019s number of 3.8 million tonnes as mostly correct.\n\nProviding affordable housing is a key priority for Kenyatta\u2019s legacy. As part of this, the president noted that more than 175,000 Kenyans have registered for a plan to allocate houses.\n\nallows them and their employers to contribute some of their income, up to a maximum of KSh2,500 a month. There\u2019s also a voluntary contribution that is not capped.\n\nWhen the building of houses starts, the applicants\n\nthrough a \u201cregular, fair and transparent system free of any human intervention and contact\u201d be allocated houses. This will depend on a number of factors such as when they listed, \u201cfamily status as well as demand across the housing categories\u201d.\n\nAs of 4 April 2019 there were\n\nregistered applicants. While this is 11,000 more people, it is \u201cover 175,000\u201d. The president actually missed the chance to announce a larger figure. - Alphonce Shiundu\n\nAccording to the\n\n, MSMEs as they are known are enterprises \u201chaving between 1 and 99 employees\u201d.\n\nMicro-enterprises have less than 10 employees; small enterprises have between 10 and 49 employees while medium-sized enterprises have between 50 to 99 employees.\n\nThe survey, from the\n\n, showed these businesses employ 14, 898,300 people. Some 42.2% of the businesses were licensed while 57.8% were unlicensed.\n\nThe president\u2019s claim is correct based on the most recently available public data. -\n\nThis claim stems from a 2017 campaign promise to achieve a 100% transition rate from primary to secondary school by providing free secondary education . According to the economic survey 2018, the transition rate in 2017 was 83.1%.A recent education ministry report puts the rate at 93.14% on 22 February 2019. In March Amina Mohammed, then the cabinet secretary for education, tweeted that the transition rate was \u201c93% and rising\u201d.The rise from 83.1% to 93.14% can be attributed to the free-day high school subsidy, and the work of provincial administration \u2013 chiefs and their assistants \u2013 to ensure all students who sit their final primary school exam get into secondary school. This is according to Amos Kaburu from Uwezo , a literacy and numeracy programme at Twaweza East Africa Dr John Mugo, who has researched education in Kenya , said that while the transition rate had risen, it was unlikely to have reached 100%.First, he said, secondary education is not fully compulsory, as no law forced parents to ensure their children go to high school. It\u2019s also not completely free. There are still direct costs such as for uniforms, transport and food. And the opportunity cost \u2013 the loss of possible income and domestic labour provided by children \u2013 is not considered.Providing free tuition without also giving legislative and other support to parents in different social contexts would not guarantee a 100% transition rate, Mugo told Africa Check. -Alphonce ShiunduThe president flagged off the maiden passenger train on the standard gauge railway in May 2017 , not May 2018 as in his speech. through at no costhttps://africacheck.org/reports/uhuru-kenyattas-2018-state-of-the-nation-address-fact-checked/", "lang": "en"}
