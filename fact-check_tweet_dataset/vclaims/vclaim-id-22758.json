It wasn't us who started this war, it wasn't us. But it's our job to end it. And we're ready for a dialogue,\u201d Zelenskiy said.\n\nThe head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, used the Telegram messaging service to express discontent with Zelenskiy\u2019s statement, the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported.\n\nKadyrov said Zelenskiy\u2019s inauguration speech had likely been \u201cedited abroad,\u201d otherwise he \u201cwould not be making belligerent statements on the first day\u201d of his presidency \u201cthreatening to seize the territory of a neighboring state.\u201d\n\nThe Chechen leader was referring to the Crimean peninsula, which he said \"was, is, and forever will be an integral part of Russia.\"\n\nPolygraph.info has repeatedly checked false claims that Russia is not occupying Ukrainian territory.\n\nBut did Zelensky threaten to take any territory, neighboring or otherwise, by force?\n\nThe Ukrainian president did say that, after ending the war in the Donbas, the next challenge was \u201cthe return of [Ukraine\u2019s] lost territories,\u201d adding that it was \u201cimpossible to lose something that rightfully belongs to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth Crimea and [the Donbas region] are Ukrainian lands. We didn't just lose the territories, we lost the most important thing: the people,\u201d Zelensky said.\n\nThat opinion was backed up by the March 27, 2014 United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68/262. It stated that the Russian-led referendum to annex Crimea, carried out under military occupation, had \u201cno validity\u201d and \u201ccannot form the basis for any alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or of the city of Sevastopol.\u201d\n\nThe resolution urged all countries \u201cnot to recognize any alteration of the status\u201d of Crimea, which the majority of the international community has adhered to.\n\nWhile Zelenskiy spoke of winning back the \u201cconscience\u201d of the people in those areas whom the government had failed to make \u201cfeel Ukrainian,\u201d he did not suggest \u201cseizing\u201d Crimea or otherwise regaining the peninsula via military action.\n\nPolygraph.info therefore finds Kadyrov\u2019s statement to be false.", "lang": "en"}
