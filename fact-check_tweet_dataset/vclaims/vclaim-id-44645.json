Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Image of a Shivalinga unearthed during the excavations for Ram temple construction at Ayodhya.

As per this article, the Shivalinga in the image is related to a temple in Farrukhabad (Uttar Pradesh).\n\nIt is true that during the recent excavations at Ayodhya Ram temple construction site, the remains of ancient temples such as pillars, idols of deities and a Shivalinga were found.
