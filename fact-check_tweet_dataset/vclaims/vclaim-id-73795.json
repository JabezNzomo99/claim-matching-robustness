Can u blame him?!\u201d\n\nThe resignation document with the letterhead \u2018Office of the Special Assistant to the Executive Governor of Kano State on Graveyards\u2019 was included in the tweet.\n\nIn less than 24 hours, the tweet has garnered 137 retweets and generated 55 comments and lead to several similar posts made by other accounts with reactions.\n\nThe reactions generally border on disbelief that a position for a special assistant on graveyards exists. Some of the reactions also questioned the timeline of the resignation.\n\nClaim 1: That there is an office of the special assistant to the executive governor of Kano state on graveyards.\n\nClaim 2: That Yakubu Nagoda just resigned as as special assistant to Governor Umar Ganduje on graveyards.\n\nA look at the date on the attached document shows August 4, 2018.\n\nIn addition a search of the document using the TinEye tool \u2013 an app that allows for reverse searches on images \u2013 showed that it appeared on the internet as far back as August 2018.\n\nWithin the same period, Legit, an online newspaper reported the same story and embedded the resignation document on the published report. The Cable and BBC Pidgin also had similar reports with the same document.\n\nThis means Odinkalu made his Twitter post almost two years after it actually happened and he presented it as something recent. For instance, he said, \u201cThe man is tired. Can u blame him.\u201d\n\nThe Kano state Commissioner for Information, Mohammed Garba confirmed to the ICIR that the Office of the special assistant to the executive governor of Kano state on graveyards exists within the period in question.\n\nIn a phone interview with The ICIR on Tuesday, August 11, Garba said that the office existed between 2015 to 2019 but no new appointment has been made since the governor returned for his second term in office.\n\nGarba said \u201cThe office existed in the last 2015 \u2013 2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no new appointment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Governor is yet to appoint anyone to that office.\u201d\n\nGanduje is the current governor of Kano state. He was re-elected for a second term in 2019. After finishing his first tenure which lasted from 2015 to 2019.\n\nThe ICIR also reached out to Nagoda, the aide who was said to have resigned and in a phone interview on August 12 confirmed submitting the resignation letter.\n\nThe letter had initially gone viral in 2018, before resurfacing in 2020.\n\nNagoda speaking Hausa language told the ICIR \u201cIt is true. I gave the letter when I was leaving.\u201d\n\nThe ICIR called and sent a text message to Professor Odinkalu for comment but he has not responded as at the time of filing this report.\n\nBased on the information presented the claim that there is an office of the special assistant to the executive governor of Kano state on graveyards is TRUE.\n\nWhile it is true that Nagoda resigned as special assistant on graveyards to Ganduje, He did that two years ago. The presentation of the tweet as something that recently happened is MISLEADING.", "lang": "en"}
