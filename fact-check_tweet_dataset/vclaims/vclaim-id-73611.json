The claim appears to have originated on a satirical Facebook page.\n\nThe post claims that scientists discovered Devils Tower was originally a giant tree after \u201cconducting photographic seismic readings\u201d that allegedly revealed an \u201cincredibly large petrified root system\u201d underneath the butte. It further alleges that the Wyoming State Parks Department put out a statement announcing the supposed discovery.\n\nDevils Tower, a natural formation located in Wyoming, was declared the U.S.\u2019s first national monument in 1906, according to the National Park Service (NPS). The NPS states on its website that Devils Tower receives roughly 500,000 visitors a year.\n\n\u201cWe have discovered, what looks like a giant root system stemming from the base of The Devils Tower,\u201d reads the purported statement from the Wyoming State Parks Department. \u201cThe root system has been measured at 4 miles deep by 7 miles wide.\u201d\n\nBut Check Your Fact found no credible media reports about such a discovery. The alleged statement does not appear on the Wyoming State Parks, Historic Sites and Trails\u2019 website or its social media posts.

The butte is made up of igneous rock called phonolite porphyry, per National Geographic.\n\nThe claim seems to stem from a satirical 2017 post on the Facebook page Casper Planet. The Facebook page\u2019s \u201cAbout\u201d section states, \u201cDelivering the Snews that doesn\u2019t matter directly to your Snews feed. Satire, humor, and opinion, names/locations are made up.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
