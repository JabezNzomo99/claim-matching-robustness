Let\u2019s try to analyze the claims made in the post.\n\nClaim: An RTI reveals that on an average, 80 lakh rupees is paid every month to the beauticians of Modi. Fact: No RTI declaring the payments to Modi\u2019s beauticians was found. Moreover, the video posted is related to the visit of Madame Tussauds team to take body measurements of Modi for making his wax statue. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nOn playing the video, at the 0:03 secs, the name of \u2018Madame Tussauds\u2019 on the makeup box and at the 0:08 secs, the document bearing the name of \u2018Madame Tussauds\u2019 as its title can be seen. With the information available, when searched on YouTube, a 2016 video recording of Madame Tussauds\u2019 London team taking the body measurements of Modi for making his wax statue will be found.\n\nIn the video, some persons can be seen applying makeup to Modi. They are actually the members of Madame Tussauds team, not the beauticians as portrayed in the post.\n\nAlso, when searched for any RTI details on the Modi\u2019s make-up expenses, no results were found. Finally, the video posted is a recording of the Madame Tussauds team taking body dimensions of Modi.", "lang": "en"}
