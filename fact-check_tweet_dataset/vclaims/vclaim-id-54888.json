The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) state there is currently no cure for the disease.\n\nThe video shows two individuals in a small kitchen: one person leaning over the stove with a blanket covering his or her head and a woman speaking to the camera. The woman said that the other person is using an \u201cAfrican remedy\u201d to cure COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\n\u201cTurmeric powder, ginger, garlic and lemon \u2014 we cooked all these together and we steamed our head with it,\u201d the woman said. \u201cCoronavirus can\u2019t get us. We know the African remedy.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation found no scientific evidence that inhaling steam infused with these ingredients can prevent or cure the coronavirus infection. Claims that consuming ginger, garlic or lemon in some form can prevent COVID-19 have circulated online for weeks and been thoroughly debunked by fact-checkers.\n\n\u201cA little warm moisture is not going to hurt these viruses,\u201d Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University, told The Associated Press. \u201cPeople need to be very, very careful about this. You can have all kinds of misadventures if you are leaning over a pot of boiling water.\u201d\n\nNeither the WHO nor the CDC recommends this tactic on their respective websites. The WHO noted that while some home remedies might alleviate COVID-19 symptoms, there is no evidence they can prevent or cure the disease.\n\nThe internet is replete with false claims that certain home or traditional remedies can cure the new coronavirus.

Some of these purported remedies include herbal therapies and teas,\u201d reads a report from the National Institutes of Health. \u201cThere is no scientific evidence that any of these alternative remedies can prevent or cure COVID-19. In fact, some of them may not be safe to consume.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
