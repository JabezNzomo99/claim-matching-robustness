Some of the claims seem a little outlandish. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- A Female Physician in Munich, Germany sends a message to the world ... Yesterday, at the hospital we had a meeting about how the situation here and at the other Munich hospitals is unsustainable. Clinics cannot handle emergencies, so they are starting to send everything to the hospitals. Many Muslims are refusing treatment by female staff and, we, women, are refusing to go among those animals, especially from Africa. Relations between the staff and migrants are going from bad to worse. Since last weekend, migrants going to the hospitals must be accompanied by police withMany migrants have AIDS, syphilis, open TB and many exotic diseases that we, in Europe, do not know how to treat them. If they receive a prescription in the pharmacy, they learn they have to pay cash. This leads to unbelievable outbursts, especially when it is about drugs for the children. They abandon the children with pharmacy staff with the words: \u201cSo, cure them here yourselves!\u201d So the police are not just guarding the clinics and hospitals, but also large pharmacies. Truly we said openly: Where are all those who had welcomed in front of TV cameras, with signs at train stations?! Yes, for now, the border has been closed, but a million of them are already here and we will definitely not be able to get rid of them. Until now, the number of unemployed in Germany was 2.2 million. Now it will be at leastMost of these people are completely unemployable. A bare minimum of them have any education. What is more, their women usually do not work at all. I estimate that one in ten is pregnant. Hundreds of thousands of them have brought along infants and little kids under six, many emaciated and neglected. If this continues and German re-opens its borders, I\u2019m going home to the Czech Republic. Nobody can keep me here in this situation, not even double the salary than at home. I went to Germany, not to Africa or the Middle East. Even the professor who heads our department told us how sad it makes him to see the cleaning woman, who for 800 Euros cleans every day for years, and then meets young men in the hallways who just wait with their hand outstretched, want everything for free, and when they don\u2019t get it they throw a fit. I really don\u2019t need this! But I\u2019m afraid that if I return, that at some point it will be the same in the Czech Republic. If the Germans, with their nature cannot handle this, there in Czechia it would be total chaos. Nobody who has not come in contact with them has no idea what kind of animals they are, especially the ones from Africa, and how Muslims act superior to our staff, regarding their religious accommodation. For now, the local hospital staff has not come down with the diseases they brought here, but, with so many hundreds of patients every day \u2014 this is just a question of time. In a hospital near the Rhine, migrants attacked the staff with knives after they had handed over an 8-month-old on the brink of death, which they had dragged across half of Europe for three months. The child died in two days, despite having received top care at one of the best pediatric clinics in Germany. The physician had to undergo surgery and two nurses are laid up in the ICU. Nobody has been punished. The local press is forbidden to write about it, so we know about it through email. What would have happened to a German if he had stabbed a doctor and nurses with a knife? Or if he had flung his own syphilis-infected urine into a nurse\u2019s face and so threatened her with infection? At a minimum he\u2019d go straight to jail and later to court. With these people \u2014 so far, nothing has happened. And so I ask, where are all those greeters and receivers from the train stations? Sitting pretty at home, enjoying their non-profits and looking forward to more trains and their next batch of cash from acting like greeters at the stations. If it were up to me I would round up all these greeters and bring them here first to our hospital\u2019s emergency ward, as attendants. Then, into one building with the migrants so they can look after them there themselves, without armed police, without police dogs who today are in every hospital here in Bavaria, and without medical help.\n\nOn 8 October 2015, the web site The Right Scoop published the above-reproduced missive as an article headlined \u201cMUST WATCH: Whistleblower Doctor Explains HORRIFIC Reality Dealing with Muslim Invaders in Germany\u201d \u2014 not long afterwards, verbatim versions of the same commentary began circulating in an e-mail frequently titled \u201cA Female Physician in Munich, Germany Sends a Warning Message to The World\u2026\u201d The Right Scoop claimed credit for transcribing the letter from the video embedded above; but whether that translation is an accurate one is unclear. A longer version of the same clip was uploaded to YouTube on 6 October 2015, and both clips began with what appeared to be repetition of an older rumor involving refugees and Oktoberfest.\n\nThe source of the missive was apparently an on-air reading by a Czech newscaster, who recited what was said to be a letter from a Czech doctor treating immigrants in a German hospital. Its assertions were a blend of difficult-to-verify first-person claims and opinion (mixed with a measure of undiluted misinformation), its purported author was an unnamed \u201cfemale physician,\u201d and a handful of its talking points were claims about incidents at an unidentified Munich hospital in the weeks following an influx of Middle Eastern refugees to Germany in September 2015. (The piece was almost certainly veiled criticism of German citizens who had welcomed asylum-seekers with open arms a few weeks prior to its circulation.)\n\nLike earlier polemics written from the perspective of an authority figure, the occupation of the writer served to bolster the e-mail\u2019s claims and lend credibility to them \u2014 it\u2019s difficult to imagine the item\u2019s gaining such traction had it been the perspective of a barista or dog walker. The claims contained in the letter were not dated (making it easier for them to circulate in perpetuity), so verifying even the scant collection of non-opinion statements offered in the e-mail is difficult.\n\nIn its first portion the writer claimed that \u201cMuslims\u201d had \u201crefused\u201d to be treated by female doctors (and that \u201cand, we, women, are refusing to go among those animals, especially from Africa\u201d):\n\nAIDS, syphilis, and tuberculosis are hardly diseases modern doctors would consider \u201cexotic,\u201d and it beggars belief that anyone (particularly a \u201cphysician\u201d) would claim medical professionals \u201cdon\u2019t know how to treat them.\u201d There\u2019s some truth to the assertion Muslim men might eschew care from female doctors, as a 2010 New York Times article explained:\n\nHowever, that same piece also covered the larger issue of patient comfort and bedside manner; and open contempt for patients (as expressed by the putative author of the letter from a Munich hospital) is unusual in medical settings, where most doctors and nurses are accustomed to providing care to all, whether or not those interactions are pleasant.\n\nUntil now, the number of unemployed in Germany was 2.2 million. Now it will be at least 3.5 million. Most of these people are completely unemployable. A bare minimum of them have any education. What is more, their women usually do not work at all. I estimate that one in ten is pregnant. Hundreds of thousands of them have brought along infants and little kids under six, many emaciated and neglected. If this continues and German re-opens its borders, I\u2019m going home to the Czech Republic. Nobody can keep me here in this situation, not even double the salary than at home. I went to Germany, not to Africa or the Middle East.\n\nAs of July 2015 there were an estimated 2.8 million people registered as unemployed in Germany, and the author didn\u2019t cite any source for predictions that number would rise to 3.5 million based on an influx of asylum seekers. The \u201cone in 10 is pregnant\u201d figure is an admitted estimation by the e-mail\u2019s writer, for which we could find no corroborating evidence (and it further stands to reason that pregnant refugees would seek medical care with higher frequency than women in general, for obvious reasons). However, it should be noted that that overall claim deviated significantly from other popular refugee rumors which consistently described those seeking asylum as predominantly men of \u201cfighting age.\u201d\n\nThe missive went on to state:\n\nFor now, the local hospital staff has not come down with the diseases they brought here, but, with so many hundreds of patients every day \u2014 this is just a question of time. In a hospital near the Rhine, migrants attacked the staff with knives after they had handed over an 8-month-old on the brink of death, which they had dragged across half of Europe for three months. The child died in two days, despite having received top care at one of the best pediatric clinics in Germany. The physician had to undergo surgery and two nurses are laid up in the ICU. Nobody has been punished.\n\nThe notion that spikes in immigration lead to outbreaks of disease is a common theme among rumors that circulate during crises that drive large numbers of people out of a given area. Media speculation about such public health concerns inevitably follows; but (as the author conceded) those predictions have not come to pass in connection with Syrian refugees. We were unable to find any news reports that any hospital workers near the Rhine had been attacked by refugees at any point in 2015 in the manner described by the author.\n\nPrecisely what \u201cit\u201d the \u201clocal press [was] forbidden\u201d to report was left to the reader\u2019s preconceptions (presumably the alleged attacks on medical personnel by immigrants); but news coverage about the ongoing refugee crisis wasn\u2019t subject to any blackout or other restriction (as attested to by comprehensive global news coverage of the situation). The author seemed to hint that similar e-mails were the source for the claims, accounts that proliferate on social media but don\u2019t appear in the news. However, the reason for the absence of such accounts from the news media is far more likely their dubious credibility than any sort of censorship of reporting, which itself creates a self-propelling narrative of widespread suppression.\n\nThe author of this missive concluded:\n\nThe writer seems to suggest as a footnote that the crowds of Germans who warmly received refugees weeks earlier were paid by unnamed parties, insinuating that the sole motivation for their display of welcome was financial. As it stands, no one has stepped forward to claim authorship of the popular polemic; and a number of its assertions are shaky, unsupported, or simply opinion-based (such as the repeated description of African people as \u201canimals\u201d). Were there any truth to its claims, there\u2019s no demonstrable reason why that information would be subject to a \u201cblackout\u201d of any description; and even the conspiracy-level censorship alleged by the writing would be unlikely to stop such reports from reaching the world at large through social media and blogs.\n\nVariations: The name of Dr. Barbara Sziraki has since become attached to this message, but she appears to be a Los Angeles psychologist who simply forwarded the letter via e-mail and not a Czech physician working in Germany.", "lang": "en"}
