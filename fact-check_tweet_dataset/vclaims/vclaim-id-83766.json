We now work full-time in France, the Philippines, Indonesia, Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, Canada, India, Pakistan, Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria, Senegal, as well as with the news agency\u2019s network of more than 1,500 journalists worldwide.\n\nAFP journalists have written about diverse subjects, from immigration to sport, politics, the environment or science, dealing with serious, not so serious and sometimes complex issues.\n\nAFP fact-checkers have written 654 articles in the past year: 37 percent in French and 37 percent in English, 16 percent in Spanish and 10 percent in Portuguese.\n\nWe wrote our first fact check in French on November 22, 2017, in Spanish on June 7, 2018, in English on June 15, 2018 and in Portuguese on June 21, 2018.\n\nAFP is a member of the International Fact-Checking Network and Firstdraft, and has worked on collaborative verification projects around elections in France, with Crosscheck, and Brazil, with Comprova.\n\nAFP is the only media organisation, apart from Africa Check, to focus on fact-checking in several African countries and languages.\n\nWe use traditional journalistic research skills as well as advanced internet and social network search tools, such as the INVID plugin, co-developed by AFP.\n\nTo mark our first year of fact-checking, we asked our fact-checkers to choose a favourite story to highlight. Here are their statements:\n\nApril 26, 2018 \"No, this Syrian girl isn't part of a staged scene or a survivor of several attacks\" \"AFP wasn't the first to debunk this photomontage which used pictures by one of our freelancers in Syria and has been shared repeatedly over two years. But thanks to the metadata, we were the first to provide irrefutable proof that the three pictures of a shell-shocked girl were taken on the same day, in the same place, within less than two minutes. There's nothing surprising about a young victim being passed between the arms of different rescuers after a bombing. But many suggested the scene was set up, accusing the girl of being part of some kind of plot.\" AFP published a first fact check in French on November 22, 2017\n\nSeptember 18, 2018 \"No, not all Trident chewing gum sold in Pakistan is haram\".\n\n\"This was a viral story that had been circulating in Pakistan for many years. Halal food is a very important issue for Muslim-majority Pakistan, but there is hardly any documentation about what is or isn't halal, so similar rumours and controversies keep swirling around. \"\n\nAFP published a first fact check from Pakistan on July 14, 2018\n\nSeptember 19, 2018 \"No, an elephant was not photographed carrying a lion cub in its trunk\" \"Not all false information is deliberately created to fool people. Sometimes it can be a joke that's been misunderstood or shared too quickly online, where a good story always does well. The story of an elephant carrying a lion cub in its trunk, for example. The image was created as an April fool by a South African wildlife park, but shared by more than one hundred thousand accounts lauding the beauty of the animal kingdom. Although it wasn't deliberately misleading, the debunk was a chance for us to illustrate free tools to identify fake images, which can sometimes be much more harmful.\" AFP published a first fact check in French on November 22, 2017\n\n\"The fact-check on fictitious LGBT groups apparently endorsing a presidential candidate in Nigeria was fun and interesting to me for numerous reasons. Pressure groups urging politicians to back policies on the basis of region, ethnicity or religion is a common theme within Nigerian media and a suspicious one. It was interesting too because of how perceived hostile attitudes to LGBTQ+ people seemed to be deliberately politicised. Ahead of the Nigerian elections, it is also a small window into the misinformation likely to come as the campaigns intensify.\"\n\nAFP published a first fact check from Nigeria on October 17, 2018\n\nNovember 8, 2018 \"No, this is not a photo of breastfeeding students in Kenya\" \"This fact-check is my favourite so far because in Kenya teenage pregancy especially during national exams is something that is widely reported on. Local media houses focus on reporting this and counteless unverified photos are normally shared on social media to depict that it is a dire situation.\n\n\n\n This photo was specifially shared to fool many who viewed it that in a class of 57 candidates (30 girls and 27 boys), 21 girls all below 19 years are breastfeeding mothers.\n\n\n\n I was intrigued after fact-checking it to find out that the school in the post does not even exist in Nyanza region and the photo was from a Tanzanian school.\n\n\n\n This particular story was mentioned during BBC's Beyond FakeNews conference which I attended here in Nairobi, Kenya.\" AFP published a first fact check from Kenya on October 26, 2018\n\n\"I particularly enjoyed debunking disinformation around the \"It's okay to be white\" poster campaign because there were several layers to the story. By looking into false claims that Canadian Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan had tweeted that whites have no place in Canada, I realized the scale of the campaign to which the minister was actually referring to, and how coordinated it had been. All of the conversations surrounding the logistics of the campaign were still online, and they highlighted its intentions: to discredit those who would denounce the campaign in order to expose a supposed bias and, in the case of the United States, to subsequently influence votes during the November 8 Midterm elections.\"\n\nAFP published a first fact check from Canada on June 26, 2018\n\nNovember 12, 2018 : \"No, the Chinese are not opening police stations in South Africa\" \"In South Africa, where the presence of Chinese nationals is estimated at around 300,000, conversations around the false headline showed locals believed that not only were the Chinese moving into the country in large numbers, but that this warranted the need for 14 of their own police stations - very different from the community cooperation centres that they actually are.\" AFP published a first fact check from South Africa on November 12, 2018 The first names of fact checkers in certain countries were not used for security reasons", "lang": "en"}
