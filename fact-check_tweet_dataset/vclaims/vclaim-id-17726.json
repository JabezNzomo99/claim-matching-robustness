The same caption has been added as text on the video and is being shared on WhatsApp too.\n\nThe one minute and thirty-seven-seconds long video, shows a group of around 100 men standing near a statue and shouting slogans such in Hindi. The group shouts slogans like \"Hindustan hamara hain\" (India is ours), \"Narendra Modi hai hai\" (Down with Narendra Modi), \"Shiv Sena hai hai\" (Down with Shiv Sena), \"Bajrang Dal hai hai\"(Down with Bajrang Dal) \"Hindustan mein rehna hoga, Allah-u-Akbar kehna hoga\" (If you want to stay in Hindustan, you have to chant Allah Hu Akbar) and \"Bhagwa atankwaad band karo (Stop saffron terrorism).\n\nBOOM analysed the video and found that the video was shot on December 8, 2017 in Udaipur at the Chetak Circle in the city. (Read more about the video here) The rally was held by Muslim communities in Udaipur to protest against Shambulal Regar, who brutally murdered Mohammed Afrazul, a Muslim labourer.\n\nThe murder made headlines across the country as Regar recorded the barbaric crime on camera and justified the killing. (Read more about it here)\n\nA screengrab from the video where Shambulal Regar brutally hacked a Muslim labourer to death.\n\nFollowing the video of Regar, tensions prevailed in Rajasthan and a temporary internet ban was also placed in parts of the city to curb rumours. The incident, also sparked anger among the Muslim community in the state who held protests in various places and also led to Hindu groups holding counter protests.\n\nBOOM was also able to find the same video on YouTube dating back to December 2017 witth many local Hindi language news channels also reporting on the story.", "lang": "en"}
