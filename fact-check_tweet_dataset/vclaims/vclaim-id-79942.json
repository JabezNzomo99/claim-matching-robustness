The claim is false; the photograph actually shows a section of the Ledo-Burma Road, also known as the Stilwell Road, in southeast China.\n\nThe post, which was first published May 22, 2016 and has been shared more than 123,000 times since, show a photo of a very bendy road which it claims is in the Philippines.\n\nThe caption, when translated to English, says: \u201cHey, people from Bicol! Doesn\u2019t it cause dizziness to pass through here. One needs Bonamin always. Hahahaha. CHICKEN ENTRAILS at Atimonan Quezon.\u201d\n\nBonamin is a reference to an over the counter medicine used to treat motion sickness and vertigo.\n\nBITUKANG MANOK or \u201cchicken entrails\u201d is a reference to a stretch of the national highway known for hairpin bends that runs through the mountainous Quezon National Park on the Bicol peninsula.\n\nThe photo has also been posted with the same caption here and here.\n\nA reverse image search using Baidu found that the exact same photo as is used in the misleading image appears in this 2016 report credited to the Guizhou Daily newspaper, a Mandarin-language publication for southeast China\u2019s Guizhou province.\n\nThe article is headlined: \u201cGuizhou: making the province a destination for both sport and ethnic tourism\u201d.\n\nThe caption of the photograph says when translated to English: \"Stilwell Road\u2019s 24-Zig in Qinglong county, staging a car climbing race.\"\n\nMore images of the 24-Zig road can be seen here on this official Qinglong county government website, with the headline \u201cThe bend of history: Qinglong\u2019s 24-Zig road.\u201d\n\nAccording to this announcement also posted on the Qinglong county\u2019s government website, the road is closed to vehicle traffic for protection, as it is a historic site used during World War II.\n\nThe location of the 24-Zig road in Qinglong can be seen on Baidu maps here and on a Google map satellite image here. The contours of the 24-Zig road seen on both mapping services match the contours of the road in the misleading Facebook post's photo.\n\nAnother image of the 24-Zig road can also be seen here on the dangerousroads.org website.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the dangerousroads.org photo:\n\nDangerousroads.org also identifies the road as the 24-Zig Road, which it says is near Qinglong town in Guizhou Province, in southwest China.\n\n\u201cIt was built during WW-II, and played an important role in the supply of China during the war to help resist the Japanese invasion. At present the road is no longer in active use but is still used as a shortcut by motorbikes and three-wheelers,\u201d the website says.\n\nBelow is the dangerousroads.org photo -- which AFP has cropped to make comparison easier -- next to the the image used in the misleading Facebook post:\n\nKeyword searches using the term \u201c24-Zig\u201d led to a photograph of the road published in the Indian Quarterly with the caption: \u201cthe \u201824-Zig\u2019 road in Qinglong, December 9, 2011.\u201d\n\nThe image was taken by AFP photo editor Findlay Kember who wrote an account of travelling the length of the Ledo-Burma Road, also known as the Stilwell Road, which runs from Ledo in India's north-eastern state of Assam, through Myanmar and ends in Kunming in the south-western Chinese province of Yunnan.\n\nHere is a BBC story about Kember\u2019s trip, which also features a photograph of the \u201c24-Zig\u201d road.\n\nThe misleading Facebook posts claim the road in the image is a stretch of the national highway that runs through the mountainous Quezon National Park on the Bicol peninsula in the Philippines.\n\nA Google satellite image of Quezon National Park found the contours of the road in that area bear no resemblance to the road seen in the misleading image.", "lang": "en"}
