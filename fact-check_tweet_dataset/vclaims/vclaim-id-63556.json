And on May 27, Jackson offered some advice for President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Two thirds of Americans disapprove of Donald Trump not wearing a face mask in public, and the vast majority supports elected officials being required to wear masks in government buildings,\" Jackson tweeted.\n\nIs he right about the polling on Trump?\n\nOverall, yes: Polls show that most poll respondents believe the president should wear a mask, though the level of support varies by political affiliation.\n\nWhen we reached out to Jackson, he cited an online survey of 1,012 people by Navigator Research, a pollster that works with Democratic and progressive clients.\n\nTheir poll question asked, \"Do you approve or disapprove of Donald Trump\u2019s decision NOT to wear a face mask while in public?\"\n\nOf the group, 27% said they approve, and 65% said they disapprove.\n\nThis poll was conducted using an opt-in system, with respondents volunteering to participate. However, the data was weighted for \"a variety of demographic variables\" to approximate the national registered voter population, the firm said.\n\nA look at other polls using a variety of survey methods found similar results when asking whether Trump should wear a mask in public.\n\nThe Navigator poll stands out because it asked people whether they approved of Trump\u2019s decision, while other polls asked about masks without mentioning his behavior. Still, the results were comparable.\n\u2022 Huffington Post and YouGov poll over May 14-16: 63% support\n\u2022 Politico and Morning Consult poll between May 8-10: 70% support\n\nThe Quinnipiac and Kaiser polls used phone calls, while the HuffPost/YouGov and Politico/Morning Consult polls were online.\n\nThe most obvious divergence of views comes from partisan identification.\n\nWhile these surveys consistently show overall support for Trump wearing a mask, Republicans are far less enthusiastic. Here\u2019s the amount of support for the idea from Republicans in each poll:\n\nThe HuffPost/YouGov gave respondents the option to answer \"I don\u2019t care either way,\" which was the most common answer among Republicans and Trump voters.\n\nSo, among these four polls, support for Trump wearing a mask ranges between 63% and 72% among all types of voters, but it drops to between 38% and 58% among Republicans. And the Navigation Research poll found that 54% of Republicans approve of Trump\u2019s decision not to wear a mask.\n\nJackson said \"two-thirds of Americans disapprove of Donald Trump not wearing a face mask in public and the vast majority supports elected officials being required to wear masks in government buildings.\"\n\nIn each of five polls, between 63% and 72% of all respondents said Trump should wear a mask.
