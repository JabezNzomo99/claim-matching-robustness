Indonesia has officially been named as one of the MotoGP hosts in 2021. The world-class Mandalika circuit in NTB; the circuit with the most beautiful view in the world. The government does not need theories, let alone fictive things.\u201d\n\nIt referenced Prabowo Subianto, the only challenger to incumbent Joko Widodo in Indonesia\u2019s presidential poll in April.\n\nHere is an AFP report on the MotoGP hosting announcement. Mandalika in West Nusa Tenggara (NTB) province is the area of the planned MotoGP track.\n\nAFP found through a Google Reverse Image search that the photograph does not show the Indonesian circuit. It is a picture of the MotoGP host Sepang circuit in Malaysia, which is available on this link from the race\u2019s website.\n\nBelow is the screenshot of the picture on MotoGP\u2019s website:", "lang": "en"}
