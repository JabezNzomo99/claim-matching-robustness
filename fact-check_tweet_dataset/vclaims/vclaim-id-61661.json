They did not have an appointment and Clinton was not in the office.\n\nA story on the conservative Web site NewsMax reported that the women were unhappy with \"the outright shabby treatment shown them by the former First Lady... She and her staff simply refused to meet with them.\"\n\nThat claim was picked up in an e-mail that circulated in 2001 and has gotten new life since Clinton became a presidential candidate. The e-mail says that \"None other than the Queen herself, Hillary Rotten Clinton ... refused repeated requests to meet with the Gold Star Mothers.\"\n\nShirley Jones, the legislative chairman for the group in 2001 and one of the women who stopped by Clinton's office, says the e-mail is wrong. She said she sent Clinton a letter requesting a meeting and has since met with her four times. Clinton even sponsored a bill on behalf of the Gold Star Mothers.\n\n\"As a mother she was very understanding,\" Jones says. \"I felt she was very supportive \u2014 and I'm a Republican.\"\n\nThe Gold Star Mothers Web site says the allegation in the e-mail is incorrect. \"This story passed through several people before being reported by NewsMax on May 26, 2001 and the details were lost ... The NewsMax article did not get the story correct and we deeply regret the misunderstanding about Senator Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nSo we give the e-mail a False.", "lang": "en"}
