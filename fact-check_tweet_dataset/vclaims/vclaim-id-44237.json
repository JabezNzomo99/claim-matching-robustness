According to the list, 21 out of 27 candidates hail from the Muslim community.\n\nOn January 11, Facebook page Vishwa Hindu Mahasangh posted the viral list and wrote in Hindi, \u201cIs this list from Delhi or Lahore *Aam Aadmi Party\u2019s first list of Delhi assembly released * (followed by the list) Kejriwal aka Kejruddin, wants to turn Delhi into Pakistan.

Most of the candidate names have been changed and presented on social media. On January 14, Ankit Lal, social media and IT strategist for AAP tweeted the final list of MLA candidates for the 70 seats of Delhi assembly.\n\nAAP Twitter account also posted the full list along with photographs of all candidates in a tweet thread.\n\nSeveral media outlet including Hindustan Times, The Wire, Times of India, News 18andANI covered the news on January 14. One of the highlights of these reports was that AAP had dropped 15 sitting MLAs and offered the ticket to several new faces. According to the Hindustan Times, 23 new candidates were on the list.\n\nAlt News compared the names listed in the viral text and official list shared by AAP (table below). In the viral text, only eight names are correct while the remaining are fictional Muslim names. The correct names include Arvind Kejriwal, Padpadganj Manish Sisodia, Praveen Kumar, Sanjeev Jha, Atishi Marlena, Somnath Bharti, Amanatullah Khan and Imran Hussain. All other names on the list are fictional.\n\nThe viral text message therefore grossly misinforms the readers that the majority of AAP MLA candidates are from the Muslim community.\n\nSeveral social media users have shared the fake list of AAP candidates on Twitter and Facebook.", "lang": "en"}
