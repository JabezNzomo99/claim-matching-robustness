Jai Hind Bharat' Click here to view the archived version of the post.\n\nThe images made their way to Twitter as well.\n\nA day after Imran Khan announced in Pakistan's parliament that Abhinandan would be released, his parents retired Air Marshal S Varthaman and Dr. Shobha Varthaman boarded an Indigo flight from Chennai to Delhi .\n\nPassengers on the same flight on learning their identity began to applaud and made way for them as the couple exited the flight. A video capturing the moment has since gone viral on social media.\n\nIn the video, a visibly overwhelmed Dr. Shobha Varthaman Abhinandan's mother can be seen acknowledge the applause.\n\nFrom the video it is clear that the woman in the viral photographs is not Dr. Shobha Varthaman.\n\nSeveral news outlets have since then reported on Dr. Shobha Varthaman who has worked with Doctors Without Borders in war-ravaged countries.\n\nBOOM analysed the photographs and found that the channel logo visible in the photo is that of Pakistan's GeoTV. The ticker in Urdu loosely translates to 'Muslims from other countries attended the event'\n\nWe also ran a reverse image search on the viral photo and found instances of the photo being uploaded by Pakistani nationals in 2018.\n\nThe tweet in Urdu translates to, \"When you have the blessings of such mothers, nobody can harm you.
