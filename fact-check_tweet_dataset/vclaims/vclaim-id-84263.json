The claim is false; the voices heard on the video\u2019s audio are speaking Madurese, a regional Indonesian language.\n\nThe video can be seen in this May 22, 2019, Facebook post, where it has been viewed more than 60,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Indonesian language caption translates to English as: \u201cIncidentally shot by TV ONE. Brimob officers speak Chinese. So, that Brimob has been infiltrated by Chinese soldiers is not a hoax.\u201d\n\nTV One is an Indonesian broadcaster. This is its website.\n\nBrimob refers to the Indonesian police\u2019s Mobile Brigade special unit. Here is a video of Brimob members posted on the official Facebook page of the Indonesian police\u2019s public relations unit.\n\nIndonesian text on the white banner seen at the bottom of the video in the misleading posts translates to English as: \u201cPOLICE STRIKE BACK AT RIOTERS\u201d.

Here is its official Facebook page.\n\nThe same video was shared on YouTube, for example here, and Twitter, for example here, with a similar claim that Brimob officers could be heard speaking Chinese.\n\nThe claim is false; the voices heard on the video\u2019s audio are speaking Madurese, a regional Indonesian language.\n\nThe video footage in the misleading posts was taken from a genuine TV One report, which the TV station uploaded on its official YouTube channel here on May 21, 2019.\n\nThe video in the misleading social media posts corresponds with the Tv One YouTube video from 1:27:30 and 1:27:59.\n\n\n\n Chinese-speaking AFP reporters listened to the video\u2019s audio and confirmed the language being spoken was not Chinese.\n\n\u201cThey are speaking Madurese,\u201d Sapariah Saturi, a Jakarta-based journalist who speaks Madurese, told AFP by email on May 23, 2019.\n\nAccording to Sapariah, the people in the video in the misleading social media posts can be heard saying in part: \u201cLike this \u2026 It is second to none \u2026 [clearing his throat, then laughing] \u2026 Because I did not \u2026 [inaudible] \u2026 I lost out \u2026\u201d\n\nMadurese is a language spoken largely by people in the Indonesian island of Madura and the eastern part of Java island.", "lang": "en"}
