In the four cases documented below, he claims that he first called for a specific action sooner than he actually did. Sometimes he cites a Jan. 27 opinion article he published in USA Today, titled \u201cTrump is worst possible leader to deal with coronavirus outbreak.\u201d The op-ed appeared only days after the Chinese government shut down the city of Wuhan in an effort to stem the crisis. But the article itself was more of an attack on President Trump and a recollection of Obama administration steps taken against the 2014 Ebola outbreak than a detailed plan for action against a possible pandemic.\n\nApril 1, El Show De Piolin: \u201cThe president was very, very slow out of the gate. I argued a month ago he should invoke what they call the Defense Production Act, but we didn\u2019t have enough ventilators to go out and say this, under the law, the president can become the commander in chief as in wartime, and dictate that companies produce things that are badly needed.\"\n\nMarch 31, Brian Williams\u2019s show on MSNBC: \u201cOn January the 17th [sic], I think, I wrote an article for one of the major press outlets saying that we had to begin to act now. We knew what was happening in China and we talked \u2014 guys like me \u2014 and I\u2019m not the only one \u2014 others talked about the need to employ the Defense Authorization legislation \u2014 act to be able to move, I think the president and his team have been very slow to move.\u201d\n\nTrump has been reluctant to use the DPA, calling it a \u201chammer\u201d he holds in reserve. So Biden would have every right to call him out on that score. But Biden can\u2019t suggest he called for it as far back as January. His opinion article in USA Today did not mention the DPA.\n\nMarch 30, MSNBC\u2019s \u201cLive With Katy Tur\u201d: \u201cI suggested we should have people in China at the outset of this event, when it all started, in Luhan province [sic]. And what happened? We did not insist that they go into the areas we wanted to. I just \u2014 that\u2019s all I can do is do what I know has to be done. Say what I know has to be done.\u201d\n\nMarch 27, remarks at a virtual CNN town hall: \u201cHe, in addition to that, when we were talking about early on in this crisis, we said \u2014 I said, among others, that, you know, you should get into China, get our experts there, we have the best in the world, get them in so we know what\u2019s actually happening. There was no effort to do that. He didn\u2019t put any pressure on Xi [Jinping]. I guess because of his trade deal, which wasn\u2019t much of a deal. And in addition to that, what happened was, we had one person in the country who was working \u2014 he pulled him out of the country.\u201d\n\nThe reality: As we noted before, Biden first said this during a Democratic primary debate Feb. 25, not in January: \u201cAnd here\u2019s the deal,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI would be on the phone with China and making it clear, we are going to need to be in your country; you have to be open; you have to be clear; we have to know what\u2019s going on; we have to be there with you, and insist on it and insist, insist, insist.\u201d\n\nThe reality: Biden again suggests that he said this in January. But he first said China could not be trusted Feb. 26, during a CNN town hall: \u201cThe last point I\u2019d make, and I know I\u2019m going to get a lot of questions, is that what we did \u2014 what I would do were I president now, I would not be taking China\u2019s word for it. I would insist that China allow our scientists in to make a hard determination of how it started, where it\u2019s from, how far along it is. Because that is not happening now.\u201d\n\nWith Trump under fire for a slow and indecisive response to the coronavirus, Biden is clearly trying to demonstrate that he would have taken action sooner. That may well be case; certainly his op-ed indicated that he was concerned about this issue before many Americans had paid much attention. Unlike Trump, there is no record of Biden dismissing the urgency of the problem or suggesting that it will go away by itself.\n\nBut the vice president gets into trouble when he suggests that he first raised issues such as invoking the DPA or building hospitals as early as January \u2014 when in fact we can only trace such statements to late February or mid-March. By that point, the potential impact of the virus was becoming apparent to most Americans.", "lang": "en"}
