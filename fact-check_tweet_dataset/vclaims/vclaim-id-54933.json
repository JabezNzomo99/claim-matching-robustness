It claims that the first volunteer for a COVID-19 vaccine trial in the United Kingdom, Oxford microbiologist Elisa Granato, died \u201ctwo days after the vaccine was administered\u201d, and further claimed that \u201cfour other volunteer[s] are said to be battling complications due to adverse reactions of the vaccine\u201d, without providing any supporting evidence. The spread of this article has been promoted by groups opposing vaccination as well as groups promoting conspiracy theories.\n\nThese claims are false. In fact, Granato had tweeted several hours after her supposed demise, as reported by this Guardian article, which established that Granato is alive and well. The U.K. Department of Health and Social Care also publicly refuted the claim on Twitter, stating that \u201cNews circulating on social media that the first volunteer in a UK #coronavirus vaccine trial has died is completely untrue.\u201d BBC medical correspondent Fergus Walsh also confirmed that Granato is \u201cvery much alive\u201d in a tweet and a video posted on 26 April 2020.\n\nHead of the Oxford Vaccine Group, Andrew Pollard, who is leading the trial, has said that \u201cthis sort of fake news could damage our ability to tackle a pandemic. We can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d\n\nThe first COVID-19 vaccine trial in the U.K. is testing a candidate developed by scientists at Oxford University, which is based on a recombinant viral vector that contains genetic material encoding the spike protein of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The spike protein is important for enabling the virus to enter cells and establish an infection. The viral vector, which is a chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine vector (ChAdOx1), was developed at Oxford\u2019s Jenner Institute and chosen for its ability to induce a strong immune response and because it cannot replicate and therefore cannot cause infection, making it safer for people.\n\nWhen injected, the vaccine induces the body to produce the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which in turn triggers the body to mount an immune response against these proteins, including antibody production. When the body encounters the actual virus later, it can quickly mount a defense against the virus due to previous exposure to the spike protein, thereby protecting against future infection.\n\nA report of the first two volunteers receiving the vaccine candidate, including Granato, was published by the BBC on 23 April 2020.\n\nYou can learn more about the vaccine trial at this Oxford University website.\n\nFull Fact and Reuters also fact-checked this claim and labeled it \u201cfalse\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
