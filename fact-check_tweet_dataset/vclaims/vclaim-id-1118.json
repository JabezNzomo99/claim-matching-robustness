This claim is false. This is an old video of a staged prank.\n\nExamples of the post from Facebook, Twitter and Instagram can be found here , here , here , here and here .\n\nThe video shows a black man taunting another man wearing an outfit similar to that of the Queen\u2019s Guard. The black man dances in front of him and shouts in his face, while saying \u201che can\u2019t do nothing\u201d. The man dressed up as a Queen\u2019s Guard then appears to punch the black man to the ground where he lies immobile.\n\nComments accompanying the video posts imply that the video is serious and the event did happen. One reads: \u201cThe queen\u2019s guard doing his duty. That ignorant black man deserved the slap.\u201d\n\nAnother social media user writes: \u201cI hope he got a commendation for that. Bring the Guards out in Whitehall to protect the Cenotaph (war memorial) etc.\u201d\n\nThis video is being posted amid racial tensions triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black American who died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.\n\nOne post claims that the black man in the video is from Black Lives Matter, who are leading anti-racism protests ( here ).\n\nThis video is a staged prank. The original video was published by the satirical site Trollstation in June 2015 ( here ).\n\nTrollstation describes itself as \u201ca Youtube channel specialising in bizarre and often surreal pranks performed on unwitting members of the public. Our content is intentionally provocative & controversial with the aim to get reactions from the general public in the name of comedic Satire and entertainment ( here ).\n\nThe full video makes it evident that the \u2018guard\u2019 is not a real member of the Queen\u2019s Guard attacking someone: his uniform is not an exact match; the guard can be seen attacking people in various locations; and at the end of the video one of the men can be heard saying \u201cwe\u2019re making a movie, he\u2019s an actor\u201d.\n\nFalse. A member of the Queen\u2019s Guard did not punch a black man to the ground. This video was a prank published by a satirical site in 2015.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
