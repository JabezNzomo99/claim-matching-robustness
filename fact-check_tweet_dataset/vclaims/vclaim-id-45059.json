But three of the four images cited are old and have nothing to do with the protests.\n\nThe protests against police brutality following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis, have at times been followed by vandalism and looting.\n\nBut a Facebook post is accusing protesters of \u201cdestroying\u201d tributes to veterans by spreading photos of vandalized memorials that in reality are years old and have nothing to do with the protests. Only one of the four pictures is current and related.\n\n\u201cLet me start by saying \u2013 I don\u2019t agree with any one who is innocent being killed like George Floyd was,\u201d the post reads. \u201cThis is absolutely ridiculous. If you dislike the United States this much then PLEASE feel free to find a new place to live where you will have absolutely no rights like we do here. Destroying the cemeteries that hold bodies of men and women who have fought for our freedom is beyond disrespect.\u201d\n\nWe found that three of the four images that are paired with the post are old and unrelated to the recent protests against police brutality:\n\u2022 One image is a police department photo from Henderson, Kentucky, from 2016 that shows a wrecked Memorial Day display of crosses at a park. A man was arrested for driving his car through the display, according to Time.\n\u2022 Another image, also from 2016, shows graffiti on a memorial for Vietnam War veterans in Los Angeles. The same photo can be seen in an Associated Press report about the sentencing of the 24-year-old man responsible.\n\u2022 A third image depicts a smashed stone memorial for Lt. Michael P. Murphy in Suffolk County, New York. Murphy was a Navy Seal killed in Afghanistan who received the Medal of Honor posthumously. A 14-year-old boy was arrested in July 2018 for vandalizing the memorial, according to the Suffolk County Police Department.\n\nOnly one of the four images used is related to the current protests. It shows vandalism at the base of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.\n\nNational Mall and Memorial Parks, a part of the National Park Service, shared a photo of that defacement \u2014 the spray paint reads, \u201cYall not tired yet?\u201d \u2014 in a May 31 tweet about vandalism that occurred amid demonstrations the night before.\n\nThe tweet also included two other photos, showing that the World War II Memorial and the statue of General Casimir Pulaski were also defaced.\n\nThe Facebook post could have made its point by showing the National Mall and Memorial Park\u2019s photos of vandalized memorials. But none of those photos \u2014 or the ones in the Facebook post \u2014 show protesters \u201cdestroying the cemeteries that hold bodies of men and women who have fought for our freedom,\u201d as the post said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
