Share video more and more and like our Facebook page.\"\n\nThe video is viral on multiple Facebook pages and Twitter handles.\n\nIt has also been shared on Twitter with the same narrative.\n\nBOOM could ascertain that the video is not from Kashmir as tree fellers majorly conversed in a local Himachali dialect.\n\nFurthermore, two people can be seen wearing the traditional Himachali cap.\n\nWe then broke the video into key frames and ran a reverse image search on a few of its frames. We were directed to the same video that was uploaded to YouTube by Himachal Watcher, in July last year.\n\nThe video has been described as, \"Ongoing slaughter of fruit-laden trees in Himachal Pradesh\".\n\nThe description of the video states the following:\n\n\" A video of the ongoing slaughter of fruit-laden apple trees under the High Court mandated drive to free forest land from encroachers. Thousands of trees have already been felled and a large number of them are to felled under this drive. While it is an appreciable move to free encroached land, the disappearance of thousands of trees in a short period doesn't sound to be an appropriate move considering the impact on ecology. \"\n\nThe Himachal Pradesh High Court granted a week's time to the Special Investigation Team (SIT) to complete felling of the apple plants in the apple belt of Shimla in May last year as part of the drive to clear illegal encroachments on forest land, reported the Indian Express.", "lang": "en"}
