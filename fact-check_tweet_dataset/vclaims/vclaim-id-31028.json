The claim is false; the video has circulated online since 2016 in media reports about a funeral march for a fallen Kashmiri rebel.\n\nThe video was published in this Facebook post by a Tamil-language Facebook page on August 8, 2019.\n\nIt has been viewed more than 26,000 times and shared more than 1,900 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe Tamil-language caption translates to English as: \u201cDue to Indian occupation of Kashmir, hundreds of thousands of Kashmiri people took to the streets yesterday to release their land from India... Since Indian media concealed such a big rally, one of the Kashmiris has requested this video to be shared with the world. So please share as much as possible.\u201d\n\nThe post was published three days after India stripped Kashmir of the special autonomy it had for seven decades on August 5, 2019. Here is an AFP report on the situation.\n\nThe same video was shared with a similar claim on Facebook here and here, where it has been viewed 10,000 times; and on YouTube here.\n\nThe claim is false; the video has previously circulated in media reports about a funeral march for a fallen Kashmiri rebel in 2016.\n\nThe one-minute, 47-second video features a mass of people in an open area, chanting in Urdu. Their chants can be translated to English as: \u201cWe will eventually take freedom, freedom is our right.\u201d\n\nSome of the protesters can also be seen holding Pakistani flags.\n\nA reverse image search on Google of the video for a keyframe obtained using InVid found this slightly longer footage, posted on November 22, 2016, on Twitter.\n\nThe tweet says: \u201cThis video is dedicated to the lovers of #BurhanWani must watch this a huge gathering in the funeral of Burhan. #FreeKashmir\u201d.\n\nFrom the 0:13 mark to the end, the two-minute, four-second Twitter video corresponds with the footage in the misleading post.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the misleading video (L) and the video from the 2016 Twitter video (R):\n\nBurhan Wani, commander of Kashmiri rebel group Hizbul Mujahideen, was killed on July 8, 2016, in a shootout with government forces in Jammu and Kashmir. Here is an AFP report about his death.\n\nA keyword search found this YouTube video published on October 2016, titled: \u201cA Sea Of People In The Funeral of Burhan Wani In Tral Kashmir\u201d.\n\nThe same man can be seen filming the same funeral procession which is shown in the misleading video.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the man filming the video in the misleading posts (L) and the 2016 YouTube video (R):\n\nA Google keyword search for Burhan Wani\u2019s funeral on Google found multiple Getty Images photos published in July 2016 which corresponded with the video in the misleading post including here and here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the first photo published by Getty Images on July 9, 2016:", "lang": "en"}
