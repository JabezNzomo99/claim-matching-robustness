Housing problems or worries (e.g. affording the rent, poor conditions, losing my tenancy etc.) have made me feel physically ill/sick in the last year.\u201d\n\n10% of the private renters surveyed strongly agreed and another 13% answered \u201ctend to agree\u201d, meaning around a quarter agreed to some extent.\n\nThe Guardian headlined its piece \u201cPrivate renting making millions sick in England, poll shows.\u201d\n\nThis suggests a causal link specifically between renting privately (as opposed to renting from the council or some other housing situation) and feeling physically ill or sick. This isn\u2019t evidenced in the survey. Sickness could have been caused by housing concerns not specific to renting privately, as the researchers didn\u2019t ask, for example, people who owned their houses, or rent from the council, if they had experienced similar feelings.\n\nAlso, because the study didn\u2019t survey homeowners or social renters, we can\u2019t tell whether housing-related illness is more or less of an issue among private renters.", "lang": "en"}
