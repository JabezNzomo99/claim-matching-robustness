Cuneta is married to Senator Francis \"Kiko\" Pangilinan, president of the Liberal Party.\n\nCuneta did say in an Instagram Live video that she wanted Robredo to run for president in 2022, but she did not say that Duterte is weak or that the Liberal Party will return to power.\n\nIn her video, which was live on June 29, Cuneta said, \u201cI hope VP Leni [Robredo] runs for president next time dahil hindi na rin makakatakbo si Tatay next time. One term lang \u2018di ba.\" President Duterte is referred to as \"Tatay\" by many.\n\nCuneta drew the ire of Duterte supporters online after defending her daughter Frankie Pangilinan, who was threatened with rape by a man who openly supports the President. In her Instagram Live video, Cuneta explained that she has always kept friendships and politics separate, saying she had warm ties with Duterte and the other 2016 presidential candidates but she chose not to endorse any of them at the time.\n\nA Google reverse image search returns the exact same photo of Cuneta used in a Politiko article dated May 3, 2016. Politiko's image also cites Pangilinan's Facebook page as the source in the same font color and capitalization as the quote card. \u2013 Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
