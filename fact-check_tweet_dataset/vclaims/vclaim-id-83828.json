The post is false; it has manipulated the screengrab from an original that accurately reported the results of a survey.\n\nThe posts, including this December 9 entry, have been shared thousands of times.\n\nThe bar chart purportedly shows a survey done by Jakarta-based pollster LSI, claiming Widodo, better known as Jokowi, and his running mate, Ma\u2019ruf Amin, had 98.22 percent support.\n\nThe image claims the pair\u2019s sole challengers in 2019 elections, Prabowo Subianto and running mate Sandiaga Uno, had 1.81 percent support.\n\nIt said 0.1 percent of respondents were either undecided or did not give a choice.\n\nThe text in the post above translates as:\n\n\u201cIf you want to lie, please use your brain!!! 98.22 + 1.81 + 0.1 = 100.13%? So how can you get the 0.13 percent??? There\u2019s another one: the bar for Prabowo says his figure is 1.81%, but how can it be smaller that the bar for 0.1% of undecided voters? Where\u2019s your brain? A giant TV station like you only does what the leader wants and is unable to independently decide what news to report.\u201d\n\nThe image was also shared to this Facebook group that supports Subianto, whose camp has publicly said it had boycotted Metro TV for \u201cbiased and disadvantageous reporting\u201d on the candidate.\n\nHere is an article on the claims by Subianto\u2019s camp of boycotting Metro TV.\n\nMetro TV is owned by Surya Paloh, a media-mogul-cum-politician who is backing Widodo in the coming election.\n\nSome of the comments on the false posts branded Metro TV deceitful. A translation of the comment in the screenshot below from one of the posts is: \u201cStupid TV station. Don\u2019t watch it .. Deceitful.. deceitful.\u201d\n\nGoogle Reverse Image results showed the misleading photo was a manipulated version of a genuine report by Metro TV. The broadcaster uploaded a video of it on August 21, 2018.\n\nThe chart can be seen at 0:47 of the video, which is headlined: \u201cLatest survey: Jokowi-Ma\u2019ruf leads by a big margin\u201d.\n\nThe genuine results showed Widodo had 52.2 percent support, with Subianto at 29.5 percent and 18.3 percent undecided or not giving a response.\n\nBelow are the comparison between the doctored image and a snapshot from the news report clip.\n\nHere are links to reports from Indonesian news outlets Detik and Kompas on the actual LSI survey.", "lang": "en"}
