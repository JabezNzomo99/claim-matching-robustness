It\u2019s actually a photoshopped screen grab of a real 2016 tweet about flag burning.\n\nThe screen grab of Trump\u2019s alleged tweet suggesting punishment for people who photoshop \u201cunflattering\u201d images of him resurfaced in February. It comes after a doctored photo appearing to show the president having a dark tan line on his face went viral earlier this month.\n\nThere is, however, no evidence Trump ever tweeting that statement. A search of Trump\u2019s official Twitter accounts turned up no similar or matching tweets. ProPublica\u2019s archive of the president\u2019s deleted tweets doesn\u2019t have a record of it on Nov. 29, 2016, or any other date.\n\nThrough a review of Trump\u2019s @realDonaldTrump timeline, the Daily Caller discovered that it is actually a digitally altered version of a real tweet. On Nov. 29, 2016, Trump took to Twitter to comment on flag burning.
