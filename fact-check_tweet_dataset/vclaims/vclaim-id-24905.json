Mr Khan is travelling for work, so there could be no possibility of the claimed meeting,\u201d she said.\n\nTabrez Ansari, a daily wage labourer was tied to a pole and assaulted by a mob in Jharkhand on June 18, 2019. He was forced to chant \u201cJai Shri Ram and \u201cJai Hanuman\u201d. Ansari was arrested on charges of theft and sent to judicial custody, but died of his injuries in the hospital.\n\nThe viral video claims that after Bollywood superstars Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan took the initiative to reach out to Tabrez Ansari\u2019s widow, Shaista Parveen. A cropped image of Aamir Khan has been placed beside a devastated Parveen to show how Khan interacted with them, in the 11 minute long video clip.\n\nThe video had more than 4 lakh views at the time of writing this article.\n\nThe archived video can be viewed here.\n\nBOOM was able to ascertain that Aamir Khan\u2019s image used in the video is old and unrelated. We found that the image, where he can be seen wearing a pink T-shirt, has been on the internet since 2012 and doesn\u2019t have similarities with how Khan looks currently with a beard.\n\nFurthermore, a clip from the video, where Khan can be heard saying, \u201cI am injured emotionally, because I feel angry, helpless and want to leave everything and help him. It was very difficult for me to see this...,\u201d and getting emotional while speaking, has been cleverly included to portray how he has been affected.\n\nBOOM found that the video is originally from the launch of Satyamev Jayate\u2019s Season 3.\n\nThe video further attributes an unrelated comment, \u201cLet people be from any religion or caste. If such an incident happens with any individual, then it is a really sad thing for our country,\u201d falsely to Aamir Khan.\n\nThe same post has a compilation of old and unrelated clippings of Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan interacting with the press, to falsely claim that they spoke about Tabrez Ansari.\n\nMeanwhile, another set of viral posts were doing the rounds last month to claim that Salman Khan has lent his support to Tabrez\u2019s family and will bear the legal expenses.\n\nBOOM reached out to Tabrez\u2019s distant relative from Bokaro Afzal Anees, who denied such claims. \u201cThere has been no such communication from Mr Salman Khan\u2019s office. We are looking into the legal proceedings of Tabrez and we have not been communicated about any such developments. Also, rumours about Shah Rukh Khan meeting Tabrez's family are false.\u201d\n\nWe also spoke to the SP, Karthik S, who rubbished the claims.\n\nBOOM made repeated attempts to reach out to Salman Khan, through his manager. The article will be updated when Khan responds.", "lang": "en"}
