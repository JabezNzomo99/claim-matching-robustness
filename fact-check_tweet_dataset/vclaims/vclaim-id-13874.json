He says that at present there can be no better prime minister than Modi. Friends, let the Jihadis and Congress know that they could never bring back any army personnel alive, but Abhinandan not only came back, he voted for BJP too. Abhinandan, you are most welcome.\"\n\nThe post has taken the social media by storm and is being shared from several fan pages of the prime minister.\n\nThe viral post can be viewed here and its archived version can be accessed here.\n\nBOOM tried to track the person seen in the viral image through a reverse image search without any success.\n\nHowever, upon examining the picture closely, we spotted glaring differences in facial features of the IAF pilot and his doppelganger.\n\nAbhinandan Varthaman has a mole below the left side of his lower lip which cannot be seen in the other image.\n\nThere is a visible difference between the nose of the air force pilot and that of the man's seen in the viral photo. Abhinandan's nose is sharper than the man in the image.\n\nThe man in the viral post has a mole below his right eye. However, Abhinandan has no such mole under his right eye.\n\nThe IAF pilot lives in Chennai and is likely to be a registered voter in Tamil Nadu. The first phase of the Lok Sabha polls held on April 11 did not cover Tamil Nadu. As many as 39 Parliamentary constituencies of Tamil Nadu will go to poll in the second phase of polling on April 18.\n\nAlso, the viral image shows a shop behind the IAF pilot's doppelganger that has the words 'samosa centre' written on it. Signboards in Tamil Nadu are usually in Tamil or English.", "lang": "en"}
