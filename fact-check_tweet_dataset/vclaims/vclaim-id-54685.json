I signed the medical appliance tax bill that forced companies to outsource manufacturing of masks, gowns, gloves and ventilaors [sic] to China, Europe and Russia to avoid the tax.\"\n\nThe image piqued our interest because it combined a few hot-button issues. First, the concern that the U.S. is experiencing a shortage of ventilators and personal protective equipment, or PPE, like masks, gowns and gloves to help protect front-line workers from coronavirus. Second, issues related to trade imbalances and the outsourcing of American manufacturing abroad are likely to be frequent themes on the presidential campaign trail. So we decided to dig in.\n\nThough the image did not include sourcing or sponsorship information, its target \u2014 the \"medical appliance tax bill\" \u2014 seemed to be a reference to the medical device tax (more formally known as the medical device excise tax) that became law as part of the Affordable Care Act. Additionally, much of the social media post tracked closely to statements made by conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh during an April 2 episode of his talk show, which included a discussion of the medical device tax.\n\nBefore we get into the specifics of the medical device tax, two critical elements of the post must be addressed. First, did Obama ever say anything like what the viral image claims? We checked with Eric Schultz, a senior adviser to the former president. In an email he wrote back: \"President Obama obviously didn\u2019t say this!\"\n\nA key piece of evidence that supports Schultz\u2019s statement is the use of the term \"medical appliance device tax bill.\"\n\nBottom line: We couldn\u2019t find any other reference \u2014 either official or unofficial \u2014 to a piece of federal legislation bearing this name or nickname. And, though the experts we spoke with agreed the social media post was likely directed at the device tax included in the ACA, none had ever heard it referred to with that moniker \u2014 a point that adds more skepticism to the image\u2019s claim.\n\nAnd what is the medical device tax?\n\nIn order to pay for the ACA\u2019s expansion of health coverage, taxes were increased for various industries \u2014 including the medical device industry \u2014 that would benefit from more people getting health insurance. The tax was controversial and triggered considerable pushback.\n\nThe measure set a 2.3% excise tax on medical devices, sold in the United States beginning in January 2013. The tax applied to both domestic manufacturers and importers of medical devices.\n\nBut, it did not apply to items made in the U.S. for foreign export, said John McDonough, a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who also served as a senior adviser during the Obama administration and helped write the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"The tax was designed deliberately\" to avoid forcing manufacturers to move their production overseas, McDonough wrote in an email.\n\nOpponents of the tax argued that it was a severe financial burden on medical device manufacturers. They also estimated that it would have resulted in the loss of more than 20,000 full-time domestic jobs in the industry.\n\nJoseph Antos, a health policy scholar with the American Enterprise Institute, said that the tax was punishing on the medical device industry because it was implemented on \"gross sales rather than profits,\" which raised issues for small device firms.\n\nHowever, a 2015 Congressional Research Service report said that the medical device tax seemed to have only \"fairly minor effects\" on jobs with \"output and employment in the industry falling by no more than two-tenths of 1%.\"\n\nAntos said that though the tax \"clearly\" had an effect on the industry, he wasn't aware of any studies or statistics that showed production and sales moving overseas because of it.\n\nBut Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow and expert in health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, took an even harder line on the social media image\u2019s assertion. \"It\u2019s absolutely false on the face of it,\" he said. \"There was no way the tax provided any incentive to shift production overseas.\"\n\nVan de Water also said that while there was some shift of manufacturing overseas while the tax was in effect, there were other factors leading that push, such as competition and pressure to reduce costs.\n\n\"There\u2019s no way to attribute that to the device tax itself,\" he added.\n\nAnd, there\u2019s another complication. Congress acted to put the medical device tax on hold at the end of 2015 -- in part due to significant lobbying by the medical device industry, as well as opposition to it from both Republican and Democratic members of Congress who had medical device companies headquartered in their states. In December 2019, President Donald Trump permanently repealed the tax when he signed a bipartisan federal spending package.\n\n\"The tax was only in effect for three years, from 2013 to 2015,\" said Van de Water. \"Even if it [the medical device tax] had some effect, that effect would have ended in 2016. We\u2019re now four years later.\"\n\nSo finally, does the now non-existent medical device tax have anything to do with our current PPE shortage in the face of the coronavirus pandemic?\n\nThe answer to that is also no, said the experts.\n\nThe current personal protective equipment shortage can be attributed to the lack of a stockpile reserve of PPE, an initial slow response by the U.S. and the tariffs imposed against Chinese goods by the Trump administration, said Peter Petri, a professor of international finance at Brandeis University outside Boston.\n\nAEI\u2019s Antos considered it an issue of the huge demand for these items, which has made replenishing stockpiles more difficult.\n\nAccording to a recent report from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in 2018 China was the source of 48% of U.S. imports of PPE. Seventy percent of the United States\u2019 mouth and nose protective gear, such as masks, came from China in 2018. Overall, China is a major supplier of PPE to countries all over the world.\n\nPetri said this makes sense, since China is a low-cost manufacturer of these relatively simple products. But it also became a problem once the White House started implementing tariffs on Chinese products.\n\n\"For nearly a year, U.S. buyers have been moving their PPE business away from China to other countries because of the Trump tariff wall,\" Petri wrote in an email.\n\nBut those manufacturers in other countries were not able to scale up their production to make up for the amount of supplies needed when the coronavirus hit.\n\n\"Meanwhile Chinese suppliers were turning to markets in Europe. The U.S. could not have chosen a worse time to turn its back on the world's largest PPE producer,\" said Petri.\n\nChina\u2019s massive manufacturing capacity did allow it to scale up production to account for the coronavirus pandemic, but because it had already established businesses in other locales and in response to the imposed tariffs, Petri suggested, it is unlikely now that China would be as receptive to U.S. requests for PPE.\n\nNothing in this viral image is accurate. There is even a spelling error.\n\nObama did not sign anything into law called the \"medical appliance tax bill.\" A moratorium was placed on the medical device tax he did sign into law as part of the Affordable Care Act in late 2015. Therefore, that tax was put on hold in 2016 and eventually repealed by Trump in 2019.\n\nInstead, experts we consulted agreed that the current PPE shortage is more aptly linked to the inadequate national emergency stockpile of PPE, increased demand for the products and the Trump administration\u2019s Chinese trade policies.\n\nOur ruling is Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
