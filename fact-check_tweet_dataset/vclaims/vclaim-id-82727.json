But Trump is unusual in that he always insists he is right, no matter how little evidence he has for his claim. Frankly, it\u2019s really not interesting to fact check The Donald, as his assertions are so easily debunked. Still, he scores a hat trick on this list.\n\nIn compiling this list, which has no particular order, we primarily focused on claims that had earned Four Pinocchios during the year. We also tried to focus on issues of broad interest. To keep it simple, we have shortened the quotes in the headlines.

But there is little evidence in the public record that was the case, even though Clinton claimed \u201cthere was enough political momentum\u201d at the time to amend the constitution. (Clinton later said it only had come up in \u201cprivate discussions.\u201d)\n\n\u201cThe Mexican Government is forcing criminals, drug dealers and rapists into the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince Sandy Hook there has been a school shooting, on average, every week.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith Al Gore, I helped organize the first hearings in the Senate on climate change in 1988.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State John F. Kerry for years has said he organized the first Senate hearings on climate change with then-Sens. Al Gore and Tim Wirth. But that was false. Kerry was not at the pivotal 1988 hearing in the Senate \u2014 and neither was Gore, who organized the first hearing in the House in 1981. On top of that, Kerry described witnessing events that did not happen.\n\n\u201cThe science on climate change is not settled because in 1970s we were worried about \u2018global freezing.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cObama never says the United States is exceptional or great.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Keystone pipeline is for oil that bypasses the United States.\u201d\n\nLong before President Obama killed the Keystone pipeline project, he made a number of dubious claims about it, including that the pipeline would have no benefit for American producers at all. But the crude oil would have traveled to the Gulf Coast, where it would be refined into products such as motor gasoline and diesel fuel; the State Department said odds were low that all would be exported. Also, about 12 percent of the pipeline\u2019s capacity had been set aside for crude from North Dakota and Montana.\n\n\u201cA man was put in prison for conspiracy just for having dirt on his land.\u201d\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) loved to tell the story of an elderly man sitting in prison for 10 years after being accused of racketeering and organized crime \u2014 just for putting dirt on his land. But just about every aspect of Paul\u2019s recounting was inaccurate and misleading. The man, Robert Lucas, was convicted of mail fraud, conspiracy and environmental violations for his role in developing 67 mobile home lots inside federally protected wetlands, building on wetlands without approval and knowingly selling land with illegal sewage systems that were likely to fail.", "lang": "en"}
