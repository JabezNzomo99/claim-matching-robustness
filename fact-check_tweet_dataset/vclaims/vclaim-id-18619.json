France\u2019 healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP was just under 9%, and Germany\u2019s was just over. If you add in private healthcare, just under 10% of UK GDP was spending on health, compared to about 11% of France and Germany\u2019s GDP.\n\nAnd Norman Lamb is also correct that UK spending on health as a proportion of GDP is set to decrease in the future.\n\nPublic spending on the NHS across the UK is projected to go from 7.3% of GDP in 2015/16 to to 6.7% of GDP by the end of this parliament.\n\nThat\u2019s not because public spending on healthcare is falling, but because it\u2019s predicted that other parts of GDP will grow faster.", "lang": "en"}
