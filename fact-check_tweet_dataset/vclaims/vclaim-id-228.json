Please register your reason for travel by calling 1300 1MY GOV (+61 1300 169 468) within 15 minutes of receiving this SMS.\u201d\n\nCOVIDSafe is a phone app that uses Bluetooth technology to log when people have been physically close to an infected person. Its use is voluntary, but it has been promoted by the Australian government as a way to help trace and notify people who may have been exposed to the coronavirus (here).\n\nA spokesperson for the Australian Department of Health told Reuters that the message is a hoax. \u201cIt is abhorrent that scammers would attempt to use the COVIDSafe app, a public health tool, to try and catch out Australians,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cThe COVIDSafe App does not have any geolocation capability. It does not track your location, only the proximity of your phone to other people\u2019s phones that have downloaded the app. It cannot monitor a person\u2019s location at any time.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson said that the app does not register a person\u2019s home address and any information is only shared when authorised by the user to the officials involved in contact-tracing.\n\nOn Twitter, the health department said that anyone who received the hoax text should delete it, and warned people to not call or text the phone number provided. (here)\n\nHealth minister Greg Hunt said that the hoax has been referred to the Federal Police for investigation, and those found responsible \u201cwill be charged with a significant criminal offence\u201d. (here)\n\nFalse. Australians who have downloaded the COVIDSafe app will not receive a text message if they are suspected of travelling more than 20 km from home.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
