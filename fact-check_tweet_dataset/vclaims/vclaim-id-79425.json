Reportedly, the Indian Army on August 31 said that Chinese troops \"carried out provocative military movements to change the status quo\" near Pangong Tso lake on the night of August 29/30 but they were blocked and thwarted by Indian Army soldiers. The incident took place on the south bank of the Pangong Tso. The fresh flare-up comes amid ongoing talks to disengage and de-escalate tensions between India and China to resolve the four-month-long standoff in eastern Ladakh. \"On the Night of 29/30 August 2020, PLA troops violated the previous consensus arrived at during military and diplomatic engagements during the ongoing standoff in Eastern Ladakh and carried out provocative military movements to change the status quo,\" the Indian Army said in its statement.
