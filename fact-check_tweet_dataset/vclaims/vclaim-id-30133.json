Let\u2019s analyze the authenticity of the claim.\n\n\n\nWhen searched on Facebook with the text \u2018Muslims in detention camp in Assam\u2019, similar posts with the same video were found. But, the video in them had the watermark \u2018Truthlanka.com\u2019. So, when searched on Google with the text \u2018brutal assault in a sri lanka detention centre\u2019, the same video (shorter version) was found in the search result of \u2018Asia Times\u2019. From that article, it was found that \u2018Angunakolapelessa\u2019 (Sri Lanka) prison officials had treated the inmates badly by beating them with batons and forcing them to crawl forcibly. Further, a probe was ordered into the incident, after the CCTV footage was leaked. So, the video has nothing to do with India and the claim is false.\n\nTo conclude, the CCTV footage of prison in Sri Lanka is being shared as \u2018Muslims in Assam detention centres\u2019.\n\nDid you watch our video on the 10 Most Ridiculous Fake News of the Year 2019?", "lang": "en"}
