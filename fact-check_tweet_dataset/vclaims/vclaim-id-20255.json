The poem titled \"My Brother With a Bloodied Nose\" was shared saying, \"A Poem written by Adhiti- Abhinandan\u2019s sister\".The poem was actually written by Varun Ram Iyer, a full-time Management Consultant in a leading MNC. People seem to have taken the word \"Brother\" used in the poem by Iyer quite literally.Times Fact Check selected the first four lines of the poem and searched on Facebook using it. We opened the post of each user and Facebook page that had shared the poem until we found a post by a Facebook page by the name of \"Dr Richa Arora\" that had shared the post 15 hours ago.While many users and pages credited the poem to \"Adhiti\", Abhinandan's sister, we saw that the poem was credited to \"@varunramiyer\" on the post made by this particular page. The page also had a link to the Facebook post Iyer made on February 27, the day Abhinandan was captured by the Pakistani Army, sharing his poem.Iyer ended his Facebook post saying, \"Salut!\" and writing his name -- Varun Ramachandran -- and the date - 27.02.2019.We checked his Facebook profile and saw that he has made a post requesting people to let those sharing his poem as someone else's know that it is indeed his work. Here's his post:Times Fact Check got in touch with Iyer. Talking about what made him write the poem, Iyer said, \"The poise and the grace of Wing Commander Abhinandan in the face of extreme adversity struck a chord. It made me wonder if we had a collective responsibility to view an issue as grave as war through a more logical lens. The poem is an ode to him and a gentle reminder to us all (including myself) that the dignity of our opinions is non negotiable and we could all work towards a more tolerant expression of our views, however polarizing they may be.\"On his poem being misattributed, Iyer said, \"I'm not as concerned about the misattribution as long as it doesn't cascade into people hounding his [Abhinandan's] family at this testing time for a quote/byte. They deserve our respect and the issue the piece talks about is more important than claiming credit for it.\"Iyer has posted another poem today titled \"Perhaps We Can\" on his Facebook wall along with #WelcomeHomeAbhinandan and today's date - 01.03.2019.Times Fact Check has found that the poem about WC Abhinandan credited to his sister Aditi, that is being widely shared across social media platforms and WhatsApp, was actually written by Varun Ram Iyer.", "lang": "en"}
