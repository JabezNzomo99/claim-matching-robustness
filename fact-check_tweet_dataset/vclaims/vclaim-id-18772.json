Kamala Harris. The quote \u2014 about seeking \u201cvengeance\u201d against supporters of President Donald Trump \u2014 originated on a website that calls its work satire.\n\nA statement first attributed to Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris in a made-up story is now making the rounds on social media as if it\u2019s real.\n\nThe bogus Facebook posts claim that Harris, a 2020 presidential candidate, said at a rally that she will seek \u201cvengeance\u201d against supporters of President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cAnd once he\u2019s gone and we have regained our rightful place in the White House, look out if you supported him and endorsed his actions, because we\u2019ll be coming for you next,\u201d the supposed quotation reads. \u201cYou will feel the vengeance of a nation. No stone will be left unturned as we seek you out in every corner of this great nation. For it is you who have betrayed us.\u201d\n\nSome users shared that text in image form while others published their own text posts repeating it.\n\nBut the quote was lifted directly from an Aug. 7 story on bustatroll.org, which is part of a network of websites that calls its work satire. We\u2019ve written many times about content from America\u2019s Last Line of Defense being wrongly treated as real news.\n\n\u201cKamala Harris: \u2018After We Impeach, We Round Up The Trump Supporters,'\u201d the story\u2019s headline reads. While Harris has supported beginning impeachment proceedings against Trump, the story presents an otherwise imagined tale about a Harris speech.\n\nBustatroll.org includes disclaimers that its work is fiction and the nameplate above the story says \u201csatire rated.\u201d A story tag also reads, \u201cThe truth is right in front of you.\u201d\n\nThe posts spreading the quote on social media, however, offer no such warnings or indications of its origins.\n\nFacebook users largely responded to the false statement with expressions of outrage. Commenters called Harris \u201cmentally disturbed\u201d and \u201cdumb,\u201d among other things. Some accused her of \u201cinciting violence\u201d and used the quote to defend gun rights.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
