He added that there will be no hidden costs.\n\n\"Students from the higher secondary to the postgraduate level, including medical, engineering and polytechnic students, will be admitted to institutes for free,\" Sarma was quoted as saying a day after the results for Class 10 state board examinations were announced only on online platforms.\n\nIt was also stated that the prospectus and admission forms will be available online free of cost.\n\nFor those staying in hostels, the Education Department will also pay Rs 1,000 as monthly mess dues and an additional amount of Rs 1,000 will be provided to all students for buying textbooks.\n\n\"All the students must mention their bank details in the admission forms so that the matter can be taken up from the initial stage and there is no delay in depositing money in their bank accounts,\" he said.\n\nStudents who passed the Class 10 examinations last year will be given computers in their school and those who have cleared the test this year will get Rs 20,000 so that they can buy computers of their choice, Sarma said.\n\nBelow is a statement from the minister:", "lang": "en"}
