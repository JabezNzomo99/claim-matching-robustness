Steve Warren told Polygraph.info that the U.S. Defense Department will use its authorities under the Global Security Contingency Fund as part of a joint DoD-State Department initiative to strengthen Ukraine's internal defense capabilities.\n\n\u200b \u201cWe plan on sending about 290 U.S. service members, specifically paratroopers from the [Army\u2019s] mighty 173rd \u2018Sky Soldiers\u2019 Airborne Brigade based in Vicenza, Italy,\u201d Warren said.
