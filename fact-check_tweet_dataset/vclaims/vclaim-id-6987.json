No, that's not exactly true. Local media reports indicate a man and his son first attacked staff at the restaurant after they had asked them to put away the alcohol they had brought with them.\n\nVideo of the incident went viral after local far-right politician Filip Dewinter tweeted it with a misleading caption claiming the man was being beaten up just for drinking alcohol:\n\nThe video was picked up by other accounts minutes later:\n\nWe archived that tweet here.\n\nHowever, this local media report from Gazet van Antwerpen sheds a different light on the events:\n\nTranslation of the headline: \"Father and son taken to hospital after fight on Roosevelt Square\".\n\nBoth gentlemen were drinking something on the terrace of a kebab shop while under the influence of alcohol. Because no alcohol was being served there the owner took it up with them. The son then allegedly punched an employee of the shop several times who then headbutted back. This caused a fight to break out that quickly escalated as the two were harshly dealt with after several people started throwing with terrace chairs.\n\nSo technically they were not attacked for drinking alcohol but for starting a fight with restaurant staff after being told they were not allowed to bring their own drinks.", "lang": "en"}
