Col Abdul Qayoum Nooristani, Afghan Special Operation Corps spokesperson, told the VOA Extremism Watch Desk that the operation was conducted not by the U.S. but by the Afghan troops, and that the Islamic State members then have been transferred under the control of the Afghan Intelligence Agency \u2013 the National Directorate of Security.\n\nOn January 13, the Afghan Special Operations Corps released a statement, saying that, \u201cThe Afghan Special Operations\u2019 first brigade conducted a nighttime special operation in the vicinity of Ghorb village, Jawand district of northern Badghis province.\u201d\n\nThe special operations corps stated, \u201c11 Taliban terrorist were killed and 36 Islamic State members, including 18 men, 6 women and 12 children, kept as captives by Taliban, were arrested and transferred to National Directorate of Security.\u201d\n\n\u200bThere is no mention of any U.S. troops taking part in the operation, though the Afghan military \u201calways makes clear\u201d when such operations are conducted jointly with the coalition or the U.S. forces, a journalist from the VOA Extremism Watch Desk, an expert on Afghanistan, told Polygraph.info.\n\nThe Pentagon did not respond to a Polygraph.info inquiry regarding the operation. Reports on the death of a U.S. Army Ranger, Sgt. Cameron Meddock, in Afghanistan on January 13 raise some question whether U.S. soldiers might have been in the vicinity. The Army Times website said Meddock was killed by \u201csmall-arms fire\u201d in an operation in Badghis province, but did not mention the attack on a Taliban prison by the Afghan Special Forces.\n\nAlso in January, Russian Interior Ministry\u2019s representative Igor Zubov said that, \u201cunidentified helicopters in Pakistan are transporting Islamic State fighters massively\u201d to the border of Tajikistan to prepare an offensive in that Central Asian country, with an aim at destabilizing Russia, information similar to the foreign ministry\u2019s debunked statement but naming a different Central Asian country as the destination for IS transfers.\n\nThe Radio Free Europe\u2019s Tajik service investigated the Russian assertions finding no merit in the claim that the United States military was behind such a move.\n\nThe Commander of the Afghanistan Defense Ministry\u2019s 209 Division General, Alimohammad Akhmadzai told RFE/RL, that the coalition and Afghan forces have been conducting airstrikes in the northern provinces against the ISIL compounds but there are still terrorist strongholds remaining in the region.\n\nIn mid-January, the Russian Foreign Ministry alleged (based on a statement by the Taliban), that the U.S. military \u201cliberated\u201d a group of ISIL terrorist from a prison in northern Afghanistan and transported them on helicopters to an unknown location. Polygraph.info looked into the Russian claim but found no proof to support it.\n\nThe report by Komsomolskaya Pravda appears to be mirroring a less specific statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry on January 16 that meandered from Syria to Afghanistan. Polygraph.info debunked the claim shortly afterwards, yet Russian officials and state media continue to repeat it.\n\nThe narrative has been constantly present in the Russian Defense and Foreign Ministries\u2019 public statements, many of which Polygraph.info has investigated and debunked. Well over a year ago, a Russian official, without evidence, said the U.S. was using an Islamic State group to destabilize \u201cthe situation in Central Asia.\u201d\n\nLast year, there was a similar claim in Russian state media of mysterious helicopters supposedly providing support to Islamic State fighters. Polygraph.info verified the video published by the Russian state media agency Sputnik showed a helicopter, which was not U.S military.", "lang": "en"}
