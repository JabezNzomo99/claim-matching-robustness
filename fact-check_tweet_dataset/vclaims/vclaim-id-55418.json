This isn\u2019t how people normally talk about spending increases, and it makes the figure seem comparatively much larger than it really is.\n\nLast week the figure was used again in an ad campaign run by the Conservative Party (the ads have been deactivated following a separate article we wrote about how they seemed to alter the headline of a BBC news article).\n\nAs well as repeating the \u00a314 billion claim, the ads made two new factual claims: that this is a \u201crecord\u201d amount, and that this is \u201clevelling up per pupil funding across the country\u201d.\n\nThe proposed spending increase is not a record amount when you take into account inflation and rising pupil numbers (which is the most meaningful measure). Per pupil spending will increase to roughly the level it was at in 2009/10.\n\nIf you don\u2019t adjust for pupil numbers, it\u2019s hard to say whether or not the spending increase is a \u201crecord\u201d, because we don\u2019t have good historical data. It\u2019s unclear exactly what the Conservative Party meant when it said \u201crecord\u201d and we\u2019ve asked it for more information.\n\nWhat spending has been pledged?\n\nThe Conservatives outlined spending increases in schools in England which total \u00a314 billion over three years.\n\nThis \u00a314 billion figure isn\u2019t the most helpful way of looking at the numbers and is potentially misleading for a few reasons.\n\nFor one, it does not account for inflation. Also, it adds together all of the increases in spending for every year between now and 2022/23 (so the increase between 2019/20 and 2020/21, as well as 2019/20 and 2021/22, and so on.) The standard practice for discussing spending changes is to talk about them on a per year basis.\n\nOnce you factor these things in, spending will be \u00a34.3 billion higher in 2022/23 than in 2019/20 in real terms. The IFS told us that\u2019s roughly a 10% increase over the three years on schools spending.\n\nEven this figure isn\u2019t a perfect way of looking at school spending. It doesn\u2019t account for rising pupil numbers. As pupil numbers increase over time, the most meaningful way of looking at school spending is the amount spent \u201cper pupil\u201d.\n\nSo the best measure to use is real-terms per-pupil spending. The IFS has said that, by this measure, schools spending is going to rise by around 7.4% per pupil by 2022/23.\n\nThe IFS said \u201cSince 2009-10, school spending per pupil has fallen by 8% in real-terms in England. The new spending plans should be near enough sufficient to reverse these cuts by 2022-23. In addition, the government is continuing to provide compensation to schools for higher pension contributions on top of this.\n\n\u201cThis package represents a large increase in spending per pupil, taking it back to about the same level it was in 2009-10. However, a 13-year period of no net growth in school spending per pupil, after inflation, still represents a significant squeeze on school budgets when considered in historical terms.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201crecord\u201d could mean that the increase in spending is larger than schools have ever been given over a comparable time frame.\n\nThere is no good consistent data to judge school spending over time, so it\u2019s hard to say whether or not \u00a34.3 billion is the largest ever increase over three years.\n\nHowever, as mentioned above, the best measure of school funding is the amount in real terms per pupil. Although the planned increase will be \u201clarge\u201d as the IFS put it, it won\u2019t be a record. Spending per pupil rose by 13.6% between 2004/05 and 2007/08. This was also a larger increase in absolute terms per pupil.\n\nWhat else could \"record\" mean?\n\nAlternatively, \u201crecord\u201d could mean that following the government\u2019s planned spending increases up to 2022/23 the total schools budget will be larger than they\u2019ve ever been before.\n\nThat\u2019s technically correct, but not very meaningful. It isn\u2019t unusual for government budgets to get bigger year-on-year, as they tend to go up over time as overall spending increases and, in the case of schools, pupil numbers increase.\n\nTo get a better sense of how far that money can go we need to look at schools spending accounting for inflation and the spending per pupil.\n\nAs we\u2019ve touched on, analysis published by the IFS shows that the per pupil spend in 2022/23 will be almost at 2009/10 levels, though not quite as high. 2009/10 saw the highest per pupil spend in any year since 2003/04, which is the furthest back the IFS were able to analyse comparable figures.", "lang": "en"}
