Wake up before it\u2019s too late, \u201d the caption read.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the above post and found that the claim is misleading.\n\nWe put the image through a Reverse Image Search and found that the pictures are from Rome.\n\nThe same pictures were uploaded by Roma Today on their Facebook page on February 5, 2020.\n\nAccording to the article, the incident took place on Viale del Policlinico, a road in Rome on February 4, 2020. Italian media outlets reported that a tree fell over due to strong winds, injuring a man and killing a group of birds who had made their nest in that tree.\n\nThe incident was covered by several other local media outlets. Il Messaggero also uploaded a video captured on the location.\n\nOn further investigation, we also found a post by the Wildlife Recovery Center \u2013 LIPU (Italian League for Bird Protection), explaining as to what could have happened.\n\n\u201cThe most probable hypothesis is that the very strong wind, which was already swaying the branches of the tree, made hundreds of sleeping animals resting on it lose their sense of direction and probably did not perceive that they were falling together with the tree. If we also consider that it was dark and that the animals were still sleeping, it is normal that they were taken by surprise by such an unexpected event.\n\n All the specimens that arrived and those who died on the spot had traumatic injuries or injuries, none had symptoms of intoxication or poisoning and indeed all, apart from the injuries, were in a perfect state of health also because they are preparing to leave for the migration that will bring them to reproduce in northern Europe \u201d the post read.\n\nMoreover, as per the WHO website, \u201cto date, and after much research performed, no adverse health effect has been causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies.\u201d\n\nThis proves that the above picture of birds has nothing to do with Coronavirus or 5G network.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
