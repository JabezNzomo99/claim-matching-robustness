AVOID GOING DAW MUNA SA EDSA SHANG MALL. Nagkapatient siya this morning galing from business trip from China. Nagpacheck up then meron SARS huhu so super contagious daw even Healthway reported it sa admin ng Shang,\" the message read.\n\nThe message continued: \"Now ayaw ilabas publicly pero pinapalinis ng Shang buong 5th floor near Healthway. But sabi ng doctor it can be passed on by simply sa nahawakan na buttons sa elevator, doorknobs, and other things. As per the doctor na friend ni papa wala daw mask 'yung patient niya kanina 'cause he didn't know na SARS, so possibly via air pwede din.\"\n\nThe message was circulated via private messaging. At least two Facebook posts are also available online \u2013 one from Facebook page Vic Sotto (unofficial, not owned and not managed by the actor) and one from a personal account. Neither named the original source of the information.\n\nHealthway Medical also released a statement on Tuesday that said there has been \"no reported case of SARS in any Healthway clinic including Shangri-La branch.\" The clinic also urged the public to verify information they find online before spreading them.\n\nOn Tuesday, the World Health Organization warned that the new China coronavirus could spread. The organization said \"limited human-to-human transmission\" is possible especially among families, but no sustained human-to-human transmission has been reported so far.", "lang": "en"}
