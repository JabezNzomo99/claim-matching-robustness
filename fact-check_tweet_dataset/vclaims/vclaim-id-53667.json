Messages suggesting Cadbury is giving out free hampers on its anniversary have been circulating on social media with many people even believing these claims.\n\nCadbury is not distributing free chocolates. This isn't the first time such a false message is in circulation. These messages have been shared in the past as well. \n\n\n\nBOOM received several messages with different claims on its WhatsApp helpline (+917700906111)\n\nSome of the messages claimed that Cadbury was giving out 500 hampers, some said 1500 free hampers, another said 12 free chocolate boxes to everyone as it is their 110th anniversary.\n\nThe links, however discuss the distribution of 500 free hampers by Cadbury for their anniversary.\n\nBOOM contacted Mondelez India, the manufacturers of Cadbury for an official statement surrounding this viral message.\n\n\"Mondelez India would like to confirm that this is a fake website link in circulation under the Cadbury name promising free chocolates. We are not running any such promotion. We advise consumer caution before opening the link or sharing it further. For any further queries, consumers can also write to us at suggestions@mdlz.com\"\n\nThis is not the first time Cadbury has faced the brunt of false social media messages. In 2018, Cadbury was accused of spreading HIV. A Nigerian man was falsely claimed to be an employee of Cadbury who had injected his HIV-laden blood into the chocolates. BOOM debunked the story and the spokesperson at Mondelez had laid these rumours to rest.\n\nAmazon, Jet Airways have also fallen prey to such hoax messages in the past where claims were made about free offers to their customers. BOOM had then spoken to the companies who clarified that they had made no such offers.", "lang": "en"}
