The Clinton Foundation, by contrast, is a large public charity; it does not dole out grants but instead allocates the donations it raises directly to specified charitable activities, such as promoting economic development and global health. So it\u2019s already a matter of apples and oranges when making simplistic comparisons about expenses.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump Foundation did have some expenses \u2014 $56,163 between 2006 and 2016, virtually all ($56,000) in accounting fees, according to its tax filings. That works out to about 0.43 percent of the $12.7 million in outgoing donations in that period. That\u2019s pretty good, but it\u2019s not 0.0 percent. Given the foundation\u2019s legal travails, one might argue that it should have spent more than $163 in legal fees in that period.\n\nAs our colleague David Fahrenthold first reported in his Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting on the Trump Foundation, Trump did not donate any money to the foundation between 2008 and 2015 and most of its money was not actually his. By law, Trump wasn\u2019t allowed to buy things for himself using the charity\u2019s money, even if he was buying them from nonprofit groups.\n\nBut Trump twice used the charity\u2019s money to settle legal disputes that involved his for-profit businesses, the New York attorney general alleged. He also engaged in other instances of self-dealing, such as paying $10,000 to buy a portrait of Trump that was found hanging in one of his golf resorts. The foundation also donated $25,000 to a Florida political group aiding the reelection effort of state Attorney General Pam Bondi (R) \u2014 and was used to benefit his presidential campaign, the lawsuit said.\n\nParscale\u2019s chart lists as a source a 2015 New York Post article that was titled \u201cCharity watchdog: Clinton Foundation a \u2018slush fund.\u2019\u201d The article was pegged to the announcement that Charity Navigator, which rates nonprofits, decided to put the Clinton Foundation on its \u201cwatch list.\u201d The group took the action after media reports raised troubling questions about the running of the foundation and the foundation spun off some entities and later bought some, according to a 2015 interview with our colleagues at FactCheck.org.\n\nAllison told The Fact Checker he was referring to media coverage, in particular a Washington Post report that revealed that Bill Clinton was paid at least $26 million in speaking fees by companies and organizations that are also major donors to the foundation. A memo written by a top Clinton aide, leaked by WikiLeaks in 2016, further exposed the inner workings of \u201cBill Clinton Inc.,\u201d in which donors to the Clinton Foundation were pressed to provide personal income to the former president.\n\n\u201cIt was highly unusual to me and ethically challenged,\u201d Allison said, adding that he stood by the quote. But he noted that he made the \u201cslush-fund\u201d comment in the course of a 20-minute conversation. \u201cWhat was robbed from the context of the quote is that I did say that the Clinton Foundation did good work,\u201d he said.\n\nIn any case, by the end of 2015, Charity Navigator removed the Clinton Foundation from its watch list. The organization indicated that tax information made available by the Clinton Foundation, including four years of tax returns amended by the organization, as well as a public memo submitted by the group, met Charity Navigator\u2019s requirements for removal.\n\nThe New York Post report claimed that the Clinton Foundation took $140 million in grants and pledges in 2013 but spent just $9 million on direct aid, based on 2013 tax filings. But as we explained, it is a public charity. The ratio of 6.4 percent toward charities and 93.6 percent toward expenses, suggested by the tax form and repeated in the chart, is based on a misreading of the tax documents filed by the foundation.\n\nFor 2016, according to tax documents and audited financial statements, the Clinton Foundation spent 88 percent of its cash budget on programs, compared to 12 percent on overhead, such as fundraising, management and expenses. The organization also calculated that it costs the Clinton Foundation only $2 for every $100 it raises.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of where data can lie, if presented in a misleading fashion. Parscale\u2019s chart compares apples and oranges \u2014 and then offers an expense-charity ratio for the Clinton Foundation that is virtually backward. One could raise legitimate questions about the Clinton Foundation without resorting to phony math \u2014 or ignoring the well-documented issues with the running of the Trump Foundation.
