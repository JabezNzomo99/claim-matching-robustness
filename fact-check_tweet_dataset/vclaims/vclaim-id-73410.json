However Special trains will continue to run,\u201d the caption read.\n\nNewsMobile fact-checked the post and found the claim to be false.\n\nRubbishing the claim, Ministry of Railways, in a tweet dated August 10, 2020, clarified that the message in circulation is incorrect.\n\nThe ministry clarified that as of August 10, 2020, no new circular has been issued by Ministry of Railways regarding the extension of cancellation of trains.\n\n\u201cSome section of media is reporting that Railways has cancelled all regular trains till 30th September. This is not correct. No new circular has been issued by Ministry of Railways. Special Mail Express trains shall continue to run,\u201d the tweet read.\n\nIn a letter issued by the Indian Railway in June, regular time-tabled passenger services including Mail/Express, passenger and suburban services were cancelled till August 12, 2020.\n\nIt should be noted that the time-tabled passenger services were cancelled from March 23, following the nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19.\n\nHence, from the above fact check, it is clear that the post in question is fake.", "lang": "en"}
