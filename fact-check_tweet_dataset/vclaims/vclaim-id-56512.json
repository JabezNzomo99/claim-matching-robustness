The claim is false; Indian officials said the posts were \u201cmisleading and false\u201d; AFP found two of the purported sections of the law cited in the misleading posts do not exist under the act and the other does not mention a social media ban related to COVID-19 content.\n\nThe post was published here on Facebook on April 7, 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post states, in part: \u201cGroup admin is requested to close group for 2days as police can take action against admin & group members vide section 68, 140 & 188 if anyone even by mistake post joke on corona.\u201d\n\n\u201cMandate for All: Tonight 12 ( midnight) onwards Disaster Management Act has been implemented across the country. According to this update, apart from the Govt department no other citizen is allowed to post any update or share any forward related to Corona virus and it being punishable offence\u2026 https://www.livelaw.in/\u2026/centre-seeks-sc-direction-that-no-\u201d\n\nThe website in the post directs users to a report published on March 31, 2020 on Live Law, a website covering legal news in India.\n\nAs of April 14, 2020, COVID-19 has killed at least 117,000 people and infected more than 1.8 million others, according to this report published by World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nIn response, India imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 24, 2020 in a bid to curb the growing COVID-19 epidemic. Here is an AFP report on the government announcement.\n\nA similar claim was also shared here and here on Facebook and here and here on Twitter.\n\nThe claim is false. India's Ministry of Home Affairs invoked the Disaster Management Act, as seen in this statement, as it imposed the 21-day lockdown.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the relevant part of the release:\n\nHowever, while the misleading post mentions sections 68, 140 and 188, AFP found that sections 140 and 188 do not exist under the act.\n\nA section 68 does exist, but there is no mention of a social media ban. It states: \u201cEvery order or decision of the National Authority or the National Executive Committee, the State Authority, or the State Executive Committee or the District Authority, shall be authenticated by such officers of the National Authority or the National Executive Committee or, the State Executive Committee, or the District Authority, as may be authorised by it in this behalf.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of section 68 of the act in the government release:\n\nAFP also found that the Live Law report mentioned in the misleading post does not mention an immediate ban on social media posts.\n\nIt instead discusses how the Indian Supreme Court denied the Indian home secretary\u2019s request to \u201cissue a direction\u201d that would require \u201celectronic/print media/web portal or social media\u201d to first seek \u201cthe true factual position from the Central government\u201d before publishing anything about COVID-19. The Court responded it \"does not intend to interfere with the free discussion about the pandemic\", but did \"direct the media to refer to and publish the official version\".\n\nOn April 6, 2020, a spokesperson for Live Law posted on Twitter that the claims were \u201cfake\u201d and published its own debunk here.\n\nA similar misleading claim that circulated in India about social media posts during the COVID-19 pandemic was previously debunked by AFP here.\n\nIndia\u2019s official Press Information Bureau also denied the claims in this tweet published April 2, 2020, saying: \u201cMessages circulating on social media claiming-apart from Govt no citizen is allowed to post/forward update on #COVID19- is MISLEADING & FALSE. Circulating unverified/false news leading to panic is prohibited. As responsible Citizens let's not circulate fake forwards.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
