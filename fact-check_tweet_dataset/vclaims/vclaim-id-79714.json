So we'll go with the generally agreed upon definition: producing as much energy as is consumed domestically.\n\nSeveral recent months have seen U.S. energy production outstrip consumption \u2014 which supports Trump\u2019s claim. But overall, the data cuts against the notion that the United States is \"very energy independent.\"\n\nIn the first five months of 2019, the United States used more energy than it produced. Specifically, the country produced 41.5 quadrillion British thermal units of energy, but consumed 42.1 quadrillion BTUs, according to the most recent data from the Energy Information Administration.\n\nSome individual months have seen the United States achieve \"energy independence,\" in the sense of producing more energy than Americans consumed. Two months in fall 2018 did so, and the United States produced more than it consumed in April and May of this year.\n\nThe United States has been a net energy importer since 1953. But according to the Energy Information Administration, that\u2019s likely to soon change. The EIA projects that with continued growth in American petroleum and natural gas exports, plus slow growth in U.S. energy consumption, the country is on track to become a net energy exporter by next year.\n\nData from the last decade points to the country trending in that direction too. The gap between U.S. energy production and consumption has been narrowing for some time, and achieved even greater parity during Trump's presidency.\n\nThat said, some experts argue it\u2019s not in the United States\u2019 best interest to be totally disengaged from the foreign energy market \u2014 for instance, when hurricanes in the Gulf threaten domestic sources.\n\n\"Without energy imports, we could not run our system optimally,\" said Frank Verrastro, an energy and national security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nStill, given Trump\u2019s campaign promise to achieve energy independence, he\u2019s eager to claim a victory \u2014 and his claim may be on ever sturdier ground as Election Day 2020 approaches. But to say the United States right now is \"very energy independent\" is a touchdown celebration before reaching the end zone.\n\nTrump said the United States is \"very energy independent.\"\n\nIt\u2019s somewhat premature to label the United States energy independent given that Americans consumed more energy than the country produced for most of the last year that we have data. But the gap between U.S. energy production and consumption has been narrowing for some time, particularly during Trump\u2019s presidency, and data shows several recent months where production outpaced American energy use.", "lang": "en"}
