Cyclone Amphan has made landfall in West Bengal on 20 May 2020, causing severe damage in the coastal areas of West Bengal and Odisha. Let\u2019s fact-check whether the videos in the posts are related to Cyclone Amphan.\n\nIt was found that the video in the post is old and not related to the recent cyclone. The video shows Cyclone Fani battering coastal areas of Odisha last year. Cyclone Fani, an extremely severe cyclonic storm, has caused large scale damage in large parts of coastal Odisha and made landfall in Puri on 03 May 2019.\n\nIt was found that a news channel has published the same video in October 2018 with the title \u2013 \u2018Video shows Hurricane Michael tearing home apart in Panama City Beach\u2019. Also, the same video can be found on multiple stock video websites with the description that it is related to Hurricane Michael.\n\nTo sum it up, old videos are being falsely shared in the context of Cyclone Amphan.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
