In the viral picture, Prime Minister Modi can be seen wearing UAE\u2019s famous regional headgear keffiyeh.\n\nThe post claims that PM Modi wore this keffiyeh on his head in the UAE. When we investigated, we found that this claim is false. With the help of editing tools, Modi\u2019s picture has been tampered with and this keffiyeh was pasted on the original photo. The real picture is of 24 August when Khaldoon Khalifa Al Mubarak welcomed the Indian Prime Minister and his delegation at the Presidential Terminal of Abu Dhabi International Airport. PM Modi did not wear anything on his head in the real picture.\n\nIn the viral picture, Prime Minister Narendra Modi can be seen walking with Abu Dhabi\u2019s Executive Affairs Authority Chairman, Khaldoon Khalifa Al Mubarak. In the viral picture, Prime Minister Modi can be seen wearing UAE\u2019s famous regional headgear keffiyeh. The post claimed, \u201cMuslim skullcaps are forbidden in India but not in the UAE\u201d.\n\nTo start our investigation, we searched this image on Google reverse image. We found this picture on all the big news websites. But the difference was that Modi did not wear anything on his head in the photo used on these websites. The man accompanying PM Modi in the photograph is Khaloon Khalifa Al Mubarak, Chairman of the Executive Affairs Authority of Abu Dhabi, who welcomed the Indian Prime Minister and the accompanying delegation at the Presidential Terminal of Abu Dhabi International Airport.\n\nWe also found this picture on Dainik Jagran\u2019s website.\n\nYou can see the difference between the two pictures below.\n\nLet us tell you that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was on a tri-nation visit last week. He visited France, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain from Aug 22-Aug 26. Meanwhile, this picture was taken when he reached the UAE on 24 August.\n\nThis original picture was first posted from the verified Twitter handle of Prime Minister Modi, which was later edited by mischievous elements using editing tools like Photoshop.\n\nFor more clarification, we spoke with BJP\u2019s IT in-charge Amit Malviya, who described it as a work of mischievous elements.\n\nThe post was shared by a Facebook page called Voice of Muslim. This page has a total of 46,265 followers.\n\nConclusion: We investigated and found that this claim is false. With the help of editing tools, Modi\u2019s picture has been tampered with and this keffiyeh was pasted on the original photo. The real picture is of 24 August when Khaldoon Khalifa Al Mubarak welcomed the Prime Minister Modi and his delegation at the Presidential Terminal of Abu Dhabi International Airport. PM Modi did not wear anything on his head in the real picture.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right. If you have a doubt on any news that could impact you, society or the nation, let us know.
