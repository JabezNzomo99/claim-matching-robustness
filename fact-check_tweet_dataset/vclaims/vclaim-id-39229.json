Let\u2019s check the veracity of the claim made in the post. \n\n\n\nClaim: Images of a 24-year-old girl who has become an IAS officer in Maharashtra. Fact: The girl in the images is Sahrish Kanwal. She is 14 years old. She was made District Superintendent of Police (DSP) \u2018for a day\u2019 in Maharashtra ahead of the International Women\u2019s Day. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWhen the images are subjected to Google reverse image search technique, the search results were obtained about a 14-year-old girl who was made as a DSP in Maharashtra for a day. Those results can be seen here and here. As per the \u2018Times of India\u2019 video, a 14-year-old girl Sahrish Kanwal was made as a District Superintendent of Police (DSP) \u2018for a day\u2019 in Buldhana district of Maharashtra. This initiative was taken by the District Collector Suman Chandra ahead of International Women\u2019s Day. So, the girl in the video is 14 years old and she was made DSP only \u2018for a day\u2019.\n\n\n\nThe photos of that event can also be seen in the tweet posted by the Buldhana Police.\n\n\n\nTo conclude, images of a 14-year-old girl who was made DSP \u2018for a day\u2019 in Maharashtra are being shared with a false claim.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
