This is false; the logo features an aardvark according to the company that runs the testing facilities.\n\nThe post, shared more than 25,000 times in the United States and more than 3,000 times in Canada in the last week, shows pictures of a COVID-19 mobile testing booth often accompanied by the question, \u201cWhy does the COVID-19 testing facility have a logo of Anubis the god of death?\u201d\n\nIt has also been shared in Argentina, Brazil, Columbia, France, Germany, Italy, Serbia, South Africa, the United Kingdom,\n\nA separate depiction of Anubis, the jackal-like Egyptian \u201cdeity of cemeteries, embalming and protector of graves,\u201d is shared alongside it.\n\nA reverse image search of the testing facility photograph on Google found this tweet by a company called Aardvark Mobile Tours, which offers vehicle-based marketing solutions.\n\nAccording to their website, Aardvark, based in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, adapted their mobile platform business in response to the coronavirus pandemic by designing two trucks as mobile testing centers.\n\nThe trucks were featured in the Miami Herald and were photographed in Florida by AFP\u2019s Chandan Khanna on July 24, 2020.\n\n\u201cThe testing trucks have a silhouette of an Aardvark because the company behind the trucks is Aardvark Mobile Health, a division of Aardvark Mobile Tours,\u201d a spokeswoman for the company told AFP via email.\n\n\u201cThe logo for Aardvark Mobile Tours was created in 2007 and includes the Aardvark head \u2013 which is what you see in the COVID-19 testing logo,\u201d she added.\n\nThe company also says it does not attach any symbolism to the logo of the aardvark, a long-snouted nocturnal creature native to Africa.\n\n\u201cLarry Borden, the founder and CEO, actually chose the name \u2018Aardvark\u2019 originally because of the double \u2018A\u2019 at the beginning, meaning the company would show up at the beginning of the phone book,\u201d said the spokeswoman.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked more than 570 examples of false or misleading information about the novel coronavirus.
