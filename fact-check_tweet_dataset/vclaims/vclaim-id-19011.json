Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t take long for false rumors and conspiracy theories about the tragedy to proliferate across the internet.\n\nAs politicians commented on the shootings and mused about a potential link with violent video games, a viral Facebook post spread a fake quote attributed to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarth, R-Calif.).\n\nThe post purports to show a recent Fox News interview in which McCarthy said there are \"no mass shootings in Japan because there are no video games there.\" The post\u2019s caption reads: \"HOW ARE REPUBLICANS EVEN REAL.\"\n\nThe post, which has been shared over 6,000 times, was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

While McCarthy did say that violent video games dehumanize players and can be a factor in mass shootings, he never mentioned that in the context of Japan. We don\u2019t find anything close to this quote in his Aug. 4 appearance on Fox News\u2019 show \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"\n\nAt one point, McCarthy responded to a question from host Maria Bartiromo about the role video games play in violent behavior. (Read our fact-check about research disproving such a link.)\n\n\"The idea that these video games that dehumanize individuals to have a game of shooting individuals and others ... I\u2019ve always felt that is a problem for future generations and others,\" McCarthy responded. \"We\u2019ve watched from studies shown before of what it does to individuals. When you look at these photos of how it took place, you can see the actions within video games and others.\"\n\nWhile mentioning video games, McCarthy did not mention Japan in the Bartiromo interview after the shootings.\n\nThe Facebook post\u2019s claim came from a screenshot of a tweet that has since been deleted.\n\nThis faux quote is Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
