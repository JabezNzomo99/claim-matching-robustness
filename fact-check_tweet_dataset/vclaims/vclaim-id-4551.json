The report notes that performance improves in weaker schools, but \"higher performing schools make less progress and the very highest drop back.\" These important points seem to have got lost in the discussion that followed, and are not reflected in Policy Exchange's headline conclusion and the Prime Minister's claim.\n\nDo free schools raise standards in other schools?\n\nTo answer this question, Policy Exchange looks at a new free school and finds the three nearest similar schools. They do this for all free schools approved in a particular year, and track the progress of those nearby schools from the year the free school is approved up to 2014.\n\nWe're talking about small groups here: typically between 20 and 30 free schools of each type open each year; that means comparing between 60 and 90 neighbouring schools. We'd expect figures to be quite variable given these small sample sizes and Policy Exchange advise treating the results with caution.\n\nFor secondary schools that were performing worse than average, those with a free school nearby improved more than similarly-attaining schools nationally. But by the same measure, successful schools with a free school nearby improved less than other such schools nationally. These effects cancel each other out so overall neighbouring schools perform in line with the national level.\n\nThe picture is similar for primary schools near free schools: the lowest-performing made more progress while higher performing schools made less progress than would be expected nationally.\n\nThere is no proof that free schools themselves were the cause of any change in performance in other schools nearby.\n\nPolicy Exchange suggests that free schools might be raising standards through competition with local schools. But there's nothing in this argument specific to free schools: local competition could also be achieved by opening a new maintained school or academy in the area, or by the arrival of a new headteacher in an existing school. The report doesn't compare the effects of new free schools with other new schools, so there's nothing to show whether free schools are necessarily better.\n\nDo free schools raise standards for themselves?\n\nAs we've said previously, it's too early to say whether free schools fare better than other schools under Ofsted inspections. Just 76 schools, less than a third of the total, have been inspected and given judgements so far. That figure excludes two free schools which were judged inadequate before later closing.\n\nOf those that are open, not enough free schools have exam results yet to begin comparing them to other schools.\n\nFree schools are only a small part of the picture, with just over 250 currently open out of more than 24,000 schools in England. As the Education Select Committee pointed out, even opening a further 500 free schools would only bring the proportion to 3% of all schools in England, and that assumes that no other schools open in the same period, which seems unlikely given the projected increases in primary and secondary student populations.\n\nAfter digesting ten sessions of oral evidence and around 140 written submissions, the Education Select Committee reported in January 2015 that:\n\nThat's the fairest summary of the evidence we've seen so far.", "lang": "en"}
