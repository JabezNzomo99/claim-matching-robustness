Bernie Sanders, whom he falsely called a \"communist,\" but that the matchup was looking less likely. Fox News will host a town hall with Sanders on March 9 in Detroit, Mich.\n\nThe town hall included some critical questions by audience members. One undecided voter told Trump at the \"outset of the coronavirus, your administration\u2019s response seemed to some as being confusing or minimizing.\" Another asked Trump if his message could be delivered without \"controversial rhetoric.\"\n\nTrump presented himself as a leader who inherited a heap of problems from Barack Obama and delivered on his campaign promises anyway. We fact-checked several of his misleading or inaccurate claims.\n\nThis is misleading. The Gallup poll is from the first half of February, before any American died within the United States, and before major news reports about flaws in early CDC test kits.\n\nA Gallup poll conducted Feb. 3-16 found that three in four Americans said they were very confident (31%) or somewhat confident (46%) in the federal government's ability to handle an outbreak of the coronavirus. The poll included a random sample of 1,028 adults and a margin of error of 4 percentage points.\n\nThe poll started days after the Trump administration announced it would suspend entry of foreign nationals into the U.S. among those who had traveled to China in the prior two weeks. The poll took place before any deaths within the U.S., although one American died in China in the middle of the polling period. According to the CDC as of March 5, there were a total of 99 cases in the U.S., 10 deaths and cases in 13 states.\n\nA more recent poll, done by MorningConsult, shows that approval of Trump\u2019s response has been dropping. The Feb. 28-March 1 survey showed that 49% of voters approved of Trump\u2019s response to the outbreak, down from 56% in a Feb. 24-26 survey \u2014 a decline fueled by drops among independents and Democrats.\n\nThe new Morning Consult poll surveyed 1,997 registered voters and carries a margin of error of two percentage points.\n\nThere is some good news for the federal government in the most recent poll: a majority of voters approve of the CDC\u2019s handling the spread of coronavirus, Trump declaring a public health emergency and seeking emergency funding, and appointing Pence to coordinate U.S. efforts\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during a FOX News Channel town hall at the Scranton Cultural Center, March 5, 2020, in Scranton, Pa. (AP/Evan Vucci)\n\nTrump misleads when he portrays Hunter Biden as unemployed when he joined the board of a natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, in 2014. At the time, Hunter Biden was a counsel to Boies, Schiller and Flexner, a national law firm based in New York, according to a statement from Burisma. He was also chairman of the board of Rosemont Seneca Advisors and an adjunct professor at Georgetown University\u2019s master\u2019s program in the school of foreign service.\n\nHunter Biden was discharged from the Navy Reserve in 2014 following a failed drug test for cocaine.\n\nThe details of how much Hunter Biden was paid by Burisma have been part of the mystery surrounding what he did on the board. Experts have said that Hunter\u2019s position on the board presented a serious conflict of interest for his father when he was vice president and engaging in Ukraine. However, there has been no finding of wrongdoing by his father and no charge of specific wrongdoing against Hunter Biden.\n\nThis lacks evidence. We have looked at Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in China and found no evidence that he actually obtained $1.5 billion.\n\nA Wall Street Journal article in July 2014 reported that Hunter Biden\u2019s firm was \"aiming to raise about $1.5 billion.\" This means that, a full six months after Hunter Biden left China, the $1.5 billion figure was aspirational, not confirmed. This undermines Trump\u2019s version of events, which is that Biden quickly pocketed $1.5 billion after a meeting while the elder Biden was vice president.\n\nThis is False. Sanders is not a communist.\n\nExperts said there are clear differences between Sanders\u2019 democratic socialism \u2014 which focuses on democratically achieved expansion of social welfare programs \u2014 and any commonly accepted definition of communism. Sanders isn\u2019t pushing for authoritarian rule, government ownership of all private property or an end to capitalism. Instead, he wants \"Medicare for All\" and free access to public colleges and universities.\n\nThis is correct. Biden\u2019s campaign said he misspoke during the South Carolina debate.\n\nBiden meant to say 150,000, the number of firearm homicides. That number checks out with the CDC data.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during a FOX News Channel Town Hall, co-moderated by FNC's chief political anchor Bret Baier of Special Report and The Story anchor Martha MacCallum, in Scranton, Pa., March 5, 2020. (AP/Matt Rourke)\n\nOn his own record\n\nIt is true that apprehensions at the southwest border are down compared with May 2019, as Trump\u2019s re-election campaign pointed out. However, May apprehensions were the highest month in fiscal year 2019.\n\nThere were 132,856 apprehensions in May 2019 compared with 30,068 in February 2020.\n\nApprehensions have generally been decreasing since May (though there were 862 more apprehensions in February than in January). An immigration expert told PolitiFact that at least two factors had likely influenced a decline in border apprehensions: the U.S. implementation of the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, known as Migrant Protection Protocols, and Mexico's increased enforcement actions at its own southern border.\n\nNearly all of the construction at the southwest border has been to replace existing barriers, not to create a wall that wasn\u2019t there before.\n\nThe nearly 2,000-mile southwest border had 654 miles of primary barriers before Trump was elected. Three years into Trump\u2019s presidency, that has increased by 1 mile, to 655.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection told PolitiFact that as of Feb. 28, the Trump administration had worked on:\n\nWhether the administration can complete around 400 more miles in one year is uncertain. CBP awarded a series of construction contracts in 2019 and February, but the agency did not provide expected completion dates for all projects.\n\nTrump\u2019s assurances about maintaining coverage for pre-existing conditions have previously rated Pants on Fire.\n\nAs president, his administration has sought in court to repeal Obamacare without offering any replacement that might maintain its core protections. That includes protections for pre-existing conditions.\n\nThis is a repeated Mostly False claim.\n\nThe short-term, limited-duration plans he\u2019s talking about are not new. They have been around for decades in various forms and are generally considered a stopgap solution for people between jobs or attending school. These plans offer fewer benefits than what\u2019s covered in plans under Obamacare and can bar people with health conditions from enrolling.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to make an apples-to-apples price comparison between the short-term plans and Obamacare plans since they don\u2019t have the same coverage or protections. Health policy experts say that the coverage short-term plans provide is not better than that of Obamacare plans.\n\nTrump continues to falsely take credit for large industrial projects in Louisiana and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Cameron LNG project has three plants that chill down natural gas until it becomes a liquid to be shipped worldwide.\n\nAccording to the company website, in 2014 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued the final environmental impact statement to construct and operate the liquefaction facility. The company got its first federal approval in 2012. In 2016, Washington gave permission to add another two liquefaction lines, although the company hasn\u2019t decided to move ahead on those.\n\nWe previously rated Trump\u2019s story of Kim Jong Un rejecting calls from the Obama administration as False for lack of evidence.\n\nThe public record shows the Obama administration rejected the idea of meetings of any sort until North Korea promised to back off of its nuclear program and accept international inspections.\n\nWhile the administration held out hope of North Korea meeting those preconditions during Obama\u2019s first term, in the second, it took a harder line. There is no evidence that Obama begged for a meeting.\n\nSusan Rice, a former Obama security advisor, tweeted in 2019 that Trump\u2019s statement about Obama trying to call Kim Jong Un was a \"total fabrication.\"\n\nReporting by Jon Greenberg, Julie Appleby and Eric Litke contributed to this story.", "lang": "en"}
