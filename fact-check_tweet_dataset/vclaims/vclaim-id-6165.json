That\u2019s a fall from \u00a3170 billion in 2009/10 to \u00a345 billion in 2016/17 (accounting for inflation). The reduction is well below the Conservatives\u2019 original plan of reaching a surplus by 2015.\n\nWhat is the deficit?\n\nWe\u2019re using the public sector net borrowing measure of the deficit. This is the difference between the government\u2019s income (from things like taxes and investments) and everything it spends on public services, investment, and debt interest. It\u2019s different to the national debt, which is the total amount the government owes to other institutions.\n\nThe deficit can be calculated in cash terms, or as a percentage of GDP, which tells us the size of the deficit in relation to the value of the economy as a whole in that year.\n\nIt\u2019s down, but it\u2019s taking a lot longer than the Conservatives initially planned\n\nSo why does Karen Bradley make a point of this?\n\nCutting the deficit\u2014and achieving a surplus\u2014has been a pledge for this Conservative government and the previous Coalition government. And although it has been cut it since 2010, the Conservatives have not met all of their targets.\n\nThe government set deficit targets in 2010 (which it didn\u2019t meet) and in 2015 (which it abandoned).\n\nIn 2015 the government updated its plans, aiming to have a surplus on public sector net borrowing by 2019/20.\n\nThe government isn\u2019t forecasted to achieve this within the next five years, and new targets were set by the Chancellor last autumn, which are \u201cpresumed\u201d to be for 2024-25.\n\nSo the deficit has been coming down, but not as rapidly as the Coalition and the Conservatives had said in 2010 and 2015.", "lang": "en"}
