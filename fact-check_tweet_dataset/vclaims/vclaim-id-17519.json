In the original photograph, Kumar is not standing behind a portrait of Afzal Guru. A video of the rally, uploaded on Youtube, shows him standing behind the symbol of Communist Party of India.\n\nAs evident from the collage below, the image on the right represents Kumar\u2019s rally, and CPI\u2019s poster on the vehicle was photoshopped with an image of Afzal Guru.\n\nRecently, Kanhaiya Kumar was also targeted using a video shared with a false narrative and a set of images posted in a misleading manner.", "lang": "en"}
