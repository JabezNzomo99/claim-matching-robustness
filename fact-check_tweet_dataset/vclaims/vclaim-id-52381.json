The posts also make claims about a link between a potential vaccine and the rollout of 5G technology. The claims are all false, according to health experts.\n\nThe lengthy claim was published on Facebook here on May 31. It has been shared more than 3,000 times.\n\nThe post contains a photo of a syringe overlaid with Tagalog-language text that states: \"Don\u2019t get vaccinated mate!\"\n\nSimilar posts warning of the purported dangers of vaccines have also been shared on Facebook here, here and here.\n\nThe Facebook post's caption states in part: \u201cCOVID 19 =means Certificate Of Vaccination Identity with 19, 1=A 9=I for AI= Artificial Intelligence / This is not really the name of the virus, but this is an International plan to control and limit the population.\"\n\nThis claim is false; \u201cCOVID-19\u201d stands for \u201ccoronavirus disease 2019\u201d, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced on February 11, 2020.\n\nIt was so named following the \u201cguidelines previously developed with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).\u201d\n\nThis WHO document that outlines the best practices in naming new human infectious diseases states: \u201cIf the pathogen that causes the disease is known, it should be part of the disease name (e.g. coronavirus, influenza virus, salmonella).\u201d\n\nCOVID-19 is a disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The first major outbreak of the disease was in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, before it spread to other parts of the world. As of June 18, COVID-19 has claimed more than 445,000 lives worldwide, according to WHO data.\n\nThe new coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has been named \u201csevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\u201d or \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, owing to its genetic relation to the coronavirus responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak.\n\nThe Facebook post also warns against being injected with a potential COVID-19 vaccine. \"Companies and the media are being bribed right now to do mass vaccination,\" it states. \"There are two components to this future vaccine that are not identified yet and still secret. But the third is ' SQUALENE '.\"\n\nThis claim is misleading; as of June 2020, a vaccine for COVID-19 had not been approved by the WHO. Several scientific teams around the world were racing to create a vaccine, as AFP reported here.\n\nSqualene has also been proven safe to use in vaccines, according to global health experts.\n\nThis WHO information page states: \u201cOver 22 million doses of squalene-containing flu vaccine have been administered. The absence of significant vaccine-related adverse events following this number of\n\n doses suggests that squalene in vaccines has no significant risk.\u201d\n\nSqualene is used in FLUAD, a flu vaccine designed for people 65 years and older and approved in 38 countries, the CDC states in this information page. \u201cSqualene, a naturally occurring substance found\n\n in humans, animals and plants, is highly purified for the vaccine manufacturing process.\u201d\n\nFLUAD\u2019s most common adverse effects \u201cwere mild to moderate and were temporary, and included pain, redness at the injection site, headache, muscle aches, and malaise,\u201d the CDC adds.\n\nThe post also repeats false claims about the purported health risks associated with 5G technology. \u201c5G has been installed in cities across the whole world, to weaken our immune defense,\" it states.\n\nThe claim has been repeatedly debunked by AFP and other fact-check organisations.\n\nRadio wave exposure to 5G has not been shown to have any impact on the immune system or pose any health threats, AFP reported here.", "lang": "en"}
