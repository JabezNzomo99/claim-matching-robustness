The picture was typically displayed along with the claim that President Obama was ignoring the terrorist attack in Brussels while honoring one of the \u201cmost reviled terrorists of the modern age\u201d:\n\nHowever, this photograph was not taken during President Obama\u2019s March 2016 visit to Cuba, nor did it picture the U.S. chief executive with a Che Guevara t-shirt. The original image was taken in 2009 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and featured the President with a t-shirt displaying a math joke about Moses\u2019 parting the waters:\n\n\n\n US President Barack Obama holds a T-shirt given to him as he toured a research laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), an institution that has been developing cutting edge clean energy technology, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on October 23, 2009. Shortly after terrorists set off explosions at an airport and subway station in Brussels, President Obama gave a speech about the subject from Havana, saying (in part): \u201cWe stand in solidarity with them in condemning these outrageous attacks against innocent people. We will do whatever is necessary to support our ally Belgium in bringing to justice those who are responsible,\u201d the president, who is currently abroad on an historic trip to Cuba, said at the beginning of remarks to the Cuban people in Havana. \u201cWe must be together regardless of nationality or race or faith in fighting against the scourge of terrorism,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can and we will defeat those who threaten the safety and security of people all around the world.\u201d While in Cuba, President Obama was photographed at Havana\u2019s Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n, with the Ministry of the Interior building where Guevara once worked and its 5-story steel outline of his face visible in the background:", "lang": "en"}
