While Shavnore\u2019s fans are likely aware that many of his pieces are edited composites, his images occasionally get shared online as if they were genuine photographs. We\u2019ve previously reported on a few of his pieces, such as this image showing a large storm over Penscaola Beach, Florida, and this picture of a hurricane approaching Miami, Florida.\n\nShavnore demonstrates how he creates such images in this video:\n\nTo achieve the effect in the viral image of the Paris storm, Shavnore used a photograph of Paris on a clear day taken by @YuriFineart in March 2015, and he edited in a separate picture of a dangerous storm. We have not been able to identify the source of the latter photograph.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how this storm was incorporated into the original Paris photograph:", "lang": "en"}
