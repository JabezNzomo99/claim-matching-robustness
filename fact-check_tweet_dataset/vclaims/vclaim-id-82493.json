Misinformation was weaponized and disseminated in an aggressive, yet strategic manner in a bid to shape public opinion. After the verdict was declared on May 23, the focus moved towards EVMs and the integrity of the poll process.\n\nThe scourge of misinformation centered around politics, which was in full flow in April, spilled over into May.\n\n1. Fake newspaper clipping claims PM Modi\u2019s family blames him for his father\u2019s death\n\nA clipping that had been floating on social media the last few years resurfaced this election season. It talks about Prime Minister Narendra Modi and alleged incidents from his childhood. \u201c\u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u092d\u093e\u0908 \u092c\u0939\u0928 \u0928\u0930\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u0939\u0940 \u0905\u092a\u0928\u0947 \u092a\u093f\u0924\u093e\u091c\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u092e\u094c\u0924 \u0915\u093e \u091c\u093f\u092e\u094d\u092e\u0947\u0926\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u093e\u0928\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948 (Modi\u2019s brothers and sister blame Narendra Modi for their father\u2019s death),\u201d the clipping is headlined.\n\nIt says that PM Modi\u2019s father, Damodardas Mulchand Modi, used to make ends meet by pickpocketing and stealing coal and iron from the railway station where he worked as a tea seller. He traded the stolen items for gold, which, in turn, were stolen by Narendra Modi when he was a young boy. His father, unable to cope with his son\u2019s actions, suffered a cardiac arrest. The family could not get back the stolen gold despite lodging an FIR and Damodardas Mulchand Modi subsequently died because his family could afford the medical expenses. The story ends by claiming that former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee suppressed the case and the FIR against Narendra Modi in 1996.\n\nThe clipping was shared widely on social media and messaging platforms.\n\nAlt News\u2019 fact-check found that the claims made in this \u2018newspaper clipping\u2019 are ludicrous and fake. Alt News spoke to PM Modi\u2019s family who confirmed that the contents of this write-up are false. Moreover there are spelling errors in this \u2018article\u2019, which betray its fakeness. Alt News\u2019 fact-check can be read here.\n\nThe India Today group misreported Rahul Gandhi\u2019s poll speech at Neemuch in MP on May 14, stating that Gandhi had bungled with the names of the chief ministers of Congress-ruled states. An article published on the website was titled, \u2018Rahul Gandhi mixes up names of CMs of Congress-ruled states, Twitter has field day\u2019. Times Now too reported that the Congress president had committed a gaffe.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that Rahul Gandhi had not bungled the names of the CMs of Congress ruled states, as reported by Times Now and India Today. The basis for this claim was a clipped video. Alt News\u2019s fact-check on this may be read here.\n\n\u0905\u0917\u0930 \u0939\u092e\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0917\u0940\u0930\u0940 \u0924\u094b \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0947 \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0906\u0917 \u0932\u0917\u093e \u0926\u0942\u0902\u0917\u093e \u2013 \u092f\u094b\u0917\u0940 \u0906\u0926\u093f\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0928\u093e\u0925 (If our govt is voted out of power then I will set the whole country on fire -translated)\u201d, reads a statement ascribed to UP CM Yogi Adityanath in a supposed screengrab of a news channel.\n\nLooking at the logo shown in the screengrab, Alt News found that the screengrab of the news channel belongs to a Gujarati News channel called Mantavya News. We found that the alleged screengrab of Mantavya News, which attributes an outrageous statement to the UP CM, is morphed. Alt News\u2019 fact-check may be read here.\n\n4. Old photo of Mamata Banerjee shared with false claim that she is Muslim\n\n\u201cPicture speaks more than a thousand words. Mamta adopted her mother\u2019s religion Islam which is evident from this picture where she greets Basu with an adab. Her masters degree too was in Islamic History. She is anti Hindu and her vitriolic diatribe against the Hindus proves her allegiance to Islam!\u201d,read a caption attached to an image, featuring West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and former West Bengal CM Jyoti Basu. The caption along with the image, suggested that Banerjee\u2019s mother was Muslim, and Banerjee had adopted her mother\u2019s religion and was therefore greeting Basu with an adab.\n\nAlt News found that the claim about Banjerjee\u2019s mother being a Muslim is untrue. Gayatri Devi, the mother of Mamata Banerjee died at the age of 81 on December 17, 2011. Further, Alt News also found that Gayatri Devi, the wife of Promileswar Banerjee and mother of Mamata Banerjee, was cremated, a ritual followed by those who practice Hinduism.\n\n5. False claim of PM Modi spending Rs. 80 lakh per month on make-up\n\n\u201cInformation received through RTI reveals that, on an average, Rs 80 lacs are paid to the beautician each month for make up of our PM,\u201d is a claim which was affixed to a video that went viral on social media. The video shows Prime Minister Narendra Modi preparing for what looks like a photo shoot.\n\nThe claim is false. The clip used to propagate that the Prime Minister spent Rs 80 lakh on beauticians has been picked up from the video showing the making of PM Modi\u2019s wax statue in Madame Tussauds, Singapore.\n\nThe official handle of the Congress party tweeted a link to an article by the pro-party publication National Herald, titled \u2018Did the Modi govt secretly transport 200 tonnes of RBI\u2019s gold to Switzerland in 2014?\u2019 The article had appeared online on May 2.\n\nThe claim is untrue. Alt News perused the annual reports of the central bank for successive years- 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14, and compared it with the annual reports of the RBI from 2014-15 to 2017-18, the latest report. The total gold stock of the Reserve Bank of India has remained consistent throughout, and has in fact increased marginally in 2017-18.\n\nA couple of images, of bearded men destroying a statue, were circulated on social media. \u201cCCTV \u092b\u0941\u091f\u0947\u091c \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0938\u093e\u092b \u0926\u093f\u0916 \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u093e\u0917\u0930 \u091c\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u092e\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f \u0915\u094b \u091f\u0940\u090f\u092e\u0938\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u094b\u0917 \u0924\u094b\u0921\u093c \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902 #\u0918\u091f\u093f\u092f\u093e_\u0930\u093e\u091c\u0928\u0940\u0924\u0940 \u0914\u0930 \u0907\u0932\u094d\u091c\u093e\u092e BJP \u092a\u0930\u2026.pls share this post (It is clearly visible in the CCTV footage, TMC workers are breaking the statue of Vidyasagar. #filthypolitics and blame on BJP. -translated)\u201d, read a message posted along with the images by an individual user on Facebook. It was claimed that these images are the visual evidence of TMC workers who are supposedly seen vandalizing Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar\u2019s statue.\n\nUpon reverse searching the image on Google, Alt News found that the images pertain to an incident when artefacts in Iraq were destroyed by ISIS terrorists. \u201cISIS has again destroyed cultural treasures, this time bulldozing the site of the ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud in northern Iraq, the nation\u2019s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said.\u201d, stated a report published by American news network CNNon March 5, 2015. The Guardian had also published the images in an op-ed related to the incident on February 27, 2015.\n\nMisinformation reigned supreme in poll season, from social media to sections of mainstream media as well. Alt News has compiled a list of the most prominent instances, which may be read here.\n\nThere was no respite from misinformation even after the poll verdict on May 23.\n\n1. BJP MP falsely terms death of 19 year old in Belagavi as murder by cow smugglers\n\n\u201cShivu Uppar, a 19Yr old boy was murdered &hanged in Bagewadi Bus stand in Belagavi. He was hacked to death just for protecting cows from the cow smugglers, that was the only mistake he did. I demand CM to deal this sternly & arrest the culprits.\u201d\n\nThe above message has been tweeted by BJP MP from Karnataka, Shobha Karandlaje, along with disturbing images of a young boy hanging from his neck. The tweet was later deleted. The archived version may be accessed here.\n\nThe claim is false and inflammatory. Shivu Uppar was NOT killed by cow smugglers as claimed by Karandlaje. He had committed suicide. This was confirmed by Karnataka police which cited the post-mortem report.\n\nA write-up attributed to celebrated journalist Mark Tully has been shared widely on social media. Titled \u2018Modi destroying termite ridden old Banyan tree\u2019, the write-up is critical of the Nehru dynasty, calling it a \u201ctermite ridden old Banyan tree which will still try its best to stop any one growing to the extent that it may even turn the soil upside down before falling down\u201d. The write-up cautions against the lingering \u2018old order\u2019 and how it will do anything and everything in its power to preserve the status quo and prevent positive change. The full text may be accessed here.\n\nAlt News discovered that the write-up ascribed to Mark Tully is to be found nowhere in his book \u2018No Full Stops in India\u2019. We then contacted Mark Tully who confirmed that this so called article/passage is fake. \u201cIt is a rehash of an older fake which has been in circulation for years now. I would be enormously grateful for anything you can do to make it known the so called article allegedly by me is a fake\u201d.\n\n\u201cWayanad People Celebrating Rahul Gandhi\u2019s Victory with Pakistani Flags\u201d, posted a user, with a video where people can be seen waving green flags and heard shouting \u2018Rahul Gandhi Zindabad\u2019. The user claimed that Pakistani flags were waved at Rahul Gandhi\u2019s victory procession in Wayanad.\n\nAlt News had earlier debunked a video where it was claimed by netizens that Pakistani flags were waved at Rahul Gandhi\u2019s pre-nomination rally in Wayanad, Kerala. In the video, the green flags waved by the crowd are Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) flags and NOT Pakistani flags. This is a claim which is circulated after almost every election.\n\n4. Old video shared with false, communal angle of Muslims in Jhansi tortured by Hindus\n\nA video of a woman, who is seen wailing with a bloodied mouth, was shared in the Pakistani social media ecosystem. Facebook Page Pakistani Defence Command shared the video with a communally charged message \u2013\u201cEndian Hindus are entering Muslim\u2019s Homes and killing them for no Reason. Here a Muslim sister calling us for help. This is Muslims life in Endia. My dear sister we will take your Revenge. Dear Pakistanio Pls Value your PakArmy who are protecting u from these Hindus since 70yrs.\u201d\n\nThe message suggested that Hindus in India are arbitrarily killing Muslims. It was claimed that this Indian Muslim woman seen in the video is desperately calling out for help. The narration in the background suggested that this incident took place at Barau Sagar in Jhansi district, UP.\n\nThe claim was not only false but provocative. Alt News found that the video is actually from Telangana and NOT Jhansi. It\u2019s a 2018 video related to an incident in which a sub-inspector was caught on camera beating his wife and mother-in-law. \u201cThe incident happened at his residence where the victim had gone to confront him over his alleged illicit relationship with another woman\u201d, stated a Times Now report published on August 31, 2018.\n\n\u201c\u092a\u0941\u0932\u0935\u093e\u092e\u093e \u0939\u092e\u0932\u093e \u092c\u0940\u091c\u0947\u092a\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0938\u094b\u091a\u0940 \u0938\u092e\u091d\u0940 \u0938\u093e\u091c\u093f\u0936 \u0925\u0940 -\u0935\u093f\u0902\u0917 \u0915\u092e\u093e\u0902\u0921\u0930 \u0905\u092d\u093f\u0928\u0902\u0926\u0928 (Pulwama attack was a well-planned conspiracy of the BJP -Wing Commander Abhinandan -translated)\u201d, read a message posted along with a newspaper clipping. The clipping had attributed a quote to IAF pilot Abhinandan Varthaman. It said, \u201c\u092a\u0941\u0932\u0935\u093e\u092e\u093e \u0939\u092e\u0932\u093e \u092c\u0940\u091c\u0947\u092a\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0938\u094b\u091a\u0940 \u0938\u092e\u091d\u0940 \u0938\u093e\u091c\u093f\u0936 \u0925\u0940 \u0914\u0930 \u092a\u093e\u0915\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928 \u092a\u0930 \u0928\u0915\u0932\u0940 \u0939\u092e\u0932\u093e \u0915\u0930\u0935\u093e\u092f\u093e, \u092e\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u091a\u0941\u0928\u093e\u0935 \u091c\u0940\u0924\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u0907\u092e\u0930\u093e\u0928 \u0916\u093e\u0928 \u092e\u0926\u0926 \u0915\u0930 \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0964 \u092c\u093e\u0932\u093e\u0915\u094b\u091f \u092a\u0930 \u092c\u092e\u092c\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0907\u092e\u0930\u093e\u0928 \u0916\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u0940 \u0938\u0939\u092e\u0924\u093f \u0938\u0947 \u0939\u0941\u0908 \u0939\u0948 (Pulwama attack was a well-planned conspiracy of the BJP whereas the attack on Pakistan was a sham. Imran Khan is helping Modi win the elections. Balakot airstrikes were conducted with Imran Khan\u2019s permission -translated)\u201d.\n\nAlt News found that the newspaper cutting, which was circulated on social media, was clipped from a fact-check article published by Dainik Jagran regarding the statement ascribed to Varthaman. The fact-check by Dainik Jagran had arrived at the conclusion that the quote is fake.\n\nMisinformation about EVM, EC and the poll process\n\nAfter the declaration of the poll verdict on May 23, aspersions were cast on the electoral process. In several cases, misinformation was the crutch.\n\nA message viral on social media claimed that multiple BJP candidates had received an identical number of votes, and it was suggested that such a result cannot be achieved without EVMs being rigged. The text of the claim is, \u201c\u092c\u093f\u0928\u093e \u0908\u0935\u0940\u090f\u092e \u0938\u0947\u091f \u0915\u093f\u090f \u0939\u0940 \u0905\u0932\u0917 \u0905\u0932\u0917 \u0938\u0940\u091f \u092a\u0947 \u092d\u093e\u091c\u092a\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u090f\u0915 \u091c\u093f\u0924\u0928\u0947 \u0935\u094b\u091f \u0915\u0948\u0938\u0947 \u092e\u093f\u0932\u0947 ? \u0939\u0930 \u0932\u093f\u0938\u094d\u091f \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092c\u0940\u091c\u0947\u092a\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u090f\u0915 \u0939\u0940 2,11,820 \u0915\u093e \u0905\u0902\u0915 \u092e\u093f\u0932 \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0964 (Without rigging EVMs, how is it possible that BJP candidates got identical votes on multiple seats? In every list, the count corresponding to BJP is identical \u2013 2,11,820)\u201d It was shared on Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp.\n\nThis viral claim about BJP candidates getting identical number of votes on multiple seats is absolutely false. In order to verify this claim, Alt News looked up the 2019 Lok Sabha results on the election commission website and checked the numbers for the corresponding constituencies. Alt News found that each of the BJP candidates in the constituencies listed above have unique number of votes, and not a single match was found.\n\n2. False claim of 6 lakh votes polled in favour of Rahul Gandhi vanishing from EC records\n\nDid over 6 lakh votes polled in favour of Congress president Rahul Gandhi in Wayanad disappear from the records? This was a claim made on social media, on the basis of a screenshot of the website of the Election Commission of India. According to this claim, the EC website had showed over 13 lakh votes in favour of Rahul Gandhi, which became 7 lakh when the final result was declared.\n\nThe figure of over 13 lakh votes polled in favour of Rahul Gandhi is false. This is because the total number of votes polled in the constituency was 10,89,819. There is no discrepancy in the records. The claims floating on social media were the outcome of an error on the website of the ECI, which was later rectified.\n\nSeveral instances came to light, wherein social media users had shared old photographs and/or videos to claim that the Lok Sabha 2019 election was heavily compromised. In one instance, a video of alleged EVM malfunction during the 2017 civic polls in Uttar Pradesh was shared as recent. A video of an incident which took place ahead of the MP assembly election of December 2018 was shared with the implication that this represented the state of affairs in the general election.\n\nThe above photographs, for example, were clicked in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Yet, they were circulated with the false claim that they represented an outpouring of anger against the use of EVMs.", "lang": "en"}
