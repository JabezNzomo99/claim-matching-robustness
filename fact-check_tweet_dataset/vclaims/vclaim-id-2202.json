It declared \u201ca national emergency to deal with the threat posed by the actions and policies of certain persons who had undermined democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threatened the peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ukraine; and contributed to the misappropriation of Ukraine\u2019s assets.\u201d\n\nThen, last December, Obama ordered the seizure of Russian diplomatic property in the United States and the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats in response for Moscow\u2019s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nFollowing on that, the U.S. Congress in July approved a package of sanctions against Russia for meddling in the 2016 vote.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump signed the sanctions into law in early August.\n\nWith each wave of sanctions against Russia, the list of targeted industries, companies and persons has expanded.\n\nOver the five years since the first set of sanctions was imposed, the Kremlin has repeatedly denied that the measures have been effective.\n\nMore recently, however, Russian officials began pushing of the idea that the U.S. imposed sanctions are \u201cillegal\u201d under international law.\n\nDuring a visit in Finland in late July, President Vladimir Putin called the U.S. sanctions against his country \u201cabsolutely unlawful from the point of view of international law.\"\n\nSeveral high-ranking Russian politicians have repeated that narrative, including Andrei Klimov, deputy chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Federation Council, the upper house of Russia\u2019s parliament.\n\n\u201cThese sanctions are illegal in themselves, because the only thing recognized by international law is the sanctions of the UN Security Council,\u201d Klimov told RT last week.\n\nRussia is not alone in objecting to sanctions unilaterally imposed by the United States. Germany\u2019s Minister for Economics and Energy Brigitte Zypries said in late July that the sanctions the U.S. imposed on Russia are \u201cagainst international law, plain and simple.\u201d\n\nDespite that criticism, Germany previously joined with its European Union partners in approving a majority of the U.S. sanctions against Russia. The EU has also imposed its own sanctions on Russia (see \u201cEuropean Union: Restrictive measures (sanctions) in force,\u201d pages 52-54; 100-110.)\n\nThe legal basis for sanctions imposed by the U.S. government can be found in the Code of Laws of the United States of America (U.S. Code Annotated, Title 50. War and National Defense Chapter 35. International Emergency Economic Powers \u00a7 1701. Unusual and extraordinary threat; declaration of national emergency; exercise of Presidential authorities.)\n\nMultilateral sanctions are approved by the United Nations Security Council and are obligatory for all member countries.\n\n\u201cThe Security Council can take action to maintain or restore international peace and security under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. Sanctions measures, under Article 41, encompass a broad range of enforcement options that do not involve the use of armed force,\u201d the UN regulation states.\n\nThe UN Security Council has nine monitoring groups, which work to ensure that fair and clear procedures are in place for the imposition and lifting of sanctions.\n\nRussia and other countries that dispute the legality of unilateral sanctions cite the World Trade Organization\u2019s General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which covers a \u201cwide range of activities\u201d in the international trade following the principles of the trading system, including the right to trade without discrimination.\n\nCountries targeted by unilateral sanctions have frequently cited GATT principles in arguing that the restrictions were discriminatory and illegal, and thus violated international law.\n\nHowever, GATT\u2019s Article XXI, which covers \u201cSecurity Exceptions,\u201d legalizes the right of any nation to impose unilateral sanctions against another country when \u201cessential security interests\u201d are involved.\n\nWhile the text of GATT has been reviewed and amended several times since its creation shortly after World War II, Article XXI has never been amended.", "lang": "en"}
