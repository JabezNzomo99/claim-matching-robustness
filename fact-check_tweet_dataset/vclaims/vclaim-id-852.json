{"title": "EU Referendum Voting Guide: Vote Leave on EU expansion", "subtitle": "The Electoral Commission's EU Referendum Voting Guide has been delivered to households this week. We've checked the claims in the campaigns' arguments.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-852", "url": "https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-referendum-voting-guide-vote-leave-eu-expansion/", "vclaim": "There were six members of the EU when the UK, Denmark, and Ireland joined in 1973, bringing it up to nine. It\u2019s correct that the latest of the 28 members are Romania (2007), Bulgaria (2007) and Croatia (2013).\n\nAlbania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Turkey are all candidate countries \u201con the road to EU membership\u201d.\n\nThere are two more \u201cpotential candidates\u201d, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo.\n\nIt\u2019s a fundamental rule in the European Union that all member countries must be treated equally. \u201cThe Union shall respect the equality of Member States before the Treaties\u201d, in the words of the Treaty on European Union.\n\nSo if these countries are let in they will end up with the same rights as other members.\n\nIt\u2019s likely there would be some transitional arrangements, such as optional restrictions on workers from new countries in the years after they join. This happened when new members joined in 2004, 2007 and 2013.\n\nFor any country to join requires the unanimous agreement of all existing members\u2014both in the EU\u2019s Council, and by signing off on a treaty with the new member.\n\nSo the UK has a veto over any of the candidate countries joining but it is government policy to support the accession of Turkey.", "lang": "en"}
