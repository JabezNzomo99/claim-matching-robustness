Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of Indian Jawans celebrating the Ganesh Chaturthi festival in Galwan valley, Ladakh. Fact: Video in the post shows the Indian soldiers celebrating Ganesh Chaturthi festival at Shingo valley in 2019. It is an old video and has nothing to do with Galwan valley. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn reverse image search, we found the same visuals in a YouTube video posted by a user on \u201817 September 2019\u2019. This video was uploaded in YouTube with the title \u2018Ganesh pooja procession of Indian Army at Shingo River Valley\u2019. We could see a banner with the name \u2018Shingo river valley\u2019 at 0.07 seconds in the video shared in the post. Shingo river valley is located near Kargil and it is nearly 229 kilometres away from the Galwan valley. Posting the same video in YouTube on \u201816 September 2019\u2019, a user described it as \u2018Ganapati Mirvanuk celebrations of Indian army\u2019. So, it can be concluded that video shared in the post is an old one and is not related to any event in Galwan valley, Ladakh.\n\nTo sum it up, an old video of Jawans celebrating Ganesh Chaturthi near Shingo valley is falsely shared as the celebration of Army jawans at Galwan valley in Ladakh.", "lang": "en"}
