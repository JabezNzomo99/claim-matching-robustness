They were caught while storing several EVM machines in strong rooms from an unnumbered school bus and three Bolero jeeps.),\u201d is a claim viral on social media. The accompanying video shows hundreds of EVMs recovered from vehicles.\n\nFrom a Facebook page \u0a15\u0a4c\u0a2e \u0a26\u0a40 \u0a38\u0a3c\u0a3e\u0a28, the video attracted 48,000 views but was later taken down. An archived version of the post can be accessed here.\n\nThe video is widely circulated on social media with the identical claims that PM Modi, Amit Shah and the Election Commission sketched a conspiracy to store electronic voting machines in strong rooms, and these were transported in an unnumbered school bus and two Bolero jeeps.\n\nAlt News found that the video pertained to a November 2018 incident when Congress workers accused the BJP of voter tampering before the MP assembly elections. It was claimed these EVMs reached the polling booth 48 hours after the voting concluded.\n\nThe Chief Electoral Officer of Madhya Pradesh, however, claimed that these were \u2018reserve\u2019 EVMs, stationed at police stations and to be used as a replacement for malfunctioning machines during polling. \u201cSuch machines were to be stored separately from polled EVMs. Strong room having polled EVMs was neither opened nor was supposed to be opened,\u201d read the tweet by CEO MP Elections.\n\nNDTV had reported the incident, presenting claims from both the sides. According to the news report, government officials were not providing clear answers on the issue.\n\nThe video\u2019s current virality misleads social media users that the incident was recent and the alleged tampering was done to rig the coming general elections. The video, however, is from last year\u2019s Madhya Pradesh assembly polls.", "lang": "en"}
