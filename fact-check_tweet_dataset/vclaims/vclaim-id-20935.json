As part of Nyesom Wike\u2019s pitch, he insists that his administration\u2019s investments in security in the southern state are paying off.\n\n\u201cInvestors are coming to Rivers regularly and they are talking about insecurity,\u201d\n\n. \u201cLook at what is happening in Lagos, Kogi, Kaduna and Kano and you will realise that this state is the safest.\u201d\n\nfrom the governor\u2019s aide Simeon Nwakaudu confirmed that Wike said this last month at a dinner marking the 20th anniversary of\n\nBut could Rivers \u2013 a state as notorious for oil-related vigilantism and electoral fraud as it is\n\nfor its natural resources \u2013 actually be safer than the other five?\n\nAfrica Check has repeatedly tried to contact Wike\u2019s office to establish the source of his claim and to clarify exactly what he meant when he said Rivers state was the \u201csafest\u201d.\n\n, though, he specifically mentioned that his administration was committed to the \u201csecurity of lives and property\u201d in Port Harcourt.\n\nBut in its latest advisory published in April 2017, the\n\n, including Rivers and Kaduna, citing security risks such as kidnappings and robberies.\n\n, providing aggregated crime data for each state in the country. Its latest report groups crime reported to the police into four categories:\n\nThe data agency says it had verified the numbers which were provided to it by the\n\nWhat do the numbers say?\n\nThe 2016 data shows a total of 125,790 cases of crime were reported nationally in that year. Over half of these, 65,397, were offences against property while 45,554 offences were committed against persons. Those against lawful authority and local acts were 12,144 and 2,695 respectively.\n\nAs we explain in our\n\nlooking at raw crime numbers without separating the different types of crime categories results in a skewed interpretation of the data. Most importantly, population figures need to be taken into account.\n\nshow that Lagos and Kano each boast populations nearly double that of Rivers state \u2013 so they would reasonably have a higher total number of crimes than much smaller states.\n\nNigeria\u2019s population figures are notoriously patchy. The last census was in 2006 but it\n\n. The national statistics agency used the results of that count for its\n\n. Under this, Kano has an estimated population of 13.1 million, Lagos 12.55 million, Kaduna 8.25 million, Rivers 7.3 million, Benue 5.74 million and Kogi 4.47 million.\n\nWhile this data is not without its problems, it remains the most current available official information.\n\nTo account for differences in population size, when working with crime statistics we typically work out what is called a crime ratio per 100,000 people. This allows us to compare incidence of crime in cities or states with different populations.\n\nUsing the population data and crime statistics data provided, we calculated the crime rates for the two categories \u2013 crimes against persons and against property \u2013 that governor Wike appeared to have been referring to.\n\nWhen the crime data is approached this way, Rivers was second after Lagos for offences against persons. For crimes against property, it had a lower rate than Lagos and Kano, but a higher rate than Kogi, Benue and Kaduna.\n\nLike most countries, Nigeria releases its crime statistics retrospectively \u2013 the information for 2016 was released in mid-2017, meaning it was already at least six months out of date. While this is not an unusual practice, there may be important trends not yet covered by this data.\n\nSo how safe is Rivers for investments?\n\n, a Nigeria-based research firm that focuses on market intelligence and the financial and political economy for commentary.\n\nProshare listed peculiar risks associated with the six states.\n\n\"Kidnapping and militancy in some part of the South-South region has deterred investment. Also, the cycle of religious violence has stalled foreign direct investment and dried up capital importation in some parts of the northern region,\" the firm said in an e-mail to Africa Check.\n\n\"Given our peer comparison, Lagos state appears the safest among the selected states.\"\n\nUkoji Vitus is the assistant coordinator of\n\n. Nigeria Watch draws its information from analysing multiple alternative sources, including the media, human rights organisations and federal security agencies.\n\nVitus says that according to their data \u201cthere has been a consistent increase in crime rate and fatalities in [Rivers] state since January this year. Peculiar to crime in the state is cultism and assassinations.\n\n\u201cHe [Wike] may be right if he thinks or says militancy has reduced in the state. However, there is a [thin] line between cultists and militants in the state as many of the former militants are used by political stakeholders to drive home their political goals.\u201d\n\nConclusion: Evidence does not support claim that Rivers state is safer than 5 others\n\nTo play up his security record to investors, Rivers state governor Nyesom Wike said five other states - Lagos, Kogi, Kaduna, Benue and Kano - were less safe than his.\n\nBy using current crime data and contextualisation from experts there is no evidence that Rivers state is safer than the five others. At best, Rivers is safer than Lagos when it comes to crimes against persons and property and safer than Kano when property crime is considered. However, it is not safer than the smaller states of Kogi, Benue and Kaduna, according to 2016 crime statistics.\n\nWhen other risk factors are taken into account, Rivers\u2019 safety profile further decreases further. We therefore rate the governor\u2019s claim as incorrect.\n\nAt least 3 of the states are safer", "lang": "en"}
