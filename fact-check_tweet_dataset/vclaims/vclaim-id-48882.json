The tweet also does not appear to match the style of information given on the Police Scotland account, whereas the Cumbria Roads Police account frequently tweets about incidents.\n\nThe timestamp shown on one version of the tweet does not match Twitter\u2019s time and date style.\n\nCumbria Roads Police have stated on their Twitter that the tweet attributed to Scottish police is not real. We have reached out to Police Scotland for comment.", "lang": "en"}
