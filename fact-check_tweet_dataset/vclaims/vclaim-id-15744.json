Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Shashi Tharoor had said that he would even hit a Shivling with a chappal, if needed, to oust Modi. Fact: Shashi Tharoor quoted the Shivling statements as said by an unnamed RSS source to a journalist of \u2018The Caravan\u2019. Those were not his personal remarks. Also, those quoted statements are twisted in the post. Hence, the claim is MISLEADING.\n\nOn doing Google Reverse Image search, the picture in the post was found in an article of \u2018Loksatta\u2019. In the article, an ANI tweet with the video of Tharoor\u2019s speech during Bangalore Literature Festival-2018 was embedded. If we go through that video, we can clearly listen Tharoor saying, \u201cThere\u2019s an extraordinarily striking metaphor expressed by an unnamed RSS source to a journalist, that, Modi is like a scorpion sitting on a Shivling, you can\u2019t remove him with your hand & you cannot hit it with a chappal either.\u201d These are not the personal remarks of Shashi Tharoor as claimed in the Instagram post. Also, the quoted statements are twisted in the post.\n\nTo sum it up, Shashi Tharoor didn\u2019t say that he will even hit the Shivling with a chappal, if needed, to oust Modi.", "lang": "en"}
