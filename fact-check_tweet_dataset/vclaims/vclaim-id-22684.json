Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe quote is close to something Sanders said: \"When you\u2019re white, you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be living in a ghetto. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be poor.\"\n\nWe fact-checked the abbreviated quoted in 2016, and Sanders got it wrong \u2014 we rated it False. But we were drawn to a statistic at the bottom of the Facebook post.\n\n\"Fact,\" it says, \"70% of Americans in poverty are white. Stop dividing us. Stop pitting us against each other.\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe reached out to Poverty Solutions, an initiative at the University of Michigan aimed at preventing and alleviating poverty, for insight about the Facebook post statistic.\n\nNatalie Peterson, a data and evaluation associate, pointed us to the most recent official poverty report from the U.S. Census Bureau. Income and Poverty in the United States was released September 2018 and reports on data for 2017.\n\nAccording to the report, nearly 39.7 million people were living in poverty in the United States in 2017. Of that group, 17 million were non-Hispanic whites. That means that non-Hispanic whites accounted for 42% of all people living in poverty.\n\nShe also pointed us to the Supplemental Poverty Measure for 2017. This is a broader measure of poverty in the United States, Peterson said. It includes people living together who aren\u2019t related, including unmarried partners, and it has a wider definition of what qualifies as income, including non-cash public benefits like food stamps and Medicaid.\n\nBy that measure, there were nearly 45 million people living in poverty in the United States in 2017. Of that group, 19 million were non-Hispanic white. That means that non-Hispanic whites accounted for 43% of people living in poverty under the supplemental poverty measure.\n\nNext, we asked Peterson about a 2012 Census Bureau presentation slide we found as we were searching around for evidence that 70% of people in poverty are white. The slide is titled: \"Are most people in poverty white?\" According to the slide, which looks at data from 1960-2011, 31.7 million whites were living in poverty at the end of the time period being studied. That\u2019s compared to 14.5 million non-whites. That would mean that about 69 percent of those living in poverty then were white.\n\nBut Peterson noticed a caveat: \"White,\" in this case, includes Hispanics who identify their race as white. Looking at historical data in the official poverty report, in 2011, 46.2 million people of all races were in poverty. Of that group, 67% of the all people living in poverty were \"white alone.\" But looking at \"white alone, not Hispanic,\" the percentage dropped to 41% living in poverty.\n\nIn 2017, among the 39.7 million people living in poverty, 26.4 million were \"white alone,\" or about 66%, while those who were \"white alone, not Hispanic\" was 42%.\n\nThe Facebook post claims that 70% of Americans in poverty are white. Including people of Hispanic origin, that\u2019s close: In 2017, the most recent year for which data is available, 66% of people living in poverty were white, including people of Hispanic origin.\n\nBut that number drops to 42% \u2014 under the official poverty measure \u2014 when people of Hispanic origin are omitted. This Facebook post, published by a Facebook account called \"Fed Up Deplorables,\" shows people with fair skin in what look like seemingly poor, rural settings.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the quote from Bernie Sanders, which Sanders made in response to a 2016 debate question from CNN\u2019s Don Lemon about \"racial blind spots.\" His answer distinguished white Americans from people of color.\n\nSo, while there are context clues that suggest this post is meant to give the impression that 70% of people who live in poverty are not people of color, a strict reading of the claim leaves enough wiggle room that we can\u2019t discount the fact that demographers sometimes use the word \"white\" to include those who describe themselves as being Hispanic.\n\nBecause it depends on whether \"white\" includes those who are Hispanic or not, we rate the Facebook claim that white people account for 70% of Americans living in poverty Half True.", "lang": "en"}
