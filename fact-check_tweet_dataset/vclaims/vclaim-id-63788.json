Two days before the ceremony, Athar Husain, the spokesperson of the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF) which is responsible for the building of the mosque, told Hindustan Times that the site will not just be used for a mosque but also to build a hospital and a cultural centre.\n\nThe image of the hospital complex along with the signboard was shared on Facebook with the following caption (In both English and Hindi):\n\nThe image also contains two more signs saying \"Dept. Of Cancer\" and \"Dept. Of Corona\". While this initially suggested that the photo may have started off satire, the comments and the captions revealed that people sharing the photo fell for the false caption.\n\nThe same image was also shared with similar claims in Bangla on Facebook.\n\n\n\nWe did a reverse image search of the viral photo, which led us to a website belonging to the Smith Group - an architectural planning firm. The webpage carried the viral image, and described it as the University of Virginia Hospital in Charlottesville, Virginia, United States - which the firm claimed to have designed.\n\nWe noticed that this image, while almost similar to the viral image, did not contain any signboard saying \"Babri Hospital\".\n\n\n\nWe looked at the LinkedIn page of the University of Virginia Health System, and found the same image being used as cover photo. To view the full image, go to their LinkedIn page, right click on the cover page and click on \"View Image\".\n\nThe following image will open up.\n\nThe image did not contain any signboard saying \"Babri Hospital\", nor did it contain the other signs saying \"Dept. of Cancer\" and \"Dept. of Corona\".\n\nWe also reached out to Zufar Ahmed, the Chairman of the Sunni Waqf Board to ascertain whether a blueprint of such a hospital has been released. The article will be updated upon getting a response.", "lang": "en"}
