It claims that a 13-year-old girl Deeba was gang-raped by a Hindu mob in northeast Delhi\u2019s Jafrabad.\n\nAmong those who shared the link is a spokesperson of Telangana-based political party MBT, Amjed Ullah Khan.\n\nBelow is an excerpt from the article:\n\n\u201cThe charged Hindu mob stormed into her residential colony, torching homes and rounding up Muslims. She took an opportunity to escape, Deeba says, members of the mob chased Deeba through out the streets as she was on the run, slogging through alleys in the dark, crying and shouting for help but to her misery, she was finally caught by the Hindus who then took her to an abandon cottage nearby.\u201d\n\nA Google search with key phrases from the article does not lead to any results. This acts as the first clue that the news might be manufactured. A subsequent reverse-image search of the girl\u2019s photograph from the article redirects to random links from 2018. Below is a screenshot of a January 28, 2018, post on Facebook page \u2018We are all GIRL\u2019s \u0986\u09ae\u09b0\u09be \u09b8\u09ac\u09be\u0987 \u09ae\u09c7\u09df\u09c7\u2019.\n\nSpeaking with Alt News, SHO Jafrabad clarified that no such incident has been reported in the area. \u201cThis is fake news. Had such an incident occurred, it would have come to our attention,\u201d he said.\n\nA quick rummage through \u2018Republic of Buzz\u2019 reveals that it is a shoddy website that often promotes misinformation targeting India. Earlier this month, India Today had debunked an article on the website which used pornographic images to manufacture a story about rape by Indian soldiers. The website, in fact, routinely shares such distasteful articles. One of its most popular pieces is \u201877% Hindu women cheat due to small penises of their Hindu partners\u2019.\n\nThe \u2018page transparency\u2019 details of the website\u2019s Facebook page reveals that it is managed by six individuals from Pakistan.\n\nThe original Twitter handle of republicofbuzz.com was suspended and it now functions under @buzzrepublic. A Pakistani user Muhammad Tariq Kahut had welcomed the handle in 2018 and congratulated \u2018@FKahut\u2018 \u2013 an account which is suspended.\n\nThe handle @FKahut belonged to Pakistani user Fahad Kahut who describes himself as a \u2018filmmaker\u2019 and now runs his handle under the username @KahutFahad. Another Twitter conversation between Muhammad Tariq Kahut and Fahad Kahut reveal that they are father-son. Below, Muhammed says \u201cseriously thinking of launching a YouTube channel\u2026told by son @KahutFahad to be ready for this\u2026under the banner of #RepublicOfBuzz\u201d.\n\nA scroll through Kahut\u2019s Facebook page shows that he is associated with \u2018Republic of Buzz\u2019.\n\nThe Facebook page of \u2018Republic of Buzz\u2019 also routinely shares his posts.\n\nSuffice to say, \u2018Republic of Buzz\u2019 was started to run anti-India propaganda. Their YouTube channel is replete with videos that spew hate against India as a country.\n\nThe claim that a 13-year-old Muslim girl was gang-raped by a Hindu mob in Jafrabad was manufactured by a fake news and propaganda website from Pakistan.", "lang": "en"}
