Under past administrations, the border didn\u2019t go down, it went up. But if it went down 1 percent, it was like this was a great thing. Down 78 percent,\" Trump said in New York on July 28. \"And, in fact, the southern border of Mexico, we did them a big favor -- believe me. They get very little traffic in there anymore, because they know they're not going to get through the border to the United States. So that whole group has been incredible, led by General (John) Kelly.\"\n\nTrump congratulated Kelly for doing \"an incredible job\" as secretary of Homeland Security, and at a July 31 Cabinet meeting \u2014 the first for Kelly as Trump's new chief of staff \u2014 reiterated his pride for reductions in illegal immigration.\n\n\"As you know, the border was a tremendous problem, and they\u2019re close to 80 percent stoppage. And even the president of Mexico called me \u2014 they said their southern border, very few people are coming because they know they\u2019re not going to get through our border, which is the ultimate compliment,\" Trump said.\n\nBased on past statements Trump has made, his remarks that \"the border is down 78 percent\" refer to apprehensions of immigrants trying to enter the country illegally. But calculations of different time periods do not show a 78 percent decline.\n\nThe claim that under past administrations apprehensions did not go down is not accurate.\n\nTrump uses different timeframes to make a case that illegal immigration is down. He has looked at year-over-year March border apprehension data to say there\u2019s been a 64 percent decline; compared February 2017 numbers to the election month, November 2016, to say it\u2019s gone down 61 percent; and said there was a 40 percent decline from January, the month he was inaugurated, to February.\n\nWhere does the 78 percent come from? We asked the White House but did not get a response.\n\nFrom June 2016 to June 2017, apprehensions at the southwest border went down 53 percent.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection data also show that from November to June (latest available figures), apprehensions by border patrol agents declined about 66 percent. From January to June, it declined 49 percent. From Trump\u2019s first full month in office, February, to June, it went down 14 percent.\n\nAnd though they remain low, the number of apprehensions actually picked up in May and in June.\n\nAs the Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker noted, Trump\u2019s claim of apprehensions nearing 80 percent is clearer when comparing cherry-picked figures: the highest point in fiscal year 2017 (November) to the lowest point (April). That yields a 76.4 percent decline.\n\n\u2018The border didn\u2019t go down, it went up\u2019\n\nTrump also claimed, \"Under past administrations, the border didn\u2019t go down, it went up. But if it went down 1 percent, it was like this was a great thing.\"\n\nIn fact, apprehensions have gone down under past administrations.\n\nUnauthorized immigration also fell dramatically during the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations, said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center.\n\nAnalyses of monthly and annual apprehension statistics show declines for both Bush and Obama\u2019s administrations.\n\n\"No matter how you look at it, Trump is far from the first U.S. president to preside over big drops in unauthorized immigration,\" Wilson said.\n\nApprehension rates at the southern border have plummeted since the 1980s. In 1986 there were 1.6 million apprehensions \u2013 about 1.2 million more than in 2016.\n\nThe decline hasn\u2019t been as steady, however, as there have been increases and decreases over the years.\n\nDuring the 1980s, there was an annual average of 1 million border patrol apprehensions at the southwest border. During the Obama administration, the average was below 500,000.\n\nFactCheck.org also pointed out that apprehensions declined 75 percent from fiscal years 2000 to 2016.\n\nReferring to border apprehensions, Trump said, \"The border is down 78 percent. Under past administrations, the border didn\u2019t go down, it went up.\"\n\nCalculations of the latest figures available from U.S. Customs and Border Protection do not show a 78 percent decline in apprehensions. The closest number to that would be based on cherry-picked numbers of the highest number of apprehensions in November to the lowest number, in April.\n\nThough there have been fluctuations over the years in the number of apprehensions, they certainly have gone down under past administrations.", "lang": "en"}
