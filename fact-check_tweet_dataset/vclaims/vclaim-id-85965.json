The message was that the Affordable Care Act Web site, which had a troubled launch, was turning a corner.\n\nAt the same time, the administration has backed away from the idea that it suggested it had a \u201ctarget\u201d of 7 million enrollees when the enrollment period for 2014 ends in March. As Schiliro put it, \u201cthat was never our target number.\u201d\n\nIn one possible good sign, the state of Kentucky announced this week that 40 percent of the 116,000 enrollees in Medicaid or qualified health plans in the state are under 35 years old. Officials are looking for at least 30 percent of enrollees to be under 35.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the health-care marketplace is not a single entity, but at least 51 different marketplaces, each with its own risk pool, so it is quite possible some states will do very well while others might end up with an unbalanced mix.\n\n\u201cWe do not have information on who has paid their premiums now,\u201d one official said. \u201cWe will in the future. This is part of the back-end financial management systems that are left to be built. Issuers will be reporting to us on completed enrollments in connection with payments of premium tax and cost-sharing subsidies, but that we don\u2019t yet have that data.\u201d\n\nInsurance industry officials report that they are still receiving duplicate ID numbers for enrollees, as well as experiencing a continuing problem with so-called \u201corphans.\u201d These are people who are recorded by HealthCare.gov as having picked an insurer, but the companies have no record of these persons, meaning they cannot be sent a bill or receive an insurance card.\n\nMoreover, CBO\u2019s original estimate of 7 million assumed that people had paid for their plans. Under CBO\u2019s definition, if a person bought coverage that began Jan. 1 and then never got around to paying, then CBO would not count that person as having been covered at all.\n\nWhether or not the administration originally came up with the 7 million figure, officials certainly embraced it as a target in the months leading up to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. We agree that the mix of young and old enrollees is perhaps the more relevant number, but it\u2019s a bit odd at this point for the administration to minimize the 7 million figure. Everyone knows enrollment got off to a slow start \u2014 and one can safely assume the administration would be bragging if in December it had exceeded the targets in Tavenner\u2019s memo.", "lang": "en"}
