However, no such announcement has been made by the airlines. In fact, there are videos and posts which suggest that the airlines is resuming its operations. You can view the archived version here. In the viral video, text mentioning \u2018Thank you and goodbye\u2019 can be seen with a voice over saying: \u201cBritish Airways has applied to dismiss its entire workforce from 15 June. So before we leave you, we would like to say thank you and goodbye.\u201d Several social media users have shared it on Facebook and Twitter with the same narrative.

The description of the video reads: \u201cBritish Airways has applied to dismiss all of its staff from 15 June 2020. Before we leave you, the staff of British Airways would like to say thank you and goodbye.\u201d We couldn\u2019t find the viral video on any of the official social media handles of the airline in question. Rather, the airlines had tweeted on 30 June about an offer for its passengers that suggested that the airline is fully functional. Plans can change.

In fact, the airlines uploaded a video on 20 June titled \u2018Looking forward to welcoming you back on board\u2019. We also found a BBC article published on 19 June titled: \u2018British Airways ground staff at Gatwick face redundancy\u2019. The article mentioned that the airline had been criticised by MPs \u201cwho branded the airline \u2018a national disgrace\u2019 over the possible redundancies\u201d. The article quoted an airline spokesperson as saying, \u201cWe are acting now to protect as many jobs possible. The airline industry is facing the deepest structural change in its history, as well as facing a severely weakened global economy.\u201d Evidently, a viral video falsely claimed that the British Airways is shutting its operations from 15 June.", "lang": "en"}
