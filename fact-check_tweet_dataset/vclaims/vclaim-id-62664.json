Furthermore, this is not a genuine presentation to the CIA in 2005. This is a hoax video that was likely created for an uncompleted film project from director Ryan Harper called \u201cFunVax.\u201d\n\nThis video has been circulating since 2011 under the assumption that it showed an authentic CIA briefing. Since then, a number of outlets examined and debunked this claim. Metabunk, for instance, noted that the brain scans displayed around the 45-second mark of the video are presented as if they show a \u201creligious brain\u201d and a \u201cnon-religious brain\u201d from \u201ctwo different individuals.\u201d These scans, however, were actually taken from a 2010 study about a 43-year-old woman with a history of methamphetamine abuse. The filmmaker simply took the original scan, added some red and yellow coloring, and then claimed it showed the brain scan of a religious person.\n\nHere\u2019s the doctored brain scan as shown in the video (left), and the original scan taken from the 2010 study in the medical journal Neurology (right):\n\nWe also examined this footage in 2015 and discovered the following: that this video did not \u201cleak\u201d from the Pentagon but rather started spreading to promote the film project, and that the general \u201cGod gene\u201d theory was unproven.

Here is how we know that: Gates\u2019 name wasn\u2019t attached to this video until 2020, when the Microsoft co-founder ended up at the center of several conspiracy theories related to vaccines and the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. Gates\u2019 name is not mentioned in the video, on this alleged documentary\u2019s failed Kickstarter page, or in any of the social media posts we encountered about this video prior to 2020.\n\nA higher quality version of this film (which can be viewed here) makes it a bit more obvious that the person presenting in this video does not resemble Gates. A spokesperson for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation also told Reuters recently that Gates was not featured in this video.\n\nYou can read Snopes\u2019 original report on this video here.", "lang": "en"}
