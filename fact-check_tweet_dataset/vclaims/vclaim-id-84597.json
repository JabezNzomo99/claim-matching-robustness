Yes, they are all followed by the honorable Prime Minister of India, Mr. Narendra Modi. \u201c\u0917\u093e\u0902\u0927\u0940 \u091c\u092f\u0902\u0924\u0940 \u092a\u0930 \u092c\u093e\u092a\u0942 \u0915\u094b \u0936\u0924\u094d-\u0936\u0924\u094d \u0928\u092e\u0928! I bow to beloved Bapu on Gandhi Jayanti. His noble ideals motivate millions across the world,\u201d Even as PM Modi tweeted his homage to Mahatma Gandhi on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, he continues to follow many of those who celebrate the killer of Gandhi.\n\nThe video that is attached to Mr. Modi\u2019s tweet pays a personal tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his Birth Anniversary. Though from Prime Minister downwards, BJP leaders don\u2019t miss to their mandatory Gandhi Jayanti tweet, the situation on the ground among the followers of the RSS ideology is very different. From criticizing Gandhi to praising Godse, you can see it all there.\n\nAlt News researched the tweets of the people Mr. Modi follows to see the sentiment they express towards the father of the nation and his murderer. Here is a small selection:\n\nThere are those deify him and are ardent admirers\n\nYet others find rational reasons to justify the killing of the Mahatma\n\nThe following tweet is by BJP\u2019s National IT Cell head.\n\nYet, the common feature in many being that they see nothing wrong with the killer\n\nAnd others who equate Godse to Ram, Krishna and Obama while equating Gandhiji to Osama, Kans and Ravan\n\nAnd others who wish Godse were still around for more such jobs\n\nAnd those who salute Godse and support the idea of statues in his memory\n\nThe above is only a small extract from a large number of such tweets by people Mr Modi handpicked to follow. Though he follows so many admirers of Nathuram Godse, Mr. Modi himself has never tweeted anything in his praise. At the same time, he has never said anything negative about him either. His views on Godse remain unsaid, never to be expressed openly.", "lang": "en"}
