The claim is misleading; on May 27, 2020, the Japanese government clarified the plan will only apply to Japanese residents making domestic travel, adding the details of the policy are still being finalised.\n\nThe claim was published here in an article by a Malaysian travel site on May 27, 2020.\n\nThe report\u2019s headline reads: \u201cJapan to offer subsidised flights to tourists to revive virus-hit tourism industry.\u201d\n\nThe first few paragraphs read: \u201cUnder a bold tourism plan to lure visitors back to Japan, the government has launched a new campaign that will help offset travel costs for visiting tourists. The head of the Japan Tourism Agency said the $18.2 billion plan hopes to attract foreigners by offering to subsidise half of their travel expenses.\n\n\u201cWhile little detail of the program has been announced, the government says it could be in place as early as July (despite travel bans to Japan still in place).\n\n\u201cThe announcement follows Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe lifting the state of emergency in Tokyo and four other areas where it was still in place.\u201d\n\nThe travel site also published the article on Facebook here on May 27, 2020.\n\nA similar claim was also published by several media outlets worldwide; including here by UK newspaper The Daily Mirror; here by Ireland\u2019s iRadio; and here by Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post.\n\nThe claim was published on Twitter here and here and on Instagram here.\n\nThe Japanese government clarified the subsidies plans after the misinformation circulated worldwide, emphasising that the proposal would only apply to domestic travel.\n\nThe Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism published this statement on May 27, 2020 saying that \u201cincorrect information\u201d had been published by the media about the Japanese government\u2019s proposed \u201cGo To Travel\u201d plan.\n\nPart of the statement translates to English as: \u201cTo speak accurately, the Go To Travel campaign is being considered by the Japanese government to revive domestic travel within Japan by providing Japanese residents support for costs associated with accommodation and travel.\u201d\n\nThe Japanese Tourism Agency also published tweets here and here on May 27, 2020, denying the claims.\n\nThe tweets state: \u201cRegarding reports by some news outlets that \u201cThe Japanese government is considering a campaign to help foreign tourists visiting Japan by offering support for half of their travel expenses\u201d, please note that the Go to Travel Campaign under consideration by the Japanese government is to stimulate domestic travel demand within Japan after the Covid-19 pandemic and only cover a portion of domestic travel expenses.\u201d\n\nAFP found that many of the misleading reports referenced this May 21, 2020 article by Japanese newspaper The Japan Times as their source, but failed to accurately reflect the details in the article.\n\nThe Japan Times report used text from Japanese news agency Kyodo.\n\nThe report states the government announced it would consider a tourism subsidy plan with the aim to \u201cboost domestic tourism\u201d. The report makes no reference to international tourists.\n\nIt states, in part: \u201cThe government is seeking to boost domestic tourism by subsidizing a portion of travel expenses once the coronavirus outbreak is brought under control.\n\n\u201cThe \u00a51.35 trillion ($12.5 billion) program could start in July if novel coronavirus infections subside soon, Hiroshi Tabata, chief of the agency, told a news conference Wednesday.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
