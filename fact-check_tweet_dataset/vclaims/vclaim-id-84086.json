I woke and I saw that life is all service. I served and I saw that service was joy.\u201d\n\nKhan\u2019s tweet drew over 19,000 likes and more than 4,700 retweets at the time of writing.\n\nSubsequently, mainstream media outlets carried reports claiming that Khan made a faux-pas as the quote was not Gibran\u2019s but Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s. India Today,DNA, ABP News, Mid-day, Economic Times, News18, NDTV, ANI, Zee News, Times Now, Hindustan Times andRepublicwere some of the news organisations that called-out Khan.\n\nSeveral Pakistani media outlets \u2013 Pakistan Today, Express Tribune, The News \u2013 also carried similar reports.\n\nAlt News discovered that several websites had attributed the quote to both Gibran (1883 \u2013 1931) and Tagore (1861 \u2013 1941). However, none of these were either credible literary sources nor did they provide details such as the date of publication or where the lines first appeared.\n\nAnother name that often comes up during a Google search of the quote is Ellen Sturgis Hooper, a 19th century American Transcendentalist. But the difference between the attributions to her and the ones made to Tagore and Gibran are specific details like the year of publication and the source of the verse.\n\nThe lines were a part of a poem by Hooper which was published in the 19th-20th-century American Transcendentalist magazine The Dial, according to several literary sources,\n\nHooper was born in 1812 and died in 1848, before the birth of both Tagore (1861) and Gibran (1883).\n\nHere\u2019s how her poem goes:\n\nIn an 1885 journal article, a historical and biographical introduction to The Dial, author George Willis Cooke wrote that Hooper\u2019s poem was published in the first volume (1840) of The Dial. It was later translated into Italian and attributed to the German philosopher Immanuel Kant.\n\nThe poem was published in The Dial sans Hooper\u2019s name. This could be why it was misattributed to Kant.\n\nPer multiple sources, Hooper had contributed 11 anonymous poems to The Dial.\n\nThe journey of an anonymous poem\n\nA poem that was written by American poet Ellen Sturgis Hooper, published anonymously in a magazine in 1840, was misattributed to German philosopher Immanuel Kant. Through the years, different versions of the same poem were ascribed to Lebanese-American writer Kahlil Gibran and Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore. Incidentally, similar verses have also been pushed in the name of Mother Teresa.\n\nSame quote, multiple variations attributed to Tagore\n\nSeveral versions of the quote tweeted by Imran Khan have been ascribed to Tagore. As the lines moved through time, their form kept changing while the essence remained intact.\n\nA psychology book \u2018 : Human Structure and Functions\u2018, published in 1942, carries a version of the quote with just the first two lines. This was the earliest reference published in Tagore\u2019s name that we were able to locate on Google books.\n\nIn a 1986 publication for UCSF volunteers, we found that the words were altered even further. The quote was attributed to the Bengali poet, but instead of \u201clife was joy\u201d, it said, \u201clife was happiness\u201d. Instead of \u201cI served and I saw that service was joy\u201d, it said, \u201cI served and I found that in service happiness is found.\u201d\n\nThere are several such examples where the form of the poem was altered. The quote does not have proper attributions to Tagore, and even Wikipedia lists it under \u2018disputed\u2019. While Imran Khan got the attribution wrong, both Indian and Pakistani media rushed to call him out without any literary backing.", "lang": "en"}
