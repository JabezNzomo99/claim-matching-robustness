Lamar Smith, the chairman of the House science committee, made a host of false and misleading claims about climate change and related issues:\n\u2022 Smith took a quote by climate scientist Stephen Schneider out of context, claiming he advised other researchers in his field to \u201cnever express doubt\u201d about their work to the public.\n\u2022 Smith said climate scientists have predicted \u201cglobal temperatures would increase more than one degree Celsius by 2020,\u201d but observed temperatures have been \u201chalf as high.\u201d Since the late 19th century, the planet has already warmed about 1.1 C, says NASA.\n\u2022 He said research shows the Paris agreement \u201cwould decrease warming only 0.16 degree Celsius by 2100.\u201d But the author of that study said his research was cherry-picked.\n\u2022 He claimed the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has \u201clow confidence\u201d that climate change contributes to extreme weather. The IPCC\u2019s confidence in 2012 varied from medium to low. Newer reports by other organizations have increased confidence.\n\u2022 He said \u201c the historical record disproves\u201d climate scientists who have \u201ctried to link [hurricanes] and climate change.\u201d But there is evidence to suggest there\u2019s a link.\n\u2022 He claimed wildfires are \u201cdecreasing in frequency.\u201d But they\u2019ve increased in total acreage \u2014 the metric scientists use to measure fire behavior.\n\nSmith, who announced his retirement from Congress when his term ends this year, primarily argued in his March 12 op-ed that the House Science, Space and Technology Committee \u2014 unlike \u201cclimate alarmists\u201d \u2014 \u201cfollows the scientific method, which welcomes critiques, avoids exaggerated predictions, and relies on unbiased data.\u201d\n\nYet his op-ed is filled with scientifically inaccurate claims. Let\u2019s take a look at them one by one.\n\nSmith took a quote by Stephen Schneider, a professor at Stanford University who died in 2010, out of context when he claimed the climate scientist \u201chas said, \u2018\u2026we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have.\u2019 \u201d Smith added, \u201cHis message is clear: never express doubt and never accept any critiques.\u201d That was not Schneider\u2019s message.\n\nThe quote comes from an article published in Discover magazine\u2019s 1989 issue. Schneider, who also served as a co-author or lead author on all five IPCC reports, provides the full quote from that article in an editorial he wrote for the American Physical Society\u2019s newspaper in 1996. (We verified this quote\u2019s accuracy with a microfilm version of that issue of Discover.)\n\nSchneider, Oct. 1989, Discover: On the one hand, as scientists we are ethically bound to the scientific method, in effect promising to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but \u2013 which means that we must include all the doubts, the caveats, the ifs, ands, and buts. On the other hand, we are not just scientists but human beings as well. And like most people we\u2019d like to see the world a better place, which in this context translates into our working to reduce the risk of potentially disastrous climatic change. To do that we need to get some broadbased support, to capture the public\u2019s imagination. That, of course, entails getting loads of media coverage. So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have. This \u2018double ethical bind\u2019 we frequently find ourselves in cannot be solved by any formula. Each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest. I hope that means being both.\n\nSmith ignores that Schneider said scientists are \u201cethically bound to the scientific method, in effect promising to tell the truth \u2026 which means that we must include all the doubts, the caveats, the ifs, ands, and buts.\u201d But Schneider went on to say that talking to the media presents a \u201cdouble ethical bind\u201d where scientists need to also \u201cmake simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have.\u201d\n\nSimilar to Smith, others have interpreted Schneider\u2019s quote as advocating being dishonest with the media, but Schneider concludes by saying his \u201chope\u201d is that climate scientists would be both \u201ceffective\u201d and \u201chonest\u201d in the public eye.\n\nIn his 1996 editorial, Schneider says that he was \u201ctelling the Discover interviewer\u201d about his \u201cdisdain for a soundbite-communications process that imposes the double ethical bind on all who venture into the popular media.\u201d With soundbites, \u201cnobody gets enough time in the media either to cover all the caveats in depth, (i.e., \u2018being honest\u2019) or to present all the plausible threats (i.e., \u2018being effective\u2019),\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cTo twist my openly stated and serious objections to the soundbite process into some kind of advocacy of exaggeration is a clear distortion,\u201d he added.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that Schneider welcomed critiques of his work, contrary to what Smith claimed.\n\n\u201c[A]ll good scientists are skeptics and should be challenging every aspect of what we do that has plausible alternative hypotheses,\u201d he wrote in an email to a colleague, according to a biography by the National Academy of Sciences. In that email, Schneider discussed a paper he had published early in his career that supported a theory of global cooling. We\u2019ve written about the theory of global cooling before, explaining how scientists discovered the world was warming, not cooling, after conducting more research.\n\n\u201cI personally published what was wrong (with) my own original 1971 cooling hypothesis a few years later when more data and better models came along and further analysis showed [anthropogenic global warming] as the much more likely,\u201d Schneider wrote in the email. \u201c[F]or me that is a very proud event \u2014 to have discovered with colleagues why our initial assumptions were unlikely and better ones reversed the conclusions \u2014 an early example of scientific skepticism in action in climatology.\u201d\n\nWhen we reached out to Smith\u2019s office for comment by email, a committee spokesperson told us Schneider\u2019s quote was \u201cpresented with appropriate context and conveys the meaning of his words accurately.\u201d\n\nBut Schneider himself has said such characterizations misrepresent his words. And that\u2019s the case in Smith\u2019s op-ed as well.\n\nThe Rise and Fall of Global Temperatures\n\nSmith also made a couple of faulty claims about global temperatures. For one, he claimed that global warming predictions scientists made in the 1970s \u201care so far off\u201d observed temperatures.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t find any support for Smith\u2019s claims, and his office didn\u2019t provide us with any solid support either. The spokesperson said that \u201cclimate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change consistently predict temperatures that are higher than the temperature[s] that are observed by satellites.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson also pointed us to March 2017 congressional testimony by John R. Christy, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Alabama, that questions the validity of IPCC models and humans\u2019 contribution to global warming.\n\nThe IPCC reports only date back to 1990, not the 1970s. More importantly, the IPCC\u2019s fifth assessment report, published in 2013, took a look at previous IPCC report predictions and found that \u201cthe trend in globally averaged surface temperatures falls within the range of the previous IPCC projections.\u201d\n\nRegardless, the globe had already warmed about 1 C between 1901 and 2016, according to a 2017 report by the U.S. Global Change Research Program. NASA provides a similar figure \u2014 about 1.1 C since the late 19th century.\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear why Smith only cites satellite temperature observations. When we asked his office, the spokesperson responded, \u201cThe op-ed noted satellite data to demonstrate that this is one piece of the observational puzzle that demonstrates a discrepancy between the predictive models and the actual observations.\u201d\n\nBut scientists monitor global temperatures by integrating data from a variety of sources, including ocean buoys, ships, land-based stations and satellites. In fact, satellite data only supplement land and ocean based temperature measurements, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says.\n\nData from all of these sources are \u201cprocessed, examined for random and systematic errors, and then finally combined to produce a time series of global average temperature change,\u201d NOAA explains. \u201cThe warming trend \u2026 is apparent in all of the independent methods of calculating global temperature change.\u201d So satellite data, along with land and ocean data, confirm the trend, NOAA says.\n\nSmith made one other faulty claim related to global temperatures. He said research out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \u201cshows that the [Paris] agreement would decrease warming only 0.16 degree Celsius by 2100 \u2013 over 80 years from now \u2013 and only if all 195 countries completely abided by the agreement.\u201d\n\nSmith\u2019s office told us he meant to use the figure 0.2 C. But one of the authors of the MIT report has said that figure is \u201ccherry-picked.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve written about this topic before, when President Donald Trump and Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt made similar claims when the president announced the U.S. would pull out of the Paris Agreement.\n\nAs we explained previously, the 0.2 C estimate doesn\u2019t consider the full potential effect of the Paris Agreement. The MIT report assumed countries participating in the agreement wouldn\u2019t further strengthen their commitments to combat climate change after 2030. But one central goal of the Paris Agreement is for countries to strengthen their commitments over time.\n\nThe Paris Agreement also builds on other commitments made by the countries party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. John Reilly, the MIT researcher, argued in a Washington Post op-ed that it\u2019s the \u201ccumulative effect\u201d of all commitments made under this framework that\u2019s the \u201crelevant number, not 0.2 degrees.\u201d\n\nReilly pointed to one analysis by the climate modeling nonprofit Climate Interactive that found this cumulative effect would be a reduction of 0.9 C by 2100, compared with business as usual.\n\nSmith made a few faulty claims about the link between extreme weather and warming as well, all of which we\u2019ve written about before.\n\nTo start, Smith said, \u201cEven the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has affirmed that they have \u2018low confidence\u2019 in climate change contributing to extreme weather.\u201d That\u2019s not what the IPCC said. Instead, it has different levels of confidence for different extreme weather events.\n\nWe\u2019ve made this point repeatedly in articles, including one that looked at a similar claim Smith made back in 2015.\n\nSmith\u2019s spokesperson pointed us to a 2012 IPCC report, which says, for example, that scientists have \u201cmedium confidence\u201d that human influences have contributed to extreme precipitation globally and an \u201cincrease in length or number\u201d of heat waves in many regions. But the report has \u201clow confidence\u201d that there\u2019s been \u201cincreases in tropical cyclone activity\u201d globally.\n\nThe report clarifies that \u201clow confidence\u201d doesn\u2019t mean there definitively haven\u2019t been changes in a particular extreme event. Rather, it means the data don\u2019t give scientists enough confidence to say one way or the other.\n\nBut the 2012 IPCC report is dated. About a year ago, we wrote about the varying levels of confidence scientists have when linking global warming to various extreme weather events, based on a 2016 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. The report authors have high confidence when linking global warming to an increased likelihood of extreme heat events, for example, but medium confidence when linking it to an increased likelihood of droughts and extreme rainfall.\n\nThis brings us to another claim about extreme weather Smith made in his March 12 op-ed.\n\nSmith said that \u201cthe historical record disproves\u201d climate scientists who have \u201ctried to link [recent hurricanes] and climate change,\u201d adding, \u201cHurricane landfalls in the United States since 1900 are on a steady decline.\u201d\n\nFor support, the spokesperson again referred us to the 2012 IPCC special report. That IPCC report looks at hurricane activity in general, not hurricane landfalls. As already noted, it does say scientists have \u201clow confidence\u201d that there have been \u201cincreases in tropical cyclone activity\u201d globally.\n\nHowever, a 2017 U.S. Global Change Research Program report says scientists have \u201cmedium confidence\u201d that there\u2019s a link between human activity and increased hurricane activity in the North Atlantic Ocean, where hurricanes that make landfall in the U.S. originate.\n\nTo be clear, climate scientists don\u2019t say climate change causes intense hurricanes to occur, but evidence suggests it makes them more likely to occur, an important distinction we\u2019ve made previously.\n\nSo while the link between warming and hurricane activity is not as solid as the link between warming and other extreme weather events, such as heat waves, there is still evidence to suggest warming has an impact.\n\nLastly, Smith claimed in his op-ed: \u201cExamination of patterns of other extreme weather events in the United States shows that a changing climate does not increase the frequency of these events,\u201d adding, \u201cU.S. wildland fires are decreasing in frequency.\u201d But scientists look at the total acreage of fires -\u2013 not the number of fires -\u2013 to evaluate links with global warming. And the total acreage has increased since at least the 1980s.\n\nKari Cobb, a spokesperson for the National Interagency Fire Center, explained to us by email: \u201cIt\u2019s important to look at the acreage burned over the number of fires reported because that is what is indicative of fire behavior.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cacres burned can be tied to environmental factors like climate and availability of fuels,\u201d such as dry leaves, brush or grass. But the number of fires \u201cdoes not provide a correlation to most environmental factors that truly affect fire.\u201d In other words, \u201cAll it provides is how many of fires were reported, not how that fire behaved or moved across the landscape,\u201d she said.\n\nWe also spoke with Cobb for an article we wrote back in October that looked at whether global warming is linked to the increase in the total acreage of wildfires in the West \u2014 an increase that dates back to at least the 1980s. As we pointed out in that piece, researchers say a hot and dry summer \u2014 conditions more likely in a warmer world \u2014 caused widespread wildfires in Western states last year. But land use changes dating back to the 1800s have also played a role.\n\nWhen we asked Cobb in October what role climate change plays in the severity and length of the fire season, she pointed to \u201clonger summers, higher temperatures, decreased precipitation, and longer episodes of drought.\u201d She added, \u201cThe combination of these changes has increased the availability of dry fuels and the ease at which fire ignites and spreads.\u201d\n\nOverall, Smith\u2019s Fox News piece twisted the words, findings and methods of climate scientists, making it what we\u2019d call an error-filled op-ed.", "lang": "en"}
