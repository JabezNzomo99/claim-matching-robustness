Both claim they did not have sex until she was 18.\n\nJoe Morrissey was elected to the Virginia State Senate in November 2019 despite having had a sexual relationship with his teenage receptionist (who is now his wife) and being disbarred.\n\nJoe Morrissey has a long, complicated, and wild history in Virginia law and politics. A former attorney, he has been disbarred twice. He spent time in jail for a courthouse fistfight and for misdemeanor charges related to contributing to the delinquency of a minor \u2014 accusations stemming from a relationship with his then-teenage secretary who is now his wife.\n\nThis history of scandal folded into the fraught politics of 2019, when various elections across the U.S. were viewed as a referendum on the presidency of an embattled Donald Trump, who was facing an impeachment inquiry over accusations that he attempted to extort the Ukrainians by withholding crucial military aid in exchange for dirt on a political rival.\n\nWhen Morrissey won a crucial seat and handed a slim majority to Democrats in Virginia\u2019s Legislature, right-leaning news media jumped on his smorgasbord of scandal and controversy.\n\n\u201cDisbarred Lawyer, Convicted Sex Offender Democrat Joe Morrissey Wins Virginia Senate Seat,\u201d went a headline from Breitbart. \u201cVirginia Democrat Previously Jailed for Sex with a Teenager Wins Election,\u201d wrote the Daily Wire. But in 2016, amid an ultimately unsuccessful run for mayor in Richmond, Morrissey received similar castigation from the liberal news site Huffington Post, which published an article with the headline \u201cEx-Convict Who Slept with His Teenage Employee Is Set to Become Richmond\u2019s Next Mayor.\u201d\n\nMorrissey addressed these types of stories in an email to Snopes on Nov. 13, 2019, stating that the stories being circulated about him don\u2019t bother him:\n\nFirst, I am not a convicted felon and haven\u2019t ever been convicted of any felony charges. I have been found in contempt of court several times for merely fighting too hard for my clients. My law license has been suspended twice, most recently for the relationship with my wife in which I served a (6) month jail sentence for contributing to the delinquency of a minor. My wife and I have been together for (5) years, married for (3), and have (4) beautiful children. My focus is on the 16th Senate District and how I can make Virginia a better place.\n\nThe scandals involving Morrissey may be news to some outside Virginia, but they have been common knowledge for many years both in Virginia and also sometimes internationally. They have earned Morrissey many pages of news coverage over the years.\n\nIn terms of the Breitbart headline, Morrissey never admitted to having a sexual relationship with his wife before she came of age. In 2014, Morrissey entered an Alford plea, which is functionally similar to a no-contest plea. By entering an Alford plea, Morrissey didn\u2019t admit to wrongdoing but acknowledged that prosecutors had evidence that could convict him had he gone to trial. He claimed that lewd texts on his phone were placed there by a hacker, but that defense was disputed in a complaint by the Virginia State Bar, which eventually led to Morrissey\u2019s losing his law license for the second time.\n\nIn 2015 Morrissey made public a picture of himself and the then-19-year-old Myrna Pride, dressed in Civil War-era garb, with their newborn:\n\nThe couple married in 2016 (Morrissey was then 58, Pride 20) and have a family together. They announced their nuptials in a joint 2015 press conference, during which both maintained that they had not engaged in sex until Pride was 18 years old.\n\nA month before Morrissey\u2019s electoral victory in November 2019, the Washington Post reported that he was no longer viewed in Virginia political circles as a political pariah, but instead as a key player who, if elected, could deal on both sides of the Legislature. Morrissey ran unchallenged by a Republican candidate, and although he is a Democrat, he is anti-abortion, and some of his supporters are also supporters of Trump.\n\nWe left a voice message for the Henrico County prosecutor\u2019s office seeking comment but did not hear back in time for publication.", "lang": "en"}
