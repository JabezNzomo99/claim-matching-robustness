Advocates of the legislation say it would be akin to every state honoring driver licenses issued by individual states, but gun-control proponents say it would trample over the rights of states to set their own rules for permitting concealed weapons, such as requiring permits and training and barring certain individuals.\n\nHudson, for his part, objects strongly to this characterization. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete falsehood that H.R. 38 would \u2018invite\u2019 violent criminals, dangerous individuals, and convicted stalkers to carry concealed,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cLiberal elites are either cherry-picking data to fit their agenda or blatantly ignoring existing law which prohibits these categories of people from even possessing firearms. In fact, there is a specific provision in H.R. 38 that excludes any individual who is prohibited by federal law from \u2018possessing, transporting, shipping, or receiving a firearm.\u2019\u201d\n\nAll states have statutes authorizing the carrying of handguns in public places for self-defense, but 38 states have various requirements for permits. Only one state, Vermont, does not issue a carry permit, while 11 other states \u2014 Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Dakota, West Virginia and Wyoming \u2014 make it optional to apply for a permit. (There are some advantages to getting a permit, such as being allowed to carry in some areas that are off-limits to people without permits.)\n\nThe laws can vary among states. Federal law prohibits people with felony convictions from obtaining guns, as well as persons convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors, or by persons subject to a restraining order involving actual or threatened violence against an intimate partner. Federal domestic abuse law can prohibit current or former spouses, co-parents and current and former co-habitants from possessing guns. If a state makes a stalking crime a felony, that would also be prohibited under federal law. But some states have broader definitions of domestic violence disqualifiers, such as boyfriend or girlfriends.\n\nAdvocates of the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act say it is intended to allow people to keep their guns while traveling. Some states have refused to enter into reciprocity agreements with other states or allow nonresidents to apply for a permit. So if you want to drive from West Virginia to Vermont with a loaded concealed weapon, you are out of luck.\n\nAs one reader who had complained about Pelosi\u2019s tweet wrote to The Fact Checker: \u201cAll this does is allow someone like me, who can conceal carry in Virginia, not get thrown in jail for driving through, say Illinois, with a pistol in my car. People like me aren\u2019t who you need to worry about.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that that the large majority of states which don\u2019t issue nonresident permits already have reciprocity agreements to allow carry by visitors with a permit from their home state. A map on reciprocity agreements maintained by the USA Carry website indicates that only ten states \u2014 Hawaii, California, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Illinois and Oregon \u2014 and the District of Columbia do not allow reciprocity with any other states. (Correction: an earlier version of this article left off Oregon and Illinois.)\n\nBut the reality is that most states already allow for reciprocity agreements with other states. Federal law also already prohibits violent criminals, abusers and stalkers from having guns; the issue is that some states already have tougher laws than at the federal level that could be overridden by permits from more lenient states. Still, the differences among most states may loom larger in the gun debate than in reality.\n\nWe wavered between Two and Three Pinocchios but ultimately settled on Three because her last line \u2014 \u201cthe @HouseGOP just voted to do exactly that\u201d \u2014 is so over the top and exaggerated. One can have a respectful political debate, raising the issue of a lower common denominator for concealed-weapons permits, without accusing the other side of voting to let violent criminals and stalkers have guns.", "lang": "en"}
