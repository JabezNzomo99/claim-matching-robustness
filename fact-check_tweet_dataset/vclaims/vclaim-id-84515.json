While one of the videos is from Pakistan, the other video is many months old and was shot in Vadodara, Gujarat. They are being circulated stating these celebrations happened in Delhi, Vadodara and Mira Road in Mumbai.\n\nOne of the prominent right-wing Twitter account that circulated the fake video from Vadodara claiming that Indian Muslims were celebrating Pakistan\u2019s win is Sonam Mahajan (@AsYouNotWish). She has now deleted her misleading tweet.\n\nSonam Mahajan\u2019s account had recently been suspended by Twitter. The suspension was later revoked after a right-wing backlash. Prominent right-wing websites and supporters such as OpIndia, Raveena Tandon, Madhur Bhandarkar had extended support to her. Is Twitter going to ignore her action of circulating a fake video with a hateful message?\n\nThe video has been shared extensively on Facebook as well. A page called Bajrang Dal (unofficial) even edited the video to a misleading text to the video, \u201cIndian Muslims celebrating India\u2019s loss to Pakistan in Delhi\u201c.\n\nThis video initially became viral as Muslim youth celebrating Pakistan\u2019s victory in Vadodara, Gujarat and was circulated immediately after India\u2019s loss.\n\nIn reality, this video has been around on social media for many months and has got nothing to do with Pakistan\u2019s victory over India in Champion\u2019s trophy. This same video was posted on Youtube on March 15, 2017. This original video without a watermark was posted on Instagram account of one Safwaan Khan with the hashtags #miabhai #ki #dairing #raees #safwaankhan. While the stunts carried out in the video cannot be appreciated, this video itself has got nothing to do with Pakistan\u2019s victory. The flag which many alleged on social media as Pakistan\u2019s flag is in reality the Islamic flag. The version of this video that has been available on Youtube since March 2017 can be seen below.\n\nThat the bridge in question is indeed the Akota-Dandiabazar Over Bridge in Vadodara can be seen in another Youtube video of the same bridge. While those who initially made the video viral might have specified the location correctly, but as pointed out earlier, it has got nothing to do with the Champion\u2019s Trophy final. This video was first reported and debunked by SM Hoax Slayer.\n\nThe other video that is being made viral is of a hall full of kids and adults celebrating Pakistan\u2019s victory and is being passed off as a celebration by Indian Muslims. A page called \u201cWe Support Arnab Goswami\u201d has more than 11,000 shares for this video on their page.\n\nThis video has also been posted on Youtube and Facebook multiple times.\n\nHowever, if one closely observes the logo of the TV channel which can be seen in this celebration video, you\u2019ll see that the logo is that of PTV Sports. We have juxtaposed a PTV sports video available on Youtube with the screenshot of the viral video. While the video is grainy, a distinct resemblance can be seen in the logos. PTV\u2019s broadcast is banned in India and hence this video is either of Pakistan or any other country where PTV is broadcasted.\n\nAlso, the logo doesn\u2019t remotely match that of any of the Indian sports channels which is an additional pointer to the fact that this video is not from India.\n\nA YouTube user has uploaded this video with the title, \u201cPakistani Dawoodi Bohra\u2019s Celebration On Pakistan\u2019s Win In Champions Trophy against India !\u201d and it can be seen below.\n\nWhile sports should ideally be watched for the entertainment value and the support of an individual or a group of people for a specific team should not be a reason to deride anyone, India-Pakistan matches are a different cup of tea due to historical reasons. Already, police action has been taken in atleastthreestates where certain individuals from the minority community have been arrested for allegedly celebrating Pakistan\u2019s victory.\n\nThe basic idea behind circulating these fake videos is to exploit these very emotions linked to an Indian-Pakistan cricket match and to propagate the idea that Indian Muslims are Anti-Indian/Pro-Pakistan. This sense of enmity that is created by the circulation of such fake videos is then used to further the ideology of Hindu majoritarianism so as to keep the \u2018Anti-Indians\u2019 at bay.", "lang": "en"}
