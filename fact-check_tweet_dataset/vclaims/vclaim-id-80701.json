O\u2019Connor is running in the primary against Carol Shea Porter, who has previously held the seat.\n\nOf late, both the state Democratic party and O\u2019Connor have accused the other of making false claims.\n\nO\u2019Connor put out a statement claiming a Democratic state senator told others that he -- O\u2019Connor -- planned to place rats into the kitchen of the Puritan Backroom restaurant in Manchester. O\u2019Connor denies the allegation.\n\n\"Furthermore, a simple review of the Backroom\u2019s health code records will reveal that the restaurant already has a long-standing problem with rodent infestations,\" O\u2019Connor, a businessman from Bedford, statement on Monday, April 25, 2016.\n\nIs there any truth to this claim?\n\nO\u2019Connor\u2019s spokesman Logan Barbosa pointed us to the Manchester Department of Health website, which posts city restaurant inspections. Barbosa said the Puritan Backroom has been cited for \"critical item violation #35 (defined as found to have insects or rodents, or areas were identified that would allow the entry of rodents or insects).\"\n\nThere\u2019s a big difference between having rodents, and having areas that would allow their entry. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nUnder city ordinance, restaurants are inspected twice a year. A decade\u2019s worth of inspection records for the Puritan Backroom, a sit-down restaurant that also has an ice-cream window, are available on the .\n\nIn nine of the 18 inspections since 2006, including the four most recent, the restaurant has had \"no critical violations observed,\" records show.\n\nThe restaurant was most recently cited in 2013, but for food temperature issues. Over the last decade, records show the Puritan Backroom has never been cited for evidence of rodents on the premises or for any infestation.\n\nThe restaurant was cited in 2011 and 2007 for an \"outer openings\" violation, which falls under the critical item violation #35. In 2011, inspectors noted the \"facilities outer openings have not been tightly sealed to the outside to prevent the entry of pests.\"\n\nIn 2007, inspectors recommended the restaurant install new weather stripping on the rear door, according to Phil Alexakos, Manchester\u2019s Chief of Environmental Health, who oversees inspections.\n\nNeither situation meant the restaurant had pests, Alexakos said. \"If these gaps aren\u2019t repaired, it could introduce pests,\" he said.\n\nThe city\u2019s public health department hasn\u2019t received any complaints about rodents at the facility, according to Alexakos. Officials have never noted the presence of rodents on site, inspection records show.\n\nRestaurant president Arthur Pappas -- who co-owns the Puritan Backroom with son Democratic Executive Councilor Chris Pappas -- disputes the claim.\n\n\"It is absolutely untrue,\" Arthur Pappas said. \"Anybody who has been in my kitchen knows there has never been a problem.\"\n\nO\u2019Connor said the Puritan Backroom restaurant has a \"long-standing problem with rodent infestations.\"\n\nInspection records from the last decade show officials have never noted rodents inside the restaurant. While more than five years ago inspectors noted gaps where pests could potentially enter the restaurant, none have been documented inside over the last ten years. That's a far cry from a long-standing infestation.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
