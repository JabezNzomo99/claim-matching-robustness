Let\u2019s analyze the authenticity of that claim. \n\n\n\nA Facebook post with the same claim and carrying an image of a Bhagavad Gita with the Arabic text was also shared earlier. \n\n\n\nClaim: Saudi Arabian government has released the Bhagavad Gita in the Arabic language. Fact: Saudi Arabian government hasn\u2019t released the Bhagavad Gita in the Arabic language. Information from no credible source was found to authenticate the claim. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched on Google with keywords \u2018Saudi government released Bhagavad Gita Arabic version\u2019, no relevant information was obtained in the search results. If the Saudi Arabian government had released an Arabic version of the Bhagavad Gita, it would have been reported by all the major newspapers and channels in India. But no news agency has reported anything about Saudi Arabian government releasing the Arabic version of the Bhagavad Gita in their country. So, the claim made in the post is false.\n\nDuring the search process, the image of the Bhagavad Gita with the Arabic text was found to be the one translated by an ISKCON devotee H.G. Ravanari Prabhu.\n\nTo summarize, the Saudi Arabian government hasn\u2019t released the Bhagavad Gita in the Arabic language. \n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
