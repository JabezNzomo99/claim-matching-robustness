The screen grab appears to show the bill being titled \u201cAppropriates Funds for COVID-19 Coronavirus Response\u201d on June 13 and 20, 2019.\n\nBut Michigan\u2019s House Bill 4729 didn\u2019t have any language related to the coronavirus in 2019, the bill\u2019s text from that time shows. The bill was introduced by Republican Michigan State Rep. Shane Hernandez on June 13, 2019, passed by the House on June 20, 2019, but never made it to vote in Michigan\u2019s Senate.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the Senate took up the bill in March of this year that language related to the coronavirus was added. At that time, the Senate substituted the bill for one that allocates $125 million for the state\u2019s coronavirus response, including $50 million to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and $35 million to a designated coronavirus response fund.\n\nThat version passed the Senate on March 17, and the House then concurred with the Senate substitute the same day, according to the Michigan Legislature website. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed it into law on March 30.\n\nThe claim appears to have stemmed from titles that were briefly displayed on the bill\u2019s Vote Smart page for actions taken in June 2019.
