While he didn\u2019t announce a presidential pardon at the rally, he indicated he was ready to offer it. \u201cSo, was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job?\u201d he asked the crowd to applause.\n\nFor many years, Trump and Arpaio shared a pet issue: the \u201cbirther\u201d theory. Trump was a vocal proponent of it, until he abandoned it during the 2016 presidential campaign and then falsely blamed Hillary Clinton for starting the conspiracy. Arpaio and his volunteer \u201ccold-case posse\u201d perpetuated the conspiracy for six years until Arpaio was voted out of office in 2016.\n\nArpaio, who became sheriff in 1993, quickly became known for his unorthodox practices, such as requiring inmates to wear pink underwear, work on chain gangs and live in an outdoors \u201cTent City\u201d jail even during the scorching Phoenix summers. In the early 2000s, Arpaio shifted to take on illegal immigration, which raised his national profile.\n\nBut the new effort came at a cost. Arpaio\u2019s deputies started arresting hundreds of illegal immigrants, after entering into a partnership with the Department of Homeland Security. The sheriff\u2019s office blew through its budget on immigration efforts while violent crimes, including sex crimes, went uninvestigated. The office eventually reopened more than 400 sex crimes investigations from 2005 to 2008 \u2014 during which the agency built up its human-smuggling unit while its special-victims unit went disproportionately understaffed.\n\nBut Arpaio resisted. He was charged with, then convicted of, criminal contempt of court for intentionally violating Snow\u2019s order. Arpaio\u2019s attorneys now are asking U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton for a new trial or to reconsider her verdict, arguing Arpaio was wrongfully denied a jury trial. Typically, a jury trial is not required when the defendant\u2019s maximum sentence is six months in jail \u2014 which Arpaio faces at his October sentencing.\n\nArpaio has said he would accept Trump\u2019s pardon. Jack Wilenchik, Arpaio\u2019s attorney, said a presidential pardon is \u201ca check on the system, and the right thing to do \u2026 Because the former president caused this problem [by revoking the Sheriff\u2019s authority to enforce federal law], it is only fair that the current president fix it, with a pardon. And when the judge refused to allow a jury, she refused to let ordinary Americans speak. So now they have to speak, through their president.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you pardon that kind of conduct, if you forgive that behavior, you are acknowledging that racist conduct in law enforcement is worth the kind of mercy that underlies a pardon \u2014 and it\u2019s not,\u201d said Paul Charlton, former U.S. attorney in Arizona under the Bush administration. \u201cAnd it\u2019s an abuse of the president\u2019s discretion. It\u2019s an injustice, and speaks volumes about the president\u2019s disregard for civil rights if this pardon takes place.\u201d\n\nData for metro areas are limited, but you can see this trend in state-level data for Arizona. (Maricopa County, which encompasses the Phoenix metro area, has the majority of the state\u2019s seven million residents.) Even as Arpaio\u2019s immigration efforts ramped up in the early 2000s, Arizona\u2019s undocumented population increased, as did the nation\u2019s.\n\nWhether you view Arpaio\u2019s policies as a success is based on your view on illegal immigration, and how far an elected law enforcement official will push legal boundaries for the issues they value. But as we\u2019ve chronicled, Arpaio has had a decade-long history of legal woes stemming from his policing policies on illegal immigration, and a federal judge found his sheriff\u2019s office had engaged in systemic racial profiling of Latinos.\n\nAfter all, Arpaio\u2019s agency employed systemic racism in the name of immigration enforcement, targeting Latino drivers and detaining them solely based on a suspicion that the driver may be in the United States illegally. He willfully rejected the order to stop these tactics, and is now convicted of criminal contempt. He was voted out of office, but left behind a controversial legacy at the cost of county taxpayers, who are now left with a legal bill of dozens of millions of dollars. We won\u2019t rate Trump\u2019s claims because they are vaguely worded and based in opinion, but they certainly should not be taken at face value.", "lang": "en"}
