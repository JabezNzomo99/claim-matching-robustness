Gov. Casey Cagle has pitched his candidacy for Georgia governor as a promise to maintain Georgia\u2019s reputation as one of the most business-friendly states in the country.\n\n\"Keep Georgia the No. 1 state to do business,\" the Republican's campaign website says.\n\n\"There is no doubt. When you look today, for four years in a row we are the No. 1 state to do business in, and there is room to grow,\" Cagle told small-business owners in Thomasville, Ga., June 22, according to WALB news.\n\nIn saying Georgia is the No. 1 state to do business, Cagle was citing a list put together by Site Selection, a magazine that specializes in business relocation and expansion, campaign spokesman Joseph Hendricks told us.\n\nSite Selection said Georgia had the best business climate in the country for the fourth year in a row.\n\nAs evidence of Georgia\u2019s success, the Site Selection article pointed to growth in foreign direct investment and the film, health and auto industries. It also listed several major corporations that have recently decided to expand in Georgia: athletic shoes manufacturer Adidas, health benefits company Anthem, diversified technology company Honeywell, and tire manufacturer Sentury Tire.\n\nSite Selection is the \"go-to magazine for site selection professionals,\" said Jeff Humphreys, director of the Simon S. Selig Center for Economic Growth at the University of Georgia Terry College of Business.\n\nCagle is far from the only Georgia official to reference the Site Selection ranking. It's been touted by the Georgia Department of Economic Development, Gov. Nathan Deal and the Georgia Chamber of Commerce.\n\nSite Selection is a credible source, experts told us \u2014 but they added it\u2019s not the only one.\n\nAmong the better-known and respected rankings, CNBC places Georgia second, while Forbes places it seventh. Those aren\u2019t first-place rankings, but they\u2019re still pretty high.\n\nOther credible rankings, though, have Georgia lower. The Beacon Hill Institute for Public Policy Research, for instance, placed Georgia 24th.\n\nIndeed, when researchers at Ball State University created a composite score for each state using a number of these best-state-for-business rankings, their measure placed Georgia No. 15 in 2016. That\u2019s basically in the top one-third of states.\n\n\"The problem with rankings always lies in the factors they include,\" said John E. Gnuschke, director of the Sparks Bureau of Business and Economic Research at the University of Memphis. \"No standard scale exists for saying that one state is better.\"\n\nThe Site Selection methodology gives half its weight to a survey of corporate site selectors, and the other half to an index of seven metrics, including facility locations and expansions, total projects, and tax burdens.\n\n\"This topic is an enormous can of methodological worms,\" said Lee McPheters, an economist at the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University.\n\nAs researchers at Arizona State University noted in a 2014 report, the list of factors important in siting a headquarters or research and development facility \"can be quite different from the most important factors in locating a manufacturing plant or some other type of facility.\"\n\nIn addition, experts said, the question of how much weight to give to low business taxes and regulation ultimately owes something to a value judgment about what\u2019s important.\n\nMichael Leeds, who chairs the economics department at Temple University, cautioned that \"the best place \u2018to do business\u2019 is not always the best place to work.\"\n\nCagle, talking about his state of Georgia, said, \"for four years in a row, we are the No. 1 state to do business in.\"\n\nA well-regarded business magazine, Site Selection, has listed Georgia as its best state for business for the past four years. But that\u2019s just one publication\u2019s ranking; others offered different ratings, and it\u2019s impossible to say that one methodology is the perfect one.\n\nCagle's statement is partially accurate.
