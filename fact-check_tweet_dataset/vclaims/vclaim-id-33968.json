No, that's not true: there is no evidence that Californians won't fly the American flag for the remainder of Trump's presidency, regardless of the outcome of the impeachment proceedings. This claim originated as a work of satire but was stolen by other websites without the satire labeling.\n\nThe claim originated from an article (archived here) where it was published earlier this year by BeBest.website under the title \"Socialist California Refuses to Fly US Flag 'Until Trump is Gone'\". It opened:\n\nIn a movement spearheaded by Governor Gavin Newsom, Californians are vowing to take down their Stars and Stripes and never fly them again for as long as President Trump remains in the White House, angering the President and millions of patriotic American citizens across the country. Last month, the flags in front of the Governor's Mansion and the State Senate were lowered and cast aside like trash. Governor Newsom made this pledge to mark the occasion: 'Donald Trump - I refuse to call him 'President' - is not a representative of this great nation. He is a traitor, beholden not to the people of America, but to the leaders of Russia and Saudi Arabia. His sole purpose in running for POTUS was to undermine our own republic and to strengthen those despotic regimes. And so we will not honor the nation that elected him, nor will we honor its flag. Until such time as he is removed, either by election loss or the more just imprisonment, the State of California will symbolically reject his presidency by trashing the US flag.'\n\nUsers on social media only saw this thumbnail and text:\n\nNone of the articles' quotes can be traced back to the speakers. There is also no recent evidence to show that Californians trashed American flags as widespread protest, or that American flags at the governor's mansion and senate building were taken down.\n\nThe article also claims that President Trump threatened to cut off federal funding to California because of the flag protests. Trump did say he would end funding to the state, though not because of any flag desecration. Rather, it was in response to Newsom's handling of forestry and water management, which Trump ridiculed and blamed for the ravages of wildfires. When Newsom requested federal funds to help with California's wildfires, Trump barked back on social media, telling the governor to get his \"act together\" and stop consulting environmentalists.\n\nThe site comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including wearethellod.com, bustatroll.org or bebest.website. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up.\n\nBlair and his operation were profiled by the Washington Post on November 17, 2018 by Eli Saslow:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes bebest.website as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
