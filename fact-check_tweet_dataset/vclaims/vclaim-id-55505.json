Spain has attempted to blackmail Britain with this whole Gibraltar rubbish, wanting money from us to cover their debts, while Greece has stated they will collapse when we walk. It\u2019s not about unity, or how great we are; it\u2019s about money.\u201d\n\nViral posts on Facebook make claims about how much a number EU countries \u201cowe\u201d. They have been shared over 20,000 times. The numbers given for how much each country owes seem to relate to the size of government debt in those countries\u2014they are a mixture of accurate and inaccurate.\n\nThe posts also says that if the UK leaves the EU, France and Germany\u2019s economies will collapse \u201cunder the pressure\u201d, and that Greece has also warned it will \u201ccollapse\u201d. There is no evidence for this.\n\nThe post overstates the size of Ireland\u2019s debt, which it claims to be \u201c865 billion\u201d. The latest data from the first three months of 2019 shows Ireland\u2019s gross national debt was \u20ac215 billion.\n\nThe post understates the size of Italy\u2019s debt, which it claims to be \u201c1 trillion\u201d. Italy\u2019s national debt is worth \u20ac2.4 trillion.\n\nThe post was roughly accurate in its reporting of the other two figures\u2014Greece\u2019s debt is worth \u20ac337 billion, and Spain\u2019s is worth \u20ac1.2 trillion.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that these countries are not alone in having debts\u2014as we\u2019ve written before, not necessarily a bad thing that a government has debt, and almost all countries do. The UK\u2019s national debt is worth \u20ac2.1 trillion.\n\nIt\u2019s also helpful to understand the size of a country\u2019s debt in relation to the overall size of its economy. (A debt of \u20ac2 trillion is easier for an economy the size of the UK\u2019s to sustain, than it would be for an economy the size of Luxembourg\u2019s).\n\nThe UK\u2019s debt is worth around 85% of its total GDP. That level is higher than Ireland\u2019s (66%), but lower than in Spain (99%), Italy (134%) and Greece (182%).\n\nThe UK is not propping up the EU\u2019s debt\n\nThe post claims that when the UK leaves the EU, France and Germany\u2019s economies will collapse \u201cunder the pressure\u201d.\n\nFrom the context of the post, this seems to be referring to the fact that with the UK no longer paying into the EU budget, France and Germany will have to shoulder more of the cost. It\u2019s correct that the UK has made one of the largest contributions to the EU budget in recent years, along with Germany, France, and Italy. (The exact ranking order depends on which years you look at and whether you count money going from the EU to private organisations within the UK.)\n\nHowever, the EU is preparing a budget for 2021-2027 that doesn\u2019t include the UK. The EU acknowledges that Brexit will leave a \u201csizeable gap\u201d in the budget, but says this will be managed through increased contributions and decreased spending in some areas. We\u2019ve seen no indication that France or Germany think they will be unable to manage the new budget payments.\n\nThe post goes on to say that Spain wants UK money to cover their debts, and that Greece has stated they will collapse when the UK leaves the EU.\n\nThis latter claim is likely based on press reports from 2018 that claimed Greece had warned that a no deal Brexit would trigger (in the words of the Express) \u201cEU economic meltdown\u201d. This is extremely overstated: it\u2019s actually based on a paper by a researcher at the Greek Ministry of Rural Development & Food that is specifically about what would happen to the EU budget if the UK left in March 2019 (which was the expected leaving date at the time)and refused to pay the \u201cdivorce bill\u201d.\n\nIt says that says one possible approach the EU might take to covering this budget shortfall \u201ccould result in increased financial and political instability\u201d in Greece, and it advocates for a different approach. Nowhere does it say that Brexit will cause Greece to collapse.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture, Brexit would not suddenly make the debts of other EU countries unsustainable.\n\nThe EU\u2019s budget is not directly used for managing the debt of member states, and it\u2019s implausible to suggest that any change in the amounts Spain or Greece receive from the EU post-Brexit would be large enough to significantly affect their debt. The sums they currently receive from the EU budget are a fraction of their total national debt.\n\nFor example, Greece received just under \u20ac3.4 billion from the EU budget in 2018 (once you factor in the amount it paid into the budget)\u2014around 1% of the total value of its debt. Spain received just under \u20ac2 billion\u2014around 0.2% of the total value of its debt.\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly how much these countries will receive from the EU budget after the UK leaves the EU, but the next EU budget will be broadly similar in size to the current one. That means any change to a given country\u2019s income is likely to be relatively small.\n\nA no deal Brexit would of course likely have larger economic effects than just the change in EU budget contributions, which could negatively impact the economies of EU countries and the UK.", "lang": "en"}
