Chris Christie, said Fox News host Greta Van Susteren on ABC\u2019s This Week.\n\nChristie had a great week of election-night wins as head of the Republican Governors Association, but she said that won\u2019t matter as much when the 2016 conversation picks up and voters \"actually dig in and look at the numbers\" of how governors managed their states.\n\n\"Two years from now, though, we\u2019re going to be looking at the economy in New Jersey,\" Van Susteren said. \"And so far they\u2019ve had seven credit downgrades since the time he\u2019s been governor. That doesn\u2019t look good.\"\n\nSure, credit downgrades sound like a bummer, but what do they actually say about a governor\u2019s performance as state CEO? Did Christie really have that many?\n\nA state\u2019s credit rating is an expert, independent analysis of a state\u2019s ability to meet its debt obligations, not unlike a regular person\u2019s credit score. Here, we\u2019re specifically looking at a state\u2019s general obligation bond rating. Its full faith and credit has been pledged to repay the debt, said Lisa Washburn, managing director of Municipal Market Advisors, an independent research firm.\n\nGenerally, the better the rating, the lower the borrowing cost.\n\nOther types of state-backed bonds, such as transportation trust fund bonds and others secured by an appropriation commitment by the Legislature, are weaker because their repayment depends on legislative action. Appropriation ratings are usually rated below general obligation bonds due to the risk that money is not appropriated.\n\nThe rating for New Jersey\u2019s general obligation bonds has been docked eight times, not seven, we found, by the three major ratings agencies of Wall Street: Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services and Fitch Ratings.\n\nThe following chart details the instances in which a major credit rating agency has lowered New Jersey\u2019s general obligation debt.\n\nAn important note lost in Van Susteren\u2019s claim. New Jersey\u2019s credit rating hasn\u2019t dropped eight notches. Instead, it\u2019s been adjusted downward a total of eight times by the three major ratings agencies.\n\n\"It\u2019s not wrong, but it also makes it sound like the state\u2019s credit rating itself was downgraded by itself by seven places,\" Washburn said.\n\nThe agencies\u2019 ratings tend to be similar, so it\u2019s not surprising that over three years, Standard & Poor\u2019s and Fitch have both decreased the credit rating from AA, the third-highest level, gradually to A, the sixth-highest rating. The Moody\u2019s system is slightly different but tracks similarly.\n\nNow let\u2019s get into why the credit rating dropped.\n\nAs the chart shows, the first drop came in February 2011, the start of Christie\u2019s second year in office. In announcing the first credit-rating downgrade of Christie\u2019s governorship, mentioned long-running problems with the state\u2019s pension and health care obligations, as well as a slow economic recovery.\n\nChristie called the public employee pension and health care system a ticking time bomb and engineered a bipartisan pension law in 2010 that called for shoring up the state\u2019s unfunded pension liability, recently\n\nThe full pension contributions haven\u2019t happened, and the economy remains sluggish, so the outlooks have been generally negative. Ratings services emphasize ongoing concerns about the state\u2019s \"structural imbalance.\" Translation: As long as the state continues to rely on one-time, short-term fixes and only partially funds its pension obligations, the budget outlook and ratings won\u2019t be getting any better.\n\nIn its , Fitch outlined how the state lacked a long-term plan to close its budget gaps in the 2014 and 2015 fiscal years amid lingering low revenues, and the \"repudiation\" of promised pension contributions set in the 2011 law that Christie did not fulfill. Christie temporary tax increases on millionaires and businesses set by Democratic legislators in effort to pay for the pension contribution.\n\n\"New Jersey\u2019s economic performance continues to lag that of the nation, and a multitude of long-term spending demands are expected to prolong the achievement of sound financial operations,\" the Fitch report said.\n\nJust days later on , Christie earned an unenviable distinction among Garden State governors with another downgrade from S&P: He has overseen the most downgrades of any governor, at eight.\n\nWe did not hear back from Christie\u2019s staff in time for our fact-check. In a September story about the latest S&P downgrade, a spokesman for the state Department of Treasury told that it did not come as a shock \"given the tendency of rating agencies to follow one another closely in all actions -- as they did leading up to the financial crisis of the late 2000s.\" Christie himself said the ratings agencies were \" because they were such bums back in \u201908 and \u201909 and they left everybody hanging out to dry.\"\n\nIn fact, an Christie months earlier that another downgrade was likely to come if revenue remained stagnant and the state kept \"deferring pressures into future budgets.\"\n\nThe frequent downgrades do not mean the state is falling to financial pieces. Yes, the state\u2019s credit rating is the second-worst among states in the nation, behind only Illinois. But states generally have solid credit, and New Jersey\u2019s is rated higher than most corporations and is nowhere near the junk-bond status of Detroit or Puerto Rico, Washburn said.\n\n\"An A rating isn\u2019t a bad rating,\" Washburn said. \"It\u2019s still solidly within the investment grade. It\u2019s just well below its peers.\"\n\nVan Susteren said New Jersey has had \"seven credit downgrades\" since Chris Christie became governor in 2010.\n\nWe counted eight instances in which the three major credit rating agencies of Wall Street lowered the state\u2019s general obligation bond rating. It\u2019s important to note that does not mean the state\u2019s credit rating has dropped eight places.\n\nNot all of the downgrades can be blamed squarely on Christie, as he inherited a large pension obligation that only grew. But the downgrades are a well-documented vulnerability in a potential presidential run, and several analysts have criticized Christie\u2019s more recent budget moves for perpetuating an unstable budget climate.\n\nVan Susteren\u2019s claim is close but slightly misses the mark. We rate her claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
