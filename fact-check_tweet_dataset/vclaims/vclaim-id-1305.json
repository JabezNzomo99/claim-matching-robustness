In 2014/15, there were 1,635,000. That\u2019s 28,000 less than in 2013/14 when there were 1,663,000 available.\n\nThat's not the whole story. Councils nowadays own a much smaller proportion of the country's social rented housing stock compared to what they once did. Housing associations are the biggest provider of houses for social rent. So to understand the complete picture these need to be considered too.\n\nIn 2014/15 there were about 2,159,000 units available from housing associations at \u2018target rents\u2019 which, according to the Homes and Communities Agency, are roughly equivalent to social rent. The following year there were 2,123,000, a decrease of nearly 37,000.\n\nThis follows the trend of the last five years, where there has generally been a decrease in the number of housing association properties available at target rents.\n\nIncluding \u201caffordable\u201d rents, as the government does in its definition of social housing, the stock of social and affordable rented homes continues to increase. Affordable rents are up to 80% of market levels, while social rents are around 50%.\n\nWe removed \u201calthough more social housing generally is being built than is being sold\u201d from the conclusion and replaced it with a more detailed picture of what\u2019s been happening to levels of \u201csocial rented\u201d and \u201caffordable rented\u201d housing. We also updated the piece to include these breakdowns in the text, and to use a better measure of the total stock of social housing.", "lang": "en"}
