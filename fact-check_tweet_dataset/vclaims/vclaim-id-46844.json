Qasem Soleimani \u201c[a]ssisted in the clandestine travel to Afghanistan\u201d of some of the terrorists who executed the 9/11 terrorist attacks. To support his claim, a spokeswoman referred to a State Department document that said Iran, not Soleimani, permitted members of al Qaeda, including some of the 9/11 hijackers, to travel through Iran to Afghanistan, where some received training.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean that Iran, or Soleimani, knowingly aided al Qaeda in carrying out the attacks, which may be the impression some got from Pence\u2019s tweet.\n\nNotably, the 9/11 Commission Report \u2014 which doesn\u2019t mention Soleimani at all \u2014 said that investigators found no evidence that Iran was involved with, or had prior knowledge of, the terrorist organization\u2019s plans to attack the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nPence made his claim in a series of tweets on Jan. 3, in which he defended President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to have Soleimani, the head of Iran\u2019s Quds Force, killed in a U.S. drone attack in Baghdad on Jan. 2. In a statement about his death, the Department of Defense said Soleimani and the Quds Force \u201cwere responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members,\u201d and \u201cwas actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.\u201d\n\nIn his Twitter thread, Pence listed \u201csome of\u201d what he called Soleimani\u2019s \u201cworst atrocities,\u201d and wrote that the now-deceased Iranian military leader \u201c[a]ssisted in the clandestine travel to Afghanistan of 10 of the 12 terrorists who carried out the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States.\u201d\n\nActually, there were a total of 19 hijackers \u2014 not 12.\n\nIn a tweet later that day, a spokeswoman for Pence, Katie Waldman, clarified that the vice president meant to say that \u201c12 of the 19\u201d terrorists \u201ctransited through Afghanistan\u201d and \u201c10 of those 12 were assisted by Soleimani.\u201d In an email, she told us that was highlighted in an April 2019 fact sheet on the State Department\u2019s designation of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, including the Quds Force, as a terrorist organization.\n\n\u201cThe IRGC, with the support of the Iranian government, has engaged in terrorist activity since its inception 40 years ago,\u201d the fact sheet stated. The document then said Iran \u201charbors terrorists within its own borders, thereby facilitating their activities.\u201d It added: \u201cIn 2016, the U.S. Treasury Department identified and sanctioned three senior [al Qaeda] operatives residing in Iran and noted that Iran had knowingly permitted these AQ members, including several of the 9/11 hijackers, to transit its territory on their way to Afghanistan for training and operational planning.\u201d\n\nThe 9/11 Commission Report from 2004 also concluded that \u201cthere is strong evidence that Iran facilitated the transit of al Qaeda members into and out of Afghanistan before 9/11, and that some of these were future 9/11 hijackers.\u201d The report said that \u201c8 to 10 of the 14 Saudi \u2018muscle\u2019 operatives traveled into or out of Iran between October 2000 and February 2001,\u201d and that \u201cseveral of the 9/11 hijackers\u201d took \u201cadvantage of the Iranian practice of not stamping Saudi passports,\u201d a policy Iran instituted to improve relations with al Qaeda.\n\nBut neither the State Department document nor the 9/11 Commission Report mentioned Soleimani, or directly tied Iran\u2019s passport policy to him.\n\nAlthough, as a high-ranking Iranian official, it may be that Soleimani knew about the policy and supported it, as Michael Rubin, a Middle East scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, has argued.\n\nStill, the 9/11 Commission said it \u201cfound no evidence that Iran or Hezbollah,\u201d an Iranian supported militant group, \u201cwas aware of the planning for what later became the 9/11 attack.\u201d Its report also said, \u201cAt the time of their travel through Iran, the al Qaeda operatives themselves were probably not aware of the specific details of their future operation.\u201d\n\nThose details would not have been apparent to anyone who read Pence\u2019s tweet, which may have suggested a direct link between Soleimani and the 9/11 attacks.", "lang": "en"}
