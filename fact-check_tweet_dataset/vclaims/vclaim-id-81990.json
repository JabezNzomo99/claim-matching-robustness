Rendell told Politico reporter Burgess Everett her remarks were \"probably a little extreme.\"\n\n\"I love Katie, but I\u2019m not one for name calling,\" he said. \"I think there\u2019s too much disrespect in the business.\" He also said that she responded correctly in apologizing.\n\nIs Rendell truly \"not one for name calling?\" It\u2019s tough to agree. We vividly remember the time he name-called the whole country.\n\nThis was back in 2010, after the NFL bumped a late December Eagles home game against the Minnesota Vikings from a Sunday to a Tuesday due to weather. \"We've become a nation of wusses. The Chinese are kicking our butt in everything,\" he told a local radio station. \"If this was in China do you think the Chinese would have called off the game? People would have been marching down to the stadium, they would have walked and they would have been doing calculus on the way down.\"\n\nAfter his comments went viral, Rendell not only stuck to his guns, in 2012 he published a book on the topic: A Nation of Wusses: How America's Leaders Lost the Guts to Make Us Great.\n\nWuss appears to be a common word in the Rendell lexicon. He called Chris Christie one in 2014 for rooting for the Cowboys. In 2012, he called then-Virginia Gov. Bob McConnell one for not voicing support for a ban on semiautomatic weapons.\n\n\"I like Gov. McDonnell and think he does some good things, but he is being nothing but a coward and a wuss when he won\u2019t confront the question,\" he stated on MSNBC. That same year, the Wall Street Journal and Boston Globe reported that despite condemning stimulus funding, Paul Ryan had actually requested some. By Rendell\u2019s measure, Ryan was \"a total wuss for denouncing something and then asking for money from it, and stating that it\u2019s going to create jobs,\" as he told HuffPostLive. \"Had Paul Ryan read my book, he would not have made [this] mistake he made on the campaign.\"\n\nIt\u2019s also hard to forget when, in 2011, Rendell didn\u2019t appreciate some of \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Leslie Stahl\u2019s questions. She was asking whether gambling legalization could have a poor influence on gambling addicts. Rendell reacted: \"You\u2019re not getting it. Those people would lose that money anyway. Don\u2019t you understand?\" Then... he popped off: \"You guys don\u2019t get that! You\u2019re simpletons! You\u2019re idiots if you don\u2019t get that.\"\n\nLast year, after the Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia, Republican lawmakers in Congress backed a plan to cut Amtrak funding by $252 million. \"Those SOBs, and that\u2019s all I can call them, these SOBs didn\u2019t even have the decency to table the vote,\" he told MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes.\n\nAnd this May, he observed that many US women are \"ugly.\" He felt, when assessing potential damage Donald Trump\u2019s comments could have on his campaign, that one should consider the relative unattractiveness of women in the country. \"For every one he\u2019ll lose 1\u00bd , two Republican women. Trump\u2019s comments like \u2018You can\u2019t be a 10 if you\u2019re flat-chested,\u2019 that\u2019ll come back to haunt him,\" he told the Washington Post. \"There are probably more ugly women in America than attractive women. People take that stuff personally.\"\n\nRendell told Everett, \"I\u2019m not one for name calling.\"\n\nPennsylvanians know: Rendell can put his foot in his mouth. But he also can very purposefully read a fellow politician(s) for filth during a live broadcast.\n\nWe\u2019re not judging. We\u2019re just saying.\n\nWe rule this claim a Pants on Fire.", "lang": "en"}
