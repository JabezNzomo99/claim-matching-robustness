This claim is false; both the WHO and Indian officials clarified that the \"protocol\" is fake.\n\nThe claim was published here on Facebook on April 5, 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post states, in part: \u201c*WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION PROTOCOL&PROCEDURE OF LOCKDOWN PERIODS FOR CONTROLLING ON MOST DANGEROUS VIRUS / STEP 1 - 1 DAY. STEP 2- 21 DAYS. AFTER 5 DAYS. STEP 3- 28 DAYS. AFTER 5 DAYS. STEP 4 - 15 DAYS\u201d.\n\nIt goes on to describe a timeline when the Indian government is expected to follow the purported WHO guidelines, starting on March 22 and ending June 10.\n\nAccording to the WHO\u2019s April 13 report, at least 106,000 people have been killed by COVID-19 and nearly 1.7 million others have been infected worldwide.\n\nIn an effort to counter the COVID-19 crisis, India on March 24, 2020, announced a 21-day nationwide lockdown. Here is an AFP report on the government decision.\n\nSimilar claims have also been shared here and here on Facebook and here and here on Twitter.\n\nHowever, the claim is false.\n\nA WHO representative to India told AFP during a telephone conversation on April 5, 2020: \u201cThis is a fake advisory, WHO does not have any guidelines for a lockdown.\u201d\n\nThe WHO's regional office for Southeast Asia also refuted the false claim in this tweet published on April 5, 2020.\n\nIt reads: \u201cMessages being circulated on social media as WHO protocol for lockdown are baseless and fake. WHO does not have any protocols for lockdowns.\"\n\nIndia\u2019s state-run Press Information Bureau also issued this tweet on April 5, 2020, which shows a screenshot of the misleading post overlaid with a \u201cFAKE!\u201d stamp.", "lang": "en"}
