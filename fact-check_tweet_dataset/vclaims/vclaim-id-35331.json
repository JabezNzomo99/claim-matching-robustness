Aniston\u2019s publicist debunked the claim in an email statement to the Daily Caller.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first social media users have made dubious claims about Aniston\u2019s political affiliation. The \u201cFriends\u201d actress appeared last year in a doctored image on Facebook wearing a lewd Biden campaign shirt.\n\n\u201cMe and all the Trump supporter celebrities decided to make a company named \u2018Celebrities for Trump,\u2019 which fights against all anti Trump celebrities,\u201d a viral post now credits Aniston with saying. \u201cI think President Trump needs our support.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, no evidence of Aniston or any other celebrities starting such a company. The Caller found no record of any corporation or limited liability company called \u201cCelebrities for Trump\u201d registered with the office of the California secretary of state.\n\n\u201cThe story [in question] is absurd and 100 percent false,\u201d Aniston\u2019s publicist, Stephen Huvane, told the Caller in an email. \u201cJennifer has never said that statement nor would she ever start any organization that would support Trump.\u201d (RELATED: Did Jennifer Aniston Wear A \u2018Handsy\u2019 Joe Biden T-Shirt?)\n\nAniston has supported at least one Democratic candidate this election cycle, making the claim even more dubious. In May 2019, the \u201cFriends\u201d actress donated $250 to South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s campaign, according to Federal Election Commission documents. She has previously contributed $36,100 to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and $30,700 to the Democratic National Committee.\n\nThe claim, debunked by Snopes in 2017, originated with the headline of an article that combined a story about a Saturday Night Live skit poking fun at Trump and a story about a debunked rumor that Aniston launching a clothing line with the Home Shopping Network.", "lang": "en"}
