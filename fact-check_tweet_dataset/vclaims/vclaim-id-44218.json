Once you see that it means they suspect you have it, it doesn\u2019t mean you have. We also have positive\u2026we have three things: we have confirmed, positive and we have death. When you see \u201cconfirmed\u201d it means it has gotten to the stage where they quarantine you to see if you have the disease in your system...We had the experts\u2026we\u2019ve had the former Director-General, Dr Nsiah-Asare, explain to us that when we see confirmed it does not mean the person has tested positive but that \u201cconfirmed\u201d means we suspect it,\u201d Mr Abronye said.\n\nWhen asked by the host of the show if the word \u201cconfirmed\u201d really means a person does not have Covid-19, Mr Abronye responded that it depends on the interpretation one wants to give it.\n\nBut what do experts mean by \u201cconfirmed\u201d in relation to Covid-19 cases?\n\nDubawa spoke to Dr James Aboagye, a postdoctoral fellow at the Noguchi Memorial Centre, who stated that from the Noguchi\u2019s end, a confirmed case is a case that has tested positive.\n\n\u201cA confirmed case is a positive case because what we are looking for is the virus and once a person is confirmed, he or she is positive for the virus,\u201d Dr Aboagye said.\n\nHe further stated that unlike suspected cases where the individual is assumed or thought to have the virus, confirmed cases are for scenarios where the individual tests positive for the virus after tests have been run.\n\nThe Public Relations Officer of Ghana Health Service (GHS), Jacob Andoh, said a person who has been tested and found positive is the same as a confirmed case.\n\n\u201cA confirmed case is the same as a positive case,\u201d Mr Andoh said.\n\nThe WHO case classifications are categorized into suspected cases, probable cases and confirmed cases.\n\nSuspected Case refers to three situations: 1) a patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough, shortness of breath) and a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset; 2) a patient with any acute respiratory illness and has been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19 case in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset; and 3) a patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough, shortness of breath, requiring hospitalization) and in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that fully explains the clinical presentation.\n\nProbable Case: A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive or a suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason.\n\nConfirmed Case: A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.\n\nThe CDC also categorises Covid-19 diagnoses into three stages:\n\nPerson Under Investigation: This is a person who has exhibited symptoms of COVID-19 and is in the process of being tested.\n\nPresumptive Positive: This is an individual who tested positive for COVID-19 at a state or local laboratory. At least one respiratory sample must be positive for a case to be labelled presumptive positive.\n\nConfirmed Positive: This is a person who tested positive for COVID-19 at a CDC laboratory. At least one respiratory sample must be positive by the CDC for it to be labelled confirmed positive.\n\nIn Ghana, reports on the coronavirus surveillance are based on the confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths as seen on the GHS website. Confirmed cases have been regarded as positive cases and not suspected as claimed by Mr Abronye.\n\nTherefore, Mr Abroye\u2019s incorrect claim on the definition of \u2018confirmed\u2019 cases is a misleading semantic confusion that should be disregarded.\n\nWHO\u2019s classifications are unambiguous and remain the standard for the whole world facing the same virus. The denotative meaning of the word confirm in English\u2013British or American\u2013dictionary is semantically too distant from \u2018suspect\u2019 in standard English usage.", "lang": "en"}
