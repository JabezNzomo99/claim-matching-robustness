The photo is being used in a misleading context; it actually shows the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in Florida. Previously, the same photo was also wrongly described as showing another proposed long-span bridge in the Philippines. Philippine authorities say the government is still studying the feasibility of constructing the Bataan-Cavite Interlink Bridge.\n\nThe photo was published here on Facebook on October 6, 2019.\n\nIt shows an aerial view of a long-span bridge.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Tagalog-language caption translates to English as: \"JIMMY Z POWERADIO NEWS\n\n\n\n \"'HEART' THIS BECAUSE IT'S COMING SOON\n\n\n\n \"PROPOSED BATAAN-CAVITE BRIDGE\".\n\nBataan and Cavite are Philippine provinces near the capital Manila.

The bridge is listed on page 117 of this midterm government report.\n\nAFP had asked the Philippine public works agency for the latest details on the proposed bridge.\n\nIn an email on October 9, 2019, it said a feasibility study is still ongoing.\n\nA portion of the email reads: \u201cStarted in November 2018, [a feasibility study] for the 32.15-kilometer bridge project is now 87% complete.\u201d\n\nThe public works agency also sent AFP an information card showing bridge alignment options, a model image of a long-span bridge, and further details about the project.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the information card:", "lang": "en"}
