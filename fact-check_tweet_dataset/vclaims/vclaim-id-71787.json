Multiple Facebook and Twitter posts shared the news. But the report is false; the BBC denied publishing any such news; Indian jail authorities and Malik\u2019s lawyer told AFP that Malik was alive.\n\nOn August 4, 2019, Pakistan\u2019s Urdu-language Channel 5 News reported that Malik had died, attributing the information to British public broadcaster the BBC.\n\nThe original video report was quickly taken down from the Channel 5 site, but the footage continued to circulate on social media, for example in this Facebook post published August 5, 2019.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Facebook post:\n\nThe \u201cBig News\u201d report combines an image of Malik with text that translates as: \u201cHurriyat leader Yasin Malik attained martyrdom inside an Indian prison, claims BBC.\u201d\n\nThe post is captioned: \u201cYaseen Malik die in Indian jail news from BBC.\u201d\n\nYasin Malik is a separatist leader in Indian-administered Kashmir. He is the chairman of Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), an organisation which was banned by Indian government in March 2019 as reported here.\n\nMalik was arrested on April 10, 2019 by India\u2019s national investigation agency in connection with a case related to the funding of terror and separatist groups in Indian-administered Kashmir. He has been held in Delhi's Tihar jail since then.\n\nHurriyat is the united front of separatist organisations in Indian-administered Kashmir, which includes Malik\u2019s JKLF.\n\nThe BBC said in a tweet on August 4, 2019 that it had not reported Malik\u2019s death:\n\nMultiple other Facebook posts, for example here on August 4, 2019, shared the misleading claim that Malik has died, without mentioning Channel 5 or the BBC.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the August 4 post, which has been shared more than 450 times:\n\nThe caption of the misleading post reads: \"News have been confirmed from Pakistan. Yaseen Malik had died in jail.\"\n\nThe same claim was made in other Facebook posts, for example here and here, and here on Twitter.\n\nSenior police officer and Tihar Jail spokesperson Rajkumar told an AFP journalist in Delhi by telephone on August 5, 2019: \u201cThe reports of Yasin Malik\u2019s death are untrue. He is fine and currently lodged in Tihar.\u201d\n\nMalik\u2019s lawyer Raja Mohammad Tufail also told AFP that the claim was false.\n\nSpeaking to an AFP journalist in Delhi by telephone on August 5, 2019, he said: \u201cI met my client Yasin Malik today. He is hale and hearty and doing well. The reports of death or ill-health are false.\u201d\n\nThe Director-General of Tihar Prison, Sandeep Goel, also told Indian media that rumours of Malik\u2019s death were a hoax, for example here and here.\n\nHere is a video of Rajkumar explaining the situation, published by Indian broadcaster News18:\n\nHe says: \"The rumour going about Yasin Malik who is presently lodged in Tihar prison is incorrect. His health condition is normal and he is doing fine.\"", "lang": "en"}
