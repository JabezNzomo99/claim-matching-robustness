Until the president\u2019s statements, however, even internet speculation did not attribute CrowdStrike\u2019s ownership to a rich Ukrainian or suggest that the D.N.C. servers were hidden in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe have never taken physical possession of any DNC servers,\u201d CrowdStrike said in a blog post. \u201cWhen cyber investigators respond to an incident, they capture that evidence in a process called \u2018imaging.\u2019 It involves making an exact byte-for-byte copy of the hard drives. They do the same for the machine\u2019s memory, capturing evidence that would otherwise be lost at the next reboot, and they monitor and store the traffic passing through the victim\u2019s network. This has been standard procedure in incident response investigations for decades. The images, not the computer\u2019s hardware, provide the evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat they need to see is how the traffic moves,\u201d said Rid, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. If investigators were surveilling a house, Rid said, they would want to know who goes in and out. The same is true of investigating server traffic, he added. Having the physical object, whether a house or a server, is not nearly as helpful as knowing who goes in and out, Rid said.\n\n\u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it,\u201d Trump told Zelensky, according to the rough transcript of the phone call released by the White House. \u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you\u2019re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it\u2019s very important that you do it if that\u2019s possible.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
