Although police abuses have been reported in the past months, only two of the four photos shared depict the recent anti-government protests, while the others predate current president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s election.\n\nOn Facebook, \u201cyellow vest\u201d supporters in the UK and North America have shared a collage of the same four photos nearly 50,000 times since the beginning of February, supposedly proof of police repression during the anti-government movement in France.\n\nThe top photo was indeed taken during a \u201cyellow vest\u201d protest in Paris. The November 24, 2018 protest on the capital\u2019s Champs Elys\u00e9es avenue led to the burning of a truck, seen on the left of the image taken by Paris Match photographer Pascal Rostain.\n\nThe bottom right photo featuring three \u201cyellow vests\u201d protesters wearing masks, one of whom is injured, is also from the ongoing anti-government mobilization. It was taken in Paris by AP photographer Thibault Camus in December 2018.\n\nThe bottom left photo, depicting a bleeding man surrounded by French riot police dates back to September 2016, during mobilizations against a reform of French labour laws. AFP Fact Check was not able to identify the photographer of the image, which was published amid other pictures on this Turkish website.\n\nThe photo of a bearded man raising his blood-covered hands, (bottom-center of the post), is an AFP photo from June 14, 2016, and also dates back to protests against the labour laws reform. AFP photographer Alain Jocard captured the scene and took other photos of the same man, which are available here.\n\nThe earliest posts using the photos out of context originated in Latin America and included a photo taken in Spain in 2017. Eventually, the images were shared in France as well.\n\nThis instance of the post also features, on the center right, a photo of a man dragged by French riot police. However, the photo was first published in March 2016 by a Russian TV station, which took credit for the footage. It was also taken during protests against labour law reforms.\n\nViolence during the \u201cyellow vest\u201d protests has been widely reported since the first protest in November 2018. The French agency in charge of investigating police wrongdoing, the IGPN, had opened 116 investigations as of February 9, a police source told AFP.\n\nAccording to the French anti-police brutality collective \u201cDesarmons-les,\u201d 146 people were injured in clashes with police since November 17, 2018.", "lang": "en"}
