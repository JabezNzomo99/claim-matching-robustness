Now he falsely says he's keeping his promise through the revised trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. That's bunk.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2019-01-08T08:00:48.778Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-86188", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/01/08/president-trumps-desperate-nonsensical-claim-that-mexico-is-paying-wall/", "vclaim": "Now President Trump faces a similar conundrum: He promised that Mexico would pay for his plan to build a wall along the southern border. But he did not make this promise just once or even two dozen times. From his announcement speech to the election, he declared 212 times that Mexico would pay for the wall, according to the comprehensive record of Trump\u2019s speeches, interviews and tweets maintained by Factba.se. That works out to almost every two days during the campaign.\n\n\u201cThe fact is we are both in a little bit of a political bind because I have to have Mexico pay for the wall \u2014 I have to,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI have been talking about it for a two-year period.\u201d He pleaded with the Mexican president not to say that Mexico would not pay for it. \u201cYou cannot say that to the press. The press is going to go with that, and I cannot live with that,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the trade deficit with Mexico has been climbing during the Trump presidency, so by his own (nonsensical) math, he\u2019s already in deficit. Even if the trade deal results in a smaller trade deficit because Mexico is buying more goods from the United States, it does not necessarily translate into greater revenue for the U.S. government. NAFTA eliminated tariffs between Mexico and Canada, so there is no additional revenue to earn by somehow causing trade to increase with lower tariffs.", "lang": "en"}
