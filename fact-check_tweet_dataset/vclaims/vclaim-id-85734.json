After all, the president made a direct link to the impact of his policies: \u201cSo what happened two days ago and a month ago \u2014 wages are now, for the first time in many years, rising.\u201d He even stated that more companies are \u201cpursuing pay increases\u201d than at any point in the 21st century.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s confusing in this conversation is that there are different metrics available: hourly wages, weekly wages, nominal wage growth, real wage growth and so forth. That allows politicians to pick and choose the statistic that puts their policies in the best light.\n\nBut there is little dispute among economists that wage growth \u2014 after being essentially being flat for years \u2014 started to pick up again in 2014, after reaching a post-Great Recession low. In other words, Trump is simply blowing smoke when he claims that when he was campaigning that people thought it was impossible for wages to rise again. Wages were already increasing, though the increases were lower than what would be expected in a mature recovery and the impact was uneven, as shown by this chart from the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution.\n\nIndeed, after adjusting for inflation, U.S. wages were only 10 percent higher in 2017 than they were in 1973, with annual real wage growth just below 0.2 percent, according to a Hamilton Project analysis. This is the most important number \u2014 the one that decides whether you will have more money in your pocket at the end of the day.\n\nJay Shambaugh, who heads the Hamilton Project, noted that digging deeper in the BLS\u2019s 2.9 percent figure, supervisory managers saw significant gains, with those in the finance area experiencing a jump of more than 4 percent. Meanwhile, wages for production nonsupervisory workers who make up the bottom 80 percent remained at 2.4 percent growth. So the top-line 2.9 percent figure reflects gains made by the top 20 percent.\n\nFor the purposes of this fact check, real wage growth for most workers in 2017, Trump\u2019s first year as president, actually lagged the last four years of Barack Obama\u2019s term. \u201cReal wage growth in 2017 for production nonsupervisory workers in 2017 was 0.2 percent, the lowest since 2012,\u201d Shambaugh said. \u201cFor the bulk of workers, purchasing power did not rise very much in 2017.\u201d\n\nThe same holds true when looking at real median weekly wages for all workers in 2017, a data point the White House has cited in the past. Trump started bragging about wages after the data indicated a gain from the first to the second quarter, to $353 per week. (For complicated reasons, the BLS data is listed in 1982-1984 dollars.) But then it was basically flat in the third quarter. Wages then plunged to $345 in the fourth quarter, so that it was actually lower than number for the fourth quarter of 2016, $349, when Trump took office. Oops.\n\nTo sum up, the president made a number of outlandish claims about increased wages. He suggests they have been stagnant until recently; actually, they increased starting in 2014 but for many workers were stagnant in 2017, the president\u2019s first year in office. There was an apparent increase in the January data, but the ultimate impact after inflation remains to be seen. Moreover, as has been the case in the past, most workers did not experience the gain that Trump is touting.", "lang": "en"}
