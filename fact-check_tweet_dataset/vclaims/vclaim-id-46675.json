Let\u2019s try to analyze the authenticity of the newspaper clip. \n\n\n\nClaim: An American DNA expert has revealed that Rahul Gandhi is not the son of Rajiv Gandhi. Fact: No newspaper article that reported about any American DNA expert making the above revelation was found. The newspaper clip in the post with such news is a digitally created one. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWhen googled for any news regarding \u201cRahul Gandhi is not the son of Rajiv Gandhi\u201d, no information is found to be reported in the media. In the newspaper clip, it was mentioned that Dr Martin Sijo has held a press conference and revealed that Rahul is not the son of Rajiv Gandhi. But, it is quite unlikely that such a conference goes unnoticed without any media coverage. Also, no information was found about any American DNA expert Dr Martin Sijo. So, the newspaper clip in the post is a fake one, and it would have been created digitally.\n\nEarlier this year, when a similar newspaper clip was in circulation claiming \u2018Modi as the son of Asaram Bapu\u2019, \u2018FACTLY\u2019 had debunked it and the article can be read here.\n\nTo conclude, the newspaper clip that claims \u2018Rahul Gandhi is not the son of Rajiv Gandhi\u2019 is fake.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
