The graphic is attributed to Inquirer.net, a Philippine media outlet. The claim is false; the graphic has been doctored from an earlier Inquirer.net post in which Robredo was quoted about confusion surrounding the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe graphic was published in this Facebook post on March 17, 2020 and has been shared almost 200 times. It quotes Philippine Vice President Leni Robredo.\n\nThe post's layout is identical to graphics published by Inquirer.net and includes a link to the organisation\u2019s website.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe Tagalog-language quote in the graphic translates to English as: \"The virus is not our enemy, but bats.\u201d\n\nThe post\u2019s caption translates to English as: \"What bats? You're a big Virus leni Robredo!\"\n\nSome comments on the post from Facebook users indicated that they believed the quote attributed to Robredo to be genuine.\n\nSome of the comments translate to English as: \"Our vice president is getting senile\"; \"She is so stupid\"; and \"Go ahead have all bats killed vice pres.they're the enemy after all / God made bats / humans abused them\".\n\nBelow is a screenshot of some of the comments:\n\nThe spread of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). It was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. Scientists around the world are racing to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, which they suspect may have originated in bats or snakes, AFP reported here on January 23, 2020.\n\nThe same graphic was published alongside a similar claim in separate Facebook posts here, here and here.\n\n\u201cThe Inquirer.net did not produce the image,\u201d the outlet said in this Facebook post on March 18, 2020. Inquirer.net also published a side-by-side comparison of the manipulated graphic and the original quote card, telling readers to \u201cbeware of edited images\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of Inquirer.net\u2019s post:\n\nThe original Inquirer.net quote card, which was published on Facebook here on March 16, 2020, quotes Robredo commenting on confusion surrounding the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak. The report on her remarks was published here.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s confusion among them; they\u2019re not talking. Ideally, they should\u2019ve ensured that when the President faced the public the other night, they\u2019ve already talked about the details so that the President when he gives the statement or if not the President, whoever official, so it would not be to each his own,\u201d Robredo said, according to Inquirer.net\u2019s translation.\n\nA Google search of the quote stated in the fake graphic also found that there is no publicly available evidence to suggest that Robredo made the alleged remarks about bats.", "lang": "en"}
