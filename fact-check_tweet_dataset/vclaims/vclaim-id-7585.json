Does the evidence back up this reputation?\n\nCitizen TV\u2019s journalist referred us to a 2018 report by\n\n\u201cIt is estimated that in the coastal town of Mtwapa alone, between 10,000 and 20,000 children are trafficked annually for the purpose of sex tourism,\u201d the organisation\u2019s \u201crapid assessment report\u201d\n\nThe organisation told Africa Check it had\n\nthe statistic to a 2015 publication by the\n\n. But this study, which only focused on Nairobi, didn\u2019t contain the number.\n\nTracing the claim back to its apparent source - by way of various\n\nThe report is titled \u201cThe Extent and Effect of Sex Tourism and Sexual Exploitation of Children on the Kenyan Coast\u201d. It is the most recent report Unicef has published on the subject, Catherine Kimotho, who focuses on child protection at the agency, told Africa Check.\n\n\u201csome ten to fifteen thousand girls living in [the] coastal areas of Malindi, Mombasa, Kilifi and Diani are involved in casual sex work \u2013 up to 30% of all 12-18 year olds living in these areas. A further two to three thousand girls and boys are involved in full-time year round commercial activity.\u201d\n\nThis adds up to 18,000 children in sex work - but over a much wider area than just Mtwapa, which lies in Kilifi County.\n\nHow did Unicef arrive at its estimates?\n\nUnicef\u2019s study had initially intended to survey primary schools in the region, but failed to get official approval,\n\nIt then turned to four other methods to arrive at its estimate:\n\u2022 None Key informant interviews of 230 people, nearly half of them tourists.\n\u2022 None Focus group discussions that included 23 interviews with persons and groups with specialised knowledge of the child sex trade.\n\u2022 None Hourly recording of the number of tourists and children entering and exiting places where sex tourism was known to be common.\n\u2022 None Diaries issued to girls under 18 who admitted to sex with tourists. Although 215 were distributed, only 84 were used in the study because most weren\u2019t returned or were incomplete or falsified. \n\n\n\n\n\nRespondents and focus group participants were asked to estimate the number of children in the sex industry. The researchers said they then compared these estimates to their own observations before using population data to make\n\nof the extent of the trade.\n\nBut the report noted several challenges, including respondents\u2019 reluctance to talk about the child sex trade because they feared a crackdown by officials in a region heavily dependent on tourism.\n\nExperts told Africa Check that the methods the study used to estimate the population of child sex workers had significant weaknesses.\n\n\u201cOut of all these methods, the only one that can acceptably give estimates was enumeration,\u201d said Dr Albert Manyuchi,\n\nHe explained that the Unicef researchers should have followed the counting with focused observations as well as a questionnaire that gathered information on the behaviour of the target population group.\n\nAndrew Carlson is an associate professor at\n\non development communication for Unicef, and studied sex worker populations in South Africa around the 2010 World Cup.\n\nThe estimate of 10,000 children involved in sex work in Mtwapa at any given time was questionable, he said.\n\n\u201cA study like this, that is mostly qualitative in nature, is very good to describe the factors that lead to children being involved in the industry,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t designed in a way that would yield a strong conclusion about the number of children involved.\u201d\n\nHe explained that those interviewed \u201cbasically guess[ed] at how many children they know might be involved\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt may be that the 10,000 is the true number, but I would be very hesitant to make that claim based on the methodology of the Unicef report.\u201d\n\nConclusion Major flaws in study pointing to thousands of children in sex trade on Kenyan coast\n\nCitizen TV claimed that \u201cover 10,000\u201d children were involved the sex trade in Mtwapa, a popular tourism town on the Kenyan coast.\n\nThe claim was based on a report that, in turn, eventually led to a 2006 Unicef study. This stated that up to 18,000 children were involved in the sex trade \u2013 along most of the Kenyan coast, not just in Mtwapa.\n\nMore than this, experts told Africa Check that the methods used to arrive at the figure had significant flaws. Child sex work is rightly a major concern for Kenya\u2019s coastal region, but solutions to ending it have to be crafted using the right information.", "lang": "en"}
