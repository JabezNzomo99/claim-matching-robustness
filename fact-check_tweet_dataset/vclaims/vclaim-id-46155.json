No news reporting could be found to corroborate the events described in the article.\n\nWith more than 132,000 confirmed cases and some 16,523 deaths to date, Italy has become one of the epicenters of the global coronavirus pandemic, according to data from the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. An article making the rounds on social media claims that more than 3,000 of Italy\u2019s total COVID-19 related deaths can be linked to Kerr.\n\n\u201cItaly arrest Doctor for intentionally killing over 3,000 coronavirus patients,\u201d reads the headline of the story from News NT, a self-described \u201cbreaking news\u201d blog. The deaths purportedly occurred after Kerr ignored \u201cthe approved medical procedures for treating coronavirus patients,\u201d according to the article.\n\nHowever, the story appears to be a fabrication. No additional news reporting could be found about the alleged murders committed by Kerr, and the story itself fails to link or cite any sources for its claim.

The Tribune, a Bahamian newspaper, recounted in a March 4 article how a doctor with the same name treated patients after a 2013 mass shooting in the Bahamas. But there is no indication that this is the same man the News NT article claims worked in Italy with coronavirus patients.\n\nThe photo of the doctor flanked by police officers that\u2019s featured in the Facebook post is also unrelated to Italy\u2019s coronavirus outbreak. Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller News Foundation discovered that it originated in a 2015 story from the Indiana-based Herald Bulletin. The man pictured is Dr. Eric Jones, a Pendleton, Indiana, physician who was arrested and charged with several drug-related offenses in 2014.\n\nDue to a lack of news reporting to corroborate the News NT article, we rate this claim false.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
