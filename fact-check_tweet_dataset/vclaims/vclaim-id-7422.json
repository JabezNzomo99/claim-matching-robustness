Germany doesn\u2019t have a maximum amount for its state pension.\n\nCompared to these other countries, the UK state pension is essentially a flat rate with the exact amount dependent on years of contributions and age. Spanish, German and French pensions are calculated using more complex formulas that depend on previous earnings, so their maximum weekly pensions appear higher as those would be for the countries\u2019 higher earners.\n\nMany UK workers pay into additional non-compulsory workplace pensions as well, and those are dependent on earnings.\n\nSo what are these pensions worth?\n\nThe figures in this viral image have appeared in the media before, albeit in annual terms. We think they originate from a table in a Which? article published in 2013. It\u2019s no longer online, but Which? provided us with a copy.\n\nThe table cites the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the International Social Security Association (ISSA) as sources. The OECD told us it was not the source of the monetary figures. We\u2019ve asked the ISSA for more information as we can\u2019t find the exact figures the table refers to.\n\nThe EU collects data on social security in 32 countries, including information on pension systems and payments. As of January 2018, it reported that Spain had a minimum means-tested pension, which works out at around \u00a3155 a week for a single person, while the maximum possible is around \u00a3535 a week.\n\nThe minimum French pension is \u00a3130 a week and the maximum is around \u00a3340 a week.\n\nIn Germany, most workers\u2019 pension insurance payments are compulsory but there is no statutory minimum, maximum or full pension.\n\nThe full state pension in the UK is now between \u00a3125 and \u00a3165 a week, depending on when you were born and your national insurance contributions. This doesn\u2019t include any additional state pension, pension credit, or other benefits a pensioner might be eligible for.\n\nAs well as the pensions schemes discussed above, France, Spain and Germany all have safety net social assistance payments for the elderly, where income and assets are taken into account so poorer pensioners get more. The OECD last collected this information in all four countries for the year 2016.\n\nUsing the 2016 exchange rate, this type of payment could top up pensioners\u2019 income to around \u00a3150 a week in France and Germany, and \u00a380 a week in Spain.\n\nThe OECD told us these amounts are comparable to pension credit in the UK, which is an income-related benefit that (in 2016) could top up a single pensioner\u2019s weekly income to \u00a3155 a week if their state pension and other earnings were below that. For 2015/16, the government estimates that 40% of families eligible for pension credit weren\u2019t claiming it, leaving up to \u00a33.3 billion of available pension credit unclaimed.\n\nSo in this respect, UK pensioners can expect slightly more money from the government than their European counterparts, although comparing gross figures doesn\u2019t take into account different average incomes and cost of living in these four countries.\n\nWhere do pensioners\u2019 earnings come from?\n\nComparing each country\u2019s social assistance payments with the UK\u2019s pension credit, doesn\u2019t take into account the range of financial benefits available to UK pensioners.\n\nWinter fuel payments (between \u00a3100 and \u00a3300), free prescriptions, and free TV licences for the over 75s (worth \u00a3150.50 a year) are some of the subsidies offered to pensioners in the UK.\n\nThe OECD also looks at how different income sources contribute to the average pensioners\u2019 total earnings. Out of the four countries being compared in the viral image, the proportion of pensioners\u2019 earnings from publically provided benefits is the smallest in the UK, at just 43%. In France, Germany and Spain, it\u2019s closer to 70%.\n\nOccupational transfers, like a private workplace pension, make up 30% of older people\u2019s earnings in the UK, compared to 5% in Germany and a negligible amount in Spain and France.\n\nWhat do other comparisons show?\n\nAnother measure gives pension entitlement as a percentage of pre-retirement average earnings, and takes into account income taxes and social security contributions.\n\nIn 2017 the OECD said this figure was 82% for Spain, 75% in France, 51% in Germany and 29% for the UK. These figures have also been made into a viral image.\n\nPeople are able to retire at 65 in the UK and Spain right now, although that\u2019s set to shift to 67 in both countries.\n\nIn France the retirement age is 62. The statutory retirement age is in the process of moving from 65 to 67 in Germany.", "lang": "en"}
