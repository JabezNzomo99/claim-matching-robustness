I swear, I haven't seen a more adulating journalist than him.\"\n\nDevgan retweeted Chaudhary's tweet to call out on the fake image as well.\n\nBOOM was able to ascertain that the tweet has been morphed and the font of the headline has been tampered with. After comparing multiple graphics from the show, we found that the font of the fake viral graphic did not match with the graphics uploaded on their news channel's official Twitter handle.\n\nBOOM also found that the show was not aired between the weekend October 26 and 27. The show resumed on October 28 where Devgan debated about birth control and the take of Muslims on the same.\n\nIn fact, the news channel has not run an entire show on Baghdadi's death yet.\n\nUS President Trump announced about Baghdadi's death on October 27, via a series of tweets.", "lang": "en"}
