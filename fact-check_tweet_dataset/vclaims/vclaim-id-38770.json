Additionally, Dubawa initiated a google reverse image search, which revealed that the \u201cFox News Writer\u201d (the source) used the image out of context.\n\nNews of this viral statement attributed to the former Nigeria president has been trending on all media platforms. Particularly yesterday, March 4, Dubawa received this screenshot from several users on WhatsApp; with many questioning its authenticity. The circular elicited several reactions across social media.\n\nFirstly, Dubawa reached out to Olujonwon Obasanjo (his son) via a mutual contact, to ascertain the legitimacy of the claim. We, however, got no response; we also sent a text message to him and await a response.\n\nNext, Dubawa put a call through to Kehinde Akinyemi, his spokesperson who was initially not forthcoming with the team. Notwithstanding, through the aid of a Premium Times correspondent, we were able to reach him.\n\nIt would be TV news, not blog news\n\nCustomary with the Former head of state, his known method of information dissemination, especially on matters of national importance, is through letter writing. Let\u2019s assume it was an interview, what station broadcasted it? Would it not have made the 9\u2019oclock news? These unanswered questions put a hole in this story\u2019s plot.\n\nAs it turns out, Fox News Writer published another article attributed to the former head of state in February, using the same image; this casts a cloud of scepticism on the claim\u2019s authenticity. More so, to say the article was stingy with details would be an understatement. The publication failed to cover the essential 5 Ws and H; only saying \u201cmore details soon\u201d. And this was since March 2.\n\nInterestingly, when you examine both images, they bear a Punch logo. So, Dubawa reached out the newsroom. We are yet to receive a response from them, though, all signs point to it being a doctored image. As always, we will update this fact-check once we receive new information.", "lang": "en"}
