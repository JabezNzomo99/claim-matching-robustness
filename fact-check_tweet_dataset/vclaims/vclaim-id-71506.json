The claim is misleading; as of May 27, the app named in the posts is not a contact tracing app and is not being used by New Zealand's government as part of its coronavirus strategy; to date, the government's only coronavirus contact tracing app is voluntary for businesses and the public; shops in New Zealand are also not required to record consumer information for contact tracing purposes.\n\nThe claim was published here on Facebook on May 15. It has been shared more than 1,400 times.\n\nThe post\u2019s lengthy caption reads in part: \u201cYou cannot go into a STORE, Post Shop, mall, unless you scan in the QR code posted outside with the contact tracing app, your phone camera, or sign a register (where your name. address and phone details are visible to everybody), and in some cases (people are telling me), have your photo taken.\n\n\u201cThe retailers were told that they are NOT ALLOWED TO SELL TO YOU if you don't comply.\n\n\u201cBy the way, this is NOT the $65Million Contact Tracing app that the government has made, this is an existing web-based contact app from EvaCheckin.\n\n\u201cNew Zealand has \u2018flattened the curve\u2019 and lost its Democracy.\u201d\n\nThe post also includes an image that purportedly shows instructions to scan a QR code with a phone camera or via a web link.\n\nThe claim was shared hundreds of times on Facebook here, here, here and here, and on Twitter here. It also circulated in other languages, such as in Hebrew here and here.\n\nEVA Check-in, which is referred to as a \u201cweb-based contact app from EvaCheckin\u201d in the social media posts, is an online commercial system developed by New Zealand technology consultancy Theta.\n\nAs of May 27, 2020, the programme is not a contact-tracing app and instead offers a \u201csecure, contactless way\u201d to help businesses with guest registration via the scanning of QR codes, according to Theta. EVA Check-in requires no installation, no hardware, no app download, and does not use Bluetooth or record geolocation data, the company said.\n\nThe system is not mandatory or government-related, and is available to businesses on a monthly subscription.\n\n\u201cEVA Check-in is not connected with the NZ COVID Tracer app,\u201d a Theta spokesperson told AFP in an email dated May 26. \u201cWe have worked with the Ministry of Health so that we can make sure we meet the privacy requirements for health systems, and so that we can assist the government\u2019s efforts by sharing relevant data and integrating with the Tracer app when/if such features become available from them.\u201d\n\nAs of May 27, the claim that retailers must turn away consumers who do not comply with contact-tracing measures is also misleading.\n\n\u201cRetail businesses do not need to record details of their customers. This includes shopping malls, supermarkets, marketplaces, takeaway food and retail stores,\u201d the government explains in a statement on contact tracing procedures here.\n\nNon-retail businesses and services, however, are required to record people\u2019s movements for contact tracing purposes.\n\nThe Theta spokesperson said: \u201cEVA Check-in does not ban anyone. It is the responsibility of the business to keep a guest register. If someone does not check in with EVA it is up to that business to offer a manual alternative if they wish.\u201d\n\nThe only official COVID-19 contact-tracing app in New Zealand is the government\u2019s NZ COVID Tracer.\n\nThe app was released on May 20 to \u201csupport contact tracing in New Zealand\u201d following the easing of COVID-19 lockdown measures.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Health press release; \u201cKiwis who download the app will create a digital diary of the places they visit by scanning QR codes displayed at the entrances to business premises, other organisations and public buildings.\u201d\n\nAs of May 27, the app, however, is voluntary for businesses and the public.\n\n\u201cTechnical solutions like the NZ COVID Tracer app are just one part of contact tracing and are designed to support rather than replace existing contact tracing processes,\u201d the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment states here on a FAQ page for business owners. \u201cIf you have existing manual or digital contact tracing processes in place that are effective, you can continue to use these.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
