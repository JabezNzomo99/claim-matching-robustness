That means all of the bills would be paid by one entity \u2014 the federal government \u2014 in contrast to the hodgepodge health-care system now in place. Medicare, the health care system for the elderly and disabled, is a federal single-payer plan, but people under 65 get insurance from employers, through the individual market (Obamacare) or through Medicaid, the federal-state health system for the poor. Private health insurance plans, such as those offered through employers, would be eliminated, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nTrump made this promise, but broke it. He supported Republican plans that would have weakened protections for individuals with preexisting conditions. His administration also has refused to defend the Affordable Care Act against a lawsuit that would undermine those protections. In effect, the Trump administration no longer supports a provision of the ACA, a.k.a. Obamacare, that makes it possible for people to buy insurance if they have preexisting health conditions. (We labeled this as a flip-flop.)\n\nWith the baby-boom generation retiring at a rate of 10,000 people per day, that puts pressure on the long-term financing of the program because fewer workers will be supporting more retirees. If the trust fund is depleted, that means the government would not be able to cover 100 percent of estimated expenses. Yet because of Trump\u2019s tax cut, the budget deficit is soaring even as the economy is booming, in contrast to previous periods of under-4-percent unemployment. That leaves the government less prepared to deal with the consequences of baby-boom retirements.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act actually strengthened the near-term outlook of the Part A trust fund. The law includes a 0.9 percent payroll tax that hits the wages and self-employment income of wealthier Americans \u2014 above $250,000 per couple or $200,000 for a single taxpayer. That was estimated to raise an additional $63 billion for the Part A trust fund between 2010 and 2019. The law also was estimated to cut expenses, including $162 billion in productivity adjustments to provider payments and $86 billion in reduced payments to Medicare Advantage plans. The net result was that the \u201cinsolvency\u201d date was extended by 12 years.\n\nMoreover, the $800 billion in Medicare reductions in the ACA that Trump complains about are the law of the land. In fact, Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration in their budget plans have pocketed virtually all those savings \u2014 and sought even more reductions in Medicare spending on top of that. Trump proposed $350 billion in net Medicare cuts in his budget \u2014 and there were about $540 billion in Medicare cuts assumed in the House GOP budget plan.\n\nThis is a scare scenario. Obviously, a transition to single-payer health care would lead to upheaval and uncertainty since it would encompass the entire health care system, not just the small piece covered by Obamacare. But other countries appear to manage with single-payer systems, at lower costs than the United States. Trump\u2019s vision of what would happen under single-payer echoes the fears evoked by opponents of Medicare in the 1960s and Obamacare in 2010. So there\u2019s a Chicken-Little feel to this language.\n\nMeanwhile, for years, House Republicans led by Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) have pushed for a significant overhaul of Medicare. Retirees would get from the government what Ryan called \u201cpremium support\u201d \u2014 a set payment adjusted to inflation; they would have used that money to pick from a range of plans offered by insurance companies through what is termed a Medicare exchange. But the Congressional Budget Office raised significant questions about whether the premium payment would be adequate over time.", "lang": "en"}
