Several states say such investigations are a best practice, and a task force established by President Barack Obama in 2015 recommended policies that \u201cmandate the use of external and independent prosecutors in cases of police use of force resulting in death, officer-involved shootings resulting in injury or death, or in-custody deaths.\u201d\n\nIn response, Harris told Tapper that she never took a position on any bill or ballot initiative because of her duties as attorney general. But that is not accurate. She took positions on a range of pending bills and at least one proposed ballot initiative, according to her archived news releases. (We found more than a dozen examples.)\n\nThe concern, McCarty said, is that district attorneys handle these investigations, and they work closely with the same local police officers who could come under scrutiny. \u201cThere are flaws and perceived conflicts of interest,\u201d McCarty said. After amendments, his 2015 bill would have required the attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor in cases when police use of force results in death.\n\nHarris\u2019s responsibility to write a \u201ctitle and summary\u201d applied only for ballot initiatives that had been cleared for an election, an adviser said, not legislation or proposed initiatives like the one targeting gay people. The adviser wrote in an email that Harris did not take a position on McCarty\u2019s bill because \u201cshe was concerned about taking away authority from locally elected DAs (of which she is a former one) who are held accountable by their constituents.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe next year ... she actually came out with a recommendation on this,\u201d McCarty said. He described it as three teams covering California \u201cthat would be able to step in and assist with independent investigations.\u201d McCarty said that he adopted the recommendation, is still working on the bill and hopes to get it passed but that a draft did not go through last year \u201cfor policy and money reasons.\u201d He mentioned 40 to 50 new positions split among the three teams and a $10 million budget. As for Harris, he said, \u201cShe did come around, and I was very pleased.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think she had to walk a fine line being the state\u2019s top cop and the practical purposes of such a position, and the fact that she had experience coming up as a DA,\u201d he said. In September 2016, Harris\u2019s office said she had \u201cadvocated to the governor, the speaker of the Assembly, and the Senate president pro tem for the necessary resources to create new teams within the attorney general\u2019s office to conduct criminal investigations of officer-involved shootings.\u201d\n\nFive San Francisco officers fired a total 26 rounds at Mario Woods, 26, in December 2015, killing him. Woods, who was African American, was holding a knife and did not drop it when told to do so. Harris at the time said she trusted the San Francisco district attorney to investigate the matter. That office declined to seek charges against the police officers, finding that they had had a reasonable safety concern.\n\nIt is easier to overhaul police-involved shooting investigations in smaller states such as Connecticut or Wisconsin, which have laws that provide for independent probes, McCarty said. In California, the most populated state, 157 people died during encounters with police in 2016, according to a report Becerra issued in 2017. Police fatally shot 115 people in California last year, according to The Washington Post\u2019s database of police shootings in the United States, and 162 in 2017.\n\nHarris has drawn criticism, such as in an op-ed in the New York Times, as being too tough a law enforcement officer. Her campaign noted that she opposes the death penalty and implemented a first-of-its-kind training program on implicit bias. She required her officers at the California Department of Justice to wear body cameras. Among other initiatives mentioned by the campaign, Harris also created a prisoner reentry and diversion program for nonviolent drug offenders as the San Francisco district attorney and continued it as attorney general.\n\nRegular readers know we generally do not award Pinocchios when a politician admits a mistake, as Harris has in this case. We can\u2019t explain how she got so confused by Tapper\u2019s short and specific question, but errors can occur in live events. Still, the real answer to his question, about trusting district attorneys to handle investigations into fatal shootings, might have given many viewers watching the town hall a more jaded view of her candidacy.", "lang": "en"}
