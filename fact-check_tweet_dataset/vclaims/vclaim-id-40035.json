It appears nowhere on his official social media accounts.\n\nThe \u201cHome Improvement\u201d actor is not the only celebrity whose name has been attached to statements to further a political message on social media. Steve Harvey, host of the\u201dFamily Feud\u201d game show, appeared recently in a Facebook post that incorrectly credited him with authoring a pro-Trump statement. (Related: Did Steve Harvey Author This Pro-Trump Statement?)\n\nThis Facebook post similarly attributes a lengthy anti-Democrat statement containing some factually dubious claims to Allen, seemingly in an attempt to bolster support for Trump\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\n\u201cHere are some interesting points to think about prior to 2020, especially to my friends on the fence, like moderate Democrats, Libertarians and Independents and the never Trump Republicans and those thinking of \u2018walking away\u2019 from the Democratic party,\u201d the Facebook post credits Allen with saying.\n\nAllen has made his conservative-leaning political beliefs publicly known in recent years, yet there is no evidence that Allen ever made this statement. A search of his verified social media accounts returned no results. The Daily Caller didn\u2019t find any credible sources linking the statement to him online either.\n\n\u201cThe statement you are referring to was not written by my client,\u201d confirmed Allen\u2019s publicist Marleah Leslie in an email to the Caller.\n\nIt likely got misattributed to Allen after a Facebook user with the same name posted the statement on August 25, though the account has no apparent affiliation with the actor. The statement itself dates back to at least May 21, when it appeared in a NatashaNews1 blog post without attribution.", "lang": "en"}
