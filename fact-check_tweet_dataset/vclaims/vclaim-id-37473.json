A Jan. 6 Facebook post using similar language garnered more than 150,000 shares alone.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened: The October 2013 shutdown occurred when the Republican-controlled House and Democrat-controlled Senate could not reach an agreement on a government spending plan.\n\nRepublicans, who made clear they wanted to derail the Affordable Care Act by stripping funds from it, attempted to attach to a funding bill provisions to defund or delay aspects of the act. Democrats refused to support any such move.\n\nBut the Affordable Care Act itself was enacted in 2010, and the efforts to defund it would not have been the same as repealing it because provisions of the law would have remained in effect regardless (which some Republicans at the time recognized).\n\nThe 2013 shutdown itself also didn\u2019t stop implementation of key aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Insurance enrollment through the ACA marketplace began Oct. 1, as scheduled, and premium credits to help people buy insurance were still available because the funding was outside the annual appropriations process.\n\nAfter 16 days, Congress approved funding legislation on Oct. 16, 2013, to reopen the government.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true Obama didn\u2019t concede to Republicans\u2019 demands to roll back the Affordable Care Act, it\u2019s misleading to say \u201cObama shut down the government to force Obamacare.\u201d The healthcare law was already in place and its financing already approved.\n\nSome Republicans held fellow Texas Sen. Ted Cruz responsible for pushing the shutdown (although he has denied prompting it). Cruz reportedly helped gather the support to force then-House Speaker John Boehner to pass a spending bill that would strip money from the health care law, despite the unlikely chance of it passing the Senate or being signed by Obama. Days before the shutdown, Cruz gave a 21-hour speech about the need to defund Obamacare.\n\nIn the case of the current shutdown, Trump has refused to sign an omnibus spending bill unless it includes $5.7 billion to build his promised border wall.\n\nAt a Dec. 11 Oval Office meeting, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the Democrats \u201cwant to do the same thing we did last year, this year\u201d \u2014 meaning $1.375 billion, which was how much Congress appropriated for border infrastructure in fiscal 2018. Trump refused, saying \u201cwe can build a much bigger section with more money.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck, because the people of this country don\u2019t want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nGillman, Todd. \u201cEyes roll as Ted Cruz denies role in 2013 government shutdown; \u2018Speechless\u2019 says one senator.\u201d Dallas Morning News. 22 Jan 2018.\n\n\u201cOpen enrollment in the Health Insurance Marketplace is here!\u201d HealthCare.gov. 1 Oct 2013.\n\nPage, Susan. \u201cPoll: Nearly half say replace everyone in Congress.\u201d USA Today. 21 Oct 2013.\n\n\u201cQ&A: Everything You Should Know About Government Shutdowns.\u201d Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. 7 Jan 2019.\n\nRae, Matthew et al. \u201cThe Cost of the Individual Mandate Penalty for the Remaining Uninsured.\u201d Kaiser Family Foundation. 9 Dec 2015\n\nRedhead, C.
