The post claims that, in one photo, she has the bandage on the left hand and in another photo, the bandage is on the right hand. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Aishe Ghosh faking hand injury. Two photos show bandage on different hands. Fact: One of the pictures is a flipped mirror image using a photo-editing tool. In all the photos and videos, the bandage is always on the left hand. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nOn doing Google Reverse Image Search, the same photo can be found in an article by The Wire. It can be seen in the photo that the bandage is on the left hand. \n\n\n\nOn the PTI (Press Trust of India) website, both the posted photos can be seen with the description \u2013 \u2018Aishe Ghosh press conference\u2019.

In the original photo, the bandage is on the left hand. But, the original photo has been horizontally mirrored, using a photo-editing tool, to show that the bandage is on the right hand. The video related to the press conference can be watched here.\n\nAlso, in the Indian Express article published on 07t January 2020, it can be read that Aishe Ghosh suffered an injury on the left hand\n\nTo sum it up, a mirror image created using a photo editing tool has been used to claim that Aishe Ghosh is faking hand injury.\n\nDid you watch our video on the 10 Most Ridiculous Fake News of the Year 2019?", "lang": "en"}
