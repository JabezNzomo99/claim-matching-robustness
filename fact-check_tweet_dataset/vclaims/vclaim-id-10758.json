The pineberry first emerged, or re-emerged, in 2010 (on 1 April, as a matter of fact, leading some cynics to conclude that they were an elaborate hoax) in United Kingdom markets.\n\nHowever, while they weren\u2019t a hoax, neither were they a new and exciting crossbreed of strawberry and pineapple. Also, while they weren\u2019t a lost variety miraculously resurrected by enterprising scientists, similar berries might have been around since the 18th century (and other white strawberry varieties have existed for far longer):\n\nIn fact, the specific strawberry variety whose genetics contribute to the striking appearance of the pineberry was \u201crescued\u201d by a group of Dutch farmers. They discovered the source material in France. They did not find and rescue the pineberry from extinction in the wilds of Chile, as some have claimed. After six years of plant selection and cultivation, the plant vigor and quality of the pineberry plants was improved, and the decision to begin growing them for commercial production was made. The fruit produced by pineberry plants is very aromatic and has flavor that most say is reminiscent of pineapple while retaining the texture and feel of a strawberry. The pineberry, or pineapple strawberry, is more of a novelty at present. They are produced on a very small scale in Europe and Belize and are not very profitable due to the small size of the pineberries (large pineberries are less than an inch [2.54 cm] big) and the low yield of pineberry plants\u2026.\n\nThey didn\u2019t seem to taste much like pineapple, though, according to a 2010 piece in the Guardian:\n\nWeekend\u2019s food editor, Bob Granleese, never one to hold back, was not a fan: \u201cIt smells like a strawberry.\u201d Bite. \u201cIt tastes like \u2026 water.\u201d Pause. \u201cWith sweetener in it.\u201d Pause. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting.\u201d I went next, immediately pulling a lemon sucking face at the sharpness of the albino fruit which I can only describe as \u201cnippy\u201d. Jay Rayner was similarly unimpressed: \u201cBasically, it\u2019s an unripe strawberry. Just because it can be sold doesn\u2019t mean it should\u201d. And devoted food lover Rachel Dixon was quite taken aback: \u201cWhat the hell? It\u2019s a raspberry. No. Strawberry.\u201d Nibble. \u201cUm.\u201d Pause. Grimace. \u201cWhoa\u201d. Pause. \u201cSo it\u2019s some kind of freakish strawberry that doesn\u2019t taste very nice.\u201d Not much endorsement so far.\n\nPineberries\u2019 growing season is about five weeks long, which further limits their commercial viability. However, if you feel a real need for a pineberry but aren\u2019t anywhere near a market that carries them, you can order them online or grow your own.", "lang": "en"}
