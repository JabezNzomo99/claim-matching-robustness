Los Angeles has had a Democratic mayor since 2001. \u201cOne Democrat mayor after another,\u201d one user who shared the image wrote, before asking, \u201cWhat are the voters thinking?\u201d\n\nHowever, the photo was taken in Paris, not Los Angeles. The image first appeared in a December 2015 piece by The Daily Mail titled, \u201cThe Third World shanty town\u2026 in the heart of Paris: Roma gypsies create their own village built from rubbish and scrap in one of Europe\u2019s great cities.\u201d\n\n\u201cSteam rises from the shacks\u2019 chimneys as a woman stands outside her home smoking and others get on with their everyday lives,\u201d the original image is captioned.\n\nAccording to February 2016 reporting from Vice, the camp began in summer 2015 along a defunct railroad track, at one point housing around 300 people. The village was demolished in 2016 due to safety concerns.\n\nAlthough the picture was miscaptioned, Los Angeles does have a sizable homeless population, with many people pitching tents in a district known as Skid Row.
