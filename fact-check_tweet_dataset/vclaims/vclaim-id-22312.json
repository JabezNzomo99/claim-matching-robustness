At a minimum, we expect Russia to continue using propaganda, social media, false-flag personas, sympathetic spokespeople, and other means of influence to try to exacerbate social and political fissures in the United States.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Ellen Nakashima and Shane Harris reported that this assessment \u201cstands in contrast to President Trump, who has repeatedly voiced skepticism of Russian meddling in the 2016 election\u201d and that \u201cthe disconnect between Trump and his senior-most intelligence advisers has raised concerns that the U.S. government will not be able to mount an effective plan to beat back Russian influence operations in the upcoming midterm elections.\u201d\n\nPence said that U.S. officials were on alert but that \u201cthe accepted view\u201d was that U.S. intelligence agencies had determined foreign efforts to influence the 2016 election were not successful. It was not exactly a slip of the tongue \u2014 Pence spoke in unequivocal terms and later repeated his assertion as he wrapped up his answer.\n\n\u201cLet me say again \u2026 that it is the universal conclusion of our intelligence communities that there was no impact on the outcome of the 2016 election from any foreign meddling in our elections, and I believe that bears repeating,\u201d Pence said. \u201cThe American people can be confident about the results of the election in 2016, but going forward we\u2019re going to continue to lean into this effort, continue to ensure that our state-based election systems and all of the infrastructure of this country are protected from foreign interference.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election,\u201d according to the assessment. \u201cThe U.S. intelligence community is charged with monitoring and assessing the intentions, capabilities, and actions of foreign actors; it does not analyze U.S. political processes or U.S. public opinion.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, according to the assessment, Russia tried to undermine confidence in the U.S. democratic system and in Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy and potential presidency through a series of efforts including cyberespionage and propaganda on Russian-controlled news platforms such as RT and Sputnik, by hacking the email accounts of Democratic officials and groups including Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and the Democratic National Committee and then disseminating hacked communications through WikiLeaks.\n\nThis is the declassified version of the assessment, meaning it lacks highly classified details the intelligence agencies uncovered. But the declassified report says \u201cits conclusions are identical to those in the highly classified assessment but this version does not include the full supporting information on key elements of the influence campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cPompeo \u2026 was asked at an event in Washington if he could say with absolute certainty that the election results were not skewed as a result of Russian interference,\u201d according to Reuters. \u201cPompeo replied: \u2018Yes. Intelligence community\u2019s assessment is that the Russian meddling that took place did not affect the outcome of the election.\u2019\u201d\n\nSeveral investigations are still in progress, and we do not yet know whether Russian interference affected the outcome of the 2016 election. Pence claimed U.S. spy agencies had looked into this and concluded that foreign efforts to influence the election were fruitless.\n\nEqually unambiguous was a January 2017 assessment from the intelligence community: \u201cWe did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election.\u201d That report is declassified, but its conclusions are \u201cidentical\u201d in the classified version, it says.\n\nWe rarely have such strong evidence a politician\u2019s claim is false. Contrary to what Pence said, U.S. intelligence agencies did not evaluate whether Russian interference affected the outcome of the 2016 election. It remains an open question whether that interference had an impact on the race. For this, the vice president earns Four Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
