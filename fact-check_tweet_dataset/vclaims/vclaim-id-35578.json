John Kerry's stepson never conducted any business in Ukraine, and the association between Ukraine and a Paul Pelosi Jr.-linked energy company is bogus. We also found no evidence exists of any connection between donations to the Clinton Foundation and any of the aforementioned activities.\n\nHunter Biden sat on the board of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma from 2014 to 2019. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2015 that Ukrainians had donated more than citizens of any other country to the Clinton Foundation between 1999 and 2014.\n\nAmid intensifying debate around the prospect of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment after it was revealed he had asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate unsubstantiated rumors about former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s dealings with that country, Republicans and Trump supporters hit back by attempting to tie several high-profile Democrats and their families to Ukraine.\n\nRight-leaning websites scrutinized the purported business activities of Paul Pelosi Jr., son of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and attempted to draw a meaningful connection between Ukraine and the Clintons.\n\nOn Oct. 6, the Twitter account @RealJack posted a widely-shared tweet which claimed that the sons of Biden and Pelosi, as well as those of former Secretary of State John Kerry and Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), had worked for \u201cenergy companies doing business in Ukraine\u201d:\n\n@RealJack\u2019s claims were further promulgated when multiple Facebook accounts re-posted the wording of his tweet, including the group \u201cTexas for Donald Trump 2020\u201d:\n\nOn Oct. 8, the right-leaning, Trump-supporting Twitter account @Education4Libs attempted to draw all these strands together with a widely-shared, innuendo-laden tweet claiming that an unspecified conspiracy connected donations to the Clinton Foundation with the alleged business activities of the sons of prominent Democrats: \u201cFrom 1999-2014, Ukraine donated more money to the Clinton Foundation than any other foreign country. Biden, Pelosi, Kerry, & Romney all have children working for Ukrainian gas companies. And all of the people I mentioned want Trump impeached. Are you connecting the dots yet?\u201d\n\nThese tweets constituted a mixture of some accurate statements with mostly false claims, as well as unsubstantiated suggestions of unspecified wrongdoing or corruption on the part of those involved.\n\nIn 2015, the Wall Street Journal reported that between 1999 and 2014, Ukrainians had donated more than individuals of any other nationality to the Clinton Foundation, a non-profit humanitarian organization founded by former President Bill Clinton. So @Education4Libs\u2019 claim that Ukraine as a country \u2014 rather than individual Ukrainian nationals \u2014 had topped the list of donations was not backed up by the Journal\u2019s research.\n\nHillary Clinton stepped away from her seat on the board of directors of the Clinton Foundation when she became Secretary of State in 2009. According to the foundation\u2019s website, neither she nor Bill nor Chelsea Clinton has ever derived any personal income from their involvement in the charity.\n\nHunter Biden, the former vice president\u2019s 49-year-old son, served on the board of Burisma Holdings, a major Ukrainian natural gas producer, from 2014 until April 2019, according to multiple reports. His decision to join the company\u2019s payroll caused some political discomfort at the time, since Burisma\u2019s owner had recently been embroiled in a money-laundering scandal and Biden\u2019s father, the vice president, was heading the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to discourage and crack down on corruption in Ukraine.\n\nHowever, no evidence has yet emerged suggesting that either Biden engaged in any wrongdoing with regard to Burisma or Ukraine, despite President Trump\u2019s efforts to have both men investigated. It is accurate to say that Hunter Biden worked for and was on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company, but no evidence indicates any link between his work there and Ukrainian donations to the Clinton Foundation.\n\nFurthermore, @Education4Libs claimed in October that Biden is \u201cworking for\u201d a Ukrainian gas company, but that\u2019s not correct since he stepped down from his place on the board in April 2019.\n\nPaul Pelosi Jr., son of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was at one time on the board of a California-based oil-processing company called Viscoil, according to the account he gave in a video recorded in 2010. The link between Viscoil and Ukraine is either tenuous or non-existent and does not appear to involve Pelosi at all.\n\nViscoil was linked to a somewhat shadowy figure going by the name \u201cAna Shell,\u201d who claims to be an investor and environmental entrepreneur, and claims to have provided funding to both Viscoil and another entity called NRG Lab. The purported Ukraine connection arose from a YouTube video posted by \u201cNRG Lab Research Council\u201d in 2013, whose caption stated \u201cMika Newton helped to secure the rights to build a plant for the production of SH-boxes in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThat single line from the caption of an NRG Lab promotional video was cited by Patrick Howley, who writes for The Epoch Times, a website known for promulgating pro-Trump misinformation, in advancing a link between Pelosi and an energy company that \u201cdid business in Ukraine.\u201d However, the claim that Newton, a Ukrainian singer born Oksana Stefanivna Hrytsay, had any connection to NRG Lab or Viscoil, appears to be false.\n\nWe found a Facebook page labelled \u201cMika_Newton.official\u201d which appears distinctly unofficial, has very little content apart from \u201cAna Shell\u201d promotional imagery, and includes the following description: \u201cHi, my name\u2019s Mika Newton. This is my official page to support projects that NRGLab Singapore makes\u201d:\n\nNeither Newton\u2019s actual official Facebook page nor her Instagram account (where she engages in prolific product promotion) contain any mention of NRG Lab, Viscoil, or \u201cAna Shell.\u201d The link between NRG Lab, Newton, and production rights in Ukraine appears to be bogus.\n\nIn any event, Pelosi appears to have ended his involvement with Viscoil before the bogus Mika Newton connection was ever made. A spokesperson for Speaker Pelosi told PolitiFact that: \u201cThe company [Viscoil] was based in Southern California and focused solely on U.S. business. The company later reorganized under a different name [NRG Lab], but Paul Pelosi Jr. played no role in the new entity.\u201d\n\nPelosi Jr. did travel to Ukraine in 2017, but that trip related to his work for the Corporate Governance Initiative and had no discernible link to Viscoil, NRG Lab, or \u201cAna Shell.\u201d\n\nThis claim is riddled with errors. First off, former Secretary of State and 2004 Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry doesn\u2019t have a biological son. The man in question is his stepson, Chris Heinz, who was born to Kerry\u2019s wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, and her first husband, John Heinz.\n\nHeinz appears to have been added to the list because of his former business partnership with Hunter Biden and their friend Devon Archer. The three men formed an investment firm called Rosemont Seneca, and both Archer and Biden later joined the board of Burisma. However, Heinz did not.\n\nIn fact, according to reports by The Washington Post and the Washington Examiner, Heinz expressed his own reservations about Archer and Biden\u2019s decision at the time, which underlines just how inaccurate and wrongheaded the meme\u2019s inclusion of Heinz was.\n\nA spokesperson confirmed to Snopes that Heinz had never been involved in Burisma in any way, nor had he ever worked for or sat on the board of directors of any energy company, or even traveled to Ukraine.\n\nMitt and Ann Romney have five sons, and we found no evidence that any of them have ever had any involvement with either a \u201cUkrainian gas company\u201d or an \u201cenergy company doing business in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe couple\u2019s oldest son Tagg (49) has worked as a vice president at Reebok, chief marketing officer for the Los Angeles Dodgers, founded the investment firm Solamere Capital, and worked as an advisor and surrogate during his father\u2019s 2002 Massachussetts gubernatorial campaign as well as his 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns.\n\nMatt Romney was previously marketing director for the software company LavaStorm, worked as a real estate developer in California, and as a vice president for the real estate investment firm Excel Trust (which was acquired by the private equity firm Blackstone in 2015).\n\nJosh Romney is president of the Romney Group, a Utah-based real estate and property investment firm, and chairman and owner of Intercap Lending, a mortgage lender. He previously worked as a real estate developer in Salt Lake City.\n\nBen Romney is a radiologist in Utah and Idaho, and Craig Romney, the youngest son, has worked in music production for the advertising firm McGarry Bowen and later for the real estate investment firm Sundance Bay.\n\nContrary to @Education4Libs\u2019 claim, Romney had not called for President Trump\u2019s impeachment as of Oct. 8, undermining the putative basis for the Romney family\u2019s inclusion in the nonexistent conspiracy of wrongdoing to which the meme alluded.", "lang": "en"}
