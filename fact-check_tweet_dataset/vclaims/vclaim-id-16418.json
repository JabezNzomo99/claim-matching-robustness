Just keep that in mind and stay in your place.\u201d\n\nThe story of Alfie Evans is true. The 23-month-old toddler was admitted to the hospital in December 2016 after a degenerative neurological condition left him in a \u201csemi-vegetative state.\u201d Evans\u2019 parents and the hospital\u2019s medical staff disagreed on the best way to treat Alfie, which resulted in an escalating legal battle:\n\nThe months-long legal battle between Alfie\u2019s parents and his doctors has drawn interventions from the pope and Italian authorities, who support the parents\u2019 desire to have their son treated at the Vatican\u2019s children\u2019s hospital. Doctors from Alder Hey Children\u2019s Hospital in Liverpool, where Alfie has been treated since December 2016, say he has little brain function and further treatment is futile. The toddler\u2019s life support was withdrawn Monday after a series of court rulings blocked further medical treatment. Alfie\u2019s father Tom Evans said Alfie continued to survive with no assistance, and that doctors had subsequently resumed providing oxygen and hydration. The family\u2019s lawyer claimed in court Tuesday that Alfie was doing \u201csignificantly better\u201d than previously believed. But the judge said \u201cthe sad truth\u201d is that Alfie\u2019s condition had not improved.\n\nAlthough the courts have been criticized for infringing on the parental rights in the case of Alfie Evans, the quote from Theresa May is pure fiction that was invented by the Babylon Bee, which is a well-known satire web site with a long history of publishing fictional stories.", "lang": "en"}
