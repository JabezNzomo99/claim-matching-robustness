There is no relationship between the policewoman and the old lady. Therefore, the claim that the old woman has worked so hard to secure the future of her granddaughter is also false.\n\nSocial media users are all praise for the old lady, assuming the claim to be true.\n\nA simple reverse search revealed the truth behind the photo. As per the media reports, the lady in police uniform is Manvi, a constable in Sant Kabir Nagar district in Uttar Pradesh. Manvi made the headlines by her act of humanity which she showed by helping an old hassled woman. This is nearly a five-month-old incident which was even praised by UP Police DGP OP Singh.\n\nThe DGP's letter says Manvi had gone to a bank where she met an old woman who was starving and struggling with her work. Manvi helped the elderly woman in completing her task at the bank and offered her food.\n\nIndia Today tried to contact Manvi but was unable to reach her. The response once received will be updated in the story.", "lang": "en"}
