This stop on his multi-state \"thank-you tour\" was mostly a campaign-style rally, but there was some policy, too.\n\nMidway into his remarks, Trump said:\n\n\"We\u2019re going to undertake one of the great tax reforms and simplifications in American history. This includes a massive tax cut for the middle-class and middle-class families from Wisconsin, too.\n\n\"We\u2019re also going to lower our business tax rate so that new companies will come to our shores and hire workers in cities like right here. Is that OK? That\u2019s what we want. We\u2019re going to bring our rates down from 35 percent, we\u2019re going to try to get it down to 15 percent. So, right now -- and by the way the jobs will pour in -- so, right now, we\u2019re the highest-taxed nation in the world. And when we finish, we\u2019ll be one of the lower taxed, one of the lower.\"\n\nWhether the president-elect keeps his promises on taxes will be something to be determined by PolitiFact National\u2019s Trump-O-Meter, which will be launched in 2017.\n\nBut we can answer now whether America\u2019s business tax rate is the highest in the world.\n\nThe corporate income tax rates in the United States range from 15 to 35 percent. And that 35 percent top rate -- at least as a \"statutory\" rate (more on that below) -- is relatively high.\n\nThe Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development publishes the top corporate tax rates for the 35 countries that belong to its organization, which includes most advanced, industrialized nations.\n\nThe U.S\u2019 top rate of 35 percent ranks first, just ahead of France, 34.4 percent; Belgium, 33 percent; and Australia and Mexico, 30 percent. On the low end: Switzerland, 8.5 percent; Ireland, 12.5 percent; Latvia and Canada, 15 percent; and Germany, 15.8 percent.\n\nSometimes references are made to a combined corporate tax rate, which includes federal and state corporate taxes; the U.S.\u2019 combined rate is 38.9 percent. But Trump was referring to the 35 percent federal rate, the one he vows to reduce.\n\nThere are, however, two clarifying points to make.\n\nOther nations, and what is paid\n\nTo back Trump\u2019s statement, his campaign cited a Forbes article that noted the United States has the highest corporate rate among industrialized nations. But Trump didn\u2019t limit his statement to industrialized nations.\n\nThe accounting firm PwC tracks the top federal corporate tax rates for 155 countries. That list shows five other countries that also have a top rate of 35 percent: Argentina, Chad, Congo, Malta and Zambia.\n\nAnd there are two countries with higher top corporate tax rates: United Arab Emirates, 55 percent; and Puerto Rico, 39 percent.\n\nIt also needs to be understood that America\u2019s 35 percent top rate is the statutory rate -- before deductions -- but U.S. companies aren\u2019t actually taxed at that rate. Tax deductions -- on health insurance, pensions and investment returns, for example -- allow corporations to reduce the pool of taxable profits.\n\nIndeed, a March 2016 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that in each year from 2006 to 2012, at least two-thirds of all active corporations had no federal income tax liability, although larger corporations were more likely to owe tax.\n\nAnd a May 2016 paper by Reed College economics professor Kimberly Clausing found U.S. multinational firms have used tax planning to generate effective tax rates \"that are far lower than the statutory rate, and often in the single digits.\"\n\n\n\nTrump said America\u2019s federal business tax rate is the highest \"in the world.\"\n\nThe top corporate tax in the United States is 35 percent, highest among the world\u2019s industrialized nations. But five smaller nations have the same rate and two smaller ones, United Arab Emirates and Puerto Rico, have rates above 35 percent.\n\nAlso, the 35 percent U.S. rate is only the starting point, given that corporations can use exemptions and deductions to effectively reduce that rate and pay lower taxes.\n\nFor a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
