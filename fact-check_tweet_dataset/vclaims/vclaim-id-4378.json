Keith Ellison tweeted that the Supreme Court \u201cratified Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018total and complete shutdown\u2019 of Muslims entry into the United States.\u201d That is a Trump quote from the presidential campaign. But his actual executive actions didn\u2019t go that far.\n\nTrump most recently issued a proclamation restricting certain nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and North Korea from obtaining visas to travel to the U.S. Certain Venezuelan government officials and their families were also barred.\n\nThe first five countries are majority Muslim nations, but that\u2019s far from banning all Muslims.\n\nIn fact, in January 2017, the Pew Research Center estimated that Trump\u2019s original executive order would affect only about 12 percent of Muslims in the world. That was when restrictions were also placed on Iraqi and Sudanese nationals, who have since been excluded.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court issued its ruling on a case challenging Trump\u2019s proclamation, Ellison reacted on Twitter.\n\nThe \u2018Total and Complete Shutdown\u2019 Quote\n\nTrump himself used the words \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d during the 2016 presidential campaign. He issued a \u201cStatement on Preventing Muslim Immigration,\u201d which he read at a Dec. 7, 2015, rally. Trump called for a \u201ccomplete shutdown \u2026 until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. We have no choice.\u201d\n\nEllison spoke about the \u201ctotal and complete\u201d shutdown quote in a Facebook interview with Minnesota\u2019s WCCO-TV on June 26. \u201cI know some people said, well it\u2019s not a Muslim ban because not all Muslim countries are banned, right?\u201d Ellison said (starting at the 1:45 mark). \u201cBut the countries that are banned, are banned because they\u2019re Muslim countries. And who better to judge than just relying on Trump\u2019s own words. Right out of the gate, he says he wants a total and complete ban on Muslim entry into the country.\u201d\n\nEllison said Trump then adjusted the language of the ban, but \u201cthat was always a facade, that was always a sham. This is a Muslim ban.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s quote was part of the plaintiffs\u2019 case in the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality and authority of Trump\u2019s proclamation. The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 on June 26 that the president had \u201clawfully exercised the broad discretion granted to him\u201d under the Immigration and Nationality Act to restrict entry to some foreign nationals in order to protect the interests of the United States.\n\nThe opinion, written by Chief Justice John Roberts, said the plaintiffs\u2019 case includes several statements by Trump and his campaign \u201ccasting doubt on the official objective of the Proclamation.\u201d But the majority found that the proclamation \u2014 issued in September as the third version of the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to restrict entry to the U.S. \u2014 \u201cis facially neutral toward religion.\u201d\n\nRoberts wrote: \u201cBut the issue before us is not whether to denounce the statements [of the president]. It is instead the significance of those statements in reviewing a Presidential directive, neutral on its face, addressing a matter within the core of executive responsibility.\u201d\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, in her dissent, said the proclamation was \u201cwindow dressing,\u201d and that the words of the president and his advisers showed discriminatory motives against Muslims. \u201cUltimately, what began as a policy explicitly \u2018calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u2019 has since morphed into a \u2018Proclamation\u2019 putatively based on national-security concerns,\u201d Sotomayor wrote. \u201cBut this new window dressing cannot conceal an unassailable fact: the words of the President and his advisers create the strong perception that the Proclamation is contaminated by impermissible discriminatory animus against Islam and its followers.\u201d\n\nThe proclamation \u2014 \u201cEnhancing Vetting Capabilities and Processes for Detecting Attempted Entry into the United States by Terrorists or other Public-Safety Threats\u201d \u2014 was issued on Sept. 24, 2017, after two previous executive orders on immigration in January and March of that year. The proclamation applies to certain nationals from the named countries who want to obtain a visa for travel to the U.S.\n\nThe restrictions have been tailored to each country for different security reasons, according to a White House explainer. They cover immigrants, who want to come to the U.S. permanently, and nonimmigrants, who only plan to visit temporarily.\n\n\n\nIran: Entry is suspended for Iranian nationals as immigrants and nonimmigrants, with the exception of individuals traveling on valid student and exchange visitor visas. Those temporary visitors will be subject to enhanced screening and vetting.\n\nLibya: Entry is suspended for Libyan nationals as immigrants, as well as nonimmigrants on business and tourist visas.\n\nSomalia: Entry is suspended for Somalian nationals as immigrants. Nonimmigrants traveling to the U.S. will be subjected to enhanced screening and vetting.\n\nSyria: Entry is suspended for Syrian nationals as immigrants and nonimmigrants.\n\nYemen: Entry is suspended for Yemeni nationals as immigrants and nonimmigrants traveling on business and tourist visas.\n\nNorth Korea: Entry is suspended for North Korean nationals as immigrants and nonimmigrants.\n\nVenezuela: Entry is suspended for certain Venezuelan government officials and their immediate family members traveling on business and tourist visas.\n\nTo be clear, not all foreign nationals from those countries are affected. The proclamation mentions exemptions for several individuals, including:\n\u2022 Any lawful permanent resident of the U.S.\n\u2022 Any person who has a valid document other than a visa granting admission to the U.S. \u2014 such as a boarding foil (for lost or stolen green cards) or an advance parole document (for those in the process of adjusting immigration status).\n\u2022 Any dual national from a restricted country who is traveling with a passport from a nonrestricted country\n\u2022 Any person granted asylum by the U.S., previously admitted as a refugee, or granted other forms of relief or protection\n\nThe proclamation also says that specified consular or border officials can grant waivers on a case-by-case basis, allowing affected foreign nationals to enter the U.S.\n\nWaivers may be granted if a person can show that denying entry would cause an undue hardship, or that entry would not pose a security risk, or would be in the national interest.\n\nWaivers may also be granted under some of the following circumstances:\n\u2022 The person has previously been admitted to the U.S.\n\u2022 The person seeks to enter the U.S. for significant business or professional obligations, and the denial of entry would impede those obligations.\n\u2022 The person is an infant, a young child, an adoptee, or someone needing urgent medical care, or dealing with other special circumstances.\n\u2022 The person has worked for the U.S. government, is traveling at the U.S. government\u2019s request, or is representing an international organization in a meeting with the U.S government.\n\nReaders can refer to the proclamation for further explanation of any additional exemptions or requirements for obtaining a waiver. The State Department also has prepared a document with responses to some frequently asked questions about the president\u2019s proclamation.\n\nCorrection, June 29: We originally referred to Trump\u2019s Dec. 7, 2015, event as a press conference. It was a campaign rally.", "lang": "en"}
