The claim is false; the graphic has been manipulated to include a fabricated quote, the Philippine broadcaster said; there is no public record of Robredo making the statement quoted in the posts.\n\nThe graphic was published here on Facebook on July 7, 2020. It has been shared more than 170 times.\n\nThe Tagalog-language text overlay in the graphic translates to English as: \"My policy is this / All affected should follow a 14-day quarantine period. If there's 2 of you at home that's a total of 28 days... / Leni Robredo / Vice President / March 12, 2020\".\n\nThe post\u2019s caption reads: \u201cNice fvp you are really brilliant\u201d.\n\n\u201cfvp\u201d is an acronym for \u201cfake vice president\u201d, a pejorative often used to describe Robredo after former senator Ferdinand Marcos filed a legal contest after his defeat to Robredo in the 2016 vice presidential elections.\n\nThe Philippine health department orders a 14-day home quarantine for all who \"exhibit fever or any symptom of lower respiratory illness, and has a history of travel to other countries with a confirmed case of COVID-19 but without any history of exposure\", according to guidelines published in late February 2020.\n\nPhilippine police have since been deployed to ensure people who test positive for the coronavirus and cannot self-isolate at home are taken to state-run quarantine centres, sparking warnings of potential rights violations, according to this AFP report.\n\nThe same graphic was also shared here, here and here on Facebook with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim, however, is false.\n\nIn response to the claim, News5\u2019s social media manager Agatha Sayurin told AFP via Facebook Messenger on July 16, 2020: \u201cThe quote card\u2026 is not ours.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur organisation\u2019s logo has been removed and it looks like it has been edited poorly given the grammatical errors and bad image quality.\u201d\n\nA combined reverse image and keyword search found the original graphic published here on News5\u2019s Facebook page on March 12, 2020.\n\nThe graphic quotes Robredo as saying, in Tagalog: \"Every bottle of alcohol that we hoard and don't use is one bottle that we deny our neighbors. In the end, if they get sick, all of us would be affected, no matter how much things or food we've hoarded. / Leni Robredo / Vice President / March 12, 2020\".\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the graphic in the misleading posts (L) and the genuine News5 graphic (R):\n\nThe quote in the original News5 graphic matches part of the transcript of Robredo\u2019s statement published here on the Liberal Party of the Philippines website, where she presides as chairperson. Her speech does not make reference to a 28-day home quarantine period.\n\nGuidelines published by Philippine health department in April 2020 for \u201cfamilies with member/s on home quarantine or self-isolation\u201d says: \u201cshould a household member develop symptoms late in the 14-day household isolation period, isolation period need not be extended but the person with new symptoms has to stay at home for 7 days\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
