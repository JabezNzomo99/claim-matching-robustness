Air can still go around the mask as well as through the pores in the material,\u201d while acting as a barrier to small virus particles.\n\nClaim: Masks cause toxins to be re-inhaled\n\nThe post also falsely claims that \u201ctoxins that we normally exhale as we breathe become trapped in the mask and re-inhaled.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t exhale toxins,\u201d said Jean-Luc Gala, Head of Clinic at Saint-Luc University in Brussels, Belgium. \u201cWe exhale carbon dioxide.\u201d\n\n\"The mask filters the virus, but not molecules. A virus is much larger than a molecule of oxygen or carbon dioxide,\" Gala explained.\n\nA similar claim, that \u201ccontaminants sit within mask fibers, get re-inhaled,\u201d was addressed in this AFP fact check.\n\nHyo-Jick Choi, assistant professor at the University of Alberta\u2019s Chemical and Materials Engineering Department, said via email that \u201cif the pathogen-carrying droplets (from large droplets to small aerosols) are produced by human activities such as sneezing, coughing, and speaking, then the virus-carrying droplets would have a composition similar to saliva.\n\n\u201cIn this case, pathogens on the mask surface may not be easily released from fibers because of the high viscosity of the contaminant.\u201d\n\nThis claim that masks shut down the wearer\u2019s immune system is based on the assumptions that wearing a mask \u201cdecreases oxygen intake\u201d and \u201cincreases carbon dioxide intake,\u201d both of which were shown to be false in this AFP fact check.\n\n\u201cHealthcare workers spend eight hours a day wearing a mask and do not develop secondary infections or health problems,\u201d Yves Coppieters, epidemiologist and public health professor at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles said.\n\nMask wearing \u201cencourages triggering & infection from dormant retro viruses, already in the body,\u201d claims another point in the post.\n\n\u201cThis is completely false,\u201d said Gala. \u201cFor example, we know that certain leukemias are triggered by retroviruses. However, we have never seen flare ups of the disease in patients after a transplant while they wear masks. It has never been an aggravating factor.\u201d\n\nAnd Dr. Shelley Payne, director of the LaMontagne Center for Infectious Disease at the University of Texas at Austin, said in an email that \u201cthere is no evidence that masks or gloves reduce the normal microbiota or predispose people to opportunistic infections.\u201d\n\nThe claim was also made in the widely shared \u201cPlandemic\u201d video, addressed in this AFP fact check.\n\nThe post claims that \u201cvirologists measure COVID-19 to be 80-49NM in size making the weave of material masks to be the equivalent of a chain link fence to a mosquito.\u201d\n\nBut COVID-19 is the name of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and the claim is also false if applied to the virus itself.\n\n\u201cSurgical masks have a filtering capacity for 90 percent for microorganisms, including (the virus). For FFP2 masks used in intensive care, this capacity increases to 98 percent, 99 percent. For fabric masks, it is lower, estimated to be between 50 percent and 70 percent,\u201d Coppieters said.\n\nThis is confirmed by guidelines set out by the Canadian government for the production of masks and respirators.\n\nClaim: Effectiveness of masks has not been studied\n\n\u201cNo peer-reviewed studies have been carried out of mask effectiveness within a social environment,\u201d says the final claim in the post. This is unfounded.\n\nGala said: \u201cThis is like saying you blame us for not studying the effectiveness of parachutes in a social environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know that parachutes will help you land unscathed, so we\u2019re not going to drop a person with a parachute and one without to compare the effectiveness! We\u2019re talking about a device which we know, empirically, is protective,\u201d he said.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published this study of two hair stylists in Missouri who had tested positive for COVID-19 and carried on working for several days while wearing face masks.\n\nThey came into contact with 139 clients, 67 of whom tested negative while the rest did not present symptoms. The CDC concluded that masks helped to mitigate the spread of the virus in a social setting.\n\nAFP Fact Check has debunked more than 560 examples of false or misleading information about the novel coronavirus.
