Yes, the claim is accurate, and here is some context: The Pledge of Allegiance was not on the original agenda at a local North Carolina elections board meeting, and Democrats voted against adding it to the docket for consideration. Later, when an audience member began reciting the pledge, the Democrats did not stand.\n\nThe claim originated from an article published by Bladen Online on January 15, 2020, titled \"Democrats vote out pledge and refuse to stand for flag\" (archived here). It opened:\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nAs the video of the meeting shows, one member at a Bladen County Board of Elections asked that the Pledge of Allegiance be added to the pre-approved meeting agenda. The three Democrats on the board did refuse to allow the pledge to be added to the meeting agenda for consideration.\n\nMembers of the audience addressed the board, noting their objections to the decision. When asked why she opposed adding the pledge, board chairwoman Louella Thompson said, \"That's my right, and I exercise it.\"\n\nThe audience members then began reciting an impromptu pledge, at which point the Democrats remained seated. Later in the meeting, Thompson threatened to call law enforcement and said the unplanned reciting of the pledge was a disruption to the meeting.\n\nAfter North Carolina Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper criticized the decision not to add the Pledge of Allegiance, Thompson reversed her decision. According to WECT-TV, Thompson said:\n\nThe Pledge of Allegiance was written in 1892 by Francis Bellamy, a socialist minister. In 1942, the U.S. Congress adopted the pledge, decreeing that people should recite it with their right hands over their hearts. In 1954, the words \"under God\" were added. Despite legal challenges over the years, the words remain in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nWe wrote about YouTube before.
