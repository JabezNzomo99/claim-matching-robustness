Even today, financial experts debate whether the financial crisis could have been averted had the government stepped in and arranged for an orderly sale to another investment firm, as it had six months earlier when Bear Stearns also teetered on the edge of collapse because of bad bets in the mortgage-backed securities market. Some argue that the government should have \u2014 and could have \u2014 saved Lehman and averted the cascading effect across Wall Street and the global economy.\n\nDuring the 2010 campaign, Kasich had bragged about having been a part of a team that took Google public in 2004. But the Dayton Daily News found Kasich overstated his own involvement and the company\u2019s role. Google had hired 28 investment firms to underwrite the initial public offering, and Lehman was the fifth underwriter. The company thus didn\u2019t play a significant role in Google\u2019s IPO, according to the article. But Kasich did know the founders of Google, and pitched Lehman as a second- or third-tier underwriter.\n\nKasich says he worked out of a two-man office in Columbus. He was a managing director \u2014 one of about 700 in a company of 25,000 \u2014 in the investment banking unit, not making risky mortgage investments or offering home loans. He never served on the board, as Trump once claimed during a GOP debate. (Kasich is not listed among the 51 highest paid Lehman employees in 2007.)\n\nKasich\u2019s role as managing director was unique, unlike the others who shared his title. He had no direct experience in investment banking but brought government experience, regulatory perspective, connections and a go-getter attitude, said Weinstein, now retired in Connecticut. Kasich advised companies on various deals and strategic initiatives, like mergers and acquisitions and public offerings.\n\n\u201cThey have a real responsibility. They need to make sure the passengers get where they\u2019re going,\u201d Weinstein said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t have anything to do with the financials of the company, the future of the company, the hiring or firing, anything like that. To say that you were a pilot who flew the route from Boston to LaGuardia on Trump Airlines, and when Trump went under, you should bear that responsibility \u2014 a layman would say, what are you talking about?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting two other claims made in the ad: \u201cKasich gave Ohio ObamaCare and increased our budget more than any other governor in the U.S.\u201d This is similar to a new ad by Conservative Solutions PAC, a pro-Marco Rubio super PAC. (We fact-checked the two claims when a pro-Jeb Bush super PAC made them, and have written about Kasich\u2019s economic record as governor.)\n\nThere has been a net tax cut of $5 billion under Kasich, according to state budget officials. The left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities found that Ohio ranks among the top five states with the biggest income-tax cuts, as a share of the state\u2019s economy. But as we\u2019ve warned before, it\u2019s difficult to compare one state\u2019s total tax cuts to another because states have varying budget cycles and types of tax revenue.\n\nKasich received a D in the libertarian Cato Institute\u2019s 2014 Fiscal Policy Report Card, but was praised for his income-tax cuts and the tax reform legislative packages he signed into law. Kasich raised some sales taxes in the state but his income-tax cuts resulted in a net tax decrease in the most recent state budget. His score was dragged down by his spending increases and his decision to expand Medicaid, the report card said.\n\nKasich worked at Lehman Brothers, but that\u2019s about all Trump\u2019s campaign gets accurate in this ad about his association with the firm. Kasich had no banking experience prior to getting hired by the firm, and he largely played a facilitator role as managing director. He gave strategic financial advice to other companies and generated business by using his contacts in various sectors \u2013 not making risky mortgage investments.", "lang": "en"}
