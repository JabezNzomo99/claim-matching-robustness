But how does it matter, you carry on with your Hindu-Muslim -translated)\u201d was posted by a Facebook user Chandan Pratihast on June 25, 2018. The post has been shared more than 19000 times and \u2018liked\u2019 more than 2500 times so far. The image shared by the account describes the women in the photo flanking Subramanian Swamy as her daughter and granddaughter. The post calls out the supposed hypocrisy of Swamy who has often taken a hardline position on sensitive issues.\n\nIt has also been shared on Facebook and Twitter. Moreover, the post from a page named Aam Admi Zindabad(\u0906\u092e \u0906\u0926\u092e\u0940 \u091c\u093f\u0902\u0926\u093e\u092c\u093e\u0926) has been shared more than 3900 times.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nDoing a reverse image search on Google throws up a list of tweets, out of which Jagdish Shetty\u2019s tweet on May 4, 2018, was the one of the earliest on social media platforms.\n\nTo find out more about the photograph, Alt News contacted Shetty who said, \u201cI had clicked the picture myself. These are the women who wanted a picture with Subramanian Swamy when he was rushing at the airport.\u201d The women in the photograph are NOT his daughter and granddaughter as claimed.\n\nSubramanian Swamy was indeed present in Bengaluru on May 4, 2018, for a Times Now debate during the Karnataka Assembly election.\n\nPolitical leaders are popular targets for mischief mongers on social media who often resort to distortion and misrepresentation of the surrounding narrative. Swamy is simply the latest victim of this tendency.", "lang": "en"}
