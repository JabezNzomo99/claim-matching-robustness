Yesterday's forecast predicts that it will.\n\nA few things have changed since December, but the main driver of this apparent success is the government's decision to sell \u00a320 billion worth of assets in 2015-16.\n\nThis means selling things like some of the government's shares in Lloyds Banking Group.\n\nBut the OBR makes clear: \"Financial asset sales bring forward cash that would otherwise have been received in the future in the shape of mortgage repayments and dividends, so they only temporarily reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio. In broad terms, they leave the public sector's net worth unchanged.\"\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies agrees, saying this is \"not a genuine reduction in government indebtedness\".\n\nThe debt is forecast to fall anyway from 2016/17, but the Chancellor's announcement isn't as exciting as it might seem.", "lang": "en"}
