In the video, several officers stand around the vehicle, which already appears to be damaged, and one jumps onto its hood to prod at the broken windshield with a baton.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll probably blame it on the protesters. They\u2019re beating up their own car, as we speak, right now,\u201d a person off-screen can be heard saying in the video. \u201cThe cops are beating up their own car and they\u2019re gonna blame it on the protesters.\u201d\n\nThat is not an accurate description of events, however. Boston Police Sgt. John Boyle told local ABC affiliate WCVB that the videotaped officers removed broken glass from the windshield so that they could drive the already-damaged vehicle away from the scene.\n\n\u201cThe officer wasn\u2019t able to drive it safely because they could not see out of the window. Their vision was impaired,\u201d Boyle told WCVB. \u201cThe decision was made to remove a portion of the windshield so the officer could remove the vehicle without striking anybody.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller found a video on Twitter that shows civilians caused significant damage to the vehicle prior to the police clearing broken glass from its windshield. That video, which has the same buildings in the background as the Facebook video, depicts rioters jumping on its hood and breaking the windshield.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the real video of what happened to that police car,\u201d reads the tweet. \u201cThere\u2019s videos out there showing that the cops staged the damaged to their own car.\u201d\n\nWCVB also reported that the Facebook video ends before showing the police drive the vehicle away from the area. As of June 1, 21 police cruisers sustained damage during protests in response to Floyd\u2019s death, the Boston Police Department tweeted.", "lang": "en"}
