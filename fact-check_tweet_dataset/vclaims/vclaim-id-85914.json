Many have debunked the claim that a causal relationship exists between sex trafficking in the host city and the Super Bowl. Cornyn and Klobuchar do not claim a causal relationship, but still describe the Super Bowl as having \u201cone of the highest levels of human sex trafficking activity of any event in the country,\u201d and having \u201cbecome one of the largest venues for sex trafficking in the country.\u201d\n\nBut, beyond the lawmakers\u2019s basic failure to use a calculator properly, there was no basis for comparison in the study. How did the particular days in those three weeks compare to similar days in the three weeks leading up to the 2010 Super Bowl in Miami? How many ads were there during the same three weeks in a non-Super Bowl year in Dallas? How do the three weeks compare to other three-week periods during the rest of the year? How many ads were actually placed by law enforcement in an effort to arrest potential clients of prostitutes?\n\nResearchers reviewed thousands of commercial sex ads during the week before the 2014 Super Bowl in areas near the stadium and in the Phoenix metropolitan area in Arizona to establish a basis for the 2015 Super Bowl. Out of 987 ads reviewed in the New York/New Jersey area, 97 percent indicated prostitution and 84 percent indicated possible sex trafficking. Five percent of the ads were flagged as potential minors. Of the 1,345 ads screened in Phoenix, 95 percent identified as prostitution and 80 percent were flagged as potential trafficking. Three percent of the Phoenix ads were possible minors.\n\nThe number of sex trafficking arrests in host cities leading up to and during the game are not in those high figures. In Dallas in 2011, 59 people were arrested on prostitution-related charges; 13 of them were visitors for the game and none involved juveniles. (This report cites there were 105 arrests metrowide, two involving human trafficking.) In Indianapolis in 2012, there were 68 commercial sex arrests and at least two trafficking victims identified. In New Orleans in 2013, at least two men were booked on charges of sex trafficking and five women were rescued (one was 17 years old). In New York in 2014, 45 were arrested in a prostitution bust and 16 minors were rescued.\n\n\u201cI would point out that his statement specifically cited the Super Bowl as \u2018one of the highest,\u2019 not the highest. Second, he did not say it was unique to the Super Bowl; nothing in his statement precludes other major sporting events from also being at or near the top \u2013 in fact it indicates an acknowledgement that other major sporting events also see elevated activity. Third, he did not say there was a direct, causal relationship \u2013 only that the level of activity around the event was one of the highest \u2013 again indicating that other major sporting events may also be at or near the top.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Super Bowl is one example of any major convention or sporting event where you see an increase in ads and other criminal activities related to sex trafficking,\u201d said Brigit Helgen, a spokeswoman for Klobuchar. \u201cThat\u2019s why Senator Klobuchar has worked with Senator Cornyn and Cindy McCain to strengthen state anti-trafficking laws and make sure that law enforcement have the tools they need to fight sex trafficking at these big events and every day of the year.\u201d\n\nSex trafficking takes place during the Super Bowl, as it does all year and around other events that traffickers seek to exploit. But new research shows there is little evidence to support claims that record levels of activity exist during Super Bowl week. Arrest or rescue numbers in recent years do not confirm that there are hundreds or thousands of women and girls being exploited.\n\nThere is a dearth of reliable data on this topic, making it difficult to cite a hard figure. But it is the speaker\u2019s responsibility to check out the methodology of a study \u2014 in this case, Traffick911\u2019s count of ads on a Web site for a few days in a three-week period \u2014 before citing it. And when there is new research that negates the earlier figure, the onus is on the speaker to correct a news release or a news conference script.", "lang": "en"}
