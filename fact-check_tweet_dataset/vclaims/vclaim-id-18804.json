It actually comes from best-selling author Taylor Caldwell\u2019s novel about ancient Rome.\n\nSocial media users will often share historical quotes to make points about politics, though some of the quotes they use are not, in fact, genuine. This quote is attributed to Cicero, an orator and politician from the later years of the Roman republic.

It does not appear in any of his surviving works from that year or any other.\n\n\u201cThe quote is not by Cicero but from a novel,\u201d Boston University classics professor Dr. Ann Carol Vasaly told the Daily Caller via email.\n\nIndeed, the website Quote Investigator traced the origin of the quote to Caldwell\u2019s \u201cA Pillar of Iron,\u201d a historical novel based on Cicero\u2019s life. It appears in a passage summarizing the views of her fictional Cicero character, though the actual Cicero may have agreed with the sentiment.\n\nAlthough Caldwell can be credited with penning the quote, it was only a year later that others erroneously attributed the quote to Cicero. In 1966, Louisiana Rep. Otto Passman cited Cicero as the author of the statement during an address of Congress.\n\nSeveral institutions, including the Congressional Research Service and University of Texas at Austin, have since called the quote \u201cspurious.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
