Some reported burning their Nike products in disapproval.\n\nOthers applauded the company for putting a spotlight on Kaepernick, the one-time San Francisco 49ers quarterback who began kneeling on the sidelines during the anthem in 2016 to speak out against social injustice. The ad is part of the 30th anniversary of Nike\u2019s \u201cJust Do It\u201d campaign; the company will also reportedly sell new Kaepernick apparel.\n\n\n\nBut only in a fictional account did Nike end its deal with Kaepernick.\n\nA false story making that claim was posted Sept. 3 on conservativecolumns.com after Kaepernick posted the ad on social media. The report claimed that a recording of \u201canti-white\u201d remarks made by Kaepernick had been sent to Nike officials.\n\n\u201cKaepernick lost the endorsement almost as soon as he got it when his anti-white attacks got him in trouble with Nike leadership,\u201d the story says.\n\nIn reality, the story was first published by America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, an online publication that claims its work is satire and that has used a number of websites to post its content.\n\nThere are hints of satirical intent.\n\n\n\nThe original post was published on the Last Line of Defense website \u201cworstpot.us/ever,\u201d and the story\u2019s URL includes the statement: \u201cjust-admit-you-hate-his-skin-color.\u201d The story also references \u201cNike president Charles Bartowski,\u201d which was the name of the central character on the NBC show \u201cChuck.\u201d (Nike\u2019s president, chairman and CEO is Mark Parker.)\n\nBut the story\u2019s headline and opening paragraphs stand to mislead those who don\u2019t read the full piece critically. While the Last Line of Defense website includes a disclaimer and a satire label, the version that was posted on conservativecolumns.com is not identified as such.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories shared on the social media network.", "lang": "en"}
