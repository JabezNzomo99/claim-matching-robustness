It later goes on to recommend that a future Labour government introduce a \u201cprogressive property tax based on contemporary property values\u2026payable by owners, not tenants\u201d to replace council tax. It doesn\u2019t specifically mention stopping a single occupancy discount.\n\nBut none of these recommendations are repeated in Labour\u2019s manifesto (which we checked recently here) or their costings document. The latter does mention council tax, but only in the context of introducing a second homes tax.", "lang": "en"}
