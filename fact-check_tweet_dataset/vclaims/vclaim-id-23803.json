China responded with tariffs on $110 billion of U.S. goods.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin traveled to Beijing last week for the latest round of trade talks, and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is expected in Washington this week.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Lighthizer and I just concluded productive meetings with China\u2019s Vice Premier Liu He. We will continue our talks in Washington, D.C. next week,\u201d Mnuchin tweeted on May 1.\n\nTwo days later, at a bilateral meeting with the prime minister of the Slovak Republic, Trump spoke about the status of the ongoing trade talks with China.\n\nThe president distorts the facts about tariffs \u2014 again. As we have written before, tariffs are paid by U.S. importers in the form of customs duties, and to some extent by U.S. consumers in the form of higher prices. They are not paid by China. In an interview that aired May 7 on NPR, former White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said: \u201cFor every dollar of tariff that\u2019s collected, it\u2019s coming out of disposable income of the United States consumer today.\u201d\n\nThis time, the president compounded his false claim by stating that the U.S. has \u201cnever taken in 10 cents from China, and now we\u2019re taking in billions and billions of dollars.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the U.S. has collected billions in tariffs on Chinese imports for years. Below is a chart we created from the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb, which uses data from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nAs the chart shows, tariff revenue has increased substantially as a result of the increased tariffs on Chinese imports \u2014 up 70 percent in 2018 over the previous calendar year. But revenue was already in the billions before Trump took office \u2014 contrary to the president\u2019s claim.\n\nTrump also claimed that the increased tariffs he has imposed on China have \u201chad a very positive effect on things.\u201d It is true that the increase has raised more in revenue, as we\u2019ve shown. However, China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural and food products threaten to reduce the U.S. agricultural trade surplus in fiscal year 2019 to the lowest level since 2007, partly because of \u201csignificant declines in projected exports to China,\u201d according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Economic Research Service.\n\nChina has placed tariffs on more than 800 U.S. products, \u201cincluding soybeans, pork, dairy products, fruits and nuts, seafood, and processed products,\u201d according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.\n\n\u201cChina has fallen from the leading export market for U.S. agricultural products in FY2017 to the third-leading export market in FY2018 due to the retaliatory tariffs, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). USDA forecasts that China will fall to the fifth-leading market for those products in FY2019,\u201d CRS said in a Dec. 31, 2018, report.\n\nThe report goes on to say: \u201cIn November 2018, USDA forecast that U.S. agricultural and food exports to China would decline to $9 billion in FY2019 from $16.3 billion in FY2018 and $21.8 billion in FY2017, citing reduced exports due to the \u2018trade tensions\u2019 between the United States and China.\u201d\n\nTrump has expressed concern in recent days about the pace of negotiations with China. On May 5, Trump threatened to impose more tariffs on China, complaining that the trade talks have moved \u201ctoo slowly.\u201d\n\nA day later, Trump falsely tweeted: \u201cWith China we lose 500 Billion Dollars.\u201d Trump commonly distorts the facts about trade deficits. In fact, the U.S. had a total trade deficit with China in goods and services of nearly $379 billion in 2018. The U.S. had a deficit in goods of about $419 billion with China, but that was offset by a $40.5 billion trade surplus in services.\n\nIn his remarks on May 3, the president also said this about the European Union: \u201cWe\u2019re losing $181 billion a year. We have been for many years.\u201d The U.S. had a $110 billion total deficit in goods and services with the EU in 2018, up 20 percent since Trump took office. The U.S. deficit in goods was $170 billion, but the U.S. had a $60 billion surplus in services.", "lang": "en"}
