This claim is false; the photo has been doctored from an original showing him in a plain black T-shirt.\n\nThis Facebook post, published on February 26, 2019, and since shared around 2,500 times, contains a photo showing Widodo's son Kaesang Pangarep sitting next to his older brother Gibran Rakabuming.\n\nPangarep appears to be wearing a black T-shirt with a gold design on the left-hand side depicting a communist hammer-and-sickle.\n\nThe post's caption says: \"I\u2019m sorry, I just want to ask: whose son is he??? How dare he wear a shirt with a PKI symbol?\"\n\nPKI refers to Indonesia's communist party, which was banned in 1965 after it was blamed for a failed coup. Here is an AFP article from 2017 about anti-communist purges that followed that event.\n\nHere is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nA reverse image search found that the image in the Facebook post had been doctored from an original photo used in this report published by online news site detik.com on January 10, 2019.\n\nIn the original photo, Pangarep is wearing a plain black T-shirt with no hammer-and-sickle design.\n\nThe headline of the detik.com article, translated into English, says: \"When Jokowi's sons join the conversation about Nurhadi-Aldo\".\n\nJokowi is a nickname for Widodo and the report was on social media comments made by his sons over a controversy in Indonesia about upcoming elections.\n\nThe photo was attributed to the site and its reporter called Dyah Paramita Saraswati.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Detik.com report:\n\nWidodo is running for a second term in Indonesian elections to be held in April. Here is a recent AFP report related to next month's polls.\n\nThe president has been subject to multiple allegations that he has links to Indonesia's defunct communist party. He has repeatedly rejected the claims.\n\nHere is a fact-check previously carried out by AFP on a doctored picture purporting to show the president attending a PKI event.", "lang": "en"}
