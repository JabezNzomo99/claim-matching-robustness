Are U.S. women\u2019s soccer players really earning less than men?\n\nThe lawsuit from the women\u2019s team sketched out the following scenario: If both teams played 20 friendlies in a year, a top-tier women\u2019s national team player would earn $164,320 less, or \u201c38% of the compensation of a similarly situated MNT player.\u201d That was true under the previous collective-bargaining agreement that ended in December 2016. The Fact Checker obtained the new agreement, which took effect in April 2017. Using the same 20-game scenario, we calculated that the player on the women\u2019s team would earn $28,333 less, or about 89 percent of the compensation of a similarly situated men\u2019s team player. If both teams lost all 20 games, the players would make the same amount. That\u2019s because the men earn a $5,000 bonus when they lose and the women have a $100,000 base salary.\n\n2. Schiff\u2019s false claim his committee had not spoken to the whistleblower\n\n3. \u2018Some people did something\u2019: The full context for Rep. Omar\u2019s remarks\n\nHer remarks were part of a larger point about anti-Muslim discrimination and came after she listed some examples. A longer look at what she said: \u201cFor far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen, and, frankly, I\u2019m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it. CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.\u201d We leave it for readers to decide whether Omar was clear enough on terrorism.\n\n4. Does the Walton family earn more in a minute than Walmart workers do in a year?\n\n5. Eric Trump\u2019s Four-Pinocchio claim that the Obamacare website cost more than Trump\u2019s border barrier\n\n7. What happened in the White House between Democrats and Trump?\n\n9. What\u2019s actually in the Green New Deal?\n\nBut the size of a refund tells you nothing about a person\u2019s tax bill. We gave Four Pinocchios to Harris because she linked these facts deceptively and without context, making it appear as though the smaller tax refunds were evidence of a tax hike on the middle class. In reality, the size of a tax refund reflects nothing about the size of a tax cut or tax increase \u2014 and at least in 2018, the vast majority of middle-class Americans can expect to pay less in taxes as a result of the Trump tax law. Moreover, Harris jumped to a faulty conclusion based on preliminary data. In the end, tax refunds in 2018 were little different from in 2017.\n\nTop five columns in 2019 \u2014 that were published before 2019", "lang": "en"}
