Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) referenced texts between FBI agent Peter Strzok and attorney Lisa Page, but she assumes the worst possible interpretation.", "author": "www.washingtonpost.com", "date": "2019-05-30T07:00:49.324Z", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-37000", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/05/30/fbi-texts-evidence-treason-coup/?utm_term=.3f56d7a7e6a7", "vclaim": "Peter Strzok was an FBI agent and Lisa Page was an FBI attorney in 2016. They were also carrying on an affair and exchanged thousands of texts. Those texts have now emerged as a central talking point for President Trump and his Republican allies to claim the investigation into ties between his campaign and Russia was a secret \u201ccoup\u201d to thwart his election. Some of the texts reflect a deep animus toward Trump and the way he conducted himself during the 2016 campaign.\n\nStrzok told the inspector general that \u201che did not specifically recall sending it [the text], but that he believed that it was intended to reassure Page that Trump would not be elected, not to suggest that he would do something to impact the investigation.\u201d He added that \u201chad he \u2014 or the FBI in general \u2014 actually wanted to prevent Trump from being elected, they would not have maintained the confidentiality of the investigation into alleged collusion between Russia and members of the Trump campaign in the months before the election.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe found that Strzok was not the sole decision maker for any of the specific investigative decisions\u201d in the case and that \u201cwe further found evidence that in some instances Strzok and Page advocated for more aggressive investigative measures than did others\u201d on the Clinton team. In regard to the Clinton case, \u201cour review did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that these political views directly affected the specific investigative decisions,\u201d the inspector general said. (Whether the creation of the Russia probe was affected by political views is still being investigated by the inspector general.)\n\nPage, in her closed-door interview with lawmakers, said she did not remember this meeting. But she remembers a continuing discussion about how fast to go. She said it was her view that \u201cwe don\u2019t need to go at total breakneck speed because so long as he doesn\u2019t become president, there isn\u2019t the same threat to national security.\u201d The FBI would still investigate the case, but it was not as urgent.\n\nStrzok agreed with Page\u2019s recollection. \u201cThere was one school of thought, of which Lisa was a member,\u201d Strzok testified, \u201csaying the polls, everybody in America is saying Secretary Clinton is the prohibitive favorite to be the next President, and therefore, based on that, these allegations about the Trump campaign, we don\u2019t need to risk that source. We can just take our time. We can run a traditional years-long counterintelligence operation, and we don\u2019t really need to worry because he\u2019s not going to be elected.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that the IG did not find evidence that Strzok\u2019s texts biased the investigation does not mean that it did not bias the investigation,\u201d a Cheney aide said. \u201cThese inquiries are largely about judgment calls made on the part of the people running them, and what the individuals they are investigating claim those messages mean in the aftermath. . . . When you have law enforcement officials who are at the helm of critical investigations like this saying those things, it raises questions about their motives and conduct.\u201d\n\nThe language in the texts is certainly disturbing, especially the Aug. 8 exchange. But that is mitigated by the fact that there is no evidence FBI officials actually tried to derail Trump\u2019s election. If anything, the FBI\u2019s actions helped ensure it. The \u201cinsurance policy\u201d text is more explainable, reflecting a debate within the FBI about how aggressively to pursue the investigation. (Strzok appears to have lost that debate, as the probe did not really pick up speed until after the election.)", "lang": "en"}
