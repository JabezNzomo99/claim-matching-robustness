The language in the final bill did not include the exemptions that many advocates had hoped for, providing religious exemptions for federal laws that religious groups did not agree with.\n\nThe White House did not respond to our request for clarification, but Trump likely was referring to a 2011 controversy at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Many politicians and groups have mischaracterized this incident since then. (Our colleague Dan Lamothe of Checkpoint summarized the controversy and ensuing mischaracterizations here.)\n\nRep. Steve King (R-Iowa) spoke out against the policy on the House floor on Dec. 2, 2011: \u201cThey\u2019ve given their all for America, and they\u2019ve defended and taken an oath to the Constitution, and here they are. The people that come to visit them can\u2019t bring a religious artifact? They can\u2019t bring a Bible? They can\u2019t use them in the services? A priest can\u2019t walk in with the Eucharist and offer communion to a patient who might be on their deathbed because it\u2019s prohibited in this memo.\u201d\n\nWithin days, Walter Reed apologized and announced it was rescinding and rewriting the visitor guidelines. The hospital said the policy was written by a small group of officials and was not thoroughly reviewed. \u201cIf the family, if friends, wanted to bring things in, it was fine,\u201d hospital spokeswoman Sandy Dean was quoted in a Dec. 7, 2011, Gannett News Service article. \u201cThe way the policy was written was incorrect. We are rewriting the policy.\u201d\n\nThe hospital said the restriction on religious items was not enforced, but it was written to protect patients from unwanted proselytizers after patients and families complained of religious groups aggressively approaching them in inpatient wards. Patients declare their religious preferences when they arrive to the hospital, and the guideline was intended to protect their religious preferences, according to the hospital.\n\n\u201cIn 2011, there was a misinterpretation of our visitation policy, and we\u2019ve since corrected that policy. It was too ambiguous, so it was rewritten to ensure that everyone was aware that Bibles and other religious materials have always been, and will remain, available for patient use at Walter Reed National Medical Center,\u201d Dean told The Fact Checker.\n\nAfter King spoke on the House floor, he and Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) met with Walter Reed senior leadership about the policy. On Dec. 7, 2011, the lawmakers announced that the \u201cDefense Department appears to have acted in good faith by retracting the original statement and releasing a statement of regret.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 24, 2012, about a month and half after King criticized the policy, Walter Reed issued a memo that canceled the earlier instructions and removed the restriction on religious items, Snopes.com found. Four months after that, the hospital issued an information paper further clarifying what happened: \u201cFamily members have been and will always be allowed to bring religious materials and texts,\u201d read the paper, obtained by Snopes.\n\nFamily Research Council Executive Vice President Jerry Boykin said his group was glad to see the policy quickly revised, and said the original policy was so poorly written that he doubted senior leadership knew it existed until the group brought it to King\u2019s attention: \u201cIt was so obviously foolish and such a usurpation of the individual freedoms of the men and women that have served the country, that I question whether it was ever reviewed by the senior leaders of Walter Reed. I\u2019d be surprised if it was.\u201d\n\nBut this description lacks quite a bit of context. Once lawmakers caught wind of this policy and criticized it in December 2011, Walter Reed announced within five days that it was rescinding and revising it. The hospital clarified that the policy was not thoroughly reviewed, broadly worded and was never intended to limit family members and other visitors from bringing religious items for service members at the hospital.", "lang": "en"}
