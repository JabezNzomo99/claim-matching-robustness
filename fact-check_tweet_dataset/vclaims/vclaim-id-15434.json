Not only had Friedrich, now too old to be drafted, not done his military service, but he had become a U.S. citizen, Blair explained to PolitiFact.\n\nWell, on April 2, 2019, (which happens to be International Fact-Checking Day), in making remarks to reporters about Germany, referred to his father, Fred, and said:\n\n\"My father is German, right? Was German, and born in a very wonderful place in Germany.\"\n\nA flurry of news reports quickly declared that the president had uttered a falsehood about his father\u2019s birthplace \u2014 again. The stories pointed out that, as has been reported many times, Fred Trump was born in New York. Just as his New York Times obituary says he was.\n\nAs for the president\u2019s claim about his father, when PolitiFact inquired to the White House, a spokesman did not respond.\n\nBlair, speaking to PolitiFact from New York\u2019s Central Park, said there\u2019s no doubt that Elizabeth Trump was pregnant with Fred while she and Friedrich were still in Germany.\n\nBut there is also no question, Blair attested, that the couple had returned to New York by the time Fred was born.\n\n\"As we know, that does not make him born in Germany,\" Blair said. \"Conceived in Germany? OK. But, born in Germany, no.\"\n\nNewsweek and The Independent reported that Trump has made the erroneous claim about his father at least four times since taking office.\n\nEach time, according to Newsweek, he has been either criticizing Germany's contribution to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) or the European Union's trade relationship with the U.S.\n\nDonald Trump said his father was born in Germany \u2014 even though, as has been reported many times -- Fred Trump was born in New York.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why the president keeps repeating it, but it\u2019s wrong.", "lang": "en"}
