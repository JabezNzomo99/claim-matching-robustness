Democrats say the committee\u2019s investigation is designed to harm former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton. But Republicans, as shown in the statements above, argue that they have uncovered new witnesses and developed promising new threads of inquiry into the tragedy.\n\nFirst, Amanda Duvall, a spokeswoman for the committee, acknowledged that the claim in the 13-page letter to Cummings that the committee has interviewed 50 never-before-interviewed witnesses was incorrect. She attributed the problem to a \u201cstaff error.\u201d After our inquiry, the committee staff uploaded a corrected version of the letter.\n\nDuvall noted that the number was stated correctly in a USA Today opinion article that appeared under Gowdy\u2019s name on Oct. 7. That article stated: \u201cThis committee has interviewed 41 witnesses no other committee interviewed.\u201d (In other words, the committee is not counting any interviews conducted by the ARB in its list.) She said more witnesses have been interviewed since then.\n\nWhy would the ARB interviews not be counted? \u201cOur metric is congressional committees,\u201d Duvall said. \u201cThe ARB is an internal, executive branch, process, narrow in scope and not independent. The interviews were not transcribed, many were short and conducted in a group setting.\u201d\n\nExcluding the ARB makes a difference in the counting of interviews, as 16 of the people who have been interviewed were previously interviewed by the ARB. That would shrink the number of new interviews to 30. (Seven of the 53 people were interviewed previously by other congressional committees.)\n\nBut Gowdy, in his MSNBC interview, specifically mentioned the ARB: \u201cSo when I hear this mantra about seven or eight previous congressional investigations and ARB, it makes me wonder how did you miss these seven eyewitnesses.\u201d\n\nBut Duvall indicated this was also a misstatement. \u201cWe have talked to three eyewitnesses no one has interviewed,\u201d on Sept. 22, June 4 and June 19, she said. \u201cThese are part of the seven eyewitnesses no congressional committee has interviewed.\u201d (Four other eyewitnesses were interviewed by the ARB, and three others were interviewed by the House Intelligence Committee.)\n\nSo, in effect, there were 10 eyewitnesses, most of whom have been previously interviewed either by a House Committee or the ARB. Two of the new eyewitnesses come from the intelligence community and one from the Defense Department.\n\nDuvall added: \u201cI would ask you to fact check this: Democrats have asked for zero documents and zero witnesses.\u201d (Update: Paul Bell, spokesman for the minority staff, disputed this dig. He provided copies of letters seeking documents and requesting interviews. \u201cWe have never claimed we made anywhere near the number of requests the Republicans have, mainly because we think they have strayed from the original purpose of the Committee, but this shows their statement is incorrect,\u201d he said.)\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the interviews of the the 30 people who had not been interviewed by either a House committee or the ARB, as of Oct. 9. The majority appear to be State Department employees, many in media relations.\n\nThe numbers game is important to Republicans because they use the figure to justify how the Select Committee is necessary and breaking new ground. But there is a bit less here than meets the eye, especially if the interviews already conducted by the ARB are included.\n\nStill, there\u2019s nothing wrong with saying that the committee has conducted 30 new interviews \u2014 and found three new eyewitnesses. Or, more precisely, the committee could say it has interviewed a total of 53 people, including 30 who have not been interviewed previously and 10 who were in Benghazi on the night of the attacks.\n\nWe appreciate the fact that the committee released a corrected version of the letter. And we understand that Gowdy was speaking on live television and perhaps did not mean to mention the ARB, preferring to keep the focus on interviews conducted by Congress. But there\u2019s little reason to hype the numbers and better to remain as precise as possible.", "lang": "en"}
