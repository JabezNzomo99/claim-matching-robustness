The post was flagged multiple times as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to curb misinformation.\n\nThe photo\u2019s low definition, blurred edges and over imposed text are all indicators this image has been manipulated.\n\nIndeed, the harmfully edited picture comes from a Reuters photograph showing Obama and his two daughters, Sasha and Malia in 2007. The photograph, taken by Bryan Snyder and visible here, shows the then-Senator on the campaign trail in New Hampshire. The image in the claims was clearly altered in a false and harmful way.\n\nThe original photograph\u2019s caption reads: \u201cDemocratic presidential candidate U.S. Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) (top R) and his family, wife Michelle (rear), daughters Malia (L) and Sasha, look at Laylah the dog outside the Brick Store in Bath, New Hampshire May 28, 2007.
