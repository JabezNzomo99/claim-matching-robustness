We are always at the end of the year, we report underperformance of the revenue by about KSh100 billion or even more,\" he\n\nTreasury would thus adjust its revenue estimates to a more \u201crealistic figure\u201d, Yatani said, and trim the budget.\n\nThe country\u2019s financial year runs from 1 July to 30 June. Was the minister correct about the pattern over the last 10 years, suggesting the pandemic will extend the financial pain for Kenyans? We checked.\n\nYatani told Africa Check that while appropriation-in-aid had generally done well, ordinary revenue was more \u201csluggish\u201d.\n\nusually refers to the money collected by government ministries.

Ordinary revenue includes\n\nYatani gave two reasons why revenue collection had underperformed. \u201cI think\n\nthere\u2019s overestimation of revenue and then there\u2019s also challenges with the enforcement. So the target and what are realised are usually not on par.\u201d\n\nThe minister also said that certain relief efforts missed their target. \u201cSometimes we give concessions in terms of tax exemptions and the benefits are not passed on to the intended beneficiaries.\u201d\n\nGovt undershot targets nine years out of 10\n\nGovernment revenue targets \u201cchange a lot\u201d in the course of a financial year, John Kinuthia, a\n\nThe \u201cprinted estimates\u201d or \u201cbudget\u201d column in treasury documents show the original ordinary revenue target at the beginning of the year, Kinuthia said.\n\n\u201cThat tells you, this is where we started. From a budget credibility perspective, you look at what was approved at the beginning of the year versus the actual performance at the end of the year.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cprinted estimates target\u201d is also the\n\nBased on the data, Kenya underperformed on its ordinary revenue targets for at least nine of the ten years from 2009/2010 to 2018/2019. The outlier is 2010/11, for which there are two sets of figures, where the country\n\nThe minister is correct in terms of a consistent underperforming of ordinary revenue. (\n\n, a tax consultant in Nairobi, agreed the country has struggled to meet its revenue targets. \u201cOut of the last ten years, I can't remember the last time we exceeded the target,\u201d he told Africa Check.\n\nHira said that revenue collected was barely keeping pace with the government\u2019s recurring bills, including debt repayment.\n\n\u201cSo the question is, why can't we meet our targets? One obvious answer is the targets are just unrealistic. And I think that comes from the fact that the government tends to say this is what we want to spend, so this is the amount we have to collect.\n\n\u201cThe reality is if you think of your own home, you bring in an income and you think this is the money I\u2018ve got and this is the amount I can spend.\u201d\n\nThe minister\u2019s statement on underperformance was largely accurate, Fred Omondi, a\n\n\u201cOverall the statement is correct in terms of falling short of the tax collection targets.\u201d He said reasons for this include cycles of political instability and overly \u201cambitious\u201d targets.\n\nBut the shortfall couldn\u2019t all be attributed to collection, because the tax authority had been very aggressive on this front, Omondi said. Compliance was also a factor.\n\n\u201cIn the smaller businesses, where it\u2019s a bit more difficult to enforce compliance, maybe there\u2019s some leakage as well, given the size of the so-called informal sector. There\u2019s a tendency to focus on the well-established players.\u201d\n\nConclusion: Yes, Kenya consistently fallen short on tax revenue targets since 2010\n\nKenya\u2019s finance minister claimed that the country had fallen short of meeting its tax revenue targets for the past 10 financial years.\n\nTreasury documents show this was correct for ordinary revenue for at least nine and possible all years. In one financial year, 2010/11, differing official data makes both underperformance or overperformance possible. We therefore rate this claim correct.", "lang": "en"}
