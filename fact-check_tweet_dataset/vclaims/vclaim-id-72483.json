We covered Obama\u2019s bungling of the epidemic from the Dallas debacle to the election.\n\nSlackmeyer: Have any idea how many Americans died from Ebola during that time?\n\nHedley: Um ... No. I\u2019d have to run the numbers on that.\n\nSlackmeyer: None. Not a single one. Want to know how many died of gunfire during that same period?\n\nFor the record, Trudeau is correct about the number of Americans who died from Ebola. The two people who succumbed on American soil were not American citizens.\n\nBut we wanted to take a closer look at Trudeau\u2019s statement that \"statistically, about 3,000\" people died of gunfire between the events in Dallas and the November election. That word \"statistically\" struck us as a particularly careful choice.\n\nTo refresh your memory, Thomas Eric Duncan was admitted to a Dallas hospital on Sept. 28. Duncan ultimately died and then two nurses who treated him contracted the disease. They both survived. The election took place on Nov. 4.\n\nTrudeau explained to us that he based his number on annual deaths due to guns that he found on a website run by the School of Public Health at the University of Sydney in Australia. The yearly totals only went through 2011 so Trudeau looked back five years and took the lowest number. He divided to find the weekly average and used that for the five weeks between Duncan becoming ill and the election.\n\n\"It's obviously only a statistically typical five-week period,\" Trudeau said. \"For all I know there could have been a major lull in gun violence in October. But for purposes of argumentative contrast, I felt it accurately reflected the magnitude of harm our epidemic of gun violence inflicts.\"\n\nUsing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s aptly named Wonder database , we found monthly numbers that ran through 2012. For simplicity, we summed deaths for October and the first four days of November. This approach was slightly more precise than Trudeau\u2019s and as this table shows, it more than confirmed Trudeau\u2019s claim. (Adding a few days in September would only make the case stronger.)\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly how many people died over that time period in 2014, and we won\u2019t know for about a year. But Trudeau\u2019s figure is very much in line with past trends, and as Trudeau noted to us, the numbers have been stable for many years.\n\nThe most important caveat to Trudeau\u2019s statement is that it includes suicides. In 2012, the CDC classified 20,666 deaths as due to \"intentional self-harm\" by any sort of firearm. The number of deaths by assault, or what we might call homicide? 11,622.\n\nGun violence is an umbrella term that covers all manner of deaths when a weapon is fired. It includes suicide, criminal homicide, police shootings, cases when the intent is unknown, and a strange category called \"exposure to inanimate mechanical force - firearm.\"\n\nWhen you hear about gun violence, it might suggest solely people killing each other. That would be inaccurate. Roughly two-thirds of the deaths are people killing themselves.\n\nAlso, the CDC data records the death of residents, but it doesn\u2019t track their citizenship status. Trudeau contrasted gun deaths with the deaths of Americans due to Ebola. We found no information that made the distinction.\n\nWhile Fox News devoted many minutes if not hours to Ebola coverage, and not always with pinpoint accuracy, on Oct. 15 host delivered a 4-minute monologue saying that fear of Ebola is \"not based in fact or reason.\" Smith decried the tendency of politicians and news organizations to hype the hysteria.\n\nGarry Trudeau, speaking through his characters in Doonesbury, said that in the time between the Ebola scare in Dallas and the election, \"statistically\" about 3,000 Americans died from gunfire.\n\nThe latest data from the CDC bears that out. Using a five-year average, we found 3,041 deaths in the relevant time period.\n\nGiven that the debate over gun deaths in this country often centers on homicides or accidental shootings, it is important to note that about two-thirds of the total would likely be suicides. Plus, the CDC data counts the deaths of residents, which might include some noncitizens. Still, the number of deaths is in line with what Trudeau said, even if the precise figures will vary.\n\nThe claim is accurate but it requires some clarification. Accordingly, we rate it Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
