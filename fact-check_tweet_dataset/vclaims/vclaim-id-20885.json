These websites that peddled political propaganda had come into existence around March 2018, posting inflammatory content, with most of them mocking the Congress party and Rahul Gandhi. One of these websites, Bengaluru Times, which earlier looked like this is now a website listing paying guest accommodations in the city called MIA Rooms and looks like this. #WebQoof: Shehla Rashid Isn\u2019t Booked for Tweet on Gadkari Yet\n\nWe called the contact number given for Mia Rooms and spoke to Rajesh Reddy, one of the partners in the firm. Reddy said that his partner Nagaraj G bought the domain from GoDaddy about a week ago and they are unaware of the earlier existence of the website. Several other websites like Bengaluru Mirror (www.bengalurumirror.in), Express Bangalore (http://expressbangalore.com/) and Voice of Bengaluru (http://voiceofbengaluru.com/) now have dead URLs. The website names were lifted from names of leading newspapers in the city to mislead readers, and were focused on posting stories in favour of the BJP. BOOM had investigated one of these websites, Bangalore Herald, on 2 May 2018 and found it to be a fake news website. The website had published a survey favouring the BJP using the name of a fictitious agency C-Force that sounded similar to a genuine Gurugram-based polling agency called C-Fore.\n\nWhen we looked at the website bangalore-herald.com, it became clear that the site had been created recently. We looked on whois.com and found that the site was created in the month of March with a fake US phone number. The site earlier existed as a one-page site with no menu bar or an \u2018About Us\u2019 section. The stories on the page were redirected to popular news websites like The Times of India, Economic Times, Scroll.in with the selection of stories clearly showing the ruling Congress establishment in poor light. The site is now dead and cannot be reached.\n\nThe day BOOM reported the story on 2 May, search results for news.bangalore-herald.com were being re-directed to bharatpositive.in. Bharat Positive continues to exist and publishes pro-BJP stories in Hindi and have paid special attention on the Gandhi family through articles and videos. When we searched for this site on whois.com, it had an Indian cellphone number which showed up on Truecaller as one Mukul Jindal. We had called Jindal, who denied any link with the website. He claimed that while he is a software engineer by profession and works for a fin-tech company, he had never heard of the website Bharat Positive and was not aware of why his contact number had been given on the website.\n\nThese news websites were also connected to a Facebook page called Karnataka Election Updates. BOOM had exposed this page for running a series of fake stories claiming that a poll agency titled CDS-LOKNITI had conducted a survey in each assembly constituency of Karnataka and the results declared a whopping win to the BJP. On our last search, we found that the page had stopped updating after 11 May, with the URLs to the fake websites mentioned above leading to dead links.", "lang": "en"}
