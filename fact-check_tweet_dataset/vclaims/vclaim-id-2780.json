Cutting the tax rate for these businesses, Johnson argues, would boost the economy, thus increasing the amount of revenue collected by the federal government.\n\n\u201cNew Day\u201d host Chris Cuomo asked why, if Johnson wants a better deal for \u201cthe little guy,\u201d he doesn\u2019t also favor tax cuts for the middle class. As a self-proclaimed \u201cdeficit hawk,\u201d Johnson is opposed to cutting individual income taxes out of concern that such cuts would increase the federal deficit. (Johnson\u2019s assertion that the \u201cprojected deficit\u201d could be \u201cas much as $129 trillion\u201d appears similar to a claim we have previously labeled as worthy of Three Pinocchios, but it\u2019s based on Johnson\u2019s own calculation of a Congressional Budget Office calculation that is no longer used by the agency.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not time to cut individual tax rates,\u201d he said. Instead, Johnson insists the tax cuts need to be weighted toward growing the economy, saying that even with the modest economic growth of the past few years, federal revenue has grown $1.2 trillion per year since 2009.\n\nStarting in 2009 is also misleading because the United States was in the middle of the Great Recession. A year earlier, in 2008, the government brought in $2.5 trillion in revenue. At the start of the recession in December 2007, the unemployment rate was 5 percent; by October 2009 it had reached a peak of 10 percent. Naturally, revenue from individual income taxes declined as many Americans were out of work.\n\nWhen we pointed out to Voelkel that revenue hasn\u2019t increased $1.2 trillion per year, as Johnson suggested, and asked him to clarify Johnson\u2019s argument, he sent over a clip of the senator on CNBC after his appearance on \u201cNew Day.\u201d This time around, Johnson dropped \u201cper year\u201d from his talking point and said, \u201cEven with the meager economic growth we\u2019ve had since 2009, revenue has increased to the federal government by $1.2 trillion \u2014 with meager economic growth.\u201d However, Voelkel did not respond to an email asking whether Johnson admitted he made an error on CNN.\n\nBelow are revenue estimates made by the Congressional Budget Office in 2009. You can see that the CBO estimated that in 2016, federal revenue would be $3.9 trillion \u2014 $600 billion higher than reality. So a $1.2 trillion increase since 2009 is actually below what the CBO expected in 2009.\n\nBut according to a survey of economists by the University of Chicago\u2019s Initiative on Global Markets, 37 out of 38 of economists agree the GOP tax plan would cause the U.S. debt to increase far faster than the economy. (The 38th economist later said he misread the question and actually agrees with the other 37.) In addition, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that even after taking economic growth into consideration, the House GOP tax bill would increase the debt by $1.3 trillion over a decade.\n\nThe nonpartisan CBO estimates that the federal debt could rise to 89 percent of the gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the economy, by 2027. Currently the debt is 77 percent of GDP. And by 2047 the CBO estimates the debt could reach 150 percent of GDP \u2014 the highest level in the nation\u2019s history. The debt increase is primarily due to growth in federal spending outpacing growth in federal revenue.\n\nIf current laws generally remained unchanged, the deficit would reach 5 percent of GDP by 2027 and almost 10 percent by 2047, according to the CBO. Much of the spending reflects an aging U.S. population, which \u201cwill drive up spending relative to revenues because of increased outlays for Social Security and Medicare, programs that primarily benefit people over the age of 65.\u201d\n\nIn his opposition to the GOP tax plan, Johnson makes increasing federal revenue sound as easy as cutting taxes to grow the economy, thereby boosting federal revenue. But it\u2019s an oversimplified equation. Deficits reflect federal spending as well as federal revenue. And changes to any side of the equation can have a major impact on the deficit. More importantly, many economists agree, the GOP tax plan would grow the deficit much more quickly than it would grow the economy.\n\nMoreover, to support his case, Johnson overstates the amount of revenue collected over the past several years. Johnson claimed on CNN that federal revenue increased $1.2 trillion per year since 2009 with modest economic growth; in a subsequent interview, he dropped the \u201cper year.\u201d But in any case, he\u2019s using cherry-picked numbers, as his base year is 2009, when the United States was in the midst of a devastating recession.", "lang": "en"}
