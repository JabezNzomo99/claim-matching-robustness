While speaking before the board of supervisors in early May, Levin spoke about a plan to hire more contact tracers to \u201cfind people who have COVID-19 and immediately isolate them, find every one of their contacts, make sure they stay quarantined and check in with them every day,\u201d according to Fox News.\n\n\u201cFor instance, if they live in a home where there\u2019s only one bathroom and there are three or four other people living there, and those people don\u2019t have COVID infection, we\u2019re not going to be able to keep the person in that home,\u201d Levin went on to say, according to video of the press conference. \u201cEvery person who we are isolating, for instance, needs to have their own bathroom. And so we\u2019ll be moving people like this into other kinds of housing that we have available.\u201d\n\nThe Ventura County government later clarified on Facebook that it is \u201cnot removing people from their homes\u201d and provided a statement from Levin.

We have no intention of taking people from the environments they feel safe and comfortable in.\u201d\n\nThe Ventura County Public Health Department also confirmed to the fact-checking website Lead Stories that people won\u2019t be forcibly taken out of their homes. Levin\u2019s comment referred to housing that the county has available for people who cannot self-isolate properly at home and would like to voluntarily do so elsewhere to protect others living in the household, according to the Thousand Oaks Acorn.\n\nThe state has reported over 170,000 positive COVID-19 cases to date, according to the California Department of Public Health website.", "lang": "en"}
