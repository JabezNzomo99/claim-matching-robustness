Trump, however, did not include text in the post. Some in the media speculated that it was in reference to his ability to fight off controversy during the ongoing impeachment inquiry in Congress. Others suggested that the image alluded to comments he made on Tuesday about his health during a rally in Florida, where he said doctors told him he had a \u201cgorgeous chest\u201d during a recent physical.\n\nWhatever Trump\u2019s intention for tweeting the image, it took on its own meaning for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, who displayed it during a \u201cThanksgiving Rally\u201d as an expression of gratitude for Trump\u2019s signing of legislation, passed overwhelmingly by Congress, that supports the protesters and sanctions Chinese and Hong Kong officials who violate human rights. Trump had been reluctant to sign the legislation, but the bill passed both the U.S. House and Senate by \u201cveto-proof majorities.\u201d\n\nEdited images associated with Trump\u2019s Twitter account are hardly unheard of. In October 2019, Trump tweeted an altered image of himself placing a medal on the image of Conan, the military dog injured in the operation that led to the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State terror group. The dog\u2019s head had been edited in over that of James C. McCloughan, an Army medic previously honored for saving lives in the Vietnam war.\n\nIn 2017, Trump tweeted a video showing him tackling and beating up a man with the CNN logo edited onto his head. The source was a 2007 video in which Trump had made an appearance on World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), where he body-slammed WWE owner Vince McMahon. The tweet was criticized as part of Trump\u2019s ongoing attacks on mainstream news outlets.", "lang": "en"}
