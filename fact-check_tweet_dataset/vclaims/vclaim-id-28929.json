Nevertheless, this fact- check was restricted to the latest Universities ranking done by different bodies since he emphasized on the present ranking]\n\nNIGERIA\u2019S BEST UNIVERSITY RANKS 991 ON CWUR, 1148 ON WEBOMETRICS, AND 601- 800 ON TIMES HIGHER EDUCATION WORLD UNIVERSITY RANKINGS\n\nDr Babalakin may be right on his claim if he is talking about the Times Higher Education World University rankings that ranked Covenant University as the best University in Nigeria and ranked within the 601-800 bracket in the world.\n\nThe latest Times Higher Education University 2019 rankings did not only rank Covenant University within the 601-800 bracket in the world but also placed University of Ibadan in that same category.\n\nHowever, in the 2018-2019 CWUR World University Rankings, the only Nigerian University that made the top 1000 Universities list in the world is the University of Ibadan, which took the 991st spot.\n\nFinally, the 2019 webometrics ranking released in January 2019 had the best university in Nigeria, which is University of Ibadan emerging as the 1148th University in the world.\n\nNo Nigerian University ranked 800th or below in the CWUR and Webometrics ranking, however, two Nigerian universities are ranked between 601-800 in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, which makes the claim PARTLY TRUE.\n\nThis fact-check was done by a Dubawa Fact-checking Fellow in collaboration with The Tribune Online, the online publication of the oldest surviving newsroom in Nigeria.
