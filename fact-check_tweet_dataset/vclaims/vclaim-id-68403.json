Barack Obama made his case for a number of new initiatives for such things as health care, education and energy.\n\nThose will cost money. But Obama assured that for all of his new spending proposals, he\u2019s proposed commensurate spending cuts, and then some.\n\n\"Across the country, families are tightening their belts, and so should Washington,\" Obama said. \"That\u2019s why, for my energy plan, my economic plan, and the other proposals you\u2019ll hear tonight, I\u2019ve offered spending cuts above and beyond their cost.\"\n\nNote what Obama is not saying here. He is not saying he will reduce the federal deficit, or even stabilize it. A number of non-partisan budget and tax analysts say that the deficit is likely to grow considerably under Obama\u2019s plan - mostly due to his proposed tax cuts for the middle class.\n\nWhat Obama did say is that for all of his new spending initiatives, he is proposing offsetting spending cuts.\n\n\"I think he can go out with a clear conscience and claim that,\" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which performed a detailed analysis if the budget impact of the Obama and McCain plans as revealed through the camapign.\n\nBut it's based on a number of shaky assumptions, she said.\n\nObama has proposed several nitiatives - expanded health care coverage, investments in alternative energies and increases in education spending, foreign aid and the size of the military - that the CRFB estimates at a cost of about $220 billion.\n\nOn the \"savings\" side of the ledger, the Obama campaign includes ending the Iraq war, letting tax cuts expire for people who earn more than $250,000, closing corporate tax loopholes, discouraging offshore tax havens and reducing wasteful spending.\n\nThe campaign says all those changes would yield several hundred billion dollars a year. For example, ending the Iraq war \u2014 the first five years of which cost $600-billion, according to the Pentagon \u2014 would save between $90-billion and $100-billion a year, the Obama campaign asserts. All the savings together would easily be enough to pay for all the programs Obama mentioned, along with all the other new spending and tax cuts he plans, the campaign says.\n\nBut the Obama campaign uses a few \"gimmicks\" to make its numbers work, said MacGuineas, a former adviser to the 2000 McCain for President campaign.\n\nFor example, the Obama campaign includes \"savings\" realized by a phased-down withdrawal of combat troops in Iraq. The CRFB put a $156 billion tag on that. But to include that figure as \"savings\" is shaky, MacGuineas said, inasmuch as it\u2019s double counting to include reductions in policies that we are already borrowing to pay for.\n\nIt also assumes that the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 would be extended indefinitely, even though they are set to expire in 2010. That way, Obama can claim savings with his proposal to eliminate those tax cuts for people making over $250,000 a year.\n\nThe Obama plan is also short on details when it comes to spending cuts, MacGuineas said.\n\nFor example, the campaign has pledged to save tens of billions of dollars by \"reducing and reforming government contracting\" and \"reducing wasteful spending.\" The campaign gives a few examples, she said, \"not enough to fill in all of the (claimed) savings.\"\n\n\"All of his plans to spend money have far more specifics than his plan to save money,\" MacGuineas said.\n\nIt\u2019s that lack of detail that makes many budget experts skeptical of Obama\u2019s claim.\n\nJosh Gordon, policy director at the Concord Coalition, a Washington-based nonpartisan group that advocates budget restraint, said it\u2019s a leap of faith to put a monetary figure to something like Obama\u2019s plan to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse. Which waste exactly? Which fraud? Which abuse?\n\n\"In the sense that they are trying to come up with offsets to the spending plans they are proposing, that\u2019s a good thing,\" Gordon said. \"Whether the numbers are completely accurate, I think even the campaigns would admit they are just best guesses.\"\n\nIsabel Sawhill, an associate budget director during the Clinton administration and a scholar at the Brookings Institution, said she has yet to see specific proposals for spending cuts from the Obama campaign that go beyond his more specific spending plans.\n\nThat\u2019s often true with presidential campaigns, said Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nDoes a candidate get credit for being more fiscally responsible if they talk about larger, unspecified savings?\n\n\"I think the best you can do is get a sense of what the candidates priorities are,\" Horney said. \"But at the end of the day, it\u2019s difficult to add it all up and come up with a number, then later be able to back that number up.\"\n\nAnd even if all of Obama\u2019s proposals were budget neutral, Gordon said, the country\u2019s existing debt would continue to grow. Without any changes to current policies, the Congressional Budget Office forecasts a $2.3 trillion budget deficit over the next decade.\n\n\"If there\u2019s not a net tax increase or a net cut in spending, we\u2019re just treading water as the ship is going under,\" Gordon said.\n\nThe \"all paid for\" logic also assumes you don\u2019t include Obama\u2019s proposals for a host of refundable tax credits. Some would argue those are simply spending initiatives dressed up as tax cuts.\n\n\"The overall effect of the these policies, there\u2019s no question it would put the country deeper in debt,\" MacGuineas said. \"His plan will significantly increase the budget deficit.\"\n\nA detailed analysis of the Obama tax plan by the non-partisan Tax Policy Institute concluded Obama\u2019s tax plan would increase the country\u2019s debt by $3.5 trillon over 10 years. They estimated McCain\u2019s tax cut plan would boost the deficit even more, by $5 trillion.\n\n\"He (Obama) is digging a $3.5 trillion hole that has to be filled with spending cuts,\" said Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center.\n\nTo be fair, Obama has not pledged to cut the deficit.\n\n\"I do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013,\" Obama said, \"because I think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in America\u2019s families.\"\n\nStill, experts agree that while Obama has made efforts to correlate new spending initiatives with proportionate spending cuts, his proposals to cut spending make too many best-case-scenario assumptions and are far too vague to be relied upon.
