Rodrigo Duterte is praised abroad while facing criticism in his own country, a netizen published April 6 a screengrab of a false post that claims world leaders said Pres. Rodrigo Duterte is the \u201clight of our world,\u201d and that they will follow in his footsteps.\n\nUploading it on pro-Duterte Facebook (FB) group Ang Pagbabalik Namin Mga DDS @ SARAH DUTERTE & BBM PARA SA 2022, the image showed a screenshot of a \u201cbreaking news\u201d report with the headline, \u201cALL PRESIDENT TO DUTERTE: \u2018YOU ARE THE LIGHT IN OUR WORLD\u2019 WE WILL FOLLOW THE FOOTSTEPS OF DUTERTE,\u201d accompanied by a thumbnail featuring three heads of state - Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, the United States\u2019 Donald Trump and China\u2019s Xi Jinping.\n\nNeither the URL nor name of the outfit that published the said report was provided.\n\nThere are no records of Putin, Trump, Xi, or any other world leader hailing Duterte as the \u201clight of our world\u201d and that they will follow in his footsteps.\n\nA cursory search on the Web reveals that the line is from a song that Duterte partly sang during a gala dinner for Trump and other world leaders during the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Summit in November 2017. He joined Pilita Corrales in a song \u201cIkaw,\u201d (You) that has a line, which when translated from Filipino, means: \u201cYou are the light in my world.\u201d\n\nThe song was requested by Trump, according to several news reports. China\u2019s Premier Li Keqiang attended the event on behalf of Xi Jinping, while Russia\u2019s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev went in lieu of Putin.\n\nThe fake story appeared to have been first published in late March 2018, as a report that carried the exact same headline and thumbnail was debunked around that time by website Meme Buster.\n\nThe netizen\u2019s untrue post surfaced the same day Duterte gave a televised address on April 6 about the government\u2019s latest moves in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which received mixed reviews from Filipinos. The false FB post has been shared over 300 times, received more than 700 reactions and almost 150 comments.", "lang": "en"}
