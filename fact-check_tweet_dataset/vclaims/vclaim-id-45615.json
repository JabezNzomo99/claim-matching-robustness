Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Sunrise photos taken at the Konark Temple in Odisha. Fact: While one of the photos was taken at the Angkor Wat temple in Cambodia, the other two photos were taken at the Phanom Rung temple in Thailand. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen the photo was run through Google Reverse Image Search, the same photo was found on a travel website with the following description \u2013 \u2018Angkor Wat sunrise\u2019. So, when searched with the keywords, a similar photo of the \u2018Angkor Wat\u2019 temple was found on the \u2018Getty Images\u2019 website. Many similarities can be seen in both photos.\n\nAlso, the same view of the Angkor Wat temple can be seen by facing east in the temple complex on Google Street View.\n\nA similar photo was found on the \u2018Shutterstock\u2019 website, with the following description \u2013 \u2018Amazing Tourists visit the Prasat Hin Phanom Rung \u2013 Entrance gate with sunlight shine through the door in Prasat Phanom Rung Historical Park ancient Khmer temple\u2019. Again, the similarities between the two pictures can be seen.\n\nAlso, the Google Street View confirms that the photo was taken at the entrance gate of the Phanom Rung temple in Thailand. In the \u2018Bangkok Post\u2019 article, the following can be read \u2013 \u2018From March 31 to April 2, the Phanom Rung Historical Park Festival will take place at Phanom Rung Historical Park, Buri Ram province, providing visitors a once-a-year chance to see the rays of the rising Sun through all 15 doors of the sanctuary\u2019.\n\nThis photo is also related to Phanom Rung temple in Thailand. A similar photo can be found in a blog article on the Phanom Rung temple. There are many doors in the temple; the similarities in the design of the doors can be seen in both the photos.\n\nA Google Street view of one of the similar doors in the Phanom Rang temple can be seen below.\n\nTo sum it up, none of the posted photos are related to the Konark Temple in Odisha (India).\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
