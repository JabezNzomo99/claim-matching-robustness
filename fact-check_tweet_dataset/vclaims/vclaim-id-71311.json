He treated me better than anybody\u2019s ever been treated in the history of China.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who amended the opening paragraph in this letter. It\u2019s possible that a Facebook user named \u201cCraig Alan Wilkins\u201d shared Pennyfarthing\u2019s open letter with a new introductory paragraph. While the author of the opening paragraph is still uncertain, the majority of this text was written by Aldous J Pennyfarthing, the pen name for author Tom Breuer, and was originally published on the Daily Kos in 2017. This open letter was subsequently published in Pennyfarthing\u2019s 2018 book Dear F*cking Lunatic: 101 Obscenely Rude Letters to Donald Trump.", "lang": "en"}
