Soon after, videos and images were shared claiming fires broke out in several areas. A report also emerged from Maharastra\u2019s Solapur that dry grass on the airside of the city airport caught fire.\n\nLater at night, social media users began sharing a video supposedly of the fire incident. TV9 Marathi broadcasted the visual on April 5 claiming that it depicts the fire at Solapur airport. The channel has now taken down their broadcast video from YouTube.\n\nNews 18\u2019s Marathi channel Lokmat correspondent Sagar Surawase tweeted the video with the same claim. Alt News co-founder Mohammed Zubair had retweeted Surawase\u2019s tweet but undid the same clarifying that the clip is old.\n\nJournalist Rajdeep Sardesai and Congress\u2019s Srivatsa were among the prominent individuals who claimed that a fire broke out in Solapur but later took down their tweets.\n\nA fire indeed broke out near the Solapur airport after PM Modi\u2019s 9pm-9minute event. According to The Hindu, \u201cDry grass along the airside of Solapur airport caught fire on Sunday night. The blaze is believed to have been caused by firecrackers in the vicinity.\u201d However, the video tweeted by several individuals is old and unrelated to the recent incident. With a keyword search on YouTube, we found an ABP Majhabroadcast from February 3, 2020, which carried the same video.\n\nA primary comparison of a screengrab from the ABP Majha broadcast (top) with the TV9 Marathi broadcast (bottom) from April 5 shows that both the videos are same.\n\nIn conclusion, a two-month-old video was shared as the recent fire incident at Solapur airport after the PM\u2019s \u20189PM-9Minute\u2019 blackout call was observed and subsequent reports of fire-crackers being burnt in various places across the country emerged.", "lang": "en"}
