Let\u2019s try to analyze the extent of truth in the post.\n\n\n\nClaim: Video of Haryana farmers performing last rites to Modi as a sign of protest against his government. Fact: The video shows \u2018Guest teachers\u2019 in Haryana protesting against the state government. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nThe Facebook post was made on September 30, 2019. In the comments section of the post, a user has commented that the video shows an incident that took place in Karnal 10-15 days back. \n\n\n\nWhen searched on Google with that information, with a relevant time filter and keywords \u2018protests in karnal haryana\u2019, many search results were obtained. Among them, a search result of \u2018Tribune\u2019 was found to have some part of the video clip, in its news video aired on September 17, 2019, with the title \u2018Karnal: Guest teachers hold state-level protest against Haryana government; police use water cannon\u2019. \n\n\n\nFrom the article of \u2018Times of India\u2019 published on September 18, 2019, it was found that Haryana Police have used water cannons on Guest teachers in Haryana who were protesting for regularisation of their jobs since September 1, 2019.\n\nTo conclude, this isn\u2019t the video of Haryana farmers protesting against the Modi government. It is actually that of Guest teachers in Karnal protesting against the Haryana state government.\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series?", "lang": "en"}
