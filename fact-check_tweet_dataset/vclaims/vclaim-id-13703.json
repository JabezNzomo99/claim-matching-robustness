We have looked closely many times. A few of our fact checks:\n\u2022 Does Russia Bear Responsibility for War in Ukraine?\n\nFor years, Moscow has categorically denied being a party to the conflict in eastern Ukraine, whether through sending troops or arms to fuel the conflict.\n\nBut the evidence to the contrary is overwhelming.\n\nIgor \u201cStrelkov\u201d Girkin, a leading \u201cself-defense\u201d commander in Crimea and later commander of separatist forces in eastern Ukrainia, told Zavtra newspaper in November 2014 that he \u201cwas the one who pulled the trigger of this war.\u201d\n\n\"If our unit hadn't crossed the border, everything would have fizzled out \u2014 like in [the Ukrainian city of] Kharkiv,\u201d he said.\n\n\"There would have been several dozen killed, burned, detained. And that would have been the end of it. But the flywheel of the war, which is continuing to this day, was spun by our unit. We mixed up all the cards on the table,\" he said, referring to the Russian paramilitary forces under his command.\n\nAlong with Girkin, other key military and political leaders in the self-proclaimed separatist \u201crepublics\u201d were Russian citizens, including the first \u201cDonetsk People\u2019s Republic\u201d leader Alexander Borodai, \u201cDonetsk People\u2019s Republic \u201cSparta\u201d Battalion leader Arseny \u201cMotorola\u201d Pavlov, Rusych militia leader and neo-Nazi Alexei Milchakov.\n\nAnd, as Polygraph.info previously reported, in spite of numerous denials, the evidence of Moscow\u2019s involvement in the Donbas war is overwhelming and has been confirmed by numerous open-source investigations, journalistic investigations by international and Russian media outlets, and even, at times, by Russian officials.\n\u2022 The presence of Russian military equipment in eastern Ukraine neither produced by, nor purchased by the Ukrainian armed forces, such as the T-90A main battle tanks;\n\u2022 The \u201cseparatists\u2019\" continued access to large quantities of advanced military technology and the ammunition, fuel, and spare parts to operate them;\n\u2022 A Vice report which proved the presence of Russian serviceman of the 37th Motorized Infantry Brigade (Kyakhta) operating in eastern Ukraine. Later, Russia adopted an \u201canti-selfie soldier law\" which might have prevented such public evidence;\n\u2022 And, a wealth of open source intelligence (OSINT) produced by groups such as Bellingcat and Inform Napalm demonstrating Russian military movements in Ukraine.\n\u2022 On May 24, 2018, the Dutch Joint Investigative Team (JIT) presented its findings on the system that shot down the passenger airliner MH17, which was flying over eastern Ukraine en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. The JIT determined the missile system had been provided from Russia and identified the military unit it belonged to \u2013 the Russian armed forces\u2019 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade.\n\u2022 On April 4, the family of the sole American victim of the MH17 downing sued Russia's Sberbank and VTB Bank and the Western Union Co., Western Union Financial Services, MoneyGram International, and MoneyGram Payment System for allegedly providing services to Russian backed separatists. The suit is based on a 1992 U.S. anti-terror law that allows U.S. victims of terrorism to sue those who provide material support to those carrying out the attacks.\n\n\u200bBased on the evidence available, the International Criminal Court in November 2016 determined that the war in Ukraine was a Russian invasion and not, as Russia claimed, a civil war. In response, Russia withdrew from the ICC.\n\nPolygraph.info therefore finds Peskov\u2019s denial that Moscow is party to the Ukrainian conflict to be false.", "lang": "en"}
