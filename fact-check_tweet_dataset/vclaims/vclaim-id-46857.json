Several other policemen can also be seen running around in the video. It is being claimed that the viral video is from Uttar Pradesh, showing police brutality during the ongoing protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in the state.\n\nIndia Today\u2019s Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral video is from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and is around two months old.\n\nThe archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nFacebook page Voice of India\u2019 posted the video with the caption: UP police brutality. #No_NRC #No_CAA. The post was shared more than 9,700 times at the last count.\n\nTo verify the claim attached to the viral video, we broke down the video into keyframes and ran a reverse search on one of them. We found a longer version of the viral video on a YouTube channel called KFD TV\u2019. The video was posted on October 22, 2019.\n\nAs per the description with the video, it was shot when Pakistan police resorted to lathi-charge on protesters in Muzaffarabad city of PoK. The pro-freedom rally was organised on October 22, 2019, by People\u2019s National Alliance and All Independent Parties Alliance.\n\nMany prominent media houses, including India Today, had reported about the incident.\n\nAfter receiving several complaints, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) had recently issued a notice to the police chief of Uttar Pradesh, questioning the action undertaken during the ongoing anti-CAA protests in the state.\n\nThe UP Police have issued notices to over 200 people in connection with the anti-CAA protests.\n\nHence, it is clear that the viral video has nothing to do with Uttar Pradesh. It was shot during a protest at Muzaffarabad in PoK, a couple of months before the CAA was passed in Parliament.", "lang": "en"}
