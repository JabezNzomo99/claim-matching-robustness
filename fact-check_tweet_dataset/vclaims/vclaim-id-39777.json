It appears to have originated with white nationalist writer Kevin Alfred Strom.\n\nVoltaire is one of many historical figures that routinely have quotes attributed to them that they never said. The quote attributed to Voltaire in the Facebook post appears to be one such example.

Strom also confirmed in a 2017 post online that it originated with him, not Voltaire.\n\nIt is unclear how the saying became associated with Voltaire, Gibbard told The Guardian, though the \u201cspirit\u201d of the quote was \u201cnot un-Voltarian,\u201d likely helping to spur the popular misattribution to the French philosopher and writer.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
