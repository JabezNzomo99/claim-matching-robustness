It is meant to protect Japan from North Korean attacks.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "March 26, 2018", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-9704", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-objects-to-japan-missile-system/29120339.html", "vclaim": "During his press conference in Tokyo on March 21, Lavrov said Japan\u2019s decision to deploy U.S.-made missile defense systems infringes on Russia\u2019s security. He accused Japan of actively deploying elements of the U.S. global missile defense system.\n\nJapan plans to deploy the Aegis Ashore systems to protect itself from attacks by North Korea, which test-fired a missile over Japan and threatened to use nuclear weapons to \u201csink\u201d the country after Tokyo denounced Pyongyang\u2019s latest nuclear test in 2017. The two batteries are expected to become operational by 2023 and would cost approximately $2 billion.\n\n\u200bRussian officials, however, claim the system has an offensive capability and undermines Russia\u2019s nuclear deterrent. They are concerned that, despite Japan\u2019s assertions to the contrary, the U.S. may operate and use the system as a global missile defense component to deny Russia a second-strike capability against the U.S. in case of a U.S. or allied attack on Russia.\n\nBoth points, in fact, lack merit and conceal other likely reasons for Russia\u2019s objections.\n\nOn the first point, U.S. officials have previously stated that the system is designed for tactical defense. For instance, responding to Russia\u2019s objection to the deployment of U.S. Aegis Ashore systems in eastern Europe, former U.S. Principal Deputy Secretary for Policy at the Department of Defense Brian McKeon explained as much. \u201c[The Aegis Ashore system] may look a lot like the system on a cruiser, but it lacks essential elements for launching a land-attack missile, including software, fire control hardware, and additional support equipment,\u201d he said.\u200b\n\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Arms Control, the system is \u201conly capable of launching defensive interceptor missiles,\u201d as its vertical launch platform differs from the sea-based Mark 41 VLS platform installed on sea-based Aegis systems that do have an offensive capability.\n\nOn the second point, experts say the systems would not undermine Russia\u2019s nuclear deterrent given the ranges of missiles involved. Moreover, Russia\u2019s existing strategic missiles would not only reach but could easily overwhelm U.S. missile defenses if launched in large quantities.\n\nMichael Elleman, a senior fellow for missile defense at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), concurs.\n\n\u201cAegis Ashore in Japan (or Europe) is not capable of intercepting Russian or Chinese strategic missiles. It is not a threat,\u201d he told Polygraph.info.\n\nMoreover, Russia is developing new nuclear weapon systems, which Putin unveiled in his address to parliament on March 1, to reinforce Russia\u2019s second-strike capability.\n\nThis begs the question of why Russia objects to the deployment, given its acceptance of the Japan\u2019s sea-based Aegis systems that can employ offensive weapons. According to experts, Russia is, in fact, more concerned about a growing arms race in the region, China\u2019s response to the militarization of the region, and the enhanced operational capabilities of the U.S. and its Asian allies.", "lang": "en"}
