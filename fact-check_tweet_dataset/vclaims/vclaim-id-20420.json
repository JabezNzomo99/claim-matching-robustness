The final reduction is 26% because they also raise money locally, which didn\u2019t fall by as much.\n\nLabour told us that the 40% figure quoted by Jeremy Corbyn comes from a 2014 Local Government Association press release. Again, this figure only covers the money from central government, including some funding from changes to the rules on local business rates.\n\nThese figures are only broad averages, and individual councils have had different experiences. Councils that raise more of their money from council tax revenues or savings haven\u2019t been hit as hard than others\u2014typically in urban areas serving poorer communities\u2014that are more reliant on central government grants.\n\nWe\u2019ve discussed how council budgets have changed over the last few years previously.", "lang": "en"}
