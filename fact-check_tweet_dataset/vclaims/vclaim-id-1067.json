WHY !?! Would OBAMA be posting A WEEK BEFORE ABOUT GEORGE FLOYD DEATH. Why WHEN it\u2019s NOT happened yet,\u201d one of the posts reads ( here ).\n\nThis is incorrect. Firstly, the photo of the placard was taken after Floyd\u2019s death. Photographer Christopher Dilts told Reuters he took the picture on May 30 on the riverfront in Chicago.\n\nThe image can be seen on the website of news agency Sipa USA, which confirms the date and location ( bit.ly/3dYaFWM ).\n\nWhile Floyd\u2019s image did appear in tweets predating his death, this is because the photo was set as the preview image for the foundation\u2019s website.\n\nWebsites can choose a preview image, or Twitter card, (here) to appear when the site is linked to in tweets.\n\nThe card updates automatically when the data set associated with it is changed. When this happens, all tweets that link to the site - both old and new - will show the new image. When the photo of Floyd was set as the Obama.org preview image it therefore appeared on all tweets linking to the site - including ones posted before his death.\n\nThe Obama Foundation told Reuters: \u201cThere is no truth to this internet rumor. The preview image for Obama.org updates dynamically on social media sites, based on the information set.\u201d\n\nThe foundation said this was based on a manual update of Obama.org images, which are changed periodically to reflect current events and programming.\n\nAnother example of Twitter cards being updated retroactively can be seen in tweets linking to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s website.\n\nA tweet from Trump in 2015 shows a preview image that was taken after he became president in 2017 ( here ).\n\nFalse. The photograph of the Floyd placard was taken after his death. Old tweets from the Obama Foundation featured the photo when the preview image for the site was updated.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
