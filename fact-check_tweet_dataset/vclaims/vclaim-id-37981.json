Roosevelt during his youth.\n\nThe image actually shows Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr., the fifth child of Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt served as president from 1933 until his death in 1945. He is widely recognized for his role in formulating the New Deal \u2014 a series of economic programs enacted during the Great Depression \u2014 and leading the U.S. through most of World War II.

Roosevelt as a \u201cDemocratic Socialist\u201d and \u201cthe most popular President ever,\u201d identifies the man in the seemingly colorized image as the former president. The caption says, \u201cHe was the exact kind of person that both the Democrats and Republicans are terrified of today.\u201d\n\nA reverse image search revealed that the image has actually been miscaptioned and does not, in fact, show the nation\u2019s 32nd president. The young man pictured is his son, Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr.\n\nThe Daily Progress, a Virginia newspaper, includes the image in an article describing Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr.\u2019s visit to the University of Virginia law school in February 1937. It\u2019s unclear, however, if a photographer for The Daily Progress took the picture during that visit or used an already-circulating picture of the younger Roosevelt.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt Jr. went on to have a political career of his own, serving as a New York congressman from 1949 to 1955 and as President John F. Kennedy\u2019s undersecretary of commerce. He also became the first chairman of the Equal Employment and Opportunity Commission under then-President Lyndon Johnson.", "lang": "en"}
