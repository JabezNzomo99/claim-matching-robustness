But no such studies exist, and the drug is not widely used for malaria in much of the world.\n\nTrump has aggressively promoted hydroxychloroquine for weeks, despite limited evidence at this point that it is safe or effective to treat COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. And he has latched on to indications it could be working \u2014 even if the basic facts undermine his argument.\n\n\u201cIt is extremely unlikely that relatively low rates of the [coronavirus] infection in sub-Saharan Africa are related to the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine,\u201d Michigan State University malaria researcher Terrie Taylor told us, also referring to a similar malaria drug Trump has pushed as a COVID-19 treatment. \u201cNeither has been the first-line treatment for malaria illness for many years.\u201d\n\nTrump first suggested hydroxychloroquine was behind other nations\u2019 low COVID-19 counts in a March 23 coronavirus press briefing. \u201cAnd countries with malaria have had a interesting thing happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThey take this particular drug \u2014 it\u2019s a very powerful drug \u2014 and there is very little semblance of the virus in those countries. And there are those that say because this drug is very prevalent because of the malaria.\u201d\n\nHe broached the idea again in another press briefing on April 4 after falsely claiming that \u201cpeople with lupus,\u201d who also take hydroxychloroquine to treat symptoms of their disease, \u201caren\u2019t catching this horrible virus.\u201d\n\nAs we have written, it\u2019s not yet known whether lupus patients taking the drug are less susceptible to infection with the new virus. But it\u2019s clear that being on the drug is not a panacea. Registry data from early April show that a quarter of patients with rheumatic diseases who have contracted COVID-19 were already taking hydroxychloroquine.\n\nAs we did with Trump\u2019s lupus remarks, we did check it out. We could find no studies that back his claim, and experts we consulted were also unaware of any such studies. The White House did not respond to our request for more information.\n\nIt\u2019s nevertheless true that many countries where malaria is common, including much of sub-Saharan Africa, haven\u2019t reported a lot of COVID-19 cases \u2014 at least not yet.\n\nGlobal tallies from the World Health Organization show that the day Trump made his latest remarks, the African region had fewer than 5,500 confirmed coronavirus cases and only 170 deaths, out of more than 1 million cases and nearly 57,000 deaths worldwide. As of April 8, the count had risen to more than 7,600 cases and 326 deaths.\n\nMalaria, which is caused by a parasite that is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes, occurs in other places, dictated in large part by climate and season. But as the WHO says, the African region has a \u201cdisproportionately high share of the global malaria burden,\u201d including 93% of all cases and 94% of deaths in 2018. On April 4, only 680 COVID-19 cases had been reported in the six African nations that collectively account for more than half of the world\u2019s malaria cases.\n\nThere\u2019s little reason, however, to think that\u2019s because of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, for the simple fact that few people in malaria-prone countries are taking the drugs.\n\nChloroquine was once the go-to drug for malaria treatment in Africa, Taylor explained, but is no longer because the malaria parasite evolved and developed resistance to the drug. Hydroxychloroquine, which is a slightly modified version of chloroquine that is generally considered to be safer, suffers from the same problem; Taylor said it never has been a first-line malaria treatment in Africa.\n\n\u201cWHO and the various national malaria control programmes across the continent all recommend artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for the first line treatment of uncomplicated malaria,\u201d Taylor said in an email from Malawi, a small landlocked country in southeastern Africa. \u201cThere are a number of different approved combination drugs, and each country has made its own policy recommendations \u2014 but no African country recommends that malaria patients receive chloroquine now.\u201d\n\nChloroquine, she added, \u201chas virtually disappeared from many of these countries.\u201d\n\nIn Malawi, where Taylor is doing research, getting chloroquine is \u201cactually quite difficult,\u201d she said, because it\u2019s been withdrawn from the national formulary and is \u201conly available by special request.\u201d\n\nMiriam Laufer, a malaria researcher and pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Maryland, told us that chloroquine is \u201cstill available in the private sector in some countries, like Nigeria, but it is not used routinely for treatment of malaria and is not part of national treatment policies.\u201d\n\nLaufer agreed with Taylor that it would be extremely unlikely that the low numbers of COVID-19 cases in sub-Saharan Africa would be due to the use of these drugs.\n\nWhere Chloroquine Is Used\n\nRic Price, a professor of global health at the Menzies School of Health Research in Australia, also told us it was \u201chighly implausible\u201d that antimalarials were responsible for the lower COVID-19 counts in countries with malaria.\n\n\u201cYou would have to have enough of the population being treated for malaria,\u201d he said in an email, \u201cand residual levels of the drug staying in the blood for weeks to provide protection against the virus.\u201d\n\nWhile chloroquine is still used to treat malaria in some countries to target a different species of parasite that largely remains sensitive to the drug, Price said only a tiny fraction of the populations in those countries would be on the medication for malaria treatment \u2014 and \u201calmost no one\u201d would be taking drugs for prevention.\n\nPrice calculated that at best, less than 0.5% of those populations would have taken chloroquine at some point in the past year.\n\nThen there is the issue of timing and dosing of chloroquine. \u201cIt hangs around for a few weeks in blood,\u201d Price said, \u201cbut will only provide protection from malaria for a week (max 4 weeks).\u201d\n\nEven if chloroquine is effective against COVID-19, far fewer than 0.5% of the population would have taken the drug at the right time to be protected. And as Price noted, lab studies suggest that compared with malaria, much more of the drug is needed to have any effect on the virus, so the amounts people might have taken are \u201chighly unlikely to have any impact.\u201d\n\nThe WHO also has cautioned that the dosages for malaria are different than those being explored for COVID-19.\n\n\u201cIn the context of the COVID-19 response, the dosage and treatment schedules for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine that are currently under consideration do not reflect those used for treating patients with malaria,\u201d the WHO website says. \u201cThe ingestion of high doses of these medicines may be associated with adverse or seriously adverse health outcomes.\u201d\n\nFinally, while current maps of the coronavirus pandemic might make it look like much of Africa is escaping relatively unscathed, many are bracing for a surge.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty confident that COVID-19 is going to become an important epidemic in Africa,\u201d said Peter Hotez, a professor and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s just that there hasn\u2019t been much monitoring and testing.\u201d\n\nPrice also suspects testing will be a problem. \u201cI very much doubt we will see any of the real picture of Covid19 in poor malaria endemic countries,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause they will be testing a tiny fraction of [the] number.\u201d\n\nThe WHO, which has been worried since the start of the outbreak about the damage the virus might inflict on Africa\u2019s weaker health systems, issued a press release on April 7 noting that the virus \u201cwas slow to reach the continent compared to other parts of the world,\u201d but that \u201cinfection has grown exponentially in recent weeks and continues to spread.\u201d The continent\u2019s first case was identified on Feb. 14 in Egypt, nearly a month after the first U.S. case.\n\nThe dearth of cases \u2014 if in fact real, and not due to a lack of testing \u2014 could stem from a variety of factors, including differences in international travel or possibly even the climate.\n\nAs we\u2019ve previously explained, there is some precedent for virus transmission to wane as it becomes hotter and more humid, although it\u2019s not known yet if this applies to the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2. A recent summary of the latest research on the topic from the National Academies of Sciences notes that in the lab, SARS-CoV-2 seems to survive less well under higher temperatures and humidity levels, but it\u2019s less clear whether that has any impact on virus transmission in the real world \u2014 and countries currently in \u201csummer\u201d climates have still seen the virus spread.\n\nIf climate does turn out to be important for this virus, the very conditions that allow malaria to flourish could help limit the extent of the outbreak in certain countries.\n\nExperts, however, caution against coming to any premature conclusions. \u201cThe potential explanations for why sub-Saharan Africa is lagging behind other countries vis-a-vis COVID19 are fueling LOTS of conversations and speculation,\u201d said Taylor.\n\nOnly time and more testing, plus \u201csome epidemiological rigor,\u201d she said, will tell.", "lang": "en"}
