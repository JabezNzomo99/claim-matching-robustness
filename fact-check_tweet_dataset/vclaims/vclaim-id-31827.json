The top band says \"desh ke naam Modi ka sambodhan - part 2\".\n\nThis is an old hoax from 2017 which has resurfaced after Modi's recent electoral victory. There are several points that show it is a poorly photoshopped image.\n\nFirst, the red graphics plate saying \"aaj raat se poore Bharat mein sharab bandh\" has been abysmally juxtaposed over an Aajtak screen grab.\n\nThe parts of the original logo of Aajtak in the screen grab are still visible behind the photoshopped logo.\n\nThe customised time clock beneath the Aajtak logo is also missing. Along the borders of the image, currency notes can be seen in the background, indicating that the morphed image of Aajtak has been laid over some other image.\n\nLast but not the least, this picture of PM Modi is from 2017 New Year's speech. Aajtak never telecast any such news.\n\nALSO READ | Did Wayanad celebrate Rahul Gandhi\u2019s victory with Pakistani flags?\n\nALSO WATCH | Did PM Modi spend Rs 80 lakh on make-up?", "lang": "en"}
