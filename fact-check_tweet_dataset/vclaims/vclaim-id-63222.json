It has been shared more than 460 times.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption reads: \u201cJust a glimpse, of what appears to be:\n\n\u201cSGH getting ready for the worst to come!! They converted the carparks to wards ... so please stay home !\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nSingapore has confirmed 926 cases of COVID-19 and three deaths as of March 31, 2020.\n\nCOVID-19 has killed at least 33,257 people and infected 697,244 others worldwide, according to this situation dashboard from the World Health Organization.\n\nThe photo of the hospital car park was also shared alongside a similar claim on Facebook here, here and here.\n\nHowever, the claim is misleading.\n\nSGH issued a statement on its official Facebook page on March 30, 2020 clarifying that its car park would temporarily be used as a COVID-19 testing area.\n\nIt reads: \u201cWe are aware of a message circulating on social media and text messaging platforms that SGH is converting its carpark into wards. This is totally untrue.\n\n\u201cPart of the multi-storey carpark is used as an extended facility to assess patients conveyed by designated ambulances for COVID-19. Patients are not admitted to this facility as there are no inpatient amenities.\n\n\u201cWe urge the public to be socially responsible and not to share news from unverified source.\u201d\n\nOn March 20, 2020, SGH issued a statement announcing the conversion of its car park facilities as the number of COVID-19 cases increased in Singapore.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cAs the number of COVID-19 cases increases nationally, SGH has extended our testing capacity to receive patients conveyed by designated ambulances.\n\n\u201cThe extended capacity is located at a multi-storey car park on campus, and does not accept walk-in patients. Public who are unwell are advised to visit their nearest Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs), GP clinics or Polyclinics. The doctors will assess and refer you to any hospital if you are suspected to have COVID-19.\u201d\n\nThe car park was temporarily converted to screen for anyone presenting with a fever, according to this report published by the Singapore-based The Straits Times on March 20, 2020.", "lang": "en"}
