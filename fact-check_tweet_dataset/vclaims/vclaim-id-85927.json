And for the second time, they gave you four Pinocchios, which is their highest level of falsehood. How do you respond to that, sir?\n\nREP. DARRELL ISSA: Well, first of all, the first one was for quoting something that was in somebody else\u2019s report, believing that it was true, which is an unusual way to get four Pinocchios. But in this case, the secretary of state was responsible for this normalization policy that existed in Benghazi. Witnesses have told us that they asked for help. The president himself implied that he told Leon Panetta, then secretary of defense, to use what efforts they could and what we know for a fact is not one aircraft, not one rescue of DOD was launched to get there in that 8 1/2 hours.\n\nISSA: Well, the use in answering questions in a political fundraiser, that was in response to a question, the term \u201cstand down\u201d is not used in some sort of an explicit way, but rather the failure to react, the fact that only State Department assets and only assets inside the country were ever used, that members of the armed forces, gun carrying, trained people were not allowed to get on the aircraft to go and attempt to rescue. Those kinds of things through State Department resources represent a stand-down. Not maybe on the technical terms of \u201cstand down, soldier,\u201d but on what the American people believe is a failure to respond what they could have.\n\nThe Fact Checker awarded Four Pinocchios because every single cable from Washington \u2014 hundreds of thousands of them a year, even the most mundane \u2014 automatically receives the secretary of state\u2019s signature, per State Department protocol. Very few cables are ever shown to the secretary before being sent, and there is no evidence that Clinton ever saw this particular cable.\n\nPerhaps Issa has forgotten he signed the report? He certainly didn\u2019t when he appeared on \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d as this is the question that prompted his Pinocchio-worthy comment: \u201cChairman Issa, you\u2019ve been on this from day one; you released a 43-page report. And in it, it says what about what the former secretary of state knew?\u201d Later in the interview, Issa referred to \u201cour report\u201d and \u201cour investigation.\u201d\n\nAs we noted at the time, the report \u201cveered close to the edge\u201d with its phrasing but its language was not as objectionable as Issa\u2019s comments. He also did not contradict the television host, who all but accused Clinton of committing perjury in her testimony before Congress.\n\nIn his response to Wallace, Issa moves the goal posts. \u201cWe know for a fact is not one aircraft, not one rescue of DOD was launched to get there in that 8 1/2 hours,\u201d he said. Here, he confirms our reporting that Panetta did issue a series of orders, but because of the location of assets, they didn\u2019t arrive until the next day.\n\nIssa then tries to redefine the term \u201cstand down\u201d as \u201cthe failure to react,\u201d when in fact Panetta and DOD did react. He also claims that \u201cmembers of the Armed Forces \u2014 gun carrying, trained people \u2014 were not allowed to get on the aircraft to go and attempt to rescue.\u201d He does not mention that the Special Operations commander in question later told investigators that the decision was correct in hindsight because his team otherwise would not have been in Tripoli to deal with the wounded arriving from Benghazi.", "lang": "en"}
