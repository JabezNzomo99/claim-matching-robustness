This image was frequently accompanied by the claim that it showed \u201cTrump\u2019s America.\u201d\n\nAlthough Trump truly sent federal troops to U.S. cities, the above-displayed image does not show a real soldier patrolling a street in the United States. This was actually digital artwork created circa 2016 by Michael Andrew Nash.\n\nNash reshared this image (as well as several other renderings of the same CG model) to his Instagram page in November 2019, along with hashtags such as #design #conceptart #zbrush (a digital sculpting tool) and #future. On July 27, after this image was shared as genuine by political commentator Cheri Jacobus, Nash wrote that it was \u201cgreat to fool political nutters.\u201d\n\nIn June 2019, Nash shared a brief video showing the creation of this \u201cvested\u201d police officer.", "lang": "en"}
