The EU customs union is a free trade area in which countries can\u2019t put tariffs on goods and services imported from each other, and set the same tariff for countries outside the union.\n\nThe withdrawal agreement only sets out the immediate terms of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU. The future trading relationship with the EU would need to be negotiated once the UK has left. While that trade deal was being negotiated (until the end of the transition period), the UK would remain in the single market and customs union.\n\nDuring this period it would be possible to negotiate a trade deal that doesn\u2019t keep the UK in the single market and customs union (indeed, that was the kind of deal the UK and EU negotiators agreed to try and pursue if the withdrawal agreement was passed).\n\nBut if the two sides failed to agree a future relationship, the Irish backstop\u2014part of the withdrawal agreement\u2014would come into force.\n\nThat Irish backstop contains a customs union between the UK and EU, but the UK would be outside of the EU\u2019s single market. Northern Ireland would, however, remain aligned to the rules of the single market necessary to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. It would not cover free movement of people or single market rules on services, only a subset of the single market rules on goods.\n\nWe factchecked the rest of the debate here.", "lang": "en"}
