We searched the Nexis news database and couldn\u2019t find any other news organization using the \u201ctenfold\u201d language.\n\nOn July 7, Trump tweeted about a Washington Times article that quoted White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany saying, in a July 6 press briefing, that there had been a \u201ctenfold\u201d decrease in deaths.\n\n\u201cThe president is not downplaying the severity of the virus,\u201d McEnany said in response to a reporter\u2019s question about Trump\u2019s false claim that \u201c99%\u201d of COVID-19 cases \u201care totally harmless.\u201d She explained: \u201cWhat the president is noting is that at the height of this pandemic we were at 2,500 deaths per day. We are now at a place where on July 4 there were 254. That\u2019s a tenfold decrease in mortality.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t know where McEnany got those figures; the White House didn\u2019t tell us.\n\nThe data aggregation website Worldometer reports that there were 2,748 coronavirus-related deaths on April 21 \u2014 at the peak \u2014 and 265 deaths on July 4. Those aren\u2019t the same totals McEnany cited \u2014 but it was a tenfold decrease, as she said.\n\nHowever, daily deaths have increased in the days since \u2014 including in Arizona, California, Florida, South Carolina and Texas \u2014 meaning Trump\u2019s \u201ctenfold\u201d talking point is stale.\n\nOn July 14, the day of Trump\u2019s press conference, there were 935 deaths, according to Worldometer. That\u2019s only a threefold decrease from the number of deaths on April 21.\n\nSlightly different totals from two other sources also show less of a decline in daily deaths than Trump claimed.\n\nThere was a high of 2,752 deaths on April 15 and a total of 954 deaths on July 14, according to the New York Times. That\u2019s a threefold decrease, as well.\n\nIn addition, the COVID Tracking Project reports that there were 736 deaths on July 14, which would be a nearly fourfold decrease from the peak of 2,742 deaths it reports for May 7. We have included a chart of that website\u2019s totals to better illustrate how the number of daily deaths has changed over time. (Scroll to the right to see the full chart.)\n\nThere also hasn\u2019t been a tenfold decline in the seven-day average of deaths, which accounts for fluctuations in daily totals over a full week.\n\nHere are those averages at their high point, and on July 14, according to Worldometer, the New York Times and the COVID Tracking Project.\n\nEach source shows a decline of less than fourfold over those time periods.\n\nTrump does have a point that daily deaths from COVID-19 \u201care way down\u201d from their previous highs, as Trump noted in a July 9 interview on Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News show. The president claimed a \u201ctenfold\u201d decrease in \u201cmortality\u201d then, too. But on July 9, the number of daily deaths was already higher than it had been over the July 4 weekend.\n\nAnd on July 14, it also was no longer the case that deaths had been \u201ccut tenfold,\u201d which is what Trump said in the Rose Garden. He has simply ignored the increases in daily deaths that have occurred since July 4.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.
