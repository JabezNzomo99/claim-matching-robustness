Or any of the other numerous safe countries they\u2019ve passed though [sic] en route\u2026 \u201cAnd who under the Geneva Convention should seek refuge in the first safe country they come to. If they were genuine, that\u2019s what they\u2019d do. They\u2019re not genuine. Just illegal migrants on the take.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve had help writing this article from Dr Violeta Moreno-Lax, Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) in Law, and Founder of the Immigration Law Programme, at Queen Mary University of London.\n\nThe above comments, made by former UKIP politician and Brexit campaigner Suzanne Evans, relate to cases in 2019 of people trying to cross the Channel from France to England in small boats.\n\nMs Evans cannot know whether the people trying to cross the channel in recent months would be recognised as refugees. This is to be determined by immigration officials in whichever country reviews their asylum applications.\n\nShe is also incorrect to say that refugees should seek refuge in the first safe country they come to. Under the UN Refugee Convention, there is no obligation on refugees to do this\u2014an interpretation which is upheld in UK case law. Those trying to cross the Channel can legitimately claim asylum in the UK if they reach it.\n\nThat said, there is some UK domestic law which allows the government to refuse to consider an asylum application if it is judged that the person could have claimed asylum elsewhere. Refugees who arrive in the UK after passing through another EU country can, under certain circumstances, also be returned to the first EU country they entered, under an EU law known as the Dublin Regulation.\n\nWhat is a refugee? And what is an asylum seeker?\n\nThe 1951 UN Refugee Convention (also known as the Geneva Convention) defines what a refugee is, what rights a refugee has, and the responsibilities of states towards refugees.\n\nIt defines a refugee as someone who \u201cowing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion\u201d has fled their own country or (if they have no nationality) country of usual residence, and is unable or unwilling to return to it or seek protection from it.\n\nBeing recognised as a refugee gives you the right to not be returned to the country you have fled, as well as a minimum standard of rights and freedoms in a safe country.\n\nAn asylum seeker is someone who is in need, and search, of refuge. The right to seek asylum from persecution in other countries is a universal human right, set out in Article 14 of the UN Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nPractically speaking, an asylum seeker is someone who has applied for refugee status (or another form of international protection) in another country, and is awaiting a decision on that application. They can only apply once they physically reach the country.\n\nIn the UK, once an asylum seeker has had their application processed, they may receive permission to stay as a refugee for five years (after which they can apply to settle in the UK). They may also be given \u201cpermission to stay for humanitarian reasons\u201d or other reasons, or their application may be rejected in which case, if no appeal is successful, they have to leave the UK unless they face a \u201creal risk\u201d of serious harm in the case of deportation.\n\nThere is no obligation on refugees to claim asylum in the first safe country they reach\n\nMs Evans is wrong to claim that, under the Geneva Convention, refugees should seek refuge in the first safe country they come to.\n\nIt contains no obligation \u201ceither explicit or implicit\u201d for refugees to claim asylum in the first safe country they reach, according to immigration lawyer Colin Yeo.\n\nThis means that an asylum seeker can arrive in France (or any other country) before travelling to the UK and still legitimately claim to be a refugee. It is then down to the UK to review that application.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that these individuals are illegally crossing the channel\n\nMs Evans describes those seeking to cross the Channel to the UK in small boats as \u201cillegal migrants\u201d.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s certainly true that crossing the Channel without authorisation isn\u2019t a legal way to enter the UK, Article 31 of the UN Refugee Convention states that refugees cannot be penalised for entering the country illegally to claim asylum if they are \u201ccoming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened\u201d provided they \u201cpresent themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence\u201d.\n\nA lot depends here on how to interpret which country people are \u201ccoming directly from\u201d. It could be argued, for instance, that as the people crossing the channel are coming directly from France\u2014which is not the country they initially fled\u2014they don\u2019t have the right to claim asylum in the UK.\n\nHowever, in 1999 a UK judge ruled that \u201csome element of choice is indeed open to refugees as to where they may properly claim asylum.\u201d The judge specified that \u201cany merely short term stopover en route\u201d to another country should not forfeit the individual\u2019s right to claim refugee status elsewhere.\n\nThis means people can legitimately make a claim for asylum in the UK after passing through other \u201csafe\u201d countries. Once in the UK it is then up to the authorities to review that application.\n\nWhile Ms Evans\u2019 claim focused on the Geneva Convention however, as the House of Commons Library says: \u201cExisting UK asylum laws give some scope to refuse to consider an application if it is judged that the person could have claimed asylum elsewhere.\u201d This law means that an application could be found to be \u2018inadmissible\u2019 if, for example, another country is considered to be a \u2018safe third country\u2019 or another EU member state has already granted the person refugee status.\n\nMs Evans also says \u201cno one needs refuge from France\u201d. However, it cannot be stated with certainty that these individuals crossing the Channel were safe in France (or any other country) unless we know more about their backgrounds. For example, the European Court of Human Rights has previously found an EU country (Greece) to pose a risk to an Afghan refugee, therefore upholding the refugee\u2019s right to seek asylum elsewhere (Belgium). There is also previous evidence of asylum seekers and migrants in France not being treated as they should be according to French law.\n\nThat said, the UK can sometimes return refugees to elsewhere in the EU\n\nThe UK could, under certain circumstances, send the people crossing the Channel on dinghies back to France or another EU country upon arrival. This is because of an EU law known as the Dublin Regulation.\n\nDr Sarah Singer, Senior Lecturer in Refugee Law at the Refugee Law Initiative, University of London told Full Fact that \u201cthere is nothing in the 1951 Refugee Convention which requires an asylum seeker to lodge a claim for asylum in the first, or indeed any country, they may pass through on their way to the country in which they eventually make a claim for asylum. Equally, there is nothing to prohibit an asylum seeker from lodging a legitimate asylum claim having passed through other 'safe' countries.\n\n\u201cHowever, the absence of explicit guidance on this topic in the Refugee Convention gives States some scope to adopt a 'safe third country' approach and seek to remove/readmit an asylum seeker to another country to have their claim considered there. This is the basis for the EU's 'Dublin system'.\u201d\n\nUnder the terms of the Dublin Regulation \u201cthere is no obligation on asylum seekers to claim in the first country they enter. Rather, they set out a hierarchy of criteria for states to decide which country should assume responsibility for considering the asylum application\u201d, according to the House of Commons Library. Having said that: \u201cone of the relevant factors for determining responsibility is which Member State the asylum seeker first entered or claimed asylum in.\u201d\n\nIn practice, this means that upon arrival in the UK asylum seekers will have their fingerprints checked against an EU database known as Eurodac. The database allows immigration officials to see if an asylum seeker has launched an application in any other EU countries, or come into contact with the authorities there, and determine which country should process their claim.\n\nThere are some cases in which this rule doesn\u2019t apply. For example, if an applicant for asylum has a family member who has already successfully claimed asylum in another EU country, then that country is where their claim should be reviewed. There are a number of further exceptions, including if the applicant is a minor, if several family members claim asylum around the same time, or if the applicant is dependent on the assistance of a parent or family member legally resident in the EU.", "lang": "en"}
