Actually, the news published in https://wp.me/pCXJT-acX is right and other sources like Hindustan Times, Times of India suppressed many facts to cover the raise of Jihadi activities in Rajasthan. One of my relatives stays in Jhalawar, I asked him the facts about the current murder of Rishiraj. That relative fully supported the news published in http://www.hinduexistence.org and condemned the fats suppression by others.\n\n Perhaps this FactCrescendo site is a pro jihadi or pro christian group running in the ideas of pseudo-secularism.", "lang": "en"}
