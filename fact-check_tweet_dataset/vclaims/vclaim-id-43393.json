A breakthrough suggesting otherwise would warrant notice of international TV coverage; not a mere social media posting or blog site.\n\nIn a string of never-ending falsehood relating to COVID-19 would-be cure comes this Facebook post.\n\nThe image further stated that the US President Donald Trump will officially make the announcement of the breakthrough vaccine cure on the 29th of March(Sunday).\n\nThe post further says Roche Medial company, the supposed company that was found the vaccine will launch it on the 29th of March.\n\nFirstly, Dubawa sent a mail to Roche Medical information service so as to ascertain the veracity of this viral image; lest individuals use this \u201csuccess story of the vaccine\u201d, inadvertently defying government orders of complete lockdown.\n\nSoon after, we received a prompt response from Roche\u2019s group debunking the Facebook post. Without mincing words, Roche Group Media Relations said that they are not in the vaccine business. Rather, they developed a PCR test for tracing COVID-19.\n\nA PCR test means Polymerase chain reaction(used for HIV); this test is used to screen blood and to detect very early infections in humans within a short amount of time.\n\nThere is currently no cure or vaccine for Covid-19. Peradventure a cure or vaccine surfaces, the appropriate authorities will announce it\u2019s existence. Until then, Dubawa advises the public to strictly adhere to churned out guidelines, rules and regulations by federal authorities. It is for your safety and to prevent infection.", "lang": "en"}
