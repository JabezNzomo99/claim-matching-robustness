That\u2019s different to trading under WTO terms.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-25263", "url": "https://fullfact.org/europe/no-kenya-doesnt-export-flowers-eu-wto-terms/", "vclaim": "No, Kenya doesn\u2019t export flowers to the EU on WTO terms\n\nIt\u2019s incorrect to say that Kenya trades with the EU (or by extension, the UK) on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, as was claimed by an MP this week.\n\nThe WTO sets rules which require member countries to apply tariffs and trade regulations in a non-discriminatory way to each other. This is known as trading on WTO terms. We\u2019ve written more on this here.\n\nHowever countries can strike trade agreements allowing them to treat each other better than under standard WTO terms. So the EU trades with some countries via an agreement, and others under WTO terms.\n\nKenya currently trades with the EU under such an agreement, the EU\u2019s Market Access Regulation. That reduces tariffs and quotas on Kenyan imports compared to if Kenya traded with the EU under WTO terms.\n\nLet\u2019s take the example of flowers mentioned by Andrea Jenkyns in the House of Commons this week.\n\nThere is no tariff on importing roses from Kenya because of the Market Access Regulation.\n\nHowever importing roses from the USA (with whom we have no trade agreement and so trade with under WTO rules), for example, incurs a tariff of 8.5%.\n\nWe contacted Ms Jenkyns\u2019 office who said she was trying to highlight the fact that perishable goods (such as flowers) are currently able to come from relatively far-off countries (such as Kenya) without problems such as backlogs at Calais when crossing the Channel.\n\nKenya has also agreed a wider trade deal with the EU, but it\u2019s not in force yet\n\nIn 2016 Kenya signed a trade agreement with the EU. The agreement had been negotiated between the EU and five African nations including Kenya.\n\nBut of the five African states, only Kenya has fully ratified the agreement, so it hasn\u2019t yet come into force.", "lang": "en"}
