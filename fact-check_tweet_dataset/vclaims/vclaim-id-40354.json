Trump has defended himself by characterizing impeachment proceedings as a political \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nPelosi never made the remark quoted in Trump\u2019s tweet, however. The words that Trump put in quotation marks and attributed to her were actually made by Fox News host Mike Emanuel.\n\nEmanuel said, \u201cHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi circulating a memo to Democrats tonight, telling them it would be dangerous to let voters decide President Trump\u2019s fate when it comes to the Ukraine investigation.\u201d Emanuel made the comment during the Fox News program \u201cFox News @ Night,\u201d which airs between 11 p.m. and 12 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. Trump\u2019s tweet was posted shortly after the program aired.\n\nThe memo that Pelosi sent doesn\u2019t state that it would be dangerous to let voters decide Trump\u2019s fate in office. Her exact statement reads as follows:\n\nThe facts are uncontested: that the President abused his power for his own personal, political benefit, at the expense of our national security interests. The weak response to these hearings has been, \u201cLet the election decide.\u201d That dangerous position only adds to the urgency of our action, because the President is jeopardizing the integrity of the 2020 elections.\n\nIt concludes, \u201cNone of us comes to Congress to impeach a President, but rather to make progress for America\u2019s working families. However, our first order of business is our oath to support and defend the Constitution from all enemies foreign and domestic. As such, we are custodians of the Constitution and, For The People, defenders of our democracy.\u201d\n\nPelosi sees the upcoming 2020 election and the House impeachment inquiry separately. Her statement was a reflection of previous comments in which she has said legislators in Congress are duty-bound by the Constitution to move forward with impeachment proceedings, rather than dropping them simply because a presidential election is one year away. As the Washington Post reported, Pelosi made this distinction during a recent news conference:\n\nDuring an Oct. 17 [2019] news conference, a reporter asked Pelosi \u201chow important is it for impeachment to bleed over into an election year?\u201d Pelosi responded that \u201cimpeachment is about the truth and the Constitution,\u201d whereas elections should deal instead with policy issues like gun control and climate change. \u201cThat has nothing to do with what is happening in terms of our honoring our oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution and the facts that might support,\u201d Pelosi said. Pressing Pelosi, the reporter asked: \u201cAt what point might you say, let\u2019s just let the voters decide?\u201d \u201cNo, no. The voters are not going to decide whether we honor our oath of office,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThey already decided that in the last election.\u201d\n\nDemocrats took the majority away from Republicans in the 2018 U.S. House midterm elections, which many saw as a referendum on Trump\u2019s tenure in office. U.S. Rep. Al Green, who was also mentioned in Trump\u2019s tweet, was one of the first Democratic lawmakers to come out in favor of impeachment.", "lang": "en"}
