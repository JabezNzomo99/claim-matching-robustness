The text further mentions that he sought blessings from people as his health has been deteriorating since a few days. However, we found that the image in question shows a fake tweet and Amit Shah himself tweeted on Saturday, 9 May, saying that he is not suffering from any disease and rumours about his ill health are wrong.

I don\u2019t have enmity with any person of any religion or culture. Due to my ailing health, I have not been able to serve my nation in the past few days, and this makes me extremely sad but I am suffering from bone cancer. I hope during the Holy month of Ramzan, even the Muslims of this country will pray for my health and I will recover soon and serve you once again.] Several social media users shared the image on Facebook.

MHA Think Tank Removes Manual on Sources For Spotting Fake News Further, the way the text has been aligned in the viral tweet is very different from the way actual tweets appear. The text, in Amit Shah\u2019s original tweet, is aligned in a straight line and does not wrap around the profile picture as seen in the viral image. Even the alignment of the engagement statistics is not as per the authentic rule as seen in the original tweet on the right. While the above display showed the desktop view, even on TweetDeck and mobile view, the alignment of engagement numbers is not the same as the one seen in the viral image. Left: Tweet seen on TweetDeck. Right: Tweet seen on mobile.\n\nWhile scanning Amit Shah\u2019s Twitter profile, we did not find any such text as mentioned in the viral image. His last tweet without using any pictures was on Friday, 8 May, when he expressed his condolences to the people who lost their lives due to a rail accident in Maharashtra. On Saturday, 9 May, he released a statement saying that \u201crumours about his ill health are wrong.\u201d He further stated that he was \u201ccompletely healthy\u201d and is not suffering from any disease. Evidently, a viral image purportedly showing a tweet by Home Minister Amit Shah was used to falsely claim that he has bone cancer.
