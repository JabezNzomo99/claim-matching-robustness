No, that's not true: the story was made up by a site that constantly fabricates tales of weird sex acts, crazy people or bizarre crimes, all for entertainment purposes. None of it is real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by World News Daily Report on September 2, 2018 titled \"Georgia: 66-year-old woman auctions her virginity to highest bidder to pay for sex change\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nAtlanta, GA | A 66-year-old woman is auctioning her virginity online so she can afford a $50,000 sex reassignment surgery. Kathy McAllister, a recently retired elementary school teacher, enlisted the help of Cinderella Escorts to sell her body online after coming across the website in a newspaper. McAllister, who was born in 1952, says she thought her age would drive up the bidding and claims she has a certified medical note confirming her virginity. \"There are a lot of young women auctioning their virginity online, but a 60-year-old virgin is like a great tasting aged wine,\" she told reporters when reached by phone.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\n\nThe woman in the picture is actually only 60 and her name is Paula Abraham, she made the press for her fight with Alzheimer's disease:\n\nThe website World News Daily Report is a well known satire website specialized in posting hoaxes and made up stories. The disclaimer on their website is pretty clear about that even though you have to scroll all the way down the page to find it:\n\nWorld News Daily Report assumes all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website - even those based on real people - are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.\n\nIt is run by Janick Murray-Hall and Olivier Legault, who also run the satirical Journal de Mourr\u00e9al, a satirical site spoofing the (real) Journal de Mont\u00e9al. Very often their stories feature an image showing a random crazy mugshot found in a mugshot gallery on the internet or on a stock photo website superimposed over a background of flashing police lights or crime scene tape.\n\nArticles from the site are frequently copied (sometimes even months or years later) by varous fake news websites that omit the satire disclaimer and present the information as real.\n\nWe wrote about worldnewsdailyreport.com before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Grandparents Did NOT Sue Hypnotherapist After He Failed to Turn Grandson Heterosexual\n\u2022 Fake News: Chicago Man Did NOT Pose as Doctor, Did NOT Perform Colonoscopies, Genital Exams on Patients\n\u2022 Fake News: British Man NOT Suffering From Rare Medical Condition, Does NOT Defecate Through His Mouth", "lang": "en"}
