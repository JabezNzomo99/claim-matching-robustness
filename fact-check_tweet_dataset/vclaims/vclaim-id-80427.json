The confusion stemmed from a resolution moved in the Senate of Pakistan by senator Khaleeda Parveen on February 16, 2018. The resolution recommended providing Mandarin courses for current and future Pakistani CPEC staff. CPEC stands for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. It includes areas ranging from infrastructure to information technology projects that are currently being developed in Pakistan.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the resolution that was to be discussed on Monday from a document tilted 'Senate Secretariat Orders Of The Day' that BOOM was easily able to find. (Click here to view the entire link)\n\nHere 'courses of the Official Chinese Language should be launched' was misinterpreted and misreported as making \"Chinese\" language official.\n\nThe resolution was passed on February 19 . A website named CPEC Info which provides information on CPEC activities said the classes were a joint initiative of the Pakistan-China Institute (PCI) and the JS Group.\n\nThe misinformation began with a tweet from Pakistan's Abb Takk; a local television channel with a verified Twitter handle. Abb Takk's tweet incorrectly stated that (Pakistan's) 'Senate Approves Motion to Declare Chinese as Official Language.'\n\nThis was promptly lapped up by journalists across the border in India. Caustic comments were made about the diplomatic ties between Beijing and Islamabad.\n\nWires news agency ANI, wrote an entire story citing Abb Takk. ANI's story also included a tweet by Pakistan's former ambassador to the United States, who took Abb Takk's tweet as the final word.\n\nIndian news organisations line News18 , Republic TV, Times Now, Zee News , IndiaToday; Financial Express , DNA and Outlook picked up the story based on ANI's report.", "lang": "en"}
