Tim Huelskamp is a tea party favorite who has long been a skeptic of the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, but his recent remarks during a swing of town halls jumped out at The Fact Checker. He referred to \u201cnumbers\u201d that showed that, even after all the hoopla about 8 million Americans enrolling on the exchanges, the number of uninsured in Kansas has actually risen since the law went into effect.\n\nWe waited a few days for an answer from Huelskamp\u2019s staff. Jamie Jackson, his spokesman, told The Fact Checker he was looking for numbers, but then did not provide them. (Update: Twelve hours after this column appeared, Huelskamp released a statement, which is reprinted in full below, with some commentary.)\n\nScott C. Brunner, senior analyst at the Kansas Health Institute, which closely studies health data in the state, said the most recent figures available are for 2012, courtesy of the Census Bureau. \u201cWe are in the dark until Census releases the data for 2013,\u201d he said, adding that even that data set would not cover the entire enrollment period that ended in April.\n\nBrunner said the difference between 2011 and 2012 is so small that it effectively could stem from sampling error. He also noted that the percentage of the uninsured is the more relevant number over time, as it could account for any increase in the raw numbers that resulted from population growth.\n\nAs of March 1, meanwhile, 29,309 Kansans had signed up for health care on the federal exchanges, with 78 percent qualifying for a federal subsidy, according the Department of Health and Human Services. The data are more murky on Medicaid enrollment \u2014 Kansas did not agree to expand the program \u2014 but that could add another 10,000 or so people to the insurance rolls.\n\nOf course, it is still not clear what percentage of enrollees in exchange plans will end up making payments \u2014 85 or 90 percent is an accepted estimate \u2014 but these numbers also do not include the huge surge at the end of the enrollment period. Even if just 15,000 turn out to be previously uninsured, that would cut the uninsured rate by three-fourths of a percentage point.\n\nFor instance, Blue Cross Blue Shield, the largest carrier in Kansas, initially sent 10,000 letters of cancellation but then withdrew them after the Obama administration offered a fix that would allow people to keep noncompliant plans, according to Linda J. Sheppard, director of health care policy and analysis at the Kansas Insurance Department. Other companies also allowed customers to keep their plans, and the state announced in March that the extension would continue until 2016.\n\nMembers of Congress have a responsibility to be factual and accurate, especially when speaking to constituents about federal policies. But as far as we can tell, in at least two instances Huelskamp simply invented his claim that \u201cnumbers\u201d exist showing that \u201cthere are more people uninsured today in Kansas\u201d since the health-care law was implemented. Not only are there no up-to-date data, but the available figures concerning young adults and exchange enrollments provide good evidence that the law has led to a decrease in the number of uninsured.\n\nFact #1: Obama\u2019s own Census Bureau reports that in 2010, 349,745 persons were uninsured in Kansas. The same report, for the last year they provide data, admits 358,399 were uninsured. This is an increase of approximately 8,000 uninsured Kansans. (Note from the Fact Checker: This is a slightly different Census document than cited above but even this document says the percentage of the uninsured remained unchanged from 2010 to 2012\u201312.6 percent. The health-care law did not get fully implemented until 2013.)\n\nFact #4: The Obama Administration refuses to release any numbers of individuals who have enrolled in ObamaCare and actually paid their premiums, nor the numbers of Kansans who lost the health insurance plan that Obama promised they could keep, nor the number of Kansans who have seen significant increases in their premiums, their deductibles, lost access to the doctor they like, or any combination thereof.", "lang": "en"}
