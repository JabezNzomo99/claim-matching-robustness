Together, the posts have been viewed more than 1.2 million times since the first one was posted around 22 March 2020.\n\nThe video makes a long list of claims\u2014some true and some false\u2014which have circulated repeatedly since the pandemic began. We address each of those claims here.\n\u2022 \u201cIf you have a runny nose and sputum, you have a common cold. Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose.\u201d\n\nInaccurate: Runny nose and sputum are indeed symptoms of the common cold, but these same symptoms have been observed in some patients with COVID-19. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), \u201cThe most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, or diarrhea.\u201d The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) adds \u201cshortness of breath\u201d to the list of most common COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible for a person to become infected with more than one virus at the same time, such as influenza A[1]. Therefore, the presence of symptoms that are more common to other infections absolutely does not indicate the absence of infection by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\u2022 \u201cThis new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of just 26-27 degrees. It hates the sun.\u201d\n\nUnsupported: It is unclear whether the video is referring to the Celsius (C) or Fahrenheit (F) temperature scale. However, considering that both temperatures are below the average temperature of the human body (37\u00b0C or 98.6\u00b0F), this statement is illogical. If it were true, people would not become infected with SARS-CoV-2 by simple virtue of having a higher body temperature than the virus could withstand.\n\nThe WHO states in its \u201cMyth busters\u201d post: \u201cYou can catch COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is. Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19.\u201d\n\nThere is indeed some evidence that the sun can destroy certain viruses[2] and bacteria[3] in the environment. However, there is currently no evidence that the sun has the same effect on SARS-CoV-2, as previously reported by PolitiFact. CDC physician and researcher Nancy Messionnier told PolitiFact that \u201c\u2019it\u2019s premature to assume\u2019 the heat and sunlight will temper the virus.\u201d And even if it turns out to be true that the sun could deactivate the virus, the amount of time it would take for this to happen is unlikely to be instantaneous, leaving a window of opportunity for infection even from sun-exposed surfaces. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to use proper handwashing technique, as described by the CDC, after touching communal surfaces outside your home.\n\u2022 \u201cIf someone sneezes with it, it takes about 10 feet before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne.\u201d\n\nPartially Correct: According to the WHO, \u201cCOVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes. In an analysis of 75,465 COVID-19 cases in China, airborne transmission was not reported.\u201d\n\nDroplets containing the virus cannot travel as far as airborne infectious particles. Therefore, the WHO recommends maintaining a minimum safe distance between self and others of three feet (1m), whereas the CDC recommends a distance of six feet (2m). The 10-foot distance recommended in the video may not be absolutely necessary, but it also couldn\u2019t hurt.\n\nThe two health organizations base their recommendations on this concept, stated by the WHO: \u201cDroplet transmission occurs when a person is in close contact (within 1 m) with someone who has respiratory symptoms (e.g., coughing or sneezing) and is therefore at risk of having his/her mucosae (mouth and nose) or conjunctiva (eyes) exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets. [\u2026] transmission of the COVID-19 virus can occur by direct contact with infected people and indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects used on the infected person (e.g., stethoscope or thermometer).\u201d\n\nAs of early April 2020, however, research has begun to emerge indicating that the virus might also be airborne:[5]\n\nDue to the unknown potential of airborne particles to be infectious, the CDC began recommending that all persons in the U.S. wear cloth face masks in public.\n\u2022 \u201cIf it drops on a metal surface, it will live for at least 12 hours\u2014so if you come into contact with any metal surface, wash your hands as soon as you can with a bacterial soap.\u201d\n\nAccurate: The virus causing COVID-19 has indeed been identified on different types of surfaces for hours or even days, as Health Feedback previously reported. But it remains unknown how long the virus remains infectious on these surfaces and how likely it is for a person to become infected by touching them. Therefore, again, it is important to follow the prevention guidelines listed above, which are provided by reputable health agencies such as the WHO and CDC.\n\nHandwashing for at least 20 seconds, or using hand sanitizer made of at least 60% alcohol when soap is not available, is an effective way to kill microbes on the skin. In the case of COVID-19, any soap will do because it destroys the lipid-based capsule that surrounds and protects the virus, leaving it exposed to degradation.\n\nAntibacterial soaps are not harmful, but are also not more effective than regular soap since viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 are not destroyed by antibacterial agents. Presumably, the claim meant to refer to antibacterial soap instead of \u201cbacterial\u201d soap. Health Feedback is not aware that such a product exists and it seems unlikely that one would ever be produced.\n\u2022 \u201cOn fabric it can survive for 6-12 hours. Normal laundry detergent will kill it.\u201d\n\nAccurate: Yes, normal laundry detergent will kill the virus on fabric. The CDC states: \u201cIn general, using a normal laundry detergent according to washing machine instructions and dry thoroughly using the warmest temperatures recommended on the clothing label.\u201d The virus has been detected on fabric for as long as a day, as previously reported by Health Feedback, but it is still not known whether the virus remains infectious after this length of time.\n\u2022 \u201cDrinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink liquids with ice. You should also gargle as a prevention. A simple solution of salt in warm water will suffice.\u201d\n\nMisleading: Drinking warm water or gargling salt water might soothe a sore throat, but it will not cure the virus or prevent infection, as previously reported by Health Feedback. There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that cold liquids are harmful.\n\u2022 \u201cWash your hands frequently as the virus can only live on your hands for 5-10 minutes, but a lot can happen during that time\u2014you can rub your eyes, pick your nose unwittingly and so on.\u201d\n\nCorrect: It is unknown how long SARS-CoV-2 can survive on skin. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say it stays long enough to spread from person to person,\u201d said Mobeen H. Rathore, chief of pediatric infectious diseases and immunology at Wolfson Children\u2019s Hospital of Jacksonville, Florida, to HuffPost.\n\nAgain, because the virus\u2019 survival on skin is unknown, it is important to follow the aforementioned handwashing guidelines.\n\u2022 It will first infect the throat, so you\u2019ll have a sore throat lasting 3-4 days.\n\u2022 The virus then blends into a nasal fluid that enters the trachea and then the lungs, causing pneumonia. This takes about 5-6 days further.\n\u2022 With the pneumonia comes high fever and difficulty in breathing.\n\u2022 The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind. You feel like you\u2019re drowning. It\u2019s imperative you then seek immediate attention.\u201d\n\nIncorrect: The virus does not always infect the throat first, as previously reported by Health Feedback. And there is no evidence to suggest that it remains isolated in one particular part of the body for any specific length of time. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 does not cause pneumonia in all infected individuals. In fact, as many as 25% of people will never experience any symptoms at all, but are still capable of passing the virus to others.\n\nHigh fever and shortness of breath are indeed possible, but not guaranteed, symptoms of COVID-19. Some individuals only realize they have contracted the disease after losing their sense of taste and smell without experiencing any other symptoms.\n\nMany physicians and hospitals are urging patients to not rush to the emergency room at the first sign of COVID-19 symptoms. Because if a person is experiencing only mild symptoms, they can be effectively treated at home without exposing other sick patients in the emergency room to contagion. Rather, many physicians recommend first calling their primary care doctor for advice. The CDC provides a handy \u201cCoronavirus Self Checker\u201d to help people evaluate their own symptoms and to determine when to seek appropriate medical care.\n\u2022 \u201cThe new coronavirus may not show sign of infection for many days. By the time they have fever and/or cough and go to the hospital, the lung is usually 50% fibrosis and it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nMostly inaccurate: It is true that by the time a person begins experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, the virus has already been spreading within the body for 1 to 14 days\u2014the virus\u2019 incubation period, as previously reported by Health Feedback. However, it is not \u201ctoo late\u201d to seek medical attention by the time symptoms appear.\n\nAccording to a 30 March study published in the Lancet[4], the case fatality rate for COVID-19\u2014that is the proportion of deaths out of the total number of diagnosed cases\u2014is only 1.4% averaged across all age groups. And when the researchers factored in their estimates of undiagnosed and asymptomatic cases, this rate fell to only 0.66%. Although death from COVID-19 infection is still much higher than that for influenza (0.1%), and mortality rates begin to rise steeply for individuals ages 60 and above, the chances of surviving infection for most individuals are quite good.\n\nThe claim that the lung will have developed \u201c50% fibrosis\u201d by the time fever or cough develop, was previously debunked by Reuters, which cites an interview with Thomas Nash, an internist, pulmonologist, and infectious disease specialist at New York Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. Nash called the phrase a \u201cnon-medical concept.\u201d He also pointed out that pulmonary (lung) \u201cfibrosis takes months if not years to develop\u201d, not the mere days mentioned in the claim.\n\u2022 \u201cExperts provide a simple self-check that we can do every morning. Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you complete it successfully without coughing, without discomfort, stiffness or tightness, etc., it proves there is no fibrosis in the lungs, basically indicates no infection.\u201d\n\nIncorrect: Holding your breath for 10 seconds is not a valid test for COVID-19. This claim has been debunked by Snopes and AFP Fact Check, among others.\u201d\n\nAgain, individuals concerned that they may have developed COVID-19 should consult their primary care physician for advice or refer to the CDC\u2019s \u201cCoronavirus Self Checker\u201d to identify their symptoms and determine when to seek appropriate medical care.\n\u2022 \u201cTake a few sips of water every 15 minutes at least. Why? Even if the virus gets into your mouth, drinking water or other liquids will wash them down through your throat and into the stomach. Once there, your stomach acid will kill all the virus. If you don\u2019t drink enough water more regularly, the virus can enter your windpipe and into the lungs.\u201d\n\nInaccurate: Drinking water frequently will not wash the virus away into the stomach where it will be destroyed by stomach acids. In fact, certain cells within the gastrointestinal tract possess the same ACE2 receptors that SARS-CoV-2 uses to target and infect cells of the respiratory tract. This claim was previously debunked by both the BBC and AAP FactCheck.\n\nIn summary, most of the claims listed above regarding methods for diagnosing, treating, preventing, or curing COVID-19 are inaccurate. There is currently no effective cure or treatment for COVID-19, although many are being investigated in clinical trials. In the meantime, individuals should continue to follow the basic, well-tested precautionary measures such as frequent handwashing, disinfecting surfaces, avoiding touching the face, social distancing, and self-isolation when sick in order to prevent infection. And to seek medical advice from a trusted physician about when to seek treatment outside of the home.\n\nSee a list of all coronavirus-related reviews written by Health Feedback here.\n\nThe WHO also provides a frequently-updated list of busted myths about the coronavirus here.\n\nUPDATE (8 Apr. 2020):\n\n This review was updated based on expert consultation from the National Research Council about the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 might be airborne[5].\n\u2022 None Co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus in patient with pneumonia, China\n\u2022 None Predicted inactivation of viruses of relevance to biodefense by solar radiation\n\u2022 None Estimates of the severity of coronavirus disease 2019: a model-based analysis\n\u2022 None Rapid Expert Consultation on the Possibility of Bioaerosol Spread of SARS-CoV-2 for the COVID-19 Pandemic (April 1, 2020).
