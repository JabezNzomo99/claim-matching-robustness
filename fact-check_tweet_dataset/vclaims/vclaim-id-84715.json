The government said that no children died from a coronavirus vaccine.\n\nIn another viral post shared around Africa, an illustration shows a black woman brandishing a machete to a white doctor holding an injection, while pictures circulating in English and French show a syringe with text reading \u201cNo vaccine test in Africa\u201d.\n\nElsewhere in West Africa, a Facebook post shared thousands of times warned against a \u201cBill Gates\u201d vaccine, after the billionaire Microsoft founder pledged $250 million to the COVID-19 response.\n\nThe message circulating in Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Benin falsely claimed that French doctor Didier Raoult -- who promotes malaria drug chloroquine as a possible treatment -- said that the vaccine \"contains poison\u201d and that \u201cthe West wants to destroy Africa\".\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has flagged earning public trust as an urgent health challenge and warned of an \u201cinfodemic\u201d -- a deluge of information, including misinformation on social media -- that is hampering the COVID-19 response.\n\nThe body says concerns that Africa could be abused as a vaccine testing ground are unfounded.\n\n\u201cI would really reassure people that the clinical trials currently ongoing on the continent respect international standards and follow the same protocol as other developed countries,\u201d Richard Mihigo, Programme Area Manager for Immunisation and Vaccine Development for the World Health Organization in Africa, told AFP.\n\nThere are more than 100 candidate vaccines in development around the world, with eight candidates already being tested in human trials.\n\nOne such drug developed by Britain\u2019s Oxford University was hit by misinformation last month when a widely-shared South African news article claimed that a woman taking part in trials died shortly after being given the vaccine. The volunteer, Elisa Granato, later told reporters she was \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d.\n\nBuilding trust around vaccines is a difficult task, not least in a continent with a dark history of abuse at the hands of white doctors.\n\nIn South Africa, memories are still raw of the infamous \u201cDr Death\u201d, who headed the apartheid regime\u2019s biological warfare programme in the 1980s and early 1990s. Wouter Basson worked on a plan to sterilise black South Africans, involving a substance -- never developed -- which could have been dispensed through vaccinations.\n\nIn Nigeria, pharma giant Pfizer was sued after 11 children died in a meningitis trial in 1996. The families\u2019 lawyer claimed they could not have given proper consent as they did not speak English.\n\nAnd around the continent, cases of fraudulent HIV cures have \u201cfuelled strong distrust in politicians and some scientists\u201d, Keymanthri Moodley from Stellenbosch University said.\n\nMeanwhile, a viral post shared on Facebook and Twitter in recent weeks refers to a US government experiment that started in the 1930s and saw health workers withhold treatment from black men with syphilis to study the disease. In 40 years, 28 of the test subjects died of syphilis and another 100 died of complications.\n\n\"US government offers free healthcare to southern rural blacks. Intentionally injects them with syphilis. Still want a corona vaccine?\" the post reads, next to a photograph of black men in flat caps and dungarees waiting to be seen by white health workers.\n\n\u201cRather than dismissing these as \u2018false rumours\u2019 or \u2018erroneous beliefs\u2019, these concerns should be heard and recognised,\u201d Sara Cooper, senior scientist at the South African Medical Research Council told AFP.\n\nShe said ethical research led by African scientists rather than by \u201ctop-down\u201d foreign programmes could \u201cgo a long way in rebuilding community trust and reducing resistance\u201d.\n\nWhile anti-vaccine sentiment is thriving globally, including in Britain and the United States, some African countries have seen an explosion of online promotion of COVID-19 herbal cures that scientists warn are baseless.\n\nEating onions and garlic, sipping lemon water and even drinking urine are some of dozens of natural remedies being touted as virus fixes in Africa.\n\nIn Madagascar, President Andry Rajoelina last month unveiled a herbal tea remedy prepared with artemisia, a plant with proven efficacy in malaria treatment. Soldiers have been going door to door to hand out the drink in the capital Antananarivo, while a growing number of West African countries have taken deliveries.\n\n\u201cThis herbal tea gives results in seven days,\u201d he said as he sipped a dose at the official launch.\n\nSuch claims fly in the face of warnings from international scientists who say there is currently no known cure for the new coronavirus and urge rigorous testing to prove the effectiveness and safety of the proposed traditional cures.\n\nDespite the problems of perception, the WHO's Mihigo was optimistic that when a coronavirus vaccine becomes available, it would be widely accepted in Africa.\n\n\u201cCommunities know very well that when immunisation is not given, outbreaks do occur. We\u2019ve seen that with measles,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople turn up overwhelmingly to vaccination campaigns. They know the benefits. They\u2019ve seen people dying.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
