Furthermore, the main catalyst for the negotiations has been the uncertainty caused by Donald Trump\u2019s vow to renegotiate NAFTA rather than his plans to build a border wall.\n\nThe source cited by \u201cThe Other 98%\u201d is a September 2017 article by Daily Kos, which reported:\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what the source of these claims is, but a similar meme appeared online earlier in 2017, which read:\n\n\u201cMade in America Week\u201d took place from 17-24 July 2017; we found no evidence of any deal between Mexico and Argentina being announced during that time period. However, talks have been ongoing between the two countries.\n\nIn the spring of 2017, Mexico\u2019s Deputy Economy Minister Juan Carlos Baker made several comments in interviews about his country\u2019s negotiations with Argentina and Brazil. On 26 March 2017, the Financial Times reported:\n\nThe following month, Baker told Reuters that a deal with Argentina could be finalized by the end of 2017:\n\nMexico, seeking closer ties with the rest of Latin America, expects to finish negotiations on a trade deal with Argentina involving cars and agricultural products around the end of the year, Mexico\u2019s deputy minister for foreign trade said in an interview on Tuesday. Under the deal, Argentina could gain part of the lucrative grains market in Mexico, Latin America\u2019s No. 2 economy, Baker told Reuters. In 2015 Mexico imported $2.3 billion worth of U.S. corn and $1.4 billion of U.S. soy. But Baker said those numbers will likely decrease under a renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement called for by Trump. \u201cThe potential is there,\u201d Baker said. \u201cThe Argentine exporters could find attractive conditions in Mexico.\u201d Mexico, in turn, could export cars to Argentina, he said. \u201cWe have a very strong manufacturing industry and Argentina is an important market for us,\u201d Baker said.\n\nA trade deal between Mexico and Argentina may be in the works, but it has not yet been announced as of 1 November 2017. However, assuming a deal goes ahead to shift Mexico\u2019s importation of certain products from the United States to Argentina, the numbers are significant \u2014 but not as dramatic as they are in the meme.\n\nAccording to United States Grain Council statistics, the United States exported $2.5 billion worth of corn to Mexico in 2015 and 2016. In 2015, the United States exported $2.9 billion worth of soy products to Mexico, according to the U.S. Soybean Export Council (page 19.) According to Global Agricultural Trade System statistics for 2016, exports of wheat and rice were worth $612 million and $274 million, respectively.\n\nThis yields a total of $6.3 billion in U.S. exports to Mexico of corn, rice, wheat and soy \u2014 the four products specified in the above meme. So even if Mexico did decide to stop importing all these products from the U.S., the likely annual financial cost to the American agriculture industry would be extremely significant, but still only around half the $13 billion claimed.\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear where the figure of $13 billion came from, but it might have originated in an October 2017 letter sent to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and signed by dozens of food and agriculture companies and industry associations, warning Ross about the dangers, as they see them, of withdrawing from NAFTA.\n\nThe study mentioned here was an August 2017 working paper produced by the economic consulting firm ImpactECON. It did not actually mention any figure of $13 billion. Rather, it projected that over the course of two to three years after a U.S. withdrawal from NAFTA, real GDP in the United States would fall by as much as 0.09 percent.\n\nGross domestic product, or GDP, is the combined market value of all goods and services produced in a particular geographic area (in this case, the United States.) It is a calculation commonly used to measure the total size of an economy. Real GDP is gross domestic product adjusted for inflation \u2013 meaning, roughly speaking, the size of the economy in relation to the cost of living.\n\nAs of the third quarter of 2017 (when the ImpactECON report was published), the real GDP of the United States was $17.01 trillion, according to figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. A 0.09 percent decline in that would amount to a $15.3 billion loss \u2014 not far off the $13 billion posited by the food and agriculture industry, in their letter.\n\nThere are a couple of things to note here: firstly, the 0.09 percent decline estimated in the ImpactECON report relates to the entire U.S. economy, and not \u201cthe farm sector alone,\u201d as mentioned in the letter.\n\nIn fact, the working paper projects a very small increase in production for the crops and forestry sector (0.04 percent, page 20), accompanied by a significant boost to production in the sugar sector (5.11 percent), but it also projects production declines of between one and two percent in the meat, food and livestock and fishing sectors.\n\nSecondly, this real GDP declined is projected to happen \u201cin the next 2-3 years\u201d, so if the meme is using the letter to Wilbur Ross as the source of its $13 billion figure, it is misrepresenting the decline as happening \u201cannually.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
