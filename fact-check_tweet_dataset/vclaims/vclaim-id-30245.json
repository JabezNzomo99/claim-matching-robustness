We found the same video shared by a Twitter user,Aviator Anil Chopra, with the message, \u201cThe greatest temporary spectacle on earth, peaceful and orderly for such a great mass of humanity. Incredible Indian civilisation. #Kumbh2019\u201c. It was posted on March 7, 2019.\n\nThe reverse image search also led us to a March 11, 2019 Facebook post by one Suresh Kumar, where the video is accompanied with the caption, \u201cKumbh Mela Naga sadhu\u201d.\n\nKumbh Mela was celebrated from January 15 to March 4 last year and saw a footfall of over a million pilgrims. The video, however, was also uploaded with a different description on YouTube. A channel uploaded the clip on March 3, 2019, with the caption, \u201cJunaghad Naga bava\u201d suggesting that the video pertains to Mahashivratri. This festival fell on March 4 last year. While the origin of the video could not be independently established, needless to say, it has nothing to do with the Citizenship Amendment Act as it existed on the internet as early as March 3, 2019, which is months before CAA was passed in December 2019.", "lang": "en"}
