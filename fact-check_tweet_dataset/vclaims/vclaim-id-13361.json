It also doesn\u2019t reflect what some people actually take home in their pay packets as it excludes bonuses.\n\nThere are four main ways of measuring what\u2019s happening to wages. You can look at the growth in regular pay (which is pay not counting any bonuses), or you can look at the growth in total pay (which includes bonuses). Both of these measures can then be considered with or without adjusting for inflation, to give a total of four figures. They are all valid ways of describing wage growth\u2014but they can often tell quite different stories.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics Figures publishes figures each month for all four measures of the growth in average weekly earnings in Great Britain.\n\nThree years ago total pay was rising by around 2% to 3% annually, but inflation was also close to zero, meaning that real-terms pay was also increasing by 2% to 3% annually.\n\nIn recent months pay has been growing at a similar pace, but inflation has also been at around 2%, meaning that the real terms total pay growth is much lower. It was 0.8% in September 2018.\n\nAll these figures refer to wage growth in Great Britain and so exclude Northern Ireland. They also refer to a three month average\u2014for example figures in September 2018 compare how quickly wages have grown on average between July and September 2018 with the same period the year before.\n\nData for the whole of the UK is published annually. This data can\u2019t show detailed monthly trends, but shows that in April 2018 median full-time weekly earnings grew by 1.2% in real terms compared to a year earlier. That\u2018s the highest it\u2019s been since April 2016.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve heard this kind of claim from the Prime Minister or other senior government figures recently (although it\u2019s the first time we can recall it\u2019s erroneously been described as \u201creal wages\u201d).\n\nOn 14 November, the day before this latest claim, Mrs May said in parliament that the figures showed \u201cthe fastest regular wage growth in nearly a decade\u201d (which is why we suspect that she meant to say the same thing a day later), and on 17 October she said that they showed \u201cwages rising faster than at any time in a decade\u201d.\n\nThe Chancellor made the same claim in Parliament on 6 November, Work and Pensions minister Alok Sharma said it on 14 November, and Financial Secretary to the Treasury Mel Stride said it on 19 November. We\u2019ve also seen variants of the claim in social media posts over recent weeks from Health and Social Care minister Matt Hancock, Guto Bebb, Rory Stewart, Jake Berry and the Conservative party\u2019s official Facebook account.\n\nThese claims are all broadly correct if you look regular pay not adjusted for inflation.\n\nBut as we\u2019ve said on this issue before, because this measure doesn\u2019t reflect people\u2019s total take-home pay and doesn\u2019t account for rising prices, it\u2019s perhaps the least helpful of the four measures for reflecting the impact people will feel from changes in their pay.", "lang": "en"}
