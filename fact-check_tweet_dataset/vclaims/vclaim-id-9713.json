{"title": "Lorries at Dover", "subtitle": "The Port of Dover has previously said that between 1% and 3% of lorries arriving at Dover are not from the EU, but we haven\u2019t been able to confirm the source of the figure.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-9713", "url": "https://fullfact.org/europe/lorries-dover/", "vclaim": "\u201cThere are other lorries, as you will know better than I do, that are not going to the EU. In fact I think it is 2% or 3% of those coming through Dover and they take a lot longer [to be checked]. And that is the reality, if you don\u2019t have a Customs Union there will be queues.\u201d\n\nKeir Starmer told us that he was briefed on these figures on a visit to the Port of Dover. The Port of Dover told us it was unable to verify the figure.\n\nThe Port of Dover has provided, or been cited as the source of, similar numbers in the past. In October last year it told a committee of MPs: \u201cCurrently, just 1% of our freight vehicle traffic is non-EU\u201d, and the Port\u2019s Chairman told another committee that \u201cbetween 1% and 2%\u201d of freight trucks arriving at Dover are non-EU. A think tank also cited the Port authorities as its source when stating that \u201clorry-loads of goods entering Dover from outside the EU\u201d make up \u201caround 3% of the total\u201d.\n\nThese figures seem to all refer to lorries entering the UK at Dover, while Keir Starmer seems to be referring to lorries exiting the UK. We\u2019ve not found any published statistics which look at lorries entering or leaving Dover broken down by whether or not an EU country was their origin or destination.\n\nWe\u2019ve asked the Port of Dover for more information about the figures attributed to it.\n\nProcessing lorries from the rest of the EU\n\nThe Port of Dover says EU lorries are processed in around two minutes, whereas it takes around 20 minutes to clear non-EU lorries. Other evidence given to a committee of MPs suggests it can sometimes take longer for non-EU lorries.\n\nThe Institute for Government told us that a lorry from a non-EU country would still have to undergo some customs checks at Dover, even if it had passed through another EU country first. This is because even if the lorry enters the EU customs union before arriving in the UK, it won\u2019t undergo full customs checks until it reaches its final destination, under EU regulations.\n\nMost EU lorries don\u2019t undergo customs checks when they arrive in the UK, as we\u2019re part of the customs union. When the UK leaves the EU, the government has said it is \u201cclear\u201d we are also leaving the customs union.\n\nThe Port of Dover suggested to MPs that, after Brexit \u201cAll goods will have to be checked somewhere\u201d. What eventually happens will depend on the final deal agreed between the UK and the rest of the EU.\n\nWhat might new customs checks look like?\n\nThe Port of Dover says that it has no additional space to carry out an increased number of checks. It adds that, in order to avoid long queues at the Port after Brexit, checks will have to be conducted away from the Port.\n\nThe Institute for Government says that what customs checks look like after Brexit is still uncertain and dependent on the on the final outcome of any deal negotiated between the UK and the rest of the EU.\n\nIt notes that \u201cTo scale [existing customs clearance] organisations up to the point where they have the capacity to manage 100% of trade would require new systems, staff and infrastructure.\u201d\n\nThe government has said that it doesn\u2019t want a hard border at the port that requires every lorry to be stopped.", "lang": "en"}
