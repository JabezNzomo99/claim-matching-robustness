Unfortunately, the answer is no, I could not. I cringe at the thought of today, of the regulations, the challenges that small businesses face.\u201d Or, as he put it in a newsletter to constituents: \u201cIt reminded me of when I operated Kevin O\u2019s Deli, where I experienced one of the greatest challenges to running a small business: overregulation by government.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy says he refinanced his car, \u201ctaking cash everywhere I could,\u201d to buy the refrigerator, the slicer and other items before the opening. He also made payments on an icemaker because he wanted \u201cspecial ice.\u201d He says he paid rent for the space from his cousin, which was the suite next to the yogurt shop in a shopping strip. He said the deli had its own rear exit, for deliveries, and a wall was removed between the two suites to open up the space to the yogurt shop. That way, his customers could use the tables and chairs in the yogurt shop.", "lang": "en"}
