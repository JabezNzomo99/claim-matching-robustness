The FIR states that Chaudhary has been booked for \u201cmaligning the Muslim community in a programme called DNA broadcast on 11.03.2020 on Zee News\u201d. In another tweet, Chaudhary wrote that the FIR is the \u201cprize for daring to speak against #ZameenJihad in Jammu, #LoveJihad in Kerala\u2026\u201d\n\nThe FIR concerns Chaudhary\u2019s Match 11 broadcast where he indulged in a five-minute discourse on \u201cdifferent types of jihad\u201d during his DNA show. \u201cToday we have a diagram about jihad which I want read out to you so that you can understand what the conspiracy is.\u201d Chaudhary then went on to describe \u2018hard\u2019 and \u2018soft\u2019 Jihad in detail. With the help of the diagram, he explained history jihad, media jihad, love jihad, movie jihad, population jihad, land jihad, etc.\n\nThe FIR was registered at Kasaba police station on April 24 by advocate P Gavas, AIYF state joint secretary, Kozhikode. Chaudhary has been booked under Section 295A of the Indian Penal Code (Deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage reli\u00adgious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or reli\u00adgious beliefs).\n\nGavas shared his complaint with Alt News which states, \u201cSudhir Chaudhary, the head and editor-in-chief of Zee News covered the different types of jihad organized by Muslims in India. He used a diagram to target the Muslims of India\u2026He made comments during the show that can create religious hate amongst people and lead to communal riots. \u201d The complaint also carries the Malayalam translation of the March 11 show on the \u201cdifferent types of jihad\u201d.\n\nIronically, Zee News had plagiarized the chart from a dodgy Facebook page. The image was traced by Newslaundry to a five-year-old post by the page \u2018Boycott Halal in India\u2019. The Facebook page goes on to a detailed explanation of how \u2018Halal\u2019 is an example of economic jihad.\n\nAlt News found that the image was even older than August 1, 2015, when it was posted on the \u2018Boycott Halal\u2019 page. It carried the watermark of a now-deleted Facebook page called \u2018Secularism ki topi\u2019. The chart also features on a 2015 post of blog called sickular.com which is dedicated to propaganda against minorities. The image has been in circulation since 2014 and has been shared by many Facebook and Twitter users with the same Islamophobic narrative for which it was created. Below is a tweet by BJP supporter Payal Rohatgi from September 2019.\n\nThe chart seemed to be circulation before it made into Zee News newsroom, as can be seen from this March 1, 2020 tweet.\n\nInterestingly, in the DNA show, before presenting the \u2018jihad\u2019 poster, Sudhir Chaudhary also featured the views of Pakistani-Canadian author Tarek Fatah, who is known for his frequent targeting of Indian Muslims with false information. Fatah was presented by Zee News as \u201cIslam ke jaankaar\u201d, which can be translated as \u2018one knowledgeable about Islam\u2019.\n\nFollowing the outrage about the jihad chart, Chaudhary went on to defend his show and indulged in name-calling his critics as \u2018designer patrakar\u2019 and \u2018tukde-tukde gang\u2019.\n\nTo defend his jihad chart, he tried to explain a concept he called \u2018Gajwa-e-Hind\u2019, quoting from the book of the controversial American anti-Muslim author and blogger, Robert Spencer. All through his explanation, Chaudhary repeated several times that he was not targeting any particular religion but rather those who hold unholy ideas of dividing the country.\n\nIncidentally, Chaudhary, who blatantly plagiarized the jihad chart from a dubious Facebook page had once made a plagiarism charge against TMC MP Mahua Moitra. Not only was the charge false but the man who he accused Moitra of plagiarizing, came to her defence and slammed Chaudhary\u2019s allegations.\n\nMoitra had filed charges of criminal defamation against Chaudhary.\n\nAt a time when the country witnessed deadly communal riots in the capital which caused close to 50 deaths, Zee News dedicated an entire show to different types of \u2018jihad\u2019 \u2013 a derogatory word coined to fan anti-Muslim sentiments. This wasn\u2019t just irresponsible journalism but a blatant misuse of public emotion which was at an all-time high. The show was nothing more than sectarian propaganda to drive views. Now that a police complaint has been filed against Sudhir Chaudhary, the anchor is playing the victim by portraying that the FIR is a \u201cprize\u201d for speaking the truth.", "lang": "en"}
