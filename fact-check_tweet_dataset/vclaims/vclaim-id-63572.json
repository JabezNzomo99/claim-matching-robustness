Actually, many police vehicles in Minneapolis have that license plate.\n\nThe death of George Floyd \u2014 which came after a police officer kneeled on his neck, an incident that was captured on cellphone video \u2014 has sparked strong reactions. In some corners of the internet, those reactions have become conspiracy theories.\n\nOne such conspiracy theory claims that the incident was a \u201cfalse flag,\u201d which means that it was a planned event intended to hide the identity of the group that actually carried it out. The primary piece of evidence for this theory is that the police vehicle shown in the video of actions that led up to Floyd\u2019s death has a license plate that reads, \u201cPOLICE.\u201d\n\nA popular screenshot meme spreading this theory on Facebook says: \u201cPolice PLATES dont say POLICE.\u201d\n\nBut in Minneapolis, they do.\n\nPictures from the Minneapolis Police Department\u2019s Facebook page and media coverage over the years show that many official vehicles for the department have license plates that bear the word \u201cPOLICE.\u201d\n\nUnder Minnesota state law, police vehicles that are clearly marked are not required to display numbered license plates.\n\nThe claim about the plates appears to have originated on a Twitter account that refers in its bio to QAnon, a wide-ranging conspiracy theory that holds President Donald Trump as a champion against the so-called \u201cdeep state.\u201d\n\nThat account deleted the original tweet, explaining, \u201cIm taking this down because or the Plate theory being inacurate and the rest of the statementa not being answered.\u201d\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t stopped others from circulating a screenshot of the original tweet as a meme on Facebook, where it\u2019s been shared with comments such as, \u201cIndeed. An assassination staged as police brutality in order to destroy law and order, frame the Police Department, and \u2018become ungovernable\u2019 in order to usher in Anarchy and FORCE a Civil War\u2026 #FalseFlag.\u201d\n\nNot only that, but this bogus claim that has been retracted by the original poster is also getting wrapped up with other similarly flawed conspiracy theories about Floyd\u2019s death.\n\nThese \u201cfalse flag\u201d claims often circulate online following national tragedies. We debunked similar claims after James Alex Fields Jr. drove his car into a crowd demonstrating in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing Heather Heyer, and after Stephen Craig Paddock opened fire on more than 22,000 people attending an outdoor concert in Las Vegas.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
