Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: The ABP news channel has telecasted Rahul Gandhi\u2019s comments, who said that he and his ancestors are Muslims, and his party belongs to Muslims. Fact: The ABP news channel \u2018Breaking News\u2019 in the image is photoshopped. The font used by the ABP in its \u2018Breaking News\u2019 template is different from the font in the posted image. Also, the ABP news channel itself had debunked one of the quotes. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen searched if ABP news channel has telecasted any such comments attributed to Rahul Gandhi, it was found that ABP news itself had already debunked the claim \u2013 \u2018\u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0935\u091c \u092e\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0932\u093f\u092e \u0925\u0947 \u092e\u0948\u0902 \u092e\u0941\u0938\u0932\u092e\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u0942: \u0930\u093e\u0939\u0941\u0932\u0917\u093e\u0902\u0927\u0940\u2019. In a tweet, the ABP news channel clarified that it did not telecast the quote and the \u2018Breaking News\u2019 template is doctored.\n\nAlso, no information regarding the telecast of the other quote (\u2018\u0915\u094b\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u092e\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0932\u093f\u092e\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u0914\u0930 \u0909\u0928\u0915\u0940 \u0939\u0940 \u0930\u0939\u0947\u0917\u0940\u2019) by the ABP news channel was found. On comparing the text in the \u2018Breaking News\u2019 template with the text in the actual \u2018Breaking News\u2019 template of ABP news channel, the differences in the font can be observed. Also, the word \u2018\u0915\u093e\u0902\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938\u2019 is mispelt as \u2018\u0915\u094b\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938\u2019.\n\nAlso, during the search process, it was found that there is a controversy whether Rahul Gandhi has made such a statement. When a similar claim was made by a newspaper previously, Congress leaders have denied the claim. FACTLY could not independently verify the authenticity of that quote, but from the above findings, it can be concluded that the \u2018Breaking News\u2019 template of ABP news channel with that statement of Rahul Gandhi is photoshopped.\n\nEarlier, when few social media posts claiming Rahul Gandhi family\u2019s affiliation to Muslims have gone viral, FACTLY has debunked them and the relevant fact checks can be read here, here and here.\n\nTo sum it up, the \u2018Breaking News\u2019 templates of ABP news channel in the image about Rahul Gandhi\u2019s and Congress Party\u2019s affiliation with Muslims is photoshopped.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
