Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.\n\n\n\nWhen searched about the tool, the website of \u2018Namaste\u2019 was found in the search results. On the \u2018Namaste\u2019 website, it can be seen that it is powered by \u2018inscripts\u2019. On the \u2018inscripts\u2019 website, it can be read that it is a private company, which is headquartered in Mumbai. It mentions that it provides high-end products to the customers and \u2018Namaste\u2019 is listed in their product list. There is no mention of it being launched by the government.\n\nAs the news went viral, the government portals (MyGovIndia and PIB) have debunked the claim and tweeted that it is fake news. Also, \u2018MyGovIndia\u2019 mentioned that the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has announced an innovation challenge for \u2018Made in India\u2019 video conferencing solution.\n\nAfter the clarification from the government, the \u2018Firstpost\u2019 has made a correction to their article. The initial version can be seen here. \n\n\n\nTo sum it up, \u2018Namaste\u2019 video conferencing tool was not launched by the government.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
