No, that's not true: President Putin never said that, and the Rothschilds' firm, under Giovanni Salvetti, is still in business at its Moscow financial center.\n\nThe claim appeared in an article (archived here) by Maker Kuman on the csglobe.com wwe ebsite on September 21, 2016, under the title\n\n\"Putin Has Banned Rothschild And His New World Order Banking Cartel Family From Entering Russian Territory.\"\n\nEven though the article is nearly four years old, it continues to be shared on social media, as recently as June 5, 2020. This is what one post looked like at the time of writing:\n\nPutin did not hesitate to inform advisers of his actions: 'grabbed them by the scruff of the neck and kicked them out Russia's back door.' During the meeting in question, Putin was clearly discontent about the secretive elite's agenda of taking over the country. Seems like his act of pounding his fist against the table and the promise to destroy the New World Order show clear evidence of Putin's integrity.\n\nThe article does not say when the order was given, where or to whom. But csglobe.com offers no written document or official order as proof that Putin was evicting the financiers. Moreover, there is proof that Jacob Rothschild was based in Britain, not Russia, throughout 2016 and was carrying out his own branch of the business in London, according to The Financial Times.\n\nThe site that promoted this story, csglobe.com, is rated a \"strong conspiracy website that promotes unproven claims,\" and is also rated \"Low\" for factual reporting by independent Media Bias Fact Check, an organization that ranks more than 3,000 news outlets worldwide for accuracy and fairness.\n\nAccording to Google Maps, Rothschild & Co. are located in Moscow's financial district and still open for business in 2020, here. It hasn't been kicked out of either Russia or the Commonwealth of Independent States, and the company's prospectus claims excellent results for its wealthy clients:\n\nTwo years after the csglobe.com post appeared, Rothschild remained a trusted name in Russian financing, according to this Reuters News Service report. It states that, in 2018, Rusal, the nation's largest producer of aluminum, hired the Rothschild group to broker a deal to save the mineral company from U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe common theme in conspiracy theories about a New World Order is that a secret power elite is planning to soon rule the world through one dominating government. But the csglobel article provides no proof of Rothschild alliances with specific others, no recorded or photographic proof of meetings, and no documents or evidence of criminal blueprints to further world domination.\n\nFor proof, csglobe.com uses only the phrases, \"according to sources\" and \"according to a Kremlin source.\"\n\nIn fact it appears csglobe got their information from YourNewsWire, a now defunct website that used to publish stories that were either completely made up or were based on real news reports but with fictional elements added to them. Lead Stories wrote about false stories published on that site many, many times.", "lang": "en"}
