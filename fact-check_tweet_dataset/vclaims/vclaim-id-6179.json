Was a player fired for it? Are some players asking the league to host a month of anti-police activism? Will Fox Sports stop airing NFL games?\n\n\n\nA: No. Three of those stories were made-up, and one is a gross misrepresentation.\n\n\n\nFacebook has been flush with stories about the National Football League since President Donald Trump called on team owners to fire any player who \u201cdisrespects our flag\u201d by making political demonstrations on the field during the national anthem.\n\nThe president\u2019s appeal drew criticism from the league\u2019s commissioner, Roger Goodell \u2014 who called for a \u201csense of unity\u201d \u2014 and various teams and players, who mostly either locked arms, took a knee or stayed off the field as the anthem played prior to games on Sept. 24 and 25.\n\nHowever, several of the stories that have been circulated widely, and flagged as potentially fake news on Facebook, are not true.\n\nClaim: The NFL fined Steelers players who weren\u2019t on the sidelines for the anthem.\n\n\n\nFlagged on: The Last Line of Defense, World News, The Trumppers and others.\n\nMore than a dozen websites posted a bogus story claiming the league fined the Pittsburgh Steelers $1 million for every player who wasn\u2019t present for the national anthem.\n\nPrior to the game against the Chicago Bears, Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin announced that his team would remain off the field for the anthem so that players wouldn\u2019t have to decide whether to stand or take a knee.\n\n\u201cIt was a bad decision,\u201d says the story that originated at thelastlineofdefense.org. \u201cNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who donated to Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign, announced shortly after the game began that every player who \u2018protested\u2019 the National Anthem and showed \u2018immense disrespect to our nation\u2019 would be fined a cool million dollars.\u201d\n\nHowever, no such fine has been imposed, Brian McCarthy, vice president for corporate communications at the NFL, confirmed to FactCheck.org. Goodell also didn\u2019t contribute to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, according to Federal Election Commission records.\n\nA disclaimer on the thelastlineofdefense.org says: \u201cAmerica\u2019s Last Line of Defense is a satirical publication that may sometimes appear to be telling the truth. We assure you that\u2019s not the case. We present fiction as fact and our sources don\u2019t actually exist.\u201d\n\n\n\n Claim: A group of NFL players are asking the league to make November a month to protest police officers.\n\nSome stories claim that players asked the NFL to support anti-police activism, which isn\u2019t true.\n\nAccording to a Sept. 22 post on uconservative.com: \u201cThey\u2019re demanding an anti-police activism month because \u2018police have shot over 300 men and women in this country\u2019?!\u201d\n\nA memo written by four current players to Goodell and Troy Vincent, the executive vice president of NFL football operations, did say that \u201cpolice have shot over 300 men and women in this country\u201d since 2016. However, it doesn\u2019t ask the league to engage in anti-police activism.\n\nInstead, the memo urges the league to use November \u201cto serve as a month of Unity for individual teams to engage and impact the community in their market.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, that would mean addressing issues of economic growth, education and police and community relations \u2014 which would emphasize work that some players have already begun by doing ride-alongs with police, partnering with officers to participate in players\u2019 community-related projects (like camps, events, and outreach), and town hall meetings to discuss issues facing the black community and come up with solutions.\n\nClaim: The Cleveland Browns fired a player for kneeling during the anthem.\n\nFlagged on: The Last Line of Defense, 365 US news and The USA Conservative.\n\nThis fake story claims that the Cleveland Browns fired one of its linebackers for taking a knee during the national anthem.\n\n\u201cJerry Haslam,\u201d the team\u2019s alleged owner, according to the story, is quoted saying: \u201cI felt powerless to fire them before\u2026 But now that I know my President is behind me, I will gladly fire every player who does this, starting with [Franklin] Lewis.\u201d\n\nBut the team\u2019s real owners are Jimmy and Dee Haslam, and no one named Franklin Lewis plays for the Browns.\n\nThe actual statement released by the Haslams on Sept. 24 said, in part: \u201cWe must not let misguided, uninformed and divisive comments from the President or anyone else deter us from our efforts to unify. Our stance in support of the liberties of peaceful, personal expression afforded to our players and all Americans will remain strong, and we will continue to encourage our players to respectfully use their earned platform to inspire positive change in our nation and throughout society.\u201d\n\nFlagged on: Consinfo, Breaking News House, America Info Corner and others.\n\nYet another self-described satirical story from thelastlineofdefense.org \u2014 which was republished by several websites without attribution \u2014 claims that Fox Sports will stop airing NFL games.\n\nThe story says that Fox Sports spokeswoman \u201cHolly McGee\u201d appeared on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Sept. 24 to announce that \u201cwe are standing\u201d with Trump and \u201crefusing to air the games until the 12 teams who have attacked the President apologize and players who disrespect our nation are punished.\u201d But that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nNo one from Fox\u2019s sports division appeared on the Sept. 24 edition of \u201cFox & Friends Weekend\u201d to make such an announcement. The Fox network aired several games that Sunday, and it is still scheduled to carry multiple games each week for the remainder of the season, including seven games on Oct. 1.\n\nConsinfo.us, one of the website\u2019s that republished the fraudulent story, even says on its \u201cabout us\u201d page: \u201cKeep in mind that everything we publish is in good faith, sometimes the articles are satires and fake and we cannot make any warranties about the completeness, reliability and accuracy of this information.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nWashington Post. \u201cTrump\u2019s full speech in support of Luther Strange in Alabama.\u201d YouTube video. 26 Sep 2017.\n\nStapleton, Arnie. \u201cMore than 200 NFL players sit or kneel during national anthem.\u201d Associated Press, via Chicago Tribune. 24 Sep 2017.\n\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette. \u201cTrump\u2019s remarks pull NFL owners into political debate; Steelers stay off field for anthem.\u201d 24 Sep. 2017.\n\n\u201c4 Black Players Just Made SICK Ultimatum To NFL Of What They Want To Force White Fans To Do For A Month.\u201d Freedomdaily.com.
