There were plenty of real news stories about that.\n\nHowever, there was no statement from Trump about it on the White House website. And our search of the Nexis news database turned up no stories that said Trump reacted to the decision by threatening to use Russia\u2019s own constitution against them, or that he urged Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in Russia \u201cto seek asylum in the United states until your rights are fully reinstated,\u201d as the fake story claims.\n\nInstead, we saw a genuine news story about the State Department denouncing the ban.\n\nU.S. News and World Report, April 21: The U.S. State Department has condemned the Russian ban on Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. \u201cThe United States is extremely concerned by the Russian government\u2019s actions targeting and repressing members of religious minorities, including Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, under the pretense of combating extremism,\u201d Acting State Department spokesman Mark C. Toner told U.S. News by email late Thursday night. Earlier Thursday, the Russian Supreme Court called the pacifist religious sect extremist and ordered the shuttering of more than 300 chapters in the country. \u201cWe call on the Russian authorities to ensure that Russia\u2019s anti-terrorism and anti-extremism legislation is not misused to target members of peaceful religious minorities, including the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses,\u201d Toner said. \u201cThe prosecution of peaceful religious minority groups for \u2018extremism\u2019 creates a climate of fear which itself undermines efforts to combat the threat of radicalization.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. News & World Report story didn\u2019t include any quotes from Trump. Neither did a Newsweek story that quoted the chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, Thomas J. Reese, saying: \u201cRussia has been cracking down on religious groups that are not supportive of the government and it\u2019s just amazing to pick on a small group which is pacifist which doesn\u2019t want to be involved in politics and to classify them as the same is [sic] ISIS just shows how absurd these extremism laws are in Russia.\u201d\n\nFacebook users have reported the fake story \u2014 which was published on websites including houstonchronicle-tv.com, states-tv.com, usanews-tv.com and fox-news24.com \u2014 using the social network\u2019s tool for flagging suspected hoaxes.\n\nReaders should know that houstonchronicle-tv.com isn\u2019t the website of the Houston Chronicle newspaper, nor is fox-news24.com a website of Fox News. Fox-news24.com is actually affiliated with the website USA Television, which publishes fake news stories, but also republishes some real stories from authentic news sources.\n\nWe wrote about one of the bogus stories on USA Television that said Trump signed executive orders allowing nationals from various countries to travel to the U.S. without visas.\n\nAnother USA Television website posted a fake story under the headline \u201cTrump consoles Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses on Russia ban as he worships with them.\u201d That story was published on ab.cnewsgo.com, which shouldn\u2019t be confused for the URL of the real ABC News website, abcnews.go.com. Snopes.com found that that made-up story had been shared on Facebook with a photo of Trump and others attending an interfaith prayer service in January and not a recent service with Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, as the story claims.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to help identify and label viral fake news stories flagged by readers on the social media network.\n\nHoustonchronicle-tv.com. \u201cTrump Warns Russia Over Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Ban and Urges Members to Seek Asylum in the US.\u201d 20 Apr 2017.\n\nFox-news24.com. \u201cTrump Warns Russia Over Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Ban and Urges Members to Seek Asylum in the US.\u201d 20 Apr 2017.\n\nAb.cnewsgo.com. \u201cTrump consoles Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses on Russia ban as he worships with them.\u201d Accessed 2 May 2017.\n\nHiggens, Andrew. \u201cRussia Bans Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, Calling It an Extremist Group.\u201d New York Times. 20 Apr 2017.\n\nHiggens, Andrew. \u201cRussia Moves to Ban Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses as \u2018Extremist.\u2019 \u201d New York Times. 4 Apr 2017.\n\nEvon, Dan. \u201cDid Trump Warn Russia Over Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses Ban and Urge Members to Seek Asylum in the U.S.?\u201d Snopes.com. 2 May 2017.", "lang": "en"}
