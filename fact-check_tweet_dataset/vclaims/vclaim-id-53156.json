This article does not include similar incidents that occurred after publication. The original article continues below:\n\nIn June 2020, as protests against racial injustice and police violence continued across the U.S. in the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s death while in police custody, a Black man named Robert Fuller was found dead hanging from a tree in California. While local authorities initially ruled Fuller\u2019s death a suicide, the family of the 24-year-old urged authorities to open an investigation into the case.\n\nThough Fuller\u2019s death made national news, social media users claimed that several similar incidents (of investigators declaring such deaths as \u201csuicides\u201d) had also occurred in the days since\u2019s Floyd\u2019s death on May 25:\n\nThese posts appear to be referring to the deaths of Robert Fuller, Malcolm Harsch, and Dominique Alexander, three Black men who were found hanging dead from trees in the spring in 2020. Fuller and Alexander\u2019s deaths were both initially ruled as suicides. Authorities have reserved stating the manner of death for Harsch, but they have said that they do not suspect foul play.\n\nThe fourth death mentioned in this post is likely referring to an unidentified man who was found hanging in the Shady Acres neighborhood of Houston, Texas. While social media posts initially identified this person as a Black man, authorities later identified him as Latino. Furthermore, the man\u2019s family reportedly told authorities that he had been suicidal.\n\nWe have been unable to find any reports about a fifth death that matches this rumor\u2019s description. It\u2019s likely that social media users mistook an older incident for a recent one, such as the death of Titi Gulley in 2019, or mistook a recent gun death for a hanging, such as the death of Rayshard Brooks.\n\nBelow are details about each case.\n\nRobert Fuller, 24, Found Hanging From a Tree Near City Hall in Palmdale, California, on June 10\n\n\n\nFuller\u2019s death was initially ruled a suicide, but Fuller\u2019s family, the local community, and the city of Palmdale are demanding more investigation. The Guardian reported:\n\nMalcolm Harsch, 38, Found Hanging From a Tree in Victorville, California, on May 31\n\nAs of this writing, an official manner of death for Harsch has not been announced, and the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department said his death is still an open and active investigation. From the outset, however, authorities said they did not suspect foul play. The local news outlet Victor Valley News reported:\n\nInitially, Harsch\u2019s relatives said in a statement they were concerned that the death would be ruled a suicide and that they were alarmed by the manner in which Harsh was found:\n\n\u201cOur brother Malcolm Harsch died on May 31st. His cause of death has not been released to the family yet but we are concerned that his death will be labeled as a suicide, as this is what was communicated to us upon confirmation of his death on the morning of June 1st. \u201cAmidst the current racial tension and following the protesting the night prior to his body being discovered we were truly troubled to learn of his passing particularly of how his body was discovered. He is an African-American man whose body was found hanging from a tree!\u201d\n\nBut surveillance video released to the family and shown to journalists by officials in mid-June appeared to confirm reports that Harsch hanged himself. Through a spokesperson, the family released a statement saying, \u201cOn behalf of the family of Malcolm Harsch unfortunately it seems he did take his own life.\u201d\n\nOn June 15, the FBI and the Department of Justice announced they were monitoring the investigations into the deaths of both Harsch and Malcolm Fuller.\n\nDominique Alexander, 27, Found Hanging From a Tree in NYC on June 9\n\nThe death of 27-year-old Dominique Alexander, who was was found dead hanging from a tree in Fort Tryon Park in Manhattan on June 9, was ruled a suicide by the city\u2019s medical examiner. The New York Daily News reported:\n\nUnidentified Man Found Hanging From a Tree in the Shady Acres Neighborhood of Houston, Texas, on June 15\n\nWhile social media postings about this death initially identified this person as a Black male, the Houston Police Department reported that he was Latino. Foul play is not suspected, and the man\u2019s family reportedly told authorities that the victim was suicidal. The Houston Chronicle reported:\n\nWe have been unable to uncover news reports about a purported fifth incident. Some social media users suggested that the fifth hanging occurred in Portland, Oregon, or Atlanta, Georgia, but it appears that someone mistook an older incident as recent, or included the death of a Black man who was fatally shot, but not hanged, in the spring of 2020.\n\nSpecifically, the fifth death is likely referring to Titi (or Tete) Gulley, a black transgender woman, who was found hanging from a tree in Rocky Butte Park in Portland, Oregon, in May 2019 (her death was ruled a suicide, but her family believes that she was murdered), or Rayshard Brooks, who was fatally shot by police officers during an altercation at a Wendy\u2019s drive-thru in Atlanta on June 12, 2020.\n\nIt should also be noted that shortly after this article was published, the Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office announced that a Black teenager was found dead hanging from a tree near a school in Texas. An official manner of death has not been announced but preliminary reports pointed to suicide.", "lang": "en"}
