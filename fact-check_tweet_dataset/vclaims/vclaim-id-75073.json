(Novus Ordo Seclorum is inscribed in the $1 bill. The U.S. State Department translates the Latin text to \"A new order of the ages.\")\n\n\"It\u2019s pretty clear what the agenda is of this traitor we knew was an American-hating globalist all along,\" the post claimed, adding that along with two islands due east of Virginia in international waters, there also are \"massive complexes with billions in equipment and spying technology outside of Washington DC, New York and Los Angeles.\"\n\nThe post also claims Obama is holding \"secret meetings\" with bipartisan officials and diplomats from around the world \"in a mansion that is a part of the old Washington tunnel system.\"\n\nThat part of the story reminded us of another hoax claiming Obama was trying to take down President Donald Trump by establishing a shadow government outside the White House. That Pants on Fire claim also said Obama held secret meetings with world leaders.\n\nWe reached out to Newsfeed USA\u2019s Facebook account for evidence backing its claim. A reply said \"Google.\" But there\u2019s no credible information backing Newsfeed USA\u2019s story. If there was any merit to the claim, it would have been in national and international headlines of legitimate news sources.\n\nNewsfeed USA\u2019s post is inaccurate and makes a ridiculous claim. We rate it Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
