While Administration officials have said that they will site visits to these facilities with two weeks\u2019 notice, they do not say that they will requests with such notice. Senator Merkley\u2019s office is unaware of any such permissions granted to lawmakers (or anyone else) during the Trump Administration or, more specifically, since the enactment of its new \u201cZero Tolerance\u201d policy for those crossing the border, including asylum seekers.", "lang": "en"}
