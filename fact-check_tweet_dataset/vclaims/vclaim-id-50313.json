Joe Biden was a vocal opponent of busing as a means for desegregating public schools. And that record haunts him in his bid to secure the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nIn early March 2020, readers asked Snopes to verify a quote in 1977 in which Biden, then a U.S. senator representing Delaware, allegedly expressed fear that desegregation, if not done in an \u201corderly\u201d way, could result in his children growing up in \u201ca racial jungle with tensions having built so high that it is going to explode at some point.\u201d\n\nThe quote was initially uncovered by Daria Roithmayr, a law professor at the University of Southern California (USC), in July 2019. But as Biden emerged from Super Tuesday on March 3, 2020, as a potential front-runner for the nomination, news stories containing the quote circulated anew.\n\nAmong stories readers widely shared was a July 15, 2019, Business Insider story that reported, \u201cFormer Vice President Joe Biden is facing increased scrutiny over his record on busing and racial issues, and this week old comments resurfaced in which he said, in 1977, that busing for the purpose of desegregation would cause his children to \u2018grow up in a racial jungle.\n\nThe quote is accurate as reported and reads in full:\n\nUnless we do something about this, my children are going to grow up in a jungle, the jungle being a racial jungle with tensions having built so high that it is going to explode at some point. We have got to make some move on this.\n\nWe contacted the Biden campaign for comment but received no response in time for publication.\n\nBiden made the remark in 1977 during a hearing about busing school children in order to desegregate public schools. As The New York Times reported in a detailed delineation of Biden\u2019s history with busing, Biden at the time had emerged as the Democratic party\u2019s crusader against busing, taking the same side as segregationists. Biden \u201cjoined up with Jesse Helms, the segregationist senator from North Carolina, to offer his own anti-busing amendment to that year\u2019s education spending bill.\u201d Biden\u2019s \u201cadvocacy made it safe for other Democrats to oppose busing,\u201d The Times reported.\n\nThe Times further reported that Biden sided with Helms in 1975 when the latter proposed to strip the federal government\u2019s power to withhold funding from school districts that refused to comply with racial-equality measures:\n\nUnder the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, the federal Department of Health, Education and Welfare had a powerful tool to fight school segregation: It could withhold funding from districts that refused to integrate \u2014 and integration effectively meant busing. Mr. Helms wanted to strip the agency of that power. As Mr. Biden rose on the Senate floor in September 1975 to embrace that approach, Mr. Helms wryly welcomed him \u201cto the ranks of the enlightened.\u201d Mr. Biden objected to the education department mandating desegregation absent a court order, and warned of white flight to the suburbs and even racial unrest. \u2026 Mr. Helms\u2019s amendment, which would have also barred the education department from collecting data about the race of students or teachers, failed. But a slightly narrower measure written by Mr. Biden, which prevented schools from using federal dollars to assign teachers or students by race, passed, 50-43.\n\nRoithmayr told us via email that busing, along with affirmative action, were viewed by those trying to achieve desegregation of schools after Brown v. Board of Education as effective tools. That was \u201cbecause they were linked to the possibility of \u2018big structural change,\u2019 change that didn\u2019t require bigger overhaul, like desegregating cities and restructuring financing for public school education. I suppose expediency is one way to describe it, but effective and pragmatic might be another way.\u201d\n\nBecause Biden made the remark about a \u201cracial jungle,\u201d we rate this claim as a \u201cCorrect Attribution.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
