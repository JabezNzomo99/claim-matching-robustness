This is equal to $351.75 per person each week or a combined $1407 a fortnight. That total includes the maximum available pension supplement of $51.90 each ($103.80 combined) and an energy supplement of $10.60 each ($21.20 combined).\n\nThis means an Australian pensioner couple can receive a maximum payment of $33,768 a year - double the amount claimed in the post.\n\nPeople granted refugee status in Australia are mostly of working age, according to a 2014 research paper from the Australian Parliamentary Library. This means if they qualify for a government benefit it would be the Newstart Allowance.\n\nA refugee couple can currently receive a maximum fortnightly Newstart payment of $504.70 each ($252.35 a week), or a combined $1009.40 a fortnight ($504.70 a week).\n\nThey could receive an additional $7.90 each or $15.80 combined for an energy supplement per fortnight ($3.95 each or $7.90 combined weekly) and may get rent assistance.\n\nTo get the maximum rent assistance of $130 a fortnight, their combined fortnightly rent has to be at least $372.73.\n\nA refugee may receive a one-off crisis payment if they experience a difficult or extreme situation. The crisis payment is equal to one week of their existing income support payment, excluding allowances or supplements. A refugee couple would receive a one-off $504.70 if eligible for a crisis payment.\n\nTherefore, a refugee couple could receive government assistance of up to $28,229.50 a year including the one-off crisis payment or $27,724.80 excluding the crisis payment.\n\nThis is half the amount claimed in the post and less than the government assistance provided to a couple on the age pension.\n\nThe claim that pensioners get less than refugees has been debunked in the past by the ABC Mediawatch program in 2008, the Refugee Council in 2012, the Parliamentary Library in 2012 and 2014 and the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre.", "lang": "en"}
