Using a variety of sources and information, the JIT established that the Buk belonged to the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade of the Russian army, based in the Russian city of Kursk. During the presentation, the JIT officials referred to markings on the Buk launch vehicle which they compared to \u201cfingerprints,\u201d saying these fingerprints could be used to identify which unit the Buk belonged to.\n\n\u201cSeveral images of the BUK-TELAR with which MH17 was downed are available,\u201d a press release on the JIT\u2019s official site stated. \u201cAnalysis of those produces a number of characteristics. The combination of those is so special that that can be considered as a fingerprint. This fingerprint has been compared with numerous images of BUK-TELARS, both Ukrainian and Russian ones. The only BUK-TELAR on which this combination of characteristics also was found, is a BUK-TELAR that was recorded several times when it joined a convoy of the 53rd brigade on 23 \u2013 25 June 2014.\u201d\n\nLater on May 24, the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti published a response from Yuri Shvytkin, deputy head of the State Duma\u2019s Defense Committee. Shvytkin called the investigations findings \u201cstupidity\u201d and \u201can obvious fake.\u201d But based on Shvytkin\u2019s quotes, it appears he misunderstood what the JIT said about how they identified the Buk.\n\nWe were prepared to call Shvytkin\u2019s claim \u201cfalse.\u201dBut about two hours after publishing the piece, RIA Novosti added a disclaimer to the story which said that the \u201ccommentary was nullified due to an incorrect translation from initial news reports,\u201d along with an apology to the readers.\n\nWhat happened? It\u2019s not really clear. It seems Shvytkin took the term \u201cfingerprints\u201d literally, and questioned how the JIT could possibly identify the Buk\u2019s unit based on fingerprints when they have no biometric data for Russian servicemen. He also questioned how fingerprints can belong to a military brigade and not an individual soldier, further demonstrating that he did not understand the JIT\u2019s statement. \n\n\n\nYet RIA Novosti\u2019s disclaimer, itself, is not clear.The Russian news organization did not call it a \u201ccorrection,\u201d although the effect of saying the commentary is \u201cnull\u201d amounts to admitting the story was incorrect.Moreover, there was no indication as to whether RIA Novosti or Deputy Yuri Shvytkin or somebody else was responsible for the mistranslation.\n\nSo, we still find the whole episode to be \u201cmisleading,\u201d much like a succession of claims by the Russian government and Russian state media \u2013 such as the claim that a Ukrainian fighter shot it down or that is was a Ukrainian government Buk missile, among many other claims that have since been thoroughly debunked.", "lang": "en"}
