{"title": "VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Story about anti-Duterte blog MISLEADS by using unrelated photo and outdated tweet", "subtitle": "This story uses misleading photos.", "author": "www.verafiles.org", "date": "Apr 30, 2018, 5:07 PM", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-4220", "url": "https://www.verafiles.org/articles/vera-files-fact-check-story-about-anti-duterte-blog-misleads", "vclaim": "Website goodnewsnetworkph.com published May 7 a story that is almost an exact copy-paste of a May 4 Pinoy Ako Blog (PAB) post, except it used a misleading screengrab of a year-old anti-Duterte tweet and an unrelated photo of PAB author Jover Laurio.\n\nThe post bore the headline: \"JOVER LAURIO PINAGTAWANAN ANG DDS. Mga Pinoy na positibong nag-react sa Cover Page ni Duterte sa TIME Magazine, pinagtawanan ni Pinoy Ako Blog (Jover Laurio laughed at DDS. Filipinos who reacted positively to Duterte's cover page at Time Magazine, laughed at by Pinoy Ako Blog).\"\n\nYet, following the headline is a screengrab of a PAB tweet about Duterte's first overseas trip with partner Honeylet Avancena and daughter Veronica, originally posted May 10, 2017.\n\nMore, the post includes a photo of Laurio with Sen. Risa Hontiveros, which like the screengrab of the 2017 tweet, is unrelated to the goodnewsnetworkph.com story.\n\nThe goodnewsnetworkph.com story then extensively quoted PAB\u2019s May 4 post criticizing Duterte supporters for praising the president for landing on the May cover of Time magazine, labelled a \"strongman\" along with three other world leaders.\n\nDuterte has subsequently denied he is a strongman, saying he \"has never sent anybody to jail for criticizing\" him.\n\nIts story could have reached more than 5.6 million people, the biggest traffic generator on social media being MOCHA USON BLOG, the pro-Duterte blog managed by Presidential Communications Assistant Secretary Margaux \"Mocha\" Uson.\n\n(Editor's Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.
