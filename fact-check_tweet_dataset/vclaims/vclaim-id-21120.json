In the aftermath of the Great Recession, the Fed dramatically lowered rates to near zero \u2014 and kept them there for years. As he began running for president, Trump darkly warned that rates were being kept artificially low to ensure Hillary Clinton\u2019s election and that everything would tumble once rates began to creep up again.\n\nAt the time of that tweet, Apple\u2019s stock was about $78 a share \u2014 and as of August 2017, it\u2019s about doubled in value since that date. (Despite his claim that he dumped Apple stock, Trump\u2019s financial disclosure also indicated that he actually held onto about $1 million in Apple stock until he sold it after he was elected president.)\n\nDuring the recession, the Dow Jones industrial average fell to a market low of 6,443 on March 6, 2009, early in President Barack Obama\u2019s first term. It stood at 19,827 when Trump took the oath of office Jan. 20, after a post-election rally that started at about 18,000. So there was already a substantial gain when Trump became president \u2014 what he used to deride as a bubble.\n\n\u201cWe have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what\u2019s happening. We have a stock market that is so bloated.\u201d\n\n \u2014 Presidential announcement speech, June 16, 2015\n\n\u201cYou have a situation where you have an inflated stock market. It started to deflate, but then it went back up again. Usually that\u2019s a bad sign. That\u2019s a sign of things to come. And yeah, I think we\u2019re sitting on a very, very big bubble.\u201d\n\n \u2014 Interview with Bob Woodward and Robert Costa of The Washington Post, April 2, 2016\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re keeping the rates artificially low so that Obama can go out and play golf in January and say that he did a good job. It\u2019s a very false economy \u2026 an artificial stock market.\u201d\n\n \u2014 Remarks to reporters on his plane, Sept. 5, 2016\n\n\u201cWe are in a big, fat, ugly bubble. \u2026 The only thing that looks good is the stock market. But if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that\u2019s going to come crashing down.\u201d\n\n \u2014 Second presidential debate, Sept. 26, 2016\n\n\u201cYou take a look at what\u2019s going on with the stock market. Trillions of dollars of value have been created since I won the election \u2014 I mean trillions.\u201d\n\n \u2014 Interview with Fox News, Feb. 28\n\n\u201cSo when I say the stock market is at an all-time high, we\u2019ve picked up in market value almost $4 trillion since Nov. 8th, which was the election. $4 trillion \u2014 it\u2019s a lot of money. Personally, I picked up nothing, but that\u2019s all right.\u201d\n\n \u2014 Remarks, July 6\n\nThe president has never explained his shift in position on the stock market, especially now that the Fed has raised interest rates three times since he was elected. He earns yet another upside-down Pinocchio for his flip-flop.", "lang": "en"}
