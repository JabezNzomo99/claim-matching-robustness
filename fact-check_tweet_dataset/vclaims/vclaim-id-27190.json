But, hey, this is Washington. While there are many lobbying or research firms with a certain ideological orientation, some operate like law firms, doing specific work on behalf of a client who hires it.\n\nFusion in June hired Christopher Steele, a former MI6 agent known for his contacts in Russia, and Steele produced a series of salacious memos, claiming the Kremlin had the goods to blackmail Trump, which made its way to reporters, members of Congress and the FBI. The FBI considered Steele\u2019s work credible enough that it reached an agreement to pay him to continue his work, though the planned arrangement fell apart after the dossier became public.\n\nHermitage Capital Management, the alleged victim of the fraud, is headed by William Browder, once a top investor in Russia who had a falling out with the Russian government. Browder had hired Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian tax accountant, to investigate an alleged theft from his Russian companies, but Magnitsky was arrested and died in prison in 2009 under suspicious circumstances. Browder\u2019s advocacy of Magnitsky\u2019s case led Congress to pass the 2012 Magnitsky Act, which bars Russian officials believed to be involved in the lawyer\u2019s death from entering the United States or using its banking system. In response, Russia blocked U.S. parents from adopting Russian children.\n\nVeselnitskaya was also working for Baker Hotstetler on the Prevezon case, according to a declaration she filed in federal court in 2016. In addition, she sought to help Prevezon fan opposition against the Magnitsky sanctions. Shortly after her meeting at Trump Tower, she attended a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Russian sanctions and a screening at the Newseum of a film attacking the Magnitsky Act. Another person at the Trump Tower meeting was Rinat Akhmetshin, who was once registered as the lead lobbyist for a group called the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative, which claimed it wanted \u201cto help restart American adoption of Russian children.\u201d It was housed in the same office building as Baker Hostetler. Denis Katsyv, the owner of Prevezon, was listed as one of the Russians who controlled the organization, which no longer seems to exist.\n\nSo what was Fusion\u2019s work on the Prevezon case? Prevezon sought to turn the tables on Browder, the government\u2019s main witness, by arguing Magnitsky aided him in fraud, rather than exposing crimes. So Fusion was tasked to find information to undermine the story that Browder had told lawmakers and U.S. government officials about the Magnitsky case, according to statements the firm has made. \u201cSimpson and his firm found records on Browder\u2019s property and finances and tracked down potential witnesses,\u201d Fusion told Politico in December 2016. \u201cFusion GPS also discussed the case record with several reporters, according to the statement.\u201d\n\nInformation uncovered by Fusion as part of the litigation also became part of the anti-Magnitsky campaign. In 2016, Browder filed a complaint with the Justice Department accusing Fusion of failing to register as a lobbyist for a foreign interest under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Fusion said in a July statement that \u201cit complied with the law\u201d and \u201cworked for and under the supervision of an American law firm to provide support for civil litigation in New York\u201d and thus was not required to register under FARA. In other words, the work product was for the litigation, not any lobbying. As far as we can determine, there is little evidence Fusion itself was involved in the anti-Magnitsky advocacy, even if the fruits of its research may have aided foes of the Magnitsky law.\n\nFARA is weakly enforced, but two former Trump aides, Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn, are under investigation for allegedly failing to comply with FARA. So one can see the White House\u2019s interest in raising allegations of FARA fraud. Whether Fusion should have registered for FARA is now the subject of a Senate Judiciary Committee investigation. While there is an exemption in FARA for certain legal work, that exemption does not apply to public relations work.\n\nIn the end, a federal appeals court in late 2016 ordered Baker Hotstetler to end its representation because of a conflict of interest (a lawyer at the firm had previously represented Hermitage). That apparently also ended Fusion\u2019s involvement. Prevezon settled the case in May for $6 million, with no admission of wrongdoing, in what both sides claimed was a victory. (The United States had sought to seize assets worth as much as $24 million.) The competing claims were never litigated, though NBC News in July explored in detail the doubts about the Magnitsky case raised by Prevezon\u2019s defense team.\n\nAs we noted, Fusion\u2019s original client for the Trump opposition research was said to have been a Republican. Fusion\u2019s client list is not public, but critical news reports have cited Fusion\u2019s work on behalf of Planned Parenthood in 2015 and against a Mitt Romney donor in 2012. We could find no record of political contributions by Simpson, though one of his partners, Peter R. Fristch, made two $500 contributions to Hillary Clinton campaign committees in 2016, according to Federal Election Commission records. But that does not necessarily mean the firm works only on behalf of Democrats or is \u201cDemocrat-linked.\u201d Obviously, it would be helpful to learn who bankrolled the opposition research on Trump\u2019s business dealings.", "lang": "en"}
