The photos are taken from mainstream media reports of rallies in 2016 in Jakarta by Muslim groups against the city\u2019s then governor.\n\nOne of the posts featuring the photos is this January 13, 2019 entry which has been shared more than 4,000 times. It is captioned: \u201cIn Solo. Very cool. Prabowo-Sandi 02 has taken the city.\u201d.\n\nSandi refers to Subianto\u2019s running mate, Sandiaga Uno, and \u201c02\u201d is the pair\u2019s ballot number in the upcoming Indonesia\u2019s elections, to be held in April, 2019.\n\nSolo is a city on Indonesia\u2019s Java Island where Widodo originates from. Widodo was a two-term mayor in Solo before becoming president.\n\nFerdinand Hutahaean, a politician from a pro-Subianto political party, also shared the images to Twitter in a misleading context on January 12. His tweet claimed they showed a rally \u201cthis morning\u201d that wanted Widodo to be ousted from office.\n\nBelow is a snapshot of his tweet.\n\nThe tweet says: \"Having seen the photos of the event this morning, at which sympathizers of the 212 movement gathered, I have to say that @jokowi is done. 1,000 people may be unable to make you step down, but millions of us will force you to do so. Now is the time for @prabowo to lead and repair the damages that have occurred.\"\n\nThe \"212 movement\" refers to participants of a December 2, 2016 rally, which called for the jailing of the Indonesian capital\u2019s then governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, or Ahok, for blasphemy.\n\nBoth the claims in the Facebook post and Hutahaean\u2019s tweet are untrue.\n\nGoogle reverse image results show that the pictures are from a massive rally on November 4, 2016, in Jakarta by Muslim groups that also called for Ahok to be jailed for blasphemy.\n\nThe first photo appeared in this article and this one about the rally.\n\nA white banner saying: \u201cA fatwa by Indonesian Ulema Council on Ahok\u201d -- referring to the agency\u2019s document on the case -- can be seen in the image.\n\nThe second picture can be seen in this Rappler.com article about the December 2, 2016 Muslim rally with similar motive to the one held in Jakarta the month before.\n\nIt was a photo taken by Indonesian state-run news agency Antara of the earlier rally, and was captioned \u201cThousands of people grouped under the National Movement To Safeguard The Indonesian Ulema Council\u2019s Fatwa (GNPF MUI) stage a rally on November 4 in Jakarta.\u201d\n\nAccording to local media reports, there was a Muslim mass prayer in Solo on January 13, 2019. This CNN Indonesia report quoted a local police chief saying that \"there were speeches that called on the crowd to vote for the Prabowo Subianto-Sandiaga Uno pair\" at the event.\n\nBut only around 1,000 people attended the prayer meeting, according to this article on Tempo.co, which also posted photographs of the January 13 event.", "lang": "en"}
