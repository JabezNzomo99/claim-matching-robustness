Flight logs only show Gates on one flight from New Jersey to Florida.\n\nEpstein, a financier and convicted sex offender, was found dead in his jail cell at Manhattan\u2019s Metropolitan Correctional Center in August 2019 from what officials deemed a suicide while awaiting trial for federal sex-trafficking charges. While he was still alive, Epstein had connections to rich and powerful people such as Gates, former President Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew, according to Axios.\n\nThe viral post claims Gates traveled to Epstein\u2019s private Caribbean island, Little St. James, 17 times via Epstein\u2019s private jet. The island, where some of Epstein\u2019s accusers have said they were sexually assaulted, had been nicknamed \u201cPedophile Island\u201d by some of the locals, The New York Times reported.\n\n\u201cBefore you listen to him about coronavirus always remember he flew to Epstein island at least 17 times,\u201d the post claims.

The Daily Caller reviewed Epstein\u2019s publicly available flight logs, uploaded online by the websites Gawker and FactCheck.org, and found only one mention of Gates in them. That March 2013 flight went from Teterboro airport in New Jersey to Palm Beach International airport in Florida, not to the U.S. Virgin Islands where his island is located.\n\nIn 2019, a spokesperson for Gates told The New York Times that Gates hadn\u2019t been aware that the plane belonged to Epstein.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Gates met with Epstein on multiple occasions starting in 2011, just a few years after he had pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor. Epstein also met with employees from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, according to The New York Times.\n\n\u201cBill Gates regrets ever meeting with Epstein and recognizes it was an error in judgment to do so,\u201d said Bridgitt Arnold, a spokeswoman for Gates, to The New York Times. \u201cGates recognizes that entertaining Epstein\u2019s ideas related to philanthropy gave Epstein an undeserved platform that was at odds with Gates\u2019s personal values and the values of his foundation.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
