This claim is false; the video creator told AFP that he is not a doctor but a college student who made the video for a project on how videos go viral on the internet.\n\nThe video was published here on the video-blogging website World Star Hip Hop on January 29, 2020, and has been viewed more than 291,000 times since.\n\nThe video shows a man dressed in a white lab coat testing droplets of \u201cnormal blood\u201d and \u201cpatient zero\u201d blood. The former stained a napkin red, while the latter left a deep purple stain, of a different viscosity.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe video is titled: \u201cScary: Doctor Shows The Difference Between Healthy And Contagious Coronavirus Blood!\u201d\n\nA new strain of coronavirus, believed to have emerged from a wildlife market in the city of Wuhan has killed 425 in China and infected more than 20,000 others as of February 4, 2020, according to this AFP report.\n\nThe World Health Organization has declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global emergency. The virus has spread more than 20 other countries, with two fatalities reported in the Philippines and Hong Kong.\n\nInformation on the novel coronavirus and its current outbreak can be found here on the World Health Organization's website.\n\nThe same video has also been shared here, here, here and here on Facebook; here on Twitter; here on YouTube; and here on the video-sharing platform Flyheight, alongside a similar claim.\n\nThis claim is false; the man in the video told AFP that he is not a doctor but a student who made the video for a college project on how videos can go viral on the internet.\n\nMitch Wright, who posted the original video on his TikTok account @wright.mitchr, told AFP the video is \u201dfake\u201d.\n\n\u201cYes it's fake, I have a college course in digital literacy and social media. Our project was [to] pick a platform and post/describe how people get viral,\u201d Wright said via Twitter direct message on January 31, 2020.\n\n\u201cI had a bloody nose and jumped on making a video. The first one was taken down due to my blood on my face. TikTok took the first [video] down, I voluntarily took down the next two because it spread faster than I thought and my project had proven successful. I also was asked by multiple dms to do so.\n\n\u201cI never intended to blow up like that. I did [tag] satire and made sure I was fake enough but I guess it wasn't. Once my video was down that Twitter user had saved a copy and re-uploaded. That one is currently at 8 [million views]. I don't know if you noticed but in that video I didn't say the word coronavirus at all.\u201d\n\nWright also responded to his video which appeared on Twitter, where he also declared that the video was \u201c100% fake.\u201d\n\nThe video was also identified as being false in these media reports by news agency the Associated Press and Vice.", "lang": "en"}
