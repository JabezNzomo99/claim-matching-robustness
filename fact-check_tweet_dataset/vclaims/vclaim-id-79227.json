And I haven\u2019t endorsed any candidate mainly because for a lot of those years, nobody really wanted my endorsement,\" Beck said with a laugh. \"And quite honestly, I have never endorsed anybody because I haven\u2019t trusted any of the weasels, no matter how good they are.\"\n\nBeck made that comment a little over seven minutes into his half-hour presentation, which concluded with Beck saying the press was right: \"I am here to announce that I am officially endorsing Ted Cruz.\"\n\nWe were curious about Beck\u2019s declaration that he hadn't previously endorsed a candidate.\n\nWe failed to reach Beck for elaboration. Meantime, our search of the Nexis news database indicated no previous Beck endorsement of a presidential aspirant. And while we found we found two reports of Beck endorsing a candidate, further review showed one reported endorsement didn\u2019t happen and the other was a Beck joke.\n\nA Feb. 2, 2010, item, in the Inside the Beltway column in The Washington Times, said Illinois businessman Adam Andrzejewski, among Republicans running for governor, had been drawing fresh \"tea-party\" support. The item continued: \"Fox News host Glenn Beck has also endorsed Mr. Andrzejewski,\" as had commentator Rush Limbaugh.\n\nWe reached Andrzejewski, who replied by email: \"In real-time, many people in Glenn Beck\u2019s radio listening audience took his broadcast as an endorsement of my 2010 campaign for governor of Illinois. However, Beck clarified the following day that he did not endorse, but instead had just replayed the endorsement of my candidacy by Polish President and Nobel Laureate Lech Walesa.\"\n\nAndrzejewski pointed us to a Feb. 2, 2010, post by the American Spectator stating Beck had said on the air that day that he was \"getting a lot of mail that I endorsed\" Andrzejewski when, Beck said, he\u2019d only intended to share audio of Walesa speaking in favor of the candidate. \"I don\u2019t endorse candidates and I don\u2019t know this guy, but I wish him all the best,\" Beck said.\n\nOn May 16, 2011, Californian Dan Adler\u2019s House campaign issued a press release headlined, \"Glenn Beck`s Surprising First Ever Endorsement Goes to Democrat Dan Adler in California`s Special Congressional Election.\"\n\nThe release opened: \"For the first time in his life, conservative TV and radio personality Glenn Beck has given an endorsement to a candidate running for Congress in a special election tomorrow. In contrast to conventional wisdom, the endorsement did not go to someone of Beck's political extreme but to Dan Adler, a lifelong Democrat who is socially progressive. Adler, who has been urging voters of the South Bay community area to elect a citizen legislator instead of a career politician, recently caught Beck's eye for populist-themed Send a Mensch to Congress TV spots.\"\n\nThe release continued: \"In a posting on Beck\u2019s website today, the conservative talk show host said, \u2018people should vote based on principles and values and not race or creed,\u2019 he then moved to \u2018heartily endorse\u2019 Adler.\" The release said that on Beck\u2019s May 13, 2011, radio show, \"Beck and his cohorts ridiculed the Asian American and other minority voters who make up nearly 50% of California\u2019s 36th District. Then a confused Beck endorsed Adler\u2019s candidacy, stating that Californians deserve to see Adler in Congress and that \u2018you\u2019re going to love him.\u2019\"\n\nWe clicked next to a May 16, 2011, post on Beck\u2019s website suggesting Beck made his endorsement tongue-in-cheek (and there\u2019s a full Beck-sponsored summary of the not-for-real endorsement here).\n\nAccording to the post, Beck had included an Adler ad on his program the week before as the worst political ad ever. The post on Beck\u2019s site continued:\n\n\"The ads, promoting Californian Dan Adler, featured a Korean woman who said that she should vote for Adler simply because she\u2019s Korean and he\u2019s Jewish and that minorities should \u2018stick together.\u2019 The ad also featured several offensive stereotypes of Koreans and Asians. Glenn took issue with the ad, saying that people should vote based on principles and values, not race or creed.\"\n\nThat doesn\u2019t read like Beck was poised to endorse. The post on Beck\u2019s site went on:\n\n\"Somehow, Adler took Glenn\u2019s criticism as an endorsement and released a statement declaring himself the candidate endorsed by Glenn Beck. This morning, Dan may regret his statement. \u2018It doesn\u2019t make any sense for a progressive to want my endorsement. So, today I heartily endorse \u2014 what\u2019s his name? \u2014 Dan Adler. I want the voters in California to know that we are practically brothers of the brain,\u2019 Glenn said. \u2018We are so like minded, he has the same positions on almost everything, although he\u2019s not coming out and saying those things.\u2019 \u2018We both believe that the rich are paying far too much. Pay their fair share? They pay more than their fair share. They deserve a tax break,\u2019 Glenn declared in his support for he and Adler\u2019s shared stance. Let\u2019s see if the progressive Adler decides to run with Glenn\u2019s support.\"\n\nNext, we reached Adler, whose current biographical entry on a business website says Adler\u2019s candidacy drew \"Beck's first-ever political endorsement.\"\n\nAdler, describing himself as a liberal Democrat, told us that after Beck criticized his ad, his campaign issued the 2011 release saying Beck had endorsed him toward building a pre-election buzz. \"I never saw it as a real official endorsement,\" Adler said though he called back to stress Beck\u2019s statement at the time that California deserved Adler. \"Tongue in cheek or not, one would certainly count it as an endorsement,\" Adler said.\n\nTo our inquiry, Laura Keiter of the liberal Media Matters for America, whose declared mission is to monitor and correct conservative misinformation \"in the U.S. media,\" said by email that while Beck previously made no presidential endorsement, he had made clear who he supported or opposed, \"walking a thin line,\" Keiter said.\n\nKeitor offered instances of Beck seemingly taking a side such as Beck in January 2008 telling Republican hopeful Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor, on the air that he would vote for him or Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney for president. Beck went on to say that if the nominee proved to be former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee or Sen. John McCain (who later proved the nominee), \"I would look at those two guys and go, I can\u2019t do that.\"\n\nIn an October 2010 web post, Media Matters said Beck had repeatedly said he doesn\u2019t endorse candidates yet also had indicated support or opposition to specific hopefuls; that year, Beck urged listeners to oppose Democrat Richard Blumenthal in a Connecticut U.S. Senate race; called Democrat Chris Coons of Nevada a bad Senate candidate; and said he was about to break his no-endorsement policy by endorsing Marco Rubio and another hopeful for the Florida U.S. Senate seat ultimately won by Rubio.\n\nBeck declared in Iowa he hadn\u2019t previously endorsed a candidate.\n\nBeck made a kidding endorsement of a Democrat a few years ago and previously urged support for, or votes against, individuals. But we spotted no evidence of Beck lock-down endorsing a candidate before he stood with Cruz.\n\nTRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate and there\u2019s nothing significant missing.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
