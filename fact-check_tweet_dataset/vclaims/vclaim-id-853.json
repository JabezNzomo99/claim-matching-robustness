We've checked the claims in the campaigns' arguments.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-853", "url": "https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-referendum-voting-guide-vote-leave-eu-law/", "vclaim": "It\u2019s correct that EU laws in areas for which the EU is responsible override any conflicting laws of member countries. The EU court, rather than the UK courts, has the final say on what EU laws mean and whether there is a conflict.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say that the EU controls migration when it comes to the free movement of EU citizens. That\u2019s been largely true since we joined, although the EU court has been important in extending its powers in this area. Control over immigration from other countries mostly remains in the hands of the British government.\n\nTrade is also very much an EU area.\n\nVAT is \u201clargely harmonised\u201d at EU level, according to a major government review from 2013, and the EU sets minimum VAT rates. The UK can change our VAT rates but only if they stay above the EU-wide minimum, and we can keep existing zero rates on products like children\u2019s shoes.\n\nThe EU has a counter-terrorism strategy, and its court has some influence on counter-terrorism in terms of rules on collecting personal data. But as our courts have said, \u201cEU law has not harmonised the law on access to communications data by the police or intelligence services\u201d. The court certainly doesn\u2019t control how the intelligence services operate.", "lang": "en"}
