The debate can be read in Hansard here, and you can watch it in its entirety on parliamentlive.tv here. The moment captured in the Facebook post comes just over two hours into the four hour-plus debate, as Labour MP Alex Cunningham starts speaking.\n\nIt is worth noting that the gathering shown in the image is a \u201ccommittee stage\u201d House of Commons debate. Committee stage bill readings tend to be dealt with by public bill committees, which are usually around 16 to 50 people in size. For this Bill, the Legislative Grand Committee for England was used for committee stage\u2014this is a committee made up of all English MPs.\n\nThe number of MPs seen in the screenshot is not reflective of how many were present at all points during the debate. Compare that image with one from just over an hour later in the same debate, following a vote on one of the proposed amendments:\n\nThe Bill itself is a very short bill that places in law the funding for the NHS in England until March 2024. It is what is known as a \u201cmoney bill\u201d, which the Parliament website says means that \u201ccommittee stage, report stage and third reading are normally formalities\u201d.\n\nThose interested in the NHS Funding Bill and contributions to it by MPs can follow its progress here.", "lang": "en"}
