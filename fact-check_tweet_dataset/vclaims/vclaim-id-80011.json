The claim is false; Modi has never been given that title by UNESCO as the organisation does not have such an award.\n\nThe photo of Modi sitting at a desk has been shared multiple times on Facebook, for example in this post published March 31, 2017, and shared more than 6,000 times since.\n\nThe text on the photo states: \u201cCongratulations to be best prime minister of world. Congratulation to all of us Our PM \u201cNarendra D. Modi\u201d is now declared as the Best PM of the world by UNESCO. Kindly share this. Very proud to be an Indian.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe same photo of Modi has been shared elsewhere on Facebook with a similar claim, for example here, published September 3, 2016, and shared more than 2,800 times.\n\nBut the claim is false; UNESCO has never given an award of \u201cbest prime minister\u201d to Modi or any other political leader.\n\nIn an email to AFP\u2019s Hong Kong bureau on April 4, 2019, Roni Amerlan, the English Editor for UNESCO Press Service, said it had never bestowed such an award.\n\n\u201cI can confirm that UNESCO does not establish rankings of political leaders\u2019 performance or give them distinctions such as \u2018best prime minister,\u201d Amerlan wrote in the email.\n\nA reverse image search on Google revealed the image in the misleading posts had been captured from this report dated June 12, 2013, on the website of news magazine India Today.\n\nThe report\u2019s headline states: \u201cA look at Narendra Modi\u2019s new office\u201d and the photograph is credited to \u201cShailesh Raval / India Today\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo in the misleading Facebook post (l) next to the photo in the India Today report (r):\n\nThe India Today report makes no reference to Modi receiving a UNESCO award.", "lang": "en"}
