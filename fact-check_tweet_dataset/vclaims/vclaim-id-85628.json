Schumer (D-N.Y.) and the Diversity Visa Lottery Program in a series of tweets early on Wednesday morning, after a deadly terrorist attack in New York City the day before. The alleged attacker, Sayfullo Saipov, came to the United States from Uzbekistan under the program, which is more commonly known as the green card lottery.\n\nThe law was aimed at reuniting families, so applicants who had immediate family living in the United States \u2014 children, spouses, siblings, parents \u2014 were given priority. This, however, had some unforeseen consequences. Immigrants from Latin American and Asian countries had come to the United States more recently, and they often had immediate family overseas who were prioritized under the new program. Many Europeans, by contrast, had been in the country for decades, so they had fewer close relatives remaining overseas.\n\nUnlike other European countries, Ireland faced political instability and an economic crisis in the second half of the 20th century. Before 1965, it had been relatively simple for Irish to immigrate. Anne Law, a political science professor at the City University of New York\u2019s Brooklyn College, wrote in a 2002 paper: Ireland had been a \u201chigh quota country with a demand for immigration that was below the supply of visas.\u201d\n\nBy the 1980s, the problem was clear \u2014 tens of thousands of Irish immigrants came to the United States as tourists or students and overstayed their visas. In 1988, the New York Times reported, \u201cAbout 150,000 Irish immigrants came to New York as students or tourists over the last six years and stayed on as undocumented aliens.\u201d\n\nThis was the problem that legislators were trying to fix in the mid- to late 1980s. In 1986, Rep. Brian J. Donnelly (D-Mass.) proposed an amendment to the Immigration and Control Act that would provide a limited number of visas on a first-come, first-served basis to countries \u201cadversely affected\u201d by the 1965 legislation. The offer would be made only once.\n\nAfter the one-off program concluded, Schumer, then a member of the House of Representatives, and others looked for a more permanent solution. In 1990, Schumer put forth a bill that proposed making a set number of visas available each year to \u201cdiversity immigrants\u201d from \u201clow-admission\u201d countries. Despite being couched as a \u201cdiversity\u201d action, it was openly pitched as a way to aid the Irish.\n\nSchumer\u2019s bill was absorbed into broader immigration legislation, which, when it passed the House, Schumer said he was \u201cproud to put together a major portion of the bill that is going to say to Irish, to Poles, to Nigerians: You\u2019re not going to be excluded anymore.\u201d\n\nThe bill passed the Senate. But never made it to the House floor. Then-Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a longtime critic of immigration reform, played a key role in killing it. And his aide at the time, Stephen Miller, according to Politico, literally wrote the handbook that House members used to fight the deal. (Sessions is now attorney general and Miller is a senior adviser in the Trump White House.)\n\nWhen asked about Trump\u2019s tweets, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended the president\u2019s recounting of history, telling reporters, \u201c[Schumer] helped implement, on the front end, long before the Gang of Eight. And the Gang of Eight would have only addressed one part of that problem.\u201d\n\nSchumer did advocate for the diversity visa program in 1990, but Trump\u2019s tweets entirely miss the context in which the program was created. Moreover, it\u2019s not insignificant, as Sanders suggests, that he helped craft a bill that would eliminate it 23 years later. In addition to terminating the program, the immigration bill produced by the Gang of Eight would have increased a merit-based system, which is also included in legislation that the president has said he supports.", "lang": "en"}
