However, Simonyan withheld information about multiple legal charges RT is facing internationally.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "October 01, 2018", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-16039", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/fact-check-russia-simonyan-rt-audience/29519702.html", "vclaim": "In the initial publication of this story, dated October 1, 2018, BBC Spanish audience data was extracted incorrectly from Similarweb.com.\n\nBecause Polygraph.info was not a Similarweb.com subscriber, we were restricted to using data for parent websites. The BBC Spanish website, BBC Mundo, is a \"subfolder\" of the parent BBC website (https://www.bbc.com/mundo), while the RT Spanish website, RT Actualidad, is itself a parent (https://actualidad.rt.com/). Consequently, the 413 million visit figure for BBC Mundo was erroneous, while the 38 million visit figure for RT was correct.\n\nPolygraph.info has since extracted data specific to BBC Mundo using a commercial account. The correct data, as shown below, shows that the audience for BBC Mundo and RT Actualidad, for the March-August 2018 timeframe, is roughly similar, at 11-12 million visits per month.\n\nIt is important to distinguish desktop and mobile traffic, but we cannot effectuate a comparison of the latter between BBC Spanish and RT Spanish due to a lack of data on Similarweb.com.\n\nHowever, because Similarweb.com provides detailed data on desktop traffic, we can conclude with high confidence that the following numbers are accurate:\n\u2022 During the March-August 2018 timeframe, 53% of RT\u2019s global traffic and 56% of BBC\u2019s global traffic was mobile.\n\u2022 During the March-August 2018 timeframe, 67.7% of RT Spanish\u2019s traffic was mobile\n\u2022 Assuming that the behavior of BBC\u2019s and RT\u2019s Spanish-speaking audience was similar, their respective mobile shares should be similar as well:\n\nDespite the findings above, the content of the original fact check means that the verdict for Margarita Simonyan\u2019s statement remains \u201cpartially true;\u201d though she provided accurate information about RT traffic in Arabic and Spanish, RT\u2019s chief editor incorrectly attributed the traffic analyses to IPSOS and withheld information about multiple legal charges RT is facing internationally.\n\nThe information provided above is a correction of the original fact check below:\n\nRT chief editor Margarita Simonyan\u2019s statement, which she made during a call-in program on Ekho Moskvy (Echo of Moscow) radio station, consists of several verifiable claims about the audience for the Russian state media outlet. We have checked each of them separately.\n\nSince Simonyan refers to Ipsos \u2013 a global market research and a consulting firm headquartered in Paris, France \u2013 we first reached out to their press office.\n\nAthanas Jamo, Ipsos senior research manager in Dubai, told Polygraph.info that he was the one who \u201chandled the RT global study.\u201d\n\nJamo confirmed that the two studies, conducted in 2015 and 2017, indeed showed that RT\u2019s weekly viewership is 100 million globally.\n\nHowever, Jamo said the second part of Simonyan\u2019s claim was not part of the study and therefore cannot be attributed to Ipsos.\n\n\u201cIpsos is not measuring the online performances and traffic of RT. As far as I know, their online figures are based on comScore,\u201d Jamo said, referring to the American media measurement and analytics company that provides marketing data and analytics to enterprises, media and advertising agencies, and publishers. We contacted ComScore, but the company had not responded as of the time this fact-check was published.\n\nThere is, however, an open source intelligence tool, Similarweb.com, which makes possible real-time tracking of Website traffic, as well as comparing Websites and providing analyses of both Websites and applications.\n\nSimonyan\u2019s claim that RT in Arabic beat Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya in terms of Website traffic is true for the last six months.\n\nAccording to Similarweb.com\u2019s most recent data, Al Jazeera\u2019s total number of visits during the last six months was 12.99 million, while RT Arabic had 22.98 million visitors during the same period.\n\nRT in Spanish views are higher than those of CNN in Spanish, confirming Simonyan\u2019s claim. The analyses for the last six months show 16.28 million visits for CNN vs 38.68 million for RT in Spanish.\n\nBut the numbers are very much against Simonyan in her claim regarding BBC in Spanish. With its 38.69 million visits, RT\u2019s audience numbers are far below BBC Spanish, which had 413.02 million visits during the last six months.\n\nSimilarweb.com also generates a Global News and Media website ranking, which places BBC at #10 and CNN at #15 among the world\u2019s most visited websites. However, RT is not among the top 50 on the list.\n\nIn addition, RT\u2019s English-language website is no competition to BBC, which had 608.54 million visits during the last six months vs. RT's 166.9 million.\n\nCNN also beat RT English in terms of overall visits over the last six months-- 499.17 million visits vs. RT's 166.9 million visits.\n\nWhile Margarita Simonyan is partially correct about RT\u2019s success with Arabic and Spanish speaking audiences, she gave a misleading answer when a listener questioned her about RT\u2019s credibility.\n\n\u201cWas there any intelligence analyses conducted on how much the foreign viewers trust your channel,\u201d the person identified as \u201cAntosha\u201d asked.\n\nSimonyan responded with the above-analyzed statistics, adding that \u201clegendary Rodger Waters\u201d and \u201cnot less legendary Emir Kusturica\u201d praised RT for its content. She, however, failed to mention the accusations the Russian state broadcaster faces in several countries over its content and its purpose.\n\nAs Polygraph.info has reported, RT faces more than a dozen investigations by the British media watchdog Ofcom into the impartiality of its content.\n\nIn the United States, RT stands accused of efforts to undermine the electoral process as part of an investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. A Polygraph.info investigation into RT\u2019s FARA (Foreign Agent Registration Act) registration found that RT falsely stated its purpose in publishing overseas. Polygraph.info revealed the outlet\u2019s Russian government ownership, hidden under the umbrella of a non-profit organization.", "lang": "en"}
