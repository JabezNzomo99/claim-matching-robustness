Those advocating brotherhood and secularism won't see this'.\n\nYou can watch the video below and find its archived version can be accessed here.\n\nBOOM found the same video on Facebook as well albeit with a different claim. The caption accompanying the video here reads 'Dalits and Muslims join hands in Agra to take out the largest protest rally against Tabrez Ansari's lynching. If you want to live in India, you'll have to say Allah-hu-Akbar.'\n\nYou can view the post below and access its archived version here.\n\nBOOM had earlier debunked a similar fake claim involving a Muharram procession and provocative sloganeering. Read our report below.\n\nVideo Purporting To Show Crowd Calling To Avenge Tabrez Ansari's Death Is Doctored\n\nWe sifted through the comments section of the video and found some comments which mentioned that the video is that of a Muharram procession and the slogans have been added after editing.\n\nWe then narrowed down our search for Muharram videos in India. Several searches with different key words later, BOOM finally found a longer version of the same video shot in 2014 in Bihar's Gopalganj.\n\nThe original video has no such slogans as heard in the viral video.\n\nThe audio has been lifted from a video BOOM had debunked earlier.\n\nThe original video is from a rally in Udaipur, Rajasthan, in December 2017 when Muslims in large numbers had turned up at Chetak Circle to protest against Shambulal Regar, who had brutally murdered Mohammed Afrazul, a Muslim labourer.\n\nDid Congress Workers Shout Communal Slogans In Rajasthan After Poll Win?", "lang": "en"}
