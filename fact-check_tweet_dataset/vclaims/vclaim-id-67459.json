Also, Staples\u2019 cited arrest and confiscation totals reflected Drawbridge\u2019s overall results.\n\nIn an interview, Staples told us his statement was intended to reflect totals for the entire program and he\u2019s never said all the results were due to Agriculture Department aid. Staples also stressed that his email blast said the agency\u2019s savings \"helped\" achieve the results. \"I don\u2019t want to get popped for something I\u2019ve never taken credit for,\" he said.\n\nThe state\u2019s Department of Public Safety started Drawbridge in January 2012, according to its . DPS spokesman Tom Vinger told us by email that Agriculture Department grants in October 2012 and August 2013 provided $345,000 to the program.\n\nThe main source of Drawbridge funding, Vinger said, is the Criminal Justice Division of the Governor\u2019s Office, which has so far provided grants totaling $2.5 million.\n\nA description of the initiative from a June 9, 2012, San Antonio Express-News said, \"(T)he department is installing 500 cameras along the border, part of an electronic monitoring program called Operation Drawbridge. It's an update of the much-criticized Texas Border Watch Program, a multimillion-dollar effort by the state to set up video cameras along the border. It was recently canceled after only a few dozen cameras were put in place over more than three years and unimpressive results.\"\n\nA 2013 DPS placed online illustrates how Drawbridge uses modified off-the-shelf, motion-sensing, low-light cameras of the type hunters use to spot and track game at all hours. Farmers and ranchers volunteer to have the $300 cameras placed on their land near the Texas/Mexico border. Once an image is captured, software transmits it to law enforcement, and response times can be as quick as 10 minutes, according to the presentation.\n\nStaples has long warned that because of a lack of border security, farmers and ranchers are under siege. His campaign spokesman, Bryan Black, told us via email that Staples helped bring landowner organizations into Operation Drawbridge.\n\nStaples told us his involvement with border security issues arose in response to landowners asking him for help.\n\nBlack said the grants came from agency savings in fiscal year 2013. Agriculture Department spokeswoman Lindsey Pope emailed us a with the agency\u2019s \"lapsed appropriations,\" money budgeted by lawmakers but ultimately unspent, in each biennium from 2006-07 through 2012-13. It showed the total returned to the state treasury in 2012-13 was $10.3 million.\n\nDPS spokesman Vinger sent us web links to his agency\u2019s Oct. 11, 2012, on the $225,000 grant and Aug. 8, 2013, on the $120,000 grant.\n\nThe 2012 release said, \"Operation Drawbridge is fully operational today with hundreds of cameras located along the border. This funding will essentially double the number of cameras involved in the program.\"\n\nDrawbridge was operating 750 cameras as of June 30, 2013, according to the online DPS presentation.\n\nLegislative Budget Board staff spokesman John Barton emailed us a Sept. 28, 2012, between the agencies stating that the $225,000 grant was \"for the funding of additional DPS remote motion-sensing cameras, installation and monitoring activities associated with the surveillance along the border, particularly in those areas of the Texas-Mexico border where illegal activity and border violence have adversely affected rural landowners and the Texas agriculture industry.\"\n\nAn Aug. 8, 2013, McAllen Monitor said, \"The $120,000 grant is for DPS to expand the program by purchasing more motion-sensing cameras.\"\n\nFrom January 2012 through December 2013, according to Vinger and the DPS , Drawbridge \"resulted in the apprehension of more than 22,950 individuals and more than 50 tons of narcotics.\"\n\nThe October 2012 press release announcing the first Department of Agriculture grant said Drawbridge had \"resulted in the apprehension of approximately 4,000 individuals and 10 tons of narcotics since January 2012.\"\n\nSo it would appear that at least 18,950 people and 40 tons of narcotics were captured from Oct. 11, 2012, through Dec. 31, 2013.\n\nSome supporting detail comes from the 2013 DPS conference presentation:\n\nStaples said savings he achieved helped fund cameras on the border and that as a result, more than 21,500 arrests were made and 46 tons of narcotics were confiscated.\n\nThis statement could leave the misleading impression that a few hundred thousand dollars committed on Staples\u2019 watch to an established program near the border culminated in the touted arrests and confiscations.\n\nIt\u2019s documented that the grant money supported the border effort. But we don\u2019t see a way to tie particular arrests and confiscations to the grants. Also, this statement leaves out the critical fact that about 90 percent of the operation\u2019s funding has come from federal aid awarded through the governor\u2019s office.\n\nWe rate this claim as Half True.\n\nHALF TRUE \u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\n\nClick here for on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
