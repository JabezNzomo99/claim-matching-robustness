It is not from Dadar, Mumbai as claimed. We spoke to Vijayraj Surve, Divisional Forest Officer, Ratnagiri who confirmed that the crocodile was captured in Chiplun. \u201cThere is an area called Dadar in Chiplun, which is probably why the confusion arose in the first place. The crocodile was rescued on July 26 after the Forest Department received information that a crocodile was spotted inside a drain.\u201d Chiplun is roughly 320 kilometres south of Mumbai.\n\nIt may be reiterated that the video of the crocodile being rescued from a drain is from Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra and not from Dadar, Mumbai.", "lang": "en"}
