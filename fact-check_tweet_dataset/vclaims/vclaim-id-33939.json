AFP spoke to the photographer who took the picture, who said it actually shows Eritreans tortured in Egypt\u2019s Sinai peninsula.\n\nThe image has been shared more than 5,000 times on Facebook since November 21 -- we\u2019ve archived a few of the different posts here, here and here.\n\nIn the shocking picture, three gaunt-looking young men stand against a wall. Two of them have large wounds across their bodies.\n\n\u201cModern Day Slavery. Happening right now in Libya,\u201d the captions read.\n\nAs fact-checking site Snopes reported in 2017, Nigerian politician Femi Fani-Kayode also shared the claim in a tweet which has since been deleted. At the time, a CNN investigation showing that Africans had been filmed being sold at auction in Libya was causing shock and condemnation around the world.\n\nDespite being wracked by conflict since the 2011 uprising that killed dictator Moamer Kadhafi, Libya has remained a major transit route for migrants, especially from sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nAccording to figures from the United Nations\u2019 refugee agency UNHCR in November, more than 4,400 people are currently held in official detention centres in Libya, often in appalling conditions.\n\nThere are no figures for the number of people held in illegal centres run by human traffickers, where detainees are subject to torture in a bid to extort money from their families.\n\nHowever, the picture widely shared on social media shows Eritreans who were tortured in Egypt\u2019s Sinai peninsula, not victims of \u201cslavery\u201d in Libya.\n\nAFP ran a reverse image search on the photo, which led to an article on French site Les Inrockuptibles from 2015. The article, which features the picture, talks about an award-winning documentary by film-makers C\u00e9cile Allegra and Delphine Deloget about Eritreans trafficked in the Sinai peninsula.\n\nThe documentary, \u201cVoyage en barbarie\u201d (here in French) tells the stories of Eritreans kidnapped from Sudanese migrant camps and taken across the border to Egypt\u2019s Sinai peninsula, where they were held and subjected to torture such as electrocution, burning and rape in a bid to extort money from their families.\n\nEgypt\u2019s arid Sinai region became a major route for migrants slipping into Israel illegally in 2007 thanks to its then-porous border.\n\nThe influx has since halted as Egyptian forces increased monitoring of the region in the wake of activity from Islamic State group jihadists and a high-tech fence was installed on the frontier with Israel.\n\nIn the documentary, we can clearly see a screenshot of the photograph of the three men just before the 53-minute mark, where two of them describe being rescued from their captors by locals.\n\n\u201cI realised we were free when they took our chains off. They helped us get up. I was so thin they had to carry me to the car,\u201d said the young man pictured on the left.\n\nContacted by AFP, C\u00e9cile Allegra, one of the film-makers who made the documentary, said the photo featured two of the men who took part in her film.\n\n\u201cThe use of this photo is obviously problematic, because it\u2019s nothing to do with Libya, but the Sinai,\u201d she said via telephone.\n\nShe said that one of the men pictured was now living in Egypt, while the other two had been brought to France \u201cthanks to an exceptional mobilisation\u201d. She did not give their names, in order to protect their identities.\n\nAllegra said the photo was taken by French journalist Baptiste de Cazenove, who later confirmed this to AFP. He sent us an article he wrote for Lib\u00e9ration newspaper in 2014, \u201cSinai: the desert of torture\u201d. The online version of the article does not feature the image, but it appears in the print version, which de Cazenove sent us by email.\n\nThe article credits both the text and photographs to de Cazenove.\n\n\u201cThe photograph was taken in Cairo in June 2013 in an apartment in Ard el-Lewa, a working-class district where lots of refugees live,\u201d he told AFP by phone.\n\n\u201cThe men are Eritreans who were kidnapped in Sudan and forcibly taken to the Sinai, where they were tortured and detained,\u201d he said.\n\nThe men told him they were \u201chung from the ceiling\u201d and \u201cburned with a hot iron or with melted plastic\u201d.\n\nAround a dozen torture survivors were staying in the apartment in Cairo, where they received medical treatment from aid workers, de Cazenove said.\n\nRights groups say that tightened monitoring and border controls in the Sinai region have led to a drop in human trafficking rates there.\n\n\"Sinai is no longer a major migration route since 2014, following increased monitoring by Egypt security forces as a result of growing terrorist organizations/activity in the Sinai Peninsula, and closure of the Israeli border to migrants,\" Fisseha Tekle, Amnesty International\u2019s researcher for Ethiopia and Eritrea, told us by email.", "lang": "en"}
