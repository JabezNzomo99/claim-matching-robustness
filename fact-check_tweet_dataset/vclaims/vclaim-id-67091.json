The finished product bore a Kinemaster watermark and carried text commentary negating Roxas\u2019 remarks.\n\nThe post also carried a deceptive thumbnail: a cropped version of The Philippine Star\u2019s photo of Roxas filing his certificate of candidacy in October 2018. The altered photo had the concocted text \u201cTatakbo ako sa 2022 (I will run in 2022)\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t quite (sic) On our country\u201d pasted onto the document he was holding up.\n\nThe fake post was uploaded last April 13 but gained traction again this August, potentially reaching more than 2.4 million people. This came shortly after Vice President Leni Robredo, Roxas\u2019 running mate in the 2016 polls, reacted to calls for a revolutionary government on Aug. 23. In a separate account, election lawyer Romulo Macalintal said if President Rodrigo Duterte heeds the call and declares a \u201cRevGov,\u201d Robredo will become the new chief executive.\n\nPublic FB groups Mayor Inday Sara Duterte International Movement, ISUMBONG MO KAY TATAY DIGONG, and Isko Moreno Supporters Group generated the most traffic to the post this month, with their comments sections showing netizens cursing Roxas and saying he was campaigning too early.\n\nOyod Official TV was created on Feb. 13, 2016. It posts a hodgepodge of content ranging from politics-themed videos, eating vlogs to health tips.\n\n(Editor's Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.
