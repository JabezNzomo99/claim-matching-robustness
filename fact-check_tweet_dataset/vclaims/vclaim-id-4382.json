The conversation supposedly started with Duterte telling Tagle, \u201cYour job is to educate the faithful, my job is to eradicate those who are killing the faithful.\u201d\n\n\n\nWithin the same day, the post was shared 3,662 times and garnered 2,900 likes and reactions.\n\nThe claim was posted by 3 other blogs, one of which was posted in 8 Facebook pages and groups and had 2,621 interactions and 1,008,534 followers.\n\nThe second claim was posted by another Facebook page named, \u201cSocial News Media\u201d on June 26. It garnered 7,419 shares and 2,400 likes and reactions. It is a photo of Tagle with a quote where the Cardinal supposedly suggested that the church could lead the country better than the State. It also supposedly asked for assistance in battling \u201cdictator Duterte.\u201d\n\nThe facts: The Cardinal\u2019s office confirmed that both statements are fake. \u201cI categorically state that these two memes are fake. These are not statements made by Cardinal Tagle,\u201d Father Reginald Malicdem, private secretary of Tagle, told Rappler.\n\nThis is not the first time the first meme came up. In December 2016, a Facebook page named, \u201cPresident Mayor Duterte of the Philippines in Negros,\u201d published the same meme. That earlier post had a higher engagement rate: 28,480 shares and 41,000 likes and reactions.\n\nThe Duterte-Tagle exchange from BOSS received comments that were either admiring Duterte's jabs against Tagle or attacks to Tagle and the Catholic Church. Below is a screengrab showing the top 4 comments.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of the two Facebook pages, BOSS and Social News Media, is a mix of pro-Duterte stories, gossip, and humor posts.
