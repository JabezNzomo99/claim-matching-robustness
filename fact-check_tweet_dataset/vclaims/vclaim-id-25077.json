But, as we wrote last month, economists told us there are not enough new benefits to the U.S. in the new trade agreement \u2014 which has yet to be ratified by Congress \u2014 to pay for the wall.\n\u2022 In the same tweet, Trump falsely claimed that \u201cMuch of the Wall has already been renovated or built.\u201d Very little new fencing has been constructed under Trump, and none of it is the type he promised during the campaign.\n\u2022 At a cabinet meeting, Trump claimed the wall \u201cprobably would pay for itself in a month or two because we lose pretty close to $250 billion on illegal immigration.\u201d There is no support for that figure, which is double another disputed estimate from a conservative group. Plus, such figures are for immigrants already living in the country illegally.\n\u2022 The president also repeated his claim that the wall is needed to \u201chalt [the] deadly inflow of drugs,\u201d even though experts \u2014 including those within his administration \u2014 say the vast majority of illicit drugs from Mexico escapes undetected in cars and trucks traveling through legal ports of entry.\n\nTrump met on Jan. 2 with congressional leaders to discuss a partial government shutdown that started at midnight on Dec. 21. House Republicans amended the Senate-approved version of a continuing budget resolution, which covers seven appropriations bills for fiscal year 2019, to add more than $5 billion for the president\u2019s border wall, at Trump\u2019s request.\n\nDemocrats have refused to support the president\u2019s demand, resulting in a stalemate that shuttered parts of the federal government.\n\nPrior to his meeting, Trump tweeted about the shutdown and discussed it at a cabinet meeting.\n\nIn his morning tweet, Trump continued to insist that he is keeping his campaign promise to have Mexico pay for a border wall \u201cthrough the new USMCA Trade Deal.\u201d\n\nBut as we wrote on Dec. 14, there is nothing in the USMCA spelling out that Mexico will pay for any border wall. The president\u2019s argument is that Mexico will pay \u201cindirectly\u201d because of benefits that accrue to the U.S. through the new trade agreement. But economists told us there are not enough new benefits to the U.S. in the new trade agreement to pay for the wall.\n\n\u201cEven if we accept conceptually the argument that government revenue attributable to the revised trade agreement constitutes \u2018Mexico paying for the wall,\u2019 there are no plausible assumptions of USMCA\u2019s impact that would see government revenue increase by $25 billion,\u201d said Geoffrey Gertz, a fellow in the Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution and a research associate at the Global Economic Governance Programme at the University of Oxford.\n\n\u201cUltimately USMCA is very similar to NAFTA, and so we shouldn\u2019t expect any substantial economic shifts from the new agreement,\u201d Gertz told us via email. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to argue that that NAFTA was \u2018anti-USA\u2019 and \u2018very costly\u2019 but that USMCA will save us lots of money, because there\u2019s not a huge difference between the two agreements.\u201d\n\nKent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, told us none of the concessions won by U.S. negotiators amounts to enough to offset the cost of a border wall.\n\n\u201cRelative to NAFTA, the Mexican government would not nearly lose enough tariff revenue that could be constituted as paying for the wall, at least the wall as previously envisioned by the Administration; nor would the U.S. government revenue increase enough based on a dynamic score,\u201d said Smetters, who was an economist at the Congressional Budget Office in the 1990s. \u201cIn fact, the additional revenue to U.S. relative to NAFTA would, optimistically, not cover annual maintenance and improvements of the wall much less the original build.\u201d\n\nIs \u2018Much of the Wall\u2019 Already Built?\n\nThe president also inflated the progress of wall construction to date when he tweeted that \u201cMuch of the Wall has already been fully renovated or built.\u201d\n\nAccording to Customs and Border Protection, the fiscal year 2017 border security program included:\n\u2022 San Diego Primary Replacement Project (14 miles). So far, 9 miles of the project have been completed, and the rest remains on schedule to be completed in May 2019.\n\u2022 El Paso Primary Fence Replacement Project (4 miles). So far, 2 miles have been completed, with the remaining scheduled to be completed in late April 2019.\n\nThat is almost all replacement of existing fencing, and the new barriers are not the type of concrete barriers Trump talked about during the campaign and are not like any of the wall prototypes the president unveiled early last year. For more on this, see our story \u201cHas the Border Wall Begun?\u201c\n\nMoreover, the projects listed above are just a fraction of the CBP\u2019s request early last year for 722 miles of new and replacement fencing at 17 of its top priority locations along the border. CBP estimated the cost of that fencing \u2014 316 miles of new barriers and 407 miles of replacement or secondary fencing \u2014 at $18 billion over 10 years, though a report from the Government Accountability Office in July warned it would likely cost more than that.\n\nSo the fencing constructed to date along the border is just a fraction of what Trump was ultimately seeking.\n\nCongress last year approved $1.6 billion to replace existing barriers and add some fencing in new areas. In December, CBP officials told us it was in the process of building these FY18-funded projects:\n\u2022 25 miles of new levee wall in the Rio Grande Valley\n\u2022 8-12 miles of Bollard Wall also in the Rio Grande Valley\n\u2022 14 miles of secondary wall in San Diego (most of it replacing existing wall)\n\u2022 48 miles of pedestrian replacement wall in other areas (multiple sectors)\n\nBut those sections are in the works, so it would be inaccurate for the president to include them among the projects \u201calready\u201d finished. Even if included, however, those in-the-works sections still represent far fewer miles than what the Trump administration previously identified as needed.\n\nTo end the shutdown, Trump has demanded Democrats agree to the House-approved spending plan that would add $5.7 billion for border barriers. Democrats support a plan that includes $1.3 billion for border security. Last summer, though, Democrats supported a measure that would provide $1.6 billion for border security, including 65 miles of new pedestrian fencing, though not any of the types of wall previously proposed by Trump.\n\nIn a Jan. 2 cabinet meeting, Trump claimed that the wall would \u201csave money\u201d and \u201cprobably would pay for itself in a month or two because we lose pretty close to $250 billion on illegal immigration.\u201d We don\u2019t know the source for the president\u2019s figure, which is more than double a questionable figure he cited during the 2016 campaign.\n\nOther studies have estimated a modest cost of illegal immigration for state and local governments, and a net positive gain for the federal budget. More important, these estimates \u2014 even if they were right \u2014 are for immigrants living illegally in the United States; the wall wouldn\u2019t cause these immigrants to be deported.\n\nIn late August 2016, Trump claimed that illegal immigration cost \u201cmore than $113 billion a year,\u201d an estimate from the conservative Federation for American Immigration Reform. As we wrote then, that estimate was for costs only \u2014 FAIR said the net cost, factoring in tax payments from immigrants living in the country illegally, was $99 billion. It included the cost of public education and health care, such as through Medicaid, for the U.S.-born children of these immigrants, but it didn\u2019t include tax payments by those children once they became adults. The estimate also included federal costs for immigration enforcement and prosecution.\n\nFAIR has since updated the figure to $116 billion net. But the libertarian Cato Institute has disputed that, calling the estimate \u201cfatally flawed.\u201d Alex Nowrasteh, a senior immigration policy analyst at Cato, wrote in September 2017 that \u201c[m]erely using the correct numbers\u201d on tax rates, the illegal immigrant population and the impact on property values would lower the net cost to $3.3 billion to $15.6 billion.\n\nFAIR had used an estimate of 12.5 million immigrants in the country illegally. The latest estimate from the Pew Research Center is 10.7 million unauthorized immigrants in 2016, down from the peak of 12.2 million in 2007.\n\nBut again, the wall or other border security wouldn\u2019t do anything about immigrants who are already living in the country illegally. Also, a growing proportion of those immigrants came to the U.S. legally and overstayed the time limits on their visas. The Department of Homeland Security said in a February 2018 press release that \u201cvisa overstays account for roughly 40 percent of all illegal immigration in the United States.\u201d\n\nAmong the other estimates of the cost of illegal immigration: A 2007 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office concluded that the net impact on state and local budgets was \u201cmost likely modest,\u201d and a 1997 report by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences found that the long-run fiscal impact of most immigrants, regardless of legal status, would be \u201cstrongly positive at the federal level.\u201d\n\nIn March 2018, Trump cited a report by the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates low immigration, to claim the wall would pay for itself. But CIS estimated a savings of $12 billion to $15 billion over the average lifetime of illegal border-crossers that could be stopped by a wall over the next decade.\n\nThe report extrapolated data from another report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. But several of the authors of the NAS report say the data were misused by CIS. For more, see our March story \u201cWill Trump\u2019s Wall Pay for Itself?\u201d\n\nAt the cabinet meeting, Trump also repeated his claim that the wall is needed to \u201chalt [the] deadly inflow of drugs,\u201d even though experts \u2014 including those within his administration \u2014 say the vast majority of heroin from Mexico escapes undetected in cars and trucks traveling through legal ports of entry.\n\nTrump is right that about 300 Americans on average die of heroin overdoses every week. There were an estimated 15,482 heroin overdoses in 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nHe is also right that the majority of heroin comes across the Southern border. The 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment, issued in October by the Drug Enforcement Administration, says: \u201cHeroin from Mexico accounted for 86 percent of the heroin by weight analyzed through the HSP in 2016.\u201d The Heroin Signature Program, or HSP, analyzes seized drugs to determine geographic origins of heroin.\n\nBut experts, including those within his own administration, say the vast majority of the illegal heroin enters the U.S. through legal ports of entry.\n\nThe 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment says the Southwest border \u201cremains the primary entry point for heroin into the United States.\u201d But it says \u201cthe majority of the [heroin] flow\u201d comes through legal ports of entry in privately owned vehicles and tractor-trailers.\n\nWhen we first wrote about this subject in August 2017, Stephen D. Morris, a Middle Tennessee State University political science professor whose research has largely focused on Mexico, told us, \u201cThe wall will not do very much to stop drugs.\u201d Similarly, Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told us, \u201cThe wall won\u2019t stop the flow of drugs into the United States.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
