She calls it a \"sweetheart deal\" for drug companies, saying the government can\u2019t use its bargaining power to try and obtain lower drug prices -- although others counter that competition among private insurers in Part D has led to lower prices.\n\n \n\n We\u2019ve rated True a claim by Baldwin that the Part D law, \"adopted under Thompson\u2019s watch,\" bars the government from negotiating for \"better prices\" on prescription drugs. At the time, six weeks before the second debate with Baldwin, Thompson\u2019s campaign said nothing about the non-interference clause being the Democrats\u2019 doing.\n\n \n\n That\u2019s a different claim.\n\n \n\n Let\u2019s check it out.\n\n \n\n Thompson\u2019s case\n\n \n\n Medicare Part D is an optional insurance program for prescription drugs for people on Medicare. A key feature is that private insurance companies offer a variety of plans and beneficiaries choose the plan that's best for them. The government subsidizes the program but does not run it.\n\n \n\n Medical Part D was created by the Medicare Modernization Act, which also made other changes to Medicare. It was proposed by President George W. Bush, and Thompson was the administration\u2019s point man on lobbying Congress to create it.\n\n \n\n When we asked for evidence to back Thompson\u2019s claim that others were responsible for non-interference, his campaign did not respond. But Thompson expounded on his claim both in the second and third debates and in a meeting with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editors and reporters on the day of the second debate.\n\n \n\n Thompson said non-interference was first introduced by Clinton and Democratic congressional leaders in a Medicare Part D proposal in 1999, which did not become law.\n\n \n\n Thompson also maintained that when the Bush administration proposed Part D, it contained only general principles. He said non-interference became part of the law only after it was introduced by then-Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., and Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.\n\n \n\n \"I had nothing to do with it, never had a sweetheart deal with anybody,\" he told the Journal Sentinel.\n\n \n\n The record\n\n \n\n The Clinton Part D proposal did, as Thompson said, include a non-interference clause. But the language differs from that in the Medicare Part D that later became law under Bush.\n\n \n\n Under the Clinton proposal, pharmacy benefit managers would have negotiated on behalf of the federal government with drug manufacturers, said Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nBut in Bush\u2019s Part D, the government can\u2019t negotiate at all, leaving negotiation up to the individual insurance plans.\n\n \n\n Park agreed with Thompson that Bush\u2019s Part D proposal was a set of principles and not legislation. But while Democrat Baucus was very involved in the Part D legislation, Republicans controlled both the Senate and the House, Park noted.\n\n \n\n As for Thompson\u2019s claim that he had \"nothing to do\" with the non-interference clause that ended up in the law, that didn\u2019t wash with Park or other experts we interviewed.\n\n \n\n \"Any time Congress is involved in major legislation, the administration is heavily involved,\" said Park.\n\n \n\n Grace-Marie Turner, president of the Galen Institute, a think tank that promotes free market principles in health care, said the Bush administration clearly supported non-interference to promote competition among private insurers and keep the government out of setting drug prices.\n\n \n\n \"It\u2019s really the key element to allowing this competitive marketplace to work,\" said Turner, who noted that Medicare Part D has cost less than was anticipated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\n \n\n Indeed, in 2007, when Democrats pushed legislation to repeal non-interference, Bush threatened a veto, arguing that competition among insurers was resulting in lower drug prices.\n\n \n\n Our rating\n\n \n\n Thompson said Democrats first proposed prohibiting the government from negotiating prices for prescription drugs in Medicare Part D and he \"had nothing to do with\" that provision in the final law.\n\n \n\n Democrats did introduce a version of the so-called non-interference provision, but it didn\u2019t go as far as the provision that became law under Bush. Moreover, Thompson was the point man on Medicare Part D for the Bush administration, which supported non-interference.\n\n \n\n We rate Thompson\u2019s statement Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
