It says that Legleitner was sentenced to two years in jail while Lloyd was sentenced to 26 years in prison \u2014 both by Circuit Court Judge Sherwood Bauer Jr. in the 19th Circuit in Martin County.\n\nThe claim gets the basic facts correct, but it omits an additional difference in the white defendant\u2019s case.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) A similar graphic has circulated at least since 2018.\n\nThis claim was also shared by various celebrities commenting on racial injustice in June following the death of George Floyd in police custody.\n\nMeme stems from \u2018Bias on the Bench\u2019 series\n\nThe juxtaposition of the two robbery cases is from the Sarasota Herald-Tribune\u2019s award-winning 2016 \"Bias on the Bench\" series. The newspaper examined millions of court documents on crimes in Florida from 2004 through 2016. The investigation concluded that blacks are more likely to be found guilty than whites and usually get longer sentences.\n\nOne article used the sentences for Legleitner and Lloyd as an example to show that Bauer sentenced African Americans to longer terms. Bauer told the newspaper that race is of \"complete insignificance\" in his treatment of defendants.\n\nHere are the basic facts of the two cases: Legleitner robbed men in a 2008 drug deal. Lloyd robbed a Pizza Hut and gas station the following year. Both men pleaded no contest to two counts of armed robbery and had open pleas, which means they weren\u2019t promised a particular sentence. Each had a single misdemeanor on his record and tallied the same point total on scoresheets used to determine incarceration time. Based on their score of 138 points, the state\u2019s guidelines called for a sentence of just under seven years to life in prison.\n\nBauer sentenced Lloyd to 26 years in prison in 2010, and the following year sentenced Legleitner to about two years in jail, including time already served.\n\nDavid Lustgarten, the assistant state attorney who prosecuted Legleitner, told PolitiFact that the defendants\u2019 point totals on the scoresheet don\u2019t tell the full story. Lustgarten said he was familiar with the facts of Lloyd\u2019s case.\n\nLegleitner, he said, was one of about a half dozen defendants who were involved in a scheme to approach other men under the guise of buying drugs, but planned to rob them. Legleitner helped the prosecution build the case against the co-defendants who were armed, including testifying against one at trial.\n\n\"I told Judge Bauer at sentencing that without his testimony I would have never secured a conviction against the two bad actors,\" Lustgarten said.\n\nThe Herald-Tribune article alluded to the fact that Legleitner cooperated when it stated that \"the prosecutor lobbied hard for leniency.\"\n\nLloyd\u2019s was a \"clear-cut case,\" said Adam Guzi, who prosecuted Lloyd and recommended a 30-year sentence. Guzi said he had witness accounts from the Pizza Hut and the Sunoco gas station as well as another witness who had spotted the defendants appearing to inspect another restaurant earlier. Prosecutors didn\u2019t need Lloyd\u2019s cooperation to convict the other man, Guzi said.\n\nLloyd\u2019s defense attorney, J.D. Lewis IV, said he thought that his client\u2019s sentence was outrageous at the time.\n\nBut asked about the role of race in Lloyd\u2019s sentencing, he told PolitiFact, \"I can\u2019t personally say there is evidence that race was a factor.\"\n\nIn general though, Lewis said he believes that there are racial disparities in the criminal-justice system. \"I would be naive to think racism does not play a part in the criminal justice system,\" he said.\n\nFollowing the Herald-Tribune\u2019s series, the 12th judicial circuit wrote a rebuttal, which included an analysis of the two robbery cases handled by Bauer in the 19th circuit. Bauer\u2019s office directed us to part of the rebuttal written by Diamond Litty, public defender for the 19th circuit (Legleitner and Lloyd both had private counsel.)\n\nThe public defender pointed to Lustgarten\u2019s testimony at the sentencing hearing that Legleitner was \"morally cooperative, honest, forthright, and remorseful.\"\n\nThe public defender also noted that Legleitner stole from someone who was a drug user or dealer, while Lloyd stole from employees at work.\n\nWe sent a summary of our findings to Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project, a criminal justice advocacy group.\n\nMauer questioned why states have a complex scoring system in their sentencing guidelines if it doesn\u2019t pick up significant case distinctions.\n\n\"In this case, essentially the black defendant gets sentenced by the guidelines system and the white defendant gets the benefit of wide-ranging judicial discretion,\" he said. \"This doesn't necessarily mean that the white defendant \u2018got off too easy\u2019\u2014 just as likely that the black defendant got punished too severely.\"\n\nProsecutors have long recommended a reduced sentence in exchange for a defendant\u2019s cooperation, Mauer said. But in the era of mandatory sentences and enhanced prosecutorial power, the scale of that benefit has increased dramatically.\n\n\"So defendants who don't have information to trade or wish to contest the charges are faced with the prospect of a dramatically higher sentence for the same conduct as another who chooses to plead guilty,\" he said.\n\nA 2000 research report by the National Institute of Justice, a federal agency, concluded that despite decades of reform efforts, in some jurisdictions, blacks and Hispanics received longer sentences or differential benefits from guideline departures than similarly situated white offenders.\n\nThe disparities appeared in Southern and non-Southern jurisdictions, in state and federal court systems, and in jurisdictions with and without sentencing guidelines.\n\nA Facebook post said a white armed robbery suspect was sentenced to two years in jail while a black armed robbery suspect was sentenced to 26 years in prison by the same Florida judge in two separate cases.\n\nThe post gets the basic facts correct: The two defendants both pleaded no contest to the same crime, both had one prior misdemeanor and both scored the same number of points on a system designed to calculate their sentences.\n\nBut prosecutors said the white defendant got a reduced sentence after cooperating with prosecutors to convict co-defendants, a fact that\u2019s not mentioned in the graphic.\n\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.", "lang": "en"}
