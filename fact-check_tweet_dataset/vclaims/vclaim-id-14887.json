Bernie Sanders saying, \u201cI think this country has had enough with white men in places of power. It\u2019s time for a change and with your help I can be that change.\u201d\n\nAlthough Sanders has vowed to make his campaign \u2013 and if elected president, his cabinet \u2013 diverse, there is no evidence he ever made this statement.\n\nSanders, who is one of more than a dozen candidates running for president in 2020, outraised all of his Democratic rivals in the first quarter of 2019 and is widely considered a front runner.\n\nSanders has vowed to make racial diversity more of a priority for his 2020 campaign after he was criticized for not doing enough to reach black voters in 2016.\n\n\u201cThis time, we\u2019re starting from a different position,\u201d he said during an interview on The Breakfast Club radio show in March. \u201cWe were criticized for being too white, that was a correct criticism. We were criticized for being too male, that was a correct criticism. That\u2019s going to change.\u201d\n\nSanders has also promised his cabinet would \u201clook like America\u201d if he were elected president.\n\nHowever, The Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence that Sanders ever made the statement attributed to him in the meme. A spokesperson for his campaign told TheDCNF in an email that she was unaware of any such statement.\n\nThe meme includes the Fox News logo in the bottom-left corner, but a Fox News spokesperson told TheDCNF the meme did not originate with them.\n\nWhen asked during the Breakfast Club interview whether he thought the U.S. needed another white male president, Sanders responded by saying, \u201cWell, I think you need this one.\u201d\n\nHe recently rejected the idea that the 2020 Democratic nominee should be chosen based on race or gender.\n\n\u201cWe have got to look at candidates, you know, not by the color of their skin, not by their sexual orientation or their gender and not by their age,\u201d said Sanders during a February interview on Vermont Public Radio. \u201cI mean, I think we have got to try to move us toward a non-discriminatory society which looks at people based on their abilities, based on what they stand for.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
