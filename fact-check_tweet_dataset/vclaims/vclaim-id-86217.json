The U.S. economy has added almost 4.9 million jobs since Trump became president, but regular readers know we would frown on the idea that any president himself \u201ccreated\u201d these jobs.\n\nThe president, as he noted a few moments later, was referring to the White House\u2019s \u201cPledge to America\u2019s Workers.\u201d Under the auspices of a workforce policy advisory board co-chaired by Ivanka Trump, about 200 companies have pledged to offer more than 6.5 million training opportunities to workers over the next five years.\n\nThe United States lags behind many other industrialized nations in the efforts it devotes to skill training and reskilling workers, so it\u2019s an important issue. The White House has a snazzy Web page to promote the list of companies.\n\nNotice we said \u201ctraining opportunities,\u201d not jobs. But this is how the president described it: \u201cThese are jobs that, for the most part, would not have happened.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not the case, but he might have gotten confused because of the way Ivanka has talked about it. \u201cWe\u2019re up to 6.3 million new jobs,\u201d she said at a White House event Oct. 31. \u201cThat represents 5 percent of the current workforce. So it\u2019s really remarkable.\u201d\n\nIn fact, as CNN has documented, many of these companies and organizations were already planning to offer these retraining programs. It\u2019s good that the White House has gotten the numbers on record. But it\u2019s not the same thing as something new.\n\n\u201cMost of these training programs already existed at the point of the July pledge signing,\u201d AGC spokesman Brian Turmail said. But, he said, \u201cthese figures certainly represent an increase over current training numbers and reflect the fact that our association, including our chapters and member firms, expects to train more people to fill future demand than we currently train.\u201d\n\n\u201cABC and its member companies educate and upskill more than 476,000 people across all industry positions annually, including craft professionals, field managers and leadership in technical, safety and craft-based skills,\u201d said Greg Sizemore, ABC vice president of health, safety, environment and workforce development. \u201cWe pledged to create enhanced career opportunities for 500,000 workers during the next five years.\u201d\n\nUpdate: In response to this fact check, a White House official said that Ivanka Trump\u2019s efforts also include winning the reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, making more than $1 billion available for career education programs and reaching more than 11 million students, a presidential directive telling the Department of Education to devote at least $200 million in grants annually to the promotion of high-quality STEM education and the release of a 5-year STEM strategic plan to coordinate resources and programming across the federal government to improve STEM education.\n\n\u201cThanks to Ivanka\u2019s leadership of the office of economic initiatives millions of opportunities have been created for America\u2019s workers both by legislative and administration action including Perkins CTE, tax reform, the National Council for the American Worker and the 6.5 million opportunities for career enhancement, continuing education, and on-the-job training pledged by 200 companies the private sector for American students and workers,\u201d the official said in a statement.\n\nIvanka Trump can certainly be congratulated for getting so many companies to put their names in writing and pledge to train workers. Yet these are not new jobs but training opportunities. Moreover, the numbers reflect pledges over a five-year period, not something already achieved, as the president framed it. Unlike many of the president\u2019s statements, there are at least real numbers attached, but his claim is still a real stretch.", "lang": "en"}
