During the 9:50 am broadcast on August 25, the channel aired footage of an area drowned in water to depict the calamitous situation in Pakistan\u2019s Karachi. This can be watched from 18:10 minutes into the show.\n\n\u201cAfter heavy rainfall in Pakistan\u2019s Karachi, a video of a shocking stunt by a man became viral. He can be seen jumping off a four-storied building in the video and he pulled off this stunt to showcase the failure of Imran Khan\u2019s government. The place where this incident took place experienced waist-deep flooding. The streets and lanes resembled a swimming pool hence the man jumped from a four-storied building into the water,\u201d narrated Ajwani.\n\nWhile visuals of a man diving into floodwater were played, a ticker on the screen read, \u201c\u092a\u093e\u0915\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928 \u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u0940 \u092a\u094b\u0932 \u0916\u0941\u0932\u0940\u201d which roughly translates to \u201cPakistan government exposed\u201d in English.\n\nThe same video was picked up by The Times of India on September 1 with the same claim that it\u2019s from Karachi.\n\nA day after the show was aired, Twitter user Shahnawaz Ansari took to the micro-blogging platform to inform that News18 India ran a three-day-old video of his brother\u2019s friend \u201cBhura Bhai\u201d from Indore as Pakistan.\n\nAlt News spoke with Ansari who connected us with Jafar, popularly known as \u201cBhura Bhai\u201d in his locality. \u201cThat\u2019s me in the video News18 aired as scenes from Pakistan. I had jumped into the water after we heard that a teenaged boy was drowning. But he was already rescued by the municipal corporation by the time I plunged into the water,\u201d said Jafar. He also sent us the original footage of the clip aired by News18.\n\nThe incident took place in Sikandrabad Colony and a mosque\u2019s minaret is visible in both clips\u2014the one aired by News18 (left) and the original sent by Jafar (right).\n\nJafar informed that the mosque is Sikandrabad Masjid located in the same colony. The Google Maps screenshot below shows that the mosque is barely 50 metres from Sikandrabad Colony.\n\nThe area floods almost every year during the monsoons as the Sirpur Lake, located about 5.5 km from the colony, overflows due to incessant rains. Jafar sent us another clip where he is diving into the water from a different building. He jumped a second time to show that the location is the same.\n\nNews18 India, therefore, picked up a video from Madhya Pradesh and aired it claiming a man dived into floodwaters in Pakistan\u2019s Karachi to send a message to PM Imran Khan for his \u2018failure\u2019 to tackle flooding in the country. The man had jumped into the water in Indore\u2019s Sikandrabad Colony to save a drowning boy.\n\n[Update: On September 2, four days after this fact-check was published, The Times of India also carried the video claiming it\u2019s from Pakistan.]", "lang": "en"}
