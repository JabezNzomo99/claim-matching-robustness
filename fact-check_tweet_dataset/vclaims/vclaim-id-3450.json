Respect and Salute To Indian Army. Feel Proud To Share This Picture.\"\n\nDespite numerous replies pointing out that the image was not from India, Kher has still not deleted her tweet.\n\nActress Shraddha Kapoor also shared the same photo with a message saying, \u201cThey freeze to make sure that we are warm. They protect to make sure that we feel safe. Can never thank you Jawaans enough.\u201d\n\nRight-wing troll Sonam Mahajan wasn't far behind in tweeting the image while also taking a dig at students of JNU.\n\nSadly, Syed Ata Hasnain a retired lieutenant general in the Indian Army also fell for the photo and shared it.\n\nWhile BOOM was unable to trace where exactly the photo originated we came across overwhelming evidence to suggest it has existed since 2012 on the Internet and has been used in the context of the Russian and Ukrainian conflict. Earlier in 2014 the website stopfake.org. debunked the image when it went viral as Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nOne of the photos was traced to a Russian social media post going back to 2013.\n\nThe second photo can be seen in blog about the role propaganda. Below is a loose translation of the text from Russian.
