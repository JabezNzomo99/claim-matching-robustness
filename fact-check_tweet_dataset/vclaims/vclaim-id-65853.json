Celebrities often make headlines when they have run-ins with the law. Had DeGeneres faced a child sex trafficking charge, it would have been picked up by the media, yet none have reported on it.\n\nAdditionally, DeGeneres is a California resident, and California state law mandates that anyone convicted of sex trafficking must register as a sex offender. A search for her name on California\u2019s sex offender registry website turned up no matches. It also appears nowhere on the Department of Justice\u2019s national sex offender registry.\n\nThe accusation may be related to a baseless rumor shared on alternative news websites, like Our New Earth News, that DeGeneres is currently wearing an ankle monitor.

In March, social media users widely shared posts making such claims about television personality Oprah Winfrey, despite them originating in a QAnon conspiracy theory, according to the Washington Post.\n\nDeGeneres did not return a request for comment.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
