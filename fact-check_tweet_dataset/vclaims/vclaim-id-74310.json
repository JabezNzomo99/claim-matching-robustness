The post also shows an image of a young man who is misidentified as Gates.\n\nFor years, social media conspiracy theorists have been circulating false information about bogus family relationships between public figures. In light of Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s arrest in July for allegedly conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse minors, numerous theories have popped up about her familial ties. Most recently, social media posts have claimed Bill Gates is related to Maxwell.\n\nOn Aug. 4, an account associated with the QAnon conspiracy group posted an image on Facebook that falsely claimed to show Gates with a rabbi and included this inaccurate caption: \u201cBill Gates with Rabbi Schneerson the head of the Jewish extremist end times cult Chabad Lubavitch. Gate\u2019s mother is a Maxwell, related to the Israeli Mossad agents Robert Maxwell and his daughter Ghislaine, who used child trafficking to blackmail world leaders with Jeffrey Epstein. Do you get it?\u201d\n\nBut Gates is not in the photo, which originally accompanied a 2014 article that appeared in the Israeli newspaper The Jerusalem Post. The photo features Yosef I. Abramowitz, the author of the article, \u201cBetter Energy: The Rebbe\u2019s energy.\u201d The Post captioned the photo, \u201cThe author with the Lubavitcher Rebbe in 1992.\u201d Gates is not referenced anywhere in the article.\n\nIn addition to not being the young man pictured, Gates isn\u2019t Jewish.\n\nIn 2014, Gates was interviewed by Rolling Stone about religion, among other topics. When asked about his belief in God, Gates said he agreed with \u201cpeople like Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths\u201d and people \u201csought false explanations\u201d because they didn\u2019t understand the natural world. However, Gates also said that he and his wife, Melissa, have \u201craised our kids in a religious way; they\u2019ve gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in.\u201d\n\nIn addition to misrepresenting Gates\u2019 religion, the post claims without evidence that Gates\u2019 mother was related to Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s father.\n\nAlthough Gates\u2019 mother, Mary Gates, had the maiden name Maxwell, the Facebook post provides no connection between her and Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s family. Mary Gates\u2019 father, James Willard Maxwell Jr., was born and raised in Lincoln, Nebraska, and was a bank executive and civic leader in Seattle, Washington. His father, J. W. Maxwell, Sr., founded the National City Bank of Seattle.\n\nIn contrast, Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s father, Robert Maxwell, was born Jan Ludvik Hoch in Czechoslovakia. Robert Maxwell lost most of his Jewish family during the Holocaust, but he escaped to France and then the UK. He was a member of British Parliament in the 1960s and ran the Maxwell Communication Corporation, which included the Mirror Group Newspapers and the New York Daily News.\n\nWe tried to reach the account that posted the claims on Facebook regarding any ties between Gates and Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s family, but we received no response.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
