Yes, but there is a catch: A post that has gone viral gives secret tips about how to return worn Nike children's shoes and seems to be backed up by the shoe giant's own warranty policy but with a specific caveat -- the company says the shoes may be returned for a refund only if they \"develop a material or workmanship flaw\" and not just regular wear and tear by active children.\n\nThe claim went viral as a post (archived here) where it was published by Facebook on May 4, 2020, under the title \"Parent Tip Monday !!! PSA!\" It opened:\n\n\n\n\"Parent Tip Monday !!! PSA! Do you buy your kid Nikes? Do they DESTROY them?! Did you know Nike has a 2 year warranty? Date inside tongue of shoe is 05/2018. If I go to Nike website and fill out warranty paper and ship shoes back before that date they send a voucher to redeem at a Nike store. I have done this Four times and one voucher was for $51 and the second was $38 the third $33 & the fourth $26 Note: this is not a political post so please refrain\" Yes there was holes at the bottom/Top Of his shoes as well\n\nThis is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing:\n\nThis claim about the warranty policy from Nike, the world's largest footwear manufacturer, is partially true.\n\nMany happy shoppers responded to the message about the Nike return policy hack, which raked up an enormous 27,000 shares on Facebook within one day of posting.\n\nThe return hack was also posted here, and raked up 8,800 shares and also here, where it earned 15,000 shares.\n\nNike confirmed its return policy to LeadStories that is detailed on the corporate website, noting that for 30 days after purchase shoes can be returned \"for any reason.\"\n\nThe company's warranty does allow customers to return purchased shoes within two years -- if they \"develop a material or workmanship flaw.\" It does not specifically say \"children's shoes.\"\n\nAccording to the Facebook post, the shoes can be returned before two years of purchase based on the date on the inside of the tongue of the shoe.\n\nBut the Nike warranty qualifies that, saying if its item has \"developed a flaw\" within two years after purchase it can be returned. The company famous for its slogan \"Just Do It\" explains its broader 30-day return policy:\n\nIf you believe your item is flawed, and it's within 30 days of your purchase, you may simply return it to us for a full refund. Remember, you may return Nike purchases for any reason, worn or not, for up to 30 days. For Nike.com purchases, please see \"How do I return my Nike.com order?\" for your return options (and if you want to try to exchange the item, you'll need to give us a call). For Nike store purchases, you'll want to take your item back to the store you bought it from.\n\n\n\nThe link provided on the Facebook page is the same one Nike links to on their corporate website for returns https://www.nike.com/help/claims/terms.\n\n\n\nMany commenters noted on the Facebook page that they have been returning worn shoes for years.\n\nHere is a YouTube video describing Nike's \"fairly generous return policy\" that was posted in 2017.\n\nThe Facebook post claims they received vouchers for decreasing amounts when they sent the shoes back.\n\nThe Nike website does not specify an amount that will be refunded but notes it will be the same as the purchase price.", "lang": "en"}
