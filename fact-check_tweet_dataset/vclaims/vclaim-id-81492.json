The video has been viewed more than 20,000 times.\n\nThe video has also gone viral on Facebook with many including Trehan appreciating the strict action taken against the lady.\n\nSeveral Facebook users drawing attention to the quick action taken by Bali officials, even drew parallels with Tanvi Seth, the lady from Uttar Pradesh who alleged harassment against a passport officer since she had married a Muslim and wanted to retain her maiden name. The Ministry of External Affairs under Sushma Swaraj had taken action against the officer after investigation revealed that he had overstepped his brief. Trehan's post on Facebook has got more than 30,000 views and has been shared over 640 times.\n\nFACT: The woman identified as Auj-e Taqaddas is in fact a British national of Pakistani origin.\n\nInternational media reports including BBC Indonesia reported that Taqaddas is a \u201cLahore born British national.\u201d Indonesia\u2019s largest news agency Antara News also reported her as being a \u201cPakistani national\u201d. The Mirror.co.uk and Russian website Sputnik also call her a \u201cPakistani origian British national.\u201d Taqaddas also holds a British passport as can be seen in many photos from the incident. The passport also mentions place of birth as Lahore.\n\nAccording to reports, Taqaddas has not been arrested but is detained by the immigration officials. Reports published in local Indonesian news websites state that Taqaddas appeared in Denpasar District court for her trial for slapping the officer but the trial was postponed to August 8. Till the trial is held, Taqaddas cannot be sentenced.\n\nAdditionally, Taqaddas who is a physicist and radiographer has published several papers available on Research Gate, a networking site for scientists and researchers. BOOM accessed one of them which mentions her bio as a \u201cBritish-Pakistani\u201d who has also completed her Bachelors of Science from Pakistan.\n\nOn July 28, Taqaddas, headed to Singapore was detained by immigration officials who noticed that she had overstayed her visa by 160 days. Taqaddas\u2019s visa had expired on February 18 this year, causing the Immigration officers to detain her despite having a boarding pass. To not incovenience other passengers, Taqaddas was allegedly taken to a room by the immigration officials and asked to appear in the immigration office in Jimbaran on Monday, July 30 for further investigation. BBC Indonesia reported that this angered an already upset Taqaddas as it would mean she would miss her flight apart from paying a hefty fine.\n\nThe video shows an angry and abusive Taqaddas shouting at an immigration official who local media reports have identified as 28-year-old Ardyansyah. Taqaddas can be heard blaming the immigration officer for missing her flight. Taqqadas tried to snatch her passport from the officer but when he resisted, she slapped him on the face. She then lashed out at the officer filming the whole incident to put the camera away or show his \"ugly face\".", "lang": "en"}
