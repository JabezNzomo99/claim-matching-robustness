Ralph Northam on a proposed abortion bill that aims to address nonviable pregnancies and severe fetal abnormalities. Northam, a pediatric neurologist, supports the bill, but the meme falsely implies he condones infanticide.\n\nA Facebook post twists Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s words regarding a controversial abortion bill drafted in Virginia last year. The meme, which has been circulating on social media, fabricates a quote from Northam and lacks context.\n\nThe meme shows an image of Northam, a Democrat and pediatric neurologist, with the label, \u201cThe governor of Virginia! A baby killer.\u201d The meme includes an alleged quote from Northam, which reads, \u201cThe infant Would be Delivered, kept Comfortable Then terminated.\u201d Behind Northam, a woman cradles her head in her hand. The meme, posted on Jan. 29, has been shared more than 3,000 times.\n\nIn a radio interview on Jan. 30, 2019, Northam was questioned on his views regarding the bill. The governor was interviewed after comments made by Virginia Delegate Kathy Tran, the bill\u2019s sponsor, went viral online. Northam was asked to respond to Tran and the bill on Virginia radio station WTOP\u2018s Ask The Governor segment.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about third trimester abortions \u2026 it\u2019s done in cases where there may be severe deformities, there may be a fetus that is non-viable,\u201d Northam said. \u201cIf a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that\u2019s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.\u201d\n\nThe new legislation, Virginia House Bill 2491, among other changes, would permit an abortion or termination of pregnancy after the second trimester in cases where it is determined by a physician that \u201cthe continuation of the pregnancy is likely to result in the death of the woman or impair the mental or physical health of the woman.\u201d\n\nCurrent Virginia law requires that three doctors must certify that the mother\u2019s physical and mental health is \u201csubstantially and irremediably\u201d impaired to permit a third trimester abortion. The new bill would require certification by one doctor.\n\nShortly after this interview, several prominent Republicans, including President Donald Trump, decried Northam\u2019s comments and accused him of condoning infanticide. A spokesman for Northam said that his comments in the WTOP interview were \u201cfocused on the tragic and extremely rare case in which a woman with a nonviable pregnancy or severe fetal abnormalities went into labor,\u201d and that Northam was \u201cabsolutely not\u201d referring to infanticide.\n\nAs we\u2019ve written, the president has repeatedly distorted Northam\u2019s comments, as well as facts regarding Virginia\u2019s abortion law.
