So we suffered also casualties in that year. Through the researches coming from some Filipinos, there are (sic) about 50,000 to 75,000 Filipinos [who] died at that time. Of course, they were also implementing some lockdowns.\u2026\u201d\n\n Source: RTVMalacanang, Kumusta Po Mahal Kong Kababayan? | Meeting on COVID-19 Concerns and Talk to the People on COVID-19, June 22, 2020, watch from 56:19 to 57:28\n\nContrary to Cimatu\u2019s claim, the Philippines became a commonwealth of the U.S. only on Nov. 15, 1935 -- more than a decade after the Spanish flu pandemic -- which lasted for 11 years until the American government \u201crecognized\u201d its independence in July 1946.\n\nPrior to the inauguration of the \u201cCommonwealth of the Philippines\u201d in 1935, Filipinos had been resisting the colonial rule of the Americans. Spain, the first colonizer, ruled the Philippines for more than 330 years before ceding it to the U.S. for $20 million under the Treaty of Paris.\n\nThe status of being a commonwealth, acting as a \"state\u201d of the U.S., was the \u201cpenultimate step\u201d toward the independence of the Philippines. Through the legislation and approval of the Philippine Independence Act, also known as Tydings-McDuffie law, in the U.S. in 1934, the country was assured of independence after a \"10-year transitional period,\" according to historical records published by the Official Gazette.\n\nThe Commonwealth of the Philippines officially ended on July 4, 1946, when Manuel Roxas took his oath as the newly elected president of the newly established Third Republic of the Philippines.\n\nThe Spanish flu pandemic, which later became known as the 1918 influenza, lasted until 1919, infecting at least 500 million people worldwide. Its death toll ranges from 40 million to 50 million, according to the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, respectively.\n\nIn the Philippines, an estimated 85,000 people died due to the pandemic in 1918, according to the annual report of the Philippine Health Service that year and published later in 1919. The Public Health Service under Vicente De Jesus, the first Filipino appointed as acting director of the American-led public office in 1919, noted in the report that \u201cit was impossible to keep tab of the actual number of cases, but it is believed that the general mortality was about 1.8 percent.\u201d\n\nWhile the 1918 pandemic was named after Spain, there is \u201cno universal consensus\u201d where it originated, based on an explainer by the U.S. CDC. However, several experts have argued that the virus could have come from China, U.S., France, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe virus that caused Spanish flu was the Influenza A (H1N1), the same lineage of contagion that caused the swine flu pandemic in 2009.\n\nCimatu is not the only official who has recently made inaccurate claims about the Spanish flu pandemic in light of the COVID-19 situation. In a speech in late May, President Duterte wrongly claimed the 1918 outbreak began prior to the First World War.
