Despite what Katie Hopkins tweeted it is not true. A huge warehouse fire in nearby Koekelberg was initially reported as being in Molenbeek but Koekelberg is not known as the \"Jihadi Capital of Europe\". There were some reports of an explosion but it was caused by the fire, not the other way round.\n\nOn May 15, 2018, right-wing columnist Katie Hopkins sent out a tweet with an embedded video (archived here):\n\nThe video was originally posted by Twitter user Dimitri Strobbe (archived here and here):\n\nThe tweet was part of a longer series reporting about the fire. Here is the first tweet (archived here):\n\nTranslation: \"Big fire in #molenbeek. Police and fire brigade on the scene\".\n\nBut local media reports pointed out the fire was in a municipal warehouse located in the Rue Stepman in Koekelberg that was used to store wood and plastic.\n\nThe area in red is part of Molenbeek. Molenbeek and Koekelberg are very close to each other, hence probably the confusion.\n\nNo media reported about an explosion being the cause of the fire and no connection to terrorism, jihad or the beginning of Ramadan has been found.", "lang": "en"}
