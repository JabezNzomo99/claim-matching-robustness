She said the prior month\u2019s rate, for December 2013, fell as low as 5 percent before increasing to 5.3 percent in January 2014.\n\n\"Our rate couldn\u2019t go lower,\" Sharief said.\n\nSharief said her source was from the county\u2019s public relations office, and when we asked a spokeswoman, Kimberly Maroe, she located it -- a news release from February 2014 that used the 5 percent statistic from December 2013, which was the most recent data at the time.\n\nThe news release said, \"Overall Broward excelled in many areas such as low unemployment, where at 5 percent, has remained the lowest unemployment rate among large urban counties in Florida for more than a year.\"\n\nBut that\u2019s not exactly what Sharief said at the Broward Workshop event. She said, \"the lowest in Florida,\" not \"the lowest in Florida among large urban counties.\"\n\nDoes it make a difference? Our research suggests that it does.\n\nFirst, we looked to see whether Broward did indeed have the lowest unemployment rate in Florida among \"large urban counties.\"\n\nThis requires a bit of guessing, because the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official federal tabulator of unemployment data, doesn\u2019t have a definition for \"large, urban counties.\"\n\nBut we were able to assemble a list by seeing which counties in the state ranked both in the 10 largest counties by population and the 10 most densely populated counties. Nine counties fit both requirements: Broward, Duval, Hillsborough, Lee, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, Pinellas and Seminole.\n\nWhen we looked at the most recent county-level unemployment rates available from BLS, which are from December 2013, we found that Broward did indeed have the lowest among that group. So if Sharief had communicated the talking point correctly during her remarks in Davie, she would have been correct.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t, so we next looked at whether Broward\u2019s rate was \"the lowest in Florida.\"\n\nIt turns out that among all of Florida\u2019s 67 counties, Broward does pretty well in this regard -- it ranks eighth-lowest statewide -- but this doesn\u2019t make Broward\u2019s rate \"the lowest in Florida.\" Here\u2019s the list of Florida\u2019s eight lowest county-wide unemployment rates for December 2013. All of the counties ranking better than Broward, with the exception of Monroe, are in the northern part of the state:\n\nBroward\u2019s rate also isn\u2019t Florida\u2019s lowest unemployment rate for a metropolitan area, a category that BLS does track.\n\nFor , the for this statistic, the 5.3 percent unemployment rate for Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach-Deerfield Beach was lower than for other large metro areas, such as Miami-Miami Beach-Kendall (6.9 percent), Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater (6.5 percent), West Palm Beach-Boca Raton-Boynton Beach (6.3 percent), Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford (6.0 percent) and Jacksonville (6.0 percent).\n\nBut two smaller metro areas had an unemployment rate lower than metro Fort Lauderdale -- Crestview-Fort Walton Beach-Destin (5.0 percent) and Gainesville (5.1 percent).\n\nWe\u2019ll note that some experts urge against reading too much into one month\u2019s worth of statistics.\n\n\"My strong instinct is to be skeptical of county-level data based on a single-month estimate of anything, including the unemployment rate,\" said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution. \"My hunch is that there\u2019s a lot of \u2018noise,\u2019 and that the amount of \u2018signal\u2019 might be questionable.\"\n\nWe also wondered whether there is any reason why Broward might be doing relatively well, employment-wise.\n\nSharief gave some credit to Broward\u2019s ordinance that encourages contractors to use local workers -- a policy implemented many years ago, but which she said is now paying off. She also said an airport expansion has helped. During Sharief\u2019s speech, Broward County Commissioner Stacy Ritter gave a shout-out on to certain construction projects that she said were creating jobs.\n\nMark Vitner, managing director and senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities, agreed that Fort Lauderdale\u2019s recovery \"has gained considerable momentum over the past year, as hiring in business and professional services has picked up.\"\n\nBut at least some of the airport and construction in question jobs are temporary jobs. And more troublesome to independent experts is that Broward\u2019s relatively good unemployment rate obscures other longer-term employment indicators that aren\u2019t so rosy.\n\nChris Lafakis, a Moody\u2019s senior economist who tracks Florida, said that among the six largest metropolitan areas and divisions in Florida, Fort Lauderdale has been \"dead last in payroll employment growth since December 2007, which is the month the recession began.\" The reason for this seemingly paradoxical situation -- a low unemployment rate despite weak employment growth -- stems from relatively slow growth in the size of the metro area\u2019s labor force, Lafakis said.\n\n\"It\u2019s true that projects like airport expansion are helping Broward\u2019s economy, but the low unemployment rate is overstating strength in Broward County\u2019s labor market,\" Lafakis said.\n\nSharief said Broward\u2019s unemployment rate of 5.3 percent is \"the lowest in Florida.\"\n\nThe rate -- which is indeed 5.3 percent -- is the lowest in Florida among large urban counties. But it\u2019s not the lowest in Florida. Seven counties and two smaller metropolitan areas have lower unemployment rates in the most recent data. Because she phrased her otherwise accurate talking point inaccurately in her speech, in a way that makes the county seem to be No. 1 when it's not, we rate the claim Mostly False.", "lang": "en"}
