Second, he said, Trump was angry at Iran for refusing U.S. coronavirus humanitarian aid. Third, he said Trump is trying to boost oil prices by threatening possible military action in the Middle East.\n\nThe last sentence in the Sputnik report implies that Washington has been hiding military casualties suffered in the January Iranian missile strike in Iraq, which was in retaliation for the U.S. airstrike that killed Qassem Soleimani, commander of the elite Quds Force of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\n\"On the night of January 8, Iran launched a missile strike on the American military infrastructure in Iraq. The number of victims of this attack was not disclosed.\"\n\nThe sentence echoes a previously debunked Iranian claim that the missile strike killed 80 U.S. troops.\n\nThe U.S. initially reported no casualties, but later announced 11 troops had been treated for concussion symptoms after the attack, and the number of those suffering traumatic brain injuries eventually grew to 111.\n\nAlong with American troops, the bases targeted by Iran housed military personnel from at least seven other nations participating in the coalition to defeat ISIS. These included Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Lithuania, Norway and Poland. None reported casualties.\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s \u201cshoot and destroy\u201d tweet, Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami, commander of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, issued his own rejoinder that any actions threatening Iran forces \u201cwill be met with an immediate and decisive response.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials say Iran has escalated harassment of U.S. naval vessels patrolling the Persian Gulf oil shipping lanes.\n\nAccording to an April 15 U.S. Navy Central Command press release, \u201c11 Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy (IRGCN) vessels repeatedly conducted dangerous and harassing approaches\u201d while six U.S. vessels were \u201cconducting joint integration operations with U.S. Army AH-64E Apache attack helicopters in the international waters of the North Arabian Gulf.\u201d\n\nThe Iranian navy has been videoing these interactions, and the videos have been broadcast on Iran\u2019s official channels.\n\nSome U.S. and EU analysts agreed with Ibragimov that Trump was calculating the impact that such a move would have on oil prices.\n\nStill, the views of this Kremlin-linked expert echo Tehran\u2019s, and similar opinions have been pushed extensively by regime-controlled Iranian media.\n\nIran\u2019s disinformation campaign in the wake of Soleimani\u2019s killing on Jan. 3 featured some unusual claims, including that the CIA\u2019s Iran chief died in a plane crash in Afghanistan.\n\nIran initially denied the Jan. 8 shoot down of a Ukrainian passenger airliner departing Tehran. Leaders later admitted that its air defenses mistook the airliner for a U.S. military jet. All 178 people on board died.", "lang": "en"}
