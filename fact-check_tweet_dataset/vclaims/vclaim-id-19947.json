Corporation tax rates have gone down since 2010, and they're a lot lower than they were in the 1980s.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-19947", "url": "https://fullfact.org/economy/corporation-tax-rates-and-revenues/", "vclaim": "Corporation tax: could we have raised more?\n\n\u201cOne of the major areas he [Jeremy Corbyn] is looking at raising tax is corporation tax. Now corporation tax has come down over the years in rate terms, in terms of the actual rate, and as it\u2019s come down what\u2019s happened is the amount collected has gone up. It\u2019s now \u00a356 billion, the highest level ever.\u201d \u201cUnder Margaret Thatcher corporation tax in this country was 52% and the lowest she ever got it to in the last years of her reign as Prime Minister was 34%. This government in 2010 has taken it from 28% to 19% and says that it will go down to 17%. Our proposal is to take it back up to 26%, half of where it was under Margaret Thatcher and still 2 points lower than it was in 2010 when this government came into office.\n\nLabour has committed to raising the main rate of corporation tax to 26% if they win the election. At the moment it is at 19% and it's set to fall to 17% in April 2020.\n\nIt\u2019s correct that the rate of corporation tax has fallen since 2010. In 2010 the standard rate of corporation tax was set at 28%. This was reduced by the Coalition and Conservative governments several times, ending up at 19% in April 2017. Its 2017 election manifesto promises to reduce corporation tax to 17% by 2020, in line with recent plans.\n\nRates are only half the picture when it comes to how much we pay in tax. Cuts to corporation tax rates have been partly offset by measures to lower capital allowances or to reduce tax avoidance.\n\nIt\u2019s also correct that corporation tax revenues have increased since 2010, although Mr Davis got the figure wrong. Last year in 2016/17 the UK government raised \u00a350 billion from corporation tax, a cash increase of about \u00a35 billion compared to the same time the year before.\n\nThe amount collected by the government hasn\u2019t risen simply because the rate has fallen. Successive policy costings done under the Coalition and Conservative governments suggest it would have collected more in corporation tax if it hadn\u2019t lowered the rates (even though such estimates are quite uncertain). You\u2019d expect the cash value of corporation tax receipts to rise each year as the economy grew, all else being equal.\n\nAs Mr Davis said, the cash value now is the highest recorded since 1980.\n\nIt\u2019s more useful to look at what has happened to this amount as a percentage of the UK\u2019s overall economic output. Initially, as a share of our GDP, the revenue from all forms of corporation tax (including things like Bank Surcharge, which aren\u2019t included in the \u00a350 billion figure above) increased from 2009/10 to 2011/12. It then fell for two years and levelled out for two more. Last year the share started to increase again.\n\nWhen Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979 the standard rate of corporation tax was set at 52%. It was reduced over the next few years and the last time it was changed while she was Prime Minister was in 1990 when it was cut to 34%.\n\nThe small companies rate of corporation tax also fell while Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister.", "lang": "en"}
