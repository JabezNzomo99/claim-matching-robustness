Gates has spoken of the need for \u201cdigital certificates\u201d for vaccination and testing but there is no evidence he has been in favor of a visible mark, like a tattoo. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation also said the claim is false.\n\n\u201cBill Gates wants \u2018digital tattoos\u2019 to check who has been tested,\u201d a May 4, 2020 Facebook post says. \u201cYou mean a tattoo like holocaust victims have, Mr Gates?\u201d it adds.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s called the mark of the beast,\u201d one Facebook user wrote in the comments, in apparent reference to biblical text.\n\n\u201cDoes he not have the comprehension to know that would be exactly what they did to the Jews?\u201d another wrote.\n\nAFP found no evidence, as of May 12, 2020, of Gates, the Microsoft billionaire, publicly supporting a tracking method comparable to a mandatory physical mark, visible to the naked eye.\n\nThe claim may stem from from this study published in December 2019. It was conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and partially funded by the Gates Foundation. The study says MIT researchers have developed a way to store medical information under the skin, using \u201ca quantum dot dye,\u201d a technique that could be particularly beneficial in developing countries that lack medical records infrastructure. The dye, delivered by a microneedle patch at the same time as the vaccine, remains invisible to the naked eye, the study explains.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to create something very simple (...) also that was more private in a sense that it didn\u2019t really link somebody\u2019s name with medical history anywhere,\u201d Dr Ana Jaklenec, a MIT research scientist, told AFP in a phone call. \u201cIt\u2019s invisible, there is really no way to track it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe claim in the post, however, compares the \u201cdigital tattoo\u201d to the one \u201cholocaust victims have,\u201d in reference to the marks used by Nazi Germany, when SS authorities started tattooing the bodies of inmates with a camp serial number. The tattoos were ink-based, and first printed across the chest of inmates, then later on their left forearm.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Gates has made references to potential solutions for keeping track of coronavirus testing and vaccinations, including through digital certificates, like in this Q&A he hosted on Reddit in April.\n\nThe tech titan has been a leading voice on the push for a vaccine to combat COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, pledging $50 million as part of broader funding that has made him a target of anti-vaccine campaigners.\n\nAsked by AFP about the Facebook post regarding digital tattoos, a spokesperson for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation said in an email: \u201cThis claim is false. \u201d\n\nMultiple conspiracy theories concerning Gates and the novel coronavirus have emerged, the latest being a manipulated photo debunked by AFP USA. Posts about a letter said to have been written by the billionaire were debunked by AFP fact checkers in Hong Kong, and warnings about a \u201cBill Gates vaccine,\u201d were proven by AFP Ethiopia to be false, given there is no such treatment.\n\nThe novel coronavirus pandemic has killed some 284,000 people worldwide, since it emerged in China in late 2019.", "lang": "en"}
