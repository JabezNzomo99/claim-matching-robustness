However, there is no record of Raoult making such a statement and his office flatly rejected the claim. Scientists believe the virus emerged from a natural source.\n\n\u201cDidier Raoult reveals that the Covid-19 was created by the United States and China, at the end of causing more than 30 million of the dead in Africa (sic),\u201d reads a Facebook post shared more than 19,000 times since it was published on May 12, 2020.\n\nThe post claims the French scientist said that the US and China \u201chave created powerful laboratories\u201d alongside billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates \u201cwith the aim of destroying Africa\u201d.\n\nA similar post circulating in French was shared more than 165,000 times before it was deleted. AFP Fact Check has archived it here.\n\nDidier Raoult has hailed malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 patients, but a number of recent studies have found the drug \u2013 which can also have adverse side effects \u2013 ineffective in treating the disease.\n\nUS President Donald Trump is a vocal champion of the drug and made the surprise announcement on May 18 that he had been taking it for about a week.\n\nContacted by AFP Fact Check, Raoult\u2019s specialised infectious diseases hospital in Marseille rejected the comments attributed to him in the Facebook post.\n\nThe scientist \u201chas never taken any stand on this subject,\u201d the Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire de Marseille told AFP Fact Check by phone.\n\nIn February, The Lancet medical journal published a statement signed by dozens of scientists around the world which condemned \u201cconspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin\u201d. It pointed to numerous studies that \u201coverwhelmingly conclude\u201d the disease originated in wildlife.\n\nScientists believe the new coronavirus originated in bats before passing to humans in China's rapidly urbanising Hubei province, probably via a third species.\n\nContacted by AFP Fact Check last month, Etienne Simon-Lori\u00e8re, virologist at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, said it would be \u201cinfinitely too complex\u201d for a scientist to create a virus.\n\n\u201cEven if the most brilliant scientist wanted to create a virus, it would be infinitely too complex because you\u2019d have to create something entirely new,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat you could try to do is create something from the elements of a pre-existing virus, like SARS-CoV-1, for example. But in that case, you would find signs in the RNA (ribonucleic acid, genetic code similar to DNA) sequence that would correspond to parts of the genome of the pre-existing virus\u201d, which is not the case with COVID-19, he said.\n\nMarie-Paule Kieny, head of research at France\u2019s Inserm public health research organisation, rejected claims the virus came from a \u201claboratory manipulation\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe RNA sequence of SARS-2 CoV (the new coronavirus, editor\u2019s note) shows that the sequence of a bat coronavirus found in China, RaTG13, is the closest parent to SARS-2, particularly strains that have previously circulated in Wuhan,\u201d she told AFP Fact Check last month.\n\nAFP Fact Check has previously debunked claims that Chinese spies stole the virus from a laboratory in Canada and that 5G networks caused the outbreak.", "lang": "en"}
