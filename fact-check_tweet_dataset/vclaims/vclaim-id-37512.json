This claim is being widely circulated by Facebook pages such as Nation with NaMo, PMO India: Report Card and Shankh Naad. Rahul Gandhi recently concluded his two-day maiden visit to the UAE.\n\nIndia Today Fact Check found this claim to be misleading. During his interaction with the Indian diaspora in Dubai, Rahul Gandhi did not credit Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s idea of non-violence just to Islam but other religions such as Christianity and Judaism too. These posts have been shared more than 11,000 times at the time of the last count.\n\nIn the nine-second video, Rahul can be heard saying, Mahatma Gandhi picked up the idea of non-violence from ancient Indian philosophy, from Islam.\" The remaining part of the speech was mischievously cropped in the viral video.\n\nRahul Gandhi's full speech is available on the Congress' Facebook page. In the original video, which is 27 minutes and 37 seconds long, Rahul Gandhi can be heard saying, Non-violence is embedded inside our DNA and it has been embedded not for 50 years. Mahatma Gandhi was a great exponent of non-violence. But Mahatma Gandhi ji picked up the idea of non-violence from our great religions, from ancient Indian philosophy from Islam, from Christianity, from Judaism, from every great religion where it is clearly written that violence will not help anyone achieve anything.\"\n\nThe same has also been tweeted by the Congress.\n\nHence, we can conclude that Rahul Gandhi\u2019s video was mischievously edited just to mislead users and give them an incomplete perspective.\n\nIn the past too, Rahul was targeted in a similar manner. In November 2018, a video of Rahul Gandhi went viral where he was attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi. However, the viral video misled netizens by not presenting the complete story as it was cropped too. India Today had successfully debunked the claim.\n\nAlso Read | Fact Check: No, Rahul Gandhi didn\u2019t say he will make Sun rise from the West\n\nAlso Read | Fact Check: Did Rahul Gandhi go blank on a question about Kailash Mansarovar?", "lang": "en"}
