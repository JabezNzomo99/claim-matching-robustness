This is false; the photo was taken during the Eid al-Fitr holiday in August 2019, months before the novel coronavirus pandemic, and mosques in Calgary are closed.\n\n\u201cCheck out the social distancing from Calgary Muslims during Ramadan,\u201d says a Facebook post from late April 2020. Below, a photo shows hundreds of men under a large tent.\n\nSeveral identical versions of the posts have been shared since April 25, shortly after the beginning of Ramadan, which started on April 23 this year.\n\nAccording to social media monitor CrowdTangle, one post, which has since been deleted, was shared in several large Canadian Facebook groups.\n\nHowever, the photo used to decry Calgary Muslims\u2019 alleged breach of social distancing during the pandemic was taken in August 2019, months before the novel coronavirus was first reported in China.\n\nDan McGarvey, a photographer for Canada\u2019s national broadcaster CBC, took the photo at a ceremony celebrating the start of Eid al-Fitr, another Muslim holiday, on August 11, 2019 at Calgary\u2019s Akram Jomaa Islamic Centre.\n\nImam Fayaz Tilly, a spokesman for the Muslim Council of Calgary, confirmed to AFP that the posts were false.\n\n\u201cI think most Calgarians know that this was deliberately shared to create confusion,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe immediately suspended prayers, Friday prayers and all congregations, even before government regulations. All of our programs are being streamed online to various social media platforms,\u201d Tilly told AFP.\n\nAsked if there had been any reports or complaints around issues of social distancing in connection to Ramadan celebrations, a Calgary Police Service spokesperson told AFP: \u201cTo date, we have not seen any reports to the Calgary Police Service or complaints about this.\u201d\n\nIn order to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, the city of Calgary declared a state of local emergency on March 15, and gatherings of more than fifteen people are prohibited throughout the province of Alberta, in which Calgary sits.\n\nAs a result, places of worship have closed their doors, including the Akram Jomaa Islamic, which is offering Facebook Live sermons and is delivering iftar, the meal breaking the daily Ramadan fast at sunset, to community members at home.\n\nOn April 30, 3,590 of Alberta\u2019s 5,355 confirmed COVID-19 cases were in the Calgary zone, including 57 of 89 deaths related to the virus in the province.\n\n\u200bAFP Fact Check has debunked more than 400 instances of false or misleading information about the novel coronavirus.
