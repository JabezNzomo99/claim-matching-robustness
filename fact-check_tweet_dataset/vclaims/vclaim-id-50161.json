It also warns that messages encouraging users to upgrade to \u201cWhatsapp Gold\u201d should be ignored. Finally it says people should not open a video called \u201cDance of the Pope\u201d as it is a \u201cvirus that formats your mobile.\u201d\n\nWhatsApp Gold scams are a real thing. You should not open any links for WhatsApp Gold services and report these messages to Action Fraud, the national cybercrime reporting centre.\n\nThe other video viruses mentioned in the post are not real, and variants of these hoaxes have been going viral for years.\n\nThe Martinelli hoax has been around since at least 2017, according to fact checking website Snopes. Back then it was also poised to come out \u201ctomorrow\u201d, yet no evidence of the video has ever come to light.\n\nCybersecurity firm Sophos has written that \u201cin theory, playing a deliberately booby-trapped video file on your mobile phone could end up in a malware infection\u201d but it is very rare.\n\nThe Dance of the Pope video hoax is even older, dating back to at least 2015 when it was also fact checked by Snopes. Again there is no evidence of it being a real thing. Similar claims also give the video a slightly different title, for example \u201cDance of the Dad\u201d warnings circulating in Quebec, and these are also nonsense.\n\nThe \u201cWhatsApp Gold\u201d scam, however, is real. A simple search of Twitter or Google will show various websites claiming to offer a download for an enhanced WhatsApp app. We\u2019re not linking to any of them for obvious reasons, and you should not click on them if you come across them. There is no such enhanced version of WhatsApp, whether called \u201cWhatsApp Gold\u201d or \u201cWhatsApp Plus\u201d (which other versions of the scam sometimes call it.)\n\nIn general, don\u2019t open message attachments from unknown sources. Sophos recommends you only get your mobile apps from official sources like the Apple App Store or Google Play, that you apply security updates on your devices promptly and that you use security software on your device.", "lang": "en"}
