More Britons are in work now than at any time since records began. In the first three months of this year about 32 million people over the age of 16 were in work.\n\nSimilarly the employment rate was also at its highest\u2014around 76% of UK adults aged 16 to 64 were employed (or around 31 million).\n\nJust before the referendum (from April-June 2016), the employment rate for people aged 16 to 64 was about 74%.\n\nThe employment rate has also increased among people aged 16 to 64 born overseas (both from other EU countries and the rest of the world). It was 72% before the referendum and was almost 74% at the start of this year. The proportions are the same when looking at people with citizenship of other EU countries and the rest of the world.\n\nThe total number of over 16 year olds born outside the UK in work has increased by around 390,000 from January-March 2016 to January-March 2018.\n\nThese figures on employment by country of birth aren\u2019t adjusted to take account of the fact that employment generally rises and falls at different times of the year, so the ONS say it is best practice to compare the same time of the year. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve compared the numbers from January-March 2016, rather than from April-June 2016, directly before the referendum\n\nIncreased employment contrasts with some predictions that a vote for leave in the EU referendum would increase unemployment. Before the referendum, the then-Chancellor George Osborne said that \u201cacross Britain as many as 820,000 jobs could be lost.\u201d He was quoting Treasury analysis which said that the number of unemployed people would increase by that number in the two years following a vote to leave.\n\nThat\u2019s not the same as the number of jobs as one person can have more than one job.\n\nThe Treasury analysis estimated that under different scenarios following a vote to leave between 520,000 (in a \u201cshock scenario\u201d) and 820,000 (in a \u201csevere shock scenario\u201d) more people would be unemployed by June 2018.\n\nThe number of unemployed people over 16 and actively seeking work in the last four weeks has decreased by around 216,000 since April-June 2016.\n\nThat means about 4% of over 16s, who are seeking and able to work, were unemployed in the first three months of the year, down from 5% before the referendum. That\u2019s the joint lowest rate since 1975.", "lang": "en"}
