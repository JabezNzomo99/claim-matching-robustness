Sweet died of natural causes in March at age 96.\n\n\n\nMisinformation has proliferated online since Jeffrey Epstein \u2014 a well-connected financier who was facing sex trafficking charges \u2014 hung himself in a Manhattan prison on Aug. 10.\n\nShortly after his death, a story began circulating online with a false headline that claims a judge overseeing a case involving Epstein was \u201ckilled.\u201d And other recently published stories suggest that the judge died this month, which isn\u2019t true either.\n\nU.S. District Judge Robert Sweet was 96 when he died in Ketchum, Idaho, on March 24.\n\nThe coroner for Blaine County, Idaho, where Ketchum is located, confirmed to us that the judge died of natural causes. There was no autopsy, coroner Russell Mikel said, explaining that an autopsy isn\u2019t necessary if the deceased was of \u201cadvanced age,\u201d had a known medical condition that would contribute to the death, or if there was no forensic reason.\n\nMany of the stories that have been posted in the last week reference a Politico article that reported his death back when it happened five months ago, but those recent stories fail to provide the correct time frame.\n\nInstead, they have headlines like this: \u201cJeffrey Epstein Judge Dies Suddenly.\u201d And the stories misleadingly say the death occurred \u201cSunday.\u201d\n\nAlthough the headline doesn\u2019t make it clear, Sweet wasn\u2019t presiding over the criminal sex-trafficking case that was pending against Epstein. Rather, he was handling a civil suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York that was brought by one of Epstein\u2019s accusers in 2015. That case was reassigned on July 9 to another judge, Loretta Preska, who complied with a mandate from an appellate court that some of the records in the case be unsealed.\n\nThe court docket shows the last thing Sweet did in the case was deny a motion from one of Epstein\u2019s co-defendants on Feb. 26.\n\nHe died about a month later while on vacation.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
