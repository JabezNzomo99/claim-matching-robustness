Recently, a controversy erupted at the university over the presence of a portrait of Mohammad Ali Jinnah. This had led to a tussle between the students and members of Hindu Yuva Vahini. Now, it has been alleged that AMU students raised a particular slogan, \u2018Bharat se lenge azaadi\u2019 (We will seize freedom from India- translated) as part of their protests. The tweet posted below is by @goonereol who is a contributor to OpIndia.\n\nThis claim is spreading rapidly on social media, particularly on Twitter where many social media users have slammed AMU and its students. It is also being cited by Pakistani nationals on Twitter.\n\nAlt News analysed the video and transcribed the sloganeering that took place at this event. In the video it can be heard that the protesters are chanting the following:\n\nIt can be heard clearly from 00:37 to 00:40 that the protesters are chanting \u2018Bharat meinlenge azaadi\u2019 (We will take freedom in India) and not \u2018Bharat se lenge azaadi\u2019 (We will take freedom from India). Immediately after, the next lines are \u2018jeene marne ki azaadi, khane khane ki azaadi (freedom to live and die, freedom of choice of food). To dispel any doubts about what was actually chanted, we took a small clip from the video starting from 00:35 to 00:42 and halved the speed of the audio and video. This can be watched below.\n\nEarlier in 2016 when the JNU controversy was at its peak, a video had been released in which it was alleged that JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar had raised secessionist slogans. It was later found that the video was doctored. The word \u2018azaadi\u2019 itself was construed as a call for separation when in fact these slogans were chanted as a call for freedom from oppression and injustice, real or perceived.\n\nUpdate: The person deleted his tweet after which we have added a screenshot.", "lang": "en"}
