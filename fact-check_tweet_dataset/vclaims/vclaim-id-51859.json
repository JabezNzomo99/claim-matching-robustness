The advisory claims that families of those killed while in isolation will not be able to hold funerals or burials for them. The claim is false; the Pakistan Red Crescent denied issuing such a statement, and Pakistan\u2019s health authority does allow funerals for those killed by the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe notice has been shared over 16,000 times since it was published here on Facebook on March 25, 2020.\n\nPart of the Urdu advisory translates to English as: \u201cImportant Announcement / If any of your child or member of the family tests positive for coronavirus, then they will be taken away by the staff of the health department. They will keep the patient in solitary and isolated from everyone. There will be no permission at all to meet the patient. Also you will not be able to take care of them.\n\n\u201cIf they get well, they will come back home, otherwise you will not be able to see them ever again. The health department will not allow you to hold a funeral and burial. You will only be informed that a member of your family has died and they will bury his body themselves. Please think.\u201d\n\nThe note carries the Pakistan Red Cresent logo, and credits the \u201cHealth Department (Government of Pakistan)\u201d as the source.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe purported advisory has also been shared on Facebook here, here, here, here and here.\n\nHowever, these claims are false.\n\nThe Pakistan Red Crescent Society took to Facebook on March 26 to refute the notice, saying the organisation has \u201cno link to such misinformation\u201d.\n\n\u201cA few posts wrongly attributed to the Pakistan Red Crescent Society are circulating on social media. It is clarified that the PRCS has no link with such misinformation, nor are these in line with our mandate. The case is being forwarded to FIA [Federal Investigation Agency] Cybercrime Wing for necessary legal action,\u201d the post reads.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the Pakistan Red Crescent\u2019s post:\n\nPakistan's health officials also have not barred families from holding funerals or burying relatives who have died of COVID-19.\n\nThe country\u2019s National Institute of Health has issued \u201csafe and dignified\u201d burial guidelines, which include wearing gloves and using disinfectants.\n\nCOVID-19 has killed at least 58 people and infected 4,075 others in Pakistan as of April 8, according to official government records.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the COVID-19 case toll on the Pakistan goverment website:", "lang": "en"}
