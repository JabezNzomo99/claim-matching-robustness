It aims to take a dig at the couple, who has been a strong critique of the Modi led government.\n\nBOOM contacted Akhtar on Tuesday, who denied having ever made such a statement.\n\nHe said, \"The statement is a total lie. I have told this time and again and I will tell this now, I have not made any such comments. I completely disown this statement. I am very active and vocal on Twitter and whatever I have to say, I say it through that medium.\"\n\n\"I would also point out that I am not on Facebook. If this is viral on my name on that particular social medium, then it is completely false.\"\n\nFurthermore, Akhtar added, \"Why would I leave India? There cannot be a reason strong enough for me to leave my country. It is my country. These kind of statements are completely fake, baseless and rubbish. They have been doing the rounds repeatedly and I don't see any reason why I have to clarify this. It is a disgrace\"\n\nBOOM then ran a Twitter advanced search and found that though Akhtar has been vocal about Modi and the BJP government, he has never made any statement about leaving the country.\n\nThe same fake quote was attributed to Azmi ahead of the elections results, following which she took to Twitter to rubbish it.\n\n\n\nIn fact Akhtar engaged in a war of words with netizens, who picked on Shabana Azmi following the tweet.\n\nAnother viral fake quote was attributed to Azmi in the past.
