Perhaps this is why intellectuals did not see this lynching.)\u201d \u2013 tweeted Pushpendra Kulshrestha (@Nationalist_Om).\n\nKulshrestha has been found circulating several cases of misinformation recently \u2013 video of a man offering Namaz on Malaysian road was falsely portrayed to be from India; a photo of a young girl from a 2017 BBC footage on Rohingyas was shared with a false and communal claim.\n\nSeveral other users have shared the same video tweeted by Kulshrestha.\n\nIt was also circulated by many on Facebook.\n\nThe video actually depicts a 2017 incident from Bangladesh. On April 1, 2017, assailants killed Abu Syed and seriously injured Md Ali. The two men were accused in the murder of Jubo League leader Monir Hossain Sarkar and were absconding. This incident occurred in Titas subdivision of Comilla district in Bangladesh and was also covered by local news website called Comilla-r-Kagoj which translates to \u2018Comilla\u2019s Newspaper\u2019 in English.\n\nAnother Bangladeshi news portal Jagonews24.comtalks about the incident in a March 2018 article about political murders in Titas. The report says that Sarkar was shot dead on November 8, 2016, in Gouripur Bazar. Six months later, his supporters sought revenge for the murder and hacked to death Abu Syed and Md Ali.\n\nAlt News contacted Bangladeshi journalists from Comilla district who corroborated the events and confirmed that the video pertains to the lynching of Md Ali and Abu Syed. The attack was sparked by internal conflicts between different factions of Jubo League, the youth wing of the ruling Awami League. Monir Hussain Sarkar was the then Ziarkandi Union Parishad chairman under Titas Upazila and Upazila Jubo League secretary. Md Ali and Abu Syed, who were killed for his murder, were also Jubo League members.\n\nA video of the incident was uploaded on YouTube on April 2, 2017. This shows the same scenes as in the video currently viral.\n\nAlt News has debunked this video several times in the past when it was viral as Hindu killed by Muslims in West Bengal and Bihar. In May 2017, it was also viral as Kashmiri students killing a CRPF jawan. Recently, several videos from around the world \u2013 Sri Lanka. Malaysia, Guatemala \u2013 were shared on Indian social media with a false and communal narrative.", "lang": "en"}
