But in addition to an unrealistic scenario, that number must be viewed in context over more than two decades, so \u201c$3 trillion\u201d amounts to a reduction of 6 percent. The study concludes coal usage would almost disappear, but innovation in clean energy sources would slow considerably, which also raises the cost of complying with the commitments.\n\nJohn Reilly, lead author of the report, said he \u201cdisagrees completely\u201d with Trump\u2019s characterization that the 0.2 degree cut is a \u201ctiny, tiny\u201d amount that is not worth pursuing. As a part of the deal, countries reexamine their commitments and can exceed or extend their pledges beyond 2030. The intent of the research was to say the Paris deal was a small step, and that more incremental steps need to be taken in the long run.\n\nTrump implies that the money was taken out of U.S. defense monies. But the U.S. contributions were paid out of the State Department\u2019s Economic Support Fund, one of the foreign assistance programs to promote economic or political stability based on U.S. strategic interests. Republican lawmakers have criticized the use of this fund, saying Congress designated the money to prioritize security, human rights and other efforts unrelated to climate change. However, the payments were made with congressional notification and meetings with congressional staff.\n\nEnvironmentalists have criticized many of Trump\u2019s projects, particularly for his plans to build a golf course on protected sand dunes and chopping down hundreds of trees for a golf course renovation. As a businessman, Trump or his property did win two environmental awards. In 2007, the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., received an award for \u201cenvironmental stewardship through golf course maintenance, construction, education and research.\u201d Three years later, the golf course was cited for a series of environmental violations.", "lang": "en"}
