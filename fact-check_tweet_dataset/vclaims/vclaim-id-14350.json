No one from the government of Qatar has had any role in this production,\u201d Phil Rees told leading US political website The Hill.\n\n\"The idea for the investigation came from Peter Charley, the reporter and producer, a 30-year veteran with Australian TV. Blaming the messenger rather than addressing the message is always an act of last resort by politicians.\u201d [2]\n\nAl Jazeera began broadcasting in 1996 when a group of former BBC reporters received backing from Qatar's monarch to start a TV network independent of Western channels. The broadcaster states on its website that it \u201cis an independent news organisation funded in part by the Qatari government\u201d. [3][4]\n\nLuciano Zaccara, assistant professor at Qatar University's Gulf Studies Centre says Al Jazeera has helped promote Qatar's influence in the region. \"It put Qatar on the map,\" he told GlobalPost in 2015. \"Al Jazeera was the most important tool (Qatari leaders) had to influence public opinion.\" [3]\n\nAl Jazeera has long been a source of tension between Qatar and its Arab neighbours, accused of being a mouthpiece for terrorists.\n\nIn 2006 the network aired an audio tape from Osama bin Laden and an address from bin Laden\u2019s top deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri. The statements were picked up by every major news agency and were vetted for authenticity by the CIA. US President George Bush and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld later accused Al Jazeera of fuelling anti-American sentiment and giving terrorists a podium.\n\nIn its defence Al-Jazeera said it assesses such tapes purely on the basis of news value. Editor-in-chief Ahmed al-Sheikh said Al-Jazeera\u2019s editors wrangle over what portions, if any, they can air. [5]\n\nIn 2011 Al Jazeera became the primary source of information for its coverage of the Arab spring, a series of pro-democracy uprisings that enveloped several largely Muslim countries, including Tunisia, Morocco, Syria, Libya, Egypt and Bahrain. Two years later Egyptian secret police arrested the network\u2019s Australian journalist Peter Greste and an Egyptian reporter on suspicion of illegally broadcasting news harming \"domestic security\". Egypt's military-installed government cracked down on Al-Jazeera following the 2013 overthrow of president Mohamed Morsi, accusing the broadcaster of bias in favour of Islamist group, the Muslim Brotherhood. [6]\n\nIn 2017 when Saudi Arabia cut ties with Qatar it accused Al Jazeera and Qatar of supporting militants and broadcasting their ideology. \"(Qatar) embraces multiple terrorist and sectarian groups aimed at disturbing stability in the region, including the Muslim Brotherhood, ISIS (Islamic State) and al-Qaeda, and promotes the message and schemes of these groups through their media constantly,\" the Saudi state news agency SPA said. [7]\n\nIn the same year after Saudi attempts to shut the network, Al Jazeera addressed accusations of supporting extremism in an open letter, claiming it challenged \u201call sides of the story\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe defend the freedom of expression and believe in people's right to knowledge. We take no sides. We are no one\u2019s messenger or spokesperson and we never have been,\u201d it said. [8]\n\nIn a 2017 article University of Southern California academic and author Philip Seib wrote there was \u201ctruth to the allegations that Al Jazeera Arabic\u2019s reporting has a pro-Islamist slant\u201d.\n\n\"Qatar\u2019s adversaries say this reporting takes the form of sympathetic coverage of not only the Muslim Brotherhood but also Al-Qaeda linked groups in Syria and Yemen.\" [9]\n\nIn 2017 author Hugh Marks wrote in The Observer that while Al Jazeera had raised political awareness across the Middle East, western audiences needed to consider the network had two faces - one Arabic and one English - and it was \u201cthe Arabic face that creates all the problems in Qatar\u2019s neighbourhood\u201d.\n\nMarks noted Arab regimes persecuting Qatar \u201care all vulnerable to being overthrown by popular revolution and replaced by Islamist groups, so seeing these same groups presented as legitimate political opposition on Al Jazeera and being allowed to agitate for political change represents a clear existential threat\u201d. [10]\n\nAAP FactCheck found there is no direct evidence to support One Nation\u2019s claim, however it\u2019s important to note that Al Jazeera is a broadcaster with channels in English and Arabic. There is some evidence of a pro-Islamist editorial stance by Al Jazeera Arabic and its Qatari owners.", "lang": "en"}
