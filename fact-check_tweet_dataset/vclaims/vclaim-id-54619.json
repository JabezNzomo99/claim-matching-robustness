No, that's not true. There is no medical evidence sodomy causes these types of injuries in children and an image of a child often used in social media posts making the claim comes from a documentary shot in Gaza during the 2014 war. The pattern of bruising around her eye sockets, referred to by some as \"panda eyes,\" were the result of war injuries, not sexual acts. There is no evidence to support the claim that such injuires are a real thing in \"pedophile circles.\"\n\nThe claim appeared in a post (archived here) published on Facebook on July 19, 2020. It opened:\n\nHere is an example of a similar post making the same claim:\n\nThis is the photo used in the first post:\n\nThe photographs showing the little girl with hematomas around her eyes, and showing her healed a year later, come from a clip of the video, \"Children of Gaza.\" The film was shot in Palestine by the documentary movie maker Jon Snow for the British broadcasting network Channel 4 and posted online in 2015.\n\nThe girl's name is Niema Habufu, which is revealed at 2:35 into the film. Snow makes it clear that the bruising is related to injuries she sustained in the bombings.\n\nAn often used screenshot claiming \"Panda Eyes\" is a term used by pedophiles appears to have originated on the website Urban Dictionary, as this tweet (archived here) seems to imply by including this screenshot:\n\nHowever at the time of writing that definition does not appear on Urban Dictionary, which is a crowdsourced dictionary website where users can enter definitions for any word or term they choose. The current entry has six definitions, two of which are sexual or violent in nature, but none of them reference pedophilia.\n\nAn older archived copy of the page shows more definitions but Lead Stories has been unable to locate an archived copy that contains the definition above.\n\nAaron Peckham, the founder and CEO of the site, wrote a blog post (archived here) on July 7, 2020 remarking the site had been increasingly used to post abusive content in recent years and promising to review procedures around removing such items. It is likely the definition in question was removed under these policies. We have reached out to Peckham for comment and will update this post when we hear back.\n\nAt the time of writing the the top definition of panda eyes on Urban Dictionary is from Aug. 8, 2011:\n\nPeer reviewed medical journals are in agreement that brain tumors and skull traumas are the main causes of swollen and discolored eye regions in children, and they do not mention sodomy as a possibility. A National Institutes of Health publication lays the blame for child eye-region bruising on head injuries:\n\nThe appearance of a child's eye area can be deceiving and, an NIH pediatric paper warns, \"Periorbital swelling may initially be misinterpreted as child abuse.\" Factors for physicians to consider include initial tumor staging, tumor biology and the child's age.\n\nForensic sexual assault examiner Kimberly A. Basinger, RN, told Lead Stories, \"I take care of child victims before court and I am called to testify in court. I have never seen this type of eye discoloration related to sodomy.\" Basinger, despite practising since 1996 and seeing close to 800 sexually abused children, had not heard the term \"panda eyes\" before speaking with Lead Stories. She adds:\n\nLead Stories has reached out to Children's Hospital of Colorado and the Kempe Center for Child Exploitation in Denver. So far, they have not replied.\n\nOther social media posts sometimes link the sexual interpretation of \"panda eyes\" to pop star Lady Gaga. Here is an example of such a post:\n\nBut the post provides no evidence (photographic or documented) that Lady Gaga is sending out signals or doing anything other than wearing circular black makeup. The performer is well known for dark, fanciful eye makeup designs, going as far as creating her own makeup brand \"Haus\" (archived here) to create effects.", "lang": "en"}
