As many as 46 deaths have been reported and a few hundreds are severely wounded.\n\nBOOM ran a reverse image search and found that the photograph is not from the riot ravaged North East Delhi but from Syrian capital, Damascus. The image was clicked on February 21, 2018 in the war torn region of Eastern Ghouta region on the outskirts of Damascus. The wounded boy was waiting to receive treatment at a make-shift hospital in Kafr Batna. The image was clicked by AFP photojournalist Amer Almohibany. The image can be found here in the stock images of Gettyimages. Below is a screenshot of the same. The image, uploaded to GettyImages, have been captioned as, \"A wounded Syrian boy covered in blood waits to receive treatment at a make-shift hospital in Kafr Batna in the besieged Eastern Ghouta region on the outskirts of the capital Damascus following Syrian government bombardments on February 21, 2018. Syrian jets carried out more deadly raids on Eastern Ghouta as Western powers and aid agencies voiced alarm over the mounting death toll and spiralling humanitarian catastrophe. / AFP PHOTO / Amer ALMOHIBANY (Photo credit should read AMER ALMOHIBANY/AFP via Getty Images).\"", "lang": "en"}
