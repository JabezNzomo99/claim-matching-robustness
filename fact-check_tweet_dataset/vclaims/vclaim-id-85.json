Some claim, \u201cStarting tomorrow [Sunday, March 22, 2020], If You Are CAUGHT In The Streets AFTER CURFEW HOURS & DONT Have An \u2018ESSENTIAL WORKER\u2019 Letter You Will Be ARRESTED & ThereAfter HIT With A $ 2000 FINE.\u201d This claim is false and the video in the claim is over five years old.\n\nThough the post implies that the video in the claim is recent, the footage actually comes from a video uploaded to YouTube ( youtu.be/54v9DiGKRUA) on December 8, 2014. The video\u2019s caption reads, \u201cHERE YOU WILL SEE A UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES MINI CONVOY LEAVING AFTER PARTICIPATING IN THE VETERANS DAY PARADE IN THE MIDTOWN AREA OF MANHATTAN IN NEW YORK CITY.\u201d\n\nThere are currently no curfew hours in place for New York City due to the coronavirus pandemic. The nearby city of Hoboken, New Jersey has issued a night curfew requiring residents to stay home between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m., \u201cexcept for emergencies, or if you are required to work by your employer,\u201d according to Mayor Ravi Bhalla. However, New York City has not followed suit as of March 24, 2020. (here)\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on March 16, 2020 that \u201ceverything\u2019s on the table\u201d when it comes to a possible citywide curfew or road and bridge closures (here). Two days later, the mayor said that he was \u201calmost to the point\u201d of recommending to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo that the city implement a \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d policy that would have people stay in their homes (here).\n\nOn March 20, Governor Cuomo ordered (here) all non-essential workers to stay home and all non-essential businesses to close by 8 p.m. on Sunday, March 22. The definition of \u201cessential businesses\u201d for the purpose of this executive order can be found here .\n\nAt a briefing in Albany, N.Y. (here) on March 20, Cuomo said, \u201cThese provisions will be enforced. These are not helpful hints.\u201d NBC reported here that \u201crestrictions will be enforced with civil fines and mandatory closures of businesses not in compliance.\"\n\nAs for individuals who ignore the mandates, Governor Cuomo said that they would not receive civil fines (here). Mayor de Blasio said that the NYPD would instruct groups of people gathering outside to practice social distancing and ask them to disperse.\n\nThe video seems to suggest current U.S. military presence in New York City due to the coronavirus pandemic. While that is not represented in this particular video, it is true that President Donald Trump said on Sunday, March 22 that the National Guard would help New York, California and Washington state respond to the coronavirus crisis by providing medical supplies and building out medical facilities (here).\n\nIf New York City did impose a curfew, it is not yet clear how it would be enforced. In the case of shelter-in-place orders in Washington, D.C., NPR reported here that \u201cmost states have made violating the orders a misdemeanor, often punishable by a fine.\u201d NPR mentions Maryland state and local police could arrest those who don\u2019t comply, in the case of the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nFalse: This video is from 2014 and shows a U.S. military convoy leaving the Veterans\u2019 Day Parade in New York City. As of March 25 2020 there is no curfew imposed on New York City residents due to the coronavirus pandemic. The National Guard is currently providing New York with medical facilities and supplies.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
