The claim is false; the video has circulated online since 2018 in reports about Indian university students protesting over a separate issue.\n\nThe two minute twenty eight second video was published here in a Facebook post on August 15, 2019. It has been viewed more than 194,000 times and shared more than 12,000 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post's caption states: \u201cAligarh Muslim university of India stand with the people of Jammu kashmir, people are chanting freedom slogans... Free Jammu Kashmir.\u201d\n\nAligarh Muslim University (AMU) refers to a university located in the city of Aligarh in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. The video corresponds with Google user images tagged at the university's location here on Google maps, including this one.\n\nIndia revoked Kashmir's special autonomy on August 5. This AFP report gives details of the developments. Phone and internet services were subsequently cut in the state.\n\nIn the video in the misleading post, protesters can be heard chanting: \"We will take freedom, from- Caste-based reservation, right-wing, oppression, saffron goons whether you shoot us, whether you suppress our voice, we will take freedom. Raise your voice, shout at BJP, Reservation. Long live revolution, long live students union.\"\n\nThe same video has also been shared here and here on Facebook, and here on Twitter alongside a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the video has circulated online since 2018 in reports about AMU students protesting over a separate issue.\n\nIt shows AMU students rallying against right-wing groups after they attempted to remove a portrait of Muhammad Ali Jinnah -- Pakistan\u2019s first leader -- from a building on campus.\n\nA Google reverse image search found the video that was contained in the misleading post was published here on YouTube on May 4, 2018.\n\nThe YouTube video's caption states: \u201cAzadi Slogan in AMU|AMU protest Sloganl\". Azadi means freedom, or independence, in Urdu.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the YouTube video (L) and the video in the misleading posts (R):\n\nA reporter in AFP\u2019s Delhi bureau sent the video in the misleading post to AMU student journalist Faraz Ahmed on August 22, 2019. Ahmed told AFP by Whatsapp the video shows one of several protests held in May 2018.\n\n\u201cThis one is from last year\u2019s protest after some right-wing affiliated people barged into AMU campus and and tried to remove Jinnah's portrait from AMU Student Union\u2019s Office. The protests were held demanding their arrests,\u201d Ahmed told AFP by Whatsapp message on August 22. \u201cThe protest went for several days, but it was called off by the end of the first week of May as Ramazan was approaching.\"\n\nRamazan or Ramadan refers to the holy month when Muslims across the world observe fast during the day.\n\nA Google keyword search found several video and text reports about the protests, for example here and here as well as this article in the Times of India newspaper, a screenshot of which is shown below.\n\nThe report states in part: \u201cA video clip of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) students raising slogans of \u2018azadi\u2019 (freedom) from \u2018RSS and BJP\u2019 in the aftermath of the Jinnah portrait controversy and clashes on campus was widely shared online on Sunday.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
