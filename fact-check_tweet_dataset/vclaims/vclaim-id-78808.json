Lamar Smith, the Environmental Protection Agency and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have been frequent sparring partners. In , Smith, R-San Antonio, took to the San Antonio Express-News to warn readers against .\n\nThe EPA has described the Clean Power Plan as a necessary, though not sufficient, step in addressing climate change -- and as part of a larger strategy to spur other nations to reduce emissions. It was the subject of a previous fact check. The plan is aimed at states with fossil-fuel fired electrical plants.\n\nSmith wrote: \"Texans will be hit even harder than those in other states. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has estimated that the Obama administration\u2019s Power Plan will cause energy costs in Texas to rise as much as 16 percent per year.\" According to the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission , ERCOT manages 90% of the electrical load of Texas; it is a .\n\nThe way the statement is phrased, it sounds as though every year energy costs in Texas will rise 16 percent. But the ERCOT report on the effects of the EPA Clean Power Plan says the increase will be over a longer period of time.\n\nSmith\u2019s statement was based on incorrect information provided by an ERCOT official to his House Science, Space and Technology Committee.\n\nThe ERCOT Oct. 16, 2015 and says that \"energy costs for customers may increase by up to 16% by 2030 due to the CPP alone, without accounting for the associated costs of transmission upgrades, higher natural gas prices caused by increased gas demand, procurement of additional ancillary services, and other costs associated with the retirement or decreased operation of coal-fired capacity in the ERCOT Region\" (ERCOT does not estimate how much these other factors might raise energy costs in their analysis).\n\nIn other words, by 2030, energy costs will have risen 16 percent since the CPP took effect.\n\nSo, how big is the disparity between a 16 percent increase by 2030 and a 16 percent increase each year until 2030?\n\nIt helps to know when the Clean Power Plan is scheduled to come into effect.\n\nAccording to the EPA\u2019s , states with fossil fuel-fired electric generating units need to create plans that set emissions standards for those units. and the District of Columbia are exempt because they have none of the relevant units, and Alaska and Hawaii are exempt because the EPA says it lacks enough information to determine the best system of emission reduction for non-contiguous states.\n\nPlans are due in 2016 (with a possible extension to 2018), and the reduction in emissions needs to start by 2022, with extra rewards for states that also cut emissions in 2020 and 2021.\n\nIf energy costs rise 16 percent each year from 2022 until 2030, that is roughly a 327 percent increase in the cost of energy.\n\nTo help put this in real terms, we crunched some numbers on energy costs in Texas.\n\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration\u2019s Residential Energy Consumption Survey the average annual electricity cost per Texas household at $2,160 in 2009, the last year for which data are available, and of the median household income in Texas . , that\u2019s about $2,394 in 2015.\n\nIf the Clean Power Plan caused energy costs to increase 16 percent by 2030, that bill would rise to about $2,777 in today\u2019s dollars. If energy costs increased 16 percent per year, though, that bill would be $7,828. The median household income in Texas was $53,035 by . The first price would mean Texans would spend of their yearly household income on energy, while the higher number implies energy costs would eat up of income.\n\nSmith, whose 21st Congressional District includes portions of San Antonio, Austin and the Texas Hill Country, is chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, with jurisdiction over the EPA, NOAA and NASA.\n\nA spokeswoman for his committee, Laura Crist, said in an email statement that the congressman\u2019s claim of a 16-percent increase per year was based on communications with ERCOT staff. She noted that the ERCOT estimate is conservative and does not include costs for upgrades.\n\nERCOT, meanwhile, stood by the estimate in the report.\n\n\"It\u2019s the 16 percent by 2030 that\u2019s correct,\" said Robbie Searcy, ERCOT communications manager. Searcy said in a telephone interview that information provided to the House committee \"created a misunderstanding in the congressman\u2019s office and that\u2019s why there was an error.\"\n\nOne of PolitiFact\u2019s is that words matter, and at the very least, Smith's claim is worded ambiguously. The ERCOT analysis and a news release point to an increase in energy costs of 16 percent by 2030. Smith claims that increase per year.\n\nWe rate this claim as False.\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.\n\nClick here for on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE 3:30 p.m., 12/18/15: After publication, Trip Doggett, ERCOT president and chief executive officer, emailed a statement saying Smith\u2019s statement of 16 percent per year was based an erroneous information provided by ERCOT. \"Because ERCOT inadvertently provided incorrect information to the Chairman\u2019s staff, I would like to take this opportunity to state the correct information and offer an apology.\"\n\nThis additional information did not change the rating of our claim.", "lang": "en"}
