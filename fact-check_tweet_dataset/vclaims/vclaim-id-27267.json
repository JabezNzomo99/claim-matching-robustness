The facilities in question are in fact civilian-type buildings for regular peacekeeping training under the United Nations mandate.\n\nRT lists the types of buildings, but refers to them as military facilities. NAVFAC, however, specifically said that it was assessing the readiness of contractors to design and build an office, an apartment building and a hotel. It also gave options to build a townhouse, a school, a trade center, a service station or another apartment building.\n\nMoreover, Moldova\u2019s Defense Ministry, cited by the Moldovan newspaper Ziarul de Garda, stated that the modernization of the training center was initiated under the UN-organized, U.S.-funded Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI), which granted the ministry $1.6 million for this purpose.\n\n\u201cThis activity is not associated with NATO and does not affect the country's neutrality, as was said in the RT material,\u201d the ministry said.\n\nAccording to the U.S. State Department: \u201cAt the 2004 G8 Sea Island Summit, G8 leaders committed to a broad Action Plan for Expanding Global Capability for Peace Support Operations\u2026GPOI was launched as the U.S. contribution to meeting the commitments outlined in the G8 Action Plan.\u201d\n\nThis underscores that the president of Russia, which in 2004 was still a G8 member, also committed to the plan.\n\nBoth Rogozin\u2019s statement and RT\u2019s article create the false impression of an outsized U.S. military influence and presence in Moldova, which is allegedly threatening Russia\u2019s military security and aiming to provoke a conflict in Transdniester by readying Moldovan \u201csaboteurs and special forces.\u201d\n\nUnlike Russia, the United States does not have military forces stationed in Moldova or Transdniester. However, like Russia and other states, the United States provides training assistance to various countries and conducts joint military drills to improve their capabilities.\n\nRussia has been concerned about pro-Western views and the desire to join NATO expressed by some Moldovan elites, mounting a strong information campaign to oppose this. Underscoring the tensions between the two countries, Moldova earlier this month declared Rogozin persona non grata, barring him from entering the country.", "lang": "en"}
