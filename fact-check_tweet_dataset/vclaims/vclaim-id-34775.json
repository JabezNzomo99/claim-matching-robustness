The survey did not ask respondents whether or not they would be seeing their children on Father's Day in 2019.\n\nIn fact, the survey found that 37% of fathers with children under 18 have not seen their children on at least one Father\u2019s Day or know a parent who has experienced the same.\n\nA total of 21% of those surveyed had experienced it at least once themselves, but this still does not imply 21% of fathers would have been apart from their children this year.\n\nThe Telegraph subsequently corrected their online story\u2014it now says one in five fathers, rather than four in ten.\n\nThe question was asked of a sample of just over 1,000 fathers with children under 18 and weighted so the respondents were demographically representative of fathers in Great Britain.\n\nIt seems the source of the error is the press release put out by the campaign group who commissioned the survey, Fathers4Justice.\n\nThe release goes on to accurately report the survey results, but its headline and first line wrongly claim that \"a third of dads (37 per cent) will not see their children on Father's Day\" \u2013 the claim that several newspapers then repeated in their coverage.\n\nWe don't know why some dads didn't see their children on Father's Day\n\nAn editorial in the Sunday Express claimed: \"Four in ten fathers will not see their precious youngsters today due to separation and family breakdown.\"\n\nAside from the problems mentioned with this \u201cfour in ten\u201d figure, nobody knows if these fathers/parents are not seeing their children because of separation and family breakdown.\n\nRespondents were not asked the reason they or someone they knew failed to see their children on the Father's Day(s) they missed.\n\nThey could, for example, have been unable to be with them on the day because of travel difficulties, a work commitment or for any other reason unrelated to family breakdown.", "lang": "en"}
