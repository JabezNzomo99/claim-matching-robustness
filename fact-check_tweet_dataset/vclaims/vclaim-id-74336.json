From Black magic, underworld links to despicable reporting, there seems to be no end to speculations and discussions on television channels and social media alike.\n\nIn between all the noise, a new theory has received special attention on social media. A picture is being shared of two people sitting in a car \u2014 on the driver\u2019s seat is Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray\u2019s son and Maharashtra MLA Aditya Thackeray while an unidentified woman is seated on the passenger seat. The picture was tweeted by a parody account of Republic TV\u2019s managing director and editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami with the claim that Aditya Thackeray and Rhea Chakraborty have been roaming together which is why a CBI probe on Rajput\u2019s suicide is yet to be initiated. The tweet has been liked by over 14,000 users.\n\nThe picture has been shared to raise doubts about the police investigation. It is important to note here that Rhea Chakraborty is being blamed both by mainstream media and social media for Rajput\u2019s alleged mental illness. The same picture and claim have been tweeted from the parody account of Nita Ambani which has received more than 4,300 likes.\n\nAnother tweet by @Krishna29892392 also makes the same claim which has been liked by over 1,000 users. The picture and the claim have gone viral on Facebook as well.\n\nThe woman in the picture is not Rhea Chakraborty\n\nThe fact-check for this claim is pretty simple. If one carefully notices the photograph, one can spot that the woman seated beside Aditya Thackeray is actor Disha Patani. A reverse-image search on Google also picks up the same.\n\nThe picture was featured in a video report published by The Times of India\u2019s entertainment section, E-Times, dated March 11, 2019, where it has reported that \u201cAditya Thackeray and Disha Patani went on a lunch date\u2019\u2019. You can see the screenshot of this below where the picture in question is visible.\n\nA video of this event was uploaded on YouTube on March 11, 2019.\n\nNote: This report does not intend to make any claims about the personal relationship between Aditya Thackeray and Disha Patani. Alt News requests readers to be mindful about celebrities\u2019 private lives. The only information that this article has verified is that Disha Patani was misidentified as Rhea Chakraborty in the viral photograph which was wrongly linked with Sushant Singh Rajput\u2019s death.", "lang": "en"}
