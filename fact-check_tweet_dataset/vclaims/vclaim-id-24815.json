A small beamer maps an image of a different face over your own and gives you a new appearance.\u201d When the video went viral in October 2019 connected to the claim that it depicted protesters in Hong Kong, Liu added: \u201cMy project has NOTHING to do with political purposes!\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s an image of the face projector being displayed at an art exhibit:\n\nA statement posted to Liu\u2019s website explained that this wearable face projector was an art project and that most of the models used for the project were non-working conceptual versions. Liu also explained that these wearable projectors were never manufactured and were never intended for political purposes.\n\nHere\u2019s the statement from Liu and others who worked on this project (emphasis ours):\n\nIn 2017, five Dutch product design students of the Utrecht School of arts, Jing-cai Liu, Sanne Weekers, Joppe Besseling, Jip van Leeuwenstein, and Marcel Coufreur designed a few conceptual products. The products were about staying anonymous in a fictional, futuristic world where face-recognizing is a big thing. The designs should provoke debates about emerging future-technologies and/or marketing strategies. Those five students presented their work on YouTube as seen here and went to the Milan design week to present their concepts. More info here: Lately, the video, and especially the work \u201cwearable face projector\u201d by Jing-cai Liu [has been] used in the context of the Hong Kong protest. Jing-cai Liu and the other members of the design project want to clearly state that they have had no political intentions with their works, not then, not now. They also want to state that most of the works are not-working concepts and they have no interest in manufacturing those products. The copyright of the product/concepts stays in the hands of those designers. They kindly ask to put their works in the right context and always refer back to their websites or named above sources when their concepts are shared. Don\u2019t use their works in any political statement.", "lang": "en"}
