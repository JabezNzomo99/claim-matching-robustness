In the viral video, some people can be seen beating him, cutting his hair and making him drink some liquid. People can be heard abusing him and speaking in a dialect.\n\n\n\nThe Logical Indian is not sharing the video here due to its disturbing nature. \"Dalit oppression is at a peak in Rajasthan. Some dominate caste mob torturing a Dalit, man tied with rope and forcing to drink urine publically,\" reads the caption of one such post by the Twitter user The Dalit Voice. The tweet was shared over 4000 times.\n\nAccording to the report, a man hailing from Rajasthan's Barmer district was tied to a tree, beaten and forced to drink urine over an alleged illicit relationship on July 25. The police got to know about the incident on July 31, when the video surfaced online.\n\nAlthough the viral posts claimed that the victim was made to drink urine, the police official said that they were yet to verify it. According to Ajit Singh, circle officer in Chohtan, the victim and accused belonged to the same community and due to this, the man did not approach the police to lodge a complaint. The Logical Indian reached out to Khinv Singh Bhati, Additional SP, Barmer who confirmed that there was no caste angle at all, since everyone involved belonged to the same caste. They were all Dalits. The statement can be accessed here.\n\nBarmer Police replied from their official Twitter handle to the tweet by 'The Dalit Voice' and clarified that the video was being shared with a false claim of Dalit oppression. \"In this video, it is wrong to say that a Dalit person was tortured by the dominant caste. Whereas the reality is that the incident took place 5 days ago over a family dispute. Police booked 6 people after registering an FIR on their behalf,\" the Barmer police wrote.\n\nTherefore, the men in the video belonged to the same community and the incident occurred due to a family dispute.\n\n If you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343 Also Read: Fact Check: Video Of A Man Brutally Being Thrashed Shared With Communal Claim", "lang": "en"}
