Jayarajan of Valancheri committed suicide after the desecration of the #Sabarimala temple by Maoist women activists. He is the fourth devotee to die brokenhearted in 2 months. #SabarimalaTemple is such an emotive issue here,\" the tweet said.\n\nA right-wing Twitter handle @ShankhNaad, known for tweeting communal sensitive images and videos also tweeted the same information claiming that \"this blood is in the hands of those who violated our faith.\"\n\nSeveral Facebook posts also went viral with the same narrative.\n\nHowever, BOOM's fact check reveals that Jayarajan had committed suicide on January 1, 2019 at around 8pm.\n\nPramod P, Station House Officer at Valanchery Police Station, who dealt with the suicide case said that Jayarajan's suicide was not linked to the controversy around entry of women at Sabarimala.\n\nReading the police report to BOOM, the official said that Jayarajan had committed suicide on January 1, 2019, at around 8pm in his own land behind his house.\n\n\u201cHis death was reported by his brother-in-law at the police station. We carried out the procedures and are waiting for the post-mortem report,\u201d Pramod said.\n\nThe tweet had claimed that Jayarajan committed suicide after the 'desecration of the #Sabarimala temple by Maoist women activists'.\n\nHowever, Kanaka Durga and Bindhu Ammini, had trekked to Sabarimala only on January 2, 2019, at around 3:45am and returned at around 4:10am.\n\nIt was also widely reported that hours after their entry on January 2 at 10:35am, the chief priest closed the Sabarimala for carrying out purification rituals. The temple was re-opened at 11:25am that day.\n\nBut according to the report filed at the police station, Jayarajan\u2019s suicide took place nearly 8 hours before Durga and Ammini's entry at the Sabarimala shrine.", "lang": "en"}
