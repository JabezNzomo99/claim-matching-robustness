The posts read: \u201cMark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, created a new word GRATULA. To keep your account safe, write GRATULA in the comment. If Red, your account is still safe, if it does not change the red, please change your password. Your account is already hacked.\u201d\n\nA reader sent one of the posts to Rappler\u2019s fact-checking group on Facebook for verification. Facebook Claim Check, the platform\u2019s monitoring tool, also flagged at least 7 posts carrying the same claim.\n\n\u201cGratula\u201d means congrats in Hungarian. Typing it or the word \u201ccongrats\u201d in Facebook comments activates the platform\u2019s text delight animation, which also changes the word\u2019s font color. When clicked, emojis would also pop up and fly across the screen.\n\nThere are other keywords that could trigger the animation, such as \u201cbest wishes,\u201d \u201crad,\u201d and \u201cBFF.\u201d A compilation of keywords can be found here.\n\nFacebook also has several suggestions to keep an account secure, but typing a certain word in the comments is not among them. Facebook\u2019s security features include login alerts and two-factor authentication. Read more about Facebook\u2019s privacy and security features here.\n\nA cursory search showed that the claim also circulated in France way back in 2018, and was then debunked by French fact checker 20 Minutes. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
