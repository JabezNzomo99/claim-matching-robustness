The White House did little to explain his comments, not responding to a query. Although eventually a partial transcript was released, the New York Times article left the impression that Trump was referring to officials seeking the identities of Trump associates who were swept up in the surveillance of foreign officials by American spy agencies. But the actual conversation is murky, leaving open the possibility that the president thought another crime had been committed, such as leaking classified information.\n\nOn the face of it, Trump\u2019s assertion is absurd. Numerous former national security officials told The Fact Checker that Rice, as national security adviser, had every right to request the identities of U.S. citizens who were incidentally recorded or referenced in surveillance conducted by the National Security Agency. Generally, intelligence reports would come to the national security adviser with the names of U.S. citizens redacted, replaced by a phrase such as \u201cU.S. person 1.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be on her desk in the first place, the report must already have intelligence in the first place or NSA would not have published it, especially if it involved any U.S. person information,\u201d said former NSA director Michael V. Hayden. \u201cSo the original intelligence value judgment is made by a career intelligence professional at NSA.\u201d\n\nHayden said that the NSA \u201cis notoriously conservative about including U.S. person information. Once out, it\u2019s out. Better to not include and let people ask.\u201d Then, \u201cwhen the request to unmask is made, it is adjudicated again at NSA by analysts and lawyers. Sometimes they say yes. Sometimes they say no. The basic question is does this person need this information to understand the intelligence value of this report to do their job?\u201d\n\nAs Hayden referenced, several former NSC officials suggested there could be questions raised about abuse of power. A Bloomberg opinion article said that Rice made \u201cdozens\u201d of requests to learn the names of individuals redacted in intelligence reports. That figure has not been confirmed. Rice, in an interview with MSNBC, simply said \u201cthere were occasions\u201d when she requested the name \u201cin order to understand the importance of that report and assess its significance.\u201d She said the Obama administration did not use intelligence for political purposes, but she refused to say whether she requested the names of Trump transition officials.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that the names of two U.S. citizens who were part of Trump\u2019s transition team were unmasked in intelligence reports. One person was Michael Flynn, who served briefly as Trump\u2019s national security adviser until he was fired for misleading other administration officials about the nature of conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Those conversations were monitored by the NSA, but the WSJ said that Rice did not instigate Flynn\u2019s unmasking. Instead, the paper said Rice requested the unmasking of another (unnamed) transition official who was \u201cpart of multiple foreign conversations that weren\u2019t related to Russia.\u201d\n\nRice could have discussed the information she had learned from the intelligence reports with Obama administration colleagues, who in turn might have discussed it with reporters. But Marcy Wheeler, who writes on intelligence matters, estimates that 15 to 20 people would have access just to raw intercepts, suggesting the circle of people who knew this information could be quite wide even before people in the Obama administration might have gossiped about it.\n\nReaders can judge for themselves, but Rice tends to stick to her talking points. This is what got her in trouble \u2014 and earned her Pinocchios \u2014 when she famously insisted in 2012 that the Benghazi attacks were not planned in advance, even as the Libyan president appeared on the same Sunday programs to say, \u201cThis was preplanned, predetermined.\u201d\n\nThe truthfulness of the answer is hard to gauge. If she was just deflecting a question because she didn\u2019t know enough about Nunes\u2019s claims, she did it in an awkward manner. Rice\u2019s quick dismissal raised suspicions because she appeared to say she knew nothing about a practice that we now know she actively used.", "lang": "en"}
