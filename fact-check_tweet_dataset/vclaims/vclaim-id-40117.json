Some of his best known works, like the books \u201cBrave New World\u201d and \u201cThe Doors of Perception,\u201d are widely considered classics.\n\nHowever, nowhere in this work, or any of his others, could the Daily Caller News Foundation find the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. There is no record of the statement in the archive of his writings housed at the University of California, Los Angeles Library. A search of his collected works, essays, poems and short stories also turned up no matches.\n\nThe Daily Caller also reached out to several experts, none of whom thought the quote sounded like something Huxley would write.\n\n\u201cI doubt that this rather simplistic sentence comes from Aldous Huxley,\u201d said Bernfried Nugel, chairman of the Aldous Huxley Society, in an email to the DCNF.\n\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have made such a crass distinction between \u2018things known\u2019 and \u2018things unknown,'\u201d biographer Nicholas Murray told the DCNF via email. \u201cFor him they were all part of the same spectrum.\u201d\n\nHuxley\u2019s book \u201cThe Doors of Perception,\u201d which details his experience with taking the psychedelic drug mescaline, drew its title from a line written by poet William Blake in his 1790 book \u201cThe Marriage of Heaven and Hell,\u201d according to Murray. Both works later provided inspiration to the rock band The Doors in choosing their band name.\n\nThe website Quote Investigator did find a partial matches for the expression in Blake\u2019s 1790 book, in which he wrote, \u201cIf the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite.\u201d\n\nHowever, Quote Investigator believes that the quote may actually be a variation of a statement that The Doors co-founder and keyboardist Ray Manzarek said in a Newsweek profile. \u201cThere are things you know about,\u201d Manzarek is quoted as saying in the 1967 interview, \u201cand things you don\u2019t, the known and the unknown, and in between are the doors \u2013 that\u2019s us.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
