The Northern Ireland Government funds the provision of pre-school education, which in the rest of the UK, Ireland, and wider Europe is defined as \u201cEarly Childhood Education and Care\u201d. Residents of Northern Ireland are also eligible for some UK-wide childcare subsidy schemes.\n\nThe Ulster Unionist Party claimed in their 2019 Manifesto that UUP MPs would \u201cend the scandal of Northern Ireland remaining the only UK jurisdiction without funded childcare provision\u201d, adding that they will \u201csupport calls for the full implementation of a Childcare Strategy, with specific objectives supported by legislation\u201d.\n\nA basic definition of childcare is the care and supervision of a child or multiple children at a time. Childcare can take place in the following environments:\n\u2022 in a child\u2019s home (e.g. by parents, nannies, au pairs, friends and family)\n\u2022 in a daycare centre/day nursery (e.g. by \u201cEarly Years\u201d specialists and other teachers)\n\nIn England, the statutory agency, OFSTED, inspects and regulates childminders and premises where childminding and daycare is provided, for those under the age of five. OFSTED is also responsible for the inspection of state schools and other education institutions where childcare takes place.\n\nIn Scotland, the relevant agency is Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Education (HMIe), which is charged with inspecting the quality of education in pre-school centres, as well as primary, secondary, and other types of schools. The Scottish Government combined the terms \u201cearly learning\u201d and \u201cchildcare\u201d, and is applicable to those under the age of five.\n\nIn Wales, childcare is defined as \u201cprovision during which the needs of the child (care, play and education) are delegated to, and accepted, by a third party in absence of a parent\u201d. Also, the Welsh Government defines \u201cEarly Childhood Education and Care\u201d (ECEC) employing the terminology used at European level [indeed, globally] to describe services \u201cthat broadly combine education and care in one seamless experience for young children and their families\u201d.\n\nIn Ireland, the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme provides for \u201cchildren of pre-school age\u201d.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, Early Years Teams \u2014 specialist teams of social workers within Health and Social Care (HSC) Trusts \u2014 are responsible for the registration, inspection, monitoring and support of childminders and day care providers.\n\nIn consideration of all terminology above, for the purpose of evaluating this claim, we used a definition of childcare as \u201cprovision of care, play, and education to those under the age of five\u201d (i.e. before enrolment in primary school).\n\nWhat childcare is funded by Northern Ireland?\n\nThere is no Northern Ireland Government funded programme for childcare for those aged under 3.\n\nThe Department of Education sponsors a Pre-School Education Programme, which funds education for children in the year before they start primary school. The Department defines this as \u201cfunded pre-school education\u201d and \u201cnot free or funded childcare\u201d. The Department of the Environment is distinguishing between services provided by childminders (e.g. in a childminder\u2019s home) and services provided by early years specialists (e.g. in a nursery school).\n\nUnder this programme, most pre-schools in Northern Ireland offer 12.5 hours per week as \u201cpart-time\u201d places of 2.5 hours a day (see \u201cWhat is a funded Pre-School?\u201d), 475 hours per year, spread over at least 38 weeks of term from September to June. However, some pre-schools offer \u201cfull-time\u201d places of 4.5 hours a day. According to the Education Authority website, 212 out of 721 pre-schools in Northern Ireland offer at least some full-time places of 4.5 hours a day (855 hours a year), 29% of pre-schools overall.\n\nWhat state funded childcare is provided elsewhere?\n\nThe following table summarises state funded childcare provision in Northern Ireland, England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland, and how this is classified by the relevant government.\n\n* The Scottish government has a target to expand provision for 3-4 year olds and eligible 2 year olds to 1,140 hours a year by August 2020. This expansion programme is already underway, so some children are already receiving in excess of 600 hours a year of funded childcare.\n\nCan residents of Northern Ireland avail of UK-wide childcare schemes?\n\nIn addition to funded pre-school education, people in Northern Ireland can apply for various UK-wide subsidised childcare schemes. A contribution is given to parents towards childcare in a range of approved settings such as with a registered childminder, play scheme, nursery, club, a school registered to provide childcare or an approved home childcarer.\n\nTax-free childcare was introduced in 2017 and began to roll out in Northern Ireland from 2018. For children under 12, parents and carers can set up an account to pay for approved childcare, and the government will top this up by 20%. NI Direct explains that \u201cfor every \u00a38.00 you pay in, the government adds \u00a32.00 to your account\u201d.\n\nFor people working over 16 hours a week, the Childcare Element of Working Tax Credit was a means-dependent contribution towards childcare costs. This scheme is being phased out across the UK, and replaced with Universal Credit. Some people in Northern Ireland continue to receive the Childcare Element of Working Tax Credit. Universal Credit also has a childcare element for working families for children up to 16. Subsidies are means-dependent, and neither scheme pays the full cost of childcare (the maximum that can be awarded under Universal Credit is 85% of childcare costs).\n\nA UK childcare voucher scheme has been closed to new applicants since October 2018. This saw the government allow \u00a355 per week of someone\u2019s income to be tax free.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Government funds the provision of childcare in a daycare/nursery/pre-school environment, through its Pre-School Education Programme.\n\nNorthern Ireland defines early years provision differently than England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, and elsewhere in Europe. It classifies this provision as \u201cpre-school education\u201d, in contrast to \u201cearly education and childcare\u201d.\n\nUK-wide childcare subsidy schemes are available in Northern Ireland, but none of them are designed to cover all the costs.\n\nIt is the case that Northern Ireland has no official childcare strategy, and no childcare objectives supported by legislation.\n\nImage: Photo by Ian Allenden used by license Dreamstime.com\n\nFactCheckNI is Northern Ireland\u2019s first and only dedicated independent fact-checking service and a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network\u2019s Code of Principles.
