Congress is with everyone \u2013 Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians -translated)\u201d. This was an attempt to convey that only Congress can unite people from different religious identities together.\n\nThis image was also posted on the official Facebook page of Gujarat Youth Congress.\n\nA Facebook page, 60 years of Congress had also posted this image with an identical text on April 5.\n\nAlt News found that the image, which has the religious leaders holding the INC flag, is photoshopped. In the original image, the religious leaders were seen holding the Indian National flag and NOT the INC flag. The picture was clicked at Wagah Border, Amritsar in 2016 where interfaith saints including Swami Dipankar, Acharya Lokesh Muni, Sushil Goswami, Dr Imam Ilyasi and Paramjit Singh Chandhok were seen marching on the Wagah border with the Indian National flag.\n\nEarlier, the same image was photoshopped with Samajwadi party\u2019s flag and Swami Dipankar had called it out on Twitter.", "lang": "en"}
