It was the third year in a row the president\u2019s budget has proposed gutting federal funding for the program. To date, Congress has ignored those proposed cuts.\n\nTrump is also wrong about his geography. While the Great Lakes are indeed big, they\u2019re not exceptionally deep.\n\nThe Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, or GLRI, began in 2010 under President Obama with the aim of cleaning up the most polluted areas of the Great Lakes. Since then, more than 4,000 projects have focused on improving water quality, restoring habitats and combating invasive species.\n\nIn its first fiscal year, Obama recommended \u2014 and the initiative received \u2014 $475 million. After that high point, funding dropped in fiscal year 2011 to just under $300 million. And funding has stayed steady around that level ever since.\n\nIn his last two budget proposals, including the fiscal year 2020 budget released this month, Trump proposed just $30 million \u2014 the equivalent of a 90 percent cut. In his first proposed budget for fiscal year 2018, the president allotted zero funding for the program.\n\nIn a document explaining the justification for the funding shift, the Environmental Protection Agency wrote in both 2018 and 2019, \u201cThis program change reduces support for the Great Lakes Program. This returns responsibility for local government efforts to state and local entities.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that a president\u2019s budget proposal is more a symbolic statement of priorities than something Congress would vote on. In the past, Congress has chosen to ignore the White House calls to slash the GLRI budget. The last two congressionally approved budgets \u2014 which Trump signed \u2014 retained funding of about $300 million a year.\n\nExplaining Trump\u2019s position change on Great Lakes funding, a senior administration official told us via email, \u201cThe President trusts his agencies and staff to implement his goals and vision, but when specific issues, like the Great Lakes restoration, are presented to him he has every right to take a different approach. His announcement last night to increase his funding request for this worthy project does not change the overall goals of the budget and we will work with Congress to ensure the President\u2019s priorities and agenda are advanced on behalf of the American people.\u201d\n\nWe also reached out to the EPA for comment, and John Konkus, a deputy associate administrator for public affairs at EPA, replied via email, \u201cAs the President stated, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is unique both as an inter-agency initiative and because it is an international watershed. It was because of constraints in our budget that it was not fully funded at the authorized amount, but we certainly agree with and support the direction of the President as it relates to this very important program.\u201d\n\nFinally, Trump exaggerated the depth of the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes can claim a handful of superlatives, but depth isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nThe deepest of the five lakes, according to figures assembled by the EPA, is Lake Superior, which boasts a maximum depth of 1,332 feet. That\u2019s well short of Oregon\u2019s Crater Lake, which at 1,949 feet is the domestic record holder. And globally, Lake Baikal, located in Russia just north of Mongolia, is the world\u2019s deepest lake. It stretches down some 5,300-plus feet, or more than a mile.\n\nUpdate, April 1: A reader suggested that Trump might have been referring to the current water levels of the Great Lakes, which have been high recently. We asked the White House to explain what the president meant by \u201crecord deepness,\u201d but did not receive a reply.\n\nBut even if Trump was referring to the water levels, he\u2019s still wrong about the depth. According to data posted on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer\u2019s Detroit District website, none of the lakes are at record high water levels.\n\nLake Superior is the closest to breaking a record, but its average daily mean water level in March was still 1.8 inches below the 1986 record.", "lang": "en"}
