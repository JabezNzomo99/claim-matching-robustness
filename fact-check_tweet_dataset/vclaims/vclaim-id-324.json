The video has been altered by splicing segments of the former Vice President speaking, which is evident when comparing the original interview with the version posted online.\n\nMany iterations of this claim stem from videos posted on YouTube ( here ) and on Twitter ( here ). Users poke fun at Biden\u2019s seemingly awkward answer, with tweets reading, \u201cThis video of Slow Uncle Joe clearly displays to all of America that he can\u2019t synchronize his thinking and speaking so as to be coherent and understandable\u201d and \u201cThis is sad. For once the women on The View are speechless. He clearly has health problems.\u201d These replies make it apparent users believe the edited video to be authentic.\n\nBiden appeared on The View to discuss his election campaign among other topics of conversation on April 25, 2019, and the clips were posted on The View\u2019s YouTube channel the following day ( here ).\n\nThe version of the video circulating on social media has been edited to make Biden\u2019s answers appear incoherent. His actual answers during the segment show the former VP addressing the hosts\u2019 questions. The actual exchange is visible here . The View also tweeted a clip showing Biden\u2019s real response when addressing inappropriate touching allegations as a standalone clip at the time, visible here .\n\nThe claims and comments on the edited version of the video on social media also make mention of how \u201cthe women on The View are speechless\u201d. This is because the edited video includes clips from different moments in that day\u2019s episode.\n\nThe edited video shows Sunny Hostin (at 0:38 here ) looking \u201cspeechless\u201d and surprised. This actually comes from a separate segment in the same View episode, visible on their YouTube channel at 1:22, where the hosts are discussing then presidential candidate Mayor Pete Buttigieg ( here ).\n\nThe edited video shows Meghan McCaine nodding and staring (at 1:12 here ). This actually comes from the same segment as above, when the hosts are discussing Buttigieg (the moment is visible at 1:25 here ).\n\nThroughout the edited video, a bug can be seen in the upper right corner referencing the Daily Caller News Foundation comedy. Reuters could not find an instance of this edited video anywhere on the Daily Caller\u2019s website. The Daily Caller does, however, carry the authentic clip of Biden\u2019s appearance on the April 25, 2019 episode of The View ( here ).\n\nFalse. This video has been edited to change the content of Biden\u2019s responses. His actual responses can be seen in authentic clips posted by The View on YouTube and Twitter.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
