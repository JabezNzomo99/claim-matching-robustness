The update said that as of August 2018, some 500,000 graduates were working in sectors like teaching, health, agriculture and tax. The graduates are volunteers but are paid a monthly stipend of N30,000 (about US$98) by the government.\n\nSome 26,000 non-graduates are in training or are interns, the update said. A year later in\n\nwith a national newspaper, Mary Uwais, a top official with the N-Power programme, cited the same numbers.\n\nIt is unlikely that N-Power could have created multiple employment opportunities,\n\n, a development economist who teaches at the\n\nThis is because it is not really an entrepreneurship programme, he told Africa Check. \u201cI don\u2019t think it can really generate many indirect jobs, because many of the beneficiaries are engaged in teaching in schools and as health workers. \u201cAnd they are paid N30,000 a month. They can\u2019t build businesses that employ many people.\u201d\n\nThe programme says it provides training and information on entrepreneurship, but does not break down how many of its beneficiaries have started their own businesses.\n\nMore details needed about where the jobs are\n\nTo support its jobs claim, the government should have given details, including where the jobs are located, Orji said.\n\n\u201cIdeally, it is the\n\nthat should verify and present the numbers from the programme,\u201d he said. But the national data agency does not have any role in the programme including verifying jobs, Dr Isiaka Olanrewaju, the agency\u2019s director of household statistics, told Africa Check.\n\nAccording to the most recent data, some 55.4% of Nigerian youths between ages 15 to 35 are\n\n24.5 million youth who are doing in-between jobs, or have nothing to do.\n\nthe most recent official data, some 43.1% of all Nigerians, or 39.14 million, are either unemployed or underemployed. These numbers, from the third quarter of 2018, are the most recent yet.\n\nIn the absence of publicly available data showing how the 2 million jobs supposedly created by N-Power are distributed, we rate this claim as unproven.\n\nanyone living on less than US$2 a day as poor, and as extremely poor if they live on less than $1.25 a day.\n\nThe most recent nationally representative survey of poverty was in\n\n. For this, the\n\ndrew the absolute poverty line at N55,235 per person per year, with\n\nIn a preceding survey in 2003/04, some 64.2% of Nigerians were classified as absolutely poor, with the poverty line drawn at N28,837.\n\nThere have been more recent attempts at estimating absolute poverty in Nigeria.

This is anyone earning less than $1.90 at 2011 internationally adjusted prices, Kristopher Hamel, the CEO of World Data Lab, which calculates the data, told Africa\n\nAn expert told Africa Check that without open numbers the claim that N-Power has lifted 5 million Nigerians out of extreme poverty is difficult to verify. Dr Olukemi Lawanson, an\n\nat the University of Lagos said that the government should produce the evidence to support its position.\n\n\u201cIf the N-Power programme has yielded about 500,000 jobs for graduates, it does not seem likely to me that those jobs could have resulted in lifting up to 5 million Nigerians out of extreme poverty,\u201d Lawanson told Africa Check.\n\n\u201cBut then it is possible depending on the kind of jobs and how much they pay. The government should present the facts to prove it.\u201d\n\nLawanson said that if, for instance, a graduate gets a job paying the\n\nof N30,000 monthly, they are not likely to be above extreme poverty if they support at least one person, which is usually the case.\n\n\u201cEarning N30,000 in a month comes down to living on about $3 in a day for one person. When you add dependants to it, they all remain in extreme poverty.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
