As you know, South Africa built four nuclear weapons, and when Nelson Mandela wanted to get rid of them, he agreed to anytime, anywhere inspections. So international inspectors could go, even go through his underwear in his home at any time, at any place, looking for evidence of nukes.\u201d\n\nThe history has been fairly well-documented. The apartheid regime of South Africa had embarked on a secret nuclear weapons program in the 1970s and ultimately built six nuclear weapons (not four, as Kirk stated), each with 55 kilograms of highly-enriched uranium. In September 1989, newly elected President F.W. de Klerk \u2014 the last white president of the country \u2014 told officials he had decided to dismantle the program.\n\nBut this is historically inaccurate as well. Initially, the South Africa government chose not to tell the International Atomic Energy Agency that it had a secret bomb program. As Waldo Stumpf, the head of South Africa\u2019s Atomic Energy Corp., explained in 1995, officials believed the country\u2019s \u201cinternal political transformation process\u201d was not ready for such an announcement. Moreover, the stand-off at the time between Iraq and the IAEA over Baghdad\u2019s nuclear program made South African officials fearful that they would become a \u201csecond Iraqi case.\u201d\n\nBut Albright noted that South Africa did not provide complete transparency, as there were two key areas in which South Africa said it would not provide information \u2014 foreign procurement and delivery systems for nuclear weapons. South Africa also would not reveal its nuclear strategy. Many documents were also destroyed by the time the inspectors arrived, as Albright noted in a 1994 report: \u201cBy March 24, 1993, when de Klerk announced the program\u2019s existence, most of the classified documents had been shredded and the sensitive weapon components destroyed or damaged beyond repair.\u201d\n\nOlli Heinonen, who once headed the IAEA\u2019s safeguards section, said the caveat of \u201cwithin reason\u201d meant \u201cthat the IAEA had to give a justification. But there was never \u2014 best to my knowledge \u2014 any argumentation or delays in access. We used it still occasionally until 2010 when I left the IAEA.\u201d He noted that \u201cthe commitment was done by President de Klerk, but the implementation was facilitated also by the governments following the one of his.\u201d\n\nNot to get too much in the weeds, but some nuclear experts think it is misguided to cite South Africa as a model for Iran. De Klerk\u2019s action to dismantle the weapons was a unilateral move, made without negotiations. There was nothing \u201csigned\u201d with the international community, as Kirk put it; joining the NPT was a later step. Moreover, \u201cthe South African offer [of access] was a voluntary one,\u201d noted Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Non-Proliferation program at the James Martin Center for Non-Proliferation Studies.\n\n\u201cWhat South Africa intended was more or less the same access that would eventually be provided for in the IAEA Additional Protocol \u2014 something that didn\u2019t exist when South Africa came clean,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cSince Pretoria\u2019s offer was a voluntary one to avoid an adversarial \u2018special inspection,\u2019 I can\u2019t find any evidence that the IAEA insisted that South Africa spell out its obligations. Iran, by contrast, will be obliged to comply with the Additional Protocol, which is far more specific about what Iran must accept than Stumpf\u2019s vague \u2018within reason\u2019 test for the \u2018case by case\u2019 access offered to the IAEA to inspect non-weapons related sites.\u201d\n\nTo some extent, Kirk\u2019s advocacy of using South Africa as an example is a matter of opinion. But it\u2019s important to get the history right. Kirk, on at least two occasions, has gotten the history very wrong, making it hard to say he simply misspoke.\n\nWhile Mandela continued the process that De Klerk set in motion, and certainly supported nonproliferation efforts, he had nothing to do with South Africa\u2019s decision to end the program, dismantle the weapons or invite the inspectors to make unfettered inspections (after first failing to disclose the weapons program). It is pretty astonishing that Kirk would claim this was all of Mandela\u2019s doing.", "lang": "en"}
