Subsequent media reports declared \u201cbursting of crackers\u201d as the motive behind the murder. Barring a few local reports, most news organisations stated that Amaresh Nayak was murdered in the state capital for bursting crackers.\n\nSudarshan Newsdrew parallels with the murder of Hindu Samaj leader Kamlesh Tiwari and suggested a hand of \u201creligious fanatics\u201d behind Nayak\u2019s death.\n\nThe incident garnered substantial outrage on social media, with several users expressing rage over \u201cHindus\u201d unable to burst crackers even on the occasion of Diwali.\n\nMany stressed on Nayak\u2019s religious identity thus alluding communal motivation behind the crime.\n\nTwitter handle @RealHistoriPix infamous for circulating misinformation blamed \u2018peacefuls\u2019 for the murder. \u2018Peacefuls\u2019 is a derogatory term used on social media for the Muslim community.\n\nIn a conversation with Alt News, DCP Bhubaneshwar Anup Sahoo said, \u201cAll the accused have been identified. There is no communal angle at all,\u201d further informing that the victim and the accused belong to the same community. The police have identified 10-12 persons but the exact number will be ascertained after the arrests are made.\n\nOn October 28, DCP Sahoo had informed the media, \u201cThe scientific team inspected the whole scene and collected samples. Several unblasted cracker bombs were found on the scene, however, it is yet to be ascertained whether they were planted before or after the murder.\u201d The officer also stated that the deceased and others identified in the case had several cases lodged against them. Local reports carry similar allegations by area residents who said that Nayak was involved in criminal cases.\n\nMURDER NOT DUE TO BURSTING OF CRACKERS; GROUP CLASH\n\nDCP Sahoo informed that \u201cbursting of crackers\u201d was not the motive behind the murder, \u201cNo, it was actually a verbal duel between two groups. It was out of sudden provocation not because he burst crackers.\u201d The officer stated that the two groups shared \u201cpast enmity\u201d and a minor altercation led to the assault and subsequent death of the victim.\n\nIncidentally, most media reports gave the impression that Nayak was individually targetted. However, it was a group clash where two others were also injured, reported Ommcom News.\n\nThe police had initially detained a local ex-contractor Mantu Nanda as his name was mentioned in the complaint. Orissa TV reported that Nanda was later released following protests by his supporters.\n\nA complainant in the case, Debi Prasad Sethi, gave some of the names of the alleged accused \u2013 \u201cWe were partying as well as bursting crackers when some youths came and asked us to stop the celebrations. Raghua, a youth among them brandished a gun at us while two others, Kuna and Babul attacked us with sharp weapons. I somehow managed to escape the spot and informed the matter to Amaresh\u2019s family.\u201d\n\nThe statements of police and complainants in the case affirm that the incident was not communal in nature but sparked by an altercation between two opposing groups. Media reports declared \u201cbursting of crackers\u201d as the motive behind the murder. However, crucial details such as the victim and accused hailing from the same community and \u201cpersonal and past enmity\u201d leading to the attack were not offered in the reports. This subsequently nourished false, communally-charged claims propagated on social media. Furthermore, the reports were centred around the deceased without supplementary information that the attack was a group clash.", "lang": "en"}
