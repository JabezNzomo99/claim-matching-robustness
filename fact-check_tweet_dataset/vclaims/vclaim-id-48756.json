No, that's not true: The National Guard has issued a tweet refuting those claims. The item has been copied-and-pasted from chain letters, text messages, and other social media posts.\n\nIt purports to be from the user's \"contact at FEMA.\" However, it's a word-for-word duplicate of other social media posts and texts that have been making the rounds, not a new \"scoop\" from an insider.\n\nThe claim appeared in a post (archived here) published on Facebook by Aaron Hawkins on March 19, 2020. It opened:\n\nHello family. Just got this from my contact at FEMA.\n\nPlease take heed...\n\nHomeland security is preparing to mobilize the national guard.\n\nPreparing to dispatch them across the US along with military. \n\nthey will also call in 1st responders.\n\nthey are preparing to announce a nationwide \n\n2 week quarantine for all citizens, \n\nAll businesses closed.\n\nEveryone at home.\n\nThey will announce this as soon as they have troops in place to help prevent looters and rioters...\n\nthey will announce before the end of the weekend,\n\nwithin 48 to 72 Hours the president will evoke what is called the \"Stafford Act\"\n\nThe president will order a two week mandatory quarantine for the nation.\n\nStock up on whatever you need to make sure you have a two week supply of everything.\n\nPlease forward to your family/friends.\n\nUsers on social media only saw this:\n\nThe post has received hundreds of shares and engagements, but it's not true. While some states, including Arizona and Oklahoma, have activated the National Guard to help combat the novel coronavirus, the Pentagon has said there are no plans to impose martial law. The federal government also said it's not calling up National Guard troops to impose a nationwide quarantine.\n\nGen. Joseph Lengyel, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, refuted the suggestion on Twitter:\n\nThe National Security Council also weighed in on the claims about a national quarantine:\n\nAccording to NPR, tens of thousands of members of the National Guard could be called up to help states combat the novel coronavirus in the coming weeks and months. However, the federal government denies that a national quarantine is in the offing, and posts like this are simply spreading disinformation.", "lang": "en"}
