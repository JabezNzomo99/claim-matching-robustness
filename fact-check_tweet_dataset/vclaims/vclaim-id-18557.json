That\u2019s wrong", "subtitle": "President Donald Trump might have stirred some confusion when he tweeted days after the fact about an attempted break-in", "author": "www.politifact.com", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-18557", "url": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/aug/02/chelsea-handler/chelsea-handler-blames-trumps-tweets-break-cumming/", "vclaim": "President Donald Trump might have stirred some confusion when he tweeted days after the fact about an attempted break-in at Rep. Elijah Cummings\u2019 Baltimore home.\n\n\"Really bad news! The Baltimore house of Elijah Cummings was robbed,\" Trump wrote. \"Too bad!\"\n\nWithout more context, Trump\u2019s tweet made the incident seem like breaking news. That could explain why some people have been pinning blame on the president, who spent the week attacking Cummings on Twitter over the condition of his Maryland district.\n\n\"Elijah Cummings\u2019 house was broken into after Trump publicly attacked him on Twitter and Republicans say nothing,\" comedian Chelsea Handler said in an Aug. 2 tweet that\u2019s amassed thousands of likes and retweets.\n\n\"Our president bullies someone and then has an intruder in his home,\" Handler wrote. \"The president of the United States. The lows keep coming.\"\n\nWe saw other similar reactions, but that\u2019s not what happened. According to Baltimore police, the attempted burglary took place roughly four hours before Trump\u2019s initial tweet-storm.\n\nCummings described the incident, which occurred early in the morning on July 27, in a statement to the Baltimore Sun.\n\n\"An individual attempted to gain entry into my residence at approximately 3:40 a.m. on Saturday, July 27,\" he said. \"I was notified of the intrusion by my security system, and I scared the intruder away by yelling before the person gained entry into the residential portion of the house.\"\n\nCummings\u2019 account matches what the Baltimore police department said in a statement and wrote in a police report, a copy of which we received.\n\nThe police report said no property was reported stolen, meaning Trump\u2019s tweet that Cummings\u2019 house was \"robbed\" was inaccurate.\n\nMore to the point, Trump\u2019s initial Twitter attacks \u2014 in which he called Cummings a \"brutal bully\" and described the congressman\u2019s district as \"a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess\" \u2014 also began on July 27. But the time-stamp for the president\u2019s first tweet is 7:14 a.m.\n\nAs of Aug. 2, police are still investigating the incident and it is not known if the break-in was politically motivated.\n\nHandler said, \"Elijah Cummings\u2019 house was broken into after Trump publicly attacked him on Twitter.\"\n\nAn intruder did attempt to enter Cummings\u2019 home, but that was almost four hours before Trump tweeted the first of several attacks on the congressman and his district.", "lang": "en"}
