People across the country took to the streets while the police in most states denied permission for protest and imposed Section 144. Among the protesters in Bengaluru, Karnataka was historian Ramachandra Guha who, with several others, was detained by the police. A video of the police detaining Guha is widely circulating on social media. However, some circulated it with the claim that a cop threatened to punch him.\n\nCongress MP Shashi Tharoor tweeted, \u201cIs this cop threatening to hit \u2066@Ram_Guha with his fist? \u201c\n\nIn fact, several other journalists claimed the same \u2013 Rituparna Chatterjee, Rupa Subramanya, Saikat Datta and Amol Rajan.\n\nDMK\u2019s IT-wing deputy secretary Isai tweeted, \u201cThe police in the right about to fist punch @Ram_Guha.\u201c\n\nAlt News analysed the viral video and found that the claim that a policeman threatened to punch historian Ramachandra Guha during anti-CAA protests is false. While it appears that the cop was making a fist when the video is watched at normal speed, a slowed-down version of the video reveals that he was reaching for the breast pocket on his uniform.\n\nThe clip below is 16x times slower than the original.\n\nFurthermore, a screengrab of the exact moment when the cop raises his arm clearly shows that he was touching his breast pocket. Here, we can also see that his fingers are not forming a fist.\n\nTherefore, while the video of policemen detaining Ramachandra Guha gives the visual perception that a cop made a fist at the moment of detaining him, in reality the policeman was reaching for the breast pocket on his uniform.", "lang": "en"}
