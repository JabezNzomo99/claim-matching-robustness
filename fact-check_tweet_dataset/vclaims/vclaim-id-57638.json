A Facebook user posted two such images along with the caption, \u201cPeople in Italy threw their wealth on the streets. They say it\u2019s of no use anymore.

On March 11, 2019, Twitter handle @, managed by Aurora Intel which tracks conflicts across the world, tweeted the viral images along with other photographs from the same area.\n\nA video package in Western Journal\u2019s report from March 13, 2019, also shows a tweet which includes these images. Additionally, the photographs were posted on the social media site Imgur on March 12.\n\nMaduradas, a Venezuela-based news website, had published an article on March 12 that complied images and tweets about the incident. This article included tweets by a Venezuelan politician William D\u00e1vila and Venezuela-based photojournalist Nellie Bel\u00e9n Izarza.\n\nD\u00e1vila\u2019s tweet also spoke about the robbery at Banco Bicentenario.\n\nAlt News performed a reverse image search and found that this image was posted on Imgur on March 17, 2019. According to these posts, this image is also from Venezuela. While Alt News could not authenticate the exact source, it is highly probable that it depicts the aftermath of the robbery at Merida because a) the image is similar and b) it surfaced on the internet around the same time.\n\nFormer Ambassador of Italy in Pakistan Stefano Pontecorvo called out a tweet which claimed that Italians threw currency notes in light of the coronavirus pandemic and growing loss of life.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the Venezuelan economy has spiralled into hyperinflation, starvation and unemployment due to a wide range of issues under the governance of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Ch\u00e1vez who died in 2013. A February 2019 BBC report states, \u201cAccording to a study by the opposition-controlled National Assembly, the annual inflation rate reached 1,300,000% in the 12 months to November 2018. By the end of last year, prices were doubling every 19 days on average. This has left many Venezuelans struggling to afford basic items such as food and toiletries.\u201d The unfavourable economic conditions have devalued the country\u2019s currency to the extent that money is regarded as worthless. In December 2019, Al Jazeera reported how some Venezuelans are making craft from devalued money to extract value from their decimated currency.\n\nWe compared the green coloured notes seen in the third image with the 50 Bol\u00edvar Fuerte and found them to be identical.\n\nThe Bol\u00edvar Fuerte is Venezuela\u2019s old currency which was replaced by the Bolivar Soberano in August 2018. By December 2018, all Bol\u00edvar Fuerte currency notes were withdrawn. The Bicentenario Bank was looted in March 2019 when the Bol\u00edvar Fuerte was worthless. This explains why the notes were discarded on the road. These photographs were earlier debunked by American fact-checking organisation Snopes.\n\nThus the social media claim that Italians, frustrated with the large number of deaths due to the coronavirus pandemic, threw their money on the road is false.", "lang": "en"}
