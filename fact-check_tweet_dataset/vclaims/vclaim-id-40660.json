I was in the Senate back in 2013 when an immigration bill passed, but it only had 54 votes, I think it was, and even though that\u2019s a majority, it wasn\u2019t enough to beat the filibuster.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic presidential contender is calling for major changes to the U.S. immigration system, including a pathway to citizenship \u201cfor the approximately 11 million undocumented individuals currently living and working in the United States.\u201d Warren also wants to end the legislative filibuster, saying \u201cit\u2019s been used by the far right as a tool to block progress on everything.\u201d\n\nThe filibuster was adopted in the early years of Congress, the theory being that lawmakers should be able to hold the floor and speak as long as necessary on any issue. The House chucked the filibuster as its membership grew. But it survives in the Senate, where a single member may block legislation unless it garners 60 votes.\n\nSupporters say the filibuster is a necessary check on legislative excess and ensures a voice for the minority party. Critics say the filibuster is regularly weaponized to thwart majority rule and major legislation such as the Civil Rights Act. (\u201cThe record for the longest individual speech goes to South Carolina\u2019s J. Strom Thurmond who filibustered for 24 hours and 18 minutes against the Civil Rights Act of 1957,\u201d according to the Senate Historical Office.)\n\nMonths after joining the Senate in 2013, Warren called for an end to the filibuster for presidential nominations because minority Republicans were using it to block President Barack Obama\u2019s court appointments. Democrats led by then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid of Nevada invoked the \u201cnuclear option\u201d and scrapped the filibuster for many nominations, except for the Supreme Court.\n\nThe last remnant is the legislative filibuster, and Warren wants it gone, too. Politico reported that \u201cwith Democrats like Warren talking about big ideas like the Green New Deal, Medicare-for-all and new tax plans, it\u2019s become more and more clear that a minority of GOP senators could stop them even if Democrats sweep the 2020 election.\u201d\n\nAmong its provisions, the bill would have created legal status for the estimated 11 million undocumented residents in the country, and included \u201cenormous investments in border security, including the following: deploying at least 38,405 full-time Border Patrol agents along the southern border (including an additional 19,200 more than currently in place); mandating an electronic exit system at all ports where Customs and Border Protection agents are deployed; constructing at least 700 miles of fencing, including double fencing; increasing mobile surveillance; deploying aircraft and radio communications; constructing additional Border Patrol stations and operating bases; hiring additional prosecutors, judges, and staff; providing additional training to border officers; and increasing prosecutions of illegal border crossings,\u201d according to the American Immigration Council. (Warren now supports decriminalizing border crossings.)\n\n\u201cElizabeth meant to reference the right-wing filibuster that rejected background checks in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre,\u201d Warren campaign spokeswoman Saloni Sharma said. \u201cElizabeth has been a leader in calling for an end to the filibuster and passing sweeping anti-corruption reforms so we can make real progress on issues the American people care about.\u201d\n\nThe 2013 effort to pass background-check legislation did receive 54 votes in the Senate, six short of a filibuster-proof majority. Warren has said its defeat is a prime example of why the filibuster needs to go.\n\nBut why would Warren pivot to gun control in the middle of extended answers about immigration? Did she really mean to do that, as her campaign said? Or did Warren simply get her wires crossed in two separate appearances? We couldn\u2019t get a straight answer from her campaign.\n\n\u201cHer answer is the same filibuster answer on how you get things done in Washington \u2014 the question is really about how can we get things passed in Congress; she reverted to her filibuster answer,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we see it.\u201d\n\nRegular readers know we sometimes withhold Pinocchios when a politician admits error, especially if it\u2019s a one-off statement. But the explanation must make sense. We\u2019re not convinced by the Warren campaign\u2019s seeming rationalization that she meant to talk about gun control in the middle of two extended answers about immigration.", "lang": "en"}
