Also, it is being claimed that the photo was taken during the freedom struggle and that the other person in the photo is Muhammed Ali Jinnah. FACTLY has found that the woman kissing Nehru in the photo is his niece Nayantara Sehgal. Also, Muhammed Ali Jinnah is not present in the photo. The photo was clicked when Nehru landed at the London Airport in 1955 but Jinnah died in 1948. In a video taken during that visit, the visual in the photo can be seen at 0:27 secs. The same photo was also previously fact-checked by FACTLY (in 2019).\n\n\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
