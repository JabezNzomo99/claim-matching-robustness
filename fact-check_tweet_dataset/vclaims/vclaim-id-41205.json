This post has been shared over 1,200 times on Facebook. You can access the archived version here.\n\nThe video has been viral for two years now. BOOM had debunked the same video in 2017. None of the video\u2019s previous descriptions refer to the woman as Hiraben Modi nor does the woman bear any resemblance to the prime minister\u2019s mother.
