(RELATED: Does COVID-19 Translate To \u2018See A Sheep Surrender\u2019 In An Ancient Language?)\n\nThis particular Facebook post claims a COVID-19 mobile testing truck bears the symbol of Anubis, the jackal-headed Egyptian god associated with mummification and the afterlife. The caption reads, \u201cAnubis, Egyptian God of the DEAD, on CV19 testing trucks!!!!!!\u201d\n\nThe pictured truck belongs to the Pennsylvania-based company Aardvark Mobile Tours, according to media reports. The company converted some of its \u201cpatented trucks\u201d into mobile COVID-19 testing facilities, per the Philadelphia Business Journal. As the company\u2019s name suggests, the logo features the head of an aardvark, not Anubis.\n\nHeather Gries, an account executive at Brian Communications, which represents Aardvark Mobile Tours, confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller that the logo shows an aardvark.\n\n\u201cThe logo for Aardvark Mobile Tours was created in 2007 and includes the Aardvark head \u2013 which is what you see in the COVID-19 testing logo,\u201d she said.\n\nAardvarks are insect-eating animals native to sub-Saharan Africa, according to National Geographic. In Egyptian mythology, the aadvark \u2013 as well as animals such as the antelope, greyhound and fennec fox \u2013 have been suggested as the basis for the form of Seth, the Egyptian god associated with the desert, chaos, storms and war, per Encyclopedia Britannica.\n\n\u201cLarry Borden, the founder and CEO, actually chose the name Aardvark originally because of the double \u2018A\u2019 at the beginning, meaning the company would show up at the beginning of the phone book,\u201d Gries said.", "lang": "en"}
