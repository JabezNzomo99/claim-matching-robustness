General Assembly. They sat in seats reserved for guests of the speaker, President Donald Trump.\n\nA falsehood on social media accuses President Donald Trump\u2019s grown children of occupying seats at the United Nations headquarters in New York City that were intended for guests with disabilities.\n\nThat deception \u2014 based on social media speculation \u2014 followed Trump\u2019s address before the U.N. General Assembly on Sept. 24, and appears in stories and screenshots that have been shared by thousands of users.\n\nPoliticalFlare.com, which describes itself as a \u201cnews/opinion site for Democrats,\u201d posted a story featuring an Associated Press image showing a disability placard in front of the Trumps. The story focuses on social media commentary about that picture, but its headline reads as fact: \u201cTrump\u2019s Children Cause Outrage at UN After Seen Sitting in Area Reserved for the Handicapped.\u201d\n\nLikewise, the website DCTribune.org posted a headline claiming, \u201cTrump\u2019s Children Cause Anger At UN Assembly After Photo Emerges Of Them Sitting In Area Reserved For The Handicapped.\u201d Its subhead called the matter \u201csickening.\u201d Other websites also perpetuated the falsehood.\n\nBut the Trumps were actually sitting in an area that was reserved for them.\n\nSt\u00e9phane Dujarric, a spokesman for the UN secretary-general, told us by phone that the area in question seats 21 people and is \u201creserved for guests of the speaker\u201d \u2014 in this case, Trump. \u201cEvery head of state can have guests,\u201d he explained.\n\nDujarric said two seats in the area can be adjusted to make room for wheelchairs \u2014 hence the handicapped placard \u2014 but in this case they were not needed. Other images show various Trump administration officials sitting in the rows behind members of the Trump family.\n\n\u201cEverybody sat where they were supposed to sit,\u201d Dujarric said. \u201cNobody was sitting in an area where they shouldn\u2019t have been sitting.\u201d\n\nLinks to the stories on PoliticalFlare.com and DCTribune.org alone earned more than 120,000 Facebook engagements, including some 23,000 shares, according to CrowdTangle data. The PoliticalFlare.com post was updated to include language midway through the story that indicates some uncertainty about the claim. The headline of its story, though, remains false.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media. Our previous stories can be found here.\n\nUpdate, Nov. 18: One of the websites that ran a story advancing the false claim that the Trump family sat in the seats for the disabled at the U.N. changed its headline and amended its story to reflect that the claim was wrong. DCTribune.org \u2013 now PoliticalTribune.org \u2013 also added a correction that says the section \u201cwas not reserved exclusively for disabled or differently-abled people.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
