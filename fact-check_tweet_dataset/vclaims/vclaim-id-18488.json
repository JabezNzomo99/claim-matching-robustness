The department of Basic Education (DBE) already denied the story and other \u201cridiculous\u201d false reports in 2017.\n\nThe screenshot can be seen on a Facebook post, which received hundreds of shares and is archived here, captioned: \u201cSums up everything g that is wrong with this God forsaken place..\u201d\n\nAnother post this month shared the claim here. Claims from 2017 can be found here and here.\n\nThe claims were attributed to Angie Motshekga, minister of basic (primary and lower secondary) education.
