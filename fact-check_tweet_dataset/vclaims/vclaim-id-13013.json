{"title": "Post-Brexit trade tariffs", "subtitle": "We have a voluntary choice about import tariffs, but not the tariffs on our exports.", "author": "fullfact.org", "date": null, "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-13013", "url": "https://fullfact.org/economy/post-brexit-trade-tariffs/", "vclaim": "It\u2019s correct that the UK would be able to choose what tariffs it put on imports from other countries, after it left the EU customs union.\n\nThe UK wouldn\u2019t have a completely free hand to do this. It would have to apply the same rates to all other WTO members, except where it has a free trade agreement or is giving preferences to developing countries.\n\nIt would also have to keep those tariffs within limits agreed in the World Trade Organisation (WTO).\n\nAnd we wouldn\u2019t have a choice about what tariffs were put on our exports.\n\nMr Rees-Mogg went some way to making the same point about exports when he added:\n\n\u201cWe would be in a very strong position to retaliate if vicious tariffs were imposed on us.\u201d\n\nWhether or not we\u2019d be in a \u201cstrong position\u201d to respond is a more complicated and speculative question than we can confirm or deny in a factcheck.\n\nWe can say that any tariffs would have to conform with limits agreed in the World Trade Organisation, and also that other countries wouldn\u2019t be able to pick on the UK and impose specific tariffs on UK-made goods or services (or vice versa).\n\nThe UK will still be a member of the WTO after it leaves the EU (there will be negotiations about the details of the UK\u2019s membership status outside the EU, although there\u2019s some debate about how difficult these will be). Members of the WTO have to put the same tariffs on every trading partner worldwide, unless they are part of a customs union or have some kind of free trade agreement.\n\nThe EU customs union is one such agreement. That\u2019s why there\u2019s often disagreement about whether to think of the EU as essentially pro-free trade or protectionist. It removes tariff barriers between its members, negotiates Free Trade deals on behalf of all of them, and imposes a Common External Tariff on anyone it doesn't have a trade deal with.\n\nThe EU also tries to eliminate other barriers to free trade among its members, like non-tariff barriers, and there\u2019s a question about whether the UK will have the same influence over these things once it leaves the customs union.\n\nNon-tariff barriers include things like common safety standards and professional regulations. Businesses find it harder to sell goods and services in other countries if they aren\u2019t the same.", "lang": "en"}
