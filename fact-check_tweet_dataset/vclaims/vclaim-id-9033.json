However, the graphic was actually created for a Cracked digital manipulation contest titled \u201cIll-Advised First Drafts of Great Ad Campaigns,\u201d in which entrants were challenged to come up with fictional representations of \u201crejected ideas that led to great ads\u201d:\n\nWe all love to make fun of ad campaigns. After all, \u201cJust do it\u201d could also be a phrase that means that you should have sex with someone, and that is objectively hilarious. But it takes a great deal of thought and rejected ideas to arrive at the campaigns we see on TV. We asked you to show us some of the rejected ideas that led to great ads using the magic of image manipulation.\n\n\n\nThe underlying image for this entry was taken from a real Budweiser advertisement created in 1957 as part of the brewer\u2019s long-running \u201cwhere there\u2019s life \u2026 there\u2019s Bud\u201d campaign:\n\nSome language and attitudes expressed in decades-past advertising campaigns can be jarring to modern sensibilities, but this particular ad never actually existed.", "lang": "en"}
