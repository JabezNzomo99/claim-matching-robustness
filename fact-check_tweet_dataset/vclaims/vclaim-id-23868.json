The detailed description put in the post is \u2013 \u201895,300 names of Freedom Fighters are inscribed at India Gate, New Delhi. From above, a list of religion and caste-based total is given as: Muslims-61,395 ; Sikh-8,050 ; Hindus(Backward) ; Hindus(Dalits) \u2013 10,777 ; Hindus(High Cast)- 598; Hindus(sanghi fro RSS). Indian freedom struggle is written with Muslim blood.\u2019 Let\u2019s try to verify the claims made in the post.\n\nClaim: India Gate has the names of the freedom fighters inscribed on it. Fact: The India Gate commemorates the Indian soldiers who lost their lives fighting for the British Army during World War I. The memorial bears the names of the British and Indian soldiers killed in the Northwestern Frontier in the Afghan war of 1919. There is no mention of the religion or the caste of these dead soldiers. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen we tried to verify the above claim, a search with the keywords \u201cIndia gate new delhi background\u201d resulted in a number of search results. Among them, the link of \u2018Delhi Tourism\u2019 website that describes the details of the India Gate monument can be found. In this webpage, it is mentioned about India Gate as- \u201cIt(India Gate) commemorates the 70,000 Indian soldiers who lost their lives fighting for the British Army during World War I. The memorial bears the names of more than 13,516 British and Indian soldiers killed in the Northwestern Frontier in the Afghan war of 1919\u201d. So, India Gate has the names of the British and Indian soldiers killed in the Northwestern Frontier in the Afghan war of 1919 and not the names of freedom fighters as described in the post.\n\nDuring the search process, it was found that the database of the names of all the soldiers inscribed on the India Gate is held by the \u2018Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC)\u2019. When searched on their website, the database which was found can be seen here. In this list, the details such as the soldier\u2019s name, rank, service number, date of death, age, grave service number and regiment country of service can be seen but there is no mention of his/her religion or caste.\n\nIn the \u2018about\u2019 section of their website, it was found that CWGC does not discriminate the dead soldiers on ground of their military rank, race or creed.\n\nTo summarise, India Gate does not have the names of \u2018Freedom Fighters\u2019 inscribed on it.\n\nDid you watch our new Episode of the DECODE series on Parliament?", "lang": "en"}
