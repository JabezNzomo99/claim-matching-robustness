To prevent a Turkish invasion, the United States persuaded the SDF to pull back up to nine miles from the Turkish border. In August, the SDF destroyed its own military posts after assurances the United States would not let thousands of Turkish troops invade. But then Trump tossed that aside.\n\nTrump frequently and misleadingly frames this as a \u201ccenturies\u201d-long conflict between the Turks and the Kurds. There has been a hundred-year effort to create a Kurdish state in the aftermath of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, with the Kurds frequently manipulated by great powers seeking to flex their muscles against a particular nation, such as Iraq. The Kurds were promised a country in the 1920 Treaty of S\u00e9vres, which broke up the Ottoman Empire, but that promise was abandoned in the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne after the new Turkish government rejected the terms of the previous treaty.\n\nThis is a made-up \u201cfact.\u201d In October 2015 \u2014 four years ago \u2014 President Barack Obama deployed a small number of troops to advise and assist local forces fighting against the Islamic State. Then-White House spokesman Josh Ernest said the initial deployment would be small, \u201cless than 50.\u201d He said \u201cthey will not have a combat mission,\u201d which they never have. Troops were added, but no official said anything even remotely about 30 days or any timetable at all.\n\n\u201cThe last administration said [Syrian President Bashar] Assad must go. They could have easily produced that outcome, but they didn\u2019t. In fact, they drew a very powerful red line in the sand \u2014 you all remember the red line in the sand \u2014 when children were gassed and killed, but then did not honor their commitment, as other children died in the same horrible manner. But I did honor my commitments with 58 Tomahawks.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d statement was one the low points of his presidency. (We detailed the ad hoc fashion in which he adopted it in this 2013 fact check.) After Obama decided not to attack Syria over its chemical weapons use, he instead decided to negotiate a deal under which the Syrian government would give up its chemical weapons stockpile. The Obama White House touted that as a great achievement, but later it emerged that Syria did not declare all of its stocks and still attacked citizens with chemical weapons not covered by the 2013 agreement.", "lang": "en"}
