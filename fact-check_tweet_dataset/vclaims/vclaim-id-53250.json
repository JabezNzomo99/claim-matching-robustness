The claim is false; the video has previously circulated in reports about a collection of Korans which survived a fire at a Saudi Airlines office in Dhaka, Bangladesh in October 2019; a journalist in AFP's Dhaka bureau said a woman could be heard speaking about the fire in Bengali in the video; local media reports stated a fire gutted the Saudi Airlines office in Dhaka on October 1, 2019.\n\nThe one-minute, 30-second clip was published here on Facebook on October 9, 2019. It has been viewed more than 16,000 times and shared more than 430 times.\n\nThe post's Indonesian-language caption translates to English as: \u201cForeign (French) media covering the remains of a burnt down mosque in Wamena, Mashallah.. the Koran remains intact not burned....\n\nBelow is the screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nWamena is a town in Indonesia\u2019s Papua province that has experienced one of the worst clashes since violence broke out in the Papua region in August 2019. AFP reports on the unrest can be read here and here.\n\n\u201cMashallah\u201d is an Arabic phrase which means this is what God wills. It is also used to express praise.\n\nThe same video was also viewed thousands of times after it was published on Facebook here, here, here and here, with a similar claim.\n\nThe claim is false; the video has previously circulated in reports about a collection of Korans which survived a fire at a Saudi Airlines office in Bangladesh in October 2019.\n\nA Google keyword search found this one-minute, 30-second video published on YouTube on October 7, 2019, which shows identical scenes as the clip in the misleading post.\n\nThe YouTube video's Urdu-language title translates to English as: \u201cSaudi Airlines office in Dhaka, Bangladesh, caught fire, but the Koran Majid,\u201d suggesting that a copy of the Koran was safe although a fire engulfed the Saudi Airlines office.\n\nThe video's English-language caption states: \u201cThat\u2019s the Saudi airlines office at Dhaka yesterday. Amazing that all Quran are intact. Allahu Akbar.\u201d\n\nA woman\u2019s voice could be heard speaking in Bengali throughout the video. According to a journalist at AFP\u2019s Dhaka bureau, she said:\n\n \u201cThe miracle thing is the Korans didn\u2019t burn. See all the Korans are intact. Everything else is burnt, praise to Allah! See Nazir? Not a single Koran got burnt. Praise to Allah! Amazing huh! See all Korans are as they are! Even the packages are burnt but not the Koran! Did you see? I am feeling goosebumps!\u201d\n\nBelow is a comparison screenshot of the video in the misleading post (L) and the earlier YouTube video (R):\n\nThe incident happened on October 1, 2019, as reported by the Dhaka Tribune here and United News of Bangladesh here on the same day.\n\nThe Dhaka Tribune\u2019s report is headlined: \u201cFire at Sonargaon hotel doused.\u201d\n\nThe report's first three paragraphs state: \u201cSaudi Airlines office completely burnt, Pubali Bank branch damaged.\n\n\u201cThe fire, which broke out at the Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel in Dhaka, has been doused.\n\n\u201cThe fire broke out around 2:40 am on Tuesday.\u201d\n\nSaudi Airlines' Dhaka office was located inside the Pan Pacific Sonargaon hotel according to its official website here.\n\nPhotos showing the outside of the Saudi Airlines office in Dhaka tagged on Google Street View here and here correspond with the video in the misleading posts.", "lang": "en"}
