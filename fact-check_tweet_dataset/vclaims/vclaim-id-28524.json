Many outside experts say that Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was highly unusual. Trump appeared to have no agenda except to ask for the Ukrainian government to work with his private attorney to investigate a potential 2020 presidential rival and also investigate debunked conspiracy theories about possible interference by Ukraine in the 2016 election. Trump made about eight requests for help with some sort of investigation involving either former vice president Joe Biden or the Democrats.\n\nThe prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, let that investigation and others go dormant, and the United States and its allies decided he was not effective in his job and in fact let corruption flourish. Biden traveled to Ukraine in December 2015 and said the United States would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees unless Shokin was removed; it was not a demand to stop the Burisma prosecution, and there\u2019s no evidence of Shokin\u2019s \u201cdigging\u201d into Burisma \u2014 nor is there any evidence Hunter Biden was ever under investigation.\n\nThe vice president\u2019s trip was part of a longer push by the United States, Western allies and nongovernmental organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. The goal was to promote reform in Ukraine and remove a prosecutor who allegedly was turning a blind eye to corruption. The U.S. plan to push for Shokin\u2019s dismissal didn\u2019t initially come from Biden but rather filtered up from officials at the State Department. Shokin was eventually removed by parliament. The prosecutor general of Ukraine in early 2019, Yuriy Lutsenko, was quoted as saying \u201che had no evidence of wrongdoing by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden or his son.\u201d\n\nZelensky also questioned Trump\u2019s decision to freeze military aid, casting it as a matter of \u201cfairness.\u201d Here are Zelensky\u2019s full comments on a potential quid pro quo: \u201cI never talked to the President from the position of a quid pro quo. That\u2019s not my thing. \u2026 I don\u2019t want us to look like beggars. But you have to understand. We\u2019re at war. If you\u2019re our strategic partner, then you can\u2019t go blocking anything for us. I think that\u2019s just about fairness. It\u2019s not about a quid pro quo. It just goes without saying.\u201d\n\nSondland said he later came to believe that $400 million of military aid to Ukraine was also contingent on an announcement of the investigations. But Trump is quoting from a phone conversation that Sondland said he had with Trump on Sept. 9, after Congress announced an investigation into the holdup of aid to Ukraine. Sondland testified that he did not know whether Trump was telling the truth, at least about the funding portion of the quid pro quo.", "lang": "en"}
