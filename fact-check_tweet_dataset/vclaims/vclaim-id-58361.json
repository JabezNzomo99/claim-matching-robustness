That is a 15 year old girl with whom he\u2019s making out!!!\"\n\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe photo shows the former vice president kissing his granddaughter on the lips during a campaign rally in Iowa on Feb. 2. Biden was 77 years old when the photo was taken, not 76. His granddaughter, Finnegan Biden, was 19, not 15.\n\n\"Granddaughters not only love their grandpops, but they like him,\" Joe Biden said at the rally before kissing her. \"And that\u2019s the great thing. Thank you, baby.\"\n\nOnline, reactions ranged from people saying they were creeped out to others who chastised those who think a kiss between grandfather and grandchild is inappropriate.\n\nEither way, this Facebook post is misleading. Not only does it give the wrong ages for both Bidens, but it also gives the impression that Biden is making out with an underage girl. That\u2019s not what\u2019s happening in this photo.", "lang": "en"}
