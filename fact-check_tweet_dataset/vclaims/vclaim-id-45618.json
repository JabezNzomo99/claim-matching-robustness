The claim is consistent with the negative spin Russian media and officials historically have applied when civil crises erupt in the U.S.", "author": "www.polygraph.info", "date": "June 04, 2020", "vclaim_id": "vclaim-id-45618", "url": "https://www.polygraph.info/a/russia-george-floyd-protests/30653379.html", "vclaim": "\u201cFriendly advice to the negroes of Minnesota and the U.S.A. from a journalist,\u201d the Telegram post on May 30 reads in Russian.\n\nShared over 53,000 times, the post is a sarcastic 13-point \u201cplan\u201d on how to run a \u201cMaidan-type\u201d revolution \u2013 a reference to the 2014 protests and unrest that forced a change in Ukraine\u2019s government.\n\nThe post uses racially disparaging language, and to \u201cignite\u201d a revolution it recommends staging a 3D video-recorded police beating with \u201cbrains and blood flying around\u201d in the best practices of Leni Riefenstahl (Adolf Hitler\u2019s propaganda film director).\n\nThe victims have to be \u201cgentle creatures, not ripped criminal negrillos,\u201d the post says, because no one cares about the latter, even those people \u201ccrowing like roosters\u201d about their rights.\n\nThe post goes on to suggest setting up a stage where \u201cnegroes\u2019 folk dance twerk\u201d would be performed 24/7 and assigning \u201cblack bros\u201d to cook amphetamine and meth. The last sentence reads: \u201cBeat whites until they turn black!\u201d\n\nThe text was reposted on the Telegram by Margarita Simonyan, the editor-in-chief of RT (state-owned news outlet Russia Today) and published in a more polished form (although still containing racial language) in one of Russia\u2019s most popular newspapers.\n\nThe author of the post is Dmitry Steshin, special political correspondent for Komsomolskaya Pravda (KP), a national tabloid. It appeared in the paper\u2019s \u201cWorld politics\u201d section.\n\nKP distributes more copies than any other newspaper in Russia \u2013 about 40 million monthly - and its website has 20 million visits a month.\n\nSince the protests over Floyd\u2019s death in police custody began in the U.S. on May 25, Komsomolskaya Pravda has run a series of reports from different American cities. Each has cited a local resident, an eyewitness who happens to be a \u201cRussian girl\u201d asking to remain anonymous.\n\nThe life stories of these girls are slightly different, though oddly they all came to the U.S. from Siberia. At first glance, their accounts of U.S. events seem fairly credible, but there are distortions.\n\nA June 1 KP story about Minneapolis, which described the city \u201cdrowning in hatred,\u201d quoted a \u201cRussian girl\u201d describing chaos and peoples\u2019 fear of being \u201cabandoned by the police\u201d and left to the mercy of violent protesters.\n\n\"In the news, they are now are talking about the first people killed and even raped in Minneapolis,\u201d she is quoted as saying.\n\nWhile violence, injuries, looting and damaged property have been widely reported, VOA was unable to find any media or law enforcement reports of protest-related rapes in Minnesota.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, at least 11 people have been killed nationwide during the protests, with three cases directly linked to the unrest and others still under investigation, including the one in Minneapolis. (The news report about Minneapolis death came out on June 2 \u2013 a day after KP piece was published.)\n\nThe same KP story reported that \u201cwalking to the vigil people created at the site of George Floyd\u2019s death is prohibited after the Pentagon brought the troops in.\u201d\n\nThat is also false. On May 28, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz declared a state of peacetime emergency and activated the National Guard, but no troops were brought in from out of state. The nighttime curfew which Waltz ordered the following day only prohibited outdoor activities from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m.\n\nThe site of George Floyd\u2019s death is open to the public and has become a place for people to gather and share their grief.\n\nMargarita Simonyan is the chief editor of the Russian government\u2019s multimillion-dollar media conglomerate MIA Rossiya Segodnya, which includes RT and Sputnik. She did not explain why she shared Steshin\u2019s Telegram post.\n\nWhen Simonyan\u2019s re-post came under scrutiny from Bellingcat, an investigative website, RT\u2019s Twitter account tweeted that many in Russia are ignorant of the racist connotation the label \u201cnegro\u201d has for some in the U.S.\n\nSimonyan lived and studied in the U.S. during her senior year of high school. She has previously used the word \u201cnegro/s\u201d.\n\nAnother prominent Russian capitalizing on the U.S. unrest is Ramzan Kadyrov, the governor of Chechnya, who has been repeatedly criticized by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the U.S. government for a range of civil rights violations and attacks on journalists.\n\n\u201cWith horror I am watching the situation in the U.S., where the rights of common citizens have been brutally violated by the authorities,\u201d Kadyrov wrote in a statement published on the website of Ekho Mosvky (Echo of Moscow) radio station.\n\nIn the United States, various commentators took note of the irony in Russia\u2019s response to the Floyd protests.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s heartbreak brought considerable joy to Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, but the gloating also exposes the deep ugliness of his regime,\u201d U.S. analyst Julia Davis wrote in a Daily Beast piece about Russian media coverage.\n\nIran and China also accused the U.S. government of hypocrisy and cited the events to defend their own controversial policies, such as China\u2019s crackdown on the Hong Kong protests, which politicians, the State Department and others have criticized.\n\n\u201cThe whole world has watched as things unravel in the U.S.,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Monday, according to the Washington Examiner. \u201cAmerican politicians had better get their own house in order.\u201d\n\nZhao\u2019s comment came just ahead of the June 4 anniversary of the Chinese government\u2019s violent suppression of protests in Tianamen Square in 1989. Hundreds are believed to have been killed.\n\nThe network analysis firm Graphika issued a report Wednesday that used artificial intelligence to review social media traffic. The report cited a graphic posted by Russia\u2019s Sputnik outlet stating: \u201cAmerica 2020: Where anti-racists are terrorists and racists are president.\u201d\n\nAccording to NBC, the Graphika analysis did not find evidence of a covert Russian campaign to influence the protests.\n\nRussia\u2019s response to the Floyd protests has historic precedent.\n\nJelani Cobb, a Columbia Journalism School professor, wrote an article published in The New Yorker magazine in 2018 headlined, \u201cThe Enduring Russian Propaganda Interests in Targeting African-Americans.\" Cobb was writing in the context of Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 U.S. election in an effort to help Trump win.\n\n\"During the Cold War, Soviet school curricula highlighted the exploitation of black people as a prime example of both American hypocrisy and of the rapacious nature of the capitalist system,\u201d Cobb wrote. \u201cCommunist publications in the United States hired black writers and advocated for racial equality. That propaganda tradition of the old Soviet Union came back into view with Vladimir Putin, former KGB agent.\"\n\nA study of social media posts conducted for the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence found that prior to 2016, Russian state-backed internet operatives \u201ccreated an expansive cross-platform media mirage targeting the Black community, which shared and cross-promoted authentic Black media to create an immersive influence ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThat included posting thousands of YouTube videos relating to Black Lives Matter and police violence and maintaining 30 Facebook pages directed at African Americans that attracted more than 1 million followers.\n\nAt the same time, Russian operatives created anti-Black Lives Matter accounts on social media, purchasing ads and promoting white supremacist ideology, The Washington Post reported.\n\nIn a blog post summarizing its study, Graphika noted that Russian media and media posts about the Floyd protests attacked Human Rights Watch, falsely accused former President Barack Obama of inciting violence, called Trump a \u201ccoward\u201d and condemned attacks by police on journalists covering the demonstrations.\n\n\u201cOverall, however, the Russian coverage and commentary on the U.S. protests focused more on the nationwide unrest and the authorities\u2019 response, in line with earlier practice of reporting on genuine grievances in the West and letting the events speak for themselves,\u201d Graphika said.", "lang": "en"}
