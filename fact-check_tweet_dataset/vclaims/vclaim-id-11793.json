Since then, the post has been shared 11 times to different Facebook pages and groups. All of these accounted for a combined total of at least 15,000 interactions. The page and groups used to circulate this claim have a total of two million followers.\n\n\"The return of the bells [was] upon the demand of the Filipino people,\" Duterte said on December 13. He also said that \"nobody but nobody\" should take credit for the successful return of the Balangiga Bells.\n\nEarlier, Malaca\u00f1ang Palace said on December 11 that it was President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s political will that made the return of the bells possible. Former Special Presidential Assistant Christopher \u201cBong\u201d Go also said it was Duterte\u2019s effort, but \u201che is not taking credit for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a number of presidents, a number of secretaries [of Defense], a number of US and Philippine ambassadors who worked for the return of the Balangiga bells. It was decades worth of work and protest from the veterans, and the legal issues that came with it,\u201d said Koscina.\n\n\n\nAccording to his profile page on the website of ASPI, Russel (not Russell as the blog and Facebook post spelled it) is currently the vice president for international security and diplomacy of ASPI. He was Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs in the US Department of State from July 2013 to March 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, the posts on insiderph.com and bayangpilipinas.com (which cites the former blog as its source) copied most of their text content from a December 11 ABS-CBN News report without acknowledgment or citation. The last two paragraphs, which were not in the ABS-CBN News report, read:\n\nThe photo used by the posts come from a different context, far from the return of the Balangiga bells. The first photo is a flipped photo of Russel speaking in the Foreign Press Center in Washington on February 4, 2014. The second one is him in a media interview at the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs on October 24, 2016.", "lang": "en"}
