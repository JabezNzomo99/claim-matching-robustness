Rep. Donna Edwards, D-Md., said on Fox News Sunday that investing in schools is an obvious step.\n\n\"It\u2019s not a matter of money,\" Wallace said on May 3, 2015. \"One of the things that we learned this week is Baltimore spends the third-highest per capita on its public schools. Baltimore was already spending plenty on public schools, and the schools were still lousy.\"\n\nTo get to \"third-highest,\" Wallace is counting only the 100 largest school districts -- and lopping off more affluent communities in the process.\n\nFox News told us that Wallace relied on a Census Bureau release that compared the nationwide. (Wallace misspoke slightly. He should have said per-pupil spending, not per capita.) Among the 100 largest districts, Baltimore does spend more per pupil than all-but two other districts:\n\nThe problem is there are more than 15,000 school districts across the country, and there are hundreds that spend more. Among school districts with at least 5,000 students, Baltimore ranks 160th in spending. Or to give another example, Baltimore ranks 20th among the 500 largest school districts:\n\nWallace simplified a complex problem when he said improving Baltimore\u2019s schools \"is not about money.\" There are studies on both sides of that debate.\n\nTo pick one that supports Wallace\u2019s view, researchers looked at four years of data on Pennsylvania schools . In 2010, the 21st Century Partnership for STEM Education in Philadelphia compared spending in nearly 500 school districts to 11th grade test results. The strongest predictor of high scores was the fraction of adults in the district with a four-year college degree. F. Joseph Merlino is the organization\u2019s president.\n\n\"You would think that spending more money would lead to better outcomes,\" Merlino said. \"But the results are very weak.\"\n\nThe report said \"Spending per pupil, regardless of expenditure category, had either no association with student achievement or at best only a weak positive or a weak negative correlation with student achievement. \"\n\nOn the other hand, professors at Northwestern University and the University of California-Berkeley looked at where spending increased under court order. In a report published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, they said that for low income children who spent all 12 years in schools where spending rose at least 20 percent, graduation rates rose by 23 percentage points.\n\nThere were also \"25 percent higher earnings, and a 20 percentage-point reduction in the annual incidence of adult poverty.\" At the same time, increased spending had little impact on the education of children from families making more money.\n\nWallace said that Baltimore ranks third in per capita school spending.\n\nThat's only true if you look at the 100 largest school districts. Among the top 500, Baltimore ranks 20th. Among school districts with at least 5,000 students, Baltimore ranks 160th in spending.\n\nWallace's claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.", "lang": "en"}
