Some verified Twitter handles have also posted the same.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. This set of 11 commemorative postage stamps on Ramayana was released by PM Modi in Varanasi in 2017.\n\nSeveral users on Facebook and Twitter users have shared the post.\n\nUsing a combination of reverse image search and keyword search, we found a tweet from a handle called \u201c@BetterPhilately\u201d, posted on September 23, 2017.\n\nThe Twitter user posted a set of three pictures, one of which shows PM Modi and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath holding stamp books. The caption said India Post has issued stamps in two mini-sheets on the Ramayana in Varanasi. The same set of Ramayana stamps that has gone viral now was tweeted by the user.\n\nTaking a clue from this, we searched and found news reports related to the event.\n\nAccording to a report published in \u201cNDTV\u201d on September 22, 2017, PM Modi released a postage stamp on the different aspects of Lord Rama\u2019s life at the historic Tulsi Manas mandir in Varanasi. This was also tweeted by PM Modi on the same day.\n\nWe found that the website of \u201cIndia Postage Stamps\u201d had released these stamps on the same day, i.e. September 22, 2017.\n\nHence, it is clear that the viral post claiming that PM Modi released the Ramayana stamps recently is misleading. These stamps were released three years ago.\n\nAlso read: Fact Check: Weaver\u2019s suicide wrongly linked to PM Modi and his constituency", "lang": "en"}
