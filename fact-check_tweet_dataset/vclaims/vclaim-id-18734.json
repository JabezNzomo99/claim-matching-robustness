It didn\u2019t project job increases on a yearly basis, an ITC spokeswoman told us.\n\nKudlow made the claim during a \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d interview on Aug. 18. When asked about reports that the U.S. may soon experience an economic recession, Kudlow responded in part by saying that the USMCA trade deal \u2014 which has not been approved by Congress \u2014 would help the economy by increasing gross domestic product and employment.\n\n\u201cWe are looking at the USMCA, NAFTA 2.0 trade deal,\u201d said Kudlow, who has been director of the U.S. National Economic Council since early 2018. \u201cThat would be very important and would add a half a point of GDP and 180,000 new jobs per year if we get that through.\u201d\n\nHe has made the claim before, too.\n\nIn a July Fox News Radio interview, Kudlow called the USMCA a \u201chuge growth contributor\u201d that is \u201cestimated to add \u2026 something like 180,000 jobs per year.\u201d\n\nWe asked, but the White House did not provide any support for his claim.\n\nAs we said, Kudlow may have been thinking of the ITC\u2019s report assessing the \u201clikely impact\u201d of the USMCA \u201con the U.S. economy as a whole and on specific industry sectors.\u201d The independent commission\u2019s model estimated the trade agreement \u201cwould raise U.S. real GDP by $68.2 billion (0.35 percent) and U.S. employment by 176,000 jobs (0.12 percent),\u201d according to the report.\n\nBut those are not \u201cper year\u201d figures. The report said those are estimates of job growth and GDP six years from whenever the deal may be implemented.\n\nPage 43 of the report says:\n\nU.S. International Trade Commission report, April 2019: The economy-wide model estimates the U.S. economy\u2019s complete adjustment to the full implementation of USMCA, which is assumed to be year 6 after USMCA enters into force. Therefore, the estimates show the impact of the modeled provisions after the economy has responded to the changes in USMCA. The estimates show the incremental effects of USMCA relative to a baseline that reflects the U.S. economy in 2017 and assumes that no other changes to the economy unfold.\n\nWe confirmed that with an ITC spokeswoman.\n\n\u201cThe analysis did not look at job gains on a year by year basis \u2013 it only estimated the increase in jobs in year 6 relative to the baseline,\u201d she wrote in an email.\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear how those 176,000 estimated future jobs could help during a recession that many economists believe could hit the U.S. in 2020 or 2021.\n\nIn fact, the ITC report said the trade agreement\u2019s overall impact on the U.S. economy is likely to be \u201cpositive\u201d but \u201cmoderate.\u201d\n\nA Congressional Research Service report issued in February said other analysts view the potential impact similarly.\n\n\u201cIf the USMCA is approved by Congress and it enters into force, many economists and other observers believe that it is not expected to have a measurable effect on U.S. trade and investment with other NAFTA parties, jobs, wages, or overall economic growth, and that it would probably not have a measurable effect on the U.S. trade deficit,\u201d CRS said.", "lang": "en"}
