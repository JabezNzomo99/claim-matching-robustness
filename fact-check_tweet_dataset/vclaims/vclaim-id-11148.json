But that proportion has risen since 2012, albeit from a low figure.\n\nThe government has said that it realises the data will not properly reflect the reality felt by schools, according to the National Audit Office. One reason for that is that the statistics are gathered in November, when vacancies are low compared to the rest of the academic year.\n\nThe vacancy rate is low, but has been rising\n\nThere were around 1,000 vacancies for full-time permanent teachers in English state-funded schools in 2014. That\u2019s 0.3% of all regular full-time qualified teachers, so according to this data it\u2019s still relatively low.\n\nBut the number has been rising. The number has risen from around 400 in each of the three years from 2010 to 2012, when the rate stayed at 0.1%.\n\nThese are teaching posts that are either empty or have been filled by a temporary teacher on a contract of less than one term.\n\nAs the government spokesperson says, the rate hasn\u2019t gone above 1% since at least 2000, which is as far back as the statistics go.\n\nThe figures for 2000-2010 are slightly different to the figures for 2010 and beyond. They show vacancies in local authority schools, whereas the newer figures here look at all state-funded schools including academies. And the vacancies were counted at a different time of year.\n\nThe number of posts that have been filled temporarily has also been increasing since 2010, from 1,800 to 3,200. These are posts held by teachers on contracts of anywhere between one term and up to one year.\n\nAs a proportion of all posts in state-funded schools in England, that is an increase from 0.5% to 0.9%.\n\nSo there were 4,200 posts that were either vacant or temporarily filled in 2014\u20141.2% of all teaching posts. That\u2019s double the overall proportion from 2010, when it was 0.6%.\n\nSecondary schools have slightly more vacancies than primary schools. The highest vacancy rates (including temporarily filled posts) were seen in IT\u2014where it was 1.5%\u2014and in maths, the sciences, and the social sciences, where it was 1.4%.\n\nYorkshire and The Humber, Inner London and the South East have slightly higher vacancy rates (excluding temporarily filled posts) than the rest of England.\n\nWe won\u2019t know the figures for the start of the current academic year until this coming June.\n\nThe data doesn\u2019t tell us exactly what\u2019s going on\n\nIn a report on teacher training the NAO has said that:\n\n\u201cIt is difficult on the basis of current data to quantify accurately the extent to which shortages exist\u201d.\n\nThe government has said that the data on vacancies and temporarily filled positions are unlikely to reflect recruitment difficulties fully, according to the same report.\n\nOne reason for this is that the statistics on vacancies are gathered each November. The NAO says vacancies are comparatively low at this time of year, so the statistics may not properly represent the vacancies seen at other times of the academic year.\n\nWe\u2019ve asked the NAO if it can tell us the other reason or reasons.\n\nA significant proportion of school leaders have reported having difficulties recruiting teachers, according to surveys pointed to by the NAO.\n\nLabour has previously referred to a survey conducted by the TES Global education company in 2015, where 46% of nearly 250 responding head teachers said they had unfilled positions in their schools.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how this survey was carried out and so how representative it is of all head teachers. We\u2019ve contacted the TES to find out.\n\nThis is part of a series of factchecks we are doing on the supply of teachers in England.", "lang": "en"}
