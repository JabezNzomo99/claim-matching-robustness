AND ACQUITTED FROM ALL GRAFT AND CORRUPTION CASES.\"\n\nImelda Marcos is the former Philippine first lady and an incumbent lawmaker, who is accused with her late husband of embezzling billions of dollars from state coffers.\n\nFerdinand and Imelda Marcos were indicted in the US on charges they embezzled $100 million from the Philippine government, as part of a case that began shortly after the Marcos regime fell in 1986. Ferdinand died in 1989, nearly a year before the verdict in that case, in which Imelda was acquitted.\n\nA search of an archive of TIME covers on the magazine\u2019s official website shows that the cover of the issue published on October 21, 1966 did not contain the text: \u201cTHE ONLY PRESIDENT WITH THE MOST PROJECTS EVER BUILT\u2026 AND ACQUITTED FROM ALL GRAFT AND CORRUPTION CASES\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
