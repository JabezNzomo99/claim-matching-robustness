Three persons were arrested in connection to the incident.\n\nThe archived versions of the Facebook posts can be seen here and here. Multiple Facebook users have shared the post.\n\nWe found that the incident was reported by multiple news websites on July 23, 2020, when the CCTV footage went viral on social media.\n\nAccording to news reports, a power line was being laid at Gagsina village in Haryana\u2019s Karnal district.\n\nSome villagers went to the SDO of Munak electricity department with the complaint that the line that was being laid passed under their farmland. The SDO took the matter into consideration and informed the contractor that the plan was incorrect and asked him to change it. But while they were discussing the matter, five people entered the SDO\u2019s office and started thrashing the villagers.\n\nAs per the in-charge of Gharaunda police station, three men were arrested and a case was registered against five for an incident of violence at Munak electricity department. Hence, the brawl caught on camera, wherein two men were being thrashed inside an office, took place in an SDO\u2019s chamber in Haryana and not in a DM\u2019s office.", "lang": "en"}
