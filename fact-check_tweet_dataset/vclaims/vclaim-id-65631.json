Celebrated in July or August, as per dates, it is a time of buzz in the markets and streets. This year, the festival was celebrated on July 31.\n\nIn this context, a viral video on social media shows massive crowding at a market with the claim that this is Bengaluru\u2019s KR Market on Varamahalakshmi Vratam. Netizens expressed alarm at the close interaction among people and lack of social distancing.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be misleading. The viral video is from last year. The Bengaluru city administration has shut KR Market, one of India\u2019s largest flower markets, till August 31 due to Covid-19.\n\nThe archived versions of some of the viral posts can be seen here, here and here.\n\nUsing a combination of InVID and keyword search, we came across longer versions of the same video on YouTube. The captions of the videos, uploaded last year, say they were taken at KR Market in Bengaluru.\n\nWe also found that the same video was uploaded on Facebook as part of Varamahalakshmi Vratam celebrations in 2019.\n\nAs the video went viral and created panic among netizens, N Manjunatha Prasad, commissioner of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagar Palike (BBMP), clarified through his official Twitter handle that KR Market is closed till August 31, 2020, due to the pandemic.\n\nDespite strict regulations, RK Market had seen heavy rush of customers on July 20 before the onset of Shravan, a holy month for Hindus. Since then, it has been closed by the city administration.\n\nHence, the claim that crowds thronged Bengaluru\u2019s RK Market on Varamahalakshmi Vratam this year is false. The viral video is from last year. This time, the market has been closed till August 31 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.", "lang": "en"}
