On Twitter, the president claimed the report was \u201cAnother Fake Dossier!\u201d\n\nWe encourage readers to examine the report for themselves. We find it to be a straight-forward report on the results of a survey.\n\nReleased April 6, the HHS inspector general\u2019s report detailed the results of the survey of hospital administrators, making clear in the opening sentences that it provides \u201ca national snapshot of hospitals\u2019 challenges and needs in responding to the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic\u201d and \u201cis not a review of HHS response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe information is meant \u201cas an aid for HHS as it continues to lead efforts to address the public health emergency and support hospitals and other first responders,\u201d the report continued. It also said hospitals \u201cmay find the information about each other\u2019s strategies useful.\u201d\n\nThe survey was conducted March 23\u201327, and the report noted several times that the responses from hospitals reflect a \u201cpoint in time.\u201d It said: \u201cSince our interviews, some hospital challenges may have worsened and others may have improved.\u201d\n\nDuring the April 6 coronavirus task force briefing, Trump said that 1.79 million tests for COVID-19 had been conducted nationwide. (Data collected by the COVID Tracking Project, run by journalists, researchers and others, showed 1.9 million as of April 6.) The Trump administration has faced criticism for a slow rollout of testing and a lack of availability of widespread testing in the U.S. The number of tests conducted daily has increased from about 50,000 to 70,000 from March 23 to March 25 to consistently 100,000 or more from March 26 on.\n\nTrump again boasted of the U.S. doing more testing \u201cthan any other country in the world,\u201d but despite the growth in testing, that\u2019s still not true on a per-capita basis. Italy and South Korea have done more per-capita tests as of April 7, a chart from Our World in Data shows, noting that there are \u201csubstantial differences\u201d in the way the data are reported by country.\n\nIn the briefing, a reporter asked Trump about the survey\u2019s finding that \u201cthe number one complaint from those hospitals were severe shortages of testing supplies and a really long wait time.\u201d\n\nTrump replied: \u201cDid I hear the word \u2018inspector general\u2019? Really? It\u2019s wrong. And they\u2019ll talk to you about it. It\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nThree days earlier, on April 3, Trump fired the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, who had informed Congress about the whistleblower complaint that led to Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\nThe president asked for the HHS inspector general\u2019s name and said, \u201cCould politics be entered into that?\u201d\n\nAs the reporter said, the survey did find: \u201cHospitals reported that their most significant challenges centered on testing and caring for patients with COVID-19 and keeping staff safe. \u2026 Hospitals reported that severe shortages of testing supplies and extended waits for test results limited hospitals\u2019 ability to monitor the health of patients and staff.\u201d\n\nThe random phone survey of 323 hospitals in 46 states, plus Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, focused on \u201cthree key questions\u201d:\n\u2022 What are your most difficult challenges in responding to COVID-19?\n\u2022 What strategies is your hospital using to address or mitigate these challenges?\n\u2022 How could government best support hospitals responding to COVID-19?\n\nOn the availability of testing, the report said: \u201cHospitals reported that they were unable to keep up with COVID-19 testing demands because they lacked complete kits and/or the individual components and supplies needed to complete tests. Additionally, hospitals reported frequently waiting 7 days or longer for test results. When patient stays were extended while awaiting test results, this strained bed availability, personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies, and staffing.\u201d\n\nThe supplies needed to conduct tests included \u201cnasal swabs, viral transfer media, and reagents used to detect the virus.\u201d The report said the hospitals were \u201cunable to effectively test staff, patients, and others in the community who reported that they were concerned about possible exposure,\u201d with one hospital administrator saying \u201cmillions [of tests] are needed\u201d throughout the industry \u201cand we only have hundreds.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the testing concerns, hospitals reported \u201cwidespread shortages of PPE\u201d; problems maintaining \u201cadequate staffing levels\u201d; concerns about hospital capacity to care for patients; \u201cshortages of critical supplies, materials, and logistic support,\u201d such as intravenous therapy poles, linens, food and cleaning supplies; anticipation of not having enough ventilators; rising costs and decreased revenue; and \u201cchanging and sometimes inconsistent guidance from Federal, State, and local authorities\u201d that caused confusion for hospitals and the public.\n\nLater in the April 6 briefing, a reporter told Trump that the inspector general\u2019s name was Christi Grimm, and \u201cit wasn\u2019t so much her opinion, but they interviewed 323 different hospitals.\u201d Trump replied, \u201cIt still could be her opinion.\u201d\n\nThe report, again, presented the results of the survey, which showed the experiences and opinions of hospital administrators \u2014 not of the HHS inspector general.\n\nTrump asked reporters when Grimm was appointed and how long she had served in government, tweeting a day later that she \u201cspent 8 years with the Obama Administration.\u201d But Grimm joined the HHS Office of the Inspector General in 1999, according to her bio on HHS.gov, meaning she had worked in the last four administrations. She previously worked for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Grimm was appointed to her current position of principal deputy inspector general of HHS in January.\n\nAdm. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at HHS, admitted in the briefing that it was \u201ctrue\u201d that there had been \u201cseveral days of backlog at some of the major labs,\u201d an issue he said had been resolved. The inspector general report, he said, \u201cwas done here \u2014 23rd and 24th \u2014 during our ramp-up period, quite a long time ago.\u201d\n\nDuring the time period of the survey (March 23-27), however, Trump first made misleading claims about the amount of testing the U.S. had done compared with other countries.\n\nIn a March 24 virtual town hall aired on Fox News, Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019ve done more than South Korea in a short period of time,\u201d referring to a claim that the U.S. had done more testing in eight days than South Korea had done in eight weeks. The U.S. had conducted nearly 360,000 tests at that point, including some with results pending, according to the COVID Tracking Project. But South Korea, and other countries, had done more testing on a per-capita basis, despite Trump\u2019s claim the following day in a briefing that \u201cwe now are doing more testing than anybody, by far.\u201d\n\nIn that March 25 briefing, coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said that \u201cit\u2019s going to take us a while to work through the testing backlog.\u201d The following day, Vice President Mike Pence said that he was \u201cpleased to report that testing is available in all 50 states.\u201d\n\nAs we said, the IG report acknowledges that the experiences of hospitals could well have changed since the survey was conducted.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that HHS is also getting input from hospitals and other frontline responders and has already taken and continues to take actions toward each of these suggestions,\u201d it also said.\n\nWe asked the HHS inspector general\u2019s office about Trump\u2019s comments, and Tesia Williams, director of communications for the HHS OIG, replied in a statement: \u201cWe approached this survey with the same integrity and quality standards as we have in previous work.\u201d\n\nShe reiterated some of the language of the report, saying: \u201cLet me be clear, the survey is not a review of HHS\u2019 response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, we collected this information as an aid for HHS and other decision-makers as they continue to lead efforts to address the public health emergency and support hospitals and other first responders. We recognize that HHS, Congress, and other government entities across the Federal, State, local, and Tribal levels are taking substantial actions on a continual basis to support hospitals in responding to COVID-19. HHS has already taken and continues to take actions related to each of the challenges that hospitals identified in our survey, and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provides the basis for additional actions.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
