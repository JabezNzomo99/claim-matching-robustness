But a meeting directly with a presidential candidate would be unusual. Broward has about 600,000 Democratic voters \u2014 the highest number in Florida \u2014 so it is a key county for Clinton.\n\nJones has millions of followers. The claim about Clinton secretly meeting with Brenda Snipes took off on social media, and some suggested that it was part of a voter fraud scheme.\n\nWe found no evidence that such a meeting took place \u2014 because it didn\u2019t.\n\nWithin days, Stone retracted his claim. (A retraction doesn\u2019t allow a political figure to avoid the Truth-O-Meter, but we will explain what he initially said and then his latest explanation.)\n\nWhen we first heard the claim about a Snipes-Clinton meeting we were skeptical. Although Snipes is a Democrat, the former school administrator is not known for partisan or political involvement. In fact, a long list of politicians endorsed her opponent in the primary, although Snipes then won in a landslide. Snipes was first appointed to the position in 2003 by Republican Gov. Jeb Bush.\n\nIn an Oct. 27 interview, Snipes told us she hadn\u2019t met with Clinton.\n\n\"She has not requested a meeting from me,\" Snipes said. \"I haven\u2019t met with anybody and neither has my staff. I don\u2019t even know who the members of her staff are. Neither I nor my staff met with Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nSnipes told the Sun Sentinel that it was a \"big fat lie\" that she met with Clinton. A spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign in Florida also denied that such a meeting took place.\n\nStone said he would post photos of the Clinton-Snipes meeting on Jones\u2019 website Infowars \"shortly\" but never did.\n\nWhen we spoke to Stone on Oct. 28, he explained how he heard the allegation -- third-hand. He lacked even the most basic details, such as where this alleged meeting took place.\n\nHe said information came from a coordinator for Citizens for Trump, a grassroots group. Stone said that the coordinator told him he spoke with two women from Citizens for Trump. The women said that they saw Clinton enter a meeting with Snipes.\n\n\"They claim they were inadvertently in a secured area of a presidential candidate visit,\" when they spotted Clinton enter a meeting with Snipes. \"Both admit they ran, they left the place in a hurry because they were shooed off by security.\"\n\nThe women tried to take photos and video while they were dashing away, Stone said. The photos didn\u2019t show anything, and Stone said he is waiting for video.\n\n\"If Snipes denies it and there is no evidence to the contrary, I can say this is an incorrect report, but I\u2019m not ready to conclude that yet,\" Stone said.\n\nAfter giving Stone a few more days to track down information, we circled back with him Oct. 31. That\u2019s when he retracted his story -- or rather moved his story to a different county.\n\nStone told PolitiFact Florida that he went back on Jones\u2019 show Oct. 30 to say he was wrong about Snipes meeting with Clinton in Broward.\n\n\"I was incorrect about that,\" he said on the radio show. \"In fact, I was off by a county. The Clinton entourage pulled up behind the West Palm Beach office of the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections. Hillary Clinton was physically seen by at least three witnesses meeting with officials from the building. These observers were shooed away. ... Palm Beach is of course ground zero of the Democrats\u2019 vote stealing operation.\"\n\nAgain, the Clinton campaign said no meeting took place -- and Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher also said she didn\u2019t meet with Clinton.\n\nIt is true that Clinton was in Broward and Palm Beach counties the week that Stone made these claims. She gave speeches at Broward College on Oct. 25 and Palm Beach State College on Oct. 26.\n\nDuring his interview with Jones, Stone tried to portray Snipes as incompetent and pointed to ballots missing the medical marijuana amendment. Stone said that Snipes announced that the amendment \"isn\u2019t going to be on the ballot in Broward County because of some kind of a screw up.\"\n\nThat\u2019s an exaggeration. The amendment is on the ballot in Broward, but four absentee ballots so far have turned up missing the amendment.\n\nA group supporting marijuana legalization sued Snipes over the ballots omitting Amendment 2. On Oct. 28, a Broward judge ruled in Snipes favor and concluded that she had taken appropriate steps to remedy the errors including providing replacement ballots.\n\nStone said Clinton showed up in Broward County and slipped into a private meeting with elections supervisor Brenda Snipes.\n\nStone was wrong. He heard it third-hand from Trump supporters who claim they stumbled across such a meeting. Snipes and a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign in Florida denied such a meeting took place and we found no evidence that it did.\n\nDays later, Stone admitted he was wrong but then claimed that Clinton met with elections officials in Palm Beach County. He lacks evidence for that claim, too -- and both the elections supervisor and the Clinton campaign deny it.\n\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire!", "lang": "en"}
