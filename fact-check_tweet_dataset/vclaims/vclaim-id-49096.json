Gates\u2019 father was a lawyer, not a woodcutter.\n\nThe viral post attempts to paint Gates, worth an estimated $96.3 billion, as ungenerous by recounting an alleged incident in which he only tipped a waiter $5 after dining at a restaurant. One of his daughters, the post claims, had previously tipped $500.\n\n\u201cShe is the daughter of the world\u2019s richest man, but I am the son of a wood cutter,\u201d Gates supposedly said to justify his tip.

The post does not offer a source or give details about where it supposedly happened, and the Daily Caller found no credible reports of Gates giving a $5 tip to a waiter.\n\nGates grew up in an upper-middle class family. His father is a retired Washington attorney, and his late mother worked as a teacher and served on several corporate boards, according to the biography on Gate\u2019s blog.\n\nHe and his wife Melinda chair the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the world\u2019s largest charitable organization, and have pledged to donate at least half of their vast wealth to philanthropic causes, according to Forbes. To date, they have donated at least $35.8 billion worth of Microsoft stock, making the post\u2019s claim of him being ungenerous even more dubious.\n\nVariations of the story have been circulating online since at least 2012, according to Snopes.", "lang": "en"}
