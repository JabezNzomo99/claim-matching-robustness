When you look at these photos of how it took place, you can see the actions within video games and others.\u201d\n\nAt no point, however, did McCarthy ever bring up Japan in his appearance on Bartiromo\u2019s show. No credible online sources link McCarthy to the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post either.\n\nThe image likely stems from a viral tweet that has since been deleted. Prior to its deletion, the tweet had garnered more than 3,500 retweets and 8,000 likes, according to the Wayback Machine.\n\nOther Republicans, including Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and President Donald Trump, discussed violent video games during the wake of the mass shootings.", "lang": "en"}
