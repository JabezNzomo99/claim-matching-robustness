Even in states without online tracking systems, voters can call their local elections offices to check their ballot status. (See this spreadsheet for links to state tracking systems.) Also, some states accept and count ballots after Election Day if they were postmarked by Nov. 3.\n\nA voter unsure if their ballot has been received would only be allowed a provisional ballot. Those ballots are counted after the election, and if it is determined that a mail-in vote was received from the same voter, the provisional ballot would be discarded.\n\nTrump raised eyebrows with comments in an interview with WECT TV6 in Wilmington, North Carolina, on Sept. 2. when he was asked if he had confidence in the estimated 600,000 votes that will be cast by mail-in ballot in the state.\n\nTrump, Sept. 2: Well, they\u2019ll go out and they\u2019ll vote, and they\u2019re going to have to go and check their vote by going to the poll and voting that way because if it tabulates then they won\u2019t be able to do that. So let them send it in, and let them go vote. And if their system is as good as they say it is then obviously they won\u2019t be able to vote. If it isn\u2019t tabulated they\u2019ll be able to vote. So that\u2019s the way it is, and that\u2019s what they should do. \u2026 But send in your ballots, send them in strong, whether it\u2019s solicited or unsolicited. The absentees are fine, we have to work to get them. You know, it means something. And you send them in, but you go to vote. If they haven\u2019t counted it, you can vote. So, that\u2019s the way I view it.\n\nThe president\u2019s words were quickly seized upon by some who warned it is illegal to vote twice. For example, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel tweeted a link to Trump\u2019s advice, along with a personal warning: \u201cHey folks. Attorney General Nessel here-top law enforcement official in Michigan, for those keeping track. Don\u2019t try this at home. I will prosecute you.\u201d\n\nThe following day, Trump tweeted a series of messages clarifying his position:\n\nTwitter flagged the second and third tweets, leaving them visible \u201cin the public\u2019s interest,\u201d but adding a warning that they \u201cviolated the Twitter Rules about civic and election integrity.\u201d\n\nIn an article published by Slate on Sept. 3, Richard L. Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California\u2013Irvine School of Law, noted that it is illegal to attempt to vote twice in an election, according to both North Carolina and federal law. Hasen said a case could be made that Trump may have broken state law that makes it illegal to \u201cinduce\u201d anyone to try to cast more than one vote.\n\nIn the wake of Trump\u2019s comments, Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections, issued a statement warning, \u201cIt is illegal to vote twice in an election. N.C.G.S. \u00a7 163-275(7) makes it a Class I felony for a voter, \u2018with intent to commit a fraud to register or vote at more than one precinct or more than one time \u2026 in the same primary or election.\u2019 Attempting to vote twice in an election or soliciting someone to do so also is a violation of North Carolina law.\u201d\n\nBell went on to explain the numerous checks in place in North Carolina to prevent people from double voting. The state has an electronic pollbook that records who has already voted \u2014 including by mail-in ballot \u2014 and if someone were to insist on voting anyway, they would be offered a provisional ballot. Election officials would conduct research \u201cafter Election Day to determine whether it should be counted.\u201d\n\nBell noted that if someone requests an absentee ballot, but then decides to vote in person, they should simply discard the mail-in ballot and vote in person.\n\nShe also noted that there are several ways for mail-in voters to check the status of their ballot, without showing up to the polls on Election Day. Voters can use the state\u2019s Voter Search Tool to find out whether their ballot was accepted by the local county board of elections; they can sign up for BallotTrax, scheduled to launch in the next few days, to track their ballot through the system; or they can contact their local board of elections.\n\nIn an interview on CNN on Sept. 3, North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein described Trump\u2019s call for mail-in voters to check the status of their votes at polling places on Election Day as \u201cpoor advice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a really strong election administration system here in North Carolina that ensures that every eligible voter can vote easily, safely and securely,\u201d Stein said. \u201cWhen you mail in your absentee ballot, you can track it online, and it will show on the website that your ballot has been received. There is zero reason to go vote in person once you\u2019ve mailed in your ballot. \u201d\n\nMatthew Weil, director of the Elections Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said polling officials in most states won\u2019t know whether or not a mail-in ballot has been received and accepted. If people come in asking for the status of their mail-in ballot, polling officials \u201caren\u2019t going to have that information,\u201d he said. Those who are concerned their mail-in ballot may not have been received will be directed to fill out a provisional ballot. They won\u2019t be given a regular ballot. Provisional ballots are counted after the election, and if a mail-in ballot was received, the provisional ballot will be discarded.\n\nIn other words, he said, there will not be a \u201cwidespread ability\u201d for voters to cast two ballots. The system, he said, will prevent it.\n\nJustin Levitt, an election law professor at Loyola Marymount University, told us in an email that whether poll officials would know if a ballot has been accepted will depend on the jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cIn part, it depends on the mail,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cIn part, it depends on when the jurisdiction logs mail ballots (some count mail ballots before election day, some after). But it\u2019s always possible to mail a ballot in the morning and then go to the polls 10 minutes later \u2013 there\u2019s no jurisdiction where the pollworkers would know at that point.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, he said, \u201cevery jurisdiction has a way of making sure two votes don\u2019t count.\u201d Levitt said the safeguards Trump described to prevent double-voting are \u201cmostly right.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn jurisdictions that begin counting mail ballots after election day, they check each mail ballot against the pollbook entries: any mail ballot cast in the name of someone who voted in person will not count. In jurisdictions that begin counting earlier, the mechanism depends on the jurisdiction,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cJurisdictions with electronic pollbooks can usually operate with real-time updates in a synchronized system: entries are logged as people arrive at the polls and logged as mail ballots are counted \u2014 if someone\u2019s trying to process the mail ballot and there\u2019s an entry for a voter voting in person, the mail ballot isn\u2019t counted; if someone\u2019s trying to vote in person and there\u2019s an entry for a voter having voted by mail, that person will only be allowed to vote a provisional ballot (which won\u2019t count).\u201d\n\nJurisdictions that don\u2019t have electronic pollbooks will have mail ballots listed on a pollbook if those were already counted, and a mail-in voter showing up in person would only be able to vote a provisional ballot, he said. The remainder of the mail-in ballots would be counted after Election Day.\n\nJust because there are mechanisms to ensure people don\u2019t vote twice doesn\u2019t make it OK to try, Levitt said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a big dog at home, and he doesn\u2019t like intruders. It\u2019s exceedingly unlikely anybody\u2019s going to be able to break in successfully,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cIt\u2019s still a crime to try it, whether you succeed or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe federal statute (52 USC 10307(e)(1)) says that it\u2019s a crime to vote more than once \u2026 and that that doesn\u2019t include casting an additional ballot if all prior ballots were invalidated (past tense),\u201d Levitt said. \u201cThat clearly exempts bringing a mail ballot to the polls, having it invalidated, and then voting in person (that\u2019s fine). It also clearly exempts voting a paper ballot in person, making a mistake and having it invalidated, and then voting another paper ballot.\u201d\n\nBut for voters who cast a ballot both by mail and in person, \u201cthe fact that that mail ballot will later be invalidated doesn\u2019t relieve you from the scope of the statute,\u201d Levitt continued. \u201cAnd many states don\u2019t have the federal caveat. South Carolina, for example, says it\u2019s unlawful to vote more than once at the same election, for the same election. Period. Which sure seems to include what the President is specifically advocating.\u201d\n\nWhether it is a crime may hinge on intent, Hasen, at the University of California\u2013Irvine School of Law, told us in an email.\n\n\u201cState law directs handling of the person who comes in,\u201d Hasen said. \u201cIf they say they\u2019ve already voted by mail they won\u2019t be allowed a regular ballot. And their provisional ballot won\u2019t be counted if their mail in ballot shows up. As to whether it is a crime, I think it depends on intent. A voter who says I\u2019m not sure if my ballot was received is in a different position from one who knowingly mails and seeks to cast (even a provisional) ballot.\u201d\n\nIn New Mexico, for example, the secretary of state assures, barcodes will allow voters to electronically track the status of their ballot.\n\n\u201cIf you mail your ballot back but it still has not been received by Election Day, you still have the option to go to a polling place and cast a ballot,\u201d the secretary of state\u2019s website notes. \u201cYou will just need to sign an affidavit cancelling the mailed ballot you submitted.\u201d\n\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 19 states require an online system for tracking absentee/mail-in ballots, though a few only require it for military or overseas voters. Another 13 states plus the District of Columbia maintain webpages for tracking absentee/mailed ballots, even though it\u2019s not required by statute, NCSL said.\n\nWe found that even more states offer tracking for this election. Only seven states don\u2019t have online ballot tracking, though one of those \u2014 Maine \u2014 is developing a system it intends to launch before Election Day, a spokeswoman for Maine\u2019s secretary of state told us. And other states say voters can contact local elections offices to check the status of their mail-in ballot.\n\nVoting officials say those are far better methods to check whether your mail-in ballot has been accepted than to show up at the polling place on Election Day.\n\n\u201cI would not say that many precincts have the ability to tell a voter whether their ballot has been received AND accepted for counting,\u201d Lonna Atkeson, a political science professor at the University of New Mexico and an expert in election administration, told us via email. \u201cSome places might be able to tell you that, some places might be able to tell you it was received. A lot of places, most I would say, wouldn\u2019t have that information at all.\u201d\n\nIn addition to those states that have online tracking systems, Atkeson said, \u201cthere\u2019s often also a county/jurisdiction hotline that people can call to find if their ballot has arrived. So voters can absolutely determine this, but I wouldn\u2019t say that the polling place would necessarily be the best place to find out that information.\u201d\n\nWeil, at the Bipartisan Policy Center, recommends that people not send mail-in ballots in the week before the election. If you have waited that long, he said, you ought to put the mail-in ballot in a designated election drop box, or vote in person.\n\nPerhaps one of the most troubling concerns, voting experts say, is that Trump\u2019s advice could wreak Election Day havoc.\n\nIf people take Trump\u2019s advice in large numbers on Election Day, it is likely to \u201cgum up the works\u201d at polling places and result in long lines at the polls, Weil told us.\n\n\u201cLines are already going to be long in some places on Election Day,\u201d Hasen said in his piece for Slate. \u201cThe pandemic means it is harder to find poll workers and so there will be polling place consolidations and fewer workers, all contributing to a longer queue. Trump\u2019s suggestion for his supporters to go to a polling place to try to vote twice\u2014and via a complex procedure of trying to get a poll worker to confirm that an absentee ballot has been tabulated, which in some cases it will not have been\u2014will add to those long lines. \u2026 Those long lines will do real damage to an Election Day infrastructure that is already looking stretched to the limits.\u201d\n\nLori Robertson, D\u2019Angelo Gore and Rem Rieder contributed to this story.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Please consider a donation to FactCheck.org.
