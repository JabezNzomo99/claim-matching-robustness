However, these photographs were often shared on social media with incomplete or untrue information.\n\nFor starters, this photograph does not show a restaurant adhering to any new guidelines implemented by the Netherlands government. This photograph was taken at Mediamatic, an art gallery and restaurant in Amsterdam, as they tested out a proposed dining solution for when the restaurant was allowed to reopen.\n\nMediamatic explained on its website that these \u201cquarantine greenhouses\u201d would allow for two people to dine together. The restaurant notes that these dining pods would only be recommended for people who were already living together and that this dining plan was not approved yet by the government. While Mediamatic is, as of this writing, taking reservations for when social distancing guidelines are expected to be relaxed, they note that these reservations may end up being canceled if the plan is not approved.\n\nDutch News reported on Mediamatic\u2019s \u201cquarantine greenhouse\u201d dining plan in May 2020:\n\nIn Amsterdam, art gallery and restaurant Mediamatic hopes to win approval to organise fine dining in small greenhouses overlooking the water. The package is already sold out up to the end of June \u2013 even though no-one knows if the soirees can go ahead. The popularity of the deal is a sign of the frustration many are beginning to feel as the Netherlands moves into May \u2013 with the prospect of several more weeks of being told to stay home ahead.\n\nThe viral photograph is available via Mediamatic\u2019s website along with the following caption:\n\nTesting Serres Separees at Mediamatic ETEn \u2013 Safe water side dining in Amsterdam. Soon, we\u2019ll offer really nice plant-based dinner in our greenhouses on the Amsterdam water side of the Oosterdok. We are testing the setup now whilst waiting for permission to re-open our restaurant and art space. Of course, these chambres separees are recommended only for people that are already living together. Photo was taken at Mediamatic ETEN in Biotoop Dijkspark during our testing on April 28, 2020.\n\nTo sum up: The Netherlands government did not implement new guidelines that would allow restaurants to reopen by installing personal dining pods. This viral photograph shows one restaurant\u2019s proposed solution to dining out during the COVID-19 pandemic. While Mediamatic is taking reservations for these quarantine greenhouses, this solution has not been approved by local officials.", "lang": "en"}
