Khan had requested his fans not to speculate as he will himself share the story once the further investigations come up with a conclusive diagnosis. Social media did exactly the opposite of what Khan requested and at least one mainstream media joined in to fuel speculation about his health. What was so far a social media rumor was circulated further by NewsX by adding disclaimers like, \u201cit is rumoured\u201d, \u201cif latest reports are to be believed\u201d and \u201cwe don\u2019t confirm any such news\u201d.\n\nSoon after Khan\u2019s tweet, a screenshot has been doing the rounds on Whatsapp. Posted like a news item without giving the link or the source, the screenshot diagnoses Khan with a deadly cancer.\n\nNewsX initially published a story with the headline \u201cUnconfirmed reports suggest Irrfan Khan has brain cancer; fans shocked, prayers pour in from all over the world\u201d. On the lines of the Whatsapp screenshot, the article went on to diagnose the cancer as Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) Grade IV, also called \u2018death on diagnosis\u2019. Adding the rider, \u201cIf the latest reports are to be believed\u201d the news site stated that \u201cIrrfan had been having convulsion attacks along with slurring of speech due which he had to be admitted into the Hospital immediately.\u201d\n\nThe second version of the NewsX story added additional details of Khan being admitted to Kokilaben Hospital under a new headline, \u201cIrrfan Khan is rumoured to have been diagnosed with Brain Cancer; admitted in Kokilaben Hospital.\u201d\n\nTaking words circulating on a WhatsApp rumor, the news site added, \u201cThe tumor has been identified as \u2018death on diagnosis\u2019 as death becomes certain once the diagnosis is confirmed. The aggressiveness of the tumor is believed to be very high. However, the doctors need to go for a needle biopsy to ascertain the exact nature of the tumour. According to latest reports, Irrfan Khan will be going through a chemo coupled with Radiation Therapy. The final decision will only be made after the reports of biopsy are finally out.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the article, it added \u201cNewsX has no confirmed medical reports but the latest reports circulating on the internet suggest the same.\u201d\n\nAfter it emerged that news about Irrfan Khan\u2019s health was untrue, NewsX amended its story one more time. The latest headline of the News X story chose to stick closer to the fact from Irrfan Khan\u2019s tweet, stating that \u201cIrrfan Khan reveals he has a rare disease\u201d\n\nThis time NewsX story shared the screenshot of the social media rumor stating that \u201cThere are some unconfirmed claims on the internet which are floating around. One of such screenshots is given below, we don\u2019t confirm any such news and we wish Irrfan Khan a speedy recovery.\u201d\n\nApart from NewsX, several Hindi publications have also carried the unverified news about \u2018cancer\u2019 and \u2018death on diagnosis\u2019. Jansatta, a prominent Hindi publication reported that Irrfan Khan is suffering from a serious illness and has been admitted to Kokilaben Hospital. The article quoted the report of a publication called \u2018Bollywood Life\u2019 for this news.\n\nCatch News Hindi reported that Irrfan Khan had been admitted to the hospital due to serious illness.\n\nAs regards the situation regarding Khan\u2019s health, officials at Kokilaben Hospital have confirmed to PTI that Khan is not admitted there. Khan\u2019s team also refuted that he is admitted in a hospital and declined to comment if he had cancer.\n\nKomal Nahta, a film trade analyst tweeted that Khan is in Delhi and news relating to his hospitalisation is fake.\n\nThe rumor mongering about Irrfan Khan\u2019s health comes at a time when Indian media is already under fire for its over the top coverage of Sridevi\u2019s death. Khan\u2019s request asking his fans not to speculate about his health has fallen on deaf ears. Social media as usual took the lead in rumor-mongering but it is unfortunate to see a section of mainstream media join in as well.", "lang": "en"}
