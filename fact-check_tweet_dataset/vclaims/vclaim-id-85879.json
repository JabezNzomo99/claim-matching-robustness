They recruited interview candidates through Craigslist, which yielded about 200 responses. Then, after selecting candidates based on level of political interest and various demographic characteristics, they conducted 25 interviews lasting between 10 and 25 minutes.\n\nA key part of the interview was to encourage factual assertions, such as asking how the person would explain a topic to a kindergartner or someone with a different ideological point of view. Then, to verify the patterns of beliefs found in the interviews, the researchers conducted surveys using a representative sample from Google Consumer Surveys.\n\nOne major concern that emerged from the interviews was the level of the national debt. But interestingly, the researchers came to believe that the policy views were based on a mistaken metaphor \u2014 comparing the national debt to household debt. \u201cI don\u2019t spend money that I don\u2019t have; we don\u2019t spend above our means,\u201d said \u201cAmy,\u201d one person who was interviewed. It is little surprise that Amy would believe this, as The Fact Checker has frequently heard politicians make the same analogy.\n\nBut as Thorson notes, this is misplaced. When a household owes debt, it is generally to a bank or credit card company, as opposed to another person to the household. But a good chunk of the federal debt is owed from one part of the government to another, such as the Social Security trust funds. (For more information on this, read The Fact Checker\u2019s Guide to Social Security.) Unlike a household, the government also can tax and print money\u2013and also in theory uses its borrowing to invest in projects with a long-term payoff, such as research and education.\n\nMoreover, because of that household analogy, people wrongly assumed that just as a bank can repossess a person\u2019s property, so, too, could China. \u201cArianne\u201d said: \u201cWe owe China our backside because they\u2019ve lended [sic] to us.\u201d And \u201cHolly\u201d said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want them to come here and be like, \u2018we\u2019re taking over your country because you owe us so much money.\u2019\u201d\n\nSo, as part of the survey research, Thorson and her colleagues asked 250 randomly selected people whether China holds more than half of the U.S. debt or whether it holds less than half. When a \u201cnot sure\u201d option was offered, 50.7 percent of respondents said they thought China owned at least half the U.S. debt, 16.8 percent said less than half, and 32.5 percent said they were not sure. Thus more than half were confident in their answer \u2014 and got it completely wrong.\n\n\u201cOur free stuff [government programs] today is being paid for by taking money from our children and borrowing from China. When that note comes due \u2014 and this isn\u2019t racist \u2026 but it\u2019s going to be like slavery when that note is due, right? We are going to be beholden to a foreign master.\u201d\n\nYes, China is a biggest single holder of Treasury debt, owning $1.252 trillion as of October of 2014, but that amounts to less than 10 percent of all U.S. debt held by the public, which was about $12.8 trillion at the end of October.\n\nMoreover, Japan is close behind China, holding $1.222 trillion in U.S. Treasury securities, and yet for some reason its holdings generate much less attention. Next on the list is tiny Belgium \u2014 and one rarely considers Belgium as among the United States\u2019s \u201cforeign masters.\u201d (Update: Some astute readers pointed out that there are signs that Belgium is actually acting as an agent for China, disguising the true size of China\u2019s holdings, which suggests China is highly conscious of the political consequences of the perception that it holds a huge chunk of U.S. debt.)\n\nBut there is a further wrinkle. Nearly one-third of the debt held overseas is not held by governments, but by private investors, according to the Treasury Department. Put another way, only about one-third of publicly-traded debt is held by foreign governments \u2014 and China barely is in first place among many.\n\nReaders who want to know more about the possible policy implications of foreign holdings of debt may find this Congressional Research Service report of interest. But in meantime, readers should stop listening to politicians who suggest China is as bad as Mr. Potter, the greedy banker in \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
