Average residential consumption was 155.1 litres per person per day.\n\nBut the most recent data shows that South Africa had an average total water consumption of\n\nin 2014. Average residential consumption was 111.79 litres per person per day. These were both much lower than the 235 litres Tau mentioned in his speech.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that IBNET\u2019s data is based on \u201ca subset of municipalities that may or may not represent the country average\u201d, according to the organisation.\n\nThe other source Moraka provided was a department of water and sanitation study from 2017.
