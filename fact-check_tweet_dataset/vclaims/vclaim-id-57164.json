Curtis said Leffingwell lives in the Balcones Drive part of West Austin and among other council members, Sheryl Cole lives in Wilshire Woods, Laura Morrison resides in Old West Austin, Chris Riley is downtown, Randy Shade lives in Clarksville and Bill Spelman hails from Hyde Park. Council Member Mike Martinez told us he lives in the Senate Hills part of East Austin, but plans to move later this year to East 11th Street near Chicon.\n\n \n\n Curtis said the latest South Austinites on the council, Betty Dunkerley and Jennifer Kim, finished their terms in June 2008.\n\n \n\n As we closed this check, Nofziger called to say he\u2019d originally heard from local activists that the council now lacks South Austin residents.\n\n \n\n We rate his statement True.", "lang": "en"}
