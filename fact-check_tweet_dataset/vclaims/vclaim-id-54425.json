In the message, it is mentioned that the home remedy was prepared by a student of Pondicherry University and he has prepared it by mixing 1 tablespoon of black pepper powder, 2 tablespoons of honey and some ginger juice. It is mentioned that if the mixture is consumed consecutively for five days, the effects of Coronavirus would be suppressed. Let\u2019s fact-check the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: The World Health Organisation (WHO) has accepted an Indian student\u2019s home remedy for the cure of COVID-19. Fact: There is no authentic information that an Indian student from Pondicherry University has found a cure for COVID-19. WHO website clearly states that, to date, there are medicines that can prevent or treat COVID-19. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\n\nWhen we searched to check if any Indian student from Pondicherry University has found a cure for COVID-19, no news reports confirming the same were found. Regarding the cure mentioned in the post, many news reports mentioned that the mixture (honey + black pepper powder + ginger juice) is a good remedy for cold and cough and also boosts immunity. Those reports can be seen here, here and here. But none of these reports claim this to be a cure for COVID-19.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has debunked myths that are being spread around the coronavirus disease. One of the myths debunked also states that including Hot peppers (one of the ingredients mentioned in the post) in the food cannot cure or prevent COVID-19.\n\nIn the same Mythbusters section on the WHO website, it can read that, to date, there are no medicines that can prevent or treat COVID-19.\n\nTo sum it up, WHO has not accepted any Indian student\u2019s home remedy for COVID-19 cure.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
