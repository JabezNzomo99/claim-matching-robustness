(He said: \u201cThe 1 percent pays 80 percent of all taxes. Fifty percent of the population of the U.S. pays no taxes.\u201d) Some readers disagreed, complaining that it was silly to vet his statement. Nonetheless, he earned Four Pinocchios.\n\n2: Obama\u2019s claim that the GOP has \u2018blocked every serious idea\u2019\n\nBefore this fact check appeared, the president three times had claimed \u201cRepublicans in Congress have blocked every serious idea to strengthen the middle class.\u201d But we found at least three bills that had passed this year that Obama had lauded as helping the middle class. He earned Three Pinocchios\u2014and then adjusted his language in his next speech.\n\nThis was a survey of over-the-top language used by Democrats concerning the Supreme Court\u2019s 5-to-4 ruling that, as a closely held company, Hobby Lobby was not required to pay for all of the birth-control procedures mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Lawmakers attributed the language to either misspeaking or offer an opinion, so no Pinocchios were awarded. But we warned: \u201cAll too often, lawmakers leap to conclusions that are not warranted by the facts at hand.\u201d\n\n4: Sebelius\u2019s claim that Obamacare has brought \u2018affordable coverage\u2019 to 22 million people\n\nWe dissected a claim by former Health and Human Services secretary Kathleen Sebelius that \u201cthere are now 22 million people with affordable coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act.\u201d While elements of her calculation was correct, she included some dubious items, such as 5 million from plans sold directly by insurance brokers. So she earned Two Pinocchios for an inflated figure.\n\n5: Bill Clinton\u2019s strained comparison of diplomatic deaths in different administrations\n\nThe former president, seeking to rebut attacks on his wife over the deaths at a U.S. facility in Benghazi asserted that there was \u201czero\u201d Republican outrage during the \u201cten different instances [that] occurred when President Bush was in office where American diplomatic personnel were killed around the world.\u201d But he was wrong: At least one of the deaths led to congressional hearings and a government report. Moreover, Clinton ignored the similar one-off attacks that have killed diplomatic personnel during Obama\u2019s presidency, making it an unbalanced comparison. He earned Two Pinocchios.", "lang": "en"}
