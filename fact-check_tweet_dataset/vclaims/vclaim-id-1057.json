However, eight employees have since filed racial discrimination charges with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights in which they state that they were prohibited from working on the floor in the jail where Chauvin was taken.\n\nChauvin, who was filmed pinning Floyd, an unarmed black man, to the street by pressing a knee into his neck for nearly nine minutes on May 25, was arrested on murder and manslaughter charges four days later ( here , here ). According to booking records, Chauvin was processed at the Ramsey County Jail in St. Paul the same day.\n\nAn article linked in the posts ( here ) says, \u201cAt 10:00 pm Friday 5/29/20 the InNewsWeekly investigative team received a tip from a reliable source that black corrections officers have been banned from the 5th floor where Derek Chauvin is being held.\u201d\n\nAsked about the InNewsWeekly article, a spokesperson for the Ramsey County Sheriff\u2019s Office, which has jurisdiction over the Ramsey County Adult Detention Center, told Reuters on June 5 via email that there was \u201cno truth to the report, and that Chauvin \u201cwas treated according to procedure.\u201d That spokesperson said on June 9 that black corrections officers were in fact \u201cassigned to guard him as part of the regular routine.\u201d\n\nOn June 21, Minnesota newspaper the Star Tribune reported that eight minority Ramsey County corrections officers had filed discrimination charges \u201cafter they were barred from guarding or having any other contact with former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin\u201d (here).\n\nMinnesota lawyer Bonnie Smith, who is representing the eight corrections officers, provided Reuters with a redacted copy of the charges of discrimination on the basis of race brought forth against the county jail. In the document, the correctional officers, who describe themselves as having black or brown skin, report asked to leave or avoid the fifth floor of the jail, where Chauvin was to be held.\n\nThe employees go on to describe a meeting with the jail Superintendent later on May 29, in which he is said to have admitted there had been an order to prohibit officers of color from the 5th floor but that he had changed his mind about the order.\n\nThe Ramsey County Sheriff\u2019s Office did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment on this information and clarification on its previous statement.\n\nOn May 31, Chauvin was moved to the Hennepin County Jail in Minneapolis, where he is currently in custody ( here , here ).\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
