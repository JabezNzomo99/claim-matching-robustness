The image is being shared in a misleading context; a reverse image search found the same image has circulated online since at least in 2017 in online articles and posts about unusual X-rays.\n\nThe image was published here by a Facebook page with more than 900 followers.\n\nText in traditional Chinese characters and English language superimposed on the image says: \u201cHong Kong protesters intentionally hit by a taxi\u201d and \u201cFemale victim\u2019s legs severely damaged, chance of paralysis\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nA caption in traditional Chinese language characters alongside the Facebook post translates to English as: \u201cThe driver looks severely injured, but it\u2019s just skin injury, while the girl was...Come on, we don\u2019t need a visual look anymore, but real hurt, to treat people the same way as we are treated. Next time should be smart, 12345 kicks off, have you played basketball before? Three people box out on the left side, the other two cut in. Easy but serious injury can be made by many ways, for example cutting off the artery with sharp tools, stepping on the throat with feet, sealing one\u2019s nose with glue paper for 30 seconds, then punching and kicking without letting one breathe and so on. Make sure that the person will never recover, leaving some permanent damage!!!\n\n\u201c(There are protesters who said the girl is not injured as severely as what the picture shows, but please remember, the injured protesters over these months, while today this driver is only slightly hurt, and let the world know the hardline protesters acted so gently to those hurting them, in which this is so contradictory!)\u201d\n\nThe post references an incident at a pro-democracy protest in Sham Shui Po on October 6, 2019, in which a taxi driver drove his vehicle into protesters.\n\nHospital authorities said three people were taken to hospital in a serious condition after the crash. Here is an AFP report about the protests on October 6.\n\nThe photo was also shared on Facebook here, here, here and here with a similar claim. The image was also shared here on Instagram and here on Hong Kong forum LIHKG with a similar claim.\n\nBut the image is being shared in a misleading context; it has circulated online since at least 2017 as a stock X-ray image.\n\nA reverse image search on Google found it was published in this January 11, 2017, post on Pikabu, a Russian-language news and discussion website, by user VinylDJ.\n\nThe post\u2019s Russian-language headline translates to English as: \u201cUnusual and scary x-rays\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the misleading picture (L) and the image from Pikabu (R):\n\nThe image also appeared here on Pinterest.\n\nThe only comment on the post states: \u201cRadcom Case #1 Anterior View. Fractured at: Lateral Surface, Anterior Border, Interosseus Surface (and Oblique Line?).\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the image on Pinterest:\n\nThe image also appeared here on a website called Buy Xrays Online.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the image:\n\nOn October 7, 2019, a spokesperson for Hong Kong\u2019s Hospital Authority told AFP by phone that of the 30 people, aged 13-92, admitted to hospital after the protests on October 6, three were in a serious condition, 16 were stable and others were discharged or condition was unknown.\n\nThe condition of the pedestrians involved in the Sham Shui Po crash was \u201cunknown\u201d. The taxi driver\u2019s condition was \u201cstable\u201d as of late October 7, 2019.", "lang": "en"}
