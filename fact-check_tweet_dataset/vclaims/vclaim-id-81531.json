This article is a fact check of the claims.\n\nWhat is the PMSSY?\n\n The annual report (2017-18) of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW) states that \u2018the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) has been launched with the objective of correcting regional imbalances in the availability of affordable/reliable tertiary healthcare services and to also augment facilities for quality medical education in the country. PMSSY has two components \u2013 setting up of AIIMS like institutions and up-gradation of existing State Government Medical Colleges/ Institutions and is being taken up in phased manner. Upgradation programme broadly envisages improving health infrastructure through construction of Super Specialty Blocks/Trauma centres etc. and procurement of medical equipment for existing as well as new facilities on Central and State share basis. In first phase of PMSSY, six AIIMS one each at Bhopal, Bhubaneswar, Jodhpur, Patna, Raipur and Rishikesh and up-gradation of 13 existing State Government Medical Colleges/Institutions(GMCIs) have been taken up. Under Phase-II of PMSSY, AIIMS at Rae Bareli and up-gradation of 6 is being taken up\u2019.\n\nThe website of PMSSY states that \u2018PMSSY was first launched in March 2006 with the primary objective of correcting the imbalances in availability of affordable/reliable tertiary level healthcare in the country in general and to augment facilities for quality medical education in the under-served States\u2019.\n\nAre 20 new super specialty hospitals being set up?\n\n The first claim is that \u201820 new super specialty AIIMS \u2013 like hospitals being set up\u2019.\n\nThe website of the scheme states that \u2018six AIIMS-like institutions, one each in the States of Bihar (Patna), Chhattisgarh (Raipur), Madhya Pradesh (Bhopal), Orissa (Bhubaneswar), Rajasthan (Jodhpur) and Uttaranchal (Rishikesh) have been setup under the PMSSY scheme. Approved cost of each new AIIMS in first phase was 820 crores. Rs. 620 crores towards cost of construction and Rs. 200 crores for procurement of Medical Equipment and modular Operation Theatres\u2019.\n\nThe six AIIMS mentioned above were approved by the union cabinet in 2006 and a revised cabinet approval was given in 2010, both during the UPA. As per the latest information shared in the Lok Sabha, these six institutions are more or less functional.\n\nIn addition to these, the current government has approved setting up of 15 AIIMS like institutions in the last 5 years, as per the information shared in the Lok Sabha. Thirteen of these have received cabinet approval and are at various stages of implementation.\n\nHave 2 new AIIMS been announced?\n\n The second claim is that \u20182 new AIIMS announced for Jharkhand and Gujarat in 2017-18\u2019.\n\nPhase six of the PMSSY saw the announcement of two new AIIMS, one in Gujarat and one in Jharkhand. This announcement was made in the budget speech of 2017-18. Both these have been approved by the cabinet (one in May 2018 & the other in January 2019)\n\nAre 73 government medical colleges being upgraded?\n\n The third claim is that \u201873 government medical colleges being upgraded\u2019.\n\nThe website of PMSSY shows that a total of 75 government hospitals have been upgraded over the 5 phases of the scheme. More than 50 of these upgradations were approved during the UPA. Hence the claim is misleading.\n\nHave 1600 beds been added to AIIMS?\n\n The fourth claim is that \u20181675 hospital beds added in the functional AIIMS\u2019.\n\nThe six new functional AIIMS together have more than 4000 beds. But it is not clear as to how many of these were added during the current government.\n\nHas there been an increase in number of medical colleges and seats?\n\n The fifth claim is that \u2018total 92 medical colleges, resulted increase of 15,354 MBBS seats\u2019.\n\nThe annual report (2017-18) of the MoHFW states that \u2018at present, there are 479 medical colleges in the country, out of which 227 in Government and 252 are in private sector with annual admission capacity of 67,352 MBBS and 31415 PG\u2019.\n\nThe annual report (2013-14) of the MoHFW states that, \u2018at present, there are 387 medical colleges in the country out of which 181 are in government and 206 in private sector with annual admission capacity of about 51,979 MBBS and 24,196 Postgraduate students per year\u2019.\n\nIn other words, during the current government, 92 new medical colleges have been setup with an addition of more than 15000 MBBS seats.\n\nHave more than 12,000 PG seats been added?\n\n The last claim is that \u2018total 12,646 PG seats have been increased\u2019\n\nThe annual report (2017-18) of the MoHFW states that \u2018at present, there are 479 medical colleges in the country, out of which 227 in Government and 252 are in private sector with annual admission capacity of 67,352 MBBS and 31415 PG\u2019.\n\nThe annual report (2013-14) of the MoHFW states that, \u2018at present, there are 387 medical colleges in the country out of which 181 are in government and 206 in private sector with annual admission capacity of about 51,979 MBBS and 24,196 Postgraduate students per year\u2019.\n\nHence the total addition of PG seats during the current government (till the claim is made) is only more than 7000.\n\nThis story is part of a larger series on the 4-years of the Modi government.
