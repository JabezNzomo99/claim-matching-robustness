Supporters of Planned Parenthood point to mammograms to illustrate the organization\u2019s role in cancer screening and prevention for women.\n\nSupporters of Planned Parenthood often use slippery language to use this talking point. We previously gave Three Pinocchios to claims that Planned Parenthood \u201cprovides\u201d mammograms and other types of care for \u201cmillions of women.\u201d In light of Schumer\u2019s tweet, we reviewed the facts again.\n\nPlanned Parenthood does referrals for mammograms, and some affiliates host free mammography mobile vans for low-income and uninsured women. It does not have mammogram machines at its affiliate clinics. The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s list, updated weekly, of certified mammography facilities does not list any Planned Parenthood clinics.\n\nAmong all services, 7 percent were related to cancer screening and prevention and 13 percent were \u201cother women\u2019s health services\u201d (1.2 million pregnancy tests and 17,419 prenatal services). Out of the 682,208 total cancer screening and prevention services, 53 percent were breast exams or breast care. This is a clinical breast exam, checking for changes or lumps in women\u2019s breasts. If the doctor finds something abnormal or worth checking out, the patient is referred for a mammogram, which requires X-rays given at a licensed radiology facility.\n\nOther cancer screening and prevention services include Pap tests and HPV tests, both of which screen for cervical cancer and are directly administered at the clinics. In 2014, nearly 72,000 women had cancer detected early or had abnormalities identified through care through abnormal Pap tests or breast exams at a Planned Parenthood clinic, according to the organization.\n\nIn 2014, there were 363,803 breast exams at Planned Parenthood clinics, and about 11,000 (3 percent) resulted in a client referral for mammography and other specialized providers, according to Planned Parenthood. That means the number of mammogram referrals comprised less than 1 percent of total Planned Parenthood patients in 2014.\n\nMammograms do not reflect the core clients of the organization (women of reproductive age). Mammograms are recommended once a year for women 40 to 49, and every other year for women 50 to 74 years. Referrals are less commonly made for women under 40.\n\nIn 2014, about 7 percent of Planned Parenthood clients were women over 40, which is consistent with trends in prior years. So, when people talk about Planned Parenthood clients who need mammography referrals the most, they are referring to a small percentage of total patients.\n\nSupporters like Schumer argue that pulling federal funding \u2014 the majority of which is through Medicaid reimbursements for low-income women \u2014 means fewer women would use Planned Parenthood for family planning or reproductive care. As a result, fewer women would get free or low-cost breast exams, which could lead to mammography referrals.\n\nThose who want to pull federal funding from Planned Parenthood say \u201ccommunity health centers\u201d (usually referring to the more than 9,800 health center delivery sites in the federal Health Center Program) can absorb these services. Community health centers provided mammograms to 424,376 patients in 2013, and 470,976 in 2014, according to data compiled by the National Association of Community Health Centers. Some health centers administer mammograms on site and others make referrals, but the association did not have a more specific breakdown.\n\n\u201cThe tweet referenced the fact that each year Planned Parenthood doctors and nurses provide referrals for women to receive mammograms and hundreds of thousands more receive breast exams at Planned Parenthood clinics,\u201d said Matt House, Schumer\u2019s spokesman. \u201cIt is a fact that the TrumpCare proposal that defunds Planned Parenthood next year would eliminate access to critical screening and resources for women across the country.\u201d\n\nHouse said women do not always have federally qualified health centers as an alternative, and that Planned Parenthood \u201cis the only option for many women around the country.\u201d According to the Congressional Research Service, nearly two-thirds of U.S. counties have a federally qualified health center and 13 percent have a Planned Parenthood clinic, and 12 percent of all counties have both.\n\nSince 2012, The Fact Checker warned against politicians from language that implies women get mammograms at Planned Parenthood clinics. We gave Three Pinocchios to politicians who say Planned Parenthood \u201cprovides\u201d mammograms, and recommended using terminology that clearly shows Planned Parenthood does referrals. Schumer\u2019s wording, that women \u201cturn\u201d to Planned Parenthood, is somewhat vague, but it is still problematic and misleading.\n\nMoreover, Schumer\u2019s claim is problematic because it says \u201cmillions of women\u201d turn to Planned Parenthood for \u201cmammograms, maternity care, cancer screenings & more.\u201d He greatly exaggerates the universe of women who rely on Planned Parenthood for mammograms. In 2014, the most recent data, it made about 11,000 referrals for mammograms \u2014 less than 1 percent of the total number of patients that Planned Parenthood served that year.", "lang": "en"}
