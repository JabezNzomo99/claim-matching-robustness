While authorities in Illinois reported more than 160 people who suffered \u201csevere bleeding after using synthetic cannabinoids\u201d in a 2018 epidemic, this did not include bleeding from the eyes. The photo used to illustrate the article actually shows a Hawaiian woman suffering from a rare disease.\n\n\u201cSynthetic Marijuana Is Now Making People Bleed From Their Eyes,\u201d according to an article on Sick Chirpse, an online news website known for sensationalist headlines. A close-up photo of a woman\u2019s eyes drenched in blood illustrates the story for readers, 15,000 of whom shared the article on social media.\n\nAccording to the article, several individuals in the Midwestern state began to bleed from their eyes, a false claim the author supports with a broad statement from Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) director Nirav Shah on synthetic cannabinoids: \u201cThe recent cases of severe bleeding are evidence of the harm synthetic cannabinoids can cause.\u201d\n\nAn epidemic linked to synthetic marijuana did strike Illinois in the spring of 2018, and reports of \u201csevere bleeding\u201d in at least 160 people who consumed artificial marijuana, including some laced with rat poison, are real. However, no patient was reported bleeding from their eyes.\n\nA press release from the IDPH on April 24, 2018, 20 days after the Sick Chirpse article was published, specified that \u201cindividuals who have been sickened by the synthetic cannabinoids have reported coughing up blood, blood in the urine, severe bloody nose, bleeding gums, and/or internal bleeding.\u201d\n\nThe photo used to illustrate the article is also real, but has nothing to do with synthetic cannabis use. The photo is a close-up screenshot from a video of Linnie Ikeda, a Hawaiian woman affected by Gardner-Diamond Syndrome, a rare condition that causes unexplained bruises, and bouts of bleeding from the eyes at random. Ikeda\u2019s story was first broadcast on local television in May 2015.\n\nIn total, 164 cases of individuals experiencing severe bleeding following the consumption of a synthetic cannabinoid product were reported in Illinois as of May 30, 2018. People were treated with high doses of vitamin K for as long as six months in order to restore their body\u2019s ability to clot.", "lang": "en"}
