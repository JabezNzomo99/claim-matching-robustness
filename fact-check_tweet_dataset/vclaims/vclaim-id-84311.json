The purported front page has a main headline that says that 700,000 people in Hong Kong support a law that would allow extradition to China, above a photo of a mass protest in the city. The claim is false; the front page has been doctored from a 2018 edition of the Global Times, with the headlines, image, and date changed. The photo on the doctored front page actually shows a June 9, 2019 protest in Hong Kong opposing the extradition law.\n\nThe misleading image has been shared repeatedly on social media, for example in this Twitter post published June 9, 2019, which has been shared more than 100 times.\n\nThe image shows a purported front page of the Global Times newspaper dated June 9, 2019 which has a large photograph of two Hong Kong streets packed with people.\n\nThe main Chinese-language headline on the doctored front page, in red text, translates as: \u201c700,000 Hong Kong compatriots support the extradition bill amendment\u201d.\n\nA second headline in black Chinese text, running vertically down the right-hand side of the image, translates as: \u201cVictory of Chinese-style democracy\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading tweet:\n\nThe tweet\u2019s Chinese-language caption says, in part:\n\n\u201cOh my god, the Global Times can be shameless to this point? Absolutely beyond human imagination, it\u2019s clear Hong Kong people joined the parade to oppose the extradition bill, but why is it described as a supportive act? Crazy. The Global Times is crazy. Not only are they crazy, but they also want to drive the whole world crazy.\u201d\n\nOn June 9, 2019, a mass protest took place in Hong Kong against plans to allow extraditions to the Chinese mainland. Organisers said more than a million people took part; here is an AFP report about the event.\n\nDozens of people have shared the image of the doctored front page in other posts that also express anger towards the Global Times, for example here and here on Twitter, and here and here on Facebook.\n\nBut the purported front page has been doctored -- the text of the article under the headline in the image is not about Hong Kong or the proposed extradition law.\n\nIt is actually about an ex-CIA worker arrested for potential spy activities for China. The first two sentences of the article, translated to English, say:\n\n\u201cA former CIA worker was arrested at the airport when returning from Hong Kong to New York because he, after retirement, was still found illegally holding confidential information about CIA workers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis former Chinese American intelligence worker may be involved in a bigger conspiracy: since 2010, CIA's spy network in China has been systematically destroyed, and nearly 20 CIA informants have been killed or detained, and he may be the \u2018inner ghost\u2019 behind these things.\u201d\n\nA keyword search for Jerry Chun Shing Lee, the name of the ex-CIA worker mentioned in the article, led to international news reports such as this one by the New York Times on January 16, 2018, and this one by the South China Morning Post on January 17, 2018.\n\nLooking through Global Times front pages from that time period on Chinese online archive jdqu.com found this image of the edition dated January 18, 2018.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the original newspaper image:\n\nThe two headlines and the photo in the original image have been replaced in the doctored image. The original issue date has also been changed to June 9, 2019.\n\nThe original headline translates to English as: \u201cChina reluctantly involved as CIA catches their \u2018inner ghost\u2019\u201d.\n\nThe photo in the original article, together with the vertical headline on the right, is about a foreign ministers\u2019 meeting in Vancouver, Canada on safety issues in Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe image below compares screenshots of the doctored cover (L) and the original cover (R):\n\nThe image of a Hong Kong street packed with people on the doctored front page is very similar to this image, published in the South China Morning Post on June 10, 2019.\n\nThe SCMP image is captioned: \"Such was the size of the crowds, they were still flocking to the rallying point long after the first marchers had left, and the tail end of the rally was still in Causeway Bay as night fell.\"\n\nBelow is a comparison of the image in the doctored front page (L) and the SCMP image showing the June 9, 2019 anti-extradition protest in Hong Kong (R):", "lang": "en"}
