The article noted that the figures came from a state Department of Workforce Development report that was based on preliminary estimates from a monthly survey with sparse sample sizes and was subject to revision.\n\nThe same Journal Sentinel article reported that in February 2018, the state also set a record for the total number of people employed, with 3.07 million. It\u2019s worth noting that when Walker previously claimed, in June 2016, that more people were employed in Wisconsin than ever before, we rated his statement Mostly True, noting it didn\u2019t take into account population growth.\n\nNow to the role of Walker\u2019s reforms.\n\nWalker\u2019s campaign cited a number of policies that it links to the two statistics, including these.\n\nTax, regulation cuts: In 2015, roughly midway into Walker\u2019s time as governor, University of Wisconsin-Madison economist Noah Williams credited Walker\u2019s reductions in taxes and regulations for the favorable unemployment labor participation rates. Williams was described at the time as an informal adviser to Walker\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nManufacturing/agriculture credit: An April 2017 study by the same economist argued that the credit, which took effect in 2013, has \"accounted for a total gain\" of 42,000 jobs.\n\nFood stamp change: More than 25,000 people, according to Walker\u2019s Department of Health Services, gained employment after completing job training that was required under new rules imposed by the Walker administration.\n\nTo be sure, Wisconsin hasn\u2019t always had high marks during Walker\u2019s tenure.\n\nIn comparison to other states, Wisconsin hasn\u2019t fared well in rankings for job creation and new business creation. And the job growth wasn\u2019t enough to meet Walker\u2019s promise to create 250,000 jobs during his first term.\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted repeatedly in previous fact checks, the economy is affected by many factors, including national ones, and a governor plays an important -- but only limited -- role in a state\u2019s economy.\n\nMarquette University economics professor James McGibany reiterated that to us in assessing Walker\u2019s claim.\n\nMcGibany said it\u2019s very difficult to tease out how many jobs were created solely because of a policy change, or changes. For example, he said some of the increase in Wisconsin manufacturing jobs during Walker\u2019s tenure is likely due to the overall economy recovering from the 2008-\u201909 recession.\n\nSimilarly, some people who had been on food stamps and later found work likely did so because of the overall improvement in the economy, not specifically because of job training requirements. Moreover, McGibany said, low unemployment and high labor participation are being seen in most of the Midwest, including in states governed by Democrats as well as Republicans.\n\n\"The point is,\" he said, \"what is going on in Wisconsin is not the exception, but the rule for most of our neighboring states.\"\n\nIndeed, even Walker himself has acknowledged there are multiple factors at work.\n\nFor example, when asked about a week before his tweet why Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment rate is so low, he said it is \"a combination of things -- the biggest thanks for that are to the hard-working employers of the state, because I understand that government doesn\u2019t create jobs, people do \u2026 what we did was help create a better business climate.\"\n\nWalker says: \"Our bold reforms have Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment rate down to an all-time LOW of 2.9 percent, and the number of people working at an all-time HIGH!\"\n\nWalker is correct on the two statistics. But his various reforms can only be considered to be a contributing factor, at most, given many factors that affect the state\u2019s economy.", "lang": "en"}
