It took nearly 45 minutes, and he eventually died of a heart attack after officials stopped the execution.\n\nHe\u2019s not alone. of all executions by lethal injection are \"botched,\" or not done in line with protocol, according to an Amherst law professor. Each time, the death penalty debate reignites among legislators and the public about executions.\n\nSen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., went on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe May 1 to for the death penalty, despite the complication with Lockett\u2019s execution.\n\n\"I think it is a deterrent that does affect and impact people,\" he said. \"I\u2019ve given a lot of thought. I don\u2019t like it. I wish we put everybody that had such a history as this gentleman behind bars and working and doing things that would help them, but I haven\u2019t changed my position.\"\n\nWe decided to check the research to see if Coburn was right that the death penalty is a deterrent. Does the death penalty discourage crime?\n\nWe found there\u2019s no conclusive evidence to support any viewpoint, including Coburn's. We can\u2019t definitively say that the death penalty deters homicides, increases homicides or has no effect, so Coburn can't back up his point with widelyaccepted scientific evidence.\n\nDaniel Nagin, a public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon University, chaired the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Deterrence and the Death Penalty. He and his team were tasked with addressing whether or not available studies can prove that the death penalty serves as a deterrent for violent crime.\n\nIn 2012, he and his team published \" ,\" a report that sums up more than three decades worth of research:\n\n\"The committee concludes that the research to date on the effect of capital punishment on homicide is not informative about whether capital punishment decreases, increases, or has no effect on homicide rates. Therefore, the committee recommends that these studies not be used to inform deliberations requiring judgments about the effect of the death penalty on homicide. Consequently, claims that research demonstrates that capital punishment decreases or increases the homicide rate should not influence policy decisions about capital punishment.\"\n\nNagin found a few common problems with the existing research:\n\u2022 No comparison to deterrent effects of life imprisonment: Study authors often can\u2019t access the data they need from the government. An ideal deterrence study would examine whether people are more deterred by the death penalty than by other serious punishments.\n\u2022 No information on would-be murderers\u2019 perceptions: \"Deterrence is about how people are responding to their perceptions,\" Nagin said. Are potential criminals considering their chances of ending up on death row before they commit violent crimes? We don\u2019t know.\n\u2022 Statistical flaws: Nagin\u2019s committee determined that the research was so flawed, it couldn\u2019t be informative.\n\nHowever, Nagin said research does show that punishment for crime, in general, is a deterrent.\n\n\"It\u2019s the certainty of apprehension, not the severity of the ensuing consequences, that is the more effective deterrent,\" he said.\n\nThe Death Penalty Information Center, The Sentencing Project and other death penalty experts we contacted pointed to Nagin\u2019s report as the most authoritative literature on death penalty deterrence, but there are a significant number of people in the field who side with the studies Nagin and others have criticized.\n\nCoburn\u2019s office pointed us toward a by John Lott, founder of the Crime Prevention Research Center. Lott defended a group of studies that found that every execution saves 15 to 18 potential murder victims. They\u2019ve been for the way they count homicides, mistakes in methodology and making conclusions based on the very small pool of U.S. executions.\n\nIt could be quite some time before studies produce a widely respected answer to the deterrence question.\n\n\"The road forward is not easy,\" Nagin said.\n\nCoburn said, \"I think (the death penalty) is a deterrent that does affect and impact people.\" Overall, many experts say the existing research has limitations and doesn\u2019t clearly show support for or against the death penalty as a deterrent. So Coburn can't prove his viewpoint is correct. However, executions, along with prison sentences and other punishments for crime, do generally deter criminals.", "lang": "en"}
