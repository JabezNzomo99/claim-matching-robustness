Instead, the school will hold a virtual ceremony for live broadcast.\n\nThe decision was based on the recommendations of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control \u201cto protect the health of our graduates, their families, alumni, and faculty and staff,\u201d Amy Gutmann, the university president said in a message March 16.\n\n\u201cI regret that this semester has been upended in so many ways. But in our lifetime the world has not faced a challenge as unique and complicated as the one that we currently confront,\u201d she said.\n\nDominic Gregorio, a U. Penn senior, responded on March 18 in a UPENN Statesman article headlined, \u201cPenn stole our senior year over the common cold.\u201d\n\nGegorio accused the university of an \u201cover-the-top\u201d response to coronavirus and of \u201crobbing\u201d the 2020 class of \u201cthe only senior year we\u2019ll ever have.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish the economy and the academy were not so easily incapacitated by the common cold. I wish President Gutmann had heard the COVID-19 mortality rates in the U.S. were just above 0.1 percent, very similar to the seasonal flu, and acted like it,\u201d Gregorio wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he added, about spreading infection.\n\nClaims that COVID-19 is a common cold and that mortality rates are \u201cjust above 0.1 percent\u201d are false.\n\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 has been identified as SARS-CoV-2, or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. There is no vaccine or special treatment. After being discovered in December in China, COVID-19 by mid-March became a global pandemic \u2013 third in 100 years after the 1918-19 Spanish flu.\n\nThe number of people infected worldwide is approaching a half-million (451,355 as of March 25), and the death toll is past 20,000 (20,499).\n\nWhen describing the COVID-19, doctors, scientists and epidemiologists worldwide say they \u201chave never seen anything like it,\u201d and that it is \u201cnot like flu.\u201d\n\nThis story by National Public Radio spells out many of the differences between COVID-19, the common cold and seasonal flu.\n\nHere are eight of them:\n\u2022 COVID-19 is novel, or new. That means there's no vaccine, and it's unclear how it will manifest;\n\u2022 This strain of coronavirus appears to infect two to 2.5 people versus 1.3 with the flu, so coronavirus seems to be about twice as contagious as the flu;\n\u2022 Some 20% of coronavirus patients are in serious enough condition to go to the hospital, 10 times the number who wind up in the hospital because of the flu;\n\u2022 Hospital stays for the coronavirus are twice as long as for the flu;\n\u2022 About 8% of people get the flu every year. Some estimates are 25% to 50%, possibly up to 80%, could get the coronavirus without drastic actions being taken by individuals, states and municipalities and the federal government;\n\u2022 The coronavirus could be 10 times deadlier than the flu \u2014 about 0.1% who get flu die. It's estimated that about 1% of those who have gotten coronavirus have died from it;\n\u2022 There are treatments for the flu. There are no approved treatments for the coronavirus, despite the president's optimism for certain drugs, which are untested for coronavirus to this point; and\n\u2022 The flu tends to wane in warm weather, but it's too soon to count on that for coronavirus, which is thriving in warm, tropical places.\n\nLike Gregorio, hundreds of thousands of American students have expressed frustration about COVID-19\u2019s impact on campus life.\n\nEarly news coverage of the COVID-19 disease said it appeared most dangerous for older adults and people with chronic illnesses and presented a low risk of death for younger, healthy people.\n\nThat has changed with the U.S. epidemic data.\n\n\u201cToday I have a message for young people: You are not invincible, this virus could put you in hospital for weeks or even kill you. Even if you don\u2019t get sick, the choices you make about where you go could be the difference between life and death for someone else,\u201d Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyes, director general of the World Health Organization warned on March 21.", "lang": "en"}
