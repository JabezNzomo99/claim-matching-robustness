BJP leader Amit Shah presented the Prime Minister\u2019s BA degree certificate from DU and MA degree from Gujarat University following allegations by Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal over the PM\u2019s educational qualifications. Later in the day, the AAP, in a press conference, said that many discrepancies were found in the certificates.\u201d\n\nIn the above FAKE vs REAL collage, it is clear that the text on the paper held by Amit Shah was manipulated using photo editing software.\n\nHence, in conclusion, the above information establishes that the fact that the picture in question is morphed and the claim made is false.\n\nIf you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 88268 00707\n\nClick here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news", "lang": "en"}
