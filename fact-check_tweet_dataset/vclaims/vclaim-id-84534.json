They either support right-wing politics or spurt out hate while donning a Muslim identity, either of which, directly or indirectly, helps propel right-wing politics. Alt News had recently written a detailed account of one such fake Twitter account called giniromet. After the terror attack on Amarnath Yatris in which 7 pilgrims were killed, a fake Twitter account with the ID \u201c@ShaneMalwa\u201d with the name \u201cDr Abdul Vashisht\u201d has sent out several hateful tweets.\n\nThese tweets are designed to hurt Hindu sentiments and especially so after a terror attack in which Hindu pilgrims were killed. Even during the recent riots in Basirhat, Bengal, this Twitter account tried similar tactics.\n\nHow do we know this Twitter id is fake? We tracked the changes in this account\u2019s Twitter biography which shows how the person is assuming various identities, the new one clearly contradicting the old one. We also tracked the old deleted tweets from this account and the present tweets which show clear contradiction in terms of narrative and identity.\n\nIn this account\u2019s current biography, the person claims to be, \u201cFormer Hindu now Progressive Muslim.I am a Muslim scholar who tweets on Muslim issues in USA&India.Spreading Islam in USA & India is my goal.Phd in Computer Sc.\u201d\n\nThis same account at an earlier time used to have the following biography, \u201cProgress Hindu Muslim. My ancestors were Brahmins of Konkan who became Muslims. Bhakt of Pradhan Sevak Shri Narendra Modi. Lets save India from Islamization.\u201d\n\nThis same old Twitter bio also shows up in cached Google Search results.\n\nIn the present bio, this account claims to be \u201cSpreading Islam in USA & India is my goal\u201d while in its previous avatar stated, \u201cLets save India from Islamization\u201c. Such behaviour is typical of a fake account which changes narratives depending on the situation. This Twitter account which once used to uphold Hindu Rashtra is now upholding an Islamic state under Sharia. Some of the following tweets have been deleted and we retrieved them from various services that cache old tweets.\n\nIn the above tweets, this Twitter account clearly endorses the concept of Hindu Rastra. Lately, the account has completely changed its narrative and now wants Sharia and wants everybody to convert to Islam.\n\nAnother narrative that changed was this account going from \u201cJai Modi\u201d to \u201c56 inch has shrunk to 3 inches\u201c. The old Twitter biography also stated, \u201cBhakt of Pradhan Sevak Shri Narendra Modi\u201c.\n\nThe changing bio and the changing narrative in this account\u2019s tweets clearly shows that it is a fake account designed to instigate people depending on the situation. However, people are falling for this obviously fake account and are feeling offended.\n\nThis Twitter account is a repeat offender, tried to incite communal hatred during Bengal riots and now after the terror attack on Amarnath Yatris. Hopefully, the law enforcement agencies will track down the owner of this Twitter account and expose the person behind such dangerous propaganda.", "lang": "en"}
