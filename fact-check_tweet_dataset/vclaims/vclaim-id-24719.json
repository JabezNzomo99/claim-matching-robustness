Every official must be impeached and then removed separately, regardless of whether the president has been impeached.\n\nThis image was shared as Democrats consider whether to impeach President Donald Trump, with the meme claiming that per Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution, \u201cIf the president is impeached for treason, the vice president and all civil officers shall be removed.\u201d\n\nThis is not accurate.\n\nAdam Carrington, who teaches constitutional law at Hillsdale College, referred to this as \u201ca very bad reading\u201d of Article II, Section 4 in an email to The Daily Caller.\n\nWhat that section actually says is, \u201cThe President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\u201d\n\nThis means that any of the listed officials \u2013 president, vice president or civil officer \u2013 can be removed from office for treason. It does not mean, however, that if one of those officials is impeached, then all of them are removed simultaneously. The image misconstrues the use of the word \u201call\u201d in the original text.\n\n\u201c\u2018All\u2019 explains the extent of who can be impeached: any civil officer. It in no way attaches the removal of one officer to the impeachment of another,\u201d Carrington told the Caller.\n\nFurthermore, the processes of impeachment and removal occur separately, and impeachment can occur without removal from office.\n\nThe process begins in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority must vote to approve articles of impeachment. Then, the Senate holds a trial to determine if the charges leveled should lead to removal from office, which requires two-thirds support.\n\n\u201cThe House charges and the Senate gives a trial. Thus, like in courts of law, each person accused should have a distinct process of accusation and trial,\u201d Carrington said. \u201cIn the serious cases of impeachment proceedings, I don\u2019t know of a single one that involved more than one person at a time.\u201d\n\nOnly eight individuals have been both impeached by the House and removed from office by the Senate, all of them federal judges. Two presidents \u2013 Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton \u2013 were impeached by the House but not removed by the Senate.", "lang": "en"}
