He had already made a jab at Germany over breakfast.\n\nLONDON \u2014 President Trump ripped into Germany, a NATO ally, even before this year\u2019s summit meeting started in Brussels on Wednesday, using a longstanding disagreement on commercial and strategic relations with Russia. Departing from diplomatic protocol, Mr. Trump attacked Germany\u2019s relations with Russia over breakfast with NATO\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. \u201cGermany, as far as I\u2019m concerned, is captive to Russia because it\u2019s getting so much of its energy from Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re supposed to protect Germany but they\u2019re getting their energy from Russia.\u201d In a polite but firm response, Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Germany \u201ccan make our own policies and make our own decisions.\u201d\n\nHere are the facts and what experts say. Does Germany import a lot of gas from Russia? Yes, but not as much as the president said. Germany is the world\u2019s largest importer of natural gas, according to its Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources. The country with the largest natural gas resources is Russia. Nearly half the natural gas flowing through pipelines into Germany last year came from Russia. Like the rest of the European Union, Germany relies on Russian exports as its main supply of gas and crude oil. Natural gas is the fuel where Germany\u2019s proportion of imports from Russia is highest: it\u2019s about 40 percent for crude oil, and about 30 percent for coal.\n\nMr. Trump said Germany \u201cwill be getting 60 to 70 percent of their energy from Russia.\u201d In fact, that\u2019s the total amount of its energy needs that Germany gets from any foreign source, and even its gas market is highly diversified. Most of the rest of the gas it imports comes from the Netherlands and Norway. A new branch of Russia\u2019s Nord Stream pipeline, mentioned by Mr. Trump, might push up the proportion of Germany\u2019s energy that comes from there, but probably not to the figure he gave.\n\nImport figures alone cannot show dependence on a particular natural gas supplier, according to Jonathan Stern, founder of the Natural Gas Research Program at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. \u201cEurope, particularly northwestern Europe, has turned into a gas-trading region,\u201d he said on Wednesday, adding that nobody could say where exactly the molecules coming in from a single country were used. European Union countries have increased their consumption of natural gas in the past five years, and tend to favor pipeline-supplied gas over liquefied natural gas, which would allow a greater choice of suppliers. But they are also storing larger reserves to be more resilient if Russia cuts the gas off, as it did in 2009. Germans view Russia more favorably than Americans do. And United States governments have been complaining about Germany\u2019s dependence on Russian gas for years, even if Mr. Trump has done so more bluntly. But Germany has endorsed tough sanctions on Russia even when they looked likely to hurt German business, and German companies have gone along. Last year, the German manufacturer Siemens stopped delivery of power plant turbines to a Russian partner when it emerged that it was transporting them into the disputed territory of Crimea. \u201cGermany refuses to see that large energy projects also have a political dimension,\u201d said Marco Giuli, an analyst at the European Policy Center. \u201cFor the German side there is no contradiction, the general take in Germany is that energy policy is a full component of commercial, economic policy and the decision should be entirely left to commercial actors.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
