But no evidence has emerged to back up Trump, and, in fact, his public remarks at the time indicate he was a supporter of the war.\n\n\u201cI was visited by people from the White House asking me to sort of, could I be silenced because I seem to get a disproportionate amount of publicity. I mean, I was very strong, though: \u2018You\u2019re going to destabilize the Middle East,\u2019 \u201d Trump told Fox News on Oct. 6, 2015. In a GOP primary debate on Sept. 16, Trump made a similar claim: \u201cA delegation was sent to my office to see me because I was so vocal about it.\u201d\n\nSo, Trump\u2019s original claim was he was getting tons of publicity with his opposition to the war. But we determined there was no White House visit. That should have been no surprise, given that in a 2000 book, Trump wrote that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, and, if an attack is needed, \u201cit is madness not to carry the mission to its conclusion.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Trump\u2019s public comments generally were in favor of the war. Asked about whether he was in favor of the invasion, Trump told Howard Stern on Sept. 11, 2002: \u201cYeah, I guess so. You know, I wish the first time it was done correctly.\u201d On Jan. 28, 2003, he expressed impatience in an interview with Neil Cavuto on Fox News: \u201cEither you attack or you don\u2019t attack.\u201d On March 21, 2003, the day after the invasion, Trump told Fox News: \u201cIt looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint.\u201d\n\nAs the gap between Trump\u2019s claim and the reality widened, he dropped the fib that he was visited by a White House delegation and began to rewrite the record of conversations. For instance, he recast the Cavuto interview as showing he was more interested in the economy than the war. He also has started to claim that he privately expressed his opposition to the war in conversations with Sean Hannity and others.\n\n\u201cThousands of New Jersey Muslims celebrated the 9/11 attacks\u201d\n\nThis eventually became a problem for Trump: There was no coverage at the time, because the events he described had never happened. There had been rumors that a half-dozen teenagers may have danced in front of a library in South Paterson, but that had never been confirmed.\n\nSo what did Trump do? He cited even the tiniest mention of a rumor as evidence he was right. He touted a sentence that appeared in the 15th paragraph of an article that appeared on Page 6 of The Washington Post, saying authorities had questioned \u201ca number of people\u201d who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks. The Trump campaign also posted snippets of video clips from a local CBS newscast concerning the arrest of eight people after reports they had allegedly celebrated the attacks.\n\nTrump falsely claimed that Obama\u2019s grandmother said she watched his birth in Kenya, that no one knew what hospital Obama was born in, that there are no records showing Obama was born in Hawaii, that Obama did not produce a legitimate copy of his birth certificate and that notices of Obama\u2019s birth in two Hawaiian newspapers were placed as part of an apparent plot to establish he was a U.S. citizen.\n\nThese statements were problematic when Trump suddenly decided this month to declare that Obama was indeed born in the United States. So rather than admit he was wrong, Trump has sought to pin the blame on Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign, saying it first raised questions about Obama\u2019s birth. During the first presidential debate on Sept. 26, Trump suggested the 2008 Clinton campaign was \u201cpressing very hard\u201d to find the birth certificate.\n\nAgain, Trump grasps at straws to deflect from his own falsehoods. Trump twisted a comment by Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign manager, Patti Solis Doyle, to suggest the Clinton campaign pressed the birther story during the long battle for the Democratic nomination. Instead, Doyle had reported that a volunteer coordinator in Iowa was fired in December 2007 after forwarding an email perpetuating the birther tale \u2014 which is the opposite of what Trump claims.\n\nTrump also seized on a statement by James Asher, formerly of the McClatchy Washington bureau, that during the 2008 campaign longtime Clinton ally Sidney Blumenthal \u201cstrongly urged\u201d him to \u201cinvestigate the exact place of President Obama\u2019s birth, which he suggested was in Kenya.\u201d A McClatchy reporter in Africa determined there was nothing to the claim, and no story was ever printed. Blumenthal, who at the time was not on the campaign payroll, insists that Asher\u2019s claim is false; Asher has not provided notes or other contemporaneous material that would back up his memory.", "lang": "en"}
