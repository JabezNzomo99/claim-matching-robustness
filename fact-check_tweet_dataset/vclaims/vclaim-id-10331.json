The new barriers are not concrete and not like any of Trump\u2019s wall prototypes.\n\nHas Trump started building the wall between USA & Mexico?\n\nSince the omnibus spending bill for fiscal year 2018 passed in late March, President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed his long-promised wall is now under construction.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already started building it,\u201d Trump said in West Virginia on April 5. \u201cWe have a billion-six. We\u2019ve started building it and fixing miles and miles of wall that\u2019s already up \u2014 and fence. And we\u2019re going to have our wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve started building the wall,\u201d he proclaimed in remarks with Baltic leaders on April 3.\n\n\u201cWe started building our wall,\u201d he said in Ohio on March 30. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of it. We started. We started. We have $1.6 billion, and we\u2019ve already started. \u2026 We have $1.6 billion toward the wall, and we\u2019ve done the planning.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, founder of the House Freedom Caucus, said of the omnibus bill, \u201cThe one thing we don\u2019t fund is the one issue we all campaigned on \u2014 a border security wall \u2014 and that is not in the legislation.\u201d\n\nAnd here\u2019s House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s version of what the bill does: \u201cDemocrats won explicit language restricting border construction to the same see-through fencing that was already authorized under current law.\u201d\n\nThose seemingly conflicting statements may lead to some confusion. One of our readers asked, \u201cHas Trump started building the wall between USA & Mexico?\u201d\n\nThe short answer is that the omnibus bill funds some new fencing, though far less than Trump had hoped it would. The new barriers are also not the kind of solid, concrete wall Trump once described during the campaign. Nor is it anything like any of the prototypes Trump visited in mid-March.\n\nTrump and others in his administration are calling what is going up \u201cthe wall.\u201d The omnibus describes it as \u201cfencing.\u201d Some may say that\u2019s a matter of semantics, and indeed many officials and journalists use the terms interchangeably. But Trump has often insisted there is a difference between a fence and wall, and that he\u2019d be building a wall.\n\nFinally, Trump officials say the omnibus will fund about 100 miles of \u201cnew\u201d wall, but most of that is replacing existing border fencing deemed inadequate or dilapidated.\n\nLet\u2019s take a deeper look at what the bill does and does not fund for barriers along the border with Mexico. And then let\u2019s dig deeper into what Trump promised.\n\nOn March 23, Trump signed the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill (also known as the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018), though he said there \u201care a lot of things that I\u2019m unhappy about in this bill.\u201d\n\nAlthough Trump had asked for $25 billion for wall construction, the bipartisan spending bill provides what Trump called only an \u201cinitial down payment\u201d of $1.6 billion in funding. But even that sum comes with significant strings attached.\n\nHere\u2019s what that $1.6 billion is for (see Section 230, starting on page 673):\n\u2022 $445 million for \u201cprimary pedestrian levee fencing\u201d in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\u2022 $196 million for \u201cprimary pedestrian fencing\u201d in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nThe bill further states that the money can only be used to build \u201coperationally effective designs deployed as of the date of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, [May 5, 2017] such as currently deployed steel bollard designs, that prioritize agent safety.\u201d\n\nReaders may recall Trump on March 13 toured eight wall prototypes \u2014 which you can see here \u2014 that he had put out to bid early in his presidency. The language in the omnibus bill precludes funding for any of those designs.\n\nIn a March 30 briefing, Customs and Border Protection Acting Deputy Commissioner Ronald D. Vitiello said the spending bill will fund about 100 miles of \u201cborder wall system,\u201d though he added that \u201cdoes not fully fund our needs in the most critical locations.\u201d\n\nAccording to Vitiello, the construction near San Diego will include 14 miles of \u201cnew border wall,\u201d replacing \u201cold, dilapidated [Vietnam War-era helicopter] landing mats in favor of a steel bollard wall\u201d and replacing 14 miles of secondary barriers.\n\nIn Calexico, California, the federal government will replace two miles of pedestrian barrier with \u201ca new 30-foot border wall,\u201d he said. In Santa Teresa, New Mexico, the government will build 20 miles of border wall, he said. According to the Washington Examiner, the new barriers in Santa Teresa will replace \u201cthree-foot-tall posts and a taller mesh fence.\u201d\n\nVitiello said the government will build four miles of new border wall in El Paso, Texas, and 35 new gates along a 55-mile stretch of existing border wall in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nFinally, Vitiello said, the Department of Homeland Security will replace 47 miles of \u201cdilapidated border fencing with new border wall system in various locations along the southwest border.\u201d Also in the Rio Grande Valley, he said, it plans to build 25 miles of new levee wall in Hidalgo County, and eight miles of \u201cnew border wall system\u201d in Starr County, Texas. All of that is made possible by funding in the 2018 spending bill, he said.\n\nBy our count, that comes to less than 40 miles of new barrier where there wasn\u2019t any before.\n\nAlthough most of the new barrier will replace old or ineffective fencing, Vitiello said, \u201cI would say that it\u2019s all new because there\u2019s a different design going in. It\u2019s replacing stuff that is unsuitable, the dilapidated wall, this old landing mat fence. It doesn\u2019t serve our needs anymore.\u201d\n\nThe president would ultimately like to have 1,000 miles of barrier, Vitiello said, and there is currently 654 miles of fencing. So the funding bill leaves the president well short of his goal.\n\nOn March 28, Trump tweeted photos from a briefing \u201con the start of our Southern Border WALL!\u201d\n\nThe pictures show steel bollards, which look like a comb, and provide a barrier that border patrol agents can see through \u2014 a feature that Trump has repeatedly said over the last nine months is critical for enforcement purposes.\n\nThat raises the question, though: Is the barrier funded through the omnibus a wall or a fence? At one time, that distinction was important to Trump.\n\nAccording to Vocabulary.com, \u201cThe difference between a fence and a wall is that you can almost always see through a fence, at least to some degree, while a wall is solid.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, then what is going up is fence. But, to be fair, many politicians, media figures and even border experts often use the terms wall and fence interchangeably.\n\nAnd so has Trump \u2014 at times.\n\nPrior to announcing his presidential candidacy, for example, Trump said in an interview with CBN News in May 2015, \u201cI would build a wall like nobody can build a wall.\u201d But later he added, \u201cNobody can build a fence like me \u2026 I build great buildings all over the world.\u201d\n\nBy the time Trump announced his candidacy for president on June 16, 2015, he had settled on the nomenclature: wall.\n\nTwo days later, in an interview on Fox News, Sean Hannity said, \u201cYou said you \u2014 you would build a fence \u2014 nobody could build a better fence than Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nIn August of that year, Trump again stressed that he was proposing a wall, not a fence, as he made very clear in a tweet attacking Republican primary opponent Jeb Bush, who criticized Trump\u2019s plan for a border \u201cfence.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not a fence, Jeb,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s a WALL, and there\u2019s a BIG difference!\u201d\n\nSo Trump saw a difference between fences and walls. But he did not explain exactly what those differences were.\n\nWe could find only one instance where he described the details of the wall as a solid structure, as he described laying down \u201cprecast planks.\u201d It came during a campaign speech in August 2015 in New Hampshire. It\u2019s height? Trump pointed to the ceiling of the auditorium and said, \u201cHigher.\u201d\n\nIn a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview shortly after his election, Trump continued to distinguish between walls and fences, and allowed that fences might be appropriate in places.\n\nOn March 17, 2017, Customs and Border Protection issued two requests for proposals \u201cto acquire multiple conceptual wall designs with the intent to construct multiple prototypes.\u201d One RFP was for a \u201csolid concrete border wall,\u201d and the second RFP was for \u201cother border wall.\u201d For the \u201cother border wall,\u201d the RPF says: \u201cPrototypes constructed in response to this solicitation must offer designs that are alternatives to reinforced solid concrete walls (i.e. no solid concrete external faces).\u201d\n\nThat summer, Trump began talking about the need to be able to see through the wall.\n\nSpeaking with reporters on Air Force One on July 14, 2017, Trump said, \u201cOne of the things with the wall is you need transparency. \u2026 You have to be able to see through it. In other words, if you can\u2019t see through that wall \u2014 so it could be a steel wall with openings, but you have to have openings because you have to see what\u2019s on the other side of the wall.\u201d\n\nIn an interview on Fox News in November, Trump said the wall would be drawn from one of the prototypes, and he again stressed the need to be able to see through the wall. \u201cYou know, you think we\u2019re going to build a nice, simple concrete wall, but it\u2019s not that simple.\u201d\n\nThe eight companies were ultimately chosen to build prototypes 18 to 30 feet tall. Half were made primarily of reinforced concrete; the other four were made out of \u201cother materials.\u201d After viewing them in March, Trump said, \u201csome work very well; some don\u2019t work so well. When we build, we want to build the right thing.\u201d\n\nAgain, the funding in the omnibus appropriations bill precludes construction of the prototype designs. The bill funds about 100 miles of border barrier in various places, according to Customs and Border Protection. That\u2019s far less than what Trump said he intends to ultimately build. And much of that is replacement for existing fencing that is dilapidated or inadequate. The spending bill funds nearly $1.6 billion worth of what it refers to as \u201cfencing.\u201d Trump now calls that \u201cwall.\u201d But he didn\u2019t always think those were the same thing.\n\nWhitehouse.gov.
