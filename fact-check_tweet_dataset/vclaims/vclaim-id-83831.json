The claim is false and a spokesman for Indonesia\u2019s prison system told AFP that Purnama, popularly known as Ahok, is still in jail.\n\nThe post, which has been shared more than 2,600 times since it was posted on Facebook on November 29, contains an image showing Ahok with Indonesian politician Megawati Sukarnoputri.\n\nThe post\u2019s caption says: \u201cFinally, Mr. Ahok is freed. To all fans of former Jakarta governor Ahok, let\u2019s visit him, today he is released from jail and soon will re-enter politics to fight corruptors.\u201d\n\nIn May 2017, Purnama was sentenced for two years in prison for insulting Islam in a comment he made when he was unsuccessfully seeking reelection as Jakarta governor.\n\nHere is AFP\u2019s story about his conviction.\n\nThe misleading Facebook post was flooded with comments celebrating Ahok\u2019s release.\n\nOne comment says: \u201cWelcome back my hero. I love you full Mr. Ahok. Just fight the elite who robbed people\u2019s money. Stay healthy, Mr. Ahok.\u201d\n\nAde Kusmanto, a spokesman for Indonesia\u2019s directorate general for prisons, told AFP that Purnama was still in jail.\n\nThe politician is likely to be released in January 2019 -- five months ahead of the set end of his prison term -- thanks to a series of sentence reductions, Kusmanto said.\n\n\u201cAhok was given sentence reductions for behaving well and having served more than six months of his term,\u201d Kusmanto said.\n\n\"He obtained sentence reduction of three months and fifteen days. Thus, as the prison term began on May 9, 2017, he is likely to be released in January 2019.\"\n\nIndonesian media have reported extensively on Purnama's case but no Indonesian media have mentioned Purnama being released from prison.\n\nHowever, popular news outlets like Tempo and Detik have reported on his likely release on January 24, 2019.\n\nNana Riwayatie, Purnama's step sister, told AFP that he was still in prison.\n\n\"Yes, he's still jailed at the Mako,\" she said, referring to a detention centre turned high-security prison at Indonesia's national police mobile brigade headquarters, or Mako Brimob, where Purnama is serving his sentence.", "lang": "en"}
