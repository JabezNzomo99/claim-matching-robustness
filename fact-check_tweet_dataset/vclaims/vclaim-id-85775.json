That to get his nominees in place would take over nine years, to get them confirmed.\u201d\n\n \u2014 Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), remarks to reporters, April 24\n\nThere is no doubt that it has taken Trump longer to get his nominees confirmed compared with his recent predecessors. For Trump, it has been 85 days on average, compared with 65 for Barack Obama and 44 for George W. Bush.\n\nIf you file cloture on Monday, the cloture vote ripens on Wednesday (the first day of session after an \u201cintervening day\u201d). Then, if cloture is invoked, up to 30 hours of debate time is available, which takes the Senate into Thursday afternoon. In other words, it can take four Senate days for one nominee.\n\nSo when Trump said it would take nine years, that was based on 1,122 potential nominations. Assuming each nominee is subjected to 30 hours of debate, that\u2019s 33,660 hours, or 1,402 days. But the Senate is not in session every day \u2014 only about 150 days a year. So that works out to almost 9.4 years, assuming that all the Senate did was work on nominations subject to a cloture vote.\n\nSchumer\u2019s office said The Fact Checker should not have assumed that every nomination going forward would be subject to a cloture vote. (We did not, since we also tried to add time for legislation.) Matt House, spokesman for Schumer, provided documentation showing that 432 of Trump\u2019s nominees have been confirmed, 314 of them by voice vote. In other words, about 1 in 4 have been subject to a cloture vote.\n\nSo, assuming 1,122 potential nominations, that means 281 nominees would be subject to a cloture vote. Under the same formula as before, we end up with 2.3 years. But there\u2019s a wrinkle: Previously, we had not counted intervening days, so when you add those, you end up with 4.2 years, or beyond the end of Trump\u2019s term. (Counting intervening days also would make Trump\u2019s nine-year calculation much higher.)\n\nWe also checked how many nominations have received Senate confirmation in 2018. We counted nine in January, 33 in February, 37 in March and eight so far in April. That works out to 87, or about 261 a year. At that rate, it would take 4.3 years for all of his potential nominations \u2014 or, again, beyond Trump\u2019s term.\n\nHouse noted that many of the nominations have cleared through voice votes, but it\u2019s striking how long some took. Seven of the nominations approved in March were submitted in August, July and even June. Not all this is the fault of the Democrats, of course, as Republicans also place holds on nominations. Republicans also control the committee and floor schedules.\n\nHouse\u2019s objection is that Trump is wrong when he says that Democrats are \u201cslow walking\u201d all of his nominations \u2014 and that Trump is wrong to say, as he asserted at the news conference, that \u201cDemocrats are taking 30 hours per person, they\u2019re taking the maximum time.\u201d Democrats will sometimes give yield-back time and do not take the full 30 hours; they do not file cloture on every nominee.\n\nIn any case, at the current pace it\u2019s unlikely that Trump will have all of his nominees confirmed by the end of this term. The president offered a theoretical number of nine years, and the numbers add up if one assumes that the number of nominations subject to cloture will increase. But the result still isn\u2019t pretty if you do the math based on previous performance.", "lang": "en"}
