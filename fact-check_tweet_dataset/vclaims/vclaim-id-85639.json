Then she said something that stopped us in our tracks. She added that \u201cwe\u201d spend less on young children than any other developed nation. \u201cIt\u2019s just a fact,\u201d she said.\n\nThe claim seemed like a non sequitur. One minute Trump is explaining how the GOP tax cuts would help middle-income families pay for child care, and the next she is comparing the United States to other high-income countries, many of which offer a broader array of social programs and levy high taxes to pay for them. It\u2019s a talking point we don\u2019t expect to hear from prominent Republicans.\n\nPart of what makes Trump\u2019s statement perplexing is that she didn\u2019t initially specify who, exactly, spends so little on preschool-aged children. In terms of the context of the conversation, it seemed she was referring to the U.S. government. Without government investment in families, the cost of raising kids is a burden for many families, Trump argues, positioning the tax plan, which would expand the child tax credit and maintain the dependent-care credit, as a means to manage the cost.\n\nWe don\u2019t try to play \u201cgotcha\u201d with political figures, so we reached out to the White House for clarity on Trump\u2019s spending claim. A White House official said Trump was referencing a Council of Economic Advisers report that found that the United States spends less on child care and early-childhood education as a percentage of gross domestic product than almost every country in the developed world. The CEA provides the president with research and advice to support the formulation of economic policy.\n\nWe reached out to a CEA staff member from the previous administration, and he pointed us to a 2016 white paper on the economic benefits of public investment in young children. The report details at length how public investments in children ramp up once kids enter school, leaving families with younger children without much-needed support. The argument is similar to the one Trump makes on the Carlson show, except for one key thing: The report calls for greater spending on pre-kindergarten programs, not tax cuts.\n\nThe OECD report on which the CEA white paper is based notes that \u201clocal governments often play a key role in financing, and sometimes provide childcare services.\u201d But in countries such as the United States, spending at the state and local level is \u201cnot properly captured in the data and it is much more difficult to get a good view of public support for childcare across such countries.\u201d\n\nIn the United States, that means state-funded pre-kindergarten programs wouldn\u2019t be counted. As of the 2016-2017 school year, 43 out of 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, offer state-funded pre-kindergarten programs. According to a report by the Education Commission of the States, funding for these programs has increased by 47 percent over the past five years, and by nearly 7 percent since the previous school year. The commission estimates that in 2017 states spent nearly $7.6 billion on pre-kindergarten programs.\n\nWe reached back out to the White House to confirm the 2016 white paper was in fact Trump\u2019s source. The official confirmed. And based on this report, Trump\u2019s claim is in the ballpark. The United States clearly lags behind most developed countries in spending on kids 5 and younger. But that doesn\u2019t answer the question of how tax cuts would help boost public investment.\n\nThere are a few problems with this premise. For one, the tax cut for families Trump touts isn\u2019t really a tax cut for many families, as we\u2019ve pointed out in a previous column. More than 40 percent of families with children would see a tax increase under the House GOP plan. And even if the tax cuts would keep money in families\u2019 pocketbooks, the increased cash wouldn\u2019t translate into increased public spending on child care.\n\nSomewhere along the line, Trump decided tax cuts could be that win-win. Her political views might help to explain how Sojourner\u2019s ideas got co-opted to suit an alternative political agenda. During the Republican National Convention in July 2016, Trump laid out her party affiliation: \u201cLike many of my fellow millennials, I do not consider myself categorically Republican or Democrat,\u201d she said. \u201cMore than party affiliation, I vote based on what I believe is right, for my family and for my country. Sometimes it\u2019s a tough choice.\u201d\n\nTrump claims that the United States spends less than other developed nations on children ages 5 and younger. We are generally skeptical of sweeping statements like this, but Trump\u2019s claim caught our eye because it seemed better suited for an argument in favor of increased government spending on social programs. Yet Trump uses the factoid to advocate for the GOP tax plan, which she says would help middle-income families pay the high cost of child care.\n\nTurns out, the confusion stems from the fact that Trump pulled her talking point from an Obama-era CEA white paper advocating for expanding pre-kindergarten programs. And even though the white paper found that the United States spends less than almost every OECD country on early-childhood education, the proposed tax cuts wouldn\u2019t boost the United States\u2019 rank. And more important, the tax cuts Trump cites could increase taxes on 40 percent of families with children.", "lang": "en"}
