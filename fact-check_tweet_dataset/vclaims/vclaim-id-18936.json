Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral message is fake.\n\nThe viral post on social media claims that cracking the knuckles can lead to arthritis.\n\nVishvas News started its investigation by searching medical reports on whether cracking the knuckles cause arthritis.\n\nAs per US National Library of Medicine, the relation of habitual knuckle cracking to osteoarthrosis with functional impairment of the hand has long been considered an old wives\u2019 tale without experimental support.\n\nAs per a report by Harvard Medical School, Harvard University, cracking your knuckles may aggravate the people around you, but it probably won\u2019t raise your risk for arthritis.\n\nAs per Johns Hopkins Arthritis Center, there is no evidence that cracking knuckles causes any damage such as arthritis in the joints. However, a couple of reports in the medical literature are available associating knuckle cracking with injury of the ligaments surrounding the joint or dislocation of the tendons ( attachments of muscles to bones) which improved with conservative treatment.\n\nAs per the Library of Congress, scientists explain that synovial fluid present in your joints acts as a lubricant. The fluid contains the gases oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. When you pop or crack a joint, you stretch the joint capsule. Gas is rapidly released, which forms bubbles. In order to crack the same knuckle again, you have to wait until the gases return to the synovial fluid.\n\nVishvas News spoke to Dr. Ramankant Aggrawal, Orthopedic Doctor, Fortis Heart Institute and Research Centre. He said: \u201cNo, cracking knuckles do not cause any damage such as arthritis in the joints. When a joint moves, the tendon\u2019s position changes and moves slightly out of place. You may hear a snapping sound as the tendon returns to its original position. In addition, your ligaments may tighten as you move your joints. This commonly occurs in your knee or ankle, and can make a cracking sound.\u201d\n\nThe post claiming that cracking the knuckles cause arthritis is fake.\n\nKnowing the truth is your right.
