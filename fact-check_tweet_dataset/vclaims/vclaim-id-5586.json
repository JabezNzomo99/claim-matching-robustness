He said the U.S. needs to accept immigrants who \u201cdon\u2019t want to destroy us, that don\u2019t want to go to a club where you have innocent people, and where you had no guns on the other side.\u201d He said that someone at the club shooting back at Mateen could have prevented at least some of the deaths of the 49 people killed.\n\nTrump, June 15: If some of those great people that were in that club that night had guns strapped to their waist or strapped to their ankle, and if the bullets were going in the other direction, aimed at this guy who was just open target practice, you would\u2019ve had a situation folks, which would have been always horrible, but nothing like the carnage that we all as a people suffered this weekend.\n\nHe made a similar claim days before, during a June 13 interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d At that point, the interviewer, CNN news anchor Alisyn Camerota, told Trump that an armed security guard was at the scene of the shooting.\n\nTrump, June 13: Gun owners even more than ever, need to be able to protect themselves. And by the way, if you had some guns in that club the night that this took place, if you had guns on the other side, you wouldn\u2019t have had the tragedy that you had. If people in that room had guns with the bullets flying in the opposite direction right at him \u2026 Camerota: But there was. But Mr. Trump, there was an armed security \u2014 there was an armed security guard. Trump: \u2026 right at his head, you wouldn\u2019t have had the same tragedy that you ended up having. And nobody even knows how bad that tragedy is, because I think probably the numbers will get bigger and bigger and worse and worse. I hear the injured are so gravely injured. But if you had guns in that room, if you had \u2014 even if you had a number of people having them strapped to their ankle or strapped to their waist, where bullets could have flown in the other direction right at him, you wouldn\u2019t have had the same kind of a tragedy.\n\nTrump either ignored Camerota or didn\u2019t hear her before her satellite feed cut out.\n\nGruler, a 15-year veteran of the Orlando Police Department, was at the club, in uniform, working security. He traded gunfire with Mateen before the gunman made his way further into the club. That\u2019s according to the Orlando Police Department.\n\nIn addition, news reports said that two of the responding officers, who were nearby and arrived at the scene not long after, also fired at Mateen before he retreated to a club bathroom with hostages. That was a few hours before police used an armored vehicle to rescue hostages from the bathroom, and then shot and killed Mateen.\n\nThe Orlando Sentinel described the shootout between the officers and Mateen:\n\nTrump is free to argue that the situation might have turned out differently had more people inside the club been armed. However, Trump\u2019s statement that there were \u201cno guns on the other side\u201d is wrong. There was at least one armed person on site, a veteran police officer working security, who shot at the suspected gunman.", "lang": "en"}
