It then quoted statistics on emigration.\n\n\u201cOne study\u201d, it said, estimated that more than 520,000 South Africans emigrated from 1989 to 2003 \u2013 and the number was growing at 9% a year.\n\nSome 120,000 of them had professional qualifications, making up \u201cabout 7% of the total stock of professionals employed in South Africa\u201d. The number of skilled workers leaving,\n\n, \u201cis more than eight times\u201d the number who immigrated to South Africa in the same period.\n\nas people whose jobs require \u201ca high level of professional knowledge, skills and experience\u201d.\n\n\u2018Wide acceptance\u2019 that there are underestimates\n\non South Africa\u2019s immigration policy. It was co-authored by Dr Matthew Stern, now MD of consultancy\n\n, and G\u00e1bor Szalontai, the head of risk at data and analytics company\n\ncollects some data on people immigrating to South Africa and self-declared emigrants leaving to settle elsewhere.\n\nInformation on self-declared emigrants was collected on the B1-117 form. Until 2003 it was compulsory for emigrants leaving from the country\u2019s three international airports (Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town) to complete it.\n\nBut Stern and Szalontai said it was\n\nthat the number of people leaving was underestimated, and gave two key reasons for this. Some were reluctant to list emigration as their reason for travel \u2013 to reduce administrative hassles, for example \u2013 while others didn\u2019t plan to leave permanently.\n\non the country\u2019s migration patterns in 2003\n\n\u201cit is not always feasible to accurately verify\u201d the details filled in on the B1-117 form. The statistics in the report are therefore for \u201cself-declared emigration, which is different from actual emigration\u201d.\n\nIn their study, Stern and Szalontai\n\nto better understand how many people are leaving South Africa, \u201cmost researchers\u201d supplement Stats SA\u2019s data with statistics from the emigrants\u2019 destination countries.\n\nTheir study focused on the UK, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, identified as the main receiving countries. They estimated that from 1989 to 2003 the five countries received almost\n\nof all emigrants from South Africa.\n\nThey found that Stats SA had significantly undercounted emigration numbers.\n\nBut how many of these emigrants were professionals?\n\nStats SA\u2019s migration data was categorised by employment and included a \u201cprofessional\u201d category. Stern and Szalontai calculated that, according to Stats SA data, 29,142 professionals emigrated from South Africa from 1989 to 2003.\n\nBut their study found the number was closer to\n\nIn that period 14,221 people immigrated to South Africa, according to Stats SA.\n\nDo these migration trends hold up today?\n\n\u201cIt is of course completely inappropriate to use data from 1989 to 2003 (a time of extreme political uncertainty and change) to comment on current emigration trends,\u201d Stern told Africa Check.\n\nData on emigration was also \u201chard to come by\u201d because of insufficient reporting, he added.\n\nComplicating the picture is that South Africa relaxed its reporting requirements in 2003 after the\n\nbecame law. Since then the passport barcodes of South Africans leaving or arriving home are\n\nat ports of exit or entry, as they were previously. And South Africans leaving the country don\u2019t have to fill in the departure form any more.\n\nWhat does Stat SA\u2019s most recent data show? Not much\n\n\n\n Stats SA\u2019s most recent data on emigrants comes from the , Angela Ngyende, the agency\u2019s director of census content development and products, told Africa Check. \n\n\n\n measuring emigration is a challenge, because many of the people leaving don\u2019t declare their departure to authorities and there\u2019s no way to force them to do so. \n\n\n\n But the community survey still has \u201csome figures on areas of interest\u201d, Ngyende said. It estimates that South Africans emigrated in the years 2006 to 2016. \n\n\n\n That this is an undercount is highly possible, the survey says. The number only includes people who still have family in South Africa, who can thus confirm the emigration. If a whole family emigrates, they are not counted. \n\n\n\n the number of people who said they were born outside South Africa. It came to a total of 888,563 from 2006 to 2016. . But their occupation was not recorded, Ramadimetja Matji, director of health and vital stats at Stats SA, told Africa Check. \n\n\n\n The agency also did not record the race of people born outside South Africa, Matji said.\n\nThe data situation is a \u201cminefield\u201d, Angel Jones, CEO of\n\n, told Africa Check. She was also a guest on the \u201cbrain drain\u201d radio show.\n\nHer company works to bring African talent back to the continent.\n\nJones told us they \u201cget calls from all over the world\u201d from people wanting to know the number of people emigrating to and from South Africa. \u201cWe say we can\u2019t do it. We don\u2019t know, Stats SA doesn\u2019t know,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to fill out a form to say you\u2019re emigrating, you can just go. So there\u2019s no actual way of measuring.\u201d\n\nHomecoming Revolution does conduct qualitative studies, Jones said. It will for example contact estate agents and independent schools and ask if they have seen an increase in people selling their homes or taking their children out of school because they\u2019re leaving the country.\n\nBut Jones cautioned against confusing enquiries in the property market, which the media often reports as high, with actual statistics or leaving. \u201cEnquiries tell us nothing\u2026 people panic and they enquire and then they don\u2019t actually move.\u201d\n\nIn a discussion on South Africa\u2019s economic struggles, a guest on the Money Show on 702 radio said that for every professional coming into South Africa, eight were leaving. The statistic was attributed to a 2017 government white paper on migration.\n\nWe traced the original stat to a 2006 paper on South Africa\u2019s immigration policy. But the paper\u2019s authors told Africa Check that the data would not apply now. And emigration data is no longer recorded at ports of exit.\n\nA number of experts said reliable and up to date emigration data is therefore difficult to collect or estimate. Given this we rate this claim as unproven - evidence publicly available at this time neither proves nor disproves the statement.\n\nUntil stronger official data on the movement of professionals into and out of South Africa is collected, we will remain with what the show\u2019s host Bruce Whitfield described as \u201canecdotal\u201d evidence of a spike.", "lang": "en"}
