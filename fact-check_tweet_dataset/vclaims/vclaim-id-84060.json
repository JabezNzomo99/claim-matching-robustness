The now Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath explained the need for his organisation which is called Hindu Yuva Vahini. In his speech, Adityanath claims that Hindu culture and Muslim culture can never co-exist and that a religious war is inevitable which is why Hindus need to get organised and face this challenge in the most aggressive fashion possible. He stated that Hindu Yuva Vahini is doing the work of uniting Hindus.\n\nYogi Adityanath\u2019s co-speaker in the same rally asks for Muslim women to be taken out from graves and be raped. And yet another speaker states that after the formation of Hindu Rashtra, the voting rights of Muslims will be taken away and they will be reduced to 2nd class citizens.", "lang": "en"}
