Just hours before Prime Minister Modi meets Chinese President Xi Jinping in Mahabalipuram, it has now been revealed there is an insidious plot by Pakistan behind this trend on Twitter,\u201d claimed the Times Now anchor while \u201cPak hand behind #GoBackModi trend\u201d and \u201cSpooked by India-China Bonhomie\u201d were flashed on television screens. The anchor asserted that most users tweeting this hashtag were from Pakistan.\n\nCNN News18 broadcast a similar reportage at around 4 PM \u2013 \u201cThis is a dangerous international conspiracy to defame India and its elected leader because we are learning that a lot of Pakistan-based Twitter handles are really behind this, presumably under the watch of its propaganda wing actively involved in pushing this trend is what Bhupendra Chaubey our executive editor is picking up\u2026\u201d\n\nChaubey went on to add, \u201cThis is a very very shocking activity which we are now seeing play out before us. The fact that the Indian Prime Minister who clearly is India\u2019s politician number one absolutely no debate about that\u2026what we have learnt from our sources that these handles have had a habit of retweeting and supporting a lot of stuff coming from Pakistan, from Imran Khan\u2026\u201d\n\nThe journalist also wrote similar words in a tweet, \u201c\u2026conspiracy being hatched against @narendramodi by Pakistani handles.\u201c\n\nThe Times of Indiaand India Todayalso suggested that \u201cPakistan-based elements\u201d were behind the trend. But the latter took it a step further in a 10 PM show on the same topic.\n\nIndia Today attempted to analyse the tweets made using the hashtag #GoBackModi in a later broadcast anchored by Rahul Kanwal. \u201c70% if the tweets originated from India. If you check the state-wise location map, 60% came from Tamil Nadu only,\u201d said a channel correspondent, Nikhil Rampal, to which Kanwal replied, \u201cBut I can fake that also if I am running a sophisticated operation. Make it seem like it\u2019s coming from Tamil Nadu but this could be the ISI as well.\u201d\n\nFurthering Kanwal\u2019s theory, Rampal explained how the \u2018operation\u2019 might have taken place \u2013 \u201cI want to show you an example. I just tweeted from Karachi and the Twitter location is showing me in Karachi right now. When Twitter gets my data, I just use a third party fake geotag\u2026Twitter locations can be faked very easily, Twitter trends can be manipulated from these locations because these are obtained services. So I fake a GPS, I put my location in Karachi and I write my tweet from New York, Chile, Antigua wherever I want to. That\u2019s how trends can be manipulated.\u201d\n\nMost media reports claimed that Pakistani users were behind trending #GoBackModi in India. However, Twitter trends are region-specific which means that for a topic to trend in India, users from India need to tweet on the issue, and similarly, if users are tweeting from Pakistan, the hashtag would trend in Pakistan. Furthermore, issues show up in the global trend list when people tweet about the topic from multiple countries at the same time.\n\n\u201cTrends are determined by an algorithm and, by default, are tailored for you based on who you follow, your interests, and your location,\u201d per Twitter trend FAQs which further states, \u201cLocation trends identify popular topics among people in a specific geographic location.\u201d\n\nHowever, India Today attempted to sow seeds of doubts when the channel claimed that location can easily be altered to manipulate Twitter. While false locations can be provided to Twitter, changing your location by providing fake coordinates does not mean that your tweet with a certain hashtag is adding to a trend in another country. This is because the mechanism that Twitter employs to determine a user\u2019s location is far more elaborate.\n\nHow do location settings on Twitter work?\n\n\u201cYour profile location is part of your public account profile and is completely optional. Your profile location is your place to express yourself and show the world who you s hare,\u201d according to Twitter. Profile location essentially lets a person sitting in the US put \u2018Australia\u2019 or \u2018Indonesia\u2019 or whichever country he/she wants to appear to be from. Further, Twitter also allows one to specify a geolocation (latitude, longitude) while tweeting, and there are ways of providing a fake geolocation.\n\nHowever, does this mean that a tweet posted from one country will add to a trend in another country if the location is altered?\n\nNo, and Twitter explains why \u2013 \u201cWhen you access Twitter, we may receive information about your location, such as your IP address, precise location information from GPS, or information about wireless networks or cell towers near your mobile device.\u201d\n\nThe sub-section \u2018location information\u2019 in Twitter privacy policy further elaborates on how the platform determines a person\u2019s location \u2013 \u201cWhen you use Twitter, even if you\u2019re just looking at Tweets, we receive some personal information from you like the type of device you\u2019re using and your IP address.\u201d\n\nIn layman\u2019s terms, a change in profile location does not hide your actual location because Twitter picks up users\u2019 IP address (and other data) which reveals their location. For instance, the IP address of the server used by Alt News discloses that the organisation is based out of Ahmedabad, Gujarat.\n\nFurthermore, let us also look at what was trending in both India and Pakistan on October 11, especially between 3 PM- 6 PM since this was when most media reports were published. Had a majority of users been from Pakistan, the hashtag would have trended in the country during this time. However, this was not the case.\n\n#GoBackModi or any other hashtag related to the Prime Minister\u2019s meeting with his Chinese counterpart did not trend in Pakistan between 3 PM to 6 PM . The only hashtag related to India trending in Pakistan was #KashmirChained. This was revealed by searching for worldwide Twitter trends on the website trends24.in.\n\nWe observed that the hashtag was picked up in Pakistan only after 9 PM when it was at the 20th spot.\n\nAt around 11:30 PM, it gained momentum and was trending at the 12th position.\n\nIndian social media users were tweeting in large numbers with the hashtag #GoBackModi between 3 PM to 6 PM on October 11.\n\nMore importantly, the hashtag maintained the top position during the hours leading up to the media broadcasts blaming Pakistani for trending #GoBackModi.\n\nMost tweets were in Tamil\n\nAlt News also performed a language-based search via Twitter search operators to determine the number of #GoBackModi tweets made in Urdu \u2013 the most prominent language used in Pakistan. We used the syntax \u2018#GoBackModi lang:ur since:2019-10-10\u2019 to search for all tweets made in Urdu since October 10. Till 12:30 PM on October 12, there were some 100 tweets and most of them were related to Kashmir.\n\nContrastingly, a similar search for all tweets made in Tamil since October 10 \u2013 \u2018#GoBackModi lang:ta since:2019-10-10\u2019 \u2013 throws up uncountable results. It is noteworthy that Tamil is an unpopular language in Pakistan.\n\nIndia Today itself claimed that 70% #GoBackModi tweets were from India and 60% of these originated from Tamil Nadu. But the channel did not provide any evidence on how this was an \u2018ISI conspiracy\u2019. Other media outlets \u2013 Times Now, News18,The Times of India \u2013 also alleged a mass conspiracy without backing its claim. Each of these organisations needs to come up with a logical explanation of the assumption that thousands of users in Pakistan managed to fake their IP addresses, GPS locations and all other parameters that Twitter uses to determine the location of an individual and gamed Twitter to get a hashtag to show up in the Indian trending list.\n\n[Update: Details about how geolocation can be faked were added to this story.]", "lang": "en"}
