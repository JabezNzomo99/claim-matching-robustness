It also committed to funding the NHS to the tune of an additional \u00a33 billion over the 2015 to 2020 parliament and to get rid of the Private Finance Initiative which it described as a way to \u201cprivatise the NHS by the back door\u201d.\n\nHowever, in a public meeting in 2012, Nigel Farage said \u201cI think we are going to have to think about healthcare very, very differently. I think we are going to have to move to an insurance-based system of healthcare. Frankly, I would feel more comfortable that my money would return value if I was able to do that through the marketplace of an insurance company, than just us trustingly giving \u00a3100 billion a year to central government and expecting them to organise the healthcare service from cradle to grave for us\".\n\nMr Farage has since said that \u201cUkip is 100 percent committed to keeping the NHS free at the point of use for all British nationals, and the service should be funded out of general taxation\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
