State appeals court Judge JoAnne Kloppenburg, who was a candidate for the high court in 2011, and Madison attorney Claude Covelli are also running.\n\nIn a Dec. 2, 2015 interview on \"The Devil\u2019s Advocates,\" a liberal radio talk show in Madison, Donald was asked about racial justice being part of his platform.\n\nDonald, who would be the first African-American elected to the state\u2019s high court (former Justice Louis Butler was appointed, then lost an election), said he supports alternatives to jail and prison.\n\n\"It isn't all about simply retribution and punishment,\" he said. \"That if you treat the underlying issues, then in essence you transform that person's life, you rehabilitate them, they are able to be productive citizens and they're able to be strong advocates for their families.\n\n \n\n \"And by strengthening families, in my opinion, you actually reduce crime. And so I'm a huge proponent of trying to address that issue. You know, we lock up close to 2.4 million in this country. We're locking up more people than China and Russia.\"\n\nWe'll see from a recent fact check that Donald's statement is essentially on target, though available figures for China are to some extent understated.\n\nIn October 2015, PolitiFact National rated Mostly True a statement by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is seeking the 2016 Democratic nomination for president. He said: \"Today in America, we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth.\"\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics\u2019 latest figures showed there were more than 2.22 million people in local jails, and state and federal prisons in 2013.\n\nWe found that other estimates -- which can vary based on the time they were made and the definition of incarceration -- are similar.\n\nThe University of London-based Institute for Criminal Policy Research also uses 2.22 million. And an estimate from the Massachusetts-based Prison Policy Initiative, a think tank that advocates for reducing the American prison population, was slightly higher, at 2.4 million.\n\nThose figures put the United States at No. 1 in the world in terms of incarcerating people.\n\nIt\u2019s a little harder to get rock-solid numbers internationally.\n\nChina is second, with 1.66 million prisoners, and Russia is third, with 642,470, according to the Institute for Criminal Policy Research.\n\nBut China\u2019s incarcerated population could very well be higher, the center notes. Chinese government officials reported in 2009 that more than 650,000 people were being held in detention centers around China on top of the count for sentenced prisoners. If that number was the same in mid-2013, the total prison population would be more than 2.3 million in China.\n\nIn terms of rate -- the number of people incarcerated compared to the entire population -- the United States is also well above Russia and China.\n\nThe U.S. incarceration rate is 698 per 100,000 people, far outpacing Russia (445) and China (119), according to the Institute for Criminal Policy Research.\n\nThat is second in the world behind tiny Seychelles (799), an Indian Ocean nation of 115 islands.\n\nDonald said: \"We lock up close to 2.4 million people in this country. We're locking up more people than China and Russia.\"\n\nThe best estimates are that the United States incarcerates 2.2 million to 2.4 people, far ahead of available figures for both China and Russia. But it\u2019s possible the China numbers are under counted.\n\nMilwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn: In Milwaukee County, juveniles arrested for car theft \"get sent immediately home, because under the point system in juvenile court\" on holding suspects, \"a stolen car gets zero points.\" Mostly False.\n\nU.S. Rep.
