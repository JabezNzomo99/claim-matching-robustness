She also attached a recording of the phone call in her Facebook post in which the person can be heard mouthing expletives.\n\nWhen we spoke to Sushmita regarding this issue, she sent across two audio recordings and a bunch of screenshots to show how she was being harassed and threatened by this person who was repeatedly calling her from different numbers and abusing her. First she received SMSes from 9504441148 which according to her is the personal number of Anish Jha. When she blocked that number, he repeatedly called her from two other numbers 8507590483 and 7004116537.\n\nShe told us that she has known Anish Jha for over 3 years while she was in Patna and before she came to Delhi. He apparently used to work for Sony India while she knew him and now works in a shop. She stated that she appreciates certain initiatives of AAP and also likes to express her views on Facebook which are usually critical of BJP. She stated that Anish had an issue with her political views and would message her regarding the same. At some point of time, she had blocked him on Facebook. However, post UP elections, he first started messaging her via SMS and then called her repeatedly from the aforementioned numbers. In the calls, besides using the most abusive language, she stated that caller also threatened to kill her friends Shahbaz Mallick and Ayan Younus.\n\nIn the above calls, between many vile abuses, the caller threatens to come to Delhi on either 1st May or 6th May and threatens to kill a friend of hers namely Ayan Yunus. Here\u2019s a screenshot of the SMSes she received from the 9504441148 number before she blocked the said number. The first SMS received is at 10:23 on 11th March which coincides with the results of UP Elections. By that time, BJP had moved ahead in the race and looked set to capture Uttar Pradesh.\n\nHere are two more screenshots which show the multiple times she was called from the numbers 8507590483 and 7004116537.\n\nShe told us that she will file a police complaint if the situation demanded it.", "lang": "en"}
