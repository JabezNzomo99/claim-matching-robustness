Globally, there are about 4.8 million cases of coronavirus\u2014about 1.5 million of which are in the United States. More than 316,000 people have died worldwide from the virus and its complications, including about 90,000 in the U.S.\n\nDr. Paul Offit, the director of the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia\u2019s Vaccine Education Center, told The Dispatch Fact Check that, while the heat and humidity of summer might cause coronavirus to wane, the United States is far from out of the woods. \u201cThere is every reason to believe that it will be back in the winter,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout a vaccine, a large percentage of the U.S. population is still susceptible to this virus. And there remains no evidence that we have stopped the circulation of this virus. While a vaccine could provide large-scale population immunity, it is unlikely that we will have a vaccine before next year.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s own advisers agree\u2014Centers for Disease Control Director Dr. Robert Redfield has said that the country needs to be prepared for a second wave of the virus in the winter, an outcome National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci called \u201cinevitable.\u201d\n\nThe director of communications for President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign Tim Murtaugh took to Twitter Sunday to complain that Eric Trump\u2019s remarks were being taken out of context:\n\nMurtaugh\u2019s tweet came in response to the below statement from Kate Bedingfield, communications director of Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign:\n\nWe\u2019re in the middle of the biggest public health emergency in a century, with almost 90,000 Americans dead, 1.5 million infected, and 36 million workers newly jobless, so for Eric Trump to claim that the coronavirus is a political hoax that will \u2018magically\u2019 disappear is absolutely stunning and unbelievably reckless. The simple fact is that President Trump ignored the threat of the coronavirus for months and has mishandled the response at every step since \u2014 destroying the strong economy he inherited from the Obama-Biden administrations and leading to countless unnecessary deaths. Trump\u2019s campaign knows he can\u2019t run on that dismal record so they\u2019re desperate to do whatever they can to throw up a smokescreen to try to conceal his historic mismanagement of this crisis.\n\nFor context, Eric Trump was replying to a question about how the pandemic was going to affect elections in the fall. Here is his response in its entirety:\n\nListen, Biden loves this. Biden can\u2019t go on stage without making some horrible blunder, I mean even from his basement he\u2019s making awful gaffes every single day, so his campaign is thrilled that he's not going out there. They think they\u2019re taking away Donald Trump\u2019s greatest tool, which is being able to go into an arena and fill it with 50,000 people every single time, right. So they will and you watch, they\u2019ll milk it every single day between now and November 3. And guess what, after November 3, coronavirus will magically all of a sudden go away and disappear and everybody will be able to reopen. They\u2019re trying to deprive him of his greatest asset, which is the fact that the American people love him, the fact that he\u2019s relatable, the fact that he can go out there and draw massive crowds. Joe Biden can\u2019t get ten people in a room, my father is getting 50,000 in a room, and they want to do everything they can to stop it. So make no mistake, to a lot of them, Jeanine, to a lot of them, this is a very cognizant strategy that they\u2019re trying to employ. It\u2019s no different than, again the nonsense they\u2019re trying to throw in the Hope Act, it\u2019s no different than the mail-in voting that they want to do in all these places, it is no different than wanting illegal immigrants to vote in our country. It is a cognizant strategy. And it\u2019s sad, and again it\u2019s not going to be allowed to happen\u2014we\u2019re going to win November.\n\nWhile Eric Trump did refer to \u201cthe extending of social distancing and the resistance to reopening the economy in certain states\u201d as Murtaugh states, with the context of his entire answer it\u2019s clear that Trump is suggesting the social distancing and economic lockdown will end because the virus will \u201call of a sudden go away and disappear.\u201d Though he doesn\u2019t use the word \u201choax,\u201d the clear implication is that the severity of the virus is being overblown to justify continued social distancing policies to harm the Trump campaign.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com.
