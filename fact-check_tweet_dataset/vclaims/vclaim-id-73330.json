The claim is false; there is no evidence of any such directive and a WHO representative in Tanzania confirmed that the office is still operational.\n\n\u201cTanzania Kicks Out WHO After Goat & Papaya Samples Came COVID-19 Positive,\u201d reads the headline on an article published by an Indian-based website called Great Game India, which describes itself as a \u201cjournal of geopolitics and international relations\u201d.\n\nThe article has attracted more than 15,000 interactions on Facebook, according to the social media monitoring tool CrowdTangle.\n\nMultiple Facebook posts (here, here, here and here) shared the article.\n\n\u201cWith the rise in false Coronavirus cases, the Tanzanian President John Magufuli, growing suspicious of the World Health Organization (WHO), decided to investigate the claims himself,\u201d reads the article. \u201cHe sent the WHO samples of a goat, a papaya and a quail for testing. After all 3 samples came COVID-19 positive, the President is reported to have kicked out the WHO from the country.\u201d\n\nIn May, Magufuli questioned his own country\u2019s coronavirus numbers after he said that he had secretly sent samples from a variety of animals, fruits and vehicle oil to be tested for COVID-19 at the national laboratory and that they came back positive.\n\nMagufuli claimed that there was \u201csabotage\u201d and called on authorities to conduct investigations. He then suspended the head of the laboratory.\n\nHowever, the article\u2019s claim is false: the UN health agency\u2019s office in Tanzania is still operational.\n\n\u201cThe World Health Organization has not been kicked out of Tanzania. Our office is still in operation,\u201d WHO communications officer Collins Boakye-Agyemang told AFP Fact Check in an email.\n\nTanzania\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Professor Palamagamba Kabudi, also dismissed the claims as \u201ccompletely fake\u201d.\n\n\u201cFirstly, there is no relationship between the WHO and the results of the samples provided in the national laboratory. WHO representatives are not involved in testing at all,\u201d Kabudi told AFP Fact Check in a phone call.\n\n\u201cThe relationship between Tanzania and WHO is very good and the representative is around as usual. That information is completely fake,\u201d Kabudi added.\n\nLast year, the WHO issued a lengthy statement detailing how Tanzania had failed to provide information on suspected cases of Ebola in the country.\n\nIn what was a rare rebuke, the UN health agency said it had not confirmed any case of Ebola in Tanzania, but raised concerns about the death of a person with suspected Ebola and contacts who had thereafter fallen ill.\n\nTanzania dismissed the concerns about possible Ebola cases in the country as \u201crumours which everyone should ignore\u201d and summoned WHO representatives for an explanation.\n\nThis year, during the current coronavirus pandemic, Tanzania has not strictly enforced precautionary measures recommended by the WHO and other health bodies, such as wearing face masks and avoiding social gatherings. A claim that Tanzania had banned the use of face masks was debunked here by AFP Fact Check.\n\nThe east African country has also not released any coronavirus infection data since April 29, 2020. By the last count, according to the World Health Organization, there had been 509 positive cases and 21 deaths.\n\nThe WHO is currently providing Tanzania with technical support to fight the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cWHO and a number of key partners continue to provide technical support to the Tanzanian government\u2019s response to COVID-19 through its membership in various technical committees,\u201d Boakye-Agyemang said.", "lang": "en"}
