After the deal was reached, the United Nations Security Council \u2014 which had imposed sanctions on Iran to pressure it to negotiate \u2014 adopted Resolution 2231. The resolution endorsed the deal and outlined conditions under which sanctions are to be lifted. Under the resolution, ballistic missile restrictions expire after eight years.\n\nThe deal does not prohibit the testing or development of ballistic missiles. But the U.N. resolution does contain restrictions relating to ballistic missiles. So how is Iran able to continue its testing? Experts say the resolution\u2019s language allows Iran to argue that its ballistic missiles do not fit within the restrictions laid out in Resolution 2231.\n\nPrevious U.N. resolutions had stated that the council \u201cdecides that Iran shall not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.\u201d The new resolution states \u201cIran is called upon not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology.\u201d\n\nThe language change from \u201cdecides that Iran shall not\u201d to \u201cIran is called upon\u201d represents a softening in tone, signaling a more non-legally-binding appeal. This change was made precisely because the Iran deal does not contain any limits on the country\u2019s missile programs, said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey.\n\n\u201cIt is perfectly respectable for opponents of the agreement to object to the Iran deal on these grounds \u2014 the JCPOA removes missile-related sanctions without requiring Iran to limit its missile programs,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThis was the hardest part of the agreement for me to accept, even if that sanctions relief only occurs after eight years.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf one finds that the missiles used are designed for nuclear weapon delivery, it appears to me that there will evidently be also a problem with the compliance with the JCPOA, which bans weaponization activities,\u201d said Olli Heinonen, who led the IAEA\u2019s safeguards section during the 2003-2005 talks between Iran and three European powers (Britain, France and Germany).\n\nBut the ad itself does not say that Iran\u2019s actions violate the \u201cspirit\u201d of the deal or that it violates the U.N. resolution. It says Iran is violating the agreement that Isakson opposed. That agreement would be the Iran deal, not the U.N. resolution.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s frustration [over the testing], and we have to look for effective policy tools to impede Iran\u2019s missile program. But none of those tools, unfortunately, is the ability to say this is a violation of the Iran nuclear deal,\u201d said Robert Einhorn, senior fellow at Brookings Institution and former special adviser on arms control and nonproliferation at the State Department.\n\nIsakson\u2019s ad is about the Iran deal and his opposition to it. It claims that Iran is \u201calready violating\u201d the nuclear agreement by illegally testing ballistic missiles. Yet the actual deal did not have restrictions on ballistic missiles testing. Instead, the U.N. resolution that implements the deal contains the language. A range of experts we consulted said that the testing could be argued as violating the Iran deal but that it will be difficult. It\u2019s an important technical distinction that is not reflected in the ad, ultimately misleading viewers. Moreover, it\u2019s a matter of interpretation as to whether the testing is \u201cillegal\u201d under the resolution.\n\nWe understand that it\u2019s probably not as catchy for a narrator in a campaign ad to say, \u201cWestern leaders view Iran\u2019s missile tests as a violation of the U.N. resolution passed in tandem\u201d or that the testing is \u201cinconsistent with the spirit of the Iran deal.\u201d But both of those phrases are accurate, and are certainly preferable to the sweeping, inaccurate claim in the ad.", "lang": "en"}
