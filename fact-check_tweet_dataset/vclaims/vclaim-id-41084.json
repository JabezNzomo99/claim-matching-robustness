The claim is false; American broadcaster ABC News said the photo shows its staff working at the protest; AFP separately identified one of the men seen in the photo as an ABC News journalist.\n\nThe photo was published here on Facebook in a public group called \u201cAlliance In Support of Our Police Force Official FB Fans Page\u201d.\n\nThe post has been shared more than 600 times.\n\nIt was published on October 3, 2019, two days after Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters staged a large demonstration against China\u2019s National Day. Here is an AFP news report about the events.\n\nIn the photo, several people can be standing next to a black people carrier with license plate CX7. A second black vehicle with registration plate CX78 can also be seen in front of the car.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading Facebook post:\n\nThe post\u2019s caption, written in both English and traditional Chinese characters, translates to English as: \u201cFrom Silk Road 21. Hong Kong riots: Action command centre\n\n\u201cDuring Hong Kong\u2019s riots on the National Day, an \u2018ex-soldier\u2019 took this photo. The attached caption:\n\n\u201c\u2018This is the command car that commanded the protesters downstairs from my apartment yesterday. As the clearance proceeded, the Caucasians returned to the car to change their clothes and refresh.\n\n\u201cPay attention to the six abdominal muscles, age and the overall body condition. Also note that the number of the car they use, CX7, is very similar to that of the car CX78 in front of them. There are one or two other cars the one in the front as support vehicles.\n\n\u201cTo me this looks like an operational support team -- external 'advisers'.\u201d\n\nAnother Facebook post published earlier on the same date in Facebook group 21SilkRd can be seen here with a similar caption in English. It has been shared more than 150 times.\n\nThe photo was also published here, here and here on Facebook; here and here on Weibo; and here and here on Twitter with a similar claim. It was published in other Facebook posts here and here with a claim that the cars might be owned by Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific.\n\nThe claims are false. American broadcaster ABC News published this news article on October 3, 2019, clarifying that the photo in fact shows its news crew working at the protest in Hong Kong.\n\nThe report states in part: \u201cA photograph circulating on social media misidentifies Senior Foreign Correspondent Ian Pannell and an ABC News crew as \u2018external advisers\u2019 and \u2018an operational support team\u2019 for protesters in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cThe picture was taken on Tuesday apparently from an apartment building at the intersection of Star Street and Monmouth Path in the Wan Chai district of Hong Kong, next to the Three Pacific Place office building. The photo also misidentifies a vehicle used by the ABC News team as a \u2018command car directing the protesters.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe ABC News team was in Hong Kong on Tuesday covering the unauthorized protest march in the Admiralty District, including the clearance operation outside the Hong Kong Government headquarters. The ABC News team had previously positioned its vehicles on Monmouth Path.\u201d\n\nThe report also contained a screenshot comparison of the photo in the misleading post with photos of Pannell in Hong Kong.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the photo:\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the misleading image (L) and Pannell\u2019s photo in the ABC News article (R):\n\nA video included in the ABC News article shows Pannell broadcasting live in Hong Kong from the one-minute 56-second mark. The video is embedded below:\n\nPannell separately tweeted this video and this photo of events in Hong Kong from his official Twitter account on October 1, 2019.\n\nThe photo in the misleading posts corresponds with Google Street View imagery here from Monmouth Path in Wan Chai district.
