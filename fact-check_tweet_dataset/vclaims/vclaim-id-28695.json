Extrapolating statewide, he says the data suggests as many as 45,000 voters sat out the election, though he cautioned that it was difficult to produce an estimate from just two counties. \u201cWe have hard evidence there were tens of thousands of people who were unable to vote because of the voter ID law,\u201d Mayer told me.\n\n\u201cWe were careful not to extrapolate statewide, as we do not have information about what the effects were outside of the regions we sampled,\u201d Mayer wrote in an email. \u201cOur goal was to understand the effects more precisely, among populations most likely to be affected. We also were careful, in that someone who did not vote because of the ID law might not have voted even if the law were not in effect.\u201d\n\n\"The claim is ludicrous because Wisconsin was not a state covered by the part of the Voting Rights Act, which the Supreme Court killed in the Shelby County case. So even if it had been in effect it wouldn\u2019t have stopped implementation of Wisconsin voter ID, as it had stopped Texas\u2019s voter ID. \"The numbers of people who were turned away from the polls is likely much lower than Clinton says. The most reputable study, which I think still overstates things, is the one by Ken Mayer at U. Wisconsin. But there is reason to be very cautious about trying to attribute the presence or absence of voter ID to turnout. A recent NBER study found no effect whatsoever. \u201cAnd it really is besides the point. The question is why Wisconsin is putting into effect a law which prevents no appreciable amount of fraud and puts stumbling blocks in front of voters.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
