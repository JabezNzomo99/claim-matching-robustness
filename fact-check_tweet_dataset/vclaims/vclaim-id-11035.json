The misleading tweet remained live for nearly 24 hours before being deleted:\n\nNot only did \u201cStone Cold\u201d misspell Mallinger\u2019s surname, he also attached the image of a different person. The woman in the image is Hungarian-born photographer Ata Kand\u00f3, who passed away in 2017 just before her 104th birthday. It\u2019s a copyrighted portrait taken by Dutch photographer Koos Breukel, who weighed in to warn that he was considering legal action for the misuse of his work:\n\nMallinger was one of 11 people massacred inside the Tree of Life synagogue during Sabbath services on 27 October 2018. An authentic image of Mallinger was published by several news organizations, including the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Among the misinformation spread online about the shooting and its victims was the false claim that Mallinger survived the Holocaust.\n\nRyan Graney, who volunteers to speak on behalf of the family of Sandy Hook school shooting victim Vicki Soto, said she reported the misinformation multiple times to Twitter but received no response from the platform. \u201cThis is how conspiracy theories start,\u201d she told us. We reached out to both Twitter and \u201cStone Cold\u201d with questions addressing the post, but likewise received no response. An archived version of the tweet can be viewed here.\n\nRobert Bowers, 46, has been charged in the synagogue shooting. He posted a torrent of racist and anti-Semitic comments online in the lead-up to the attack.", "lang": "en"}
