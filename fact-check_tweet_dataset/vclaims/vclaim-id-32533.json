The latest reuploaded article bore the headline:\n\nThe articles of Pinoy Trends, Social Net PH, and Happy Pinoy, are carbon copies of each other except for the word \u201cfinally\u201d added at the beginning of the first two sites' headlines. All are falsely claiming COA discovered, at last, that the Aquino administration pocketed the Quick Response Fund (QRF) of the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) and donations for the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) supposedly allotted for victims of Super Typhoon Yolanda in 2013.\n\nThe COA report which the article appears to be referring to is a six-year-old . There are also details included in the outdated articles which are not found in the official COA report.\n\u2022 The amount allotted for the QRF identified in the said document is P692.77 million, not P629.77 million.\n\u2022 It was declared in the COA report that the P48.82 million donation to the NDRRMC \u201cremained not utilized\u201d as of 2013 and that the reason behind the failure to allocate the QRF is \u201cinadequate planning.\u201d This belies the recycled articles\u2019 claim that the money was \u201cpocketed\u201d by the PNoy administration.\n\nThe OCD, in the on the office, has already \u201cpartially implemented\u201d the recommendations given to them by COA the previous year regarding the unallocated funds and donations for the victims of the super typhoon. The post which Happy Pinoy ultimately cited as its source is Asian Policy\u2019s (asianpolicy.press) . (See VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Online posts MISLEAD with old story on Noynoy Aquino's undistributed Yolanda funds )\n\nPinoy Trends\u2019 article made the rounds on the Web a few weeks before the sixth anniversary of the powerful typhoon which caused widespread devastation and killed at least 6,300 people. The post received 4,900 interactions and could have reached a total of 1.1 million social media users.\n\nIts top traffic generators are Facebook groups BongBong Marcos United, DUTERTE PARA SA BAYAN!, and SARA DUTERTE FOR PRESIDENT 2022 - JOIN NA PO KAYO.", "lang": "en"}
