Elijah Cummings? No, that's not true: the story was put out by a parody Twitter account after a real report about a failed burglary at Cummings' house surfaced.\n\nThe story originated from a tweet published by parody account @CronkiteSays on August 2, 2019, supposedly written by \"Walter Cronkite\" (archived here). The tweet read:\n\nHowever the bio of the Twitter account that originally put out the story reads:\n\nThe real Walter Cronkite did indeed pass away in 2009.\n\nThe account @CronkiteSays usually posts short, satirical quips about current events. The Cummings burglary tweet was likely based on real reports of a possibly attempted burglary in which nothing was stolen:\n\nRep. Cummings Says Someone Tried To Break Into His Home. 'Too Bad!' Trump Says Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland says an intruder tried to gain entry into his home in Baltimore early Saturday. Cummings said the incident happened at about 3:40 a.m. ET. \"I was notified of the intrusion by my security system, and I scared the intruder away by yelling before the person gained entry into the residential portion of the house,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe image used in the parody tweet was definitely not the house of Elijah Cummings, it shows the Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles in France:\n\nThe Hall of Mirrors ( French: Grande Galerie or Galerie des Glaces) is the central gallery of the Palace of Versailles in Versailles, France. Within the hall, the German Empire was declared in 1871 (Deutsche Reichsgr\u00fcndung) and the Treaty of Versailles signed by the victorious powers of World War I in 1919.\n\nDespite the fact that the tweet was sent as a joke many people appear to have fallen for it, including Chuck Woolery, who tweeted this to his 598K followers in reply to the hoax tweet:", "lang": "en"}
