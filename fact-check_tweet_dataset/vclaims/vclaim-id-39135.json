And that\u2019s what it is FRAUD!!!\u201d\n\nThe post has been viewed more than 316,000 times and received more than 6000 shares and more than 50 comments.\n\nThe Australian Red Cross was formed in 1914 at the outbreak of World War I. The charity works to ensure the safety of people affected by disasters, wars and other humanitarian issues.\n\nDuring the 2019-2020 Australian bushfire crisis, donations flooded into Australian Red Cross coffers as the fires tore through communities, but as the donations rose so did criticism of how the funds were being distributed.\n\nRegarding the donations figure, the Australian Red Cross website showed on February 15, a day before the Facebook post, that $140 million has been raised. The charity\u2019s last update on February 20 put the figure at $150 million.\n\nThe post claims that the charity \u201chave only given out 7 million in $10,000 lots to some of the desperate people who have lost everything\u201d. When the Facebook post was uploaded on February 16, the Australian Red Cross had paid $32 million in emergency grants, according to a media release dated February 13. In an email on March 3, the Australian Red Cross told AAP FactCheck that \u201cmore than $48 million has been given out in direct financial assistance\u201d.\n\nOn February 3 the Australian Red Cross announced they were doubling the funding for their immediate assistance program. In a statement the charity said extra financial assistance included: \u201cAn additional $10,000 payment to support people whose homes were destroyed and require further assistance, extending the total amount available to $20,000\u201d.\n\nAAP FactCheck traced the source of the \u201c7 million in $10,000 lots\u201d quoted in the post to a TV interview with Australian Red Cross director Noel Clement (1 min 2 sec) on January 22. Clement told the Nine Network\u2019s Today program that \u201cwe\u2019ve allocated 30 million dollars of immediate relief for people who have lost their homes\u2026 They are $10,000 grants, we\u2019ve paid 700 of those so far\u201d.\n\nThe Australian Red Cross lists a breakdown of emergency payments on its website and provided additional details to AAP FactCheck via email. The charity\u2019s website states a $20,000 emergency grant is available for people \u201cwhose primary place of residence was destroyed\u201d or \u201cwho have lost a next of kin\u201d. The Red Cross also provides a $7500 injury grant for people \u201cwho have spent more than two days in hospital \u201cas a direct result of bushfires\u201d and a primary residence repair grant of $5000 for \u201chomeowners whose homes have been structurally damaged\u201d. There are currently no $10,000 grants available.\n\nThe post also claims the charity \u201care keeping millions to be used for other use???\u201d The Australian Red Cross website states $5 million will be used \u201cfor 24/7 support including evacuations, relief centres and outreach services\u201d and \u201cup to 10c in each dollar will be spent on admin support costs\u201d.\n\nBased on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the Facebook post to be false. At the time of the February 16 post, $140 million had been donated to the Australian Red Cross for bushfire victims not $150 million as claimed. Regarding the claim the charity had only distributed $7 million \u201cin $10,000 lots\u201d, this was not correct at the time of the post. The Australian Red Cross had paid $32 million in emergency grants, according to a media release dated February 13. The charity also announced on February 3 that it was providing an additional $10,000 to extend the amount available to $20,000 as part of its immediate assistance. False \u2013 The primary claim of the content is factually inaccurate. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://factcheck.aap.com.au/", "lang": "en"}
