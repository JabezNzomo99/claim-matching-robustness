Tulsi Gabbard tweeted, \u201cJust for the record, I am not suicidal, and I have no plans to kill myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cKinda sad that she even had to do that,\u201d reads the caption.\n\nThe tweet is doctored. There is no record of her tweeting this.\n\nFeatured in the Facebook post is a screen grab of an alleged tweet from Tulsi Gabbard saying, \u201cJust for the record, I am not suicidal, and I have no plans to kill myself.\u201d It also shows the headline of a Fox Business article about Gabbard\u2019s $50 million defamation lawsuit against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for Clinton calling her a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d\n\nDespite, the tweet looking authentic at first glance, it appears to have been doctored. The Daily Caller found no record the statement in the Hawaii congresswoman\u2019s verified Twitter accounts nor ProPublica\u2019s archive of her deleted tweets.\n\nAnother post claims Gabbard made a similar statement in the \u201cParties\u201d section of her lawsuit against Clinton.\n\n\u201cTulsi Gabbard is a natural person who is a citizen and domiciliary of the State of Hawaii,\u201d allegedly reads part of the lawsuit. \u201cShe has never experienced, does not currently experience, and does not expect to experience, thoughts of suicide.\u201d\n\nBut a quick search of the actual lawsuit shows it simply states Gabbard\u2019s citizenship and state of residence. (RELATED: Did Ocasio-Cortez Tweet About Electric Cars During Hurricane Dorian?)\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the tweets of politicians have been doctored. In recent months, the Caller has debunked fake tweets from President Donald Trump, former President Barack Obama and Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, among several others.\n\nGabbard\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.", "lang": "en"}
