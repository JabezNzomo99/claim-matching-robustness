(This is the same lawsuit that West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey signed on to, as we\u2019ve noted.)\n\nIn an April 1 tweet, the state party said that President Donald Trump \"is threatening to overturn the entire Affordable Care Act that provided over 200,000 West Virginians with healthcare coverage. Our seniors depend on it for affordable prescriptions and pre-existing condition coverage.\"\n\nHere, we\u2019ll look at whether the party is correct that \"over 200,000 West Virginians with healthcare coverage.\" (The West Virginia Democratic Party did not respond to an inquiry for this article.)\n\nThe Affordable Care Act provides two primary ways to get coverage -- individual policies purchased on online marketplaces and an expansion of Medicaid to a wider group of eligible Americans. We turned to data on both types from the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nFor 2019, the number of West Virginians purchasing health insurance on the marketplace totaled 22,599.\n\nAnd for fiscal year 2017, West Virginia added 183,100 residents to its Medicaid rolls due to the Affordable Care Act. (Kaiser communications director Craig Palosky said 2017 figures are the most recent available due to state-by-state reporting lags.)\n\nCombined, that works out to 205,699 West Virginia residents securing coverage from the law, making the Democratic tweet accurate.\n\nPalosky added that other West Virginians benefited from the law without specifically securing insurance under the law. For instance, the law required coverage of pre-existing conditions and provided more generous coverage of prescription drugs under Medicare.\n\nThe West Virginia Democratic Party said the Affordable Care Act \"provided over 200,000 West Virginians with health care coverage.\"\n\nThe combination of insurance purchases on the marketplace and the increase in Medicaid coverage works out to 205,699, according to the most recent data available. That\u2019s in line with what the tweet said, so we rate it True.", "lang": "en"}
