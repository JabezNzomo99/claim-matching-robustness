The claim is false; the clip has been edited from a longer video of a 2017 campaign speech; Gandhi\u2019s words have been taken out of context. In the original footage, he is commenting on what he describes as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's unrealistic pledges to farmers.\n\nThe video, posted here on Facebook where it has been viewed more than 50,000 times since it was published on April 11, 2019.\n\nThe 24-second clip appears to show Indian National Congress party president Rahul Gandhi at a public rally telling the crowd that he will give farmers fields on the moon to grow crops.\n\nThe Hindi audio translates to English as: \u201cYou can't make money from your farmlands here, look at the Moon. I will provide you with farmland on the moon. In the future, you will grow potatoes there. I'll put up a machine there and then we will export potato back to Gujarat.\"\n\nThe misleading post\u2019s caption says: \u201cSomebody pls stop him, He is promising he will give fields on moon to grow crop.\u201d\n\nBelow is the screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nSimilar posts have been shared repeatedly on Facebook, for example here, and on Twitter here.\n\nBut the clip in the misleading post is an edited version of a longer video showing a Congress party rally on November 12, 2017 in Patan town in the western state of Gujarat in India.\n\nThe original full video is 2 hours and 23 minutes long and shows a public rally called \u2018Yuva Rojgar Khedut Adhikar Navsarjan Yatra\u2019.\n\nThe full-length video, including Rahul Gandhi\u2019s comments, can be seen here on one of Congress\u2019 official Facebook pages, where it was streamed live on November 12, 2017.\n\nThe original video was also uploaded here on the Gujarat Congress official YouTube channel on November 17, 2017.\n\nGandhi starts speaking at 1 hour 58 minutes and 18 seconds and at 2 hours 18 minutes and 11 seconds Gandhi refers to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying that Modi has been making false promises to farmers.\n\nGandhi says: \u201cI don\u2019t make false promises, even if sometimes you don\u2019t like it. Mr. Modi says: \u2018You can't make money from your farmlands here, look at the moon. I will provide you with farmland on the moon. In the future, you will grow potatoes there. I'll put up a machine there and then we will export potatoes back to Gujarat.\u2019\"\n\nBelow is the side by side comparison between the misleading post (R) and the original video (L):\n\nRahul Gandhi\u2019s speech from the original video was also uploaded on Rahul Gandhi\u2019s official YouTube channel here on November 12, 2017.\n\nThe misleading clip in this video appears from 19 minutes 57 seconds.", "lang": "en"}
