It actually comes from an anonymous essay published in 1753 that was likely written by John Hawkesworth.\n\nSwift, an Anglo-Irish writer active during the late 17th and early 18th centuries, is perhaps best known for writing \u201cGulliver\u2019s Travels\u201d and \u201cA Modest Proposal.\u201d (RELATED: \u2018The Trick Is Not To Expect It But To Delight In It When It Comes\u2019 \u2013 Did Charles Dickens Say This Quote About Happiness?)\n\nWhile Swift did explore various elements of the human condition in his writings, there is no evidence that he authored the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. A search of his complete works didn\u2019t turn up any matching or similar phrases.\n\nThe Daily Caller reached out to several experts, all of whom confirmed the quote did not come from Swift.\n\n\u201cIn fact it sounds like something Swift would NOT say,\u201d Leo Damrosch, a literature professor at Harvard University, told the Caller in an email. \u201cHe was deeply suspicious of romantic love and always insisted that strong friendship was better.\u201d\n\nOther experts \u2013 Penn State Brandywine professor Paul deGategno and Hillsdale College professor Dutton Kearney \u2013 told the Caller that the statement comes from an anonymous article published in a March 1753 edition of a London-based journal. \u201cIt\u2019s from The Adventurer, Essay Number 36,\u201d said Kearney in an email to the Caller. \u201cSwift never wrote for this journal.\u201d\n\nHawkesworth, one of the publication\u2019s founders, may have actually authored the saying, according to deGategno.", "lang": "en"}
