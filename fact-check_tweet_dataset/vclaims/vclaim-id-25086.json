Adjustments to Social Security benefits are not decided by lawmakers.\n\nA 2.8 percent increase in Social Security benefits goes into effect this month.\n\nThe increase is the result of a cost-of-living adjustment that, according to the Social Security Administration, is based on economic calculations \u2014 not on the whim of lawmakers.\n\nEven so, claims have recirculated on social media this week \u2014 after cropping up in the fall \u2014 that \u201cALL the Democrats voted AGAINST the 2.8% Social Security cost of living increase.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not true. Lawmakers didn\u2019t vote on the increase.\n\nThe cost-of-living adjustment (or COLA) was announced in October. The annual adjustment is determined by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, which is calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. When there is no increase in the CPI-W for the specified time period, there is no COLA.\n\nThe purpose of the automatic adjustment, according to the SSA, is to ensure that the purchasing power of Social Security benefits isn\u2019t minimized by inflation.\n\nIt\u2019s been that way since 1975. Prior to that, benefit increases were the result of special legislation enacted by Congress.\n\nMisinformation about Social Security benefits has been going around for years.\n\nIn 2017, we wrote about websites and blogs erroneously crediting President Donald Trump for the COLA announced in 2016 \u2014 before he took office. Years earlier, in 2010, we debunked a congressional candidate\u2019s TV ad that blamed Congress for the fact that there was no cost-of-living adjustment that year. That followed our 2009 piece about a chain email that made an equally false claim about Democrats blocking an increase in benefits for 2009.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on the social media network.\n\nKiely, Eugene. \u201cCongress Did Not Raise Its Pay, Deny Seniors Increase.\u201d FactCheck.org. 6 May 2010.", "lang": "en"}
