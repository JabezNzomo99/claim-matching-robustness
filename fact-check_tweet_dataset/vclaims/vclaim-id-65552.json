One target in the drill was a mockup of a U.S. military ship \u2013 a replica of the Nimitz-class aircraft carriers the U.S. Navy routinely sails in the Persian Gulf waters.\n\nIranian news agencies reported that the drills \"simulated a real warzone engagement\u201d and were \u201cmeant to send across a message of warning to those potentially seeking to undermine the country\u2019s security.\u201d\n\nNour-1, Iran\u2019s first military satellite, which was launched in April, monitored the wargames and simultaneously transmitted \u201chigh resolution\u201d images of the U.S.-operated al-Udeid Airbase in Qatar, the Iranian news agencies reported.\n\nIranian state TV channels broadcast live video of the exercise, followed by footage of the destruction of the mockup vessel in their hourly news programs and special features.\n\nAccording to Mehr, General Hajizadeh said the drills demonstrated the IRGC\u2019s extensive capabilities, including the launch of missiles:\n\n\"During the Payambar-e Azam 14 (The Great Prophet) war games in south Iran, IRGC successfully launched underground ballistic missiles for the first time in the world.\"\n\nIt may be a first-time success for Iran, but the world has been launching missiles from the underground platforms called \u201csilos\u201d for decades.\n\nNazi Germany built the first underground missile-launching hubs around 1943. The Nazis constructed silos in occupied France and the Baltics, using the latter as a test site for long-range missiles (V-2, A-4) which, at the time, were top secret. By the beginning of 1944, U.S. intelligence had identified and bombed 96 Nazi silos, preventing them from becoming operational.\n\nAfter World War II, the U.S. military adopted the technology for intercontinental nuclear missiles, building hundreds of silos across the country during the Cold War. The Soviet Union and other countries followed suit.\n\nAccording to the Arms Control Association, 31 countries have ballistic missiles, and few still launch them from the underground hubs. The U.S. considers launching silos \u201cvulnerable\u201d and the technology \u201coutdated.\u201d It now focuses on mobile launch technologies.\n\nMany of the U.S. missile silos have been decommissioned. Some have been purchased by private citizens and turned into houses or safe bunkers. Following the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001, the market for silos heated up.\n\nIntercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) are considered especially dangerous as weapons of mass destruction because of their ability to carry nuclear, biological or chemical warheads. They are relatively precise and fast, and some are capable of hypersonic speeds.\n\nDuring Iran\u2019s latest exercises, U.S. military bases in Saudi Arabia and Qatar were briefly put on high alert after detecting the missile launches in Iran, the Pentagon said.\n\nCmdr. Rebecca Rebarich, a spokesperson for the U.S. Navy\u2019s 5th Fleet, called Iran\u2019s behavior \u201cirresponsible and reckless.\u201d Still, she said the drills have \u201cnot disrupted coalition operations in the area nor had any impacts to the free flow of commerce in the Strait of Hormuz and surrounding waters.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Navy\u2019s 5th Fleet has been deployed to the Persian Gulf as part of the International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC), a multinational effort, currently led by the U.K., to safeguard maritime traffic in the region.\n\nIn November 2019, the U.S. launched Operation Sentinel \u201cto increase surveillance of and security in key waterways in the Middle East to ensure freedom of navigation in light of recent events in the Arabian Gulf region.\u201d\n\nBased in Bahrain, Operation Sentinel includes the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Australia and the United Kingdom.\n\nFor decades, Iran has opposed any Western naval presence in the Persian Gulf, but Tehran\u2019s actions have seldom crossed the threshold of verbal threats and occasional harassment of the U.S. vessels. Experts say \u201cextreme escalation\u201d in the Gulf would be a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d for Iran, cutting it off from its main supply routes.\n\nThe New York Times reported on July 18 that Iran and China had forged a wide-ranging economic and security partnership, under which Beijing will invest billions of dollars in Iran\u2019s energy and other sectors.\n\nThe agreement with China is a \u201cgame changer\u201d for Iran, Elisa Catalano Ewers and Ariana Tabatabai wrote in the War on the Rocks blog.\n\nThe deal \u201cwould allow Iran to close the Strait of Hormuz without losing its ability to export oil and forfeiting corresponding revenues. It would also allow Iran to sustain energy supplies to China, thus avoiding the political backlash that might come from taking more offensive actions in the Strait of Hormuz,\u201d they wrote.", "lang": "en"}
