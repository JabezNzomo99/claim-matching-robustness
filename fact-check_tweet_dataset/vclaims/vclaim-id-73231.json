Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., offered tentative support for the idea, a panelist on Fox News\u2019 Outnumbered expressed her view that the policy is misplaced.\n\n\"They keep blaming America for the sin of slavery. But the truth is that throughout human history slavery has existed,\" said conservative pundit Katie Pavlich. \"And America came along as the first country to end it within 150 years. And we get no credit for that.\"\n\nEither Pavlich is saying that America was the first country to end slavery, or the first country to end it within 150 years. Either read of history is wrong\u2014and her attempt at a clean up also missed the mark. Pavlich declined to comment for this story.\n\nSlavery in the United States began in 1619 with the arrival of a Dutch ship that carried 20 African slaves to the British colony of Jamestown, Va. Slavery continued through the nation\u2019s founding in 1776.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln\u2019s 1863 Emancipation Proclamation can be considered the beginning of the end of slavery in America, though slavery wouldn\u2019t be formally outlawed across the United States until after the Civil War in 1865.\n\nIn terms of dates of abolition, Spain (1811, except Cuba), Portugal (1819, and later its colonies in 1858) and France (1848) are among the countries that banned slavery earlier.\n\nPavlich\u2019s comments were panned on Twitter. In response to critics, the pundit amended her on-air comments. But that only led to more tweet-checks.\n\n\"Should have said one of* first countries, from the point of founding,\" Pavlich tweeted. \"My argument stands, but please @soledadobrien please continue name calling as your argument and the smearing of America as the originator of slavery.\"\n\nBut that, too, got the facts wrong.\n\n\"Your argument still stands,\" Princeton historian Kevin Kruse tweeted, \"but it\u2019s still completely wrong.\"\n\nKruse listed more than a dozen countries that abolished slavery earlier in their country\u2019s history than the United States did, including Mexico, Argentina and Brazil. Kruse told PunditFact that he compiled the historical data to rebut similar claims about slavery that have been made before.\n\nPavlich said, \"America came along as the first country to end (slavery) within 150 years.\"\n\nThe United States was not the first country to end slavery in terms of calendar year, and at least a dozen countries outlawed the practice earlier in their nation\u2019s history than the United States did.", "lang": "en"}
