[1]\n\nLabor leader Michael Daley described his initiative as a luxury tax [2], but AAP FactCheck has looked into AADA CEO David Blackhall's assertion it will apply to rural and regional Australians who spend that much on work vehicles like the Toyota LandCruiser [1].\n\nIn 2018, the Toyota LandCruiser was the top seller for the Upper Large SUV segment in Australia with 13,677 sales, according to Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries figures. [3]\n\nNeither the chamber, nor Toyota was able to provide specific figures on sales for rural and regional NSW when contacted by AAP FactCheck.\n\nHowever, in 2012, Toyota said: \"Over the 60 years in Australia Landcruiser has become an integral part of rural community life. Landcruiser has helped rural communities take on life in the demanding outback with confidence.\" [4]\n\nNSW Farmers president James Jackson told AAP FactCheck his members bought brands like LandCruiser \"for safety and practical reasons, not for reasons of luxury.\"\n\nThis was backed by motoring group NRMA, with a spokesperson telling AAP FactCheck: \"LandCruisers are workhorses - they\u2019re fundamental to people on farms and in regional areas.\"\n\nToyota markets the LandCruiser as being built for tough conditions.\n\n\"Whether you\u2019re travelling cross-country, crawling through rivers or battling in the bush, there\u2019s absolutely no doubt that LandCruiser 200 is engineered to handle the rough stuff,\" it states. [5]\n\nThe manufacturer\u2019s retail prices for the LandCruiser range from the base model GXL at $67,740 to the LC200 Sahara 4.5 litre diesel at $119,930. [6], [7].\n\nThese prices don\u2019t include additional safety features like blind spot monitors or bull bars which could push the total above the proposed new tax threshold.\n\nMr Daley plans to raise the stamp duty on cars priced above $100,000 from five to seven per cent [8], [2]. The increase would be on top of the federal government\u2019s luxury car tax of 33 per cent for every dollar above $66,331, and 10 per cent GST [9].\n\nIt would also put NSW ahead of Queensland and Western Australia to have the nation\u2019s highest stamp duty on cars. [10]\n\nIn relation to the tax, the definition of \"luxury\" is based on cost alone, with no reference to the features of the vehicle, nor its end use.\n\nAAP FactCheck concludes some LandCruisers do cost in excess of $100,000 and would therefore attract the additional \"luxury\" tax.\n\nHowever, there was only anecdotal evidence to support the claim LandCruisers are widely used in rural and regional areas for work purposes.", "lang": "en"}
