The claim is false; the footage in fact shows police arresting a knife-wielding man in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo.\n\n\n\nThe video was published on Facebook here on March 22, 2020. The video, which includes superimposed text that reads \"Caarona Update\", has since been viewed more than 957,000 times.\n\nThe post's Urdu-language caption translates to English as: \"Pakistanis do not take it as a joke.
