It allows the seizure of weapons by law enforcement from people in the prohibited categories.\n\nThere\u2019s no record of anyone questioning the existence of the database, which has been praised by gun control advocates.\n\nBut a decade after it went into effect, the tracking system has a backlog of thousands of cases.\n\nEnter Rep. Loretta Sanchez. The Orange County congresswoman is Harris\u2019 closest competitor for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer. All three are Democrats.\n\nSanchez told Capital Public Radio during an in January 2016 that Harris has squandered state resources, and hasn\u2019t even produced a database.\n\n\"So the Legislature gave the Attorney General $25 million to match up those people who were felons versus those people who were buying guns. Just a database, so that we could weed out what was going on with respect to those people who shouldn\u2019t be able to purchase guns \u2013 by existing law. Nothing was done. I mean, $25 million was spent, but we don\u2019t have that database,\" Sanchez said.\n\nWe decided to focus on whether the database exists, and check on how the state funds have been spent.\n\nThe database is officially called the Armed Prohibited Persons System, or APPS. It was created in 2001 after the Legislature passed , a Republican-authored bill, in response to gun violence across the nation.\n\nIt cross-references all handgun and assault weapon owners in California against criminal records. It\u2019s designed to check for individuals who legally purchased or registered a firearm but later committed a crime that would prevent them from owning the gun. Law enforcement agents are charged with tracking down the individuals and trying to confiscate their weapons.\n\nThe database became active in December 2006, according to Harris\u2019 office, or four years before she was elected attorney general.\n\nIn this Nov. 16, 2012 Associated Press file photo, California Attorney General Kamala Harris speaks during a news conference in Los Angeles.\n\nWhile the database is not public, it is real. It\u2019s been tied to a and is the subject of reports by the Attorney General\u2019s Office, articles by the press, and letters by gun rights groups and gun control advocates.\n\n\"Yes. It does exist,\" said Michelle Gregory, a spokeswoman for the Attorney General\u2019s Office. \"These (enforcement) agents are working these cases every day. \u2026 It\u2019s definitely a lot of work. It\u2019s time consuming.\"\n\n\"The database absolutely exists,\" added Mike McLively, an attorney with the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nWe asked the Sanchez campaign to explain her claim.\n\nA campaign spokesman argued that it\u2019s correct \u2014 if you add words that greatly change the original statement:\n\n\"To date, we don\u2019t have that database as it was promised by the (State) Department of Justice in 2013,\" the spokesman wrote in an email.\n\nAs a refresher, here\u2019s what Sanchez said originally: \"Nothing was done. I mean, $25 million was spent, but we don\u2019t have that database.\"\n\nIt\u2019s a clear misstatement to say \"we don\u2019t have that database.\" But we wanted to see what progress Harris has made reducing its backlog, to better examine Sanchez\u2019s claim that \"nothing was done\" and that \"$25 million was spent.\"\n\nIn 2013, the Legislature and Gov. Jerry Brown approved $24 million in additional funds to reduce the long list of cases. It had grown to more than 20,700 at the time, according to Harris\u2019 office. Earlier that year, a Harris aide seemed to suggest that the backlog could be eliminated in a single year, according to from the time.\n\nThat same year, the attorney general pledged to hire 36 enforcement agents with the money. Two years later, only half as many had been hired due to what Harris\u2019 office called \"hiring challenges.\" And while state investigations helped clear nearly 7,000 names off the list, the overall backlog had shrunk by only one-fifth during that time, to about 17,500, according to a by the Attorney General\u2019s office.\n\nA sample of the firearms seized through the state's APPS program.

It said the list is now down to about 12,700 cases, which the office called \"a historic low.\" The report makes clear that the list is not static. More than 20,000 people were added to it during the past two and a half years, while about 7,800 dropped off due to death or other reasons.\n\nSOURCE: California Attorney General's SB 140 Supplemental Report of the 2015-2016 Budget Package. The above figures represent the end of fiscal year numbers. *This data represents the first six months of FY 15-16.\n\nSince the additional funding was approved in 2013, state agents have removed more than 20,500 people, and doubled the average number of guns seized per year, according to the most recent report.\n\nThe office has spent $15 million of the $24 million, according to the Attorney General\u2019s Office. The office\u2019s authority to spend the remainder expires May 1, though Harris has asked the Legislature to create a permanent funding stream for the program.\n\nRep. Loretta Sanchez said in a recent interview that California Attorney General Kamala Harris has done \"nothing\" to address a backlog of cases in a high-profile gun ownership tracking system. The database allows law enforcement to seize guns from people with criminal records and mental illness.\n\n\"So the Legislature gave the Attorney General $25 million to match up those people who were felons versus those people who were buying guns. Just a database, so that we could weed out what was going on with respect to those people who shouldn\u2019t be able to purchase guns \u2013 by existing law. Nothing was done. I mean, $25 million was spent, but we don\u2019t have that database,\" Sanchez said.\n\nNot only does the program exist, but some progress has been made. The backlog has been cut from more than 20,000 cases to 12,700. That\u2019s after Harris\u2019 office spent $15 million of $24 million allocated by the Legislature and governor.\n\nSome continue to argue that the cases should be cleared more quickly, citing the mass shootings that have continued across the country. But there\u2019s no denying that the Attorney General\u2019s Office, under Harris, has put a dent in the backlog, allowing for the seizure of thousands of guns. And that\u2019s far from \"nothing.\"\n\nWhile there\u2019s room to criticize the pace of the program, Sanchez\u2019s statement amounts to a complete misrepresentation of reality.\n\nWe rate the claim Pants On Fire.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
