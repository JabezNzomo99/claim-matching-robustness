The foundation\u2019s Akinpelu Oyeleke, a corporate communications officer, told Africa Check the claims were not a direct quote by Adegoke.\n\n\u201cIt may have been culled from an existing publication, referenced by the foundation and shared in a press kit,\u201d he wrote in an email.\n\nBut is the foundation right about low grade 6 literacy and unqualified teachers?

Africa Check has asked if the figure includes both public and private primary school teachers but the foundation has not responded.\n\nrequires that a teacher has at least a national certificate in education, or NCE, to be qualified to teach in primary school.\n\nIn 2016, according to\n\ndata, 550,262 teachers, or 72% of the 764,596 teachers in both public and private primary schools, had an NCE.\n\nThis ratio rises to 86% when only public primary school teachers are considered.\n\nThis means 28% of all primary school teachers, and 14% of teachers in public primary schools, do not have an NCE. We therefore rate the claim as incorrect.\n\n\u2018Unqualified teachers have nothing to offer pupils\u2019\n\nJulie Ibiam, a professor of childhood education at the\n\nin Nsukka, pointed out that the percentage of unqualified primary school teachers varies across Nigeria\u2019s states, with the northern regions worst affected.\n\n\u201cIf teachers are unqualified, then what do they have to offer children?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cThese days, there are so many NCE colleges that claim to be approved, but they aren\u2019t. In the university I lecture, there are teachers on sandwich programmes who can\u2019t write proper English.\u201d (\n\non the foundation\u2019s site with the\n\nGeoffrey Njoku, a communication specialist at Unicef, directed us to the\n\nfor the most recent statistics on literacy in Nigeria.
