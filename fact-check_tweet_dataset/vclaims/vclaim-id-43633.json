No, that's not true: a liberal satire website made up the quote with the intent of it getting picked up and believed by conservatives and Trump supporters on social media so fans of the site could then mock them for it online. Shortly after publication the hoax was copied by at least one Macedionian fake news website that omitted the satire disclaimer and most of the hints it was not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by America's Last Line of Defense on September 15, 2018 titled \"Michelle Obama: Abortion Is Ok Because 'You Can Just Make Another Baby'\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nOn Friday, Michelle Obama said perhaps the worst thing she has said since she was ashamed to be an American. At a private event with Planned Parenthood's new president, Obama defended the abortion provider's stance on killing babies. \"A woman deserves to have the right to choose what to do with her own body,\" Obama said as the audience cheered. \"It's not a man's decision. It's certainly not the decision of a bunch of white men in Congress.\" \"Making a baby is easy. Raising one isn't. Barack and I have done both things twice,\" she continued. \"If you're not ready, you should terminate the pregnancy. You can just make another baby later.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail so it looked more or less like a real news report:\n\nReaders who clicked through could have seen the phrase in the header of the site that read \"Information you probably shouldn't trust\" and the category the article was placed under, which read \"You'll have to wait for the Snopes debunk to tell if it's satire or not\". All links in the article went to meme images mocking the intelligence of the reader.\n\nThose links were about the only warnings left in the version of the story posted by Macedonian fake news website Proud Patriot:\n\nThe website proudpatriot.us was registered about a week ago by someone from Macedonia according to WHOIS registration records:\n\nThe site that originally posted the hoax comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article which was missing on the copycat site:\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including potatriotpost.us, dailyworldupdate.us and nofakenewsonline.us. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nWe wrote about worstpot.us before, here are our most recent articles that mention the site:\n\u2022 Fake News: Kaepernick NOT Arrested for Publicity Stunt During Anthem in San Fran\n\u2022 Fake News: Nike Did NOT Cancel Kaepernick Contract After Backlash\n\u2022 Fake News: Colin Kaepernick Did NOT Immediately Lose Nike Endorsement After Anti-White Rant\n\u2022 Fake News: Henry Winkler Did NOT Die, Did NOT Donate Half Of His Estate To MAGA 2020", "lang": "en"}
