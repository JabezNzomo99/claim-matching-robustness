Our goal is not to relitigate the matter, but to compile major findings from some of the most extensive reporting done on the issue.\n\nFor weeks, Warren struggled to own the narrative, giving more fodder to her opponents. Our colleagues on The Fix wrote in detail the twists and turns of her response, including a reference to a relative\u2019s \u201chigh cheekbones\u201d at one point. Warren explained that \u201cbeing Native American has been a part of my story, I guess since the day I was born, I don\u2019t know any other way to describe it.\u201d\n\nA genealogist at the New England Historic Genealogical Society initially had said there was documented evidence that Warren was 1/32 American Indian, alluding to a family newsletter that had indicated her great-great-great grandmother was Cherokee, the Boston Globe reported early in the controversy. But this point was later corrected, as neither the Globe nor the genealogical society had proven the existence of that document.\n\nExhaustive reporting by several different outlets surfaced no official documentation that Warren was Cherokee. But whether Warren is fractionally of Native American descent \u2014 especially if the fraction is something like 1/32 \u2014 is hard to prove without a DNA test. And even positive DNA results would not be useful for tribal affiliation or to obtain a Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood, according to a report in the Atlantic:\n\n\u201cNone of this to say that a Cherokee citizen couldn\u2019t look like Warren. Though it confounds many people\u2019s expectations, the Cherokee Nation considers being Cherokee as much an ethnicity as anything racial, and given the tribe\u2019s centuries-long history of intermarriage there are many Cherokee citizens today who do not look stereotypically Native American. As well, \u201cthere are a lot of folks who are legitimately Cherokee who are not eligible for citizenship,\u201d said [Lenzy] Krehbiel-Burton, [spokeswoman for the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma] because, for example, their ancestors lived in distant states or territories when the rolls were drawn up, or because they are direct descendants of people left off the rolls for other reasons.\u201c\n\n[Update, Oct. 15, 2018: In response to a challenge by President Trump that she take a DNA test proving her heritage, Warren released a DNA test that suggests she has a distant Native American ancestor. A report distributed by Warren concludes that there is \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that the senator had Native American ancestry in her family tree dating back six to 10 generations. Much of the media reporting on the test was wrong so please also read our fact check on the test results.]\n\nBrown had accused Warren of using distant Native American ties to gain an unfair advantage in getting hired to coveted faculty jobs at Harvard Law School and University of Pennsylvania Law School. He said in a debate during the 2012 campaign: \u201c[Warren] checked the box. She had an opportunity, actually, to make a decision throughout her career. When she applied to Penn and Harvard, she checked the box claiming she was Native American, and, you know, clearly she\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nThe Fact Checker dug deeply into Brown\u2019s claim from the September 2012 debate, and awarded Two Pinocchios. We found no proof that she ever marked a form to tell the schools about her heritage, nor any public evidence that the universities knew about her lineage before hiring her. (Update: In August, 2018, Warren made her personnel files available to the Boston Globe, in an effort to show that ethnicity was not a factor in her rise as a law professor.)\n\nStill, we found that Warren\u2019s relying on family lore rather than official documentation to make an ethnic claim raised serious concerns about Warren\u2019s judgment. Indeed, she even submitted recipes to a Native American cookbook called \u201cPow Wow Chow,\u201d published in 1984 by the Five Civilized Tribes Museum in Muskogee, Okla. She signed her entries \u201cElizabeth Warren \u2014 Cherokee.\u201dIn September 2012, the Boston Globe tracked down members of Warren\u2019s family to corroborate her claim. But family members offered mixed opinions. The Globe wrote: \u201cIn the absence of documentation, the family\u2019s link to any Native American tribe is a matter of narrative inheritance or folklore, as Warren puts it. Even if Warren has some degree of Native American blood, it is unclear if it would meet conventional standards of what constitutes a minority.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never questioned my family\u2019s stories or asked my parents for proof or documentation. What kid would? \u2026 I was stunned by the attacks. How do you prove who you are? My brothers and I knew who we were. We knew our family stories. But the Republicans demanded documentation and, back at the turn of the century, nobody in my family had registered any tribal affiliation. In Oklahoma, that was pretty common. But knowing who you are is one thing, and proving who you are is another.\u201d\n\nThere is no indication Warren has provided any new documentation or explanation after the release of her 2014 book that changes earlier reporting, and there was no new information provided to The Fact Checker from her staff for an update. But Warren did respond to Trump\u2019s comments in May 2016 on Twitter:\n\nTrump is resurfacing an issue that has been researched extensively by The Fact Checker and many other news outlets, who all came to the same conclusion: There is no documented proof of Warren\u2019s self-proclaimed, partial Native American heritage, which experts have noted is difficult to prove to begin with. Warren has maintained since 2012 that this is an issue of family lore.\n\nWhile some of Trump\u2019s claims are perplexing from a fact-checking standpoint because there is little factual evidence, this is an issue that has been written about to great extent since 2012. We actually know what Trump is referring to in this case, and through our refresher have compiled the main findings. We will not rate Trump\u2019s claim, but urge readers to look into it on their own and decide whether Trump\u2019s attacks over Warren\u2019s background have merit.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note, Nov. 30, 2017: In light of a critical article in The Federalist, we wanted to further explain why we decided not to offer a rating. Ultimately, we found that family members had mixed opinions and Warren has said she was citing family lore, which made it hard to rule one way or the other that Trump was justified in calling her a liar. We did note that the issue raised \u201cserious questions about Warren\u2019s judgment.\u201d Moreover, given that The Fact Checker had already delved deeply into the issue during her 2012 campaign, this article was intended more to explain to the public the origin of Trump\u2019s attacks.", "lang": "en"}
