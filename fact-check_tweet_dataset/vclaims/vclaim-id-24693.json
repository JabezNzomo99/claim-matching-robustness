No, that's not true: the picture does not show Melania Trump, it was not taken this year and it wasn't even taken at the White House. It shows Ivanka Trump at an event in 2018 where she was invited to speak (i.e. she was not hosting it).\n\nThe picture recently went viral again through a Facebook post (archived here) on The Other 98% where it was published on May 12, 2019. The caption on the image read:\n\nMany comments on the image were remarking there was a lack of racial diversity in the photo:\n\nThere are several things wrong with the picture, but most of them have to do with the caption and the context.\n\u2022 It does not show Melania Trump (it shows Ivanka Trump)\n\u2022 It wasn't taken today (or in 2019)\n\u2022 Melania/Ivanka were not hosting the event in question so they had nothing to do with who was or wasn't present.\n\u2022 The group hosting the event consisted of military spouses, not moms.\n\nSo, what did actually happen? Melania Trump did host an event for military mothers at the White House on May 10, 2019.\n\nBut the picture in question was not taken at this event. It was taken at a lunch event in 2018 named the \"Joint Armed Forces of Washington Luncheon\" and it shows members of the Air Force Officers' Spouses' Club of Washington, D.C. Here is another picture from that event:\n\nAnd another one:\n\nAnd here is one showing Ivanka speaking at the event:\n\nLater in 2018 the group picture in question was used in a tweet claiming it was taken at the White House:\n\nAs it was pointed out at the time, the picture was not taken at the White House during the May 11, 2018 event:\n\nThe same conclusion was reached by Snopes:\n\nYet here we are in 2019 and people are using a picture of Ivanka Trump speaking at an event for military spouses she was invited to that took place in The Waterford Springfield hotel in Virginia in 2018 to make comments about Melania Trump hosting an event for military moms in The White House in 2019.
