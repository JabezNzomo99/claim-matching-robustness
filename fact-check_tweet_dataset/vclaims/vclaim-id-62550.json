Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had proposed a bill that would cap the legal voting age at 65:\n\nCortez is the author of congressional bill OU812 which would place an upper age-limit on legal voting within the United States to 65. After that age, no citizen would be able to register or even visit a local polling place, and all people currently above that mark would be permanently struck from the rolls immediately.\n\nBut this item is not a factual recounting of real-life events.
