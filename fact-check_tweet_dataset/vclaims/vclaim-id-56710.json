The woman explains how Muslims attacked Hindu houses and took away their men, and how police have turned a blind eye to their plight. It is being claimed that the incident is from Rajasthan.\n\n\"This video is from Rajasthan. Now it is Rajasthan's turn,\" reads the claim along with the 45-second viral video on which many social media users have criticised the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government for being \"anti-Hindu\".\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim about the video to be misleading. The video is not from Rajasthan but Haryana. At 30 seconds in the video, the woman is heard saying they might have to leave Mewat due to atrocities by Muslims. Mewat (now Nuh) is a district in Haryana.\n\nThe video, posted by Facebook user \"Mintu Pandey\", has been viewed more than 91,000 times and shared over 10,000 times till the filing of this story. The archived version can be seen here. The video is viral on Twitter as well.\n\nUsing related keywords, we found the extended version of the video on the Facebook page of a news portal called \"Metro Plus\".\n\nAt the beginning of the video, the same woman says she is a resident of Punhana and Muslims have attacked their houses and other nearby places. Punhana is a town in Haryana's Mewat district. The description of the video also says that it is from Punhana in Mewat district.\n\nMany Twitter users have also claimed that the video is from Haryana.\n\nWe also found a report by Navbharat Times published on May 14, saying that clashes broke out between two communities at Punhana, leading to several injuries due to stone-pelting. The report says police registered cases against 300 unknown persons.\n\nAnother report by Navbharat Times says that some social institutions in Mewat protested in front of the secretariat against repeated attacks on Hindus over the last two months in the district.\n\nWe could not verify the exact date of the video but it is clear that the incident is from Mewat in Haryana and not Rajasthan as claimed.\n\nAlso Read | CBSE datesheet to be released by HRD Ministry anytime soon\n\nAlso Watch | Did Air India charge passengers three times fare for social distancing?", "lang": "en"}
