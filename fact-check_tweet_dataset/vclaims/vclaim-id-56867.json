No, this is not true. While one lone member of the Italian Parliament did attack Gates in a speech, the word \"arrest\" was never spoken and the Italian government did not call for the Microsoft co-founder's arrest.\n\nClick below to watch the video on YouTube:\n\nHere is a screenshot of the speech:\n\nItalian MP Sara Cunial, an anti-vaxxer, lambasted Gates in the Parliament, drawing on familiar conspiracies about the billionaire philanthropist. Cunial said Italian President Sergio Mattarella should refer Gates to \"the International Criminal Court.\"\n\nSuch a referral could, possibly, spark an investigation into the claims Cunial made in the seven-minute speech before Parliament, but is not a direct call for Gates' arrest. Plus, she's only one member of Italy's parliamentary, multi-party government -- not the government itself. Her speech included debunked allegations that Gates seeks dominion over the human race through depopulation efforts, is involved in schemes to profit off the coronavirus and has connections to purported dangers of 5G wireless technology.\n\nCunial, who was expelled by her own party a year after entering Parliament in 2018, was interrupted with jeers during the speech. But she pressed on, trying to make the case that billionaire Gates, who has donated $300 million to fund efforts to eradicate COVID-19, was looking for \"total control, absolute domination of human beings, transformed into guinea pigs and slaves, violating sovereignty and free will.\"\n\nThere is no basis to such a claim, other than dozens of conspiracy theories, including that Gates -- with the ID2020 Alliance -- is looking to implant tech into people to track health and other data about everybody using quantum tattoos to reprogram immune systems. Lead Stories has called out this claim as false.\n\nCunial packed a lot of allegations into the seven minutes, with remarks critical of Italy's safety measures, such as lockdowns, to protect against the novel coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19. She said that \"corrupted mass media\" was trying to \"anesthetize\" the minds of everyone to Gates' doings by infringing on people's rights and subjecting them to poverty, hunger and the status of \"slaves\" in clear violation of the Nuremberg Convention's principles adopted by the UN after the Nuremberg trials of Nazis.\n\nThe International Business Times on May 18 called the speech \"a bizarre rant.\"\n\nHer first mention of Gates -- a \"vaccine criminal\" -- comes about two minutes into the speech, when she refers to him as \"known philanthropist and savior of the world.\" At that point, she said that, in 2018, Gates \"prophesied\" a pandemic, and she went on to note Event 201 last October -- an event that has drawn conspiracists together over the false idea that it was a prediction of the coming coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe novel coronavirus was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December. Lead Stories has previously debunked the Event 201 claim, noting it was a table-top exercise that had no relation to, or contained any prediction of, the coronavirus.\n\nBut before Event 201, there was a 2018 speech by Gates in which he said preparedness for any future pandemic was woefully inadequate. That is the prohesy Cunial refers to in her speech. Here is how the Washington Post covered the speech in 2018:\n\nAnd here is an animation released by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation of the possibilities he feared:\n\nCunial said Gates has been scheming for years with people and institutions through their vaccination efforts to kill off a huge percentage -- 10 to 15 percent, according the MP -- of the population:\n\nThat has also been shown to be false by Lead Stories.\n\nShe also claimed that Gates sterilized millions of women in Africa through vaccines -- an allegation debunked by Africa Check in February 2019 -- and that he is responsible, through vaccines, for causing the crippling of hundreds of thousands of children in India. Lead Stories has also debunked this claim.\n\nOn 5G, Gates, who now works with Microsoft as an adviser, may well advise the adoption of 5G. But Microsoft, just on May 14, acknowledged it's full speed ahead with the company's plans to deploy the technology. That said, there is no evidence that 5G is more harmful than current wireless technology, as Lead Stories has shown over and over.\n\nAnd there is simply no evidence that Gates, who pushes for global health care, has an interest in control over the globe.\n\nIn any case, in a call for Mattarella to refer Gates to the ICC, she said:\n\nNo such referral has been made. Plus, the ICC clearly states on its site:\n\nRT, a global and 24-hour news outlet that \"creates news with an edge for viewers who want to Question More...with a Russian viewpoint on major global events\" had this to say about Cunial's speech:", "lang": "en"}
