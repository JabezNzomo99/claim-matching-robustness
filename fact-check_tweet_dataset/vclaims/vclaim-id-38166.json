The claim is false; Facebook said the claim is untrue, calling it a \"scam\".\n\nThe claim was shared on Facebook here on February 20, 2020.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the misleading post:\n\nThe post\u2019s Thai caption translates to English, in part, as: \u201cDon\u2019t forget tomorrow will be the first day that Facebook implements the new rule where they can use your photos freely. Your photos can be used in court cases in litigation against you. Everything you've ever posted becomes public from today, even messages that have been deleted or photos that are not allowed to use in public. It costs nothing for a simple copy and paste, better safe than sorry.\u201d\n\nSimilar claims were published here, here, here and here on Facebook and here and here on Twitter.\n\nThe claim was also shared in English here, here, here and here on Twitter.\n\n\u201cI can confirm that the viral post in question is not true,\u201d Manaschuen \u2018Tukata\u2019 Kovapirat, Facebook\u2019s communications manager for Thailand and Laos, told AFP via email on February 24, 2020.\n\n\u201cProtecting people's privacy is central to Facebook. People can view and adjust their privacy settings at any time and also use the Privacy Checkup tool to help them control who can see what they share, how their information is used and how to strengthen their account security.\u201d\n\nIn a Facebook community help forum on January 28, 2019, the platform also said claims of such a new policy circulating were \"likely a scam\".\n\n\u201cI'm sorry to hear that you experienced this and thank you for sharing your question with the Community,\u201d Facebook said. \u201cIt sounds like the message you saw is likely a scam.\u201d\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post on the forum:\n\nThai news website Brand Buffet also refuted the false claims in this report dated February 24, 2020.\n\nThe article\u2019s headline translates to English as: \u201cFacebook says viral post \u2018Rules for using images or information\u2019 is not true. Users can set Privacy settings in the system.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
