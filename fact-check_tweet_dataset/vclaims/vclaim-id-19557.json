It\u2019s the life in your years.\u201d\n\nThe saying does not appear in any of Lincoln\u2019s written works.\n\nMany web pages that post memorable quotes attribute this saying to Lincoln, but The Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence that he ever made this statement. It does not appear in his collected works.

According to the website Quote Investigator, he used a similar expression in a couple of speeches during the 1950s.\n\n\u201cThis quote is often misappropriated to Lincoln,\u201d says Daniel Worthington, director of the Papers of Abraham Lincoln, in an email to TheDCNF. \u201cIt actually comes from an advertisement in the Chicago newspaper from 1947.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the closest match for the saying appears in an advertisement for Edward Stieglitz\u2019s book on aging in a 1947 edition of the Chicago Tribune, though Quote Investigator found numerous variations of the expression in print as early as 1889.\n\nHarold Holzer, a leading scholar on the 16th president, also described the quote as apocryphal.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
