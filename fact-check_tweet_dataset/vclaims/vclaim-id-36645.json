The post is accompanied by a link. Vishvas News investigated and found that the viral post is fake.\n\nA post shared on Facebook by a user named Deep Sandeep reads: Honda is giving away 372 Free Honda Activa 5G Scooters to EVERYONE on its 72nd ANNIVERSARY. Hurry Up! Get your free scooter. The post is also accompanied by a link. You can check the archived version of the post here.\n\nVishvas News started its investigation by breaking down various elements of the viral post.\n\nFirstly, we checked the link \n\nACTIVA.SPECIALOFFER.XYZ mentioned in the viral post. We searched and found that the official website of Honda is honda.com and the portal specifically dedicated to Honda two-wheelers in India is honda2wheelersindia.com.\n\nThe url mentioned in the viral post is definitely not the official website of Honda.\n\nSecondly, we investigated further by clicking on the viral link. Upon clicking on the link, we were redirected to a page that asked us to confirm our age. Here is the screenshot of the page:\n\nWhen we clicked on \u2018I confirm\u2019, we were redirected to another website which was prompting us to install to a video streaming service.\n\nClicking on \u2018Continue\u2019 it asked us to install the application on our web browser.\n\nOnce installed, the extension will hijack your browser and replace your default search engine with its own.\n\nNo matter what site you are redirected to, you will never get to claim the Honda scooter. No scooters are being given away by Honda.\n\nThe scammer used the logo very similar to the wings logo of Honda to mislead people and to prompt them to click on the link given in the viral post.\n\nVishvas News contacted Honda and an official named Sameer of the customer care department said: \u201cThis is a fake message getting viral on social media. Honda has not made any such offer. No such information is available on Honda\u2019s official website.\u201d\n\nWe also checked for Honda\u2019s Anniversary by visiting its official website. Seeing the timeline of event, we landed on a page which stated that in 1948 Honda Motor Co., Ltd. was formally established. Honda Motor Co., Ltd. was established with co-founders Soichiro Honda and Takeo Fujisawa and introduced (in 1949) it\u2019s first original designed and engineered product which Mr. Honda appropriately names the \u201cDream\u201d D-type motorcycle.\n\nThis shows that Honda is celebrating its 72nd Anniversary in 2019 but is not giving away free scooters.\n\nConclusion: The post shared on social media claiming that Honda is giving away 372 Free Honda Activa 5G Scooters to everyone on its 72nd anniversary is fake.", "lang": "en"}
