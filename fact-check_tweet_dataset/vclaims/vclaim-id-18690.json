Several Pakistan politicians have also joined the race to post misleading videos on social media.\n\nOn August 18, 2019, Ali Haider Zaidi, federal minister for maritime affairs in Pakistan, tweeted a video of police lathicharge, claiming that it depicts atrocities on women in Kashmir.\n\nThe minister wrote on Twitter, Let the world see what @narendramodi Govt is doing in #Kashmir The #Hitler from the East rises while the world sleeps. @realDonaldTrump should consider imposing trade sanctions on India to control this monster before it\u2019s too late! #SaveKashmirFromModi #IndianHitlerModi\n\nThe tweet has been liked by more than 6,300 users and retweeted over 5,000 times till the time of filing this story. The archived version of the tweet can be seen here.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake news War Room (AFWA) has found the claim to be totally false. The incident is two years old and not from Kashmir but Haryana.\n\nThe video has been available on social media since 2017, clearly establishing that it has nothing to do with repealing of Article 370.\n\nThe viral video posted by Ali Haider Zaidi is 1 minute and 53 seconds long.\n\nThere are visuals of police lathicharging men and women. At 1 minute and 14 seconds, an injured woman with a baby is seen lying with another elderly woman.\n\nThe voice of a sobbing woman can be heard in the background of the entire video. The woman appeals to share the video in large numbers so that it reaches Narendra Modi and the culprits are captured.\n\nHow we got the clue\n\nA Bengaluru-based CRPF officer, Kashyap Kadagattur, replied to the Pakistan minister\u2019s tweet, saying it is not Kashmir. He claimed the video is of police action against the followers of Dera Sacha Sauda in Haryana.\n\nNews reports confirm that Panchkula in Haryana witnessed the worst kind of violence on August 25, 2017, when followers of Dera chief Baba Ram Rahim ran amok in the city after he was convicted of rape by a court.\n\nWe found that several YouTube Channels such as GSA Gallery and NYOOOZ TV had posted videos claiming them to be of police lathicharge on Dera followers around that date in August, 2017.\n\nThe woman\u2019s sobbing voice-over is missing in these old YouTube videos. This clearly means that the viral video is doctored. Screen grabs from the viral video and the ones from YouTube are similar.\n\nRight at the beginning of the viral video, at 3 seconds, a red car can be seen. The number plate of the car begins with CH as seen for a split second. This proves the car is from Chandigarh.\n\nA car with Chandigarh number plate does not definitely zero in on the location of the incident but various other clues confirm that this is the video of police lathicharge on Ram Rahim followers in Haryana.\n\nTruth about the second portion of the viral video\n\nThe second part of the video which shows a bleeding woman with a kid on her lap and another elderly woman lying beside her is also an old video of 2018 and of a different incident altogether.\n\nAccording to reports by local Telugu news channels such as CVR News and also by The Times of India, a police sub-inspector in Telengana was caught on camera beating his wife, child and mother-in-law after his extramarital affair came to light.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that the viral video posted by Pakistan minister Ali Haider Zaidi is a doctored one made by clubbing together old videos of two different incidents. These videos are not even distantly related to Kashmir.", "lang": "en"}
