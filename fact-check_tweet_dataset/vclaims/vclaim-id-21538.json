That\u2019s including housing costs, and is roughly 700,000 people.\n\nThese levels have been roughly the same for the past decade, and slightly higher than other UK countries. The most recent figure for England is 22%, 20% for Northern Ireland and 19% for Scotland.\n\nAn alternative measure is absolute poverty. This is where, instead of comparing people relative to the rest of the population, people are measured against a fixed standard of living. The government chooses to use the relative poverty line in 2010/11, adjusted for inflation.\n\n22% of people in Wales lived in absolute poverty between 2013/14 and 2015/16. Again, that\u2019s including housing costs and about 700,000 people. It\u2019s still higher than 21% in England, 20% in Northern Ireland and 18% in Scotland.\n\nFor both relative and absolute measures, the figures before housing costs are taken into account are a little bit lower.\n\nThere are issues with using both absolute and relative measures of poverty to understand inequality in the UK.
