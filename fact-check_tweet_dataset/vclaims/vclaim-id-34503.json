Karlan told us she did not attend either event.\n\nPosts circulating on social media make the unsubstantiated claim that two different photos of women \u2014 one wearing a pink Pussyhat, the other dressed as \u201cvagina lady\u201d at a 2007 race \u2014 show one of the four legal experts who recently testified in the House impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.\n\nThe claims center on Pamela Karlan, a Stanford University professor of public interest law and co-director of Stanford Law School\u2019s Supreme Court Litigation Clinic, who provided testimony to the House Judiciary Committee on Dec. 4. She was one of three experts called to testify by Democrats.\n\nBut there\u2019s no evidence to support the assertion that Karlan is either of the women in the pictures shared by Facebook users.\n\nOne of the photos shows a demonstrator who is wearing a pink Pussyhat. Reverse image searches eventually led us to the original photo, taken by Agence France-Presse photographer Robyn Beck and available through Getty Images. It was taken in Washington, D.C., during the first Women\u2019s March following Trump\u2019s inauguration in January 2017.\n\nThe picture appeared in many news stories in 2017 and none identified the woman as Karlan.\n\nLikewise, we couldn\u2019t find evidence that the woman in the other viral photo \u2014 who is wearing a costume and carrying a \u201cvagina lady\u201d sign \u2014 is Karlan.\n\nWe traced that picture to a Flickr account that posted the photo in 2007. The photo appeared in an album of pictures from \u201cBay to Breakers,\u201d a footrace held annually in San Francisco. The caption on the picture was simply, \u201cOne of two ladies in vagina costumes.\u201d\n\nKarlan told us that she isn\u2019t in either photo. \u201cI was at none of those events,\u201d she said in an email to FactCheck.org.\n\nThe viral claims followed testimony in which Karlan argued that Trump\u2019s actions \u201cconstituted an abuse of power\u201d \u2014 an alleged offense that now serves as the basis for one of the articles of impeachment announced Dec. 10.\n\n\u201cIf we are to keep faith with the Constitution and our Republic, President Trump must be held to account,\u201d Karlan said in her opening remarks at the Dec. 4 hearing.\n\nDuring Karlan\u2019s testimony, some Republicans sought to raise questions about Karlan\u2019s political motives. Rep. Matt Gaetz, for example, asked Karlan about her campaign contributions to Democrats, including recently to 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, which she acknowledged.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
