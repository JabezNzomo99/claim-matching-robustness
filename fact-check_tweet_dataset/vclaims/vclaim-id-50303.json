The same assertion returned in March 2020 in English, mostly via Canadian Facebook groups amid increased unrest at the Greece-Turkey border. The claim is false; the photo is real, and was taken after a ship sank off the Turkish coast in 2015, as a video from Turkey\u2019s coast guards shows.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you hate it when that One Guy stands up and ruins your Drowning Refugee photo.\u201d This caption was written above a photo of dozens of people floating in water, nearly all of them wearing life vests. In the background of the photo, a red arrow points to a black-clad man without a life jacket whose entire torso is lifted out of the water, giving the impression that the water is in fact shallow enough for the man to stand in it.\n\nA reverse image search leads to the original photo, in a Turkish news article recounting how a ship full of refugees sank on December 16, 2015 in the Aegean sea between Bodrum, Turkey, and the Greek island of Kos, less than five kilometers from the nearest Turkish coast.\n\nA video of the refugees\u2019 rescue shot by Turkish coast guards from a different angle confirms the photo\u2019s authenticity.\n\nAFP showed the video to Bernard Barron, president of the sea rescue station (SNSM) in Calais, France, who admitted he had thought the photo \u201ccould be hoax\u201d when he first encountered it.\n\n\u201cBut when I watch the video, we can see debris floating in the water on the right side of the image (see screenshot below). If this debris is what I think, a board, it\u2019s possible that the man in black is riding it,\u201d Barron told AFP.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a fishing ship floating on its side, it\u2019s also possible, depending on the depth of water, that the man in black is holding himself upright on the hull,\u201d Barron said, adding that fishing ships such as those used to smuggle migrants across the Aegean sea can take up to several hours to fully sink.\n\nAccording to a December 16, 2015 press release, Turkish coast guards were warned at 6:59am about a group of migrants 3.9 nautical miles (7.2 kilometers) southeast of the Turkish island of Karaada, just across from Kos. The press release does not specify whether or not the skiff was experiencing trouble.\n\nAccording to this document, the coast guard arrived at 7:56am and rescued around 60 people. Four bodies were found.\n\n\u201cThe boat apparently did not sink suddenly, because the people on it had time to put on their life vests,\u201d Barron said, adding that the vests visible in the photo take time to put on, particularly for children.\n\nAccording to Barron, the sinking must have occurred shortly before the photo was taken, because the migrants are close together, and currents tend to disperse people very quickly, even in a calm sea.\n\nAFP Factuel first debunked this claim in the summer of 2018, after several French posts pointed to the man at the back of the photo as alleged proof that news companies stage dramatic content to create empathy and pity towards refugees. The claim also circulated in English on Facebook and Instagram in 2019.\n\nIn March 2020, many Canadian Facebook groups and pro-President Trump groups began to share the photo again using screenshots of a February 2017 tweet. This came as Turkey and the EU met for tense talks over the terms of a deal to keep migrants away from Europe's borders.\n\nOne Facebook user from northern British Columbia particularly pushed the narrative, posting it in multiple Facebook groups over 24 hours.\n\nIn late February 2020, Turkey, which the International Migration Organization says hosts one of the largest migrant and refugee populations in the world, said it would no longer prevent migrants from going to Europe.", "lang": "en"}
