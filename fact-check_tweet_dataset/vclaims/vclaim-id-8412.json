On Sunday he shared on social media several claims about undocumented immigrants.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump came away empty-handed for now after the longest federal government shutdown in American history failed to pressure Congress into funding his long-promised border wall, purportedly to stop an inflow of drugs and crime from Mexico. But he is not done making his case on immigration. On Sunday he rattled off several figures on Twitter about how many undocumented immigrants there are in the United States, how much they cost the country financially and how many had illegally voted in Texas. There were already many problems with Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that undocumented immigrants disproportionately bring with them more drugs and crime. And several experts said they had concerns with the figures he disseminated on Sunday. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. In one tweet on Sunday, Mr. Trump said that \u201c58,000 non-citizens voted in Texas, with 95,000 non-citizens registered to vote.\u201d He was citing an investigation that Texas officials had publicized days earlier but that Democrats in the state immediately questioned.\n\nThe investigation, by the Texas secretary of state\u2019s office, said that 95,000 people who were registered to vote in the state had at some point told a law enforcement agency that they were not citizens. Out of that number, 58,000 had voted at some point since 1996. Politicians and voters\u2019 advocates are asking officials to investigate both figures. \u201cBecause we have consistently seen Texas politicians conjure the specter of voter fraud as pretext to suppress legitimate votes, we are naturally skeptical,\u201d Representative Rafael Anchia, a Democrat in the state House, told The New York Times. Even if the numbers are deemed accurate, those 58,000 voters could have become citizens before casting ballots. More than 50,000 people were naturalized in Texas in 2017, according to the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cWe have a reason to distrust these numbers,\u201d said Andre Segura, the legal director for the A.C.L.U. of Texas. \u201cThere\u2019s a long history of these numbers being inaccurate. Voter fraud is extremely rare.\u201d In Florida, the administration of the former governor, Rick Scott, had tried to purge noncitizens from voter rolls in 2012. It started with a list of 180,000 voters based on driver\u2019s license data, according to The Tampa Bay Times. Ultimately, 85 people were removed from the rolls, according to the newspaper.\n\nIn another tweet, Mr. Trump said that \u201cthe cost of illegal immigration so far this year is $18,959,495,168. Cost Friday was $603,331,392.\u201d It is not clear where Mr. Trump arrived at those figures. They track with a tweet from last month in which he declared that the country loses \u201c250 Billion Dollars a year on illegal immigration.\u201d But several experts said those figures were far too high. There is little research on how much undocumented immigrants cost the United States. The highest costs would generally be related to education and health care, but many undocumented immigrants pay taxes and are typically barred from receiving many of the costliest benefits, like Medicaid. No study seems to comprehensively address a net cost, instead focusing on either the costs or the benefits. \u201cThey tend to talk past each other, unfortunately,\u201d said Randy Capps, the director of research for American programs at the Migration Policy Institute. The National Academy of Sciences concluded in 2016 that immigration, both legal and illegal, benefited the economy. It said that the average immigrant cost state and local governments about $1,600 a year from 2011 to 2013, but that their children and grandchildren paid far more in taxes than they consumed in public services. Alex Nowrasteh, a senior immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute, said the highest figure he had seen came from the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which favors restricting immigration. It has said undocumented immigrants cost the country at least $116 billion per year.\n\nThe Cato Institute disputes that figure, which Mr. Nowrasteh said did not take into account the economic benefits of undocumented immigrants. He and others have questioned the group\u2019s methodology. \u201cThere\u2019s no basis to any of those numbers about the fiscal cost,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president\u2019s numbers are even twice as bad.\u201d\n\nNumber of undocumented immigrants in the country Mr. Trump also claimed that in the United States there are \u201cat least 25,772,342 illegal aliens, not the 11,000,000 that have been reported for years.\u201d Again, several experts said Mr. Trump\u2019s numbers were too high. It appears that Mr. Trump is making his claim based on a study conducted by researchers affiliated with Yale University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which estimated the number at 22 million. Starting with an estimate in 1990, the researchers modeled how the population would change in future years based on immigration rates, demographic change and deportations, among other factors, eventually arriving at the 22 million estimate. The conclusions of that study, published in the journal PLOS One in September, have been challenged, with some questioning whether it underestimated the number of immigrants who had left the country.", "lang": "en"}
