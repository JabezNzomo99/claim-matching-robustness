The post has garnered close to 5,000 shares.\n\nAnother video of the same woman, where is she is inquired by the mob about the number of abducted children and their whereabouts, is also circulating on social media. Facebook user Vikram Singh shared this video with a similar narrative.\n\nAlt News looked at multiple news reports related to incidents where people mistaken for child-kidnappers were caught in Uttar Pradesh. We found that this woman was held hostage by a mob in Dimrauni village of UP\u2019s Jhansi district. A YouTube Channel Bharat News 24 Live claimed that the woman was a child-lifter. The reporter in the video is speaking to the woman in Badagaon police station.\n\nOn August 3, Amar Ujala reported that the woman held captive by a mob in Dimrauni village over suspicion of her being child-kidnapper was later handed over to the police. Contrary to the above report, Amar Ujala\u2019s report said that the police has declared her to be mentally ill.\n\nAlt News contacted Badagaon police station to confirm the incident and inquire about its status. We were informed that the incident is at least 15-20 days old and the woman was a mentally-challenged person. The villagers had mistaken her for being a child-lifter. SI RK Pandey said, \u201cwe have not arrested any child-kidnapper recently.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
