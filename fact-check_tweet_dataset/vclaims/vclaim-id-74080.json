A Google Reverse Image search was done by breaking the video into individual frames which led to youtube where the video was uploaded on July 16, 2020.\n\nAmit Shah announced that he tested positive for COVID-19 on August 2. Therefore, this video is not related to the Union Home Minister's health condition.\n\n Further, the video was also posted last year In December on Facebook. \"Amit Shah has died,\" reads the caption of the post.\n\nTherefore, a video from Kolkata dating back to December 2019 is being circulated with a false claim. Considering the time of upload and the Azaadi slogans being raised in the video, It seems the incident is related to anti-CAA protests that happened all across the country in that time.\n\n\n\nIf you have any news that you believe needs to be fact-checked, please email us at factcheck@thelogicalindian.com or WhatsApp at 6364000343 Also Read: Fact Check: Bihar Police Officer Will Not Be Joining CBI Probe Into Shushant Singh's Death", "lang": "en"}
