Jeb Bush of Florida.\n\nShe wrote, \"Despite what the media is telling you, it is clear that Carly deserved to be on the debate stage, both according to their arbitrary metrics \u2014 and the ones that actually matter:\n\n\"In an actual contest of voters, Carly came out ahead of Governors Christie and Kasich.\n\n\"She has the same number of delegates as Governor Bush. Governor Christie has 0.\n\n\"Carly is 6th in hard dollars raised and has more cash on hand than Governors Kasich and Christie combined.\"\n\nFiorina never managed to snag a spot at the debate, but we decided to take a look at the third of Fiorina\u2019s bullet points -- the one about about her fundraising totals.\n\nFor fundraising data, we turned to opensecrets.org for the latest presidential fundraising data.\n\nHere\u2019s the table, in descending order, for hard dollars raised, defined as money raised by the candidate\u2019s own campaign committee. The most recent data available at the time of her Feb. 6 statement was through Dec. 31, 2015. (Opensecrets.org does not have data for one Republican candidate still in the race, former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore.)\n\nSo Fiorina was indeed sixth on the list. That\u2019s not saying a whole lot -- she was ahead of only two candidates, and she had barely half the amount of the fifth-place finisher.\n\nHow about cash on hand, which means money raised minus money already spent?\n\nFiorina was right that she had more cash on hand than Kasich and Christie combined; they totaled $3,663,459. Here too, that\u2019s no great shakes -- she still ranks sixth of the eight candidates in cash on hand\n\nFiorina said she \"is 6th in hard dollars raised and has more cash on hand than Governors Kasich and Christie combined.\" While it\u2019s worth noting the context that she ranks far back in the pack, Fiorina is right on both counts, according to the most recent public filings.
