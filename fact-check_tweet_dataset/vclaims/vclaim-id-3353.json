The body, established by the 2010 constitution, adjudicates public pay in Kenya.\n\nIn a country with a population of more than 40 million people, do the deputy president\u2019s startling numbers stack up? We checked.\n\nHow many workers does the Kenyan public service have?\n\nAfrica Check contacted Ruto\u2019s office for the source of his numbers. His spokesman David Mugonyi promised to provide information, but is yet to do so. (\n\nIn his speech, Ruto variously put the number of public workers at \u201c700,000\u201d, \u201cless than 10% of the population\u201d and \u201c2%\u201d, saying that they took up 52% of the money generated by the Kenya taxpayer.\n\nThe salaries commission\u2019s newly-released report does not state the number of employees in the public service. Chairperson Sarah Serem instead referred us to the\n\n, which hires public workers. We have contacted the hiring agency.\n\ngave the same figure of 737,100 employees as having been paid from public funds in the 2016 calendar year. This was an increase of 2.6% from 2015 when they numbered 718,400. In 2012 this number was 662,100, or nearly 10 times the independence figure of 63,000 employees, according to the pay agency.\n\nRuto\u2019s figure, while understated, falls within this ballpark.\n\nHow much tax money did the country raise?\n\nIn the 2016/2017 financial year, Kenya\u2019s treasury\n\nKS1.253 trillion from taxes (96% of the total) and KSh52.8 billion from non-tax sources, such as fines and money that government institutions receive and are allowed to keep to meet costs.\n\nWho pays taxes in Kenya?\n\n\n\n Deputy President William Ruto in his speech said there were 40 million Kenyan taxpayers. \n\n\n\n , the state agency that collects taxes, 8.1 million taxpayers are registered in its Personal Identification Number (PIN) database. Of these, 2.9 million active taxpayers, the agency said in \n\n\n\n people as having been in formal (or registered) employment in 2016. A further 13.3 million people were in informal employment, making up 83.1% of the 16 million people captured as being employed that year. \n\n\n\n Outside of income tax, other taxes include Value Added Tax (VAT) of 16% which is in Kenya, according to the revenue agency. \n\n\n\n told Africa Check it is not possible to know exactly how many Kenyans pay consumption taxes, such as VAT and excise duty. \n\n\n\n \u201cAlthough retailers must use Electronic Tax Register machines as required by the government, these machines can only tell you how many transactions have been carried out, but not who did them,\u201d he said. \n\n\n\n that children who have not attained the age of 13 years may not be employed for any reason. At least 13.6 million children are 9 years and under, according to 2017 population estimates provided to Africa Check by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics\n\nIn the same financial year, the public wage bill\n\n, according to the December 2017 report Ruto launched.\n\nThis was an 8% increase from the KSh627 billion paid to public service workers in 2015/16 and translates to 54% of the income from taxation. In 2012/13 the wage bill was at KSh465 billion, or a third less.\n\nThis proportion largely supports Ruto\u2019s statement that half of tax revenue is paid as salaries.\n\nConclusion: Salaries take up at least half of Kenya\u2019s tax collection\n\nWhile highlighting the drain on Kenya\u2019s resources by a high public wage bill, deputy president William Ruto said 700,000 workers cost half of the money raised from taxation.\n\nData from the Economic Survey 2017 by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics shows that 737,100 employees were paid out of the public purse during the 2016 calendar year\n\nKS1.253 trillion was from taxes and KSh52.8 billion from non-tax sources.\n\nIn its most recent report of December 2017, the Salaries and Remuneration Commission said that\n\nthe public wage bill during the 2016/17 financial year\n\nWe thus rate Ruto\u2019s claims as mostly correct.", "lang": "en"}
