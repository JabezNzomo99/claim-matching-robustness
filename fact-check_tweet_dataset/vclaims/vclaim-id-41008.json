The tweet has been fabricated.\n\nThe Netflix docuseries \u201cTiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness\u201d focuses on former Oklahoma zookeeper Joseph Maldonado-Passage, also known as \u201cJoe Exotic.\u201d His nemesis in the show is Big Cat Rescue owner and animal rights activist Carole Baskin, whose second husband, Don Lewis, disappeared in August 1997.\n\nMaldonado-Passage was sentenced in January to 22 years in prison for attempting to hire someone to murder Baskin, plus multiple violations of wildlife laws, according to the Justice Department. In late March, the former zookeeper requested a presidential pardon from Trump and announced a lawsuit seeking $94 million in damages from several government agencies and former colleagues, the New York Post reported.\n\nThe alleged tweet, which has been shared over 250 times on Facebook, masquerades as an March 30 announcement from Trump, saying, \u201cI would like to announce immediately that due to the Chinese Virus outbreak I have decided to pardon Joe Exotic (Tiger King) and will have General Attorney Barr look into the bitch Carol \u2018Fuckin\u2019 Baskin for the disappearance of her husband Don.\u201d\n\nHowever, the tweet appears to have been fabricated. The Daily Caller didn\u2019t find the announcement on Trump\u2019s verified Twitter accounts, and ProPublica\u2019s archive has no record of him deleting it.

Nor has the Justice Department indicated it will look into Baskin or the disappearance of Lewis, whose case remains open despite being declared legally dead in 2002.\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 8, New York Post reporter Steven Nelson asked Trump if he was considering a pardon for Maldonado-Passage, mentioning that Donald Trump Jr. had joked about lobbying the president for the pardon.", "lang": "en"}
