That\u2019s certainly the case with health care, where both parties have played games with the numbers.\n\nThis statement by former Florida governor Jeb Bush is a particularly instructive example. It started with a misleading claim by then-Sen. Barack Obama, campaigning for the presidency in 2008. It then has morphed into a recurring GOP claim that has repeatedly been proved false by The Fact Checker, FactCheck.org, and PolitiFact. And yet here it is again.\n\nBut Obama\u2019s pledge came with a very large asterisk: He was not saying premiums would fall by $2,500, but that health-care costs per family would be that much lower than anticipated. In other words, if overall costs \u2014 not just premiums \u2014 were expected to rise by $5,000 by 2012, they would only rise by $2,500. We should note that Obama was not especially clear about that aspect of the estimate \u2014 and as shown in the video he frequently misstated it.\n\nWhen Obama made this claim in 2008, he was quickly called out by fact checkers. The Fact Checker awarded Obama Two Pinocchios for the pledge, saying that it was based on shaky assumptions (such as a Rand Corp. study that was criticized by the Congressional Budget Office) and that there was no guarantee any cost savings would be passed on to consumers.\n\nThe health-care plan that emerged from Congress was significantly different than Obama\u2019s campaign proposal. Yet the White House in 2011 offered a re-estimate that the plan would yield $2,000 in savings by 2019. In 2014, Obama even began to claim that \u201cthe average premium for family coverage today would be $1,800 higher\u201d if not for his health-care plan \u2014 a statement that also yielded Pinocchios. (It is very difficult, even at this date, to determine how much the slowdown in health-care costs is attributable to the Affordable Care Act. The Great Recession resulted in a general slowdown in health-care costs around the globe.)\n\nBut Bush, like previous Republicans who have tried to make this argument, stumbles because he is comparing Obama\u2019s pledge with something different \u2014 actual projected increases in premiums. As we noted, Obama\u2019s campaign pledged to reduce the rate of growth for health-care costs, not an actual cut in premiums.\n\nA Bush spokesman said he was relying on a recent projection from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) that private insurance premiums will rise by nearly $2,900 per enrollee by 2024. That\u2019s also different than the Obama estimate, because that was per family. (Other Republicans, in making a similar claim, have been careful to cite increases in family premiums to date, so Bush is being especially sloppy here.)\n\nHealth costs have climbed every year and were always expected to increase; the question was whether the Affordable Care Act would slow the rate of growth in premiums. During Obama\u2019s presidency, the United States has experienced unusually low rates of growth in health-care premiums, about 5 percent per year, almost half the pre-recession rate.\n\nThe CMS analysis says that premiums per enrollee will increase 5.4 percent in 2014, in part because of the expansion of health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act. (An unrelated factor is expensive new prescription-drug treatments for hepatitis C.) But the increase would drop to an annual rate of 4.1 percent in 2018 in part because of other Obamacare provisions. Eventually, more robust economic growth will help boost premiums by about 5.8 percent per year over the nine-year period studied in the report. But, the increases are still \u201cexpected to be substantially lower than the average rates that were observed in the three decades prior to the recession,\u201d the analysis said.\n\nBush in this instance does not even bother to use per-family premiums or even what has happened so far under the law, but chooses a projection far in the future. That makes the comparison even more misleading.", "lang": "en"}
