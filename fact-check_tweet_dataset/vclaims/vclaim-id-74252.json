Her mother is from India and her father from Jamaica \u2014 but Harris was born in Oakland, California.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, announced on Twitter on Aug. 11 that his vice presidential running mate is California Sen. Kamala Harris.\n\nBut multiple posts on Facebook falsely claim that \u2014 in the event Biden is unable to serve out his term \u2013Harris is ineligible to serve as president because she\u2019s an \u201canchor baby\u201d whose parents are immigrants.\n\nDays before Biden had even announced his choice of running mate, the posts said: \u201cJoe Biden chose Kamala Harris as his VP.\u201d The posts go on to claim, \u201cIf crazy Joe cannot serve his full term, Kamala cannot by constitutional law become President. She is an anchor baby, mother is from India, father is Jamaican, and neither were american citizens at time of her birth. That means the Presidency would fall on Speaker of the house. Recently Nancy Pelosi stated that she was next in line to become President. THAT in itself is reason to vote her out in November. Democrats have worked the whole scenario out and I believe that is why they chose Kamala Harris.\u201d\n\nIn an email to FactCheck.Org, Josh Chafetz, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center who specializes in constitutional law, described the Facebook posts as \u201cracist nonsense.\u201d\n\nChafetz explained: \u201cTo serve as president, one must be at least 35 years old, have been a resident of the United States for at least 14 years, and be a \u2018natural born Citizen\u2019 (Article II, sec. 1 of the Constitution). Additionally, one cannot have already been president for more than a term and a half (22nd Amendment).\u201d\n\nAs we\u2019ve reported before, Harris, whose mother is from India and whose father is from Jamaica, was born in Oakland, California, which makes her a natural born U.S. citizen and eligible to serve as president. She was born Oct. 20, 1964, according to the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress.\n\nChafetz added that the fact that Harris\u2019s parents are immigrants is \u201cwholly irrelevant.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.
