Starting at AGE 60. Gift from DU30!\" the fake story carried a video that stops playing after about 15 seconds and requires viewers to \"share\" it on Facebook to continue.\n\nWhen opened on Youtube, the video is actually a United News International report uploaded Feb. 21, 2017 on its official channel that talks about how the Department of Social Welfare and Development's Social Pension Program doubled its coverage from 1.3 million beneficiaries in 2016 to 2.8 million that year.\n\nSenior citizens will not be receiving P6,000 monthly, but annually -- or P500 monthly. The new program, however, only covers indigent seniors, which its enabling law Republic Act 9994 defines as persons 60 years old and above who are:\n\n*without any pension from other government agencies; and\n\n*without a permanent source of income or source of financial assistance/compensation to support their basic needs.\n\nThe stopping video is a modus reflected by other fake news reports such as death hoaxes and sex scandal spoofs.
