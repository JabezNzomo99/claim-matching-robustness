Oddly, these statistics have circulated for decades, persistently, despite the efforts of researchers to debunk them as ridiculously inaccurate. One reason is because the statistics have been promoted by supposedly reputable organizations, such as Oxfam and UNDP. But people also often want to believe facts that appear to confirm their own biases.\n\nWe\u2019ve embedded a copy of the relevant text at the end of the column, but her explanation is maddeningly imprecise. She says she relied on \u201cvarious UN statistics,\u201d \u201cavailable global data,\u201d and \u201cfragmentary indicators at the time.\u201d As Cohen put it, the statistics turned out to be \u201ca guess based on an extrapolation wrapped round an estimate.\u201d Yet Ahooja-Patel even suggested that women might own \u201cmuch lower\u201d than 1 percent of world assets.\n\nIn the case of Oxfam, officials pointed to a July 2011 \u201cFast Facts\u201d publication by UNDP. Sure enough, in the right-hand corner, under \u201cMatters of Fact,\u201d is this statement, with no attribution: \u201cWomen perform 66 percent of the world\u2019s work, produce 50 percent of the food, but earn only 10 percent of the income and own only one percent of the property.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Laura Rusu, a spokeswoman for Oxfam America, said: \u201cWe believe that statistics are important to spark the public conversations that lead to action to address the challenges of poverty and injustice around the world. But we also recognize that such statistics only work if they are accurate, so we are no longer using these numbers.\u201d\n\nThe claim that women have just 10 percent of worldwide income also is ridiculous. Women clearly earn less than men, but as Cohen noted, women in the United States by themselves are responsible for more than 5 percent of worldwide income. A study by ActionAid in Britain found the total value of the global employment participation gap and the wage gap between women and men is $17 trillion; that suggests women have about a 36 percent share of global income, measured in purchasing power parity terms. A UNICEF study in 2007 suggested women had a 23.5 percent share. That\u2019s a wide enough gap to take a jaundiced view of many of these figures, but both are much higher than 10 percent.\n\nDoss has also looked at the question of how much food women produce. (The Oxfam graphic said 50 percent, but activists have also claimed 60 and even 80 percent.) \u201cQuite frankly, I don\u2019t know what this statistic could mean and how we could actually assign a number to the amount of food produced by women,\u201d Doss said. \u201cHow do we figure out who produced the food when men and women both work on the same plots, producing some crops together?\u201d\n\n[Update: Ahooja-Patel initially did not respond to requests for comment. But on March 28, she wrote The Fact Checker: \u201cPlease understand that the knowledge of statistics we have now in 2015 is not the same as what we knew earlier, especially in the 1970s and 80s. Some of the statistics we were looking at in that period were estimates and the national statistical offices of the period did not cover women\u2019s issues or data. The land question is extremely important and as you will understand the property laws have also changed meanwhile and so have the qualitative and quantitative measurement of land.\"]\n\nIt\u2019s good that for the first time Oxfam and UNDP have acknowledged that they have peddled false information. But they need to take a proactive role in setting the record straight. Any papers or Web sites that had previously used these figures need to be prominently corrected. It\u2019s not enough to simply kill a link. The message should be clear: This is a bogus, Four-Pinocchio statistic unworthy of citation.", "lang": "en"}
