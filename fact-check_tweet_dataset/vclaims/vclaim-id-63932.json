The unemployment rate in the United States quadrupled from January to April \u2014 from 3.6 percent in January to 14.7 percent, according to data on the 25 richest members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) assembled in June by Harry J. Holzer of Georgetown University for the Brookings Institution. That\u2019s an increase of more than 300 percent.\n\nCanada, Holzer noted, had an increase of 136 percent, going from 5.5 percent to 13 percent unemployment in the same period. No other industrialized country in the sample had as high an unemployment rate or as steep an increase.\n\nHolzer\u2019s report noted that the numbers are not necessarily comparable because of \u201cdifferences in measured unemployment rates reflect differing measurement rules and timing, as well as some real policy differences.\u201d At least 15 countries \u2014 including the United States \u2014 have limited their unemployment increases by subsidizing firms to keep workers on payrolls. Moreover, \u201cfor quirky measurement reasons, at least 3 countries \u2014 Canada, Israel and Ireland \u2014 report larger increases in Unemployment Insurance receipt but much smaller increases in unemployment than the U.S.\u201d\n\nHis study also looked at how the United States compared to its peers in terms of total cases and deaths, as well as new cases and deaths per capita. Only two countries \u2014 Singapore and the Czech Republic \u2014 had higher numbers of cases per capita than the United States, while only six countries had higher numbers of deaths per capita than the United States.\n\n\u201cWhat do these numbers imply about the U.S. experience, and the administration\u2019s role, in handling of the crisis to date?\u201d wrote Holzer. \u201cBecause it waited a very long time to begin shutting down the economy and imposing emergency measures, U.S. workers ultimately lost very large numbers of jobs by April. \u2026 These delays no doubt aggravated the ultimate severity of the crisis, in both economic and health terms.\u201d\n\nThe president argues that easing these restrictions over time would open the door to Iran\u2019s attaining nuclear weapons capability, rendering the JCPOA ultimately ineffective. But supporters of the Iran deal dispute that and say the JCPOA at least buys time, subjecting Iran to strong constraints on its nuclear activities for 10 to 25 years.\n\nFormer national security adviser John Bolton, in his tell-all memoir, \u201cThe Room Where It Happened,\u201d described one of Kim\u2019s letters as \u201cpure puffery, written probably by some clerk in North Korea\u2019s agitprop bureau, but Trump loved it.\u201d After another such letter, Trump even mused that he wanted to invite Kim to the White House \u2014 what Bolton called a \u201cpotential disaster of enormous magnitude.\u201d\n\nBolton wrote: \u201cWe drafted a letter Trump signed the next day, offering up [Secretary of State Mike] Pompeo in Pyongyang. Trump said he didn\u2019t like the idea, which he thought was insulting to Kim: \u2018I disagree with you and Pompeo. It\u2019s not fair to Kim Jong Un, and I hope it doesn\u2019t ruin things,\u2019 he said as he wrote in his own hand at the bottom of the letter, \u2018I look forward to seeing you soon.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBob Woodward\u2019s upcoming book, \u201cRage,\u201d promises to reveal more when it is published in September. \u201cWoodward obtained 25 personal letters exchanged between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that have not been public before,\u201d the book publisher says. \u201cKim describes the bond between the two leaders as out of a \u2018fantasy film,\u2019 as the two leaders engage in an extraordinary diplomatic minuet.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
