Both publications confirmed this with the picture\u2019s photographer Aleksandr Petrosyan.\n\nPetrosyan also told the Telegraph that the man wasn\u2019t crying because he was the last remaining member of his group, but because he could not catch up with a column of other veterans. Mr Petrosyan also told the Telegraph he didn\u2019t speak directly to the man.\n\nAnd the BBC cites Dr Igor Sutyagin, a Russian military historian, to confirm that one of the medals the man is wearing is \"The Order of the Patriotic War\", an award given to those who played a role in the Soviet Army in World War Two.\n\nHowever, attempts to find the man have reportedly been unsuccessful, so we have been unable to confirm the man\u2019s background.", "lang": "en"}
