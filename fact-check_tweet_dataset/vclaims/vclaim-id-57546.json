They say it's of no use to them now...\" The archived version of the post can be seen here.\n\nIndia Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the pictures to be misleading. The one-year-old pictures are from Venezuela.\n\nThe misleading post has been circulating like wildfire on social media. With the help of reverse search, we found that these pictures are available on the Internet since March 2019, several months before the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nA report by \"Snopes\" says these pictures were taken in Venezuela in March 2019. The currency seen lying on the streets is Venezuela\u2019s old currency, the Bol\u00edvar Fuerte, which was replaced by a new form of currency, the Bolivar Soberano, in August 2018. Venezuelans threw their old notes on the streets as they became worthless for them.\n\nIt was also reported that people in Venezuela looted a bank and then burned the money to show that it was worthless. Many journalists had tweeted pictures with the same information.\n\nTill 7pm on Tuesday, Italy reported more than 11,000 coronavirus deaths and over one lakh infections. But the viral pictures are old and have nothing to do with the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIndia Today Fact Check is part of IFCN Alliance on Covid-19", "lang": "en"}
