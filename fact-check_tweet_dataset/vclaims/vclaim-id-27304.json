In fact, the U.S.-backed military operation in Afghanistan has prevented both the Taliban from ousting the government in Kabul and the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan, ISIS-K, from expanding its operations in greater Central Asia.\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition and Afghan forces are also making progress in degrading ISIS-K.\n\nU.S. Navy Captain Bill Salvin, the spokesperson for U.S. troops and NATO\u2019s Resolute Support mission, said in March that the goal was \u201cto defeat ISIS-K\u201d in Afghanistan this year.\n\nThe following month, Salvin said that Afghan and coalition forces had reduced ISIS-K-held territory by two-thirds and the number of its fighters by at least half since the group emerged in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe should applaud U.S. efforts to cut down the presence of IS fighters in Afghanistan,\u201d Michael Kugelman, a South Asia expert with the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson Center, told VOA's Afghan service.\n\nOn Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a new U.S. strategy for Afghanistan, which, he said, will include a \"clear definition\" of victory: \"attacking our enemies, obliterating ISIS, crushing al-Qaeda, preventing the Taliban from taking over the country, and stopping mass terror attacks against Americans before they emerge.\"\n\nTrump also urged Pakistan to do more to eliminate terrorist sanctuaries on its soil and India to provide Afghanistan with more economic and development support.\n\nWhile he did not provide any details about how many more troops will be deployed to Afghanistan, according to congressional officials, the administration will send in approximately 4,000 additional U.S. troops.\n\nBesides bolstering Afghan and regional security, the U.S. presence in Afghanistan has also helped advance democratic institutions, human rights, and economic opportunities in the country.\n\nAs the University of Massachusetts \u2013 Dartmouth\u2019s Williams told Polygraph.info in March, millions of refugees have returned to Afghanistan, millions of Afghan girls once banned from schools are now getting an education, fields have been de-mined and thousands of wells dug.\n\n\u201cWomen are in parliament and even the police force for the first time. There have been the first democratic elections in the country's history,\u201d Williams said.\n\nAccording to the Pentagon's Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), the United States has obligated an estimated $714 billion for all spending, including war fighting and reconstruction, in Afghanistan since 2001.", "lang": "en"}
