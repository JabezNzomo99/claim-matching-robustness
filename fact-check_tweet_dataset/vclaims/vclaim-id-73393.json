Let\u2019s verify the claim made in the post.\n\nClaim: Video of Muslims taking out a mock funeral procession of Amit Shah in celebration of him testing positive for Covid-19. Fact: This video of mock funeral procession of Amit Shah was found on the internet since December 2019 and has nothing to do with Amit Shah being tested COVID-19 positive. Hence the claim made in the post is Misleading.\n\nOn reverse image search of the screenshots in the video, we found a video with similar visuals in a Facebook post. This video was posted on Facebook on \u201821 December 2019\u2019. In the video, we could hear Muslims chanting \u2018Azadi\u2019 slogans while performing the mock funeral of Home Minister Amit Shah. This video could most probably be related to the anti-CAA protests held during those times across the country.\n\nOn clearly observing the barricades in the posted video, we found that this protest was held in Kolkata.\n\nOn \u201802 August 2020\u2019, Amit Shah through his official twitter account announced that he tested COVID-19 positive.\n\nTo sum it up, an old protest video from Kolkata is being falsely shared as the celebration of Muslims for Amit Shah being COVID-19 positive.\n\nDid you watch our new video?", "lang": "en"}
