No, that's not true. The story was published by a liberal satire website that tries to educate gullible Trump supporters and Republicans about the need to actually click and read links before sharing or liking them in order to avoid being mocked by fans of the site later. The part of the article about the donations being repurposed is not real.\n\nThe story originated from an article published by Be Best Website on December 20, 2018 titled \"GoFundme Wall Donations to be Diverted to Climate Change Programs\" (archived here) which opened:\n\nThe internet has been alight lately with private donors using fundraising site GoFundme among others, to raise money to build the wall on the southern border. Millions of dollars have been raised, despite the Department of Homeland Security rejecting them, since federal agencies are forbidden from receiving private donations. So where does all this money go? That question was answered this morning by Federal Manager of Gullible Simpletons Richard Rekker. \"Since apparently, these dummies are more than eager to give their money away, I say why not use it to fight something actually threatening, like climate change, instead of encouraging these jackasses to believe we can wall off the lower part of the country.\"\n\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail so it would not have been immediately clear the story was just a joke:\n\nHowever there definitely is no \"Federal Manager of Gullible Simpletons Richard Rekker\" and the site has an obvious hint in the header that reads \"Information you probably shouldn't trust to be best\". On top of that there is also the category the article was posted under: \"XENOPHOBIC SATIRE FOR GERIATRIC TATERS\".\n\nIf all that wasn't enough the site comes with a clear satire disclaimer at the bottom of each article:\n\nThe story was mocking the current GoFundMe campaign set up by Brian Kolfage to fund a border wall with private donations:\n\nThat campaign has raised over $8 million in three days and has been shared almost a million times on Facebook. It is currently 0.8% of the way to its stated goal of collecting one billion dollars even though many price estimates for a border wall are well above that amount.\n\nThe owner and main writer of the site posting the hoax about the money being diverted is self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair, a man from Maine who has made it his full time job to troll gullible conservatives and Trump supporters into liking and sharing his articles. He runs several other websites, including potatriotpost.us, dailyworldupdate.us and nofakenewsonline.us. Sometimes he is also known under his nickname \"Busta Troll\". A second man working on the sites is John Prager as revealed in this earlier story we wrote.\n\nArticles from Blair's sites frequently get copied by \"real\" fake news sites who often omit the satire disclaimer and any other hints the stories are fake. Blair has tried to get these sites shut down in the past but new ones keep cropping up and he keeps knocking them down.\n\nBlair and his operation were profiled by the Washington Post on November 17, 2018 by Eli Saslow:\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Blair and the history of his sites, here is something to get you started:\n\nIf you see one of his stories on a site that does not contain a satire disclaimer, assume it is fake news. If you do see the satire disclaimer it is of course also fake news.\n\nNewsGuard, a company that uses trained journalist to rank the reliability of websites, describes bebest.website as:\n\nAccording to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability.
