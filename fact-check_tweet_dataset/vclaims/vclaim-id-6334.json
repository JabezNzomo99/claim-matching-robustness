That\u2019s where four or more are killed. Two hundred and seventy. We cannot accept this as normal. We cannot become desensitized.\"\n\nHillary Clinton made her claim about mass shootings during a speech Oct. 9, 2017 at UC Davis.\n\nPolitiFact California took a deep look at how mass shootings are defined here, and found there\u2019s wide disagreement on the matter.\n\nDemocrats and gun control advocates use the very broad criteria that a mass shooting includes four or more people killed \u2014 or injured \u2014 in one event. It was developed by the Gun Violence Archive, a group that logs shootings across the country by crowdsourcing media reports.\n\nUnder its definition, which does not require that anyone is necessarily killed, there have been more than 270 mass shootings so far this year.\n\nBut there have been far fewer of these crimes where, as Clinton termed it, \"four or more people are killed.\"\n\nA database compiled by Mother Jones, a liberal magazine, shows there have been only three mass shootings so far this year that meet the four-or-more measurement expressed by Clinton at the speech.\n\nThe magazine itself shows seven mass shootings so far this year because it uses three or more deaths as its criteria. It excludes more conventional crimes such as armed robberies and gang violence in its count, focusing instead on \"the distinct phenomenon of mass shootings.\"\n\nThe Gun Violence Archive, meanwhile, which includes gang shootings and home invasion robberies as mass shootings, had tallied 19 shootings in which four or more people were killed.\n\nIn the past, the federal government has used the more restrictive criteria of four or more killed to define a mass shooting. We found there\u2019s no widely accepted definition that doesn\u2019t create its own share of questions.\n\nA spokesman for Clinton pointed to the Gun Violence Archive\u2019s definition for mass shootings, but did not immediately provide an explanation for Clinton\u2019s misstatement of that definition.\n\nHillary Clinton in her UC Davis speech said there have been more than 270 mass shootings in the United States so far this year. She defined the events as \"where four or more are killed.\"\n\nOur research has shown that a broad definition of mass shootings requires four or more people to be killed or injured. There have been more than 270 of those horrific crimes so far this year.\n\nBut Clinton left out the key words \"or injured,\" dramatically changing the criteria for these shootings. There have been a much smaller number of mass shootings that meet this stricter criteria of \"four or more people killed,\" nowhere near the 270 she claimed.\n\nFALSE \u2013 The statement is not accurate.", "lang": "en"}
