And since 2001.....STAY WOKE PEOPLE!!\" Other versions that have been debunked went even further and questioned why the dog vaccine isn\u2019t being used in humans.\n\u2022 The vaccine is for dogs, not humans.\n\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nThe term \"coronavirus\" refers to a large family of viruses that are known to cause various illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 at the center of the current pandemic was discovered in 2019. It had not been previously identified in humans. No vaccine for it could have been developed before that.\n\nThe vaccine in the photo is real, but it\u2019s for canine coronavirus disease, known also as CCoV.\n\nMerck Animal Health makes the vaccine and now includes a note on its webpage explaining that canine coronaviruses \"are not the same virus as SARS-CoV-2 that is responsible for causing the COVID-19 infection.\"\n\nAccording to VCA Animal Hospitals, which operates nearly 800 animal hospitals in the U.S., the canine coronavirus comes from the Coronaviridae family and is a \"highly infectious intestinal infection in dogs, especially puppies.\"\n\n\"There are many types of coronavirus, each affecting different animal species, including humans. Canine coronavirus (CCoV) is not the same virus as SARS-CoV-2,\" which causes COVID-19, the company says. \"CCoV does not affect people. CCoV causes gastrointestinal problems in dogs, as opposed to respiratory disease.\"\n\nA vaccine is available for dogs with canine coronavirus, which causes gastrointestinal issues. It is not for prevention of COVID-19 in humans; there is no vaccine for that.", "lang": "en"}
