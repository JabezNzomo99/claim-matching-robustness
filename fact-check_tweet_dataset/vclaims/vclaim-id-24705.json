The caption with the post reads: Kejriwal sir giving sermons to the people of Delhi. (Hindi: \u0915\u0947\u091c\u0930\u0940\u0935\u093e\u0932 \u0938\u0930 \u091c\u0940 \u0926\u093f\u0932\u094d\u0932\u0940 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928 \u092c\u093e\u091f\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0941\u090f). The video shows Kejriwal sitting in a car and talking to the camera, in a seemingly intoxicated tone, about elections in Punjab.\n\nThe original video, posted on Kejriwal's Facebook profile, can be seen here. The Delhi CM had uploaded the video on January 29, 2017, appealing to the people of Punjab to vote for the Aam Aadmi Party and not Congress. The video has been edited and slowed down thus giving Kejriwal's speech a slur. BOOM had debunked the same video in January.", "lang": "en"}
