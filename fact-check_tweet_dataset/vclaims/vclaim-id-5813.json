Jipping ( here ) similarly presented a series of arguments against Bader Ginsburg\u2019s nomination, among them referencing the same USCCR report co-authored by Bader Ginsburg. He argued that, in this report, Bader Ginsburg\u2019s recommendations included drafting women into the military, legalizing prostitution, constitutionally protecting bigamy, and \u201clowering the age of consent for sexual acts to 12 years.\u201d (See page 12, central column, bit.ly/2PA2xRS )\n\nSex Bias in the U.S. Code, the USCCR report, is visible online bit.ly/3acgDlW ) It was published in 1977, a date also referenced in some of the Facebook claims.\n\nA section beginning on page 95 ( bit.ly/3a3rTkt ) described how the law stood at the time (\u201cUnder 18 U.S.C. 1153 and 2032, it is a crime for a person to have carnal knowledge of a female not his wife who has not reached 16 years of age\u201d) and noted that the legal definition of rape assumed the offender was a man and the victim was a woman. The report argued: \u201cThese provisions clearly fail to comply with the equal rights principle. They fail to recognize that women of all ages are not the only targets of sexual assault; men and boys can also be the victims of rape.\u201d\n\nOn page 102, the report recommended removing the phrase \u201ccarnal knowledge of any female, not his wife who has not attained the age of sixteen years\u201d and replacing it with \u201ca Federal, sex-neutral definition of the offense patterned after S. 1400 section 1633\u201d.\n\nThe report goes on to quote directly from S. 1400, which was a proposed Senate bill ( here ) under which a person would be guilty of an offense if they compelled someone else to take part in sex by force or threats, by drugging or intoxicating them, or if \u201cthe other person is, in fact, less than 12 years old\u201d.\n\nBader Ginsburg was arguing in the report for a broader, gender-neutral definition of rape. The passage that her critics cite as evidence she favored lowering the age of consent is actually a quote from a proposed Senate bill, not from Bader Ginsburg. The focus of Bader Ginsburg\u2019s argument was not on the age of consent, but on removing an antiquated definition that assumed only women could be targets of sexual assault.\n\nBader Ginsburg had put forward the same argument in an earlier report, \u201cThe Legal Status of Women under Federal Law\u201d, co-authored with Brenda Feigen Fasteau in 1974 (see Title 18 section, page 78 of PDF bit.ly/3fDdVqo ). Once again, the paper quotes directly from the 1973 Senate bill, S. 1400, as providing \u201ca definition of rape that, in substance, conforms to the equality principle\u201d.\n\nOver time, the misinterpretations of Bader Ginsburg\u2019s arguments in these reports have led to the type of claims seen in the Facebook posts where direct quotes are falsely attributed to her.\n\nSlate tackled this misinformation when Senator Lindsey Graham repeated the claim in 2005 ( here ), as has the Washington Post ( here ) and Snopes ( here ).\n\nOther iterations of this claim include the attribution of the false quote \u201cpedophilia is good for the children\u201d to Bader Ginsburg.\n\nFalse. This is not a direct quote by Ruth Bader Ginsburg. It stems from a false interpretation by third parties of legal recommendations presented by Bader Ginsburg in the 1970s.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
