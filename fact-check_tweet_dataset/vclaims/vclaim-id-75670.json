On November 14 the NGT rejected the exemptions sort by Delhi government for women drivers and two wheelers from the odd-even scheme.\n\nOn November 11, the National Green Tribunal had approved the Delhi government's decision to implement the scheme but with no exemptions to anyone. It said that odd-even scheme should be implemented when PM 10 crosses microgrammes per cubic metre (\u03bcg/m3) and PM 2.5 crosses 300 \u03bcg/m3 in 48 hours. However, the government withheld the move.\n\nPM 2.5 levels have hit severe levels above 250 \u03bcg/m3 in the past week against the prescribed standard of 60 \u03bcg/m3. Some parts of the city have also recorded PM 2.5 levels of 600 \u03bcg/m3 which is 10 times the prescribed standard.\n\nPM 2.5 are particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers found in the air which upon inhalation can penetrate deep into the respiratory tract and lungs increasing the risks of cardiopulmonary diseases such as asthma, bronchitis and can even lead to a stroke.\n\nTalks on implementing the odd\u2013even scheme had begun as air quality in the national capital had worsened over the past week with the city being engulfed with toxic smog.\n\nBelow is the real-time map of air pollution of November 13, 2017 as monitored by Berkeley Earth, an US organization that keeps track of climate change. It shows PM 2.5 levels in Delhi to have reached 'hazardous' levels and the neighbouring states with 'very poor' levels.\n\nBut how effective is odd-even against pollution in Delhi? Is the AAP government pushing for a highly visible scheme but low on benefits? We bring you a fact file on all the things you need to know about the odd-even scheme and its impact on the pollution levels in Delhi.\n\nWhat is the odd-even scheme?\n\nOdd-even is a car rationing scheme which allows odd and even numbered vehicles to run on alternate days. In India, this was introduced by the Aadm Aadmi Party in New Delhi as a measure against rising air pollution in Delhi.\n\nThe national capital implemented odd-even in two phases on experimental basis during January 1-15, 2016 and April 15-30, 2016 to see the impact of reduction in vehicular emissions on air quality. However, the scheme applied to only four wheelers. Women, VIP vehicles, public transport, two wheelers, trucks and CNG run private vehicles were exempted.\n\nWhat was the effect of odd-even on Delhi\u2019s air quality?\n\nThe rationing of vehicles through the two phases of odd-even did not make a big difference in the air quality.\n\n\u2018A single factor or action cannot substantially reduce air pollution levels in Delhi\u2019, observed the Central Pollution Control Board.\n\nBelow are comparisons of 24-hour average PM 2.5 levels pre and during odd-even for both the times it was implemented in Delhi.\n\nNote: The PM 2.5 level values are daily averages of all stations across Delhi\n\n24 hr Average PM 2.5 Levels (\u03bcg/m3) of different locations in Delhi\n\nIn both the phases, when odd-even was implemented in Delhi, PM 2.5 levels did not see any decrease. The table above shows that there was a rise in pollution in most areas.\n\nWhy was the odd even scheme not effective in Delhi?\n\nVehicular pollution contributes to only 25% of the air pollution during winter, according to an IIT Kanpur study. And 1/3rd of PM levels in Delhi is due to emissions from sources out of Delhi. Especially during the months of October - November, emissions from crop residue burning in agricultural lands of neighbouring states of Haryana and Punjab moves to Delhi with the wind.\n\nBeing a land locked city, Delhi is at the receiving end of polluted air from neighboring states and has limited options for flushing it out unlike cities like Mumbai which has the sea to its advantage. Thus, pollutants remain trapped in the air making Delhi a gas chamber.\n\nOther main sources of pollution are construction and industrial activities, thermal power stations, burning of municipal solid waste and road dust.\n\nAir quality in Delhi is highly dependent on meteorological factors such as wind speed, mixing height and temperature. Mixing height refers to the height to which suspended particles in the air rises leading to vertical mixing of the air.\n\nHigher the wind speed and mixing height, more the dispersion of pollutants. The opposite leads to suspension of pollutants near the ground.\n\nBelow are graphs for PM 2.5 levels against wind speed and mixing height during the second phase of odd even scheme in Delhi in April 15 \u2013 30, 2016. The graphs show an inverse relationship between PM 2.5 levels with mixing height and wind speed.\n\nNote: The PM 2.5 level values are daily averages of all stations across Delhi\n\nWith PM 2.5 levels having gone up again in the past two days, Delhi government is reconsidering the decision to implement odd-even. Following are the graphs which show PM 2.5 levels in different parts of Delhi between November 1-12, 2017.\n\nThe above data clearly show that while the AAP government is pushing for the odd-even scheme, its efficacy to resolve the pollution problem, which has more than vehicular pollution as its sole source, is yet to be proven. The three state governments of Delhi, Haryana and Punjab are yet to come to a common platform to figure out innovative ways to resolve this problem. Meanwhile, political rhetoric is at its peak with the chief ministers battling it out on Twitter even as Delhi residents suffer waiting for a solution.", "lang": "en"}
