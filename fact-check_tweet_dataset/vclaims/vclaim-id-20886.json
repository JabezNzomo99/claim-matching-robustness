But she made no mention of going to war, rendering untrue the headline \"PINAKA MAINIT NA BALITA !LENI NAGYABANG KUNG SYA LANG DAW PANGUL0 GINYERA NA NYA ANG CHLNA! PANOORIN (Breaking news! Leni brags that if she were the president, she would have already gone to war with China! Watch).\"\n\n\"Shouldn't this be the time for us to peacefully protest any effort to limit or control movement in international waters?\" said Robredo, expressing concern over reports of the Chinese Coast Guard taking away the catch of Filipino fishermen in Panatag Shoal.\n\nThinking-pinas.blogspot.com's fabricated story, which could have reached over 630,000 people, was published two days after Robredo spoke at the forum. Traffic to the story was largely generated for social media by the pages President Rody Duterte Facebook Army and Solid Duterte-Marcos Supporters.\n\nThe blog has been publishing stories since May 22; Youtube channel President Duterte News, which uploaded the CNN clip, since January 2017.\n\n(Editor's Note: VERA Files has partnered with Facebook to fight the spread of disinformation.
