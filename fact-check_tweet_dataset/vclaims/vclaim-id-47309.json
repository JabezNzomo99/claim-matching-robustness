Hanif Jazayeri posted a tweet stating that Iran had placed an $80 million bounty on the head of U.S. President Donald Trump in retaliation for a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad that killed Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani:\n\nThe EN24 website similarly reported that the offer had been made on Iranian state television, and the amount of the bounty was based on Iran\u2019s population:\n\nIn the propaganda war against the United States and its president, the Iranian mullah regime is now using a particularly perfidious tactic. The state television announced during the broadcast of a funeral service for the killed terror general Ghassem Soleimani that $80 million bounty would be placed on US President Donald Trump. The one who kills him should receive this amount. \u201cIran has 80 million inhabitants. Based on the Iranian population, we want to raise $80 million, which is a reward for those who get close to the head of President Trump,\u201d it said on state TV. Each Iranian should therefore donate a dollar to pay the amount to the alleged murderer.\n\nThe video attached to social media reports of the bounty showed large crowds mourning and/or protesting Soleimani\u2019s death, with a male voice said to be that of a eulogist at Soleimani\u2019s funeral procession seemingly calling for the placement of a bounty on Trump\u2019s head:\n\nThe eulogist at the funeral procession of prominent Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani in Iran put an 80-million-dollar prize on US President Donald Trump\u2019s head on live state TV. \u201cWe are 80 million Iranians, if each one of us puts aside one American dollar, we will have 80 million American dollars, and we will reward anyone who brings us [Trump]\u2019s head with that amount,\u201d he said, addressing a large crowd in Iran\u2019s north-eastern city of Mashhad. The funeral procession was being broadcast live on Iran\u2019s Channel One as the eulogist made his proposal.\n\nA Heavy article on the subject stated it was \u201ca little misleading\u201d to say that Iranian \u201cstate television\u201d had announced the bounty, \u201cbecause it was the eulogist who made that announcement, not state TV. It was, however, being broadcast on state TV.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
