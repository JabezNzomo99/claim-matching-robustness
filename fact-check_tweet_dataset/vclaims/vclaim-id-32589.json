Several individual users, over the past few months, have posted the video on Facebook with identical text.\n\nThe video has also been posted on Twitter, with the same text.\n\nThe one-minute long video clip is in the form of an interview. The female figure is called Chloe. The conversation is as follows:\n\nInterviewer: My name is John\n\nInterviewer: Could you tell us a little about yourself and what you can do Chloe?\n\nChloe: Of course. I am the first personal assistant built by cyber life. I take care of everyday tasks like cooking, housework, or arranging your appointments for example\n\nInterviewer: And I understand you are the first android to have passed the Turing test, could you tell us a little more about that?\n\nChloe: I really didnt do much you know, I just spoke with a few humans to see if they could tell the difference between me and a real person. It was a really interesting experience\n\nInterviewer: This is the first time in history that man has created a machine more intelligent than himself; I gather your brain can perform several billion billion operations per second, is that right?\n\nChloe: Absolutely, but I only exist thanks to the intelligence of the humans who designed me, and they have something I could never have\n\nInterviewer: Really? And what\u2019s that?\n\nThe nature of the conversation makes it seem as if Chloe has been designed to be a super-sophisticated robot. Is that really the case?\n\nAlt News found that the cyborg-like female figure in the video is a character in a video game. Reverse-searching one of the frames of the video on Google, we came across a fan website of Detroit: Become Human, a \u201ccinematic neo-noir thriller game\u201d, which has been launched for Playstation 4. In the game, Chloe is an android.\n\nThe character of Chloe has been portrayed by French actor Gabrielle Hersh.\n\nPosted below is a video related to the game, in which the character Chloe can be seen.\n\nIt may thus be noted that the video in question is a promotional feature for a video game, Detroit: Become Human, and not a fembot developed by Japan.", "lang": "en"}
