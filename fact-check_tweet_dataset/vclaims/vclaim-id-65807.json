The posts were reported at least 14 times for containing false information.\n\nThe facts: Time's cover story on Duterte, which was published in May 2018, did not honor him. The video wrongly equated \"strongman\" with someone brave and firm, when in fact it is a term for a leader who controls by force of will and character.\n\nThe cover story discussed how the rise of Duterte, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban indicates that the world is now in the \u201cstrongmen era.\u201d Duterte shared the cover with these 3 politicians.\n\nDuterte even cursed Time for this story and said that he is not a strongman. Bremmer answered in a separate article also published in 2018 and said: \u201cHis (Duterte's) government dismisses evidence of his drug war death toll, substantiated by international rights organizations, as \u2018alternative facts.\u2019 He has tried to harass and intimidate United Nations officials charged with investigating the evidence.\u201d\n\nTime's cover story also did not say that they do not regret featuring Duterte, nor praised his administration for being transparent. The story only mentioned Duterte twice. The full article can be accessed here.\n\nTime has featured Duterte on its covers twice in the past. Both covers highlighted his iron-fisted leadership. The first was in the May 2016 issue of its Asia Edition which called Duterte \u201cThe Punisher\u201d for his violent anti-drug campaign. \u2013 Pauline Macaraeg/Rappler.com", "lang": "en"}
