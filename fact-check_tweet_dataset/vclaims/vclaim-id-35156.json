This claim is false; the images in fact show a promotional event for a gory video game and various animal rights protests promoting a vegetarian diet.\n\nThe images were posted here on Facebook on January 21, 2019. They have since been shared at least 330 times.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the post:\n\nThe Sinhala language caption translates to English as: \u201cWe must be humbly proud of our country. There is apparently a good market for human meat in certain countries. Please find out more and comment.\u201d\n\nThe photos were also shared with a similar claim on Facebook here.\n\nHowever, the claims are false.\n\nReverse image searches on Google found that several of the photos were taken at various international animal rights demonstrations.\n\nThe lead image, which shows purported meat labeled \u201cCARNE HUMANA,\u201d actually shows a protest by activists in Barcelona, Spain in 2016. The photo was published here by Metro, a UK tabloid.\n\nThe article states that the activist group AnimaNaturalis staged a demonstration to encourage people to recognize that animal meat comes from living beings. The protest, the report adds, included staged packages of purported human meat \u201ccomplete with labels reading \u2018CARNE HUMANA\u2019 \u2013 \u2018human meat\u2019\u201d.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photograph in the misleading post (L) and the image from the article (R):\n\nOne of the other photos was taken in 2018 at a protest organised by the Anti-Speciesist Action Collective, an Australian animal rights group. The photo can be seen on the organisation\u2019s website here.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the photograph in the misleading post (L) and the image from the Anti-Speciesist Action Collective website (R):\n\nA closer analysis at another of the images found that it was staged by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), a US-based animal rights groups. The organisation has put on several similar protests as part of its \u201cMeat is Murder\u201d demostrations, which feature blood covered volunteers lying in giant plastic wrapped meat trays.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the image with the PETA logo circled in yellow by AFP:\n\nOther reverse image search found that two of the other misleading photos were taken at a 2012 promotional event in London ahead of the release of the video game \u2018Resident Evil 6\u2019. The photos were featured on various blogs here and here.\n\nBelow are comparison screenshots between the images in the misleading posts (L) and the blog posts (R):\n\nTwo other photos in the misleading post actually show animal meat.\n\nThe image of a butcher shop shows a facility at the Smithfield market in London. It was featured in an article here and is credited to Getty Images.\n\nThe photo of red meat was found to be an image of beef published here by iStock, a stock image database owned by Getty Images. The photo\u2019s caption reads: \u201cFresh ribeye steaks at the butcher shop.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
