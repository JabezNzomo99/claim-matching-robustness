America must be defeated within their politics,\" reads the statement attributed to the deceased Iraqi dictator.\n\nThe Feb. 14 Facebook post goes on to say that Hussein \"was telling the truth and this is exactly what the Democrats are doing by seating one Muslim at a time.\"\n\nIt\u2019s been shared more than 93,000 times and was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nSearching for the quote online we found 10 results, but they were from meme websites like me.me or awwmemes.com,\n\nIn 2006, Hussein testified in his defense against charges of crimes against humanity, and he called on Iraqis to join together to defeat the U.S.-led occupation in Iraq, according to C-SPAN. But in reviewing that testimony, we didn\u2019t read anything like the quote that appears on Facebook.\n\nSearching for the quote in the news archive Nexis we found no results. Nor did we find it searching Google Books, or reviewing online versions of \"Saddam\u2019s War of Words\" and \"The Saddam Tapes,\" which contains annotated transcripts of audio recordings of meetings between Hussein and his allies.\n\nWe reached out to the author of \"The Saddam Tapes\" and others who have studied Iraq and Hussein, but they were all unfamiliar with the quote.\n\nKevin Woods, the book\u2019s author, said \"the idea behind the quote is implicit in many of the discussions between Saddam and Tariq Aziz,\" Hussein\u2019s top aide, but that the quote wasn\u2019t something he recognized.\n\nSamuel Helfont, assistant professor of strategy and policy, U.S. Naval War College, told us in an email that \"it sounds like something he would say, and that was certainly his strategy in the 1990s/early 2000s.\"\n\nAmatzia Baram, a professor of Middle Eastern history at the University of Haifa in Israel, said the only case where he sees Hussein implying an idea like the statement in the Facebook post stems from his 1990 meeting with April Glaspie, then the U.S. ambassador to Iraq. It was a week before Hussein invaded Kuwait, Baram said, and he told Glaspie that since the Vietnam War, the United States can\u2019t afford casualties but Hussein can. (\"Yours is a society which cannot accept 10,000 dead in one battle,\" he told Glaspie, according to Newsweek.)\n\n\"The connotation was that American war policies can be influenced through casualties,\" Baram said.\n\nIf evidence emerges that Hussein made the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post, we\u2019ll reconsider our ruling. But lacking any proof that this attribution is accurate, we rate the post False.", "lang": "en"}
