Your entire existence is drenched in racism.\u201d \u201cRacism isn\u2019t learned. It\u2019s inherited, and consciously or unconsciously passed down through privilege.\u201d \u201cOnce white people begin to admit that their race is the most violent and oppressive force of nature on Earth, then we can talk.\u201d\n\nBut Snopes found no evidence that L\u2019Or\u00e9al shared these comments on their social media accounts or any other medium.\n\nThe controversy began in August 2017, when Bergdorf was hired with much fanfare as the face of the company\u2019s diversity initiative and its first transgender model in a campaign. But her contract was terminated just days later when the The Daily Mail tabloid published sections of a Facebook post reportedly written by Bergdorf.\n\nBergdorf said she made the comments as a reaction to the August 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. L\u2019Or\u00e9al said Bergdorf\u2019s words were at odds with their support of \u201cdiversity and tolerance towards all people.\u201d\n\nIn early June 2020, L\u2019Or\u00e9al posted statements supporting Black people in the wake of the May 25, 2020, police-custody death of George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis died while being forcibly restrained by a white police officer. Soon after, Bergdorf called the cosmetic company out as hypocrites on her Instagram account, recalling that she was fired three years prior for speaking out against white supremacy.\n\nOn June 9, Bergdorf revealed that L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s new president, Delphine Viguier had since reached out to her. Viguier expressed regret for how the 2017 controversy was handled, and Bergdorf accepted Viguier\u2019s invitation to be a consultant on their U.K. diversity board.\n\nSelect quotes from Bergdorf\u2019s 2017 Facebook post were misrepresented by social media users as official statements from L\u2019Or\u00e9al and/or as comments made by her as an adviser to the company. Because Bergdorf admitted to making these comments, but not while as an adviser to L\u2019Or\u00e9al, we rate this claim as a \u201cMixture.\u201d", "lang": "en"}
