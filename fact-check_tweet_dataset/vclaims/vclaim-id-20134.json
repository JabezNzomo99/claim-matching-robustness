Cooper responded, clarifying that the statement did not come from him. \"I did not say this. It's fake.\" On another tweet, he maintained he \"never said\" the quote.\n\nAnderson Cooper and Korina Sanchez had a bit of a run-in when Cooper visited the Philippines in 2013 to cover the devastation left by Typhoon Yolanda. Cooper's critical observations about the shortcomings of local relief efforts did not sit well with Sanchez, who criticized Cooper's observations as totally wrong in her DZMM radio program at the time.\n\nCooper got wind of Sanchez's comments and countered: \u201cMs Sanchez is welcome to go there and I would urge her to go there. I don\u2019t know if she has, but her husband\u2019s the interior minister, I\u2019m sure he can arrange a flight.\u201d \u2013 Addie Pobre/Rappler.com\n\nKeep us aware of suspicious Facebook pages, groups, accounts, websites, articles, or photos in your network by contacting us at factcheck@rappler.com.
