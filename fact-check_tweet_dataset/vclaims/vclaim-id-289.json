The person filming the video scans the woman\u2019s body, before lifting her hand to show the camera (here) .\n\nIn the accompanying Facebook caption, the user says the woman\u2019s relatives were told she had died from COVID-19, but \u201cwhen they forced their way into the morgue she was still alive in the zipped up body bag still breathing\u201d. The caption also implies this was taken in a British hospital by linking it to the UK\u2019s National Health Service (NHS).\n\nIt continued: \u201cNHS your gonna get whats coming to you imagine if it was not for my grandmother and many other nurses who came to this country to help build the nhs and this is how you treat our people in your care.\u201d\n\nBut this was not filmed in the UK, nor does it show proof that a woman was found to be alive after being mistakenly assumed to have died from COVID-19.\n\nThe video can be traced back to Brazil, where it went viral last week with similar claims that the woman had been taken to the morgue when she was still alive (here, here, here).\n\nBrazilian brand names on products seen at various points in the 46-second clip also give clues to the location, including the logo for Brazilian packaging company Descarbox, and a bottle of water emblazoned with the logo for Floratta, a company based in the northern state of Par\u00e1 (www.descarbox.com.br/, here).\n\nOn May 6, the Department of Health in Par\u00e1 released a statement saying the video showed a patient at the Abelardo Santos Hospital in Bel\u00e9m, a hospital currently focused on treating patients with COVID-19 (here).\n\nIt added that the patient, referred to as Mrs A. V. S, had since died, but was \u201cnever referred to the Abelardo Santos morgue while she was alive\u201d.\n\nA piece of paper tucked beneath the woman\u2019s leg in the video shows the first part of her \u201cnome\u201d (Portuguese for \u201cname\u201d) is \u201cAnito\u201d. It isn\u2019t possible to make out the characters in the rest of her name, but this matches up with the first initial provided by the Par\u00e1 Department of Health.\n\nMrs A.V.S had travelled to the hospital\u2019s emergency department on May 4 and was in a \u201cserious condition,\u201d the statement continued. The following day, she was sent to a critical care room after her condition worsened, where she later died.\n\nThe statement also said the grey plastic sheet that Facebook users had identified as a body bag was actually \u201capparatus used as a transfer support between stretchers; a common method in hospitals\u201d.\n\nAccording to the Par\u00e1 Department of Health, an internal investigation has now been launched into how the video was leaked, and said it amounted to \u201can unethical, inhumane attitude liable to criminal punishment\u201d.\n\nFalse. The video does not show a woman being found alive in a body bag in the morgue after her family were told she had died from COVID-19.\n\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.
