But the short clip from a four-year-old video is taken out of context, as a quick video analysis shows.\n\nAn English-language video shared on Twitter by Hungary\u2019s government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs says Belgian MEP Verhofstadt is calling for more migration.\n\nThe video includes dramatic music and a voiceover with an American accent saying:\n\nA quick check with the INVID plugin, a tool to help verify videos and still images, finds a link to the original video, which had been posted in comments below.\n\nIn the original, posted four years ago on Vimeo, Verhofstadt says:\n\n\"I think that we have to develop the fastest as possible a legal migration policy in Europe. We need migration. But we need legal migration. For the moment, we have the opposite. We have illegal migration and human trafficking. So what we have to do is to develop as the Canadians have, as the Australians have done, as the Americans have done, a legal economic migration policy because in a number of countries, certainly in Germany, we shall need bright, young people coming from outside the European Union to build up our economy.\u201d\n\nINVID enabled us to break the video into single frames and search on the Google and Yandex search engines to see where else the video had appeared.\n\nOne frame, with the out-of-context subtitle \u201cwe need migration\u201d, had been shared numerous times in Hungary and also Finland.\n\nThe Hungarian video was also posted on an official website, with the following text to introduce it:\n\n\u201cWe do not want to become an immigrant country. That\u2019s why the government has released this English-language internet video in response to the affronts to our country.\u201d\n\nGuy Verhofstadt later tweeted the Hungarian video, including a link to the original.\n\nThe video was in a similar style and format to others that have accompanied questionnaires put to the Hungarian public by the government since the 2015 migration crisis.\n\nThose videos, in Hungarian, have variously attacked US billionaire George Soros, the EU, and local non-governmental organisations (NGOs) for allegedly supporting immigration.\n\nHuman rights NGO the Hungarian Helsinki Committee has successfully sued the government for defamation over false statements in one of the questionnaire campaigns. The government has appealed that verdict at the Hungarian Supreme Court.\n\nThe Hungarian-born Soros said last year that a government video and billboard campaign that claimed he wanted to settle migrants in Hungary contained \u201cdistortions and outright lies that deliberately mislead Hungarians\u201d.", "lang": "en"}
