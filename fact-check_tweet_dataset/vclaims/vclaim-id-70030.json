The casualties suffered on the Chinese side, on the other hand, has been left to much speculation by the Chinese government thus giving rise to misinformation. While rumours have killed anything between five to 100 People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers, the official death toll remains a mystery.\n\nOn August 31, however, Aaj Tak claimed to have obtained \u2018exclusive\u2019 imagery that proves \u201c40 PLA soldiers\u201d were killed in the cross-border skirmish. Anchor Rohit Sardana claimed in an impassionate narration, \u201cWe are showing you pictures of the graves of Chinese soldiers. Several people in the country wanted proof of the Chinese soldiers who were killed in Galwan clashes. The proof is on your television screens\u2026more than 40 Chinese soldiers died in clashes with India and you can watch how Chinese soldiers paid respect to their tombs.\u201d\n\nAaj Tak\u2019s English counterpart, India Today, also broadcast similar visuals. The channel showed satellite imagery of the same set of graves with two red arrows pointing at specific area claimed to be \u201cnew graves\u201d. Anchor Nabila Jamal claimed, \u201cChina soldiers who died in Galwan clash buried at Kangxiwa war memorial. Pictures of that show graves being visited by PLA soldiers\u2026proof of China\u2019s massive Galwan casualties.\u201d\n\nTimes Now, on the other hand, claimed, \u201cPhotos of 106 PLA tombstones reveal [the] extent of Chinese casualties in June 15 Galwan clash.\u201d The channel further wrote in a tweet, \u201cPM Modi was right about Galwan grit, pro-China lobby \u2018doubted\u2019 India.\u201d\n\nNewsX and ABP News also broadcast shows where they claimed over 30 graves of Chinese soldiers who died in Galwan clashes were discovered.\n\nThese photographs are of the Chinese military cemetery in Kangxiwa town that contains graves of PLA soldiers martyred in the 1962 Indian-Sino war.\n\nWhile Aaj Tak claimed that 40 PLA soldiers died in the Galwan clashes, India Today did not make a verbal claim on the death toll yet ran images of the cemetery as \u201cproof of massive casualty\u201d. An infographic aired during the show suggested that the cemetery has 105 graves. A defence expert invited on the show, however, said these graves have been present at least since December 2019 and some new graves have recently cropped up.\n\nAlt News found that the Google Earth photo aired by India Today dates back to 2011. As per our calculation as well, there are 105 graves (43 on the left and 62 on the right) in this imagery.\n\nQuite ironically, India Today had used the same map in a report published on August 29 which mentioned that it is from 2011.\n\nWe will break down the rest of the fact-check into two sections that separately count the number of graves on the left and right sides of the cemetery.\n\nNumber of graves on the left\n\nA photograph of the cemetery which is viral on social media was found using Chinese search engine Baidu. It dates back to 2011 and clearly shows 43 graves on the left side. The last row (marked in red) contains only one grave.\n\nOn August 24, the Chinese military had shared a video of their visit to the war memorial on the micro-blogging website Weibo. The same video can also be watched on Chinese video-sharing platform Bilibili. Here, the last row on the left has two graves (marked in red). It\u2019s unclear when the new grave was built, however, it was certainly dug up after 2011. Thus bringing up the total number of graves to 44.\n\nNumber of graves on the right\n\nAnother image of the cemetery circulating on social media gives a clear view of 63 graves on the right. This image is also fairly recent as the last row on the left has two graves (marked in red circle).\n\nIf you notice the above image carefully, the last row on the right contains five graves (marked in red line). However, in the latest visuals uploaded by the Chinese military, there is a new grave in this row (marked in green below) bringing up the total number of graves in the last row to six and the total number of graves on the right side of the cemetery to 64.\n\nThis means the cemetery has 108 graves. The video uploaded by the Chinese military on August 24 also says that there are 108 graves in the war memorial.\n\n[Tip: Upload images on Google docs or Google translate (phone) to extract texts.]\n\nA document uploaded on the website of the Chinese Defence Ministry in April 2020 had put the total number of martyrs buried in Kangxiwa war memorial at 108. The military face-off between Indian and Chinese troops in Galwan reportedly took place in May-June. Thus the imagery aired by Aaj Tak and India Today cannot represent graves of Chinese soldiers martyred in these clashes.\n\nIn fact, we found another picture aired by India Today which dates back to at least December 2019. This picture was uploaded on Chinese question and answer website zhihu.com akin to quora.com. The date can be seen at the bottom of the article.\n\nIt is noteworthy that one of the widely circulating photographs may be recent but we were unable to confirm the antecedents of this grave.\n\nTo sum up the fact-check, India Today used a satellite image from 2011 to report on Chinese casualties in the Galwan clashes. The pictures aired by India Today, Aaj Tak and Times Now show the memorial in Kangxiwa that contains graves of Chinese soldiers who died in the 1962 war with India. Alt News found that at least three new graves were built on the site post-2011. Another picture of a grave that appears to have been recently built is floating online. However, we were unable to confirm the details of this grave.\n\nJournalist Sushant B Sinha tweeted pictures of the Kangxiwa war memorial as graves of Chinese martyrs in the Galwan clashes. \u201cDo not except the \u2018give us proof\u2019 brigade to feel any shame,\u201d he wrote.\n\nNewly-founded website Kreately published a report claiming more than 100 Chinese soldiers were killed in the clashes. This was shared by BJP leader Kapil Mishra and party supporter Sanjay Dixit. Kreately had earlier promoted the false claim that Chinese dissident Yang Jianli had said that 100 Chinese soldiers died in Galwan skirmish.\n\nRishi Bagree tweeted \u201cbig blow to China and Congress\u201d while claiming \u201c35-106\u201d Chinese soldiers fell in the Galwan clashes based on the same set of images.\n\nOther Twitter users that drew hundreds of retweets were @IndoPac_Info and @BefittingFacts.", "lang": "en"}
