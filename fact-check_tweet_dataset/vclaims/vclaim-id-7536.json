He gave campaign donations to Jerry Brown. Gavin Newsom and Barbara Boxer. And on the floor vote, Allen refused to join Republicans opposing driver licenses for illegal aliens.\n\nThe conservative choice is clear: John Cox for governor.\"\n\nThe ad was paid for by John Cox for Governor 2018.\n\nWe\u2019ll examine the other two attacks on Allen in future fact-checks. In this piece, we\u2019ll focus on the claim he donated to top Democrats.\n\nRecent polls show growing support for Cox\u2019s campaign for governor, less than a week after President Trump endorsed the San Diego businessman. A survey released Wednesday night from the Public Policy Institute of California shows Newsom, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, leading Cox, 25 percent to 19 percent.\n\nFormer Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa was third, at 15 percent, followed by Allen with 11 percent, State Treasurer John Chiang at 9 percent and former state schools chief Delaine Eastin with 6 percent.\n\nCox and Allen have sparred at campaign events over who is the most conservative candidate. They\u2019ve both criticized California\u2019s Democratic leadership over the gas tax increase and sanctuary state protections.\n\nThe top two candidates in the June 5 primary, regardless of party affiliation, will move on to the November runoff.\n\nThe ad accuses Allen of donating to three of the state\u2019s top Democrats. The irony, of course, is that Allen\u2019s run for governor has centered on criticizing those same politicians, particularly Brown and Newsom.\n\nWe found clear evidence supporting the claim, though Cox\u2019s ad ignores the fact that the contributions took place nearly a decade ago, before Allen ran for elected office, and that he also donated to Republicans.\n\nCampaign finance records show that in October 2010, Allen donated $1,000 to Jerry Brown for Governor, through Wealth Strategies Group, his wealth management firm in Huntington Beach.\n\nIn August 2010, Allen gave $100 to Gavin Newsom for Lieutenant Governor. And, in October 2010, he donated $250 to Barbara Boxer for Senate.\n\nSOURCE: Campaign finance records from the California Secretary of State's website.\n\nAsked about this, a spokeswoman for Allen\u2019s campaign said in an email that the contributions took place \"before Travis was an elected official, as a businessman, he purchased tickets to some events.\"\n\nA November 2017 Mercury-News article summarized these and additional donations Allen made to Democrats in 2010 and 2011. He told the paper at that time: \"As a businessman I was invited to some events by friends, and I purchased tickets to these events. Attending these events, however, opened my eyes to the damage the Democrats were doing to California, and brought about my decision to do everything in my power to stop them, including running for public office.\"\n\nIn April 2016, PolitiFact California rated Mostly True a similar claim about then Presidential candidate Donald Trump donating to Democrats.\n\nTexas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, at the time Trump\u2019s rival for the Republican presidential nomination, claimed Trump \"has given $12,000 to Jerry Brown, Gavin Newsom and Kamala Harris.\"\n\nCampaign finance data showed the claim was accurate, though we noted Cruz left out that the donations took place long before Trump announced his run for president. The contribution to Jerry Brown took place in 2006, while the donations to the other Democrats took place in 2009, 2011 and 2013.\n\nIn a recent TV ad, John Cox\u2019s campaign for governor claimed rival GOP candidate Travis Allen donated to three of California\u2019s top Democrats.\n\nCampaign records prove the claim, though the contributions took place a decade ago, before Allen entered politics.\n\nThe statement is accurate but needs this clarification.\n\nWe rate it Mostly True.\n\nMOSTLY TRUE \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.\n\nClick here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.", "lang": "en"}
